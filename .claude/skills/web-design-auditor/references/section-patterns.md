## Navigation Patterns

### Effective Navigation Criteria

- **Logo** on the left (or centered for minimal sites), always linking to homepage
- **Links** limited to 5-7 items maximum for cognitive ease
- **CTA button** on the right (distinct from nav links, styled as a button)
- **Sticky/fixed** navigation on scroll for long pages
- **Hamburger menu** on mobile with smooth open/close animation
- **Active state** showing current page/section

### Common Navigation Issues

- Too many links creating choice paralysis
- Logo not clickable or not linking to homepage
- No visible CTA in the navigation
- Mobile menu that is hard to open/close or covers important content
- Navigation that doesn't match the overall design style
- Dropdown menus that are hard to navigate on mobile
- No clear visual distinction between active and inactive nav items

### Navigation Audit Checklist

- [ ] Logo is visible and links to homepage
- [ ] Maximum 5-7 primary navigation items
- [ ] CTA button is visually distinct in the nav
- [ ] Navigation collapses properly on mobile
- [ ] Active page/section is visually indicated
- [ ] Navigation is accessible via keyboard
- [ ] Consistent styling across all pages

## Hero Section Patterns

### Layout Variations

| Pattern | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Split (text + image)** | Text on left, image on right (or vice versa) | Products, SaaS, services with visual demos |
| **Centered text** | Centered heading with supporting text, CTA below | Simple landing pages, announcements |
| **Full-screen image/video** | Background media with text overlay | Visual brands, portfolios, hospitality |
| **Minimal** | Just headline + CTA, no image | Bold statements, text-focused brands |
| **With product screenshot** | App/product mockup prominently featured | SaaS, app downloads |

### Hero Section Must-Haves

- **Headline**: Clear, specific, benefit-oriented (not clever/vague)
- **Subheadline**: 1-2 sentences expanding on the headline
- **CTA**: One primary action button (above the fold)
- **Visual**: Supporting image, video, or illustration
- **Above-the-fold**: All critical content visible without scrolling

### Hero Section Audit Checklist

- [ ] Headline clearly communicates what the business does/offers
- [ ] Value proposition is immediately understandable
- [ ] Primary CTA is visible and has strong contrast
- [ ] CTA text is action-oriented (not just "Learn More")
- [ ] Image/video supports the message (not generic decoration)
- [ ] Text is readable over any background imagery (sufficient contrast)
- [ ] Layout works on both desktop and mobile
- [ ] No text placed over busy/complex image areas (especially faces)

### Common Hero Issues

- Vague or clever headline that doesn't communicate value
- CTA that blends into the background
- Too many CTAs competing for attention
- Image that has no relevance to the message
- Text placed on top of a busy image without overlay
- Critical content pushed below the fold
- Auto-playing video that slows page load

## Feature & Value Proposition Sections

### Layout Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **3-column cards** | Equal cards with icon + heading + text | Feature lists, benefits |
| **Alternating rows** | Text left/image right, then reversed | Detailed feature explanations |
| **Number highlights** | Large numbers with supporting text | Statistics, achievements |
| **Icon grid** | Grid of icons with labels | Quick feature overview |
| **Bento grid** | Asymmetric grid with mixed content | Modern, visual feature showcase |

### Value Proposition Principles

- **Lead with benefits**, not features (what it does for them, not what it is)
- **Be specific**: Numbers, timeframes, and outcomes beat vague claims
- **Address objections**: Anticipate and overcome common concerns
- **Show, don't just tell**: Use images, screenshots, or demos alongside text

### Audit Checklist

- [ ] Benefits are customer-focused (not company-focused)
- [ ] Content is scannable (not walls of text)
- [ ] Icons/images add meaning (not just decoration)
- [ ] Consistent card/component styling
- [ ] Adequate spacing between items
- [ ] Clear heading for each feature/benefit

## Social Proof & Testimonial Sections

### Effective Testimonial Elements

| Element | Impact Level | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Customer name | Medium | Adds authenticity |
| Customer photo | High | Real faces build trust significantly |
| Company/role | High | Adds professional credibility |
| Specific result/number | Very high | "Increased revenue by 40%" beats "Great product" |
| Star rating | Medium | Visual shorthand for quality |
| Date/recency | Low-Medium | Shows ongoing satisfaction |

### Social Proof Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Logo wall** | Row of client/partner logos | B2B credibility |
| **Testimonial cards** | Individual quotes in card format | Service businesses |
| **Carousel/slider** | Rotating testimonials | Multiple reviews, limited space |
| **Case study previews** | Short summaries with metrics + link to full case study | B2B, enterprise |
| **Review aggregates** | "4.8 stars from 500+ reviews" | Products, e-commerce |
| **Video testimonials** | Customer video clips | High-trust industries |

### Audit Checklist

- [ ] Testimonials feel real (specific details, not generic praise)
- [ ] Photos of real people (not stock photos)
- [ ] Company names/roles included where applicable
- [ ] Social proof placed near conversion points (CTAs, forms)
- [ ] Logo sizing is consistent across the logo wall
- [ ] Logos are visible but not overwhelming (gray/monochrome often works well)
- [ ] At least some form of social proof is present on the page

### Common Social Proof Issues

- Generic testimonials ("Great service!") that could be from anyone
- Stock photos used instead of real customer photos
- Logos displayed at wildly different sizes
- Social proof buried at the bottom of the page
- No social proof at all on key conversion pages
- Outdated testimonials with no recent additions

## CTA Sections

### CTA Button Best Practices

| Aspect | Good | Bad |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Text** | "Start Free Trial", "Book a Demo", "Get My Quote" | "Submit", "Learn More", "Click Here" |
| **Color** | High-contrast accent color, distinct from other elements | Same color as other buttons, low contrast |
| **Size** | Large enough to notice and tap (min 44px height) | Small, easy to miss |
| **Position** | Above the fold, repeated at key decision points | Hidden at the bottom, one instance only |
| **Surrounding space** | Plenty of whitespace around the button | Cramped, crowded by other elements |

### CTA Section Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Banner CTA** | Full-width section with centered heading + button | Final page push, between content sections |
| **Inline CTA** | Button within content flow | Blog posts, feature descriptions |
| **Sticky CTA** | Fixed button that stays visible while scrolling | Mobile, high-priority conversions |
| **Dual CTA** | Primary + secondary option ("Start Trial" + "Watch Demo") | When two paths are equally valid |

### CTA Audit Checklist

- [ ] Primary CTA is immediately visible on page load
- [ ] CTA text describes the action and value (not just "Submit")
- [ ] Button color has high contrast against background
- [ ] Clear visual distinction between primary and secondary CTAs

## Pricing Sections

### Effective Pricing Design

- **Tier clarity**: 2-4 tiers maximum, clearly differentiated
- **Recommended tier**: Visually highlighted (larger, different color, "Most Popular" badge)
- **Feature comparison**: Clear table or list showing what's included in each tier
- **Price anchoring**: Show annual savings prominently, position expensive tier before target tier
- **Free option**: If available, use it to reduce barrier to entry
- **FAQ nearby**: Address common pricing objections immediately below

### Pricing Audit Checklist

- [ ] Tiers are easy to compare at a glance
- [ ] Recommended/target plan is visually highlighted
- [ ] Pricing is clear (no hidden fees impression)
- [ ] Annual vs monthly toggle works clearly

| **Carousel** | Horizontal scrolling showcase | Featured work, limited space |
| **Bento box** | Mixed-size grid (1 large + several small) | Hero galleries, featured + supporting images |

---

## Contact & Form Sections

### Form Design Best Practices

- **Minimal fields**: Only ask for what's absolutely needed (each extra field reduces completion ~7%)
- **Clear labels**: Label each field clearly (placeholder text alone is insufficient)
- **Smart defaults**: Pre-fill where possible, use appropriate input types
- **Inline validation**: Show errors as they occur, not after submission
- **Progress indicator**: For multi-step forms, show progress
- **Confirmation**: Clear success message after submission

### Form Field Styling

- Rounded corners for a modern, friendly feel
- Consistent padding inside fields (12-16px)
- Gray or light-colored background (subtle distinction from page)
