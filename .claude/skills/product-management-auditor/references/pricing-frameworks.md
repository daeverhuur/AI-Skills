## Tier Structure Evaluation

When auditing a pricing page, evaluate each tier against three balancing factors:

1. **Perceived value**: Does each tier provide enough value to justify its price?
2. **Price sensitivity**: Does the pricing align with each segment's willingness to pay?
3. **Problem-solution fit**: Does each tier solve a distinct set of problems for its target segment?

### Tier Analysis Checklist

For each tier, verify:
- [ ] Clear name that implies the target audience (Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
- [ ] Feature list is scannable (not overwhelming)
- [ ] Value differentiation between tiers is obvious
- [ ] Price jump between tiers is justified by added value
- [ ] One tier is visually highlighted as recommended (anchoring)
- [ ] CTA button text is action-oriented and distinct per tier

### Feature Distribution Rules

- Each tier should have just enough value to appeal to its target group
- The next tier should have something compelling enough to justify the upgrade
- Basic features should not be gated behind premium tiers (creates frustration)
- Power features should create natural upgrade triggers

## Pricing Psychology Checklist

Evaluate whether the pricing page uses these techniques:

- [ ] **Anchoring**: Is the most expensive (or recommended) plan shown first or prominently?
- [ ] **Decoy pricing**: Is there a tier designed to make another look like better value?
- [ ] **Annual discount**: Is yearly pricing shown with savings highlighted?
- [ ] **Price ending**: Are prices ending in 9 or 7 (psychological pricing)?
- [ ] **Free trial/tier**: Is there a zero-risk entry point?
- [ ] **Social proof on pricing**: Are customer counts or testimonials shown near pricing?
- [ ] **Money-back guarantee**: Is a refund policy visible to reduce perceived risk?
- [ ] **Comparison table**: Can users easily compare features across tiers?
- [ ] **FAQ section**: Are common pricing objections addressed?

## Free Tier & Trial Analysis

Evaluate the free offering:

### Free Trial
- **Duration**: Is it long enough for the user to experience core value? (7-14 days typical)
- **Feature access**: Full access vs limited features?
- **Credit card required**: Requiring CC upfront reduces signups but increases conversion
- **Onboarding**: Is there guided onboarding to accelerate time-to-value?
- **Upgrade prompts**: Are there natural upgrade triggers within the trial?

### Freemium
- **Value ceiling**: Does the free tier provide enough value to be useful but not so much that upgrading feels unnecessary?
- **Usage limits**: Are limits clear and reasonable?
- **Upgrade triggers**: Do users naturally hit limits during normal usage?
- **Branding**: Does the free tier include product branding (viral growth)?

## Common Pricing Anti-Patterns

Flag these issues during audit:

1. **Too many tiers**: More than 4 tiers creates decision paralysis
2. **No free option**: Missing free trial or freemium reduces top-of-funnel
3. **Hidden pricing**: "Contact sales" for all tiers signals enterprise-only focus
4. **Feature overload**: Too many features listed per tier makes comparison impossible
5. **No recommended tier**: Without anchoring, users default to cheapest option
6. **Unclear value metric**: Pricing based on metrics users don't understand
7. **No annual discount**: Missing incentive for longer commitment
8. **Missing guarantee**: No refund or cancellation policy increases perceived risk
9. **Enterprise-only features in low tiers**: Confuses the target audience
10. **No upgrade path visibility**: Users can't see what they'll get by upgrading
