## 1. First Impressions & Value Proposition (Bounce Rate Impact)

Navigate to the homepage. Evaluate:

- **Value proposition clarity**: Can a visitor understand what the product does within 5 seconds?
- **Headline effectiveness**: Is it specific, benefit-driven, and jargon-free?
- **CTA visibility**: Is the primary call-to-action above the fold and clearly visible?
- **Visual hierarchy**: Does the page guide the eye to the most important elements first?
- **Trust signals**: Are there logos, testimonials, security badges, or social proof visible?
- **Page load perception**: Does the page feel fast and responsive?

Score: 1-5 for each criterion.

## 2. Conversion Funnel Analysis

Navigate through the primary conversion path (sign-up, purchase, or lead capture). Evaluate:

- **Number of steps**: Count clicks/pages from landing to conversion
- **Form friction**: Number of fields, required vs optional, inline validation
- **Progress indicators**: Does the user know where they are in the process?
- **Exit points**: Are there distracting links or navigation that lead away from conversion?
- **Error handling**: Submit incomplete forms to check for helpful error messages
- **Social login / SSO**: Are low-friction sign-up options available?
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Test the funnel on mobile viewport

Metric targets:
- Form fields: Fewer is better. Each additional field reduces conversion ~7%
- Steps to conversion: 3 or fewer is ideal
- CTR on primary CTA: Benchmark against industry (2-5% typical)

## 3. Onboarding & Activation

If a free trial or demo is available, evaluate the onboarding flow:

- **Time to value (TTV)**: How quickly can a new user experience the core benefit?
- **Empty states**: Are blank screens helpful (guided) or confusing (empty)?
- **Progressive disclosure**: Is complexity introduced gradually?
- **Checklist / progress**: Is there an onboarding checklist or progress tracker?
- **Tooltips and guidance**: Are interactive guides or tooltips present?
- **Aha moment path**: Is the user guided toward the product's core value quickly?

## 4. Retention & Engagement Signals

Evaluate features that drive return visits:

- **Email capture**: Are there newsletter signups, content upgrades, or lead magnets?
- **Notification systems**: Push notifications, email digests, or in-app notifications
- **Content freshness**: Is content regularly updated (blog dates, news, changelog)?
- **Community features**: Forums, comments, user-generated content
- **Personalization**: Does the experience adapt to the user?
- **Habit loops**: Are there triggers that bring users back (daily summaries, streaks, updates)?
- **Feature depth**: Are there features that increase engagement over time?

## 5. Pricing & Monetization

Navigate to the pricing page. Evaluate:

- **Tier clarity**: Can users quickly understand what each tier offers?
- **Value anchoring**: Is the recommended plan visually highlighted?
- **Free tier / trial**: Is there a risk-free way to start?
- **Feature comparison**: Is there a clear comparison table?
- **Price-to-value alignment**: Does each tier justify its price jump?
- **Annual vs monthly**: Are annual discounts prominent?
- **Objection handling**: Are FAQs, guarantees, or cancellation policies visible?

## 6. User Experience & Navigation

Evaluate the overall UX:

- **Navigation clarity**: Can users find key pages within 2 clicks?
- **Search functionality**: Is there a search bar? Does it return relevant results?
- **Mobile experience**: Test responsive breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Check contrast ratios, alt text, keyboard navigation
- **Loading states**: Are there skeleton screens or spinners during load?
- **Error pages**: Check 404 page for helpfulness
- **Breadcrumbs / orientation**: Does the user always know where they are?

## 7. Trust & Social Proof

Evaluate elements that build credibility:

- **Testimonials**: Real names, photos, company names, specific results
- **Case studies**: Detailed success stories with metrics
- **Logos**: Client or partner logos prominently displayed
- **Reviews / ratings**: Third-party review integration
- **Security**: SSL, privacy policy, data handling transparency
- **Team / about page**: Does the company feel real and trustworthy?

## 8. Growth & Virality Mechanics

Evaluate built-in growth loops:

- **Referral program**: Is there a refer-a-friend mechanism?
- **Social sharing**: Can users share content or achievements?
- **Embeddable content**: Are there widgets, badges, or embed codes?
- **SEO foundations**: Meta titles, descriptions, heading structure, URL structure
- **Content marketing**: Blog quality, frequency, and SEO optimization
- **Backlink potential**: Is there linkable content (tools, data, reports)?

## Scoring & Prioritization

### Per-Category Scoring (1-5)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Excellent — Professional quality, no issues |
| 4 | Good — Minor improvements possible |
| 3 | Average — Several noticeable issues |
| 2 | Below average — Significant problems |
| 1 | Poor — Major redesign needed |

### RICE Framework for Recommendations

Score each finding:

- **Reach**: How many users does this affect? (1-10 scale, 10 = all users)
- **Impact**: How much will this improve the target metric? (0.25 = minimal, 0.5 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high, 3 = massive)
- **Confidence**: How certain are you? (100% = high, 80% = medium, 50% = low)
- **Effort**: Person-months to implement (lower = better)
- **RICE Score**: (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort

### Priority Categories

- **P1 - Quick Wins**: High RICE score, low effort. Implement immediately.
- **P2 - Strategic**: High impact but higher effort. Plan for next sprint.
- **P3 - Nice-to-have**: Moderate impact. Backlog for future consideration.
- **P4 - Defer**: Low impact relative to effort. Icebox.
