In this course, you'll learn everything you need to create beautiful, fully functional websites from start to
0:05
finish. We're going to cover the full process of web design, from planning to strategizing to structuring the right
0:10
content and creating great user experience, then designing beautiful images and interface to make sure the
0:16
website is delightful. And we're going to end up with developing the websites and then publishing it. You're going to
0:22
get a crash course in Figma to design the website and then Web Flow to develop it. And there's absolutely no knowledge
0:28
required for this course as I'm recording this with beginners in mind. We'll be working on a project together.
0:34
So hopefully you can finish this course with a great website under your belt that you can use in your design portfolio. My name is Ron Seal. I've
0:41
been a designer for the past 20 years working with clients of all shapes and sizes. And for the past 5 years, I've
0:46
also been teaching thousands of designers on Flux Academy on how to become successful web designers. Web
0:52
design is such a great vocation. It's creative. It's technical. You get to collaborate with interesting businesses.
0:58
And you can work from anywhere. And since every business in the world needs a website, there's always a need for web
1:04
designers. Let me be super honest about my goals with this course. I want to get you to the point where you can build
1:09
simple websites yourself, perhaps even start charging for them so that you're super excited about web design. And when
1:15
you're ready to go professional, you'll take one of our advanced courses and join Flux Community. So, this course is
1:22
going to be long because I'm going deep. And I realize that long video can be a little daunting. So, we broke this
1:27
course into five chapters. And you can use the link below this video to enroll in a free 5-day course, which will break
1:34
down this course into a chapter a day with additional resources and bonus materials. You don't have to, of course,
1:40
but this will increase your chances of completing the course successfully. So, I highly encourage it. With that said,
1:46
let's get started.
Chapter One: The Process
1:51
Before we dive into actually designing the website, let's take a 30-foot view and talk about what the process looks
1:57
like. Now, there's actually two types of processes. The amateur process and the professional process. The amateur
2:03
process is basically taking a template and then customizing it to fit your or your client's need. The professional
2:08
process is starting from a blank canvas and designing a custom solution for your specific needs. In this course, I'm not
2:16
going to get into the amateur process because I don't think it will get you very far and I don't see much future in
2:22
that. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of designers out there who are working today and some of them are charging anywhere from $500 to maybe $3,000 for
2:30
customizing a template, but to be fair, most clients can do that on their own. And with AI and the tools that are
2:36
getting easier to use, it's going to be very difficult to keep doing that. Not to mention that is not as creative and
2:42
fun as the professional process. The professional process is the same process used by agencies who are charging
2:49
$50,000 to $100,000 or even more per website. Now, that won't be easily
2:54
replaced with AI. Actually, I will show you on this course how to use AI tools to make your professional process even
3:00
better. So, what does the professional process looks like? Step one, planning
3:06
and strategy. At this stage, we're trying to figure out why are we even building this
3:11
website? Who is it for? What are they trying to accomplish? How will we know if we succeed? We do that by having
3:17
conversation with our clients and doing research. This will help us to create a brief which will serve as the compass
3:23
for this project. Step number two, structure or UX. At this stage, we're
3:29
going to decide what pages we need on the website and what content we're going to have on each page. Then we'll develop
3:35
this content into wireframes, which is basically gray ugly sketches that just show us the structure and the content of
3:42
each page, but without any design or color or or images. This is what some people call user experience because it
3:49
includes how people orient themselves through the digital space of our website and how easy it is for them to find what
3:55
they're actually looking for. Step three, design or UI. At this stage, we're starting to bring the magic into
4:02
the wireframes. We'll choose the colors and font that will help to communicate the right message. We'll bring images,
4:08
illustrations, and iconography to bring emotion and clarity into the design. Some people call this phase UI, but this
4:16
is much more than just interface of buttons and forms. This is actually storytelling. This stage can really make
4:23
or break the project. Step number four, development. The last step is to bring the design to
4:30
life by turning it into code. This means making sure that it looks great on all devices and that the design is
4:37
accessible. It will also include interactions and animations. However, worry not because although many people
4:42
like to code websites themselves and these people are called front-end developer, there are powerful noode
4:47
tools today like web flow that enable designers to visually turn their websites into highquality code without
4:54
actually writing any code. And that's what we'll be doing in this course. Now to be fully fair, some people who are
4:59
doing the amateur process in working with templates will include strategy and custom photography to increase the
5:05
quality of their results and some professionals will use templates or UI kits to speed up their process. But in
5:11
any case, you will benefit greatly from understanding the professional process. So in the next chapters, we'll dive deep
5:18
into each step of this process and we'll learn both the theory and also put this in action by working on an example
5:24
project. Let's get started.
Chapter Two: Strategy
5:30
Eison said that if he had a one hour to solve a problem to save his life, he would spend 55 minutes determining the
5:37
proper question to ask. So, while you're probably pretty excited to jump into a design software and start creating
5:42
something pretty cool, the first thing that we're actually going to do is spend time figuring out what it is that we're
5:48
trying to design. Or in other words, what problem are we trying to solve with this website? We call this website
5:54
strategy. The essence of a strategy is to understand where we are today and where we want to be in the future so
6:00
that we can draw a plan on how to get there. Now, I've mentioned earlier that every business needs a website. However,
6:06
every company is different and therefore every company needs a different website. First, let's figure out what type of
6:12
website we need to build. Then, let's figure out what the goals of the website are. When we're thinking about website,
6:18
there is basically five big categories of websites that they fall into. First is e-commerce. These are website where
6:25
you buy stuff online and you probably know and use these types of website all the time. The second type of website is
6:30
a marketing website or a business website. Whereas basically the website is a business card of the website
6:37
online. It presents the website. It tells the story of the website and it basically shows information about that
6:42
company. The third type of website is a content website or a media outlet. That is a website where you go in to consume
6:49
information. And so you can think about blogs, you can think about magazines or curation for inspirational websites.
6:55
These are website where you go to consume information whether that's text, image or video. This is a content
7:02
website. The fourth type of website is an educational website whose goal is to teach you something. So you go to this
7:08
website to consume information in order to learn. So that might be an online course or uh a lot of information about
7:15
a certain topic. The goal there is to teach you something using text or
7:20
images. The fifth type of website is a portfolio website which is a website that is designed to show you work that
7:27
this company, this person, freelancer or agency can do. So this is kind of like a proof of concept. It shows projects that
7:34
this company has created and the goal there is to show their expertise by showing different case studies. There's
7:40
an additional type of website that people tend to confuse when talking about web design and these are websites
7:45
like Google, Airbnb or Twitter. These websites are actually apps that we interact with and they are very
7:52
different than the types of other website that we've just mentioned and they are more complex. So, we're not going to dive into tackling them in this
7:59
course. Depending on what type of website we're building, we're going to have different goals. Some of the possible goals for a website can be
8:05
selling products or services, building trust, generating leads, or providing
8:10
value and education. It can be help with hiring. To figure out which one of these is going to be the right one for our
8:17
project, we need to spend time with our clients in what we call a strategy session where we learn about their
8:22
current situation, their offering, their customers, and their vision for the future. This helps us understand what
8:29
part the website is going to play in their more broad business strategy and what content we'll need to include in
8:35
the website. Okay, enough about theory. Let's see this in action. My friend Omar has just launched a new pharmaceutical
8:41
company and they need a website. I sat down with him to learn about his company and what he needs in his new website.
8:46
His new company is called Massix and they are leading the way in a new medical use of silocybin which you might
8:52
know as magic mushroom. It's a really exciting project that has the potential to change how the healthcare industry is
8:57
helping people suffering from addiction and post trauma. However, it has a challenge. People tend to associate
9:04
psiliocybin with hepes and recreational drug use and not with professional
9:09
medical care. Since the company is very young, we don't have a product on the market yet. And the website is going to be rather simple. The main challenge on
9:16
this project is going to be to help them build trust and look credible so that they have easier time when they're
9:22
talking to investors and partners. Based on my conversation with Omar, I'm going to create a brief for this project. By
9:28
the way, if you want this brief template, make sure you've signed up to our free 5-day email course to get all
9:34
the additional goodies. Now, the last thing I asked Omar is to give me some references of websites in the
9:39
pharmaceutical space that he thinks are doing good job in building trust. This
9:44
helps to align our expectation on what credible websites look like and it's going to avoid me designing something
9:51
that I think looks great but he feels is really far off. Okay, enough about me.
9:56
How about you try now? I encourage you to find a friend, a family member, or a local business that needs a website. Go
10:03
and talk to them about their needs. Fill in the brief template so that you'll be ready to design for them in the next
10:08
chapters of this course. Now that we're clear on what the strategy of the website is, it's time to move on to the
10:13
next step and create the structure and content for our website.
Chapter Three: Structure
10:21
The next step is to turn our strategy brief into content that's structured in a meaningful way that would help the
10:26
visitor find what they're looking for and help them to achieve their goals. Let's take a look at how websites are structured. First of all, website have
10:34
pages. Some of them have a lot of pages, others have just a single page. You can compare this to a house. Some have many
10:40
rooms and some have just a single room and that depends on their need and the budget. Some of the most common pages
10:46
are homepage, about page, product or services page, blog page, and contact
10:53
page. Each page is then made up of different sections. You can think about these sections as chapters in a book or
10:59
slides in a presentation. Each of them has their purpose in telling a short story and leading you to the next one.
11:06
Some of the most common sections are navigation. Navigation helps you to understand what content is on the
11:11
website. And if your website is just a single page, it might help you understand just what different sections you have on that page. It also helps you
11:18
to understand whose website is this because the navigation usually includes a logo. Hero section. The first section
11:25
in every page is always called the hero section. The reason it's called a hero is because it has a huge role in the
11:30
story that we're telling. It's going to tell us very quickly what's here, what's on this page, and why we should stay on
11:37
this page. It's one of the most important sections in every page. Features section is where we showcase
11:42
what's included in the product or service. A call to action section or CTA
11:47
as we sometimes call it, is where we encourage the visitor to take some kind of an action. A testimonial section is
11:54
where we show happy customers. Pricing section is where we explain how much things cost. A gallery section is where
12:01
we can show a variety of images. A contact section is where we tell people how they can contact us. And every page
12:08
has a footer section whose role is to clearly outline all the pages on the website and all the additional
12:14
information that we might be required to put such as privacy, terms of service, copyrights, and the footer also helps us
12:21
to clearly understand that we've reached the end of the page because everybody knows that there's a footer at the end
12:26
of every page. Each section in turn is made out of elements each serving its own purpose. Some of the most common
12:32
elements on the web are type such as heading and paragraphs to convey
12:37
information. We have buttons and links that enables us to lead us to different
12:42
types of places or take different actions. We have images or videos that help us to convey information in a
12:48
visual way. We have forms that allow us to submit information. The first thing when we're working on a website
12:54
structure is to create a site map. The goal of a sitemap is to map out all the different pages that we might need for
13:01
our website and all the different sections that we might need on every single page. Once you have that, you can
13:07
move into the second step which is to turn these sitemap into wireframes. Wireframes is what we call the
13:13
lowfidelity design. That basically means that we don't spend time thinking about colors, fonts, and images, and we just
13:21
take care of the structures of the section and the elements on the page. To show you how this looks like in action,
13:27
I'm going to continue working on my massics projects. Now, I personally like to do these steps with pen and paper,
13:32
but I'll also show you other alternatives later on. So, the first question I need to consider for the
13:38
massics project is how many pages I need. Now this company is still in very
13:44
early stages and we don't want to share too much on either the product or the team. So it makes sense to use a single
13:50
page website. We call these one pagers. Next, what sections do we need on this page? First of all, we need navigation.
13:57
Yeah, even if it's just for a single page. Next, we need a hero section to tell people who we are and what we do
14:04
and why they need to care about this. Next, we want to share more about what the company does, but since it doesn't
14:09
have a public offering right now, and we want to create intrigue and a big promise, we can share the company mission and vision. Next, we'll give an
14:16
overview of the product that they're working on. And next, to build trust, we can use the list of partners since they
14:23
already partnered with established medical and research institution. If we show the logos of these institution,
14:29
that would really help us look more credible. Lastly, we'll conclude with a contact section that will allow
14:34
interested investors and collaborators to reach out. And of course, every page always needs a footer to close the page.
14:41
Okay, so we have a simple site map. Now, let's expand that into wireframe. Again,
14:47
I like to do this on pen and paper because it feels faster to visualize how the website is going to look like. So,
14:52
I'm drawing a long rectangular for the whole page and then I start drawing out the sections navigation with space for
14:58
the logo and some of the section names. Note that I'm not really writing or drawing the logo. I'm just doing boxes
15:04
and lines. Next, the hero section, which will probably have a heading, a paragraph, a call to action button, and
15:11
an image. Now, there are a lot of layouts for the hero section that I could use. Left alone, center align,
15:16
full screen, but I'm not too worried about this right now. Next, I'll draw the mission section when the product
15:22
section. And I might switch sides for the text just to mix things up. Uh, a line of logos and a contact form. Now
15:29
that I have my ugly drawing, I'm clear on what content I need. I need these headings. I need these paragraph, these
15:36
images, and so on. Now, usually when working with clients, you want to share these wireframes with them to make sure
15:42
that they are clear on the content and structure of the website before you start spending tons of time on making
15:48
this look good just to discover that you're working on the wrong structure. Now, you're probably not going to show
15:54
them this sketch. Uh you want to share some kind of a digital version of this. So, let me show you how you can do this
16:00
digitally. Okay. So, the first tool I want to show you is the Reloom AI site builder. And you can give this a try for
16:07
free. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into the site builder and it's going to open up a new, as you can
16:13
see, uh a new site map. Now, we can generate a custom site map by describing
16:18
the company right here. So, I'm going to paste my description. Massex is a new pharmaceutical company working on
16:23
innovative healthcare solution. Basically, a description of the company. I'm going to set this up as 1 to five
16:29
pages and I'm going to hit generate and let's see what this does. So it's
16:35
thinking and now it generated basically started by generating three pages home
16:40
about us research and contact and it's also basically generating the sections
16:45
for us. So navbar hero header section and it tells us what's going to be included here. Introduce massics with a
16:52
strong and compelling image and video background showcasing the innovative approach. um about section, team
16:58
section, FAQ section, call to action section, and footer section. So, as you can see, it's not very different from
17:05
what we've done previously. And it also suggests three uh pages here. Now, what
17:11
I can do if I want is I can delete these pages because I want this to be a single
17:16
page. So, I'm going to delete these. And I can also go ahead and adjust the
17:22
suggestions from here. So, uh, hero section, we want, navbar, we want, about
17:27
section is also we want. Team section, we don't want. So, I'm going to rightclick this. I'm going to delete
17:32
this. FAQ, I also don't want. So, I'm going to delete this. The one thing that I did want, uh, so I'm going to click
17:40
plus here, and it's going to suggest a bunch of section types. So, what I wanted to do is, uh, maybe features
17:47
section to talk a little bit about the product. And I can also write here product
17:52
section. And then what I also wanted was ba basically the logos of the partners. So
17:58
let's see what they're offering us right now. Uh we have a logo list. So this is great. So I'm going to rename this
18:06
partners list. Okay. So basically now I
18:11
have a very simple site map pretty close to what I did uh with you know just
18:17
sketching this out. But here's when things get pretty wild is where I click this wireframe tool and now it's going
18:24
to take the sitemap and actually going to go ahead and design the site map for
18:29
us. So let's see how that happens. So as you can see the reloom tool have gone
18:35
ahead and created the whole wireframe for me. Looks pretty good and it also included the copy for me which can be
18:42
very very helpful. So one more thing that I want to show you is that in this case I can click one of the components
18:48
and because realum in general is basically a component library I can go ahead and replace the component and
18:55
start playing around with different layouts. Now I've mentioned that I don't care too much about layouts right now if
19:02
it looks you know with a text on the left an image on the right or image background but I just want to show you
19:07
how crazy it is that you've got all of these options here and also inspiration actually for the layout. um just to get
19:14
started. So now we have a very clear uh and beautiful wireframe that we can go
19:20
ahead and share with our clients. So at this point you might be saying, "Wow, Ron, you've made this in a second. Why
19:27
bother showing us all of the stuff that you did with a pen and paper before?" And to be fair, this is a valid question
19:33
and this is a super super helpful tool that I personally use uh on all project. However, because you're a beginner, I
19:39
still think it's very very valuable to take a few minutes and try to think things through with your head before
19:45
you're delegating your whole thinking to AI just to know that it makes sense. For example, we've made adjustments to the
19:52
number of pages and we've made adjustment to some of the sections on the site map itself. So, it is worth
19:58
taking some time and based on the conversation that you had with your clients, make sure that what you're getting here is really what you want.
20:05
That being said, this is very very helpful. Now, I'm not going to actually
20:10
go ahead and use these uh wireframes. And the reason that I'm not going to do them is number one to use these
20:18
wireframes in Figma, which is the tool that we're going to go and use later to design them is a paid feature. And I
20:23
want to make sure that you're able to do this for free. And also, the components, the Figma components that Realum give
20:30
you are pretty advanced components. So you need to be an advanced Figma user to try to understand how to design using
20:36
them. And I want to keep things very very simple and show you what you can do very easily for free. So we're going to
20:43
use this as a reference, but we're not going to actually use these components. However, give Reloom a try and if you
20:49
want, you can uh there's an affiliate link that you if you use it, it's going to help support us. And also just
20:56
saying, you know, web flow masterclass students get two months of free of real, which is a really, really great benefit.
21:02
Just saying. All right, let me show you now how I'm creating these wireframes myself in Figma. Okay, so let's rebuild
21:09
our wireframes in Figma. And if if this is your first time in Figma, worry not. We're going to take it really, really slow. You can open up a new Figma
21:16
account for free and open up a new project. And this is what you'll have, an empty file. The first thing I
21:21
actually want to do is before I'm designing is I took a screenshot or uh a photo of the wireframes that I've
21:27
sketched and I'm just going to drop that inside. So I have kind of like a reference of what it is that I want to
21:35
design here. So let's go ahead and create a page for ourselves. And I'm going to do this by opening up here and
21:41
clicking on this frame thing. And then I have a bunch of presets right here on the right. And I'm going to select
21:47
desktop. So now I have this page here. It's not very long. So I can click here
21:53
and drag this a little bit so that we have it and it's long. I can also in Figma zoom in and out by hitting command
22:00
plus and minus um and pan things around um with my mouse this way or by holding
22:07
you know the shift uh the shift key and then holding to pen. Okay. So this is
22:13
what we have. What we want to create here is this rectangular to as a
22:18
placeholder for the logo and then a bunch of maybe the sections that we have here. So, first let's create a
22:24
rectangular for the logo. I'm going to hit the rectangular uh tool right here and just drag.
22:31
This is a placeholder for the logo. Great. Next thing, let's open uh hold
22:37
the text one and let's write here. So, the first one is going to be mission,
22:43
right? And the text is a little bit small. So you can see right here from the right from the text panel. Let's
22:49
make this maybe 18. Uh and maybe make this a little semi bold. I don't care too much about the design. I don't have
22:56
to figure this out right now. But just so that we can see what we're doing here, I'm going to drag it here. And let's think about the sections that we
23:02
have here. So we have mission and then we have maybe product
23:08
and then we have partners or maybe just contact. I think that's enough. I don't want to put the I think three links here
23:15
are enough. Okay, so this is what we have here. Now we have basically a
23:20
placeholder for an image which is also just a rectangular. So I can hit R as a
23:26
shortcut for this rectangular and just drag here. Going to have an image here maybe. And then I need a heading. So for
23:33
the text specifically, Massix have helped me provide the text for this which is again it's unique. Sometimes
23:39
you might use an AI tool to write you or you can do the writing for your clients on your own which is very helpful and
23:45
you can charge money for which is a big topic. We have a full course called right side just about writing copy for
23:51
websites. It's out of the scope for this course but for this one luckily I was provided with the text so I'm going to
23:57
use that and if you haven't you can use what the Reloom AI builder you can copy from there and paste it right here. So,
24:04
let me go ahead and paste some of the text. And because this is going to be a heading, let's make this really big. So,
24:09
let's do something like 50. And I can go ahead and as you can see, we have a box binding this text. And if I make the box
24:16
smaller, it's going to Yeah, it's going to make the text into a multi-line text,
24:21
which is great. Maybe it's a little too big, but okay. Something like this. So,
24:26
we have a heading. We also had kind of a subheading here. Silosin pioneers. Um,
24:33
and for that I'm just going to duplicate a text. So, how do I duplicate a text?
24:38
Uh, you can hit it and you can do copy and paste, command C, commandV, and duplicate it. That's one way to do it.
24:45
Another way to do it is by just dragging it while you're holding the option or
24:50
alt key, and that would just create a duplicate. So, that's an easy way for me to duplicate. And now I can paste the
24:56
text here. Um, because basically I'm going to have a lot of text elements here. So, we've got that right. Okay,
25:04
we've got the hero section done. Okay, next section. Basically, I've made it here. The X in the background basically
25:11
said that it's on top of an image. Again, I don't know if I'm going to do this, but for now, let's do this. Let's
25:16
duplicate this image by dragging it while holding the option key. Let's make it as if it's a section that has, you
25:24
know, the image on the all all of this area. And I'm going to drag this heading
25:29
here. And let's do the mass mission.
25:35
Yeah. So, let's do this. Of course, if it's going to be centered, I'm going to need to change the centering, but I
25:41
don't care too much about layout at this point. And then we've got this is the actual text. So, let's grab this text.
25:50
Now, you can see that I I don't see the text. The reason is this text is behind
25:56
this rectangular. And you can see it because right here on the layers panel, this is actually under this rectangular
26:03
three. So I can just bring it up and now you can see it. So we have layers. So if something is under a layer, you're we're
26:10
not going to be able to see it. I'm going to paste this here. Again, everything is temporary. This is just a
26:16
placeholder. Um, and I guess introducing new area for medicine. I don't know what
26:22
to do with this. Let's put this as a heading here for now. I'm not sure how I'm going to use this later. The next
26:28
section that we have is another image with another heading and some text. So,
26:34
basically, I can just duplicate this whole thing, I think, and just drag this down here. And let's see what we have
26:42
here. So, here we have uh the product. Actually, maybe let's use this as the
26:49
heading, as the big heading. Let's use the massics product as the smaller
26:54
heading above the heading. And let's take this
27:01
text and dup duplicate this small heading.
27:07
Paste this here. And okay, we've got another section here. The next section
27:12
is these logos, list of logos. So, we can actually take the logo that we have
27:17
here, uh, duplicate it by holding the alt key, option key. By the way, I need
27:24
this page to be longer. So, I'm going to hit, uh, select the page, the title of the page at the top, and then I'm just
27:30
going to drag this to make the page a little bit longer. Let's duplicate
27:36
one, two, three logos, I guess. And I can also hold the shift while I'm dragging to make sure that it stays in
27:42
line so that they are all aligned. So, we've got these here. Maybe we'll need kind of like a heading, our
27:49
partners or something like this. So, let me drag this. Let's take our partners.
27:55
Not going to bring in the images at this point because I don't care about this at this point. And the last section is some
28:02
kind of a form, contact us. So, basically, let's duplicate this again.
28:08
Let's duplicate this whole thing. Let's make the page a little bit longer again so that we have a little bit more space.
28:15
And this is going to be contact us. So contact contact
28:21
us. And in this case we probably need some kind of a form. So I'm actually going to duplicate this uh rectangular
28:30
for an image. And this time it's going to be kind of like a form. So let's zoom in. Let's do a name and drag this on top
28:37
of it. going to select both of them and drag while holding option and shift to
28:42
duplicate this below. I'm going to do email here and let's drag this again and
28:49
maybe this one. Let's make it a little bit bigger because that's going to be message. And then we also need a button.
28:56
So let's duplicate this and this. Let's do here submit. Submit.
29:02
Um okay. So now we have a button for this form. So now we've created a sketch of a
29:09
contact form. That looks okay. Maybe we can bring it up a little bit, but it doesn't really matter. And the last
29:15
thing that we have is basically the footer, which the footer basically I think is just going to include Oh, we
29:22
also need investors, contact, and an email. So let's copy this.
29:27
Um, let's bring this here. Let's maybe copy this. Not sure where I'm placing
29:33
this yet, but let's place it here temporarily. And then
29:40
what do we have? We have the copyrights for the footer. So we can create can
29:45
duplicate this. Paste the footer. And I'm just going to give this color just
29:51
so that it looks a little bit different so that we know that we are in the footer. And this is the end of the page.
29:59
Okay. So we are pretty much done. Okay.
30:05
And it is okay. We have now a digital wireframe. We'll use this later on to as
30:12
the basis of our design. I know that it's ugly right now, but this is actually good enough for us to share
30:18
with the clients and get their perspective whether the texts are good, whether the structure is good, whether something is missing and we're ready to
30:25
move on to the next phase. So, I encourage you to stop, go work on your
30:31
project, turn your strategy brief into a sitemap first and then wireframes later,
30:36
catch up to us, and let's move to the next phase where we're actually making this look good.
Chapter Four: Design
30:45
Finally, we're at the creative and fun part of the project, the design. Now, some people call this stage UI design,
30:51
but I feel like the term user interface doesn't really do justice to what when it comes to web design. Maybe when
30:58
you're designing the interface of an ATM or a dashboard, um then user interface
31:03
makes sense. But when it comes to websites, you know, we have uh interface elements like buttons and forms and
31:09
navigation, but we also have a lot of imagery and longer text and there's much more storytelling that goes into design
31:15
uh than other forms of UI design. So, it's much more than UI design. Now, the core of what we're going to do in this
31:21
part is basically graphic design or what they call visual communication. meaning we're going to use things like color and
31:28
type and visual to communicate a message. Now, we already know what the literal message is because we already
31:34
have the text on our website, but graphic design really helps to reinforce the message. Now, let me show you what I
31:41
mean. Here are three examples of a poster with the same message. The message is I love you. But you can
31:47
clearly read a completely different story in each one of them because of how we use the color and the typography and
31:54
the imagery. So you already know this because you live in our society and you read thousands of visual message all day
32:01
long. However, as a designer, you really need to be fully aware on how to use these tools to convey the right message.
32:08
Now, the topic of this is of course huge and we have a full-blown course on Flux
32:13
Academy on core design skills. But for the purpose of this course, we're going to make it really simple and just ask
32:19
ourselves the question, what message did this choice uh sends or conveys on
32:24
everything that we do. Okay. So, another thing that's going to help us is inspiration and references because we're
32:31
not inventing visual communication from scratch, right? people um are used to reading design all day long. So, it's
32:39
worth collecting some references of what we feel is telling the right story so that we can learn what choices other
32:45
people made to tell similar stories. So, that's actually going to be our first step. But before I'm heading off for my
32:53
search and collection, I need to know what I'm looking for. So it's going to be really really useful to refer back to
32:58
our brief at this point and collect a few keywords that I can use to search for the project that I'm working on.
33:05
Some of the keywords can be something like healthcare or medical pharmaceutical psyocybin magic mushroom
33:13
and scientific. Okay, so it's time to search. But where do we search? Now there are endless of sources where you
33:19
can look for inspiration when it comes to design. We actually have a free ebook with a big collection of places where
33:25
you can look for it. So if you've already registered for the free fiveday course, you should have that resource
33:31
accessible. But for now, I'm going to first head off to Behains because that's a huge collection of design work across
33:39
many disciplines. So that would allow me to search my terms and get a lot of things. So I'm going to start searching
33:45
for my keywords and then screenshotting or saving some of the images. And I'm going to head back into my Figma. I'm
33:51
going to open up a new page in Figma that I'm going to call inspiration. And I'm basically going to start pasting the
33:56
images over there. Now, I'm going to keep doing this and I'm going to search for multiple different keywords on
34:02
Behance before I'm moving into my next source, which is Pinterest. And then I might move into something like Dribble
34:08
or maybe awards for great web design references. Now, the amount of time I'll be spending on this stage really depends
34:15
on how much time I have for this project or how much budget the client have. If I'm really tight on time, it might be
34:22
something just like 30 minutes. But on big project, I might spend days collecting references and inspiration.
34:28
One more thing that I'm going to do at this stage is I'm going to go ahead and screenshots all the website that my
34:33
clients gave me as references at the strategy phase. And also, if I have any materials that the client currently
34:39
have, I'm going to add that to my board as well. All right, so let's dive and see what we've got so far and how we're
34:46
moving forward from here. The first thing I want to look at and walk through is what the client actually sent me,
34:52
what they have right now, what they're working with right now, which is this, and some of the websites of competitors
34:58
or other people in similar businesses in this space, and see what they're doing. Now, first of all, let's see what they
35:04
have. Obviously, they have a single color, which is this purplish bluish um color. They have this I don't know if to
35:11
even call this logo because it it I don't think that it is a good logo but they have um kind of like a generic sans
35:18
serif bold font that they're using. Now when I'm looking at the the other
35:24
websites here the reason that I'm looking at it is to see what's working and how they are conveying the story.
35:30
And number two, I want to make sure that I'm not making choices that are too similar uh to other competitors in that
35:36
space so that it doesn't look like we're either ripping them off or that we're people might confuse us with other
35:43
people in this space. Part of the our job as designers is to make sure that the the websites or project that we
35:48
design sets the businesses apart from their competitors. So this is the first one actually looks very nice. They have
35:56
a very a little minimalistic logo. I can say that has these lines that potentially can be something like
36:03
connections in the brain because a lot of what psychedelics do is create connections in the brain. You can also
36:08
see that uh my client has tried to do something with kind of like networks and connections in the brain. So this can be
36:14
a little bit more abstract way to go about this. They have this very premium
36:20
looking font that has small seraps. It looks it looks um I guess beautiful. It's not not a trivial font that you
36:27
would see. looks a little bit kind of like a lifestyle um maybe brand. Beautiful imagery. It does uh look
36:35
trustworthy and a little bit medical I guess you can say. So and and the choices that they have here is the color
36:42
is basically this dark bluish with orange. These are basically the colors that they went through with this gray uh
36:49
background. So this is one. The other one has this kind of like a gradient of
36:55
um teal to purple to to orange. Also has these lines which might be again we can
37:02
see this as a pattern also has the brain. Uh so we can see some recurring patterns here and also I would say a
37:09
generic sanser font. The last one which I actually really like uh they've made
37:14
the the choice not for the logo for the logo they have something that looks like and you can see this from here like how
37:21
molecules look like. So they've used the molecules of psilocybin here to make
37:27
this look a little bit more medical. Um and I guess they use the same shape kind
37:32
of like for the logo. And they have yeah this looks like something from an encyclopedia or something like this. And
37:39
also the the choice of a sarafont can look like something from a medicine book. So this is a really interesting
37:45
approach to how they make this look trustworthy and and um yeah they have these very nice icons that also look
37:52
like something from a textbook like a medical textbook. So this is really nice. Um they're using dark uh dark
38:00
green as their color. So that's also an interesting choice. Now I when I've seen this uh image of their lab that also
38:08
immediately made me think hey maybe my clients need an image in the lab as well. So I've asked them hey do you want
38:13
us to go and take some pictures in your lab and they actually said oh yeah that can be really really helpful to put uh
38:18
an image or something like this in the website. So later on we're going to go ahead and do that we'll also go and take
38:24
a bunch of photos for them. So this is the space in which we're working with. So let's see what I've collected here.
38:30
And I've started collecting things um in the medical space. And you can see that there is a lot um some patterns recur
38:38
such as the use of blue to to give trust and these sans sif uh fonts. Sometimes
38:45
they are they are light. Um sometimes they're using illustrations. Sometimes
38:51
using people. uh we've got this very clear organized typography on bottles on
38:58
medical uh bottles that we can see sometimes we have these product shots of
39:04
if you want to show that it's natural you can show the bottle in kind of like a natural it's in the studio but with
39:10
natural elements around it. So that can be a good um reference to how we're
39:15
going to use photography. Sometimes they're you know photo photographing it in nature. So that can be another
39:22
another nice thing. Here you can see really like a clear there's not much color coming from the brand. We have
39:28
this purplish but most of the visual uh color is coming from the actual um from
39:33
the images. We have 3D renderings of elements. Um now here I dove a little
39:39
bit into looking into psychedelics and psychedelics a lot of times has a lot of crazy colors which is you know not very
39:46
very different from the medical space. Here's another one with uh where they're
39:51
demonstrating the connections, a lot of connections in the brain. We've seen a lot of other companies are uh going into
39:58
this topic of connections um and how to visualize that. So, we've got images of
40:04
mushrooms. What else do we have? Okay, so then I stumbled upon this image which
40:10
is again some kind of a medical I don't know if it's a skin care thing, but some kind of a medical thing. and they're
40:16
using uh I think it's called glass or mirror page um that gives this glassy
40:21
effect to it. Now the interesting thing is that when you're collecting inspiration and I fell upon this image,
40:29
it connected with some of the other things in the topic. So for example, we have these crazy, you know, rainbow
40:36
colors here and here we do have the same rainbow colors. um but they look more
40:42
professional because they are in a medical setting. So that drove me into let's do a little bit of research about
40:48
either rainbow or refractions or something like this. So one thing that I
40:53
want you to take away from this is that sometimes you you fall on an idea that you think might be relevant to the
41:01
project. To me, when I'm looking at this now, the concept, all of a sudden, the concept of a rainbow can be something
41:08
interesting that I can create to hint about all the colors and the dreamy
41:15
effect of psychedelics. But if I can use a rainbow in kind of like these clean
41:20
medical use, I think that can be an interesting and creative solution to the problem of how can you convey the word
41:26
of psychedelics but also put it in a trustworthy medical way. So, I really like this. This gives me a hint of the
41:33
direction I want to go into. I also found this image, which again, not a glass effect. This is I guess some kind
41:39
of a silver foil, but you can see how you can bring in this either glass paper or rainbow effect into a very clean um
41:48
clean area or and that's also a good reference for you know how you might want to uh take photos of the product
41:56
one day in a clear background with some elements. Okay, so this is what I have
42:03
right now. Now the next step is to start narrowing down because obviously we've collected a lot of things and there's a
42:10
lot of ideas here. Not all the colors match. Some some places you can see we've got dark images with light text on
42:17
top of it. Other uh images are very bright. So now is the time to move from
42:23
collection to curation to make the decisions on what I actually want to
42:28
use. Now, um I know I'm running through this very very fast and and branding in
42:34
general and creating mood boards uh is a very very broad topic and we have a lot of content on this topic. If you're in
42:40
the fiveday free course, we're going to send you more resources on it. But for this course, I'm going to keep it really
42:46
really simple. I'm going to open up a new page in Figma and call it mood board. And the first thing I'm going to
42:52
do is I'm going to copy in the images that I'm going to use as reference. So the first thing I told you I really love
42:58
this rainbow effect. So I'm going to take this image and paste it here. The
43:04
other thing that I think is relevant is how they use photography, clean photography with a clean background. So
43:11
I'm going to use that and copy that as well. I'm just going to paste it here. And again, I'm doing this really, really
43:18
simple. There's more intricate ways of doing mood boards, uh, but we're doing the simple thing here. And the last
43:23
thing I want to use is this image which again is very very clean. Has these uh
43:30
cards with round corners almost no color. The color comes from the imagery. So this is something that I can use as a
43:37
reference. Um so that's it just these three images. Now from them I want to
43:42
try and develop basically kind of a color palette and choose font based on
43:49
these. So first of all for the colors you know uh what I can do I can write
43:55
here colors um just so that I have something organized here um very small I
44:01
know but uh so and I'm going to create a rectangular just for the colors that I'm going to use. So obviously looking at
44:08
these references I want black and white. So one thing I can do by hitting I is going to the eyropper and I'm going to
44:15
just select white and then I'm going to duplicate this. And for this one, I'll just going to pick black from here. So,
44:22
I have black and white and maybe some kind of um some kind of gray that I can
44:28
use. So, let's pick this gray that we have here as a reference. So, duplicate
44:33
one more time. Click the eye and use the gray that they have used here. So, now I've got three colors. And also, let's
44:40
let's create this gradient. I'm not sure how I'm going to use this gradient, but let's duplicate this. Let's make this a
44:47
little bit longer. And here from the fill options, I can go ahead and pick a gradient. And you can see basically a
44:54
gradient by default is by between two colors. And I'm going to make it from left to right. Right now, it's from
45:02
basically black to white. And again, I can pick the go and pick the eye picker.
45:08
And let's say we're starting from this um kind of like a purplish color. And
45:14
then afterwards we might have this bluish color. Uh so you can see I'm adding stops to this gradient by just
45:21
hovering on top of this line here. Um and after that maybe going to take this
45:26
green area here. And after that maybe this yellowish.
45:32
And lastly we're going to pick this I guess reddish thing that we have here.
45:38
Okay. So we have kind of like a rainbow gradient. And again, I'm not going to I'm not sure how I'm going to use it.
45:44
Also, I need to be cautious to because we have this competitor that is also
45:50
using a similar gradient and we need to make sure that we're not going to look exactly like this. We have to stand out.
45:56
I'm not sure I'm going to use this gradient much. I actually want to use a rainbow as a concept. But, okay. So,
46:01
we've got a color palette, somewhat of a color palette. Let's think about fonts and type type faces. So here we can see
46:09
kind of like a very very clean sensor font. So let's just so that we have reference. Let's call this typography.
46:17
Um and let's bring in from our wireframe. Let's just basically copy this paragraph uh for a heading and
46:25
bring it here. Uh let's turn it white so we can see what we're doing and bring a
46:32
uh so this is a heading and let's bring also kind of like a paragraph. So let's
46:37
take this paragraph from here. Copy that here. Also turn that white and make it
46:44
align to the left. Okay. So now we've have now we can look at typography and how that looks. Now basically by default
46:51
we're using the font in um which is actually not a bad font. You know it's a good sensor font. It has a lot of
46:58
weights here. You can see it ranges from very very thin to very very bold. And actually maybe the using the light one
47:05
it's actually looking clean. This is a little bit too bold. But actually this font is not very bad. I can actually
47:12
consider it as an option. So to remember what this font is and so that I can compare that I'm going to duplicate
47:17
this. I'm going to call this inter uh actually make this bold. And just so
47:23
that I know okay this is option number one. Okay let's compare it to something. Okay. So one thing I'm going to
47:29
duplicate this. Let's go to Google Fonts. Google Fonts is a a great
47:34
alternative for free fonts. And obviously, if you're just getting started, um that's going to be a good
47:40
option. Now, here I can go ahead and filter them. And in this case, I'm going to filter by sans serif. Just if you're
47:46
not familiar with typography, serif is these small kind of like edges around the uh the font. It looks more literary.
47:54
Um in sans serif, sans in France is without. So, this is without serif. It's just cleaner, right? So, I want to pick
48:01
this one and I need English. I don't need all the other languages. Where is English?
48:07
Where is English? Maybe it's at the top. English or maybe it's Latin. Yeah,
48:13
Latin, I guess, is what it's called. So, now I can go ahead and scroll and look at which one of them. And I'm trying to
48:19
remember I've I've mentioned the question that we're going to ask ourselves. What message does this send?
48:25
Like this font. Um, some of these fonts look a little bit more technical. Some
48:30
of these fonts are more round. Here's this one for example. Raway is actually
48:36
not a bad font. I think it has kind of like geometric roundness and these small
48:41
edges. It might not be a bad option. So, let's give this a try. Now, Google fonts are by default loaded into Figma, which
48:48
is great. So, I should have that if I'm looking here, Raleigh. I have that here
48:53
as it is. And I can choose rally for this one as well. And yeah, I can see whether I want maybe medium for this.
49:02
Um, and just playing around with this and saying, okay, what looks better, this one or this one? Which one I like
49:07
better? Now, uh, Google fonts and free fonts are great. However, if you want to
49:13
create something that looks a little bit more premium and unique and definitely when I was looking at the inspiration
49:19
and looking at, you know, the competitors here, they're using kind of like unique fonts that are probably this
49:26
might be a free font and this might be a free font. This is definitely not a free font. This is a unique and and pretty
49:32
cool uh font. Okay, so the next thing is I'm going to look at paid font
49:38
alternatives. And my favorite one is you work for them, which is a great um place
49:43
for design resources that has a lot of fonts at a very very um reasonable
49:49
prices actually. So I'm going to go here into fonts and I'm going to look at sans serif again. And now again I I'm just
49:58
going to scroll and see, hey, is this a good option? And I might open it up in a tab. And again, as I've mentioned with
50:04
inspiration, this is something that how long you spend on finding the font that works for you really depends on how much
50:12
time you have for this project. It can be 30 minutes and it can be like a week
50:17
of just trying out and comparing uh different type faces and walking around
50:22
here and you know opening up this font and say hm this font is interesting that might look nice. Now when it comes to
50:29
premium font I can't really test it out in Figma. Some some places allow you to download tester font. They do allow type
50:36
tester here. So I can go ahead and I can maybe copy um what we have here maybe
50:42
the first line um developing and providing innovative and I can paste
50:48
that here as a type tester just so I can see let's make it smaller how the text
50:54
looks like and try to make a decision based on that. Now I've already spent a
51:00
little bit more time. I didn't want to waste your time, but I've actually found um a really interesting font here on You
51:06
Work for them that I want to use. It's called Saffron, I think. Um yeah, here
51:12
it is. Saffron Grotesque. I like this font because it has this contrast
51:20
between the the wide part and the thin part. And there's something technical about this, but also something that
51:27
looks a little bit premium. And I like this. So, I went ahead and bought three weights of this. The the light, the
51:33
medium, and uh um light, regular, and medium, I think is
51:39
which one is I bought. These ones cost $20. I think in total it cost me $90 uh
51:44
dollar. I purchased both the the desktop, which allows me to work in Figma and if they will want to print
51:50
business cards and stuff like that, and also the web um license that would allow me to use them on a website. So, let's
51:57
go ahead and see how that looks like. So, I'm going to duplicate a third option. Um, and let's call this saffron.
52:04
Here it is. I already have it inside here. Uh, so let's call this saffron.
52:10
And I think this is the medium is actually a little bit too bold. But I think that when it comes to this and if
52:15
I tighten up the line height just a little bit, uh, it has too too big of a
52:21
space between the line. And again, typography, we can go deep into typography. We've got a lot of content on this. I'm running really fast on uh
52:29
right now. And let's try this Zaffron. You know, when I compare when I look at
52:34
the three options for headlines, I actually think that the saffron is most unique. It's appropriate. Um it sends
52:42
kind of like the right message. Um so I like how that looks. However, it does
52:48
not look good for the body text, for the small text because it has these very
52:53
thin parts in you. you see where the lines connecting and on really small letters that makes it not really
53:00
readable. So I think it's a great uh heading font. It's not really good for
53:05
what we call body type. So I think you know what for this I'm just going to use the intra one which is a very very solid
53:12
sanser font. Um and I think I'm just going to combine them. So I'm going to have a unique heading font and a kind of
53:18
like more regular solid hardworking font for the the body text. So, I'm going to
53:23
duplicate this. Um, and yeah, I think I'm going to run with these. So, again,
53:29
what I wanted to show you is how I collect and compare options that I have here. And as I said, in real projects
53:36
where I would spend time on this, I might compare 10, 15, maybe 20 options to look and make a decision between
53:42
them. How much time you have for this uh depends on you. But for now, I've made my decision. So, I'm going to run with
53:48
these. Okay. So, note what we have so far. We've got type faces and font
53:55
choices that we can use in our website. We've got colors to use in our website. We are missing one thing which is a
54:01
logo, right? So, if I'm going to go back into what they have, they have this as a
54:07
logo. Um, I don't think it looks good. This definitely would not work in small
54:12
spaces and I don't think it's really great. Now, again, logos, huge topic. We
54:18
can learn a lot about uh logos. We have a full-on branding course. I'm not going to dive deep into logos, but I'll tell
54:24
you what I what I thought. I thought about how can we convey the connections
54:29
here and maybe try to yeah try to use use the concept that they used, which is
54:34
connections and a brain, but try to make it in a more abstract way that would look as a shape. And I also liked this
54:40
reference of kind of like thin lines and these oval shapes. And I was like, I'm going to try to play around with these.
54:47
So, I jumped into Illustrator. And again, I'm not diving too much into this, but Illustrator has this really
54:52
really cool uh effect or a tool that is called blend that allowed me to
54:57
basically take three two shapes. Um, let me see. It was kind of like an oval.
55:03
Basically take one oval and then copy and paste um and do another oval that
55:09
looks basically like this or something like this and connect them and create all the intervals between them. So that
55:16
is again I don't think it's an amazing logo but for this case it looks kind of like an abstract shape of a brain with a
55:23
lot of potentially connections between them. So I'm going to try to run with this. So I'm going to copy it into my
55:30
Figma file. Let's go back here. And again this is really not how long you should spend uh on doing a logo but I
55:38
just want to have something quick that we can work with. So, I'm going to paste this uh I guess we can call it uh shape
55:46
of a logo in here. And let's go ahead and
55:52
try to create some kind of a typography to go alongside it. Um so, let's go
55:58
ahead and make the text black. And uh where are we? I'm going to try to bring
56:03
this on top. Okay. So, the name of the company is Massex. Ma mass six. Okay, let's make this
56:13
bigger. Um, massics. And I think we can we can
56:18
make this a little bolder or maybe the regular. And maybe we'll use the pharma.
56:25
Uh, but not uppercase. So, I'm going to change the case here. Yeah, I think this
56:31
this combination can work. And maybe this needs to be a little bit bolder. And actually on the on a on the web, we
56:39
need a composition that is vertical, right? Because we don't want a huge um
56:45
we don't want a huge rectangular shape for the website. So it's better to have in the navigation something that is
56:51
vertical. So I think maybe we can use something like this.
56:57
Maybe we need to make this bigger so that they're the same line height. Is this bold? This is bold.
57:05
And this is regular or maybe light. Uh maybe regular. And this we can make it I
57:11
guess smaller. But maybe make the lines a little bit bigger. A little bit. We
57:19
can choose all the circles from here. And make the stroke a little bolder.
57:24
Okay. Again, don't think it's an amazing logo. This was done too fast, but it is
57:31
something that we can work with. It looks solid. It looks legit. Definitely looks better than, you know, what we had
57:39
uh originally, which we couldn't really work with. So, I think I'm going to work with these. Okay. So, now we basically
57:48
have the toolkit for the design of our website. We've got a logo, we've got colors, and we've got typography. The
57:54
next step is to think about imagery. What kind of images are we going to have
57:59
as assets to use in our design? When it comes to creating images, we basically have three options. The first option is
58:06
to create something custommade for this website. So for example, we can create custom photography either by taking
58:13
photographs ourselves or working with a professional photographer. We can hire an illustrator or again if we know how
58:18
to illustrate, we can create custom illustration or custom 3D work or of course we can hire some kind of an
58:24
artist. The second option is to work with readymade assets. So there are a lot of stock photography or stock
58:32
illustration websites. Some of them are premium that you can buy photos from professional website for relatively
58:38
cheap price. Obviously much cheaper than hiring a professional photographer or the same with illustration. You can buy
58:45
illustrations uh which is cheaper than hiring a custom illustrator. Uh and there's also a lot of website that gives
58:52
you free ready-made assets. So free stock photographer uh see three free
58:57
stock photography or free illustrations or free icons. So there are a lot of free resources these days on the
59:04
internet and again if you're on the free 5-day course we're going to send you a list of tons of resources. The third
59:09
option, which is actually quite new, is to use AI to generate your assets, which
59:15
is a really, really interesting new option that we have for us that wasn't available until recently, but now opens
59:21
up a whole can of possibilities for us to basically create something custom, but it's way cheaper than obviously
59:29
hiring a professional illustrator, 3D artist, photographer, whatever. Okay, in this project, we're actually going to
59:35
try and use all of these three methods so that you can see how all of them work. So, let's start off by thinking
59:42
coming up with the concepts of what we need for this website. To do that, I'm going to head back into my wireframes
59:48
and take a look at every place where I basically said, "Okay, we're going to need an image here." And this is really
59:53
the fun creative part of the process. You basically need to come up with ideas. Okay? And you can use keywords,
1:00:00
you can use brainstorming, but this is really where your creativity can shine and you can come up with ideas. So,
1:00:07
first image and one of the most important images on the website is what we're going to have in the hero section,
1:00:12
right? And I'm trying to figure out again, we don't have an actual product to shoot. Um, so we have to come up with
1:00:18
something imaginative, right? And we need to talk about again, we have references to what other competitors
1:00:24
done. So here they're showing somebody walking on the beach kind of like talking I guess about mental health.
1:00:30
Here they're showing somebody just somebody I guess I don't know if to say tripping but kind of like blissful
1:00:36
experience with an abstract perhaps connection or what's going through their head. Here they're showing an
1:00:42
illustration of mushrooms. So these are examples of their creative ideas. And I'm looking at here and I'm also trying
1:00:48
to think what's unique about this company. How can we tell their story in a unique way? Okay. So, what's unique
1:00:54
here? Here, I think what they're trying to focus on and the reason that they tell me to include it in the headline is
1:01:00
that number one, it's naturally sourced, meaning it's not uh I guess you can
1:01:05
manufacture silos, the the hallucinating effect in magic mushroom. You can
1:01:10
manufacture that in a lab, but there are benefits for it to being naturally sourced, meaning like grown out of
1:01:16
actual mushrooms. So, that's a one point, the fact that it's naturally sourced. The other thing is GMP which I
1:01:22
think stands for good manufacturing process which basically means that it's it's in a a medical quality a good
1:01:28
medical quantity it's standardized right it's because there's a challenge when you're making things natural you where
1:01:35
you're growing stuff every time it's a little bit different and when you try to standardize something that is naturally
1:01:40
sourced there's a challenge here to make it in a magical medical quality standardized so I think that the
1:01:46
combination between naturally sourced and GMP P and the like the standard is
1:01:51
where their uniqueness comes into play and I'm trying to think how can I visualize this. So I had two ideas for
1:01:59
something that we can visualize. Number one is we can show maybe like these
1:02:05
little medical bottles kind of like going through the horizon like a lot of
1:02:10
them to hint at the you know the fact that it's there's a manufacturing
1:02:15
process here. to kind of like look like a manufacturing like a production line. But again, maybe bring in a little bit
1:02:22
of rainbow or something like this. Try to try to create a very clean image like
1:02:27
we have here of this medical bottle. Create a manufacturing line stretching
1:02:33
into the horizon with kind of like a rainbow light or rainbow refraction or something like this. So this is idea
1:02:39
number one that I have. And idea number two is perhaps create try to create an image just like this of what we call
1:02:46
sometimes pack shot like the the shot of a product shot of the actual product but
1:02:51
try to bring in this nature into it. And you can see reference here where it's kind of like there's leaves and you can
1:02:59
see a little bit of nature coming into play. So maybe try to go with something like this where you see the bottle and
1:03:04
there's mushrooms growing and maybe also a rainbow. Again, rainbow is kind of like the brand motif that I want to
1:03:11
bring in. So, white, very clean with kind of like a rainbow effect. So, these are two ideas that I have in mind. And I
1:03:19
think these would be a great place to try to work with an AI image making
1:03:24
obviously because I don't have the budget to hire a real photographer at this point. And also, these sounds like
1:03:30
very complicated things to shoot in real life. So, I'm going to use MidJourney to
1:03:35
try and generate them. And I'm going to show you. I've already done this, but I want to show you my thinking process because this took a lot of iteration and
1:03:42
playing around. So, I started by writing a production line of medical glass bottle stretching into the horizon in
1:03:48
white limbo. And this is basically some of the images that I got. And that's not
1:03:55
exactly what I had in mind. This looks a little bit too much uh factory and
1:04:01
product line. And that's not really what I want. So then I felt I I tried to uh
1:04:07
do variations on this. So I created a variation of this and now I starting to play around with them. So now I've tried
1:04:14
okay maybe make it look a little bit premium. So premium medical glass by stretching into the horizon in white
1:04:20
limbo rainbow reflection. And now we're starting to get stuff that is a little
1:04:25
bit more interesting with these glassy or rainbowy effect coming into this. So
1:04:31
again I'm trying different wording. I'm trying to figure out what maybe these small bottles are look like. I want them
1:04:38
to have a metal cap. So, I'm adding metal cap into the uh prompt. And I'm
1:04:43
just going to try this multiple times and create a lot of variations until I'm going to figure out what I want. And
1:04:50
this is a lot again, a lot of iterations to figure out what you want. But we're starting to get some cool stuff in here.
1:04:57
stuff that I think potentially I can use um especially around these types of
1:05:03
options where it's very very clean. I'm also I have in mind the fact that we need to have a place for the text and we
1:05:10
need to figure out you know what composition we're going to use here. So this image right here is something that
1:05:15
potentially can really work. So I'm good with this. I'm going to try and explore
1:05:21
my other concept. So for this other concept, I wrote a product shot of a single medical uh feel, which is I guess
1:05:29
I I realize how these little bubbles are called. Standing on a small rock in a white limbo. There are a couple of Now I
1:05:35
try to figure out what the name of the mushroom is. And by the way, specifically in MidJourney, you can't
1:05:41
write magic mushroom because it's whatever the prompt won't work. And there's of course a lot of types of ma
1:05:48
magic mushroom. So you want to fit to exactly the type of mushroom that you need. And these starting to become these
1:05:55
are interesting. Uh they look beautiful. Again, I want to bring in also the uh
1:06:01
rainbow effect into this because this is part of um what I'm what I'm liking
1:06:07
here. So I tried a lot of prompts and here's one. Now we're getting somewhere where I think, oh, this is interesting
1:06:14
with the rainbow in the background. You can see the bottle. You can see a little bit grass here. Now, I like the the fact
1:06:21
that it's natury, right? I wanted to talk about nature. So, I want to bring in I want to try to combine the story of
1:06:27
a lab, very very clean lab, good manufacturing standards, and the fact that it's natural. So, how do you bring
1:06:34
nature into the lab, but also combine it with uh a little bit of this rainbow uh
1:06:39
to tell the story? Okay. Once I find images that I like, I'm starting to upscale them, which is creating a higher
1:06:46
resolution images of, you know, uh, these images so I can go ahead and uh,
1:06:51
try and work with them. And as you can see here, I'm trying a lot of variations. I'm trying to change the
1:06:57
wording. Maybe it's not a rainbow light. Maybe it's a rainbow refraction. Um,
1:07:03
maybe I'm need to change, you know, if the mushroom is from under the rock or next to the rock. I'm playing around
1:07:08
with the wording a lot. Um, and I'm coming up with with some pretty cool
1:07:14
stuff here. Okay, so this is the first images that I'm going to try and work with. Um, that was the first thing.
1:07:22
Okay, let's see what we have next. The next thing here is that we have this mission uh statement here. And here
1:07:28
we're talking about you know uh the uh revolutionize the global mental health
1:07:34
care uh harness the power of naturally source creating innovative product address the world's health challenges.
1:07:41
So here I created again image in the background. It might not be an image in the background. Maybe it's next to
1:07:46
something, but I want to have a large image. And one thing that I thought about trying to show how the product is
1:07:54
going to be actually used in a medical in a medical context, right? So the way
1:08:00
that the the treatment is going to work is that people are going to come in for a treatment in kind of like a lab.
1:08:05
They're going to sit down. and it's going to be monitored by a professional where they're going to take, you know, the medicine and it's going to be
1:08:11
guided. So, here I had an idea of saying, let's show somebody
1:08:16
going through the process. So, they're in a lab, they're they're lying down on a bed, they're closing their eyes, and
1:08:22
they're dreaming. So, we're going to use this rainbow light again to kind of like visualize the the psychedelic
1:08:27
experience. So here I basically wrote a closeup of a man lying down on a lab
1:08:34
bed, eyes closed, blissful smile, rainbow light. The man is dressed in
1:08:39
white, clean white room. And honestly, in this case, I actually loved the first
1:08:46
thing that came up was actually it's, you know, mid journey is just amazing. But I really like the first option. The
1:08:52
first option is just I feel like it's so good. It's very, very clean. So we can try to make it just like white and the
1:08:59
colorful rainbow. The man looks good. It looks he looks blissful. Um so I just I
1:09:06
really really love this image. Okay, so I've got my first two images. Now here
1:09:12
we have a section where they're actually talking about the product. And here I was basically inspired by you know we
1:09:19
saw here in the other website where they had photographs taken inside of the lab
1:09:24
of the process. So in this case, I suggested to them, hey, do you do you want me to come in and take photos in
1:09:31
your lab just so that we can have something like this? Because again, they brought in this as a reference for a good website. And I basically asked
1:09:37
them, would you like us to have something like this where we show you in the lab working or something like this?
1:09:42
And they said, "Yes, that's actually a great idea." So I went into their lab. I
1:09:48
brought in my uh camera. And you know, I have a DSLR camera, a nice camera, but that's okay. If I didn't have this, I
1:09:54
could even go with my iPhone and try to take photos. Um, or of course, if there's a budget to bring in a
1:10:00
professional photographer or if there's a photographer friend that you can ask for help. We decided we're going to go and do custom photography for this uh
1:10:08
section here. Um, so for this, let's go here. So again, the context is I want to
1:10:15
bring in one or maybe multiple images of them in the lab and how things look
1:10:21
like. perhaps even kind of like a short video. Okay, so I went in there and now
1:10:26
I'm opening up Adobe Bridge and Adobe Bridge is basically a software for photographers to review photographs.
1:10:32
It's not mandatory. It's just make things easier for me. You don't have to have this obviously if you're working with photographs. It basically helps you
1:10:40
run through a lot of photographs where you can see the photos and you can, you know, make them bigger, make them
1:10:45
smaller, you can rank them, uh, and it's going to help you, um, sort which one you want to work with. So, here are, you
1:10:52
know, I've got a lot of Petra dish photos where they're looking at it. Uh, we basically took a lot of photos. Uh
1:11:00
then we've got like some of the processing of how they're distilling uh
1:11:05
it and turning it into basically kind of a like a processed liquid. So we've got
1:11:10
a bunch of these photos. Um to do what else do we have? So we we took a lot of
1:11:17
photos as you can see here. We took some photos of the actually growing of the mushroom and actually harvesting
1:11:24
checking the the mushrooms. we've got here and basically did a little bit of
1:11:29
harvesting, cutting them. Now, I also took some uh videos because I thought maybe I'm going to create a short video,
1:11:34
but I didn't have time to actually do that. Um, so I'm just looking at the
1:11:39
images. Uh, and then there's here's images of him showing me the mushroom.
1:11:44
These are some of the mushrooms after they've been dried. So, we've got a bunch of stuff to work with here. So,
1:11:52
the nice thing about this is, as I've mentioned, it allows you to rank them. So, I've basically ranked here. Here are
1:11:58
some of the photos that I like best, just so that we have a little bit of a smaller uh selection to work with. And I
1:12:05
think because I have a bunch of photos here that maybe I want to use, maybe this can be looking back at the section
1:12:11
that we have here. Um, maybe this can be kind of like a gallery or maybe like a bento box with showing multiple images
1:12:19
um in a grid. That can be an interesting way to show multiple photos just because we have a bunch of them in this area.
1:12:25
Okay, so I've got these images and we're going to be able to use them here. Next,
1:12:32
we have partner logos and that's just logos that I've asked them to submit.
1:12:37
So, that's great. And the last thing that I looking here at here, I actually
1:12:43
decided I I don't want to bring in an extra image here. I'm just going to work with the contact form. However, we have
1:12:50
um basically um investor and we need an email us button. So, this can be a nice
1:12:56
place to start bringing in an email icon, right? And this is going to be a good place to look for free email icons.
1:13:04
Uh I'm going to use icon finder, which is a good place for both free and premium icons that I like to use. Um and
1:13:12
basically, it's very very simple, right? Email icon. It's something very simple. I'm just going to search for email. Um,
1:13:18
and I can go ahead and select here free because I'm looking for something free.
1:13:23
I'm also I can pick the style. In this case, I'm going to pick outline because that's probably the most relevant style
1:13:31
um for us. And actually, the first one is probably not a bad solution for an
1:13:36
email icon. And we can use that. I can go ahead and download this as an SVG, which is a vector file, meaning, you
1:13:42
know, we can scale it how much we want. I can even just copy it to uh Figma. So,
1:13:48
I'm going to wait and later when we're going to use it, I'm just going to um copy that into my clipboard and paste it
1:13:55
in Figma. Okay. So, at this point, I have pretty much the assets that I want
1:14:01
to use in the design. Now, we can start going ahead and putting it all together,
1:14:06
putting the colors, putting the imagery, and trying to make this look good. Let's do that. So, I'm going to go ahead and
1:14:11
open up a new page here, which I'm going to call design design. I'm actually going to put it last
1:14:18
so that our pages are based on our process. And I'm going to copy the page.
1:14:24
I'm going to hold the whole page of the wireframe and I'm going to paste it in the design. I don't want to ruin the
1:14:29
wireframe so that we have a copy of how it looked before and after. And let's just start working on this file. So,
1:14:37
first thing I want to do is I want to bring in the logo. So, let's go here and copy the somewhat of a logo that we have
1:14:46
here. Actually, I'm going to have to turn this from text to actual lines so
1:14:51
that we can scale it all. So, I'm going to do outline stroke and then outline
1:14:56
stroke. Basically, what that does is, as you can see right here on the left, it turned each letter into just a vector
1:15:03
shape. So, now I can go ahead and scale them. So, I'm going to select all of them together. I'm going to group them
1:15:09
as a logo. Actually, we can call this double click and call this a logo. And then we can copy this and go into our
1:15:16
design. And instead of this, I'm going to paste this. And I need to hold my shift key so that I can scale it down
1:15:22
proportionally. Now, what's happening here is that the uh line stroke of the
1:15:28
icon still remains very very uh has the same basically outline. So, it looks too
1:15:34
bold. So, I'm just going to select these vectors. And you can see here I can drop
1:15:39
the outline to maybe one. Maybe one and a half.
1:15:45
Let's see how that looks. Okay, one and a half looks good. Okay, so I have my logo here. That's great. So, what else?
1:15:52
We've decided we want basically to have three links here. And these links are basically going to scroll us down. So,
1:15:57
if I click mission, it's going to scroll us down to this. Product is going to scroll us down to this. and contact is
1:16:04
going to scroll us all the way to um to the back. So, what do we have here? By
1:16:10
default, these are inter, which is good. This that's what we wanted. Trying to figure out whether I actually want this
1:16:15
semi-bold or maybe we need this uh regular or medium. I think medium is
1:16:22
actually look looking good. Now, one thing I'm going to start doing is creating text styles inside of Figma.
1:16:28
And you'll see how that looks like. So, for example, I'm going to click here on the styles and I'm going to add a new style and I'm going to call this nav
1:16:35
link. The what this does is now I can just pick these two and I'm going to go
1:16:42
ahead and select the nav link and the same styles the size and the width of the font are going to be applied to
1:16:48
this. So, if I want to make a change later on, I can just globally change all of them instead of having to change
1:16:53
three things in a row. This is also going to help us when we're going to develop to have clear styles. So, the
1:16:59
next thing I want to do is I want to make sure that these are aligned. I basically want to make sure that we're going to have all the content is going
1:17:05
to be aligned from the left and to the right. Um, and we're going to have kind of like equal spacing. So, I just trying
1:17:13
to make sure that we have equal spacing from the top and from the right. And same thing here. And that these three
1:17:20
elements basically are going to be equally spaced. So, I'm going to use this um distribute horizontal spacing.
1:17:28
Now, they're equally spaced. That's great. So, now I can just select this whole thing, this whole group, and I'm
1:17:34
going to group it. And I'm going to call this navbar. So, if I want to then move it all
1:17:40
together, I can just select this navbar and it's a whole group. Let's apply the text styles to these headings. So, here
1:17:48
we know we want to use saffron. So, I'm changing this to saffron. Now, this is the uh main heading of the page. All
1:17:56
right. In in web design, we call this H1, heading number one. It's the we only have one of these. This is kind of like
1:18:01
the name of the book or something like this, right? So, it's going to be probably the biggest, usually the
1:18:07
biggest uh and most important one. So, let's turn this into, I don't know, 55.
1:18:13
Um, let's see how that looks like. 55, maybe 50. I'm just going to play around
1:18:19
with it. Uh, this looks okay. I don't like to have this dash in the middle.
1:18:25
So, I'm going to remove the dash. I hope they're not going to be mad at me. I also think at this point there is too
1:18:32
much space between the lines that they actually look like three different paragraphs. So, I'm going to change the
1:18:38
line height from auto. I'm actually going to just click down arrow to just start bringing it down a little bit. And
1:18:45
now, I think it actually looks better this way. Okay. Now, although this is only going to be used once, I do want to
1:18:52
create a text style for this again for uh organizational purposes when we're going to go ahead and develop this. I'm
1:18:57
going to call this H1. Uh and this is great. This is a subheading and this is
1:19:03
we will be reusing this. So, we're going to be using here and here uh and here.
1:19:08
So, we have this kind of like subheading again and again. And for this, I want enter semi bold. That's okay. Um what's
1:19:16
the size of this by the way? What's the text size of this? The text size, this is 18. You know what? I actually think I
1:19:23
want this to be 16. So, let's turn this into 16. And as you can see, all of them
1:19:28
have been changed to 16. And that's I think that actually looks better. 18 is a little bit big. Uh, this one, this can
1:19:35
actually be 18. This I I do want this to be all caps. I think it'll look stronger. So, I can click this three
1:19:41
dots here, and you can see we have cases. And we can change this from uh title case which is just the first
1:19:47
letter in every word or just uppercase. I think this looks good. So enter
1:19:53
semibold 18 uppercase. That's not bad for this. Uh so let's create a text style for this and call this subheading
1:20:01
or top heading whatever. Let's call this subheading. Created style. Okay. So we've got these
1:20:08
spacing should be a little bit more tighter. so that we've got equal spacing between all of these. Um, and maybe
1:20:14
we're going to just move this to center it around the image. I think this looks good. Okay, same thing. Now, here we
1:20:22
already have a text style for this. So, I can just pick it up from here. That's great. Um, for this one, this a body
1:20:28
text and that's also going to be reused here and here and here. So, for this, I
1:20:34
think semi bold is too bold. Let's turn this into regular. And I think here 16 is going to be good as well. That
1:20:40
actually looks good. So let's create a new text style and call this body. Body is how we call the main paragraphs. Um,
1:20:47
and this one is similar to this one, but a little bit smaller, right? So if this
1:20:53
one was 50, this is probably going to be maybe 40. So let's change this to saffron. Um, yeah, 40. Maybe even 42 or
1:21:02
something a little bit. I want to make sure that there's contrast in the size between this and the other elements that
1:21:09
we have here on the page. Um, so this looks this looks pretty good. Uh, let's
1:21:14
create a new text style here. That's going to be H2. So H2 is kind of like if if this was the name of the book. H2 is
1:21:21
the name of each chapter. Each section is kind of like a chapter. So this is H2. This is H2. I can already start
1:21:28
applying H2 to this and H2 to this. Now
1:21:33
I can already see that here in the mission we had one line so I didn't address the line height but here that
1:21:40
line height looks way too big for me and also
1:21:45
I want this to be sentence case meaning usually when you have headlines the first letter in every word is being
1:21:52
capitalized. So I do want to edit this text style. So I'm going to choose it and I'm going to go to these properties
1:21:57
just to edit it. And for the line height, I'm going to tighten it up a little bit. And I'm going to also click
1:22:04
these three dots and select title case. Okay. So now you can see every letter is
1:22:09
capitalized. And it looks much better for headlines. Okay. So we've got this.
1:22:15
We've got all of these. Let's go ahead and center them so they they look centered. Um,
1:22:22
however, there's something here that I don't like, which is a long line, short line, and then a longer line. And again,
1:22:28
it somehow creates like a weird composition. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to remove the word
1:22:33
introducing and just leave a new area of medicine. I hope they're not mad at me, but I'm going to take this editing uh
1:22:40
liberty here to because now it's kind of like it's growing. It's I I think it looks like a better composition. New
1:22:46
area of medicine mass mission. Uh it's centered. I can select all of them to
1:22:51
make sure that they are centered. I can also select the the whole section background and make sure they are
1:22:57
centered in this whole page. Okay, this looks good. So, we've got the type figured out for this. At this point, we
1:23:03
already have styles for everything. So, I'm just going to apply, you know, subheading for this. This has already
1:23:08
been applied. This needs to be body. So, very very easy. Something in the lines
1:23:14
here does not work well. For some reason, it just breaks line where it shouldn't. And also I'm going to add a
1:23:21
dot at the end of the sentence because that's that's how we write, right? So know that sometimes I'm doing a little
1:23:27
bit of text editing uh just to make sure that probably I'm going to add a dot to
1:23:33
this end of the sentence as well. Um just to make it look better, I'm going
1:23:38
to tighten the spacing here. Okay, so that's okay. I'm also going to center
1:23:44
this around this image. Partners, actually our partners is also H2. So
1:23:49
let's apply H2 here. That's basically the name of the section. I'm going to center it to the page and then contact
1:23:56
us. It's already been applied. Now we have here um so two things. Number one, I said I
1:24:03
don't want an image here. I'm actually I want this I want to have this investor contact as an heading, but it's not it's
1:24:12
basically a subheading of this contact assets. Let's call it H3. So for this I still want to use saffron but a little
1:24:20
bit smaller. So if this was 40 maybe this is uh 35 a little bit smaller than
1:24:25
this. Yeah something like this. I'm going to make sure that it's align maybe to
1:24:31
you know the second column that we have here. So we've and also I want to make
1:24:36
sure that these two lines align right and they're they need to align to the bottom of the text. We call this
1:24:43
baseline um baseline alignment. So this looks good. They're they're aligned.
1:24:50
This is here. Email us. I'm going to replace the email as with an icon. And we're going to do this later. Uh and
1:24:57
this is basically I want this to look like some kind of a link. So for this, it's very unique. So I'm not going to
1:25:03
create a text style for this. But maybe I'm just going to make it bigger. Maybe like 25.
1:25:09
Uh regular. I do want to create an underline for this. So from the text decoration, I'm going to add an
1:25:15
underline. So this looks like a link that people can click. And we're going
1:25:20
to bring in some kind. I'm going to do this maybe like a circle or something.
1:25:26
Oval. So I'm clicking O for oval, which I can also pick from here. And just do something like this where we can add the
1:25:33
icon later on. Maybe something like this. Okay.
1:25:39
Okay. in here. We're going to also redesign this form a little bit later.
1:25:44
Um, but for now, let's just say that these don't need to be semi-bold. They're also
1:25:51
not Yeah, maybe. You know what? Maybe we can use body for this. Uh, so let's
1:25:57
let's apply body to them and see if that looks okay. Yeah, it does look okay. The the the button should probably look
1:26:04
different. So, maybe it needs to be an uppercase kind of like submit or something like this. So the button needs
1:26:10
to be, you know, looking a little bit different. Okay, this is great. The last thing we've got this and this is really
1:26:16
kind of like copyrights. I can make body here as well, but actually sometimes this is even smaller than a body. So
1:26:23
this can be sometimes 14 or something very small, not semi-bold, regular, and
1:26:30
just center it. So yeah, that looks okay. Maybe left
1:26:35
align. We can also test left align here. to this. H let's keep it centered. Okay.
1:26:43
So, we did the first first step which is basically setting up the properties for the type. Now, the next thing I want to
1:26:50
do is to create the layout. Now, I can go ahead and experiment. But in this case, because I have this I have my
1:26:56
inspiration here from these, you know, cards that have round corners and I I want to do use this this kind of layout
1:27:04
like we have in our inspiration. So, I'm going to head back and let's go ahead and just give this some round corners.
1:27:10
And you can do this right here from this round corner property. Let's try 25.
1:27:16
And again, this is basically experimenting. Do we want 30? Do we want more round corners or less round
1:27:23
corners? This actually I think it looks good this way with that is 30. Okay, so
1:27:29
that looks good. Let's also make this next section a card. So, I want to make sure that it aligns so that there's
1:27:36
similar spacing. Um, and let's make sure that it's align
1:27:42
on this edge as well. So, something like this. And let's give this also 30 pixels
1:27:49
of round corners. Okay. So, we've got these sections. Nice. Now here I've
1:27:55
mentioned that I want to create kind of maybe like a bento box or some kind of a
1:28:01
gallery so that I can use multiple multiple photos. First of all, let's give this 30 pixels of round corners. So
1:28:07
what I'm going to do is I'm just going to let's make one f one photo is going to be horizontal. And let's duplicate
1:28:14
this by dragging it while holding the alt or option key. And maybe make something like this.
1:28:22
Um, yeah, but I do want them to have more
1:28:27
space between them. Spacing that looks a little bit similar to what we have here. So, consistent spacing is something that
1:28:33
you really want to think about. Okay. So, now they are aligned. They have
1:28:39
somewhat of an equal spacing. Um, actually everything is a little too
1:28:44
tight, but I can bring in the contact form a little bit down. And I can bring
1:28:51
in the partners. Okay. So now it's spaced. It's better spaced. Okay. So I've got
1:28:58
these things. I could probably also give 30 pixels of round corners to the form.
1:29:04
That looks nicer. Also to the button. That looks nice. Maybe I can make the
1:29:10
button a little bit bigger. And you can play around with this. Uh
1:29:15
there's no rules for this specifically, but okay. So, we're good. I think we're
1:29:24
we're heading in the right direction. Okay, let's start to bring in the
1:29:29
imagery. Okay, so I've saved up my images right here in this folder. And
1:29:36
the first image that we have is I've selected this image as the main hero image to work with. Now, I can start
1:29:42
dragging it inside. But one thing that I want to show you is I can hit copy, command C or control C. And when I'm
1:29:49
holding this element, I'm just going to hit commandV paste. And it's basically going to paste it inside this element
1:29:55
already with the round corners. And this looks actually pretty good. It looks
1:30:01
pretty good as it is. So this is nice. Okay, let's continue. For this one, we
1:30:07
have this image of the person lying in the bed. So I'm going to try and do the same thing. I'm going to hit copy. Hold
1:30:14
this. I'm going to paste it. Now, I have a few problems.
1:30:19
Um, so here's my problems. Number one, the text is on his face. Always always a
1:30:25
big no no. Text on face. You don't want to do this. So, I want to bring him
1:30:30
down. That's that's one thing. So, let's select this rectangular. And right here,
1:30:36
you can see that the image is being used in the fill here. And by clicking on edit, I can open it up. And I can change
1:30:41
from fill to crop. And that allows me to kind of like move the image inside of
1:30:47
basically the mask or the container. So I think actually what I really want is
1:30:52
to make him smaller, bring him down a little bit. I think this would be much
1:30:58
better proportions. Okay. So what I'm realizing right now is the image is not
1:31:04
big enough. we actually need to create or fill in all of this missing information which we're going to do. The
1:31:10
other problem that I'm seeing when I'm seeing these two images next to each other, I can see that this one is much
1:31:17
more bluish or grayish and what we called in colors. This is much colder and this is much warmer, right? The the
1:31:24
light is yellow. So, this looks a little bit more yellow or greenish. And I want them to be, you know, so that the brand
1:31:31
looks the same and looks consistent. I want us to bring this down and change the color to match the first image. So,
1:31:39
now we've got a little bit of uh editing, photo editing to do so that we can go ahead and fix this. Okay, I'm
1:31:45
going to undo this. But, so I'm going to need to take this uh image into
1:31:52
Photoshop or some other software editing company. Um, image editing software is
1:31:58
what I meant. Uh, let me drag this into Photoshop. Okay, so here's our image
1:32:04
inside of Photoshop. Now, the first thing I want to do is I want to create
1:32:09
some extra space so we can scale it down. What I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate this image by hitting
1:32:15
command J. And you can see that I've created another layer. And the reason is I'm going to hit C to get into the crop
1:32:21
tool. And I'm basically going to add area here and add some area here and add
1:32:28
some area here. So, this is I need all of this extra image. Okay. And Photoshop
1:32:34
using AI is going to help me fill in this thing. Okay. So, I've changed the crop. Right now, it's all black. So,
1:32:41
that doesn't help me out a lot. So, I'm going to take the marquee tool here and I'm going to select all of the space
1:32:48
where I need to generate new things. So, I'm selecting this. Now, by holding shift, I'm adding more space here at the
1:32:55
top. And by holding shift, I'm holding adding more stuff. So, I've basically
1:33:02
selected all of this area here. And you can see from this bar that I have here, I've got generative fill. So, I'm going
1:33:08
to hit that. I don't need to describe anything. I'm just going to hit generate. Because if I don't describe anything, it's just going to try to
1:33:14
figure out on their own what what should be there based on the image, based on
1:33:19
the other area that wasn't selected, which is basically the image. So, let's see what's happening. This is always
1:33:25
exciting whether this would work, whether this would not work. But I think that this photo is kind of like easy
1:33:31
because it's very clean. It just needs to add kind of like clean wall and the bed. And that actually looks fantastic.
1:33:38
You know, it gives us three options with a blanket or with but they all look
1:33:43
great. Actually, the first one looks fantastic. So, this is really, really great. Okay. So, first thing, the crop
1:33:50
thing is now figured out. Now I basically want to bring in so let me open up this image also in Photoshop
1:33:57
just so that I can look at you know look at them side by side
1:34:03
okay I can open it up here in this one let's make it smaller so I can look it okay now I need to change the colors of
1:34:10
this image so here's what I'm going to do and again this is some a little bit more advanced Photoshop stuff is a huge
1:34:17
topic we've got a course on that as well um right here in YouTube for free So,
1:34:22
what I'm going to do is right here from my layers panel when I'm selecting this image, I actually have here. Let's see
1:34:29
what we have. We've got I think what we want to use is photo filter. Okay. So,
1:34:36
I've added a photo filter. And here's what it looks like when I'm selecting it. I basically have here warming filter
1:34:43
and I've got cooling filters. So, when I'm selecting a cooling filter, note what it did. It made this image. And I'm
1:34:50
going to turn this on and off so you can see how it took it from a warm photo and turned it into a cooler photo which is
1:34:57
much more aligned with this. Let's try to experiment with the other filters. Uh, this looks a little bit bad. Uh, has
1:35:05
more red in it. This one has a little bit more green in it. Actually, the first one was actually the best for us.
1:35:11
So, I think this looks good. One more thing that I think I want to do is I I just want to brighten up this whole
1:35:17
image so that it's kind of like whiter and more exposed. So for this I'm going to right here from the adjustment layers
1:35:25
I'm going to add curves. That's going to give me this graph which is basically the distribution between the blacks and
1:35:30
the whites in this image. You can see a lot of it is in the middle. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to pull this graph up which is basically going
1:35:38
to redistribute some of these grays into more white areas. And you can see what
1:35:44
it does to the photo. It brightens up. It brightens it up a lot. Uh sometimes
1:35:50
it's a little bit too bright. So you can bring this down a little bit to create more contrast. But actually, you know
1:35:56
what? I don't want this more contrast. I actually like that it's really really bright. So look at what we have right
1:36:02
now. This filter, this adjustment layer makes the photo much brighter. This adjustment layer changes the color,
1:36:08
adjusts the color from yellow to cool. And now now these photos actually match
1:36:13
in the tone in the style in the kind of like vibe you can say. So I'm really
1:36:18
really happy with where we are right now. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select this whole image.
1:36:24
Command A. Select everything. And I'm going to do copy merge. It's going to merge all of these layers into an image.
1:36:30
And I'm just going to go back here and hit paste here. Bam. Okay. That looks so
1:36:37
much better. That looks so much better. I can still bring this up a little bit higher.
1:36:42
Uh but already it looks Yeah, it just looks so much better. Okay, already it's
1:36:47
starting to look good. I'm happy with this. Okay, next. Okay, so now we have this area where we want to bring in some
1:36:54
of the images that we took. So, let's jump right back into Bridge and decide
1:37:01
what images are we going to bring in. So, first one, I think this one. It's a
1:37:06
little bit dark so it's hard to see but this is a good one where he's looking at the mushrooms. I think it's a good fit
1:37:12
for this horizontal image. So let's go ahead. Now these images were uh taking
1:37:18
you can see the file format here are W2. These are Camera Raw which basically enables you to do a lot of color
1:37:25
adjustment. So I double cllicked it and again this is Adobe software. This is called Camera Raw. And let me just make
1:37:33
this a little bit smaller so we can see it here. Um, what I want to do here is
1:37:38
number one set the exposure like really higher to brighten it up. And also we've
1:37:44
got here temperature. So I can you can see I can move it from yellow to blue which is again and note the tone of the
1:37:52
image. Yellow blue again our style our vibe is much more cooler and bluish this
1:37:59
way. So, I think now it can fit the website. So, I'm hitting open. It basically opens it up in Photoshop for
1:38:06
me. Uh, actually the file size of this is huge and it's going to really slow down my Figma if I bring it in in the
1:38:13
original uh resolution. So, I'm going to go image size and actually going to turn it down to 33% of its original size. And
1:38:22
now I'm going to select it. Select it. Copy the image. And let's bring it to
1:38:29
Figma and see how that looks. Pasting it here. Okay, it looks good, but we can't see
1:38:35
him, right? So, this is again we need to go here into the fill of the image, change it to crop. And now you can
1:38:41
basically see we can move the image around so that we can see it. Uh, but we
1:38:47
we do have a problem, right? That if we see his face, which we want to see, we don't see much of the mushrooms.
1:38:54
So either we just, you know, um
1:39:01
either we give this a little bit more space, I guess, this way. And let's do
1:39:06
crop again. And let's resize this.
1:39:12
And let's see if we like this new crop.
1:39:18
You know what? Maybe this is actually I thought this was a good fit for the horizontal image. Maybe that's not true.
1:39:24
Let me undo that. Maybe let's paste it into this one. Yeah, that's actually much better because here you can see it
1:39:32
everything that he is doing. I can also go here into the crop and play around with it a little bit. Just like make it
1:39:37
a little bit bigger because we don't need this area here outside of the box. So now
1:39:43
he's focused on the box. Okay. Okay. So we've got this. So what do we what can we use for the horizontal one? Let's
1:39:51
see. Um, potentially it can be.
1:39:56
Do we want these bottles? Yeah, maybe this bottle. Let's try this. And I'm going to do the same process. I'm going
1:40:02
to make it brighter. Not too bright, but brighter. I'm going to bring the
1:40:07
temperature to a more cooler one. Now he's holding this liquid. Open that up.
1:40:13
Going to reduce the size of this 33%. Copy that. Let's see how that looks like
1:40:20
in this one. Okay, this is much better. This is much better. I'm going to adjust the crop as
1:40:27
well, just to bring it up a little bit. And you can see how important the crop is, right? Because it's what we're
1:40:32
seeing in the image. Uh, and these images, you can see now because we've made them cooler, they work well with
1:40:38
the images that we've got at the top. Last image. Which image should we go with for last?
1:40:46
Um, maybe this one. Let's go with the big mushroom. Let's bring up the exposure.
1:40:54
Let's make it cooler. Okay. And let's bring down the size.
1:41:02
In this case, I'm not even going to copy the whole thing. I'm just going to copy this area.
1:41:08
Let's uh because we don't need the other area of the photo. And let's bring it here. Okay. Not bad. I think it's not
1:41:15
bad. I can al also see that I think the gap that we have between these columns is a little bit bigger than the one that
1:41:22
we have at the top. So, I'm going to fix the spacing just a tiny notch. And yeah,
1:41:28
I like where we are so far. Not sure that all of these elements are aligned,
1:41:35
but okay, it's just now they are aligned. Okay, fantastic.
1:41:42
Okay, next our partners. So here they've basically sent me the logos. I'm going to delete these and let's see. They
1:41:48
basically gave me logo one, logo two, logo three. I'm going to bring them in together.
1:41:53
And I need to scale them down. So holding shift so that they retain their proportions. Uh now making logos look
1:42:01
good in a line is always a little bit tricky because as you can see some of them are wider, some of them are um some
1:42:09
of them are more rectangular or taller. So, you need to kind of like look at it
1:42:14
and make sure they align. Let's say top to bottom. I think this looks actually not very bad. Uh, let's see that they
1:42:22
have equal spacing between them. So, I'm going to select all of them and then distribute horizontal spacing. I'm going
1:42:28
to group them and then center them. Whoops. No, I'm just going to group them
1:42:34
in this and center all of them. And group this whole section. Let's call
1:42:39
this partner section. partner and make sure this the whole section is
1:42:44
centered. By the way, I didn't group all of this. This can be product
1:42:50
just so that we have a clean dock here. This this can be mission. So, I'm going
1:42:55
to group all of this mission. This is going to be the hero.
1:43:02
Group this hero. Okay. So, where are we? What we've got
1:43:07
left? We've got this contact form. Um,
1:43:13
actually, you know what? I want to do something fun. We haven't used the gradient and that we've created.
1:43:18
Although we do have the rainbow here and here, I think the the footer is actually a nice place to perhaps bring in this
1:43:26
gradient that we've created just for a little bit extra color. So, I'm just going to copy this, go back into my
1:43:32
design, and here in the footer. Let's just paste it here. Uh, yeah, I think
1:43:39
that's going to be cool. So, going to take this and make ourselves a little
1:43:46
bit of a colorful footer that we have here. And the reason this is helpful is
1:43:53
I was thinking, what color should we do the the button? And it doesn't really matter, but I can click the I for color
1:44:00
picker and maybe pick this purplish one. So, that looks good. For these ones,
1:44:07
actually, let's let's bring in the Let's go back into our mood board. We
1:44:12
have this grayish one. So, let's copy this and bring it just put it here on
1:44:17
the side just so that we can go ahead and sample using the eyropper this gray that we have here. So, this is great.
1:44:25
Okay. So, we've got this this one. We can also pick the gray. Or maybe maybe
1:44:32
if we want to make this a button, maybe we can make this also H. So, I'm
1:44:37
wondering whether I want to have this circle as purple or gray. I'm going to go with gray for now. And I wanted to
1:44:45
bring in the email icon, which I lost. So, let me
1:44:50
search again for email at iconfinder free.
1:44:55
outline. Select this one. And I'm just going to do copy SVG to clipboard. Done.
1:45:02
Going to go back and paste it here. And that looks great. So this is great. So
1:45:10
now we've got this. Actually, this looks good. Going to go ahead and group all of
1:45:17
this together into contact. The last thing that I want to do
1:45:24
is I feel like we could use a little bit nicer kind of like
1:45:30
um cut or distinction between for the partners section. And I think what I'm
1:45:36
going to do is I'm just going to copy this rectangular gradient that we've got here. And let me paste it. And maybe
1:45:44
let's just turn it into a very very thin line. So, I can actually manually do
1:45:50
this like height two pixels. Um,
1:45:55
wait, no, it it changes the width as well because they are connected. So, let's just change the height to two
1:46:02
pixels. And let's just put it here. And let's duplicate another one. Whoops. Let's
1:46:09
duplicate by dragging to the bottom here. So, now we created this kind of like a better
1:46:16
organization. Uh, a little bit more spacing. I actually like this. I think this is
1:46:23
nice. I think these gradient lines are nice. Okay, with that, I think our page
1:46:30
is designed. Now, I don't want to mislead you. I kind of went in and just
1:46:36
did the design, but honestly, when I have more time, I would explore
1:46:41
so many things. I would explore different layouts. Hey, what happens if the heading is on the right? What
1:46:47
happens if this is an image that takes up the whole screen? There's so many things. What I would actually do go
1:46:52
ahead and do is I'd probably duplicate this and say, let's see what happens if this image is in the hero and let's
1:46:58
experiment and try so many more things. I would basically have a lot of duplications here to compare things.
1:47:04
Like I showed you, I would compare different fonts. I would compare different designs, different layouts, maybe different font sizes uh to explore
1:47:12
more variations on this. But for this purpose, I just want to make it very very simple. Um, so I just went ahead
1:47:19
and basically did a very very simple design. Now, sometimes you're going to
1:47:24
also want to design responsive breakpoints. So, how is this going to look like on mobile? I personally don't
1:47:31
like doing it if I'm the one developing the website. I feel like it's a waste of time because I can basically figure out,
1:47:36
I'm going to show you when we're going to develop this website how I'm thinking about this. But sometimes if especially if you uh delegate to a different
1:47:44
developer, you might want to create, you know, a new page here. Um, for example,
1:47:49
phone, maybe iPhone or something like this. And now you're going to go ahead and adjust this whole design for how
1:47:56
it's going to look like on mobile, for example. Again, I'm not going to do this and we're going to talk more about responsiveness when we're going to get
1:48:02
into the development side of things. But I think for the purposes of our course, I'm good with this design and I'm ready
1:48:08
to move in and talk to you about getting this developed. So, I'll see you in the next chapter.
Chapter Five: Development
1:48:18
Now that we have a nice static design, it's time to see how we're turning this into a real published website that
1:48:23
people can visit. Since I assume that you're new to web design, I'm going to give you a clear picture of how the
1:48:28
internet works so that you can understand how our new website is going to fit into the internet. So, how does
1:48:34
the internet work? Well, you're using a browser right now, something like Chrome or Safari. When you put in a URL like
1:48:41
Google.com, these letters, which we call a domain name, are being translated into numbers, something like 192.158.1.38.
1:48:52
Those numbers are called IP address. And much like your home address, it basically tells the browser where to go
1:48:57
and look for the website files. And where are they? Well, technically, if you want, you could link your domain to
1:49:04
your own computer, but for many reasons, we usually don't want to do this, right? You don't want your computer to or your
1:49:10
website to be down every time you close your computer. So, usually you would pay a service provider uh which we call a
1:49:16
hosting platform to host your files somewhere in the cloud. Now what are those files? Well, the core of every
1:49:23
website is an HTML file which is a file that includes the structure and the text of the website. Then we have another
1:49:29
file type which we call CSS which stands for cascading stylesheet which basically takes care of how things look. Remember
1:49:36
that we created those text styles in Figma which determine how every heading looks like. Well, those settings are
1:49:42
stored in the CSS files so that we can use a single file across all the pages of the website so that they share the
1:49:48
same styles. Now, of course, we also have files for our images and videos, and we sometimes have files for
1:49:54
JavaScript that are create some more advanced functionalities like animations or the the logical forms. So, at this
1:50:01
point, what we have is a bunch of files that are hosted on somebody's else computer, which we link our domain name
1:50:07
to. Now, I hope I don't overwhelm you. Uh, there's one more thing that we do need to consider. We can assume that our
1:50:14
clients don't know how to write or edit HTML files and also they don't want to pay us every time they want to make a
1:50:20
change in in a heading or an image on their website uh or every time they want to publish a new blog post for example.
1:50:27
So we need to give them some kind of an easy way for them to edit their website. Now we call these solution CMS which
1:50:34
stands for content management system. Now you've probably heard of some of them. One of the most popular one on the
1:50:40
internet is called WordPress. And by the way, it's not popular because it's the best. It's popular because it's free. Uh
1:50:47
other website builders like Wix or Squarespace or Web Flow or Framer, they also include a CMS. Now, when you're
1:50:54
using a CMS like WordPress, uh you need to pick a hosting service like for example, GoDaddy. Uh and then you
1:51:00
install WordPress, the CMS on this hosting service. The other options that I've mentioned actually include the
1:51:06
hosting service together with the CMS and the builder so that you don't have to take care of the hosting. It's kind
1:51:12
of like allin-one solution. Now, whatever solution you're going to use, your clients will need to pay some kind
1:51:18
of a fee to host the website. So, now you're asking yourself, which one of them should you use or your clients use?
1:51:25
Now, this is a a big controversial topic and we have many videos comparing all of
1:51:30
these options here on our channel. However, my favorite solution and the one that I think is best for the
1:51:36
professional process is Web Flow. And that's what I'm going to show you right now. So, let's dive into it and build a
1:51:42
website we designed in Web Flow. I'm here in Web Flow creating a new website. And you can open up a free Web Flow
1:51:47
account if you want to do this yourself. And I'm going to start from a blank website. Uh you can start with templates, but that's not what we're
1:51:54
going to do right now. So, I'm going to call this uh my website is Massix.
1:51:59
Massix uh website. and let's create a site. Okay, so we've got a blank web flow
1:52:06
website. Our first thing is to bring all of our assets into this website. And by assets, I mean the imagery that we're
1:52:13
using and also the font that we chose to u use here. Now, some of these images I
1:52:19
already have here in the folder because I got them from the clients and these images uh I got from Midjourney. But I
1:52:26
do need to export my logo. So in Figma, the way that you export it is you select
1:52:31
the element that you want to uh export and then right here from the export panel you can click this plus and then
1:52:38
basically gives you some export uh options. Now in general for things like
1:52:43
logos or icons uh we want to use a vector uh a vector file. And by the way,
1:52:49
we didn't dive deeply into what vector is, but I can just tell you that vector is basically, you know, when when you
1:52:56
have something here that is being calculated, uh the the shapes are being calculated by code, then you can see
1:53:03
that no matter how long I'm zooming, I can zoom in really nice. The lines are still kind of like very very smooth.
1:53:10
While we have image, if we're continuing to zoom in, you can see that we're actually seeing the pixels. So this is
1:53:16
pixelbased. images are pixelbased. We call them raster images. While uh things
1:53:21
like text, logos, and icons are vector-based because they're basically
1:53:27
there's a code that calculates the shape of this. So, it's going to be best if we
1:53:32
export this in SVG, which is the vector um vector file size. So, I'm going to
1:53:38
hit export logo. And here uh let's do this logo main. Let's call this. And
1:53:44
also what we want to export, we'll zoom here into the this email icon. And we
1:53:50
can go here and export this as an SVG as well. SVG. I'll call this email icon.
1:53:58
Now the other things that we do uh want to export are these images because these
1:54:03
images um we've actually copy and pasted them from Photoshop with the color correction. So I don't have them saved
1:54:09
with the color correction. So what I can do basically is I can just click this
1:54:14
and then do export. However, it's going to export them with round corners and
1:54:19
it's going to uh export them in exactly this shape which is not really what I want because some of these shapes might
1:54:27
change based on responsiveness. So I actually want the original image. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
1:54:32
copy this and paste it here uh outside and I'm going to remove the round
1:54:38
corners and I'm actually going to change here in the image from crop. I want to see fit so that I can see the whole
1:54:45
image and let's increase it. Okay. So now I have basically the original image and I can go here into export. This one
1:54:52
needs to be a raster image. Now we do have two other types here which is PNG and JPEG. JPEG is basically just an
1:54:59
image, regular image and PNG includes transparency. So if you have transparent background, if you have kind of like a
1:55:04
shape uh and then a transparent background, you put you will pick PNG. In this case, we're going to pick JPEG.
1:55:11
And the other thing we're going to do is not to export it in its original size. And you can see here that the size of
1:55:17
this image is 682 pixels width uh width on 511 pixels height. I actually want to
1:55:24
change this to two times this size. And the reason is that on newer screen
1:55:29
sizes, actually newer screens uh for Mac, for iPhones and stuff like that, we
1:55:34
have uh what Apple actually called retina display or I think Apple uh Google calls this HD HD DPI or something
1:55:42
like this, which basically means that they have double the pixel density. So actually, if we want this to look sharp
1:55:48
in high quality, we need to export the asset in two times its actual size. So
1:55:53
let's export this. And I'm going to call this lab one. And I'm going to do the
1:55:58
same for these images. So I'm going to paste it. Take it out here. Remove the
1:56:04
corners. Change the image to fit again. Um, make it a little bit bigger. And
1:56:11
then export it JPEG 2x the size. This one we'll call lab two. And the last
1:56:19
image. Copy paste. Move that here. and do the same thing over again.
1:56:27
And I think that with that we have all of our assets. Let me do this quickly.
1:56:34
This going to be lab three. Okay. So the rest of the assets I think that we have
1:56:40
we have these logos. Okay. So we're good. So back here in my web flow
1:56:45
websites on the left side I have my assets panel. And what I'm going to do is uh I'm going to click here, upload,
1:56:54
and I have all of my images. I'm just going to go ahead and upload them. So nice. We've got all of the images that
1:57:00
we're going to use throughout the website. The next thing that we need to do is to load up the fonts. Now, Web
1:57:05
Flow by default has some Google fonts loaded, but I'm not sure that's what we need. So, we're going to go here into
1:57:11
site settings. And from the site settings, we're going to go into fonts. Now, we basically need two fonts. We
1:57:16
need inter which is the body font uh which is a Google font. So we should be able to find it from this list. If I'm
1:57:23
going to type enter enter here we go. Now we also uh web flow asks us what
1:57:30
kind of you know variants or width you know light medium bold we want to load.
1:57:35
Now you can say hey I'm just going to check all of them so that I can choose whatever I want. However loading more f
1:57:42
font files into your website slows down your website. So ideally we want to choose not many or exactly what we need.
1:57:50
And I think that if I'm going to go here into the properties I can see that interregular that's the only thing that
1:57:56
we need. I think uh and I guess regular is this one that's selected. So I'm just going to do add font. So we've got that
1:58:02
one. The other font that we have this one the saffron font that we purchased
1:58:08
is actually a custom font and it's a a paid font. So it it's not included here.
1:58:13
So, I can just upload the files. And in here, I've got the font files that I got. And you can see here that we've got
1:58:20
the web fonts. And actually, I want to see which ones we're using, the medium. I think we are only using the mediums.
1:58:27
Now, you can see here under web fonts, it's got a bunch of different uh files. And I'm going to have to upload all of
1:58:33
them. These just make sure that uh this font works across all devices, across
1:58:39
all browsers. So, there's kind of redundancy of files here. And you can see here that we need to upload all of
1:58:44
these formats. Um, so I'm basically doing upload font file, upload, upload,
1:58:50
uploading all of them. And once I'm done, you can see that they are loaded
1:58:56
and they should be available for us in the designer. So let's go ahead back into our designer. And now we can
1:59:03
actually start designing. So let's see what we have here. The first thing I
1:59:08
want to tackle is this navigation that we have here. Okay. So, for the
1:59:14
navigation, actually, we already have I'm going to go here into the ad panel in Web Flow, and we've got a bunch of
1:59:20
elements. We actually already have a pre-built navbar that I can go ahead and
1:59:26
throw in here. Now the the the reason that we're using this pre-built component is that when we're going to
1:59:32
start t talking about what happens in mobile, how do things look like in mobile and you can see here right at the
1:59:38
top of web flow's panel here you can see different break points. So how the website is going to look like on mobile
1:59:44
or on tablet and stuff like that and you can see here that the menu has changed into a hamburger menu which we can click
1:59:50
to open up this menu. So we like this functionality we want this. So by using
1:59:55
Web Flow's native uh navigation uh element, we already have that out of the
2:00:01
box and now we can just go ahead and customize how this looks. Now you can see here that the structure and we can
2:00:07
see the structure here. So we've got body which is the whole page and then we have this navbar element. Inside of it
2:00:13
we have a container which we're going to talk about in a second and then it got uh this kind of link that is called a
2:00:19
brand which is basically a place for the logo. The reason that it's a link is because it's very common in websites
2:00:24
that the logo is clickable and it's going to take you to the homepage and then it's got this menu with a few links
2:00:32
right here. So, let's actually go ahead and start bringing in uh some of the elements. So, I'm going to go here.
2:00:38
Let's take the logo. This is the logo. And drag it into here. And we can
2:00:44
actually go ahead and change what we have here. Mission product contact. So, let's go ahead and write mission
2:00:52
uh product and contact. Okay, so that's great. It does not look how we want it
2:00:58
to look. Now, by default, and don't ask me why, uh Webflow decided that their navbar is going to have a gray
2:01:05
background, but that's not what we want. So, now we're starting to style things to make sure that they look exactly how
2:01:10
we want them to look. Now, right here on the right side, we've got the styling panel. And if you remember I've
2:01:17
mentioned earlier HTML is basically the structure which you can see here and CSS how things look like is basically
2:01:23
controlled from here. And much like in uh Figma where we added styles to control how things look like we're
2:01:29
adding styles here and you can see here style selected and these are called classes. So for the navbar I'm going to
2:01:35
give this a name. I'm going to call this uh navbar. And if I'm going to scroll down here
2:01:41
we've got a bunch of properties. You can see that the background by default was set to this gray and I can actually
2:01:47
change it to white which is what I want. So this is great. Now we've already controlled this. Now we've got this
2:01:54
container thing which as you can see controls that these things are not wide
2:01:59
all the way edge to edge. It keeps them kind of like centered. And it's a great place to talk about containers for a
2:02:05
little bit because in Figma we've designed things and they look great. But the truth is this is a actually a
2:02:12
static, you know, size of a page that is, you know, 1,400 pixels wide. But
2:02:18
people have different screen sizes and not everybody's going to have a screen that's exactly 1,400 pixels. So we need
2:02:25
to consider the question, what happens if the screen is actually wider, right? What happens? What happens if the screen
2:02:32
might be uh, you know, smaller? What's going to happen to all of the content inside? Now, by default, right now, you
2:02:39
can see that nothing happens. They're staying aligned to the left side of the screen, and that's not really good,
2:02:45
right? So, one more thing that we can do, and I can select all of these elements um in my Figma file, right? And
2:02:53
you can see here we've got constraints. So, right now the width is aligned to the left. I can also say, you know, uh
2:03:01
center them. Okay? So, let me actually scale back the page size.
2:03:07
to our original page size. Uh, and if I would select all of these right now,
2:03:13
let's select them from here and do center. Then right now, what would
2:03:19
happen is if I'm if the screen is smaller or larger, they're actually just
2:03:25
staying in the center. And of course, one more thing that can happen is that when I select all of them, they will
2:03:32
start scratching uh stretching. So, we can pick scale. And if I'm now if I'm
2:03:37
going to resize my screen size, you can see that these things start to stretch. So in this case, there is really no
2:03:44
right or wrong. You have to as a designer to make the decision of what do you want to happen. However, that being
2:03:52
said, a lot of times stretching the content doesn't really work. Uh especially if you have text, if you
2:03:58
have, you know, content all across the screen, it makes it difficult to read. So a lot of times what we would do is we
2:04:05
would select center and we would basically decide that you know we have some kind of a maximum width of the
2:04:12
content. Of course if this the screen is smaller it's going to have to uh contract but if this if you have a
2:04:17
really wide screen it's going to have some kind of a maximum width and then everything is going to stay centered.
2:04:23
And this is basically the role of a container. So like we have here the container basically defines what is the
2:04:29
maximum width after which it's just going to stay fixed in the center right.
2:04:34
So in this case uh web flow gives us some kind of a default and it does look much smaller than the what we have right
2:04:40
here. And you can see if I select this element and you can see that we've basically have the width of our design
2:04:45
is basically 1,300 pixels uh you know not exactly even a little bit uh larger
2:04:51
but I can go ahead and I can give this a class here and call this container um and then you have here in the size
2:04:58
maximum width and I can set this to let's do 1300 pixels and now you can see that it's much wider however even if the
2:05:06
screen is going to be it's not exactly getting to the edges of the screen because the screen is a little bit
2:05:11
bigger. Um, and that's going to be the the maximum width. And we're going to use this because all of these sections
2:05:17
have this exact maximum width. So that's going to be great. And we're to reuse
2:05:22
this container again and again. So basically, we've got this. The next thing we want to do is to uh maybe style
2:05:30
how these links look like. And basically the way I'm going to do this is I'm
2:05:35
going to give them a class as well. I'm going to call them nav link. Now the great thing about classes is that once I
2:05:44
created it once I can reuse it again and again and we've done that in Figma as well right so um I can select navl link
2:05:53
from here and apply this class to all of them and now any change I'm going to make here and you can see if I make the
2:05:58
the text size bigger there it's going to be applied to all the elements that have
2:06:03
this class and now I can go here and start seeing okay this navl link what is
2:06:09
it. I can I can go ahead and check the properties to go ahead and um actually I
2:06:15
see that it has a medium and I don't think that we've even brought the medium
2:06:20
um weight of in but we're not even having we the the font is not even in
2:06:26
it's aerial so we need to change the font now I can go ahead and change the font for navling however because we're
2:06:32
going to reuse this font in is basically the you can call it the default font of text in this website one thing that I
2:06:38
can do is I can actually apply this class to the body, the biggest element of the whole page. And then everything
2:06:45
else on this page, unless we define it uh differently, is going to use this same style. So, let's go ahead and do
2:06:52
this. And I'm basically picking up the body. Um I can either pick it from down
2:06:57
here below or I can pick it from this navigator. And you can see here this body, I actually don't need to give it a
2:07:02
class because there's a basically a body class that is anyway applied to all pages. So, I'm just going to pick this
2:07:09
one and scroll down here into my typography and I'm going to pick enter.
2:07:14
Uh, let's see where we have in. So, that's it. We've got enter. And that looks great. So, now you can see
2:07:20
automatically these nav links are now now have in. And let's see if we have the Yeah, we don't have the medium
2:07:26
because we didn't load it. And I feel a little bit too lazy to go and load it from the site settings as we did
2:07:31
previously. So, I'm going to keep it that way. However, I do want and I can see here that they do have more spacing
2:07:39
from left between them. Now, you can see here and we didn't talk too much about the box model which is a very important
2:07:46
concept in web design, but you can see that actually this element is a box and this element is a box. Everything that
2:07:52
we touch here is basically a box. And if we go here, we can basically see the spacing. So there's inside of this
2:07:59
element we have uh spacing which is called padding inside of this box. So we've got 20 pixels as you can see the
2:08:05
green marks it. There's 20 pixels at the top, at the bottom, at the left and at the right. So that controls the
2:08:11
settings. And I can actually go ahead and increase the setting uh from left and right by dragging this and holding
2:08:18
the option key so it the change applies to both sides. And now you can see that
2:08:24
instead of um 20, let's make it 40 at this point. So now this element has 40
2:08:30
pixels of space from left and right all of them because they're using the same class and it's a little bit more spaced
2:08:35
out and I like this. So I'm going to keep it that way. The last thing that we have is we've got this brand and the
2:08:41
logo is a little bit too big. Also, I want it to be spaced out from the top as well. So how am I going to style it? I'm
2:08:47
going to give it a class and I'm going to call this logo or even main logo because we're going to have additional
2:08:53
logos here. I want to make this a little bit smaller. So, I'm going to add a maximum width. Again, if the screen is
2:09:00
smaller, we might need it to be smaller, but this is too big. So, let's do maximum width. I don't know, 250 pixels.
2:09:07
That actually looks better to me. So, I'm going to keep it that way. And I'm going to add a little bit of padding from just from the top. So, I'm just
2:09:14
dragging here. Um, and actually let's bring it to 20 so that I know that the spacing here is aligned with this
2:09:21
spacing. Maybe a tiny bit less because these letters are bigger, I guess. So, I'm
2:09:27
just kind of like eyeballing it. Yeah, looks good. I'm happy with it. Okay, so we've got the navbar ready. Pretty much
2:09:35
ready. And it's time to go and work on the next section. Now, to do that, I'm
2:09:41
actually going to go ahead to the ad panel and add a section. Now, the section basically, it's kind of like a
2:09:47
group. Remember that we grouped these things together. Here we've got the hero and we've got all the elements together.
2:09:52
So, a section is basically kind of like a grouping element or an organizing element. Um, and we're going to create a
2:09:58
section element for each one of these section. And it will allow us to control them all together. And you'll see how that's going to be beneficial a little
2:10:04
bit later on. So, I'm going to drag in a section in that section. In this section as well, we also need a container
2:10:11
because we need it to be, you know, to have the same maximum width just like the navigation. So, we also have a
2:10:17
container here. So, I'm going to drag in a container. Now, you can see that this container is smaller than the container
2:10:22
that I have uh at the top. That's because we didn't apply the class and this is kind of like a diff container.
2:10:28
So, you can see I'm just tapping here and it suggestes existing classes and we've got container here. So, now I've
2:10:34
picked it. Now, we've got this. Great. The next thing that we have before I'm
2:10:39
starting to throw in the content is basically we're thinking about the layout. And in this case, we've we've
2:10:45
got a two column layout. We've got text on the left and image on the right. So to do that, I'm going to create a simple
2:10:51
grid. And I'm going to do that using Web Flow's quick stack, which is a way I'm going to drag that inside so you can
2:10:57
see. It's a basically a way to create layouts and grids. In this case, even the default is two sales left and right.
2:11:03
And that's basically what I need. So that's it. So now we already have an organizational tool that's going to
2:11:09
enable us to bring in you know the content. One thing though and I'm
2:11:14
looking at I'm trying to think about the spacing between them because I think the
2:11:19
spacing here is not big enough and I'm looking at what is the spacing between these elements. And in Figma by the way
2:11:26
I can pick two elements and if I hit you know alt and you can see here check out
2:11:31
this little red number here 46. It basically tells me that the space between this image and this image is 46
2:11:38
pixels. Um, so I want the spacing to be equal. So at the bottom it's going to be 46 and also here 46. So let's go here. H
2:11:48
actually when I have this quick stack and we can give it a class so that we might want to reuse it. I can call it
2:11:54
two call uh to call grid. Okay. And you can see here that we can control the gap
2:12:00
between these columns. And currently it's the uh the the spacing between the
2:12:06
rows is 20 pixel. Let's turn that to 40. Let's make it 50 just for the sake of uh
2:12:11
going to change the number. Instead of 46, let's just use 50. Okay. So now we've got these. Let's start bringing in
2:12:19
the elements. So in this one, what what do we have? We have this H1 element. So
2:12:24
to do that, we have a heading here from the typography menu. I'm going to drag that here. It's a heading. You can see I
2:12:30
can pick the heading H1, H2. And this is important for Google to know what is the heading of your website. Okay. So, let's
2:12:38
copy the text. Copy the text here. This is great. It's still not styled, but at least it's the right element. And then
2:12:43
we've got this subheading, which is just it's a normal text. So, from the
2:12:49
typography, I'm just going to bring in a text block. I'm going to put this on top here. And just going to copy this text
2:12:56
here. Okay. So, we've got the text. They're still not styled, and we'll do that in a
2:13:02
second. Let's bring in the image here. So, let's go here and drag the hero
2:13:08
image here. Fantastic. We've got these. So, first thing, actually, the first
2:13:13
thing, let's let's style the image. The only styling that we have is basically these round corners. So, let's pick the
2:13:20
image and let's give it a class and we're going to call it round image.
2:13:25
Round corners. So, we know what it does. And we we're obviously going to reuse
2:13:30
this on these other ele uh elements. So that's going to be reusable. And I'm going to slide all the way to the
2:13:37
bottom. And we've got uh corner radius here. And I'm going to do 30 pixels. And
2:13:43
basically we've got that. So that is styled. That's nice. The next thing I
2:13:48
want to do before I actually even pick the fonts and style the typography is I want to make sure that these things are
2:13:54
actually aligned to the center. So, if I'm kick uh clicking on this left cell
2:13:59
that we've got here, actually, if I go here, you can see here in the layout, I
2:14:06
can pick the alignment and the justification. Currently, they're aligned to the top, but I can also go ahead and click center, and it's going
2:14:12
to center them. Now, note that I didn't give this a class, but because I made the change, Web Flow automatically gave
2:14:19
this a class and called it cell. I'm going to rename this just so that if I want to reuse this again to center
2:14:26
things horizontally, I can reuse this instead of creating more and more styles and I don't remember what this does cell
2:14:32
means. So let's call this uh um
2:14:37
vertically centered cell. Uh and some of you who are into
2:14:44
development might say, "Oh, Ron, are you using dashes? How are you naming your classes?" I'm not going to get into this
2:14:50
right now. So, for now, I'm just going to do it capital letters on every uh word. There's many religions about how
2:14:56
to name your classes. We're not going to go into this right now. Okay, let's style these classes. So, this is an H1.
2:15:03
Now, in general, so far we've been giving classes, but as I showed you with the body, we can actually uh change the
2:15:10
default H1 so that if we have other pages on the website, if we give this
2:15:16
style, we don't have to add a class. Every time we just add an H1 element, it's going to get that class. So, this
2:15:21
is great. I'm going to edit this and going to go into my typography and pick
2:15:27
saffron. Where is that? It's in the custom font. Uh, what was the size of it? I think it was 50. Uh, it looks a
2:15:34
little bit too tight in the line height because you can see line height is 44. So, I'm going to click the up button
2:15:40
until I think it looks good. And of course, I can copy these parameters from Figma. Um,
2:15:46
I can copy these parameters, but I'm just eyeballing it right now.
2:15:52
This one is a subheading. We called it subheading. So, let's call it subheading here as well. And I think this was 18 or
2:16:01
16. This needs to be uppercase. So, we have more type options and uppercase. This actually needs to be a little bit
2:16:07
bolder. So, I think the fact that I forgot to load the medium in I'm going
2:16:14
to have to go and do this right now. So, let's go and do this because I'm missing um I'm missing the
2:16:22
bolder interfont. So, let's go here. Enter. And also load up the I guess
2:16:28
let's do 600. Let's try 600 and see if that works. Okay. going back into the
2:16:34
designer and let's apply this both to the mission. We can go here and now so
2:16:41
now that we've loaded the additional font I can go here and now I will have the semib bold here. So we can apply
2:16:47
this to both the menu and this subheading. Let's change that. So that
2:16:53
looks good. There's a little bit too much space between the heading and this
2:16:58
one. And you can see it's probably because uh right here in the default H1,
2:17:04
it has 20 pixels of padding at the top and 10 at the bottom. So, let me reduce that. Yeah, I think this looks better.
2:17:11
Okay. So, we basically have the first section done. And now we've got the
2:17:17
second section. So, to do that, I can actually because we're going to need to use the same section. Uh I'm actually
2:17:25
going to give this class this section a class and I'm going to call it section. Now the reason I'm going to do this is
2:17:31
that later on and you can start seeing this if going to scale back when we're
2:17:37
going to think about responsiveness is that oh wait we do need to have um
2:17:42
padding from left and right and we need to control the spacing. Um so I want to have a class maybe I also want spacing
2:17:50
between each section. So, for example, you can see that we've got a space between this section and this section
2:17:56
again of 50 pixels. So, I'm going to go ahead and add the bottom margin. And
2:18:01
margin is the space outside of the box. I'm going to add here 50 pixels. So, I need to manage the spacing and sections
2:18:09
consistently. So, it's good to have a class. And now, what I can do is I can actually copy and paste the section
2:18:14
twice because I do need the section. I do need the container. The only thing that's going to be different is I don't
2:18:20
need this uh two column grid. I need something else here. So let's just delete the content inside, but we still
2:18:26
have the same structure. So what do we need here? So here basically we have a big box and we do have a text that's on
2:18:34
top of the image. So what we're going to do is I think we're going to create a big box that's going to hold the text.
2:18:40
And in web design we call these boxes divs, right? So div is basically a holder kind of like a group that can
2:18:46
hold content and we're going to give it a background image of this image and
2:18:52
there's going to be text inside of it. So let me show you how we're going to do this. So we're going to bring in and you
2:18:57
can see here basic div block and it looks like a box. I'm going to drag it here and this one let's call this
2:19:05
mission. Yeah, mission uh block. Mission block. Um, first of all, I want
2:19:13
it to be kind of like big, right? Um, so how big is this? And you can see that the height of this is 700. So actually,
2:19:20
let's go ahead and give this a height of 700. And now you can see that this box is bigger. Now, we also want to give
2:19:27
this a background. So from the backgrounds, I'm going to scroll here into the background. And I can pick a
2:19:33
color, but in this case, I want to pick an image. And I'm going to choose an image. And let's pick this one here.
2:19:40
Now, as you can see, because the image is pretty big, we're actually just getting a crop of his forehead, which is
2:19:45
not what we want. So, from the properties here, I'm going to set the size from custom to cover, which
2:19:50
basically means just make sure that the the image covers or fits the best that
2:19:56
it can inside of this box. And that that actually looks pretty good. So, I'm happy about that. I do want to give this
2:20:03
round corners. So, I'm also going to use 30 pixels round corners here as well. And now I can already see that we have
2:20:10
an alignment problem because they don't align. This element that we have here,
2:20:15
the two column grid for some reason adds an extra space here. And you can see and I really want things to be aligned.
2:20:21
That's really important in design. So I'm going to go here into the top and you can see that the two column grid has
2:20:27
20 pixels padding on all sides. We actually don't want this. So I'm going
2:20:32
to remove all of them. I'm just going to drag up while holding option and alt.
2:20:38
And now there's no padding. And now, yeah, it actually is spaced nice. Okay.
2:20:44
So, we've got the image. Now, we need to start bringing in the content in here. So, what do we have? We have a
2:20:50
subheading and then we have an H2 heading and then we have a paragraph. So, first of all, subheading we already
2:20:56
have. So, I'm just going to copy here and paste it inside here. and a heading we also have and I can copy this and
2:21:03
bring this here. Although if I'm going to go into the setting when it changes from H1 to H2 which is unstyled. Let's
2:21:10
also start copying the text. So this is mass mission. Uh that's great. And this is new area of
2:21:18
medicine. So this is also great. Let's copy and paste this. Now as you can see
2:21:23
because we didn't set it otherwise they're actually aligned to the top left
2:21:29
corner. It's basically kind of like a Google. If you don't set other properties, then it's just going to
2:21:35
start at the top and left. So, actually, let's go ahead and center this. Uh, so when I'm holding the mission block, the
2:21:42
block that aligns all of them, I can go here into the typography and set it to align center. So, now they're centered.
2:21:49
I also want a little bit of space, a little bit of padding inside of this box so that it's not really at the edge or
2:21:56
touching the edge of the box. So, let's also add padding from the top. Um,
2:22:02
something like 50 pixels, I guess, makes sense. So, this looks good. Let's style the H2. So, again, I'm going to edit the
2:22:10
H2, the default HTML tag of H2. So, every H2 that I'm going to add from now on is going to have this class. And I'm
2:22:17
going to change that to saffron, uh, which is medium. And I think the H2
2:22:22
was 35 maybe or maybe 40. Let's check actually what we had here. So, we've got
2:22:28
the H2 and that's 42. Okay, so the size is 42. That's great.
2:22:36
And now we need a paragraph. We haven't used paragraphs before, but here it is. We've got a paragraph and we're going to
2:22:42
put it in here. And the paragraph is good, but it's very, very wide. You can see here that the paragraph is actually
2:22:49
limited. It's constrained to, let's see, it its width is 510 pixels. Uh, and here
2:22:56
because we didn't define otherwise, whoa, it's going all the all the way from left to right and that's not really
2:23:01
easy to read. So, I want to find a way to constrain it. And actually the the I
2:23:09
what I think is actually all of these elements right now these are short headlines but even if they were long
2:23:16
right what I do want is I basically want all of these text to fit inside of these box and not go outside of it so that the
2:23:24
text is contained here in the center. The way that to do that is instead of just basically managing the maximum
2:23:31
width of each one of these elements individually, let's actually group them together and set that the box holding
2:23:38
them together, the group holding them together is going to have this maximum width. To do that, I'm going to place
2:23:43
them inside of a div. We call this wrapping elements. So note what I'm doing. I'm bringing in an empty div and
2:23:50
then I'm putting all of these elements inside of this div. uh the order is not
2:23:56
right. So let's go here and do the subheading first and then the heading and then the paragraph. So now you can
2:24:02
see they're all nested inside of this div block which I can call maybe mission text and just this uh the wrapper I'm
2:24:12
going to give this a maximum width of maybe 510. And now you can see that it
2:24:17
is limited. It is also not centered. So to center it, I'm going to go into the spacing and I'm going to click this
2:24:24
button, center element. So that is great. So now we have it. The the size
2:24:29
of this is limited and I think the text is much more readable that way. And we basically have the second section done
2:24:36
as well. So maybe maybe the spacing here is not right. So, let me go ahead into
2:24:43
editing the H2 and reduce the space from the top and maybe add a little bit space
2:24:50
to the bottom actually. So, I think I'm going to do it this way. 10 pixels
2:24:56
spacing from the top and 20 from the bottom. I think this looks better. Okay. So, we've got first section done. We've
2:25:03
got the second section down. Now, we've got this third section. Okay.
2:25:08
Now, this one starts looking off similar to this because it has two columns. Uh,
2:25:14
but then this area gets a little bit more complex. So, let's see how we're going to do this. I think I'm going to
2:25:19
just duplicate I think I'm just going to duplicate the first section again. Copy
2:25:24
that, paste it, and bring it here. And what I'm going to do, we can actually,
2:25:31
we also have the same elements here, right? So, we've got this subheading which I can paste here. We've got this
2:25:38
H2 which I can paste here. And then we've got a paragraph which we can
2:25:43
actually copy this paragraph and paste it below here and paste this text here.
2:25:51
So this is great. We've got the content, but here we've got a more complicated um a more complicated grid structure.
2:25:57
Actually, you can think about this that instead of two columns, maybe it's four columns um or or one big column and then
2:26:07
two small columns and this one spans. So, actually, let's do this. So, we have
2:26:12
this whole element that's holding them together. It's currently called two column grid, but let's duplicate it and
2:26:18
turn it into something else. Let's duplicate this class and call this uh product grid. Product grid. And let's go
2:26:26
ahead and edit how this looks like. So let's turn this into maybe three columns.
2:26:33
But what I want is I want these columns to be half. Let's drag this to be half
2:26:40
and half. Uh let's drag this a little bit. Okay. So note what we have one.
2:26:46
This is called one FR and this is half FR and half FR. So this is great. This is basically this is half of this which
2:26:54
is basically what we want. We also want uh two rows in this case. And what we
2:27:02
want is let's go ahead here. What we want is for this one to span both of
2:27:08
these rows. So I'm going to click this bottom uh arrow. And this thing
2:27:14
I think this top cell here is um let's
2:27:19
see how we're going to do this actually let's remove the image here and let's span this top one two columns and
2:27:28
basically now we've got our structure right we span these uh the top and bottom rows this one spans both of them
2:27:35
let's start bringing in the images and seeing uh how this looks so let's bring
2:27:40
in which is the top image. He's holding the
2:27:45
Okay, let's bring that in. As you can see, this is not the same proportions. So, I think we're going to
2:27:51
have to change it uh in a bit. But let's bring in the images first.
2:27:59
The image where he's looking at this. And then the third image
2:28:07
is the mushroom. All right. We've got the images. Uh you can see
2:28:15
they have different sizes of the images. All right. So, we're going to have to fix the sizing as well. But first, I can
2:28:22
I think I can start with the round corners. Applying the image round corners.
2:28:27
Image round corners. And image round corners. Now, this one I want this to be. Let's
2:28:34
see what the actual height of this. The height here is 200. and let's say 290
2:28:40
pixels. So I'm going to add a combo class to this image. That means that on
2:28:46
top of round corners, it's going to have a different style that's unique only to it. So let's call it top lab image and
2:28:54
set the size here to 290. Uh but the width, I do want the width to
2:29:01
be 100%. So it's going to span all across. But note what happened. the image is actually stretched, which is
2:29:07
not what I want. So, you can see here we've got fit and it's trying to fill in the image. And what we want to do is set
2:29:13
it to cover. Pretty similar to what we did here. Uh, basically make sure that the whole space is filled, but don't
2:29:20
stretch the image. So, this looks good. Um, and what do we have here? How high these ones are? These are also 290.
2:29:29
Actually, if this is 290, then I think I can apply the same uh top lab image
2:29:35
actually to this one as well. Top lab image. Yeah, this is great. And then let's apply top lab image to this. Okay,
2:29:43
so basically I think we've got it. Okay, so this looks good. Okay, I'm happy. I'm
2:29:49
happy we've got this section. Fantastic. Okay, next section. We've got our partners section. Now, this section is a
2:29:58
little bit different. Uh, I think I've changed the, you know, the size of this page, but basically what we have here,
2:30:04
whoa, is we've got these, um, top lines that
2:30:10
basically go across the page. They're not as the container stopping here. They
2:30:16
basically run through left to right all the way. Um, and they have this gradient
2:30:21
color. And then inside we've got this container with the partner logos. So,
2:30:27
let's see how we're going to do that. So, let's go ahead and I'm just going to duplicate again one section uh and just
2:30:35
delete the the product grid. So, we have a section with a container, but outside
2:30:41
of the container, I want to have this let's call this divider line. Okay. So,
2:30:47
let's bring in just like a normal div block um and put it in here. not inside
2:30:53
of the container, but actually before the container, on top of the container. And I'm going to call this divider line.
2:31:01
This divider line, what I want is I want this to go all the way 100% of the page. So I'm going to set here 100%. Height is
2:31:08
basically just two pixels. So I'm going to set 2 px. And note the interesting
2:31:13
thing. Sometimes you can use relative sizing like 100%. Sometimes you can use fixed and exact sizing like 2 pixels. So
2:31:20
that's interesting. And when it comes to the background then here we want to
2:31:27
actually set this as a gradient. So let's go here and create a gradient. Now we actually have to try and duplicate
2:31:34
the gradient that we have here which is let's go ahead and do this. So the first one I'm going to copy the color here
2:31:40
from the hex value. So this one this is the hex value here. And then kind of
2:31:47
like a little bit down the line we have this blue. So, I'm going to add another gradient stop here and paste that as the
2:31:55
blue. Hey, wait. This didn't pass. I see. Some reason the colors don't
2:32:03
stick. Okay, let's do that. Let's try that again. Purplish on the left.
2:32:12
Should have hit return. Uh, and now it's working. And now let's pick this greenish color. Let's add that right
2:32:19
here. as another gradient stop. Hit return to save that.
2:32:26
Last one is yellow. Not last one before the last is yellow.
2:32:32
And the last one is actually I don't know I have to call this orang-ish.
2:32:38
All right. So the last one is the orang-ish. Okay. So now we've got this linear gradient. Now it's difficult to
2:32:44
see but I'm going to hit here play so that nah it's difficult to see right now. So we're going to see this. This is
2:32:50
a really thin line that we have. And let's duplicate that um before the
2:32:55
container and after the container. So, copy that. And we have divider line before the container, not inside the
2:33:01
container. But one of them is before the container. And the other one is Yeah.
2:33:06
Okay. So, I think that's right. We probably should also have spacing, a little bit of spacing between that and
2:33:12
the container. So, let's add the divider line. Let's add maybe um 50 pixels to
2:33:20
the bottom and see if that's okay. Okay, so we've got that in here in this
2:33:28
container. What do we want? Want probably something similar, I think, to what we have here. This is centered uh
2:33:35
and we've got some things inside. So, let's let's try and copy what we have
2:33:40
here at the top. We've got this mission text. Let's copy this whole element and
2:33:46
see if that works. If I put it in here, it is not centered, I guess, because
2:33:53
here I I set the centered on the mission block and not on the uh mission text
2:33:59
element. But I can go ahead and pick this and center this as well. Uh let's
2:34:04
copy. What do we need here? Here we just need our partners. So we don't need the new area. We can paste this in here. And
2:34:12
here we want to bring in the logos. So, let's start bringing in the logos. We've got the logos here. So, I'm going to
2:34:18
drag first one here actually after the partners.
2:34:25
And then actually, let's copy and paste this three times and just change the
2:34:30
image this way. Replace image. I'm going to pick this image. Uh, you can see that
2:34:35
the image it doesn't look exactly how we want this to look so far. Okay. So, I've
2:34:40
got these three images. First of all, I think I need to make them a little bit smaller. So, let's call this partner
2:34:48
logo. And I think I'm going to apply this partner logo partner logo to all of them
2:34:55
so that I can have consistent sizing to all of them. Okay. And now let's do
2:35:00
something like height of let's see what happens if I make 40 pixels. I don't know if it's too small. Yeah, it's a
2:35:06
little bit too small. You can see it right here at the bottom. Um,
2:35:12
I think that 90 pixels is great. And I'm going to give it spacing. And I'm going
2:35:18
to hit uh alt or sorry, option to make this uh equal on both sides. I'm going
2:35:25
to make sure that they're spaced out. Now, because this mission text is bounding them at um 510,
2:35:33
it's a little bit too small. So, let's actually to this mission text, let's actually add a combo class, additional
2:35:40
class, and we'll call this uh partners logo um container
2:35:48
and just this one. So, it's inheriting a lot of the properties of the mission text that we have above, but this one is
2:35:54
a little bit different. And the way that it's going to be different is that this is a little bit longer. And now, yeah,
2:36:00
the text, the the logos can fit nicely this way. I also think that they need a
2:36:06
little bit of space from in the top from this partners. So, let's add a little
2:36:11
bit of a margin at the top and maybe also at the bottom so that there's nice
2:36:17
spacing between that and the other line that we have here at the bottom. Okay. So I think that our partners uh section
2:36:26
is great and now we can continue to our last section almost last section which
2:36:32
is just a simple two column right so I think we can use the same layout as the first section let's go ahead and
2:36:39
duplicate our first section our hero section copy and paste and bring the
2:36:45
copy down below and we don't need an image and we don't need we actually do need an H2 that says
2:36:52
contact us. So I'm going to copy that here. I don't need this pioneers. Um now
2:37:00
we need a form. So Webflow already has a form for us. Readymade form. We can go
2:37:05
here and see form block. Let's drag that in here and see what it looks like. It
2:37:12
does have name and email address. In our case, we also want a message. So let's
2:37:17
see if we have here under the form. We do have a text area. So I can bring in
2:37:22
another one, another text area. And let's see how this is structured. So this this is a special element because
2:37:28
obviously there's a logic to what happens when you submit a form and stuff like that. So we do need to see how it's
2:37:35
structured. There's a form block here. Everything is nested inside a form element. And there's label and the field
2:37:41
label and a field. And then we've added another text area. Let's bring in another text field so that we can say uh
2:37:49
the last one is a message actually. But actually, you know what? I can see that for us uh we're not using this label. Um
2:37:57
we're actually using this as maybe the placeholder text for it because you can see that in the text field, if I go here
2:38:03
into the settings, we can have a placeholder um some placeholder text. You can see
2:38:09
right here. So here I'm going to actually put a name name. And you can see that now we have a placeholder
2:38:16
inside of this field. So I actually don't need this. Don't need the email address. But in this field, I'm going to
2:38:23
set the placeholder to email. And this one I don't need, but this one,
2:38:29
by the way, this one, we didn't give this a name. Now, this is when it comes to forms, the naming of the form in the
2:38:34
settings is important because again, you're going to send this message in an email. And basically this is how it you
2:38:41
know when the client is going to get hey you got a message they need to know what area did they fill this in. So in this
2:38:48
case this is the message. I'm going to change the name here to the message and the placeholder text to message. Okay.
2:38:56
Now we also want this to be how long is this? You can see here this
2:39:02
has the width of let's say 400 pixels. So let's go here into the form. Let's add a class here from the styling panel
2:39:09
class of form and set the width to 400 pixels. Okay,
2:39:15
that looks great. All of these elements, let's call this form uh field
2:39:22
field. We want to style them a little bit. We want to give them this gray color. So,
2:39:28
I'm going to pick this color and I'm going to go here into background color and I'm going to paste in the color and
2:39:34
hit return. And also round corners, right? So where are the
2:39:40
round corners? Radius 30 pixels. That looks great. And let's go ahead and
2:39:45
apply that. Maybe make them a little bit chubbier by adding a little bit more padding. Um
2:39:51
yeah, I think that that looks good. And we can go ahead and apply the same class that we have for this form field. We can
2:39:58
do it here. So form field, I can just pick it here. And form field, I can pick that one here.
2:40:05
And this looks great. What we want actually I want more spacing for the
2:40:10
form. So this whole form element which we've created a class for I can add a little bit of spacing at the top. So
2:40:17
let's do 50 and I'll be happy about that. Um we can go ahead and style this
2:40:23
button. So this is a submit button. It has this purplish color. So let's give
2:40:28
this a class of submit button. And what do we want here? Background color.
2:40:34
Change the blue to this. Change the text actually from white to
2:40:41
black. And round corners. Give this 30. Also
2:40:47
want to make this a little bit bigger. So I'm going to add a little bit more padding this way and from top to bottom
2:40:53
to make the uh the button a little bit more chubby, I guess. Also maybe make
2:40:59
the text a little bit bigger. So 16 16 and maybe make it semi-bold. I think
2:41:06
that's what we had here. Okay. So I like that. Okay. Second column. This is an
2:41:11
H3. We didn't have an H3 yet. Let's go ahead and copy this into this cell and
2:41:16
change that from Hey, is this H1? No, I didn't want this to be H1. This was
2:41:22
supposed to be H2. Sorry, this is also H1. No, this is H2. Okay, I forgot that
2:41:28
I've copied the hero section which had had an H1. So, it's a good thing that I caught that and changed that to H2. And
2:41:34
this needs to be H3 which we haven't styled yet. So, let's go ahead and style the H3. What is the size of this? This
2:41:41
is 35. Okay, so saffron 35
2:41:48
and let's do investors contact.
2:41:53
Investors contact. So, what do we have here? So here we have two things. Basically, we need to create this kind
2:41:59
of like link that when you're clicking on this, it's going to send you to the
2:42:04
email. So let's go ahead and basically what I'm going to do is create I need a
2:42:09
normal box that you know a div that can include the the image. However, I also
2:42:16
want this to be linkable. So we have a link block here and I'm going to drag it here. And let's call this email button.
2:42:23
email button. Now, this email button, first of all, has um this gray
2:42:30
background to it. So, let's copy the gray background. And under the background, I'm going to give this
2:42:37
fantastic. I also want to bring in inside the email icon. So, let's bring in the email icon. drag it inside
2:42:45
and well doesn't have any spacing uh between the edges of the email button
2:42:52
and you know the icon itself. So let's add a little bit of padding. So now we have this but it's a box. We need this
2:42:59
to look like a circle. Let's go here and give this like a ridiculous number of uh radius color uh radius uh
2:43:08
round corners like 500. Okay. So now this has become a circle. This looks
2:43:13
pretty good actually. Um, we can also give the H3 a little bit of spacing from
2:43:19
the bottom. Uh, just so that we have a little bit more space here. Okay. And
2:43:25
this is now a link by the way. So, we can go here into the setting and determine what happens when somebody
2:43:30
clicks this link. And you can see that we can either go to a website or we can go to a page in the website. In this
2:43:35
case, this is an email, right? So, let me copy the email here and just place it
2:43:41
here. email and what is the subject? Maybe email from website.
2:43:49
Okay. So now this is actually a functional button and you know by this point actually we already we can
2:43:55
actually make these buttons functional as well. So these buttons what we want them to do is we want them to scroll
2:44:02
down into a section. Now the way that we do this is we need to give this section a name so that we can say hey this is
2:44:08
the mission section. So when you click here, it's going to connect to it. The way I'm going to do this is you can see
2:44:14
from the settings panel, I can give it an idea. Let's call this mission. Uh let's go into this section and call it
2:44:22
product. Pro product. And let's go into this section and call this contact.
2:44:29
Contact. Now, if I'm going back into my links here and from the settings panel, you
2:44:35
can see I can select to a page section. And now we already have a bunch of
2:44:41
things here like contact. Now we can also refer to the the emails and stuff like that. Those are not really
2:44:47
relevant. But what I want them I I want mission. The section that is called mission. This one I want to go to the
2:44:55
section that is called product. And this one to the section that is called
2:45:00
contact. So if I'm going to preview this right now and click mission, you can see
2:45:05
that we're now scrolling to the right place. and product. We're scrolling into the right place. Contact, we're
2:45:11
scrolling into the right place. Okay. So, things are working. And this is great. I do want to Yeah. Okay. The last
2:45:18
thing that we need to do is bring in this email here as a text link as well.
2:45:24
So, let me go ahead and do a text link as well and bring it here and paste in
2:45:30
this email. Now, um,
2:45:35
one thing we need to do is to style this. So, let's call this email link.
2:45:40
And let's make sure by default links are blue. This is kind of like ' 90s websites if you remember. Uh, we want
2:45:47
this to actually be black. So, let's go ahead and pick black. Um, and we want
2:45:52
this to be bigger. Don't remember how big we wanted this to be. 25. So 25
2:45:59
enter normal. Let's do 25. Now we also want this to be next to this email
2:46:06
button. Uh and by default again kind of like a word processor. It's just putting this in the next breaking into the next
2:46:14
line. So to organize them together one next to each other again we're going to need to wrap them so that we can handle
2:46:21
them together. Now previously we've added the div and then added these two elements into a div. But there's
2:46:26
actually a faster way to do that because this is such a common thing in web design. If I'm going to rightclick this, you can see that Web Flow allows us to
2:46:32
wrap them in a div block. So, I'm going to add this div block and I'm just going to bring in the email link. So, now
2:46:40
they're wrapped together. And you can see that now they're also one next to each other. But I do want to manage the
2:46:46
spacing between them. So, let me call this email block. Email block. Now, what
2:46:52
I'm going to do is I'm going to change the layout of this uh email block into
2:46:58
from display. You can see the basic is a block and I'm going to change this into a flexbox. Now, this is a super super
2:47:04
powerful tool. I'm not going to get into how to handle this right now on this course, but what I will show you is that
2:47:09
I'm able to manage how they are aligned and how much spacing there is between them. So, I'm going to add a bunch of
2:47:15
space here. And now we that that works. And this link, by the way, uh we didn't
2:47:20
manage what this link does. So, right here, I'm going to change this to an email as well. Paste the email in here.
2:47:27
Uh message from website, similar to what we did in the link before. Okay, that's
2:47:34
it. The only thing that we have left to do is to add the footer section, which is going to be a little bit different,
2:47:40
right? We don't need uh we need a background here. This gradient background, actually, you know what? So,
2:47:47
here's what I want to do. I want to find a way to reuse the gradient that I've created here. Um, because it took us a
2:47:55
while to create this gradient color, right? It was kind of like tedious. So,
2:48:00
here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to add, let me collapse everything that's going on here. Let's add a new section. Uh,
2:48:08
sometimes it's uh difficult to add a new section. So, let's go ahead and actually and copy and paste the last one. uh
2:48:15
delete the container because we don't need it in this section. We want it to have actually a
2:48:21
background. Um let me see if I can go ahead and this
2:48:28
gradient that we have here. Trying to figure out if there's an easy
2:48:33
way to save it. No, I guess not. Okay. So, although it's tedious, I'm going to
2:48:39
have to recreate this gradient here as a background. So what we want is to add an
2:48:45
additional class on top of the section because this is not a regular section. Let's add footer section so that we can
2:48:52
manipulate the background. So I have this gradient although it's going from top to bottom. And so I'm going to need
2:48:59
to change the angle here to maybe 90°. Um and probably you know what I probably
2:49:05
can't see this because this divider line was too uh too small for me to see so far. Probably I need to change it here
2:49:11
as well so that we can see the gradient on this divider line as well. Um, and we
2:49:17
need to give the footer a little bit of well a little bit of spacing padding top
2:49:22
to bottom. And we're going to need to add a little bit of text. So, let's add the text block here. Um, copy this
2:49:30
copyrights thing. Well, close this gradient. Copy the copyrights thing.
2:49:37
Put it in here. Um, and so the the footer, let's select the footer, the
2:49:43
section, footer section. Let's make sure that the text is aligned center. Let's add a little bit of padding from top and
2:49:50
bottom so that this thing is spaced out a little bit. And I think yeah, I think it looks good.
2:49:56
Okay, so the website is basically built, but it's built for desktop. And the next
2:50:03
thing that we're going to do is we're going to make sure that it's responsive and it looks great on all breakpoints.
2:50:08
So I've already showed you that here at the top I can pick to see different break points on how the website is going
2:50:14
to look like you know on a tablet or on a mobile. And as you can see things do
2:50:19
not look great at this point. Here's an important things before the basically
2:50:24
what we're going to do the process is we're going to start looking at them and fix the stylings because and that's the
2:50:30
important thing that I wanted you to know is that when we make changes to styling at smaller break points they're
2:50:36
going to that these changes are going to cascade down into an even smaller break points but they're not going to affect
2:50:42
the decision that we've made for bigger break points for the um desktop for example. So, let's go ahead now that
2:50:49
we're in tablet and try to fix to make sure that things look okay. Now, the
2:50:55
first thing that I'm seeing is that we didn't manage the spacing. You know, we want to have you can't really read text
2:51:01
when it's touching the edges. So, we want to make sure that there's always space between or a little bit of inner
2:51:08
padding inside of our section. So, I'm actually going to go back here. Now here it's difficult to see because the my
2:51:14
screen size at the moment is exactly gives us like a really nice space here from left and right. But as you can see
2:51:20
if the screen is smaller there's actually no way to force in this space. So what I want to do is I want to go and
2:51:27
select our normal section class that applies to all of our section in our website. And I'm just going to add
2:51:34
basically 20 pixels of space, maybe even 30 pixels of space from left and right.
2:51:42
So that no matter what the screen size is, there's always 30 pixels of space. So now as I'm starting to go down into
2:51:49
break points, you can see that this really gives us already a pretty solid spacing from left and right. uh for some
2:51:56
reason not not for some reason but this does not apply into the uh header because the navbar because the navbar is
2:52:02
not a section. So I'm actually just going to go here into the navbar and separately add this to the navbar. Sorry
2:52:08
20 that was sorry just going to hit option to make sure that it's 30 from
2:52:15
left and right. Okay. So okay already things start to look better. Now we have to start making
2:52:22
decisions on how we actually want this to look. So the first thing that we note is that navigation turned into this uh
2:52:28
hamburger menu which we can go into the settings and click show to see how it looks. So basically it's great but it's
2:52:35
ugly. I don't want this uh grayness to it. So let's go ahead and style this. I'm going to uh this is called menu
2:52:42
button. I'm going to add a class menu button. Really don't know why Web Flow
2:52:47
decided that it's going to be great idea to turn that into a gray. Um, let's go
2:52:53
here and select white background. Um, I do want white background. However, I
2:53:01
want the the actual text here to be black. So, the icon, I want this to be
2:53:07
black. And I'm changing the background. I wonder why I'm changing the background into white. Okay, that looks great. So,
2:53:13
and also here on the nav link, they all of a sudden um, no, actually not. The nav links are inside of this nav menu.
2:53:22
Let's give this a class nav menu that also has by default this gray ugly
2:53:27
background. So I'm going to change that into white. Actually, we can do something nicer here. We can do white
2:53:33
and reduce the opacity just a tiny little bit and maybe
2:53:38
go here below and do um backdrop filter blur. And now you can see that, you
2:53:46
know, we have a little bit of transparency. We have this glass effect where it's opening up and we can see the
2:53:51
background blurred a little bit in the background. I actually think this is a nice nice design. Okay. So, I'm going to
2:53:57
go ahead and close it. Now, as I've mentioned earlier, sometimes the designer or you will make these
2:54:02
decisions in Figma in the previous design stage. In this case, I'm just going to basically try to figure it out
2:54:08
as I go. The next thing I want is I want to have and for this navbar I also want a little
2:54:15
bit more spacing between the next section uh here. So I'm just going to add a tiny bit of bottom margin here. 30
2:54:24
pixels bottom margin just so that we have more space. Now I can ask myself whether I still want this layout of two
2:54:32
columns. Um, and I think I c I do want on tablet, but I think that this text is
2:54:38
just the heading is way too big for this break point. So, I'm going to go into the heading one and change it from 50 to
2:54:46
maybe 40. Uh, 40 is still big. Still quite big. 35.
2:54:53
Yeah, I think that looks that looks better. Okay. So, I'm going to keep it at 35. I'm going to decrease the line
2:55:00
height. Um, yeah, I think this looks this looks much better. Now, if I've
2:55:05
made the change to H1, if H1 is now 35, then this one H2 should probably be
2:55:11
something like 30 because we want it to be smaller than that. Uh, and maybe this
2:55:16
subheading will reduce it from 16 to maybe 14. Okay, maybe we need to adjust
2:55:22
the spacing between them as well. Um, can reduce this to zero. And here for
2:55:29
the H2, we can reduce this to zero and this one to 10 pixels. Okay, so already
2:55:38
things are starting to look much better. Now here, look at how this looks like. Uh first of
2:55:45
all, the image is not centered. So let's go here into our um background. Let's go
2:55:52
and see the background. Click that. You can see that the image is positioned to be fixed to the top left corner. Let's
2:55:59
actually go ahead and center it. And now I think it looks much better. Okay. So, first section looks okay. Second section
2:56:05
also looks okay right now. This section, second section.
2:56:11
Um, I'm not happy with how this looks like. So I think that
2:56:16
when it comes to this break point, maybe what I want is
2:56:23
for this cell here um to basically span across
2:56:28
maybe span across this whole um let me see how I'm thinking about this.
2:56:36
[Music] So I've got this cell and
2:56:42
let's do in the cell size column will span three columns. Okay. So now the
2:56:48
first one is spanning all three columns or maybe two columns. Okay. This is actually better. It's spanning three
2:56:54
columns. And here it would actually look better I think if it's just three rows. So let's
2:57:00
instead of this spanning two columns, let's select this second cell. Let's
2:57:07
have this span one. Um, no, no, no, no, no, no. This one
2:57:13
should be row row number two.
2:57:18
Okay, so let's go back to this. Let's make sure that this spans three columns and this is great. So, this cell is
2:57:25
going to span one and this is spanning
2:57:30
one. But this is this cell is bigger.
2:57:36
Why is it bigger? Ah, because it was exactly this was one
2:57:41
FR and these were two FR. Okay. So, now I think this is better. This is a better layout. So, as you can see, I'm figuring
2:57:47
it out as I go. I'm trying to make sure that it looks good. One thing that I'm also noting is that the 50 uh uh pixels
2:57:57
uh spacing between these columns is a little bit big here. Here, I'm going to change this to 30. Yeah, I think this
2:58:02
spacing looks a little bit better at this point. Logos. Okay, so the logos
2:58:08
here, I think they have too much space between them, so they don't fit in one line. So, I'm going to reduce that. That
2:58:15
looks great. Uh, this is for some reason uh what's going on here is too big. And
2:58:21
I guess it's because this form I'm forcing it to be 400 pixels. Let's make that much smaller. Uh actually maybe
2:58:29
make it auto so that it has um yeah so that it has or just 100%
2:58:38
maybe 100% of this column. Well I'm going to keep
2:58:43
it that way. This is probably we're going to make this much smaller. So let's turn that to 20. We've got more
2:58:51
space. Now we can also decrease the spacing in this email block which was
2:58:56
30. Let's reduce that. So now things starting to look good. Even the two
2:59:02
column grid here, by the way, which has this 50 pixels. We wanted to reduce that
2:59:07
to 30 pixels. Okay. So now things are spaced out much better. Footer looks
2:59:12
good. Okay. So looking at this, the tablet looks decent at this point. Let's
2:59:18
continue to this mobile breakpoint. This doesn't make sense at this point.
2:59:24
So I'm going to go ahead and say okay when it comes to mobile for this um
2:59:31
actually yeah when it comes to mobile let's make sure that this is not two columns let's
2:59:37
delete this column just make it one column okay so that looks like this and
2:59:42
the next images below already looks much better okay this
2:59:47
also looks good but you know we're basically saying that this has a maximum
2:59:53
width width of uh 510. In mobile it does not make sense. In mobile maybe we can
2:59:59
just make it like 90%. Okay. And that would look good.
3:00:06
I'm trying to think whether I think for that for mobile this image is just too tall. Now it looks good on our screen
3:00:12
but you have to remember that mobile landscape modal is actually going to be very very tight. So let's actually go
3:00:18
ahead and reduce. And it's also going to enable us to see more of the image. So I'm going to
3:00:24
reduce the height of this mission block. Okay. So this looks good. This also
3:00:29
looks good. But maybe these um top lab images which we defined as height of 290
3:00:36
pixels, we can also make them smaller and we can see more of the image that way. So this now looks great.
3:00:44
Now, these logos are not going to fit. Um, yeah, one next to each other, unless
3:00:49
I make them a little bit smaller, which I can do. I can make them a little bit smaller. I can reduce the space between
3:00:55
them even more. And that looks good. This looks good. Just this H3, actually,
3:01:00
this H3, we didn't make it smaller. Um, we didn't make it smaller. We should
3:01:05
have probably made it like 28 at this point. Um, it also has a lot of space at the
3:01:12
top. So, let's remove that so that everything aligns.
3:01:19
And now I'm trying to figure out, okay, so we can't fit or these together unless
3:01:25
I make this um, and by the way, this is a two call grid. So maybe why are we
3:01:31
still trying to force it into two columns? Can be this way and then this way. So now it looks better. Now it
3:01:39
looks much better. Okay, last one is mobile portrait. And I think that at
3:01:46
this point, okay, the logo is too big. So let's go ahead and select the logo which we've defined as 250. Let's at
3:01:54
this point, let's make it 200. And here I think can be even 180.
3:02:02
Um, okay. So that looks good. Maybe the spacing here is a little bit
3:02:08
too big, the padding that I created. But is the text here too big on mobile? On
3:02:16
this mobile portrait, usually when you will have one word per line, that tells you that the text is too big, right? So,
3:02:23
you need to make it a little bit smaller. So, let's go ahead and reduce this to maybe 30.
3:02:29
Uh, not 20, maybe 28. Nah, still too big. 27.
3:02:36
Okay, 27 is decent. It looks more readable that way. Um, we
3:02:43
do have a lot of spacing here. Um,
3:02:50
so maybe let's reduce the gap to 20. Yeah, I think it it's more makes more sense with a little bit less space.
3:02:56
Also, each one of our sections has remember 50 pixels um spacing from at
3:03:03
the bottom. That would space it from the next section. I can change that to maybe not 20, maybe 30.
3:03:11
Okay. So, first section looks great. Uh, this is a little problematic right now.
3:03:18
First of all, I can reduce the top space so that the text comes here.
3:03:24
Uh, I wonder if we make it smaller. I guess maybe I think I'm going
3:03:31
to have to make this higher just so that the text does not fall on his face. So
3:03:36
I'm playing around with this. I think this all at this point this looks good.
3:03:42
This we need to make them even smaller here. So let's make them a bit smaller.
3:03:48
And we can make the space between them even smaller. Maybe like 15.
3:03:55
Um, I wonder if we need to make them now
3:04:01
bigger. Um, just going to keep it this way. The logos at this point are very small.
3:04:08
So, I'm not going to try to even force them into a single line. I think I'm
3:04:14
just going to keep it this way. And that looks okay. Contact H.
3:04:20
This huge uh button here is just too big at this point. Um maybe let's reduce the
3:04:31
reduce the spacing here and make this smaller. So I'm trying to see if we can
3:04:36
fit it. We can fit everything here. And I guess we can. I guess we can.
3:04:44
This can also be a little bit smaller. Okay. Um, where's the text size? Let's
3:04:51
turn this into 20. Okay. Okay. So, we've managed and reviewed all
3:05:00
the different break points. And now we can see that even if I'm changing to a random breakpoint, things will look
3:05:07
okay. So, that's it. We're basically there. All we need to do right now is hit the publish button and then hit
3:05:14
publish to select domain. Now you can see as I'm building this website and so
3:05:19
far I didn't have to pay for anything, right? Web flow gives us a free domain which in this case is massebsite.webflow.io.
3:05:26
And I'm going to click here. This is already a live website. It's working. It has a domain name. You can go ahead and
3:05:33
try it out on yourself. People can find this website. Right now we have a live website. Okay. Now, of course, if you're
3:05:40
not paying Web Flow and stuff like that, it's hosted on their domain. So, they're going to probably put a badge. This is
3:05:46
hosted. This is a Web Flow website. And you obviously you don't want this for your client's website. So, the last
3:05:51
thing that I have to do is to actually connect this to a custom domain. You can see I can do here add a custom domain.
3:05:59
This would require me to purchase a hosting um a hosting plan and of course
3:06:04
for my clients to purchase their own domain. So, I'm going to do this later on. We're not going to go into this
3:06:09
right now. If you want to see how to do this, I'm going to send you extra resources. Web will have great resources
3:06:15
on how to connect domains. But we're basically there now. Of course, we can add more interactions and animations to
3:06:22
make more wow into this. But I think for the scope of this course, I think we've
3:06:27
got pretty pretty far. It's time to show your client the final website. Showing
3:06:32
the website to your client and having a positive reaction is one of the best feelings in the world. Now, honestly, I'm getting comments on YouTube and from
3:06:39
our students like, "You've changed my life." And while these make me feel great, there's actually no high like the
3:06:46
one that you're getting when your client is just loving the work that you did for them. That is an incredible feeling. And
3:06:53
while, you know, money is also an important factor when you're choosing what you do for a living, I have to tell
3:06:58
you that I am addicted to this feeling of like wowing your client. All right,
3:07:05
so that's it. We designed and we developed a website and I hope you learned a lot on this course and I hope
3:07:12
that you're following along this process and trying to work this out with your own either project or a client. Let me
3:07:18
know in the comment and when you're ready to dive into web design and do it professionally, I do hope to see you in
3:07:24
one of our premium courses. The mentors, the community and me are all waiting for you there. See you soon.



-------


in this free web design course you'll learn  every step of the professional web design   process and you'll build a full project along  with me we're going to start with strategy and  
0:09
structure and we're going to move into the full  design phase and even develop the website without   writing a single line of code you're going to  get a complete crash course in professional  
0:19
web design the techniques like wireframing and  color theory the tools of the trade like figma  
0:25
and framer and some tips and tricks that I've learned along the way over my 18   year design career you're going to be building a  project along with me so it's not going to be a  
0:34
bunch of theory but practical applications so that  by the time you're done with this free course you  
0:40
can design and publish simple websites for paying  clients all right let's dive into this web design  
0:49
course starting by talking about the process  because there's a lot of different processes   and ways in which you can design and sell websites  and if we think about it like a spectrum maybe  
The Process
1:00
one far end of the spectrum you have really low  impact cheap customizable templates that you can  
1:06
sell for anywhere between $500 and $1,500 that's  a totally different method and process that we're  
1:12
not going to focus on in this course because it  lacks any sort of customization and it also is not  
1:18
going to really bring you the type of Revenue most  likely to be a very successful or renowned web  
1:23
designer on the other far end of the spectrum you  have really high ticket offerings we're talking  
1:28
six figures multiple six figure requirement websites so we're talking about a website  
1:34
that cost $150 to $200,000 High Enterprise  year-long projects it's going to be very very  
1:39
draining and with both of these far ends of  the spectrum it's not going to be the common   method that most freelance web designers are  going to experience so in this course I want  
1:49
to focus more on a middleof the road method or  process this is going to be a custom process a  
1:56
professional process you are going to be doing  the design work doing the ual work doing the   ux work but we're also going to lean on some established patterns and some tools  
2:05
and tips and tricks to help speed that process so  somewhere in this range that we're talking about   today you could expect to sell websites to clients  for anywhere between 10 and $30,000 and that the  
2:17
project time might run anywhere between a month  and 3 months that's a pretty solid and I feel like  
2:24
roundabout you know run-ofthe-mill process for  a good client a good project a good port folio  
2:30
piece and good Revenue to make and this process  that we're going to lay out here can really be   broken into four parts number one that's strategy  which consists really of a lot of conversations a  
2:41
lot of questions a client questionnaire we'll  talk about here in a moment part number two is  
2:46
the structure where you're going to do information  architecture and ux design we're going to be doing  
2:52
a bunch of wireframing sketches and structure kind  of stuff number three is the design process where  
2:58
you're going to do color and user interface  typography we're going to build mood boards   and style tiles and then part four is going to be the development phase where we're actually going  
3:06
to bring everything into framer and we'll rapidly  build our website in a no code tool like framer  
3:12
and then press that big blue publish button we  will have a live functioning website so with  
3:17
that being said let's dive in now to the strategy  portion you have to understand that you're really   trying to answer three main questions it is  what do they need who are their competitors and  
Strategy
3:29
how will we solve their problem let's start with  that first question of what do they need and you  
3:35
can really boil this down no matter who it  is to probably three categories there's lots   of different types of websites different types of  clients Ecommerce portfolio you know marketplaces  
3:47
whatever it is all of those it doesn't matter  what type of client or website it is it usually   boils down to one of the three following reasons  or Solutions they're coming to you for they have a  
3:58
problem and it's probably either one of the three  number one sales they're looking for increased   Revenue more sales to get sales started to double sales it has to do with revenue and money  
4:08
that is the number one reason or the number one  type of problem that you will have to learn how  
4:13
to solve through your web design process number  two problem that you might run into is traffic  
4:19
they're just looking for more leads more traffic  more notoriety more visibility online because  
4:24
all of that traffic and leads subscribers  followers whatever it is probably later  
4:29
on will convert to sales and lastly there  is such a thing as the vanity metric they   want to showcase something they want to share  something to the world and that's okay to for a  
4:39
client to want to stroke their own ego and their  vanity sometimes you want to show up online show   your portfolio but I will say that whether  it's a vanity metric or a traffic metric most  
4:49
of the time it will eventually at some point  lead back to sales if you have a client that  
4:54
comes to you and says that they want something  else besides these three things they just want   to website CU their friend told them that's not going to be a good client and this is not  
5:03
going to be the right process for them you're  either going to waste their money they're going   to be frustrated or you're not going to be  able to solve their problem because they  
5:09
haven't identified a problem and just needing  a website is a very subjective thing but an  
5:14
objective goal or thing for you to accomplish is  to increase any of those metrics we've already  
5:20
talked about so with that said how do you find  this information what do they need I quite   often use something called a client survey I have  this in fig but I also have a pdf version you can  
5:31
download if you want this is for a website project  and really we're just trying to figure out what do   you need what are you really after who are your  users and what are they trying to do and I've  
5:39
broken this down into three pieces here one is the  past we'll ask them some general information about   who they are and what's their current assessment  of their website and what are the problems and  
5:49
objectives the problems they have with their maybe previous website or no website   and what would they like their objectives to be  how do we want to measure success and you should  
5:58
walk your clients through a document like this one  so that there's a lot of clarity so that you are  
6:03
aligning on vision and Mission and success metrics  for this project once you get the past stuff you  
6:10
can start digging into the present who are your  users what are their goals what's the perception   of you and your business online is there some  sort of differentiator maybe you're the cheapest  
6:19
one or the fastest one or the coolest one whatever  it is and then we start talking about content   structure and then after that we want to talk  about the future why is it necessary describe  
6:29
things for us we're going to help kind of do a  little bit of brand tone work to establish what we   need to do in the future and what's the technology  stack that it's on and who's going to be  
6:38
maintaining and governing the website project now  I know a lot about my current client because he's  
6:44
a friend of mine so I can answer a lot of this probably off the top of my head but for you you're   going to need to spend the time with your client  walking through this document another quick note  
6:53
here if your client does not have the time to help  you understand this information they're probably   not a good client and you probably don't want  to work with them they are probably wanting to  
7:03
operate somewhere in that cheap fast template kind  of place but for clients who really really want  
7:08
to have an impact they know their goal Revenue  traffic vanity then a process like this is going  
7:14
to be highly valuable to them so I can tell you  personally for our project which is my friend  
7:20
who runs a tattoo website or a tattoo studio  his problem is that a his old website stopped  
7:27
functioning and the the primary objective of that  old website was to get people into a contact form  
7:33
to get him new potential leads those leads  actually generate Revenue when they become not  
7:39
just cold leads or warm leads but hot leads and he  can actually book them take their deposit get them  
7:45
scheduled for an appointment so that's really his objective his people his clientele his customer  
7:51
base are people usually who are visiting from  out of town and looking to establish or set up   an appointment for the future so as I walk through  this can understand the general information I know  
8:01
who he is his current assessment is bad because  his website's not functioning and the problems  
8:07
and objectives really are that that old contact  form method never really worked great anyways we   want to do better we want to increase sales and  increase traffic so there's probably going to be  
8:16
some SEO elements to this project that are beyond  the scope of this course but the website needs to   look dope it needs to look amazing it needs to  be enticing needs to communicate very clearly  
8:26
the people coming from out of town what they're  looking for so that's things already happening in   my mind around SEO copy design style I'm already  starting to understand who his current clients are  
8:37
and how I can service them better and his goals  are really to have a functioning website that uh   really brings people into his sales funnel a lot more efficiently and he wants to be really  
8:48
seen as a safe professional environment for people  and he has some content that we're going to build  
8:53
on the idea is to really be that safe secure  Dependable professional person in the industry  
9:00
for years and years and technology is going to be  very very big for him because he had his old site   built on WordPress it got malware the whole thing  was hard for him to manage he needed to update  
9:10
his website so we're going to move him to a much  more modern hosted secure platform that he can  
9:15
update things on like framer that allows us to  build the website very very quickly because he   is going to be the one governing and maintaining  the website that's a little bit of the strategy  
9:25
that's that first question what do they need  then we start asking the question who are their  
9:30
competitors now I will tell you that this is the  time for you to get online and start searching the  
9:36
their about their competitors doing what we call  competitive analysis or competitive set I know him  
9:42
really well so usually I might ask the client to give me a starter but I know this industry well  
9:47
obviously because I have tattoos and I've been  around tattoo artists a lot so I know that in his   industry that tat artists notoriously have bad  websites so looking directly in the competitor  
9:59
space or doing a competitive set is going  to surface a lot of really bad examples   of people who are doing things poorly  so what I would ask him instead is what  
10:08
are the things you like about some of those  competitors and why and he told me he liked  
10:13
uh the contact form he liked how there was a lot of photos he liked certain things about the   photo gallery so people could see his portfolio  so I take all of those with a grain of salt and  
10:23
I think of better solutions for him so he told me  about their competitors but you should spend some  
10:29
time doing some research not only from what your  client tells you but from what you can find doing   your competitive set really what you're trying to  do is create an audit or an analysis here start  
10:39
to highlight the things that work and don't work  and you want to align those with tried and true   web design patterns things that we know works  really really well which would be clear call  
10:49
to action good headline sub headline a really  good hero section easy to have or easy to use  
10:54
navigation all of these things matter so figuring  out their comps and maybe in their industry and  
11:00
out of their industry is important but lastly  how will we solve all of this is under the  
11:05
guys or under the the pillar of strategy we're  going to do this with our client we're going  
11:10
to do this sometimes away from our client but we're going to present them with a good solution   and that quite often is when you really seal the  deal with your potential client is by sharing with  
11:21
them the plan that you have to solve all of their  problems over the coming month or couple of months  
11:28
um and really increase those sales traffic  or vanity metric that is where your proposal   comes in we're not going to do a proposal here  because that's outside the scope of a web design  
11:37
course but just know that the strategy happens  usually at the beginning of the project sometimes  
11:42
you're going to do initial basic strategy to land  the client but you're definitely going to have to   do more in-depth strategy when you get the client  solidify the client so you can understand how you  
11:52
can best serve the client next we're going to move  on to structure because that's really one of the   biggest pieces here is trying to understand the  structure of their website what are their needs  
Structure
12:00
how you going to put all of this into play  and to do that we're going to start building   out some wireframes and some site Maps the structure of website is really really  
12:09
important and it really equates to just a  couple of things number one a site map which   will be kind of a map of how the pages connect  and what type of content needs to go inside of  
12:19
those pages number two you're going to need some  content document we're going to use chat GPT and  
12:24
some AI tools to kind of help us with that and  then lastly you're going to have to start wire   framing a little bit and that's going to be  the actual content and how it goes on those  
12:34
individual pages that you can find inside of  that map let's visualize a little bit and talk   about a couple of different tools and ways that  we can start building out these site maps you can  
12:43
start with a simple big Jam file and we could  either sketch here and just write titles or we  
12:49
could drag shapes inside so if we instead just for  instance grab a square drag this inside we could  
12:56
put here a homepage and let's make sure we spell  that right and then we could lead that to another  
13:02
page maybe you know our main navigation items on here are like the about page let's see if we can  
13:09
type good today and you might have another one  that is the contact page and you might have  
13:16
another one that is the gallery or portfolio  page something like this this is kind of the  
13:23
idea of a sitemap we're just starting to map  things around and figure out what needs to go   where and they real appliable you know inside  of big Jam files we can also use a little bit  
13:33
of AI right here and we could ask it to uh  give us a site map for a tattoo website that  
13:44
includes that includes excuse me uh Pages for  gallery contact about me and a homepage and  
13:57
we could even add a little bit more on to this  prompt and say the goal of the site is to get  
14:04
customers to book okay and with that being said  why don't we try to generate a site map right  
14:11
here using figma's own kind of internal tools so  and we have a homepage and it tells us about me  
14:17
gallery contact and there's some sort of call  to action or decision Diamond here saying are  
14:23
you interested in a tattoo yes go to book now this is a little bit more of a user flow   diagram for uiux design like applications mobile  apps but it kind of gets the job done a little bit  
14:33
there's some other tools online that you might  want to use this one's called octopus. Doo and  
14:39
it is uh there's a free plan here where you can  start actually laying out different sitemaps for  
14:45
projects here and you can see that like not only  do you get like the actual page here like we could   call this the homepage but it'll actually give  you like visualizations of the sections maybe we  
14:55
have a header an introduction services and we  can come into the services page and add some  
15:00
details here um you can also move all of those  around a little bit just like by dragging and  
15:07
dropping and we can create new pages here and  it's just a a really simple easy way and you  
15:13
once you're done here if you want to you can  actually share this and get your your clients  
15:18
or your customers feedback by inviting them in  and they can start adding content this is just   one way where you can actually kind of manage some of the project but another great tool really  
15:28
pop tool online right now is called reloom reloom  is a way for you to generate really quick uh like  
15:36
s maps and also wireframes so for instance you  can come in here and start a new project and I  
15:42
can do kind of a similar prompt that I had back  in figma so just like this I'm going to paste  
15:48
this in uh and I'll just say a tattoo website  that includes Pages for gallery contact about  
15:53
me and a homepage and the goal of the site  is to get customers to book number of pages   will do one to five and let's generate the sitemap  now what's really cool about reloom is it's going  
16:03
to generate some of the copy that goes inside of  us some of the sections it's going to make those  
16:09
recommendations and then it's made the page  recommendations here as well we can actually   come in here and say generate content on all  of these and that actually gets us started  
16:19
quite a bit with that copy aspect of it and  if we like this we can actually click over to  
16:25
wireframes and you'll see that reloom is going to start generating some of those   wireframes now I said this is a custom process  and you might be saying what like you're just  
16:34
generating wireframes like that that's doesn't  that feels templated that doesn't feel like that  
16:39
expensive custom process but here's the truth a  lot of wireframes end up being the same we could  
16:46
spend all of our time drawing out wireframes  but this is where a lot of those tried and true   Solutions really actually kind of the rubber  meets the road right there's a lot of things  
16:56
that we can do from Custom but we don't  necessarily have have to do this from   Custom or start this from scratch and so with  this being said we could just use some of these  
17:06
and what's really cool is we can actually come  here and we can reshuffle some of the components   so if I click on for instance this header maybe  we don't like this header I can come in here and  
17:17
I can actually switch this header let's replace  the component and you can see there's an entire   list of headers here that I might be able to switch out like maybe something like this one  
17:26
that looks pretty good but again this is a very  common structure and pattern for us to be using  
17:32
in a website hero section so again there's no  need to really reinvent the wheel when that  
17:37
wheel is highly accessible and at the end of  the day this is not going to make or break or  
17:43
cheapen my process it's just going to speed  my process up quite a bit okay so let's say  
17:50
we like what we have going on here uh we have a  bunch of different styles and I'm just going to  
17:55
go through and make a couple of edits here and  why don't we replace some of the components there  
18:00
I like maybe more of the value propositions here  and again this is just the start I tend to start  
18:06
out with wire frames and when I get into the  design process I might see that they're not   quite right I'll tweak and change them I don't  live by them but I live close to them it's kind  
18:14
of like Pirates of the Caribbean they're  more like guidelines than they are strict   instructions that I must follow I don't like to paint by numbers I like to start  
18:23
out with something that gets the juices flowing  more than anything so we have some testimonials   I kind of think about that I'm like okay maybe  I want the testimonials closer to the top so I'm  
18:32
going to zoom out and just drag those up to the  top because I want my users to get here really  
18:37
quickly and see what really really matters  here and again like the value propositions   I feel like matter a little bit more so let's  just drag and drop those up above and we have  
18:47
like maybe an About Me section down here and  maybe like a booking section my client also  
18:53
wants to show his gallery and he also sells  like really cool custom high-end jewelry as  
18:58
like Hawaiian theme cuz he's in Hawaii so  I want to make sure that there's a space   for that as well so let's take a look at  this tattoo portfolio and just regenerate  
19:08
or replace the component I might do something  like that that looks pretty good and then I  
19:14
might copy and paste another version of it and  I might move this one up above and I might get  
19:21
rid of this section this one's not going to  be the tattoo portfolio but it's going to   be maybe a smaller kind of jewelry portfolio  and then yeah let's do some FAQs and then we  
19:32
have a bottom section now this works for me  and you can see we can now go through and do   this on all of the other Pages for the sake  of time so this is not a one week long video  
19:42
I'm just going to do the homepage and I think  this homepage looks pretty good I might make  
19:47
a few other little changes like for instance I  might change the type of testimonials that we  
19:53
can see here I might want to see a few more  at one time instead of only being able to see  
19:58
one maybe we'll do something like two at a  time or try one more time and do something  
20:04
like three at a time even cuz we want to get his  Yelp reviews in and look at that it's writing the   copy for us obviously we're going to replace  that with real testimonials um but this looks  
20:13
pretty good actually as I started to think about  it I'm like maybe just maybe we'll do something   a little bit cleaner something like that I don't know we'll figure that out in Design This starts  
20:22
to feel like a really really good structure  for me now from here what I can do is I can   grab this entire element here and check it out  I can just copy it directly to figma now reom  
20:33
works really really well with other platforms I  really like framer so I'm just going to pull the  
20:39
design directly from reom bring it into figma  and later on we'll do all our design work and   we'll push it into framer so I'm going to copy  to figma just like that and it tells me I  
20:48
need the reloom plugin installed let's go  back to figma really quickly and let's just  
20:55
make sure that I have the plug-in installed  which it looks like like for some reason I  
21:00
don't let's go to plugins like this and there  it is we're going to run it just like so and  
21:06
that's installing the plugin beautiful just like  that it looks like we had an Untitled project  
21:11
probably should title that project we could do  that but why don't we do this we're going to   click on it and we're going to uh we'll actually click in deeper and we'll just take the homepage  
21:21
we can add the entire sitemap and the wireframe  and again this is something you are going to   want to present to your clients as the structure  the information architecture and the wireframe  
21:32
so why don't we go ahead and just bring in  we'll go back here and we'll bring in the   entire site map like that it's going to bring  in everything we just did there beautiful we  
21:40
like that and then why don't we go into that  and just say I want the wireframe for the  
21:46
homepage now we could bring all of them in but  like I said we're only doing the homepage for   this particular project and you can see what  reloom is doing for us it's bringing in a bunch  
21:57
of that content right now it's going to look  real messy as it's doing it but look at that   pretty much in an instant it's not only given us  the desktop view or version but it's also given us  
22:09
the mobile view so we actually it's done some  of that work and again this is where a lot of  
22:15
those processes you don't need to do them by hand there's really not a huge reason for you  
22:20
to be doing some of these by hand when there's  already components that are tried and true they   work really well and there's already versions  of them that are found to be responsive and  
22:29
work well there as well so uh with that said it  looks like we have a pretty decent wireframe for  
22:35
our site uh we probably should shift our  attention over to content so I'm going to  
22:41
jump back over to the web and uh I'm going to  jump over to the content section that means  
22:47
I'm going to open up something like chat GPT and  you can see here what I've done is I've already   opened up chat GPT and I've started to feed  it information I gave it the previous website  
22:56
I said grab all of that content scrape that  website for content and I want you to start  
23:02
rewriting sections for me so it grabbed all the  content it started rewriting things his welcome  
23:07
or about me sections his contact information  studio location and then I started kind of  
23:14
doing a little bit more content work and utilizing chat GPT to help me get started   now one of the things I always like to do when I'm  doing content work is I like to do things in the  
23:24
style of Donald Miller which if you don't know who  Donald Miller is I'll put some link Down Below in   the description he's basically a marketing and  website Guru that has a lot of these issues or  
23:35
or problems already worked out he he has created  systems and processes for the solutions so I like  
23:41
to actually query chat GPT and say hey wouldn't  you give me some overcoming what are called  
23:46
overcoming objection statements in the style of  Donald Miller focusing on why users should book  
23:52
a consultation or tattoo remember I'm staying  committed to the user's goals or to my client's  
23:58
goals and what do their users want they want to  book a tattoo an overcoming objection statement  
24:04
is basically me calming their nerves and answering  questions before they even realize they're having  
24:10
them it's a little bit of inception we're  going to be Leonardo DiCaprio like three   levels deep so stay with me we're saying hey we want to speak to their needs as  
24:19
they're already thinking about them they probably  have these objections they're probably thinking   themselves you know I'm really concerned about the  tattoo design process or oh man I'm really nervous  
24:28
about the commitment or what about hygiene is it  safe is this artist skilled I'm probably thinking   all of these things as a potential client  and this is where a lot of this structure  
24:38
is really really important your strategy is  really going to help you the better your  
24:43
strategy section is the stronger that your  structure section or work will be and at the end  
24:49
of the day you can actually get paid well for ugly  websites as long as they're accomplishing their  
24:54
goal of executing upon that strategy and so much  of it has to do with the structure content and you  
25:02
know the funnel and how you're actually solving  the problem this type of content is solving the  
25:08
problem and it's content he didn't have on his old  site I said you know hey write me a few more of   these but I need specific ones how about and these are directly from my client these are  
25:18
questions that he gets all the time how do I know  the cost how do I take care of my tattoo you know   can he design something custom for me so I got  a few more I have a total of eight overcoming  
25:27
objection statements now that feels pretty good to  me and when I start thinking about my my wireframe  
25:33
that I have here structure-wise I go hey we have  four here but what if I did eight and all of these  
25:39
became overcoming objection statements ah I'm  starting to put together the content with the  
25:46
structure or the sections of the website that  came from the sit map lead back to that strategy  
25:51
work that has been done so this is all happening  very very fast and again you can do all of this  
25:57
from scratch if if you want to you can hand sketch  all of these and create gray boxes but I like to  
26:02
lean on tools that are using tried andrue trusted  things now we will talk about this later there's  
26:07
going to be a time and a place to break structure  to look at these things to go this isn't working   and I want to do something unique and amazing and and showcase my individual design skills  
26:19
that's cool that's amazing but let those be  particular or specific areas not trying to  
26:26
re-envision and reinvent the wheel every time  you come to a new website project because the  
26:31
process that I'm in right now is already cooking  it's moving to it's moving along quite quickly   okay so now what I can say is hey give me some  value propositions some things that are good  
26:41
about my client and why people might want to  work with him I'm saying hey expand on this   remember we said there was going to be SEO needs  hey give me some good SEO words right some some  
26:51
content for the page or his About Me section so  this is where you start looking at your layout and  
26:57
you start creating specific content and throwing  all that into a Content document and actually  
27:03
having your customer or your client speak into  that content document so here I would actually  
27:09
build either like a Google Document or a notion  document and I would start laying all of this   content and I would map them back to the pages and the cool news is you can do that or you can  
27:21
just skip the content document Al together and you  can start implementing it right into the wireframe  
27:26
because the wireframe happens so quickly so let  the wireframe be your content document at this   point in the course you could have a if you've  stopped and paused and in like got a free reloom  
27:37
account and set up your figma file you could  maybe already have potentially um a wireframe  
27:44
a layout a structure a Sit map and some content  build for this client or your client that you're  
27:50
working on so what comes next well this is when  we have started to you know lay out the wire  
27:58
frame and everything and this is where we want  to maybe even present things in a way that are  
28:04
maybe a little bit more beneficial for our client  to see if we really like this structure let's say  
28:10
we know this structure is going to be exactly the  way we want there are some tools and some tips and  
28:15
tricks that might help you and this is one of them  I want to just kind of fast forward a little bit   don't want to blow your mind too much but instead of building your wireframes inside of figma for  
28:25
instance there is a a pathway or a method where  you can do really really rough work inside of  
28:32
figma but then immediately start building them  inside a framer using something like this which   is called frame pad I actually have a copy of  frame pad and it allows you to wireframe really  
28:43
really quickly let me open up framer and kind of  talk through this process if you want to skip all  
28:50
together so when you download something like frame  pad we're here inside of framer and we just get a  
28:55
file so what I could do is I could duplicate  that file um which I can just come down here  
29:00
and say why don't I go ahead and duplicate this  project it's going to take a second and then I  
29:06
basically have a starting project with a bunch  of wireframes um and components and elements  
29:12
really similar to reloom but they're already  done for me the cool thing about this is I can   publish this as a staging website instantly  I could publish this as a basically a web  
29:23
version of a wireframe that's responsive  and adaptive and I can send my users my  
29:28
clients a link and they can actually start  giving me feedback directly inside of that  
29:33
link so let's go back now to Fram pad and see  that we have a copy that's duplicating let me  
29:40
open up the previous one here inside a framer  and show you how this might work double click  
29:45
and see if we can open it up and again where  would you start you might start here off of  
29:51
if you want to do a little bit more of what we  call a low Fidelity process instead of more of  
29:56
an AI or automated process process to help  with some of these things like site maps   and wireframes you might instead come in here  and start actually drawing your wireframes here  
30:05
instead and we would just do really rough boxes  like hey here's my hero image and this is going  
30:11
to happen here let me zoom in I'm going to  do a button right here and I'm going to do   a big headline right here maybe some body copy  okay that's great and I want some testimonials  
30:22
maybe we'll do a couple of them on the page so  we can do this really low Fidelity like this  
30:29
and then from this low Fidelity we could move into something like Fram pad and we could  
30:34
just immediately start kind of inserting stuff so  for instance when we're here in Fram pad you can   see all of the different elements it already has  typography set up for me it has colors and we can  
30:44
just modify those later on but it has things like  different sections that we can use like nav bars  
30:50
and you can see I can actually zoom in and see  all the different nav barss maybe those will work   for my project so very similar to reloom except  it's already in framer website form here's a  
31:01
bunch of hero sections I'm sure we can find  one that looks really really similar to the  
31:06
one that we've already selected inside of our  wireframe so let's look for one that has more   of a center aligned image I think maybe even  here it is zoom back in here's one that has  
31:17
a little bit more of a center aligned image so  we would just insert version hero vertical one  
31:23
into our project when I go back over here to  Pages let's go to my homepage you can see I   actually already have one inside now again what's the beauty of this we can start inserting sections  
31:33
for instance like a metric section sorry let's go  back here to home and we want to for instance grab  
31:41
whoa sorry let's do this assets we'll jump over  to assets and we can go into things like FAQs and  
31:49
we like we like the look of that so why don't  we do according we'll just drag this on to our   stage and I'm just going to put this inside of my  project everything is built using kind of stacks  
31:58
and auto layouts and really really quickly we  could just make a couple of changes here tablet  
32:04
phone and make sure that we filled the space  and all of a sudden we have responsive things  
32:10
happening here okay so same thing we can go into  like our you know pricing section we don't have  
32:16
a pricing section but you can imagine I'm just  going to drag this into place and I'm going to   set it to fill and now for the most part  everything becomes pretty responsive here  
32:25
and the good news is if we have our website set  up here we can just publish it and we can send  
32:30
our client a staging link and we can say hey I'm already building your website once you come  
32:36
in and check out the progress that we've made here  let me go back really quickly and just scroll up  
32:43
here we go we have a website that's being built  and you can see it's already responsive so it's  
32:48
very helpful sometimes to build things in the  in the medium or in the format in which they're  
32:54
ultimately going to be received which is for us  a website so these are two slightly different   paths a bunch of tools to get you started but  what is foundational or pivotal here in this  
33:04
section the structure section for you to  understand is that you have to build a Sit map   you have to build out a Content document you have  to build out wireframes and then however you would  
33:14
like to implement all of that to get your clients  something to start looking at and approving the  
33:20
structure you can take any path you want but all  of this all of these techniques and methods can be  
33:26
very very helpful for speeding that process up so  next we're going to actually take our design back  
33:32
inside of figma because that's the route we're going to go on and we're going to start exploring   some of the visual design color typography layout  making some of those changes and we should build  
33:42
out a pretty customized website because we don't  want to just ship templates we want to customize  
33:48
and build it to actually match our client so that  we're meeting their needs so with that being said   we're going to move into the design structure  or excuse me the design process right now now  
Design
33:57
it's time to get into the design work which is  the fun part it's the part you've probably all   been waiting for me too it gets really really  exciting when all the strategy and structure  
34:06
is behind us and we get to start visualizing  and being a little bit more creative and this   is where we're really going to start to add  that layer of customization so again we're not  
34:15
starting everything from scratch we didn't draw  all of these wireframes but we're definitely not   taking a predefined template and just maybe  changing the text inside and selling it we  
34:25
are again are going to be doing our customization work right now on our website you can see we have  
34:31
our s map over here and we have our wireframe  over here which we are going to be taking our  
34:37
wireframe and in each of these sections which  are reloom components we're going to be taking  
34:43
them and then just detaching them from the  instance so now we have access to the design   and we can be changing anything and everything  inside so I like to just take all of these  
34:52
and then just detach instance and again some of  these are going to be really EXP directly into  
34:58
framer and some of them we're just going to  we're going to design pieces and then we're   going to use frame pad or framer components and  just work from there and style them backwards to  
35:08
match the design but there is a process we'll  talk about where after we're done designing we   get to just bring a lot of this stuff directly  into framer from our design so we'll talk about  
35:16
development next but for right now before we get  into any of this we need to go into an exploration  
35:23
mode exploration mode is really for us to take all of that competitive set analysis  
35:29
and start to design some initial visual directions  before we start designing the website we might  
35:36
have various different ways that we want to work  color palettes typography imagery so we're going  
35:42
to come up with a couple of different ways in  which we're going to do this or could do this   website and then we're going to create some messy  mood boards and eventually what we'll call some  
35:51
style tiles and that's really where we start  a lot of this is just investigating the web a   little bit here is a really bad tattoo website  that my client brought up and said they really  
36:00
liked but again we don't just say oh okay my  client likes this I need to make it like this  
36:06
we have to ask those questions what do you like  about this why do you like this and as I started  
36:11
to ask those questions I noticed that it had  very little to do with the way it looked it had   more to do with a couple of Aesthetics really  he liked the fact that there was an About Me  
36:19
section here and a gallery you could find in a really big book Now button that was very clear  
36:25
he liked more of that dark Vibe but he said  you know he wished that maybe it was like he  
36:30
could see it being a mixture of dark and light  because maybe this looks a little bit too kind   of tough guy so he wanted maybe a little bit  more of a balance so I'm going to take comps  
36:39
like this I'm going to start going to other  sites like dribble and I'm going to start   looking for things like tattoo website and we get  a lot of different stuff happening here so I'm  
36:49
just going to bring up a bunch of these like  I'm just going to hold down my commander   control button and just start opening up tabs and  trying to find some something that you know maybe  
37:00
Sparks some interest something that looks kind  of interesting here's a lot of tattoo inspired   stuff something that's maybe a little bit  more modern that's kind of interesting okay  
37:09
great so we're doing a little bit of this maybe  something like this as well maybe uh I saw some  
37:15
kind of inspiration there let's go over to behance as well and do some similar stuff so   here's a tattoo website here's couple things that  are looking kind of cool I'm just opening up tabs  
37:25
in the background you can see them all loading up  here here in the top of my browser bar Uh custom  
37:31
design got some dark colors with some maybe light  kind of uh you know oranges or yellows kind of  
37:37
popping off of it that looks like it could be kind  of cool let's and again we're just looking for  
37:42
styles that might match what he is saying that he  liked so we're going to bring up a bunch of these  
37:48
and now just comes the time where you're just  going to start clipping things and building   what we call a messy mood board so I'm going  to jump over to my tattoo design website I'm  
37:59
going to create a new page here I'm going to  call this page mood board and just like that  
38:06
now we're working in this blank page and you  guessed it I'm just going to bring my browser   over because I have it in a separate tab here  and I'm just going to start really saving a lot  
38:16
of things so actually I'm going to pull this over here so we have access to our desktop a little bit   why don't we just start grabbing and I don't  even want to grab entire things I just want  
38:25
to grab things that are kind of interesting  to me so I'm just screenshotting things like  
38:30
so is there anything else on here that was kind  of cool this is kind of interesting I like this   kind of three up we have some plus and kind of  expanding FAQ stuff down here I feel like this  
38:40
relates that's interesting um let me see we have  kind of like an appointment booking thing so  
38:46
I'm just grabbing stuff and a map inside  the footer I think that's probably kind of   interesting and important so I'm just snapping  things I don't like a lot about what's going on  
38:56
here although I might say that I like some of the  call to action or like the you know alternating  
39:02
sections but there's not a whole lot to like here  so I'm going to skip that one I do like kind of   these modern kind of like bit of typography  that's working here so I'm and it's got a big  
39:12
logo and actually if we look back in our design file for our starter here you can see that we have   actually have a bunch of starting assets from  our client I'm going to drag this over bunch of  
39:22
starting images some of the jewelry he makes  and he has this really big very like tattoo   inspired logo so I think this resonates well  like a really clear navigation up top lots of  
39:32
imagery of the portfolio happening pretty quickly  but what I really like here is the kind of like   the bright powerful typography off of this  dark background there's good contrast and  
39:42
Clarity there let's look at some stuff like  this yeah like you know some of this is okay  
39:48
but I don't love it I feel like it looks a little  bit old just slapping some tattooed stuff so I'm  
39:54
actually going to take a picture of this as  an example of what not to cuz I don't want   to do that right although I do like kind of  this larger section so I'm going to put some  
40:03
x's and some check marks that's a really really  big portfolio and hard to kind of like take in  
40:09
I wonder if they have any other examples this is kind of interesting for our shop um okay so we're  
40:15
going to take a picture of that what else we got  let's keep cruising through again we're kind of   staying away from stuff like this although we do  have a pretty clear call to action here so I might  
40:25
just remember that that's what's interesting to  me about this one anything else not a whole lot  
40:31
of other things are interesting to me this  feels very messy to me I don't like it got   some tattoo inspired artwork there kind  of cool but this one is actually kind of  
40:40
interesting I like the background words like  these outlined kind of background words there  
40:45
so why don't I just clip that because that's kind  of interesting to me and you know it's so much   of what we've been taking a look at it's really  tattoo inspired and there is like some Polynesian  
40:55
stuff cuz he's in Hawaii that we probably want  to get in there uh but also we don't want it   to be unmodern we don't want it to be like so  tattoo or so Pollan that it doesn't kind of  
41:06
fall in line with satisfying his clients because although I'm making this for my client ultimately  
41:12
I'm making it for his clients and his clients are  not tattoo artists that live in Hawaii they are  
41:18
the average person vacationing to Hawaii so they  want might want something a little bit more on   the modern and simple side so I'm kind of keeping  that in mind when I think about sections like this  
41:28
like again do I love this no as an entire layout  but it is a little bit on that simple and modern  
41:34
side of things so I you know not really much to  take a picture of here but just to keep in mind   like really maybe even maybe I will take a picture  because it is kind of a modern palette and it also  
41:44
has big bold kind of lettering and typography  happening inside of here so I like this big bold  
41:50
typography snapping images of like moving things  again like I kind of like this I kind of don't  
41:58
I'll tell you what I don't like about it is um I  don't like how everything just looks disjointed   but I do like some of this warm color I think I'm  starting as I'm looking at it starting to kind  
42:08
of settle on warmer colors maybe being used as call to actions I feel like that pops cuz   here's what we had over here was like a cool  color on Blue it doesn't pop very much and I  
42:18
want things to be very very noticeable so again  like really modern stuff maybe um no not so much  
42:25
there again there's some of those warmer tones  we're talking about I don't love the just giant   text sitting on top of imagery but I do like  some of this warm on dark I think it's really  
42:36
really interesting the amount of screenshots  we're taking feels like Madness this is   kind of interesting too there's a little bit  of grit and grain or handrawn kind of elements  
42:45
inside of that I kind of like that don't like  that we can head over to mobin but we're not   going to find a whole lot okay so next step is  why don't we actually uh bring all of those in  
42:56
so I'm going to hide my browser and why don't I  drag this across I'm going to zoom out here and  
43:03
I'm just going to grab all of this go over  to my mood board here and why don't we draw   a frame and just bring all of these in our project and it's just going to be a data dump  
43:13
a massive dump of stuff and uh sure why don't we  actually just grab all of them command or contrl  
43:19
S and put it inside of a section we don't need  a frame we have a real messy mood board right  
43:26
um so with that being being said now like we  could maybe sort these into different messy  
43:32
mood boards cuz we're probably looking for  maybe two different directions I have an idea   of where we're going to go but uh I don't want  to have so many different directions and ideas  
43:42
that they feel really really disjointed from one  another I want them to be fairly similar right so  
43:48
I might actually in this case just go with One  Direction and start pointing out what I like   and don't like and I'm I'm I'm going to make this  even Messier actually I'm going to grab this whole  
43:57
section I'm going to come into my fig Jam file and  I'm just going to paste it over here and all those  
44:03
images are going to follow me because what I'm  going to do is I'm going to start just circling  
44:09
and highlighting the things that I like so let's start out with a pencil down here and we'll   go to green make sure it's like in the big size  and I'm just going to start circling the things  
44:18
that I like and don't like like I really like  these like handdrawn images and I really like  
44:24
this big bold typography see I like the warm there  uh again I like the warmth here and we can kind of  
44:33
talk about this more later what do I like here I  like some of this kind of grittiness in here or  
44:40
Texture being included and I really like this  layout so we're just going to go through and   start highlighting things that we like and we'll  come back and do the things that we don't like  
44:50
therefore we can have a nice conversation I  like the map and I like this typography and  
44:56
I like actually how you can see the logo there  this I like the whole thing cuz it's very very   clean um just the layout like having that text  over there in white and a nice big image of some  
45:06
sort uh let's I don't like that but again  I do like some of this warmth I feel like  
45:12
we could probably improve upon that button love these FAQs I think they're going to be important  
45:17
and a contact form we're going to have one  of those uh as well and again the warmth the  
45:23
warmth we're really dialing in on some things  we like and some things now I'm going to Mark   in red that I don't like I don't like this all  sitting on top of an image so we're not going to  
45:33
do that I don't like you know the image being  right there necessarily in the top but more  
45:40
than anything I don't like the contrast there  that's happening um again same thing like bad   contrast between that blue or that gold and  that green not a big fan um you know I think  
45:50
that we want things to be fairly simple again  I just don't like this whole thing and I'll   I'll explain to my client why and um I feel like  there's too many images here we want to focus on  
46:00
them I really I don't think he's going to need  a lot of interaction like spanning things to   see a light box most people are viewing things  mobile so I just wanted to look like a really  
46:08
dialed in Instagram feed I feel like that's going to be way more modern um I don't like   any of this layout and is there anything I don't  like that I can point to and speak to now that  
46:18
probably works for me for right now so with  that being said uh I have what I would call   a messy mood board and I would definitely if I  was not pressed for time come in here and start  
46:30
to write some text on these on the things that  I like and don't like and I can make these large  
46:36
and fit the right color and I would say you know  image background or whatever and put like bad  
46:44
contrast like I don't like that so I would Mark  each and every one of these what I like what   I don't like about it but with this being said  I actually have some direction I know that I'm  
46:52
leaning towards a darker website probably with  some light sections to keep it modern and clean  
46:58
so now I'm looking for color palettes and  typography that match these these color palettes  
47:03
should be warm should pop off of like black and  white really really well and the typography I'm   going to want to have probably a variance like I want to have one I'm going to keep it really  
47:11
simple and modern a Sans Sara font that has  lots of Weights that reaches up to a nice   really kind of like powerful modern kind of  bold or thick style so I'm looking for some  
47:22
color and some typography and eventually  some imagery so why don't we go back over   over to the web and we'll start looking for some  of those items and immediately I'm going to jump  
47:32
over to typography um I'm going to start I'm  just going to go to Google fonts I'm going to   start looking for some some typography that we really really like like I want Sans serif there  
47:43
um what else do we want uh number of styles I  like to have at least seven or eight styles to  
47:49
kind of choose from that's nice and I wouldn't  mind getting some stuff that's a little bit more  
47:56
you know like on the chunky side of stuff  so we have sand serif uh display fonts no   we don't want to mark that let's uh let's just  go with that let's see how it looks like and  
48:06
we'll just kind of typ set a bunch of things  like it'll say Hawaii tattoos here and we can   just start looking through a bunch of these  right so I have a couple in my mind um and I  
48:17
want to sort them by name um you know like  we're looking for and I wonder let's just  
48:23
cheat it really quickly and uppercase everything  and what that looks like um Okay cool so we have  
48:30
things alumni that's kind of interesting  that's not quite as bold as I was looking   for that's kind of interesting that might be  a little too tall a little too much a little  
48:40
too tough cuz we want it to be uh cool but  we want it to be um maybe not uh not so  
48:48
tall so I'm going to look through here and just  find a couple of fonts I'm going to press down   command and find some ones that I like and then  I don't know we'll see if we can go with some  
48:56
of them you know mean um let's go like this  and I'm going to close these filters I don't  
49:02
need them anymore actually what I look at this  like in a dark format I'm just going to flip   the switch to the Dark theme so that I can kind  of see what they would look like between light  
49:11
and dark those are kind of interesting um I think that we'll just pull a couple  
49:17
of these that look kind of good and  so we'll do geologicas kind of a good   one has some some Styles in there that are  really really good some those thicker ones  
49:27
and maybe we'll do something I don't want  anything with any sort of like curvature   or anything I want to be really really more  on the modern side so I we'll grab one or two  
49:37
more here like maybe uh MTA muish is always  a good one to try I like that in websites  
49:43
and then Noto Sands but let's do just normal Noto Sands and we'll start there okay so I got a couple  
49:49
of these and I can start to look down at the  weights and I'm looking for like the really bold   weight there that looks kind of cool jump down  to some of the boulder weights here that could  
49:58
be cool as well we might do I'm really liking this  one the geologica we'll download a couple of these  
50:04
and we'll make sure that we play with those  um also think I have a font in my head that I   think might work but a lot of these I think are  really kind of cool they're not too sporty too  
50:13
nikeisha dark on light light on dark I feel  like they look pretty good so I'm going to  
50:20
grab a couple of those and I'm going to move on to  color palettes and let's see what we can find in  
50:27
color palettes um but first i'm looking  for a font that I might actually have on  
50:32
my system you may not have but uh yeah we  won't do it we'll just stick with what we   can find on Google fonts for now let's jump  over to a tool like coolers and we can start  
50:43
you know maybe like looking uh or building our  own color palettes but there's a lot of really   beautiful color palettes that have already been  built here so what I'm going to do something like  
50:51
warm um I'm looking for something that just  kind of kind of pops uh I want to have some  
50:58
black in it it's telling me I got to sign up for  a pro count let's look for orange actually and  
51:05
um maybe we just find one that has like some  black tones that go with it and I think we'll  
51:11
we'll stay fairly monochromatic here because  again we want it to be fairly simple this   looks kind of cool um okay yeah yeah we might uh open this pallet and again I'm just hitting the  
51:23
three dots in the corner and then we can kind  of see a bunch of options here so I just said   open pallet we can also um you know like we can  visualize the colors we could do something like  
51:34
that and it'll bring up a little bit of a pallet  visualizer so this is kind of cool I can kind of  
51:40
see this palette playing out in some designs so I  kind of kind of digging this palette we might work  
51:46
on it a little bit and again this for me is the  start of exploration I might stick with some of  
51:51
these palettes I might modify them and kind of  like tweak and change them as I get them into the   design and start to see my needs a little bit  right so let's go back and find one or two others  
52:04
um I think this one looks kind of interesting  this one has just good scale I could probably   slap white and black on top of this and that  would probably work so why don't we open that  
52:12
palette and also visualize those colors as well  so that palette we got that darker one pretty  
52:19
simple actually I think I'm just really digging this one it's really really simple   although this one I feel like might work  a little bit better in the light stuff I  
52:27
feel like we'll go with this one and honestly  this is all I'm going to do let's say I kind of   like this palette I'm going to use this as the  starting point I'm just going to snap an image  
52:36
of it and you guessed it I'm going to bring it  into my project so let's find our color palette  
52:42
bring that in there like so and I'm going  to make it a little bit warmer something  
52:48
like this this is a messy mood board that's all this is and then uh I've downloaded a couple  
52:55
of those fonts so let's just go back and find  the ones that we really really liked here and  
53:00
actually what we could do is uh we could just  snap some images of these as well so let's go  
53:07
down here and maybe just snap a couple images like  this again very very messy not the ultimate way  
53:17
to present or do anything but we're just getting  that messiness down we're going to refine these  
53:23
quite a bit and let's get like to maybe even  get some of this typography in here a lot  
53:31
can happen through just messy snaps and pictures  get that like so that's looking pretty cool Noto  
53:41
s let's go down I really like Noto Sands I think  that one is looking pretty cool bring a couple  
53:49
of those in I think I missed dropping down and  getting full type set of one of them which was  
53:56
this one this was theica which we really really  like so I'm going to grab that section as well  
54:01
just like that cool I'm going to drag this out  of the way let's look for our screenshots here  
54:07
got a couple of those yeah let's just take a couple of those and bring those in and we're  
54:13
starting to get a little bit of a visual  Direction here so super interesting stuff  
54:19
okay great now we've built a little bit of a  messy mood board I'm going to introduce you to   kind of The Next Step here which would be taking  this messy mood board and you can use this messy  
54:28
mood board if you want to for conversations  but I would prefer to actually have something  
54:34
that's a little bit more dialed in a little  bit more structured and not just a structured   mood board but something that I like to call a style tile and a style tile is  
54:42
really you've taken the mood board you've  taken that messiness like we've moved from   something like this just grabbing shots and  images and ideas and you might have you know  
54:53
experimented with building something that's  like a structured mood board where we start   to vet out and figure out the things we love  from that messy mood board and structure them  
55:01
a little bit more I like to take it one step  further and actually design something I call   a style tile this is not like you're actually designing the website but you're designing almost  
55:10
like a little mini mock version it's not the final  doesn't have to be exactly how it looks but it  
55:15
starts to put into place some of the kind of like  look and feel of the site you can visualize it a  
55:21
little bit more like we have a navigations  and some icons being used and some buttons   and honestly for me this is where I fast  forward the process I just go really  
55:30
really messy and then I grab a pre-established  style tile like this one and I bring it into  
55:36
my project so now we have this messy mood board  here um and then I will just come over here and  
55:43
paste in my style tile and I'll start working  from there and obviously we would have wanted   to have all of these pieces of typography in  here as well but let's just work off of this  
55:54
I'll bring my style tile actually over on the  other side and why don't we just start doing a  
56:00
little bit of that work where was the color  palette that we had I'm going to bring that   in great now we can start dialing in and customizing and making things look a little  
56:10
bit more like a website now I'll be honest I  don't love they're not perfect the colors but  
56:16
we're going to work off of them and see how we  can get there what's really cool in figma is I   can actually just come down here and I can see all  the colors that I'm using in this style tile and  
56:25
I can just start replacing them actually which is  kind of fun so I can grab for instance like this   green I can Target it and say Hey where's that  green being used instead I just want to use like  
56:35
pure black there and let me see what else do  we have when I click this entire style towel   we're using another version of green that's  happening in that part of the color palette  
56:44
I'm going to grab that and I'm going to Target  like this lighter black like kind of this off   black color already kind of looking a little  bit closer let's grab our yellow and replace  
56:53
it with orange okay pretty good good pretty cool  um and that's replaced a lot of our stuff here  
57:00
and then what we can do is grab all of this text and it's using Roboto but I think we were  
57:05
using something like Noto Sands in here and we  can just come in and look at that we're already  
57:12
starting to kind of work on things so let's do  something like extra bold and we'll pump that   up to all caps to see what that looks like and we  can say you know uh get a tattoo at Hawaii tattoo  
57:27
something like that why don't we just shrink the  size down okay cool and then we have a bunch of  
57:32
lurm ipom sitting in there and you know we had  this dark color over here maybe we'll use that as  
57:38
our secondary orange so let me just grab that  secondary orange real quick looks pretty cool  
57:43
to me I think uh the next thing we have to do is  let's just zoom out let's go back to our starter   and let's grab a couple of these elements that  we had from our client maybe the jewelry maybe  
57:53
the images maybe some of the shapes have some  Polynesian shapes kind of hiding in there come  
57:59
back over the mood board kind of give it  some distance from our messy mood board   and look at it alone cuz it's looking kind of good paste all those items in and let's  
58:09
figure it out let's bring these in okay and  obviously we're going to want to grab the  
58:14
fill off of some of these images I'll keep them  exactly where they're at I'll just replace the  
58:19
image fill like that that's not a very good  one let's go back over to starter do we have  
58:25
something that works a little a little bit more  I think this one would look work a little bit   more I'm going to just copy that fill head back  over to mood board and heck I might just throw  
58:34
that in there like there I might move this up  just a little bit and make some space that looks   pretty cool and again let's grab everything  in here and just move this to something like  
58:45
Noto Sands right so Noto Sands we're just kind of  realigning things that looks pretty cool I think  
58:52
our stuff inside didn't get changed let's go Noto  Sands there again doesn't have to be perfect and  
59:02
I don't know this is like a little card element  I had for like a different project but it's fun  
59:07
to visualize UI elements also so we'll also grab Noto Sands just slap that in there you  
59:13
know really really simple stuff let's grab  our buttons over here and change those as  
59:19
well boom just like that everything here now is  Noto sand okay great so why don't we grab our  
59:26
our logo here and I'm just going to cut that  and come right here and paste it shrink it  
59:33
down get it on the page it feels a little bit  like a nav bar here maybe just a tad bit and uh  
59:39
I'll probably shrink the size of this text so we  don't have to see quite as much of it I'm just  
59:44
designing like a little kind of like fake layout  here having a little bit of fun let's bring this  
59:50
Polynesian kind of texture in here and why  don't we bring the capacity of it way down  
59:58
and I'm actually going to grab it and put it  behind everything else so stuff can kind of  
1:00:04
pop off yeah something like that and we'll move  our icons up it's looking very very inspired by  
1:00:12
the brand I think let's get rid of those images  I think I had like another image sitting over   here and that was like another Polynesian like a really light Polynesian texture kind  
1:00:22
of putting that up at the top maybe we put that  up at the top here and bring this into our other  
1:00:31
side over here let's make it white there we go  take our style tile let's just make sure it's  
1:00:38
inside of here we're just cutting it and pasting  it look at that now we have like some kind of  
1:00:44
tattoo or Polynesian inspired stuff happening  on the top and the bottom I'll just bring it   down is there anything else we're missing yeah  probably an image of the uh of the jewel that he  
1:00:56
sells so let's bring this down and I'm just  going to crop and bring the size of the image  
1:01:02
up so you can see it we'll just pop that little  image right in there and you know what we might  
1:01:08
bring this down here and again we're just kind  of doctoring elements and making it seem like  
1:01:13
it's all connected not saying by any means  that this is the way that we're going to lay  
1:01:19
out the cards or anything for for our uh  our shop items but this is where where I  
1:01:26
am just customizing letting my creativity  flow kind of bringing down some of those  
1:01:31
textures and now this feels like to me something  I could present to my client and say hey client  
1:01:37
I did a bunch of research and exploration and I  found some visual a visual direction that I think  
1:01:43
really really works and this is where we can sell  our visual Direction and our design rationale and  
1:01:49
this gives him a pretty good idea on where it's  going to go is it the end all be all no it's  
1:01:56
absolutely not but if I need stuff  like you know if I need him just to   get a glimpse of what I'm imagining the  website might kind of look like I think  
1:02:05
this does kind of a decent job and if you want to  you can create one of these two of these three of  
1:02:10
these however many visual directions that you  want but then comes the time where you know you  
1:02:16
present and you get Buy in right you get Buy  in from your client so with that being said  
1:02:22
uh I think that we are looking pretty good  here I just want to walk through something   something another asset that might be helpful  to you if you are struggling with visual assets  
1:02:30
because I happen to have visual assets provided by by my client for me or for the  
1:02:36
project but maybe you don't have any of that and  you need some I definitely recommend using mid  
1:02:41
Journey mid Journey's newest version doesn't  actually have to happen inside of Discord so  
1:02:46
they actually allow you to imagine things directly  within the app which is kind of cool so I might uh  
1:02:51
write something like uh Polynesian uh poian um  tattoo on uh tan arm of a tattoo client I don't  
1:03:05
know let's see it's submitted and we can start  to run and generate ideas here uh we can come  
1:03:11
over and you can see 15 18% completed it is  working right now and we can do lots of these  
1:03:18
but this is how mid Journey works mid Journey  will kind of store your prompt and then we can  
1:03:23
actually rerun that prompt and get different  AI generated imagery and you can see look it's  
1:03:28
already starting to come in right it took my  natural language prompt we used to have to   use weird keywords like you know um tattoo 4K  photo realism we don't have to do that now mid  
1:03:39
journey is in my opinion probably the best image generating tool on the market cuz look at look at  
1:03:46
these realistic results we got right again here's  what we're looking for polan tattoo on tan arm of  
1:03:51
a tattoo client this looks really really good  so let's say my client didn't have good images  
1:03:57
or didn't have any good photography to use  across the site this is a great way to start  
1:04:02
and you can do this for anything and everything  you can see I've researched like logo types and   different backgrounds and I've done you  know letters and Logo marks I actually  
1:04:11
use these images for a client project check out  this one it was a young hip music producer in a  
1:04:17
synth wave neon style working on a desktop  and these are the cool images that I got so   you can generate really cool images here and  if you really really like it for instance I  
1:04:26
can bring this up and I can start to give it  some instructions like hey maybe I want to   vary it a little bit more subtle more strong  upscale it be a little bit creative sure all  
1:04:36
I really want to do is just subtly upscale  this but really for now I can enlarge this  
1:04:42
and I could drag this onto my desktop and check  out this image that I have to use it looks just  
1:04:48
as beautiful just just as good I could take  this fill and this is not my client's work  
1:04:54
but it could be like What if I just pasted  that right in there and now I have imagery  
1:04:59
that I've never had before and again that's  using mid Journey either the new version or   the old Discord version to generate those assets  now the time would come to present this work get  
1:05:10
sign off and approval like we've talked about and then move into High Fidelity design which we're   going to do right now all right I'm back here  with my design file and I just spent all that  
1:05:19
time created my mood board I'm actually just going  to copy this really quickly and I'm going to paste   it in over here this file has my general visual  Direction it has my layouts via my wireframes  
1:05:31
that we're about to modify customize and really  dial in and make sure that we're stylizing things  
1:05:36
correctly and then I have a bunch of those assets  and things and again I have my site map over here   I'll just move that out of the way we're probably  not going to use that now when I brought in things  
1:05:44
from reloom I actually got a bunch of reloom  components and there's a bunch of different   ways you can go about this process I'll leave that  up to you you could modify all the components work  
1:05:54
within the components but but honestly I just like  to detach the instances of all those components  
1:06:00
like I've done on both the desktop and the mobile  view and I'm really just going to dial in and  
1:06:05
focus on you know on working on these detached from that instance okay so not working at a  
1:06:12
component level but one of the things I do  want to do is all of these are inside of an   auto layout here inside of figma and all of my  different sections are Auto layouts as well um  
1:06:23
but and you can see as I start to actually  like grab an element it is fairly responsive  
1:06:29
like to a certain extent right so there is  some responsiveness happening here but when  
1:06:34
I grab the entire thing it's not responsive  that's CU it's nested in a parent frame so   I'm just going to grab all of these really quickly and I'm going to move it away from  
1:06:42
being fixed and I'm just going to have them all  fill the container and look at that instantly I  
1:06:48
have a fairly responsive view I can start to  stretch and E and flow now I know that we're  
1:06:53
going to move things over to framer for our  no code development section and I know I'm   pretty sure anyways that these standard sizes  about 12200 pixels to be designing on for your  
1:07:04
desktop mode or desktop view so I'm just going  to set this to 12200 pixels and that's perfect  
1:07:10
now we have the beginning of our kind of like  desktop view now there will be responsive stuff  
1:07:16
that we'll do but we could do all these designs in  figma responsively but we could also just design  
1:07:22
all of this and then really quickly get it into  framer and and framer will handle all of that   responsive stuff what we'll do is design desktop  identify any responsive switches changes or issues  
1:07:33
and then bring all of that information with us  into framer so we're really just going to focus   on the desktop view here for now um okay so we have our our layout here the first thing we're  
1:07:44
going to do is we are currently using whatever  came from reloom as the Styles when we brought   those Styles over from reloom it brought all of  these type Styles as well which are great and we  
1:07:55
may use those but I just want to make a switch  really quickly because if I drill down on them  
1:08:00
you can see that they're using like Roto and  I don't want to do these like individual one   by one so instead what I'm going to do is  I'm going to open up a plugin and I think  
1:08:09
it's called batch Styler there it is right there  I'm going to grab batch styler and you can see it  
1:08:14
shows me all of my text I can grab every single  text link that's been provided and I'm just going  
1:08:20
to switch this over really quickly to Noto sand  let's Noto sand there it is oh it's coming it's  
1:08:30
coming it's coming I could probably just keep  typing and find that there it is not to Sands   like that it's grabbing all of those weights  all of the sizes everything and we're just  
1:08:39
going to update the Styles and we should see everything update instantly like that on the  
1:08:45
page so we also we have a bunch of colors but  there's no colors really used over from reloom  
1:08:50
yet so no problem um we could create those color  styles really quickly but let's start actually  
1:08:55
just applying them into our design so the first  thing we know is we're going to have a button   that button is going to be orange I have some  plans for this button I want to make it really  
1:09:03
stand out but why don't we just zoom in on that  and uh I think we have a sub headline here we  
1:09:10
had another one so I'm just going to copy and  paste it I'm going to move it up above and we have   our content document here that we pulled from chat  GPT and you can see there's a bunch of content so  
1:09:20
here's our hero section and all the content  that's going to sit inside of it you can see   I have kind of like a main headline here and then  I have whoa watch out now and I I usually put in  
1:09:30
Brackets the things that are going to be buttons  and I would probably even uh link these if I was   doing this um you know and wanting to show this content document to my client I would link all  
1:09:40
the ctas the buttons or the links so that you  know they know exactly where those are going   to lead so this one says taking appointments I  why don't we just pop that in there and uh we  
1:09:50
don't need it to be bold I don't think and  then this one I think just said Josh Flynn   and which is his name and then we have a line  that goes down below so let's do something like  
1:10:00
Josh Flynn like that we'll pop the text in there  and I think we only had one button because we  
1:10:05
have a singular call to action CU remember that  is solving the problem all we want people to do  
1:10:10
is book we don't want them to learn more we just  want them to book right so there might you know be   a place for a secondary call to action but for us  right now it's all we're going to do um okay cool  
1:10:20
why don't we start by actually looking at this  element here here and somehow uh reloom is also  
1:10:28
brought in components so why don't we just really  quickly I'm just going to um change this cuz we  
1:10:34
have a bunch of colors it looks like it did bring in we're going to need to break that color   and let's find our color of choice here I believe  it's this orangish kind of color um and let's just  
1:10:45
zoom out so we can actually see things there we go  there's our orange color great fantastic why don't   we just really quickly turn that into a style  so we will just H here hit the Plus and we'll  
1:10:55
call this not primitive semantic we got a bunch  of variables and styles that have been created  
1:11:01
and if you don't want those you can do away with  them we'll just ignore them for now so we'll just   call this primary uh and we'll even put CTA there  and create that style we have a secondary one here  
1:11:13
so let's just do that one really quickly uh style  and we'll go primary um light this and okay so we  
1:11:25
got some colors in there and I'm pretty sure  we have black and white so we'll probably be   fine there let's zoom in regrab this component  switch the fill to be here we go our primary  
1:11:35
CTA and what's our call to action it's going to  be book a free consult so why don't we say book  
1:11:41
a free consult something like that and let's not capitalize that let's take the Border off  
1:11:48
of this guy and yeah we don't need a stroke for  now and I think let's try rounding the edges and  
1:11:55
doing more like a pill like button I'm just going  to put 360 up here in my border radius and Okay  
1:12:01
cool so far so good it's still using Roto there  for some reason so let's just do this let's detach  
1:12:08
this instance and let's create our own button and  you know what I'm going to do instead I'm going to  
1:12:14
actually just go back and detach this and instead  of doing a solid fill why don't we actually   do a fill like this and we'll grab  that lighter color where is that light  
1:12:26
great going do lighter color there and this is  really dark it's not even our brand color so  
1:12:32
let's grab that there we go that looks pretty  good looks like we got it in there we're going  
1:12:38
to do something a little bit more exciting I think  why don't we bring up our gradient there and bring  
1:12:45
that down and then I'm going to switch this to  Let's see we have our H1 H2 we should have some  
1:12:53
text Medium bold 18 pixels that's a bit large but we can go with text alternate um and text  
1:13:01
regular I think 16 is probably better like let's  do 16 there something like that and then why don't  
1:13:07
we really quickly just uh I'm going to retype  that and say book a free consult let's do that  
1:13:14
in uppercase and we have this button but the whole  thing is there's like a little bit of space there  
1:13:21
so I'm just going to pull that out get rid of  whatever that other little space is there and just  
1:13:26
rename this uh button that good and then let's  do I don't know let's let's play a little bit  
1:13:33
really quickly so let's do a an outside stroke  like that and let's grab our color here let's  
1:13:42
do light and we'll even actually kind of break  that light color why don't we bring the opacity  
1:13:48
down so it's kind of like this little bit of a  glow on the button that could be kind of cool   all right and that looks like hey maybe that's  the button our button components so why don't  
1:13:55
we turn that into a component we've done so  perfect and uh now what we need is an image  
1:14:02
why don't I zoom out and I'm going to grab something like this image I'll just find the   fill and just paste that inside I think we're  going to just shrink the size down a little bit  
1:14:13
and we have rounded buttons why don't we round the  corners a little bit we're just starting to slowly   but surely come up with a little bit of a style I  think the style here was a little bit on the rigid  
1:14:21
side a little bit on the Square side I'd rather do  something a little bit more kind of like soft and   welcoming and inviting so I'm just going to bring  the space down here and we got content there  
1:14:33
and we have the button why don't we just put  that inside of the button and don't need this  
1:14:40
necessarily so we just have this one area we  can change the spacing for all of it and our  
1:14:46
button just got flipped around so let's put it  like that let's increase the spacing again a  
1:14:51
little bit okay now this is where we're going to  find you know we're we're going to get to play a   little bit more but first we'll come back and  we'll play with all the type Styles the sizing  
1:15:00
we'll get really really interesting here but let's get some content on the page and   figure out how we all want it to or how we  want it all to kind of like play out so this  
1:15:08
whole section has our white primary background  that's cool and uh let's just start to do some  
1:15:14
of that flip-flop let's add a dark section  here so I'll come in and of up here color  
1:15:20
neutrals let's just go black there and I'm just  going to drag a version of this over so I can   see the content that's there but yeah I definitely  want my my section my reviews to be in Black why  
1:15:34
don't we do this why don't we make them the  error State really quickly and then we can   grab all of the selection colors in there we  could flip them to White really quickly so  
1:15:43
just flip everything in there to white and white  like that and then we can take that text error  
1:15:53
and come back up and just go to Black okay so we  just kind of inverted everything inside of there   and I don't necessarily love this and this is  where we start kind of thinking about creating  
1:16:03
individual components right I'm going to have I want to have multiple of these on screen multiple  
1:16:08
of these uh reviews on screen but I don't love  the way that these are currently set up so let's  
1:16:14
do a little bit of work here um we want to read  since there's going to be multiple we want to read   these I I want to read them probably a little bit  more like cards I think so why don't we fill this  
1:16:25
section with like a kind of almost darker  kind of like neutral kind of gray color  
1:16:30
let's give it some padding on the left and  right it's got a fixed size why don't we   hug the contents there we go that feels  kind of good and I don't even think I  
1:16:38
don't think he has all this information  I don't think we need the extra logos um  
1:16:44
I think that we can get rid of the divider  that we don't need that I probably we these   are Yelp reviews and not all of them come  with an avatar and a lot of times I don't  
1:16:55
come with like a name or anything like that so  there we go we're doing something like that let's   left align everything take our text align it  um pretty cool um so yeah we'll just come back  
1:17:07
over to our content document and here it is we  have like a review from Angela C so we'll just   grab that really quickly pop that in and just  put Angela C great and let's make this kind  
1:17:21
of interesting shall we um we could I think  probably grab these and fill them with our  
1:17:29
primary CTA o that's the wrong thing grab the  individual vectors or the Stars themselves give  
1:17:36
them that size or give them that style there and  this is like very very big this is like a H5 I  
1:17:43
don't think I need it to be an H5 so and notice they have like desktop and mobile  
1:17:50
Styles here and I don't actually need that  what I'm going to do is I'm going to depend   on the desktop Styles and I'm going to let  framer do all the mobile resizing stuff for  
1:17:59
me so why don't I just grab these really quickly  and delete and I'll let these kind of stay to grab  
1:18:07
all of those and just move those out of that  subcategory don't need them just headings text  
1:18:13
so many different styles we probably don't need  all the Styles why don't we just grab these as   well delete those and see delete those as well  and then we just have a bunch of text styles  
1:18:25
that are like around 16 oh I see why they did  that so okay interesting we'll keep those for  
1:18:30
now and it's always interesting to see like how  REO and these different tools kind of give you   stuff so I probably won't use the tiny so I'll  get those out why don't we come in here real  
1:18:38
quick and just put those in kind of like a text  Medium maybe like doesn't need to be so large  
1:18:46
absolutely not okay so now we have a review let's give it a little bit more padding around the   left and right hand side and the top and the  bottom we're 32 pixels all around that feels  
1:18:56
like a pretty good review card we could stretch  this out and change the width a little bit more   if we wanted to manually change it but I like  that so why don't we turn that into a component  
1:19:07
um you have the testimonial section and then  we are going to actually call this thing the  
1:19:14
testimonial box testimonial box you don't have to  rename these layers if you don't want to there  
1:19:20
we go turned it into a component and  then I'm just going to duplicate these   I think they're inside of an auto layout I'm going  to grab all of them and the entire section is an  
1:19:30
auto layout so we can just change direction in  which the auto layout is moving and we can mess  
1:19:36
with the gaps or the spacing so now I can see  that there's multiple and maybe we'll even have   these kind of rotate or automatically move or  maybe we'll put some controls to slide through  
1:19:44
but I think it would be nice to have them kind of automatically move a little bit so pretty cool   I'm liking that this text is going to need to  be way bigger so uh this is where we might want  
1:19:54
go do a little bit of a typographic scale like  experiment here um so I mean I definitely want  
1:20:01
my H1 there's not going to be many H1s so I'm  just going to cheat this right now and make   this way way bigger and then I'm going to go into  the details and just capitalize everything and I  
1:20:12
think it is set to bold why don't we make it like  even Bolder like black or something like that and  
1:20:18
the character spacing seems to be like really  really interesting I'm not sure that I love the  
1:20:24
character spacing so why don't we come in and just  kind of change our character spacing that's in   percentage just tighten it up a little bit and  I'm starting to look at the Noto Sands and not  
1:20:34
really love it a whole bunch but let's just we'll  stick with it for now um okay so we have kind of  
1:20:39
this top section I've I'm feeling like there's  a lot of extra space um this is the padding on  
1:20:45
the top and bottom we have 64 on the sides I don't think we need this much top and bottom   space so let's just bring that  in and I can see why there was  
1:20:55
kind of like some segmentation or some you know  some changes to the the spacing or the grouping  
1:21:01
excuse me for like all these little elements like  maybe I want like a slight little amount of space  
1:21:06
here so I might put those all in an auto layout  and decrease the space in between those and then  
1:21:12
increase the space between that and the button  just making a little bit more space and again  
1:21:18
I'm like I'm starting to play with the sizes here and this is where we're going to like   customize like I kind of want like a big bold  kind of headline here so that looks pretty  
1:21:27
good I like that so far let's grab our um our  navigation here and I'm pretty sure we have a   logo element I'm just going to shrink that down  because I tell it's already too big we're going  
1:21:36
to come in here and just paste it and let's  resize again a little bit something like that   cutting and just pasting it in let's grab this and  remove the stroke and let it kind of free flow  
1:21:47
and then I have a button here I'm just going to  re I'm going to get rid of these two buttons I  
1:21:52
don't need those I'm going to instead just um  command shift R to paste to replace and pop  
1:21:58
that in and then I think we had for our page  structure we just have our homepage and then  
1:22:04
we have about me gallery contact that's it so  let's just do Three Links right here and we'll  
1:22:10
just change these so it'll be about and let's  do gallery and contact no need for any sort of  
1:22:19
complex drop downs for this one but you can leave them if you want that's pretty cool and in our   design we had this like real subtle kind of like  Polynesian thing happening back there so let's go  
1:22:29
find that asset I just copied it I'm going to come  into this entire hero element I'm going to paste  
1:22:35
it and I'm going to absolutely position it and  then I'm going to take the Y and just put zero  
1:22:41
so it kind of shoots it all the way up at the top  now where do I want to put this maybe up here and  
1:22:47
I'll allow I I'll remove the background this and  then add that the background from that navigation  
1:22:54
and instead I want to add that neutral background  whatever color that is let's find I think it's  
1:23:00
just white to the entire thing and then we have  our frame here our Auto layout let's just make it  
1:23:08
so the content doesn't clip we don't want  that um and oh look at that it is kind of  
1:23:14
like going above so I mean we could have it kind  of lead up into it a little bit but I guess we   could just keep the clipping on there no need  to really take that off but uh okay cool so  
1:23:24
we have this Polynesian kind of element we could play with that and just kind of   move it around and this is where like you can  do a little bit of that fun kind of dragging  
1:23:31
and dropping stuff that's happening there um  I think that that looks pretty good I think   I might have a better image I'm going to open  up some of my images of this project and just  
1:23:42
find some of them now I've already taken a lot  of these images and I have shrunk them down to  
1:23:48
be a little bit more accessible um and converted  them from jpegs to like webp IM or avif format  
1:23:55
that's going to be a little bit um better so  let's find a better image here and just drag  
1:24:01
that there and move this one above and let's  see how it does if I just grab and move above  
1:24:07
that's interesting okay I kind of like seeing  him there a little bit more so why don't we   instead of filling why don't we crop kind of crop  that that way and then why don't we bring down  
1:24:18
the size of this image so let's go crop here  just do like a little bit more of that image  
1:24:24
little bit more 1920 by 1080 kind of Dimension there that feels pretty good okay um I like what  
1:24:30
we're doing we might you know make the logo just a  little bit bigger and make sure that everything's   staying centered there but so far if we take  our website it's looking pretty responsive is  
1:24:40
not uh it's not very adaptive though at this  point so um we can take the image and let's  
1:24:48
just try now filling again it's always kind  of filling um to the top so we're just going   to keep it cropped like that that's okay and  we have our review section this is a little  
1:24:57
bit on the boring side and I think we found in  some of our something I kind of missed was in  
1:25:03
one of our influences there was like this cool  like outlined text somewhere maybe we brought  
1:25:09
that over here some of the things that we did  love was this warm text like nice bold text  
1:25:16
ah here it was like kind of this cool kind  of outlined effect so let's see if we can   bring some of that in to our file right now now I  think the dark section down here might be a good  
1:25:26
place to start so I'm going to grab the text down here and why don't I just put something   like bring it down here I'm just going to work off  canvas and I'm going to break this and just bring  
1:25:39
it in tight and this could say something like  reviews let's give it a stroke remove the fill and  
1:25:46
make it a white stroke something like that that's  kind of cool we don't need this old section over   here that was just for a reference and let's take  that and we'll come into our section absolutely  
1:25:59
position it X of 0 y of zero kind of move it up  to the top now where do we want to put it um I  
1:26:05
think it's really really bright right now I don't  want this to like stand out too much so I'm just   going to move it down and maybe even kind of  tuck it behind like that's kind of cool have  
1:26:15
it kind of peeking we're we're kind of coming  up with like a little bit of a style here like   something that's kind of interesting that we  might we may just want to repeat throughout the  
1:26:24
rest of the site so let's make it like nice  and big here and maybe it even goes like  
1:26:29
up under like all the cards and maybe it needs to have something a little bit more  
1:26:35
interesting about it as well like the stroke is  this color why don't we turn it into a gradient  
1:26:41
and we'll make this gradient color white but  we will fade out the opacity to zero so it  
1:26:48
looks like it's kind of fading let's bring that  gradient back up and make it fade out a little   bit quicker I want it to be legible but I you  know it feels like it's almost glowing up from  
1:26:58
the bottom let me just zoom in see if you can  kind of see it and get your kind of take on   it I kind of like it I think it's kind of  interesting so that's pretty cool okay um  
1:27:06
we have kind of a style here and in our white  areas it looks like we have some like uh a  
1:27:13
little bit of a Polynesian kind of background  why don't we see if we could play with getting   another Polynesian background in here again  absolutely position it um let's turn turn  
1:27:24
this to Black and interesting okay why don't  we do another thing on here where we we'll do  
1:27:32
a fade I'm just going to grab my gradient tool  let's go from white to white 0 to 100 white and  
1:27:43
we should get some sort of fading effect  there and let's bring the opacity of the  
1:27:48
gradient all the way up good okay so gradient  again um why don't we Fade Into the content  
1:27:54
this time so it's not very distracting I'll bring  our gradient up that way and maybe fade it out  
1:27:59
like that now let's take our entire that shape is  like sitting on top of stuff so let's make sure   it's like at the back of our stack and then this  is going to be our H2 it could be an H3 let's make  
1:28:10
it an H2 and then let's change the style that's 140 so we could actually go open up cuz I think  
1:28:18
I'm wanting like much bigger kind of like  type scales here so why don't I open up  
1:28:24
something like uh types scale.com um and that's  going to help us a little bit so bit body size  
1:28:32
of 16 here and we can scale up much faster and  that's going to get our if you look at it and  
1:28:38
open up this whole thing that's going to get our  H1 in and we're counting this in Rems right now  
1:28:46
um let's look at it in pixel form about 182 so we  can maybe scale a little less fast um that's kind  
1:28:54
good I kind of like the blockiness of inter  as I'm looking at it there's some characters   inside of Noto that I'm not really the biggest  fan of I think this is maybe a little bit more  
1:29:03
modern so we might go back and try inter and just  switch things over but I think this is kind of   interesting so um I'm just going to grab this  and take a screenshot of it and I might bring  
1:29:15
that in there's probably a fancy way to bring it  in but this way works for me so I'm just going   to grab that screenshot and I might use that to kind of build my type scales here  
1:29:26
so let me just bring this in it's good cuz we  we don't want things to be like really really  
1:29:32
bad and like flying all over the place in in our  type sizes so let's grab text move it over here  
1:29:42
okay and what are we saying here we're saying  that our H1 is going to be about and I like to  
1:29:48
round just to like normal numbers so about 127 or  128 let's come to H1 and let's make it 128 it's  
1:29:57
actually pretty close to what we were looking  for okay and then H2 we grab this one now and  
1:30:03
apply duplicate it down and get H2 that one's  going to be at one or excuse me 90 so why don't  
1:30:10
we go in and edit that one really quickly and  we'll do something like 90 so it's nice and   big good there's our H2 and but it was pretty  bold as well that's the problem I think we're  
1:30:19
like leaving behind some of that bold style  we need to go up to like extra bold and I   think we need to capitalize again why don't we  just keep that style happening as we kind of  
1:30:29
scale down h3s can be 64 so let's go and turn this into an H3 and edit that H3 to be about  
1:30:40
64 pixels again let's capitalize that one  that'll be the last one that we capitalize  
1:30:47
and let's change it from Bold to that extra  bold okay so now when we did that we should   have changed them on the page as well so you  see if this one's using the H2 it's quite big  
1:30:56
and I think all this one says is something like  why hire Josh um okay and that looks pretty good  
1:31:05
I like what's happening here and H2 let's move  that to an H3 pretty good pretty good okay cool  
1:31:11
now the last thing I'm going to do is I'm going  to bring Styles back up that batch styler and   I'm going to take all of my Tex styles again  and move those from Noto let's do like what  
1:31:22
does it look like if we go to enter and update  the Styles it's just a lot blockier it's a lot  
1:31:27
more modern and clean kind of like what we were  looking at for our kind of big modern typography  
1:31:33
doesn't have any like loose little characters  so I didn't really like that Noto sand I think   that what we have with inter is maybe just a little bit more clean and modern so I like that  
1:31:41
quite a bit um this is looking pretty good and  I'm just going to come in and lighten and to  
1:31:48
bring that up a little bit more and maybe what  I need to do is just bring the whole thing down  
1:31:55
just that little bit of opacity for my color  down here so I'm just bringing that down to   five and kind of switching things I want it  to be subtle but I don't want it to be hidden  
1:32:04
you know what I mean that looks pretty good and  this was the area where we were going to have  
1:32:09
uh I believe eight different um sections  and those sections were all going to be if  
1:32:15
I remember correctly why hire Josh it's like  eight different benefit Rich pieces of copy  
1:32:20
these are our overcoming objection  statements let's grab our first Tex   right here out of our copy Dock and there is a  piece of text so I'm just going to hold down and  
1:32:30
duplicate and pop in my text right there and then  I have to figure out why this thing is flying up  
1:32:38
here all alone let's put those in an auto layout  and remove the spacing left align everything and  
1:32:45
our I think let's go left align with our  headline we do have Center Line at the   top but I I kind of like the idea  of left aligning let's just try it  
1:32:54
and then we'll come back to it and we'll  see how it works this is a really long rag   or really long line here and I don't think I  want it to be that long so I'm just going to  
1:33:02
bring this in a little bit and turn it into  like two lines or three lines whatever that   is and then I'm kind of thinking I'm going to do  the same thing here let's left align everything  
1:33:12
come inside left align and let's just grab our  text left align those things as well and then  
1:33:20
I don't think we need a sort of Link here so  what I'd like to do is just kind of like fix   one of them and then we'll add right we'll we'll  add all the all of them properly once we've fixed  
1:33:31
them so uh we have a logo we'll just or an  icon excuse me we'll leave this icon here for   now we'll just grab the first piece of text that  says like experience Mastery something like that  
1:33:41
and then it says uh 25 years of experience okay great that now let's style this thing we'll turn  
1:33:49
it into a component and we can just reuse that  component over and over how do we want to style   how do we want to make it look um I think  what we could do is I need to bring in I'm  
1:33:58
missing my color so I want to bring a little  bit of color in here and this is again just   a stylistic choice and when I look at my mood  board I see color a you know lines like this  
1:34:07
are a little bit more prevalent a little bit  more present so I'm making kind of a creative   decision right here why don't we do that we'll  add a stroke only to the left side and then  
1:34:18
we'll add some padding to the left side like  that and our stroke will be our primary color  
1:34:25
why don't we widen that so we can actually see  it a little bit better that looks kind of cool   I don't mind that at all and you could imagine  that if I had four of those like they're going  
1:34:34
to stack next to each other like that they look  kind of cool actually so why don't we turn that   into uh command control K and turn that into a component and I'm just going to add 1 two 3  
1:34:45
four right there and get rid of that old one  and I'm going to leave these as is for now I  
1:34:50
could come back in and replace these um if we  want want to and I might use something like  
1:34:56
phosphor icons that's like a really really great  pack of icons and let's say this is like Mastery  
1:35:03
or experience we might want to do something  like a trophy you know you can find like a   good trophy icon and they got a bunch of different  styles I actually really like the duo tone ones  
1:35:11
so maybe we just bring one of those on screen  like so cut that and I don't know replace it  
1:35:20
with something like that could be kind of subtle  uh it's a a little bit dark like some of those  
1:35:25
like the pieces of the icon so I wonder if we  just lighten it no yeah we can keep it as is  
1:35:31
that works but I like those generally speaking  those are pretty good so I'm going to take that   row it's sitting here in a row and that row  is inside of like a container so I might just  
1:35:40
duplicate the row and have them in their own Auto layout and bring them down like that and that way  
1:35:47
they're still responsive sorry we just got a  little a little bit of freezing happening let's  
1:35:55
think I was copying the whole thing so there  we go yeah it's it's set to fill so again we  
1:36:01
can grab this thing our picture is going to be a  little wonky but if we were to size down and start  
1:36:07
trying to make our design a little bit responsive  it's going to do that well and then we know that   that's going to be a problem area we're going to  have to flip that into a three column and then  
1:36:14
maybe a two and then maybe a single column  that's what I'm kind of seeing over here   what's really great is when we get these  examples from reloom it tells us that you know  
1:36:23
that we might want to end up here but it doesn't  tell us a lot about those in between states those   tablet states where things start breaking down  we can start to build our own solutions for  
1:36:33
those kind of moments there so I feel like this  area is pretty good let's do the about section  
1:36:38
we've been alternating dark light dark light why don't we go back to dark here really quickly   I'm going to just do that little trick where I  turn everything one color I find the text I'm  
1:36:48
going to turn that to White I'm going to turn  it to White and then I'll grab that primary CTA  
1:36:54
color and turn it to Black just kind of inverting  everything but that way I can easily just Target  
1:36:59
those colors that are sitting inside of here  and you know be able to flip things around  
1:37:05
without messing up my layout too badly why  don't we grab uh this background image here  
1:37:10
maybe and zoom in this is probably not the right  image for this spot but and start to insert some  
1:37:19
of our copy here so let's do about and and just  like that Comm man c will paste that we got  
1:37:27
another little section up above here cool so I'm  just going to pop that in there I like that fits  
1:37:33
great uh little bit uh yeah like um about Josh  plan he that's looking good and we know we need  
1:37:42
a button so I can either come over to my assets  and find a local component inside of starter home  
1:37:48
there's my button let me just drag one of those right in there and there we go we can get rid of  
1:37:53
these old buttons cuz those are not really needed  and do we like it like left right like this or  
1:37:58
do we want to switch our layout to be right  left either way works for me I don't mind uh  
1:38:04
but I think what was kind of cool is kind of  seeing the image on the left there was some   other stuff inside of what we liked and didn't  like I remember some little handrawn kind of  
1:38:14
elements like look at we're really reflecting  some of our inspiration right like these light   bright buttons these kind of like warm buttons  popping off these dark backgrounds some of these  
1:38:23
text from our Polynesian stuff but I know there  was some like little handdrawn elements I think  
1:38:28
maybe they were there or somewhere else so um  something about like the handdrawn aspect of  
1:38:33
it is making me wish I had like a little  arrow pointing to it but we can leave it   like this I think this looks pretty good for  now um and then why don't we come down now I  
1:38:42
mean we're starting to fly we're starting to really pick up some speed one thing though is   we've started certain Styles like this and why  don't we just really quickly switch that that  
1:38:53
over to enter and make sure that we can fit all  of that text I feel like that looks better but my  
1:39:00
my gradient that's on that seems to be really  really blocked right so I can't see it really  
1:39:08
really well let's grab that gradient and bring  it down more as soon as I changed to enter it  
1:39:14
like changed the visibility of that gradient  okay so uh I like this kind of like idea  
1:39:19
here but we should probably keep that same style  going so why don't we bring this up here and this  
1:39:26
can be like it could say something like 25 years  like speaking about his experience you know what  
1:39:33
I mean so we can kind of Tuck that up and you can  see it's overlaying on the photo we're just going   to command left bracket and move that behind  so everything always falls behind that's a  
1:39:41
style that we have speaking of consistent style  we're always doing I think it's eight pixels of   roundedness on things like images you can see it there on our cards we're doing some roundedness  
1:39:52
I believe if not it should be at about eight  there we go grab our original one we'll set  
1:39:59
that to eight perfect we're just kind of  creating consistent Styles here across the  
1:40:05
board that looks really great and again we're  doing left lined so what I might actually do is   just kind of come up here and grab this header  section and I'm going to come down and command  
1:40:15
shift R paste to replace everything's  just left aligning it because we are now   picking up speed like quite a bit aren't we so so I think I'm just going to grab all of these  
1:40:25
tattoo images like this and come down and see if  we can't get these inside let's see if we can we  
1:40:34
have content there I see it's in two separate  rows I think we could probably do that a little  
1:40:40
bit better why don't we do this and we will use  some of figma's native wrapping like that um that  
1:40:48
seems pretty good and then we can grab these  and just size them in you know it's imperfect  
1:40:55
but we get the point right what we're trying  to do we could put some minimum and maximum   widths and do really cool stuff or whatever but  look the the wrapping like does almost exactly  
1:41:04
what we need it to do right we know that when we  get it over in framer we're going to fix that up   for sure so that section I mean wow is like almost  completely done I think we are missing like a view  
1:41:14
more button or link so why don't we create a  style for that really quickly um I'll probably  
1:41:20
just copy and paste this I'm thinking like of a  text link most likely so why don't we drop down  
1:41:26
to like an H6 um and let's see we might come into that H6 and we have text text regular text small  
1:41:37
let's go actually there's a link size or style in  here so let's go text large link that's 20 yeah  
1:41:45
that could work um and then we could just put  something like you more don't mind that at all  
1:41:51
it has that natural like under under line but  let's change that to be like our primary like   CTA color I think that could be kind of cool  and why don't I just hit bold I feel like that  
1:42:00
makes it a little bit better could we style  that a little bit more maybe potentially for   sure do we keep this Polynesian theme coming  down the page like this maybe maybe not maybe  
1:42:12
it's a bit Overkill I'm not really sure you  don't want to over theme something but I it   does look kind of nice there okay I don't mind  that at all that looks kind of cool we might  
1:42:20
keep rolling with it and see what happens I think  let's see we had uh I don't think we actually had  
1:42:25
this section I think we had an FAQ section and  there was no sort of like image like big like  
1:42:32
CTA you could totally do one um and it might be a good addition but why don't we  
1:42:38
just keep rolling the way we're rolling okay  uh we're going to do FAQ here so instead of   like all that long kind of stuff why don't we  just do like some simple text that says FAQ no  
1:42:49
need for that long piece like there we go it  had some cool text like actually written for   us and I think we had uh these are just like like  flying out there like completely exposed and open  
1:42:59
which I don't mind um I know that we're going  to need a better button in here for sure so  
1:43:04
why don't we just really quickly easily  replace that button and we could do that   we could also do some cool FAQ stuff or like  accordians collapsing it's a little bit more  
1:43:14
interesting once we get inside a framer let's keep  it like this for now one of the things I'm going   to do is I'm actually going to bring that button  out just for now I'm going to do that inversion  
1:43:23
technique again one more time let's just change  the background there take the text why don't   we flip everything over to White then grab our primary and move to Black then we can bring our  
1:43:33
button back in and the only reason I mov my button  out is because it too is orange and I didn't want   it to affect everything so why don't we just play  with these because I feel like it could look kind  
1:43:43
of nice it's a lot of information on the page  in my opinion and you might want to tuck some   of these away so why don't we do that um to  do that I'm going to I think kind of create  
1:43:54
a component here and a style that goes along with  it so let's add a little bit of padding and what  
1:44:00
color did we use for the background of these cards  let's create some consistency here it was this   neutral kind of neutral darker color is the name  of it um so why don't we do that really quickly  
1:44:11
I'm just going to select that and why don't we  give it a fill of that neutral darker color ah  
1:44:18
okay that looks good and why don't we hide in this  case the I just deleted it but I could have just  
1:44:24
command shift H to hide it and on this row I think  I might want to put like a plus in there so I'm  
1:44:30
going to bring fos for icons backup because I don't think I have a plus and we don't need   this plus to be Duo tone it could just be uh a  nice bold kind of plus I'm going to drag it in  
1:44:41
there and see if it pops up the right way it  kind of does let's get it inside that little   container right there and just make sure that  our Auto layout is running from left to right  
1:44:51
and that the entire box is is going to fill the  container and the text itself is going to be the  
1:44:57
thing that fills that way it's always going to  push the icon to the far right hand side that   feels good and then we'll just change the  selection color here and do something like  
1:45:07
that okay that looks pretty darn good if you ask  me um and yeah I don't mind it at all so now look  
1:45:15
we could just like put a bunch of these like this  and take the spacing down and you either leave  
1:45:22
like a little one pixel Gap there if you want  or you can butt them up right you know across   each other or next to each other and we can  just fill these out like whatever these are  
1:45:33
we'll put the actual content in when we get into framer okay so we're just going  
1:45:41
to kind of show and why don't we actually show  one of them with the text exposed and we can't  
1:45:48
do that because we have those two say what we're  going to do we are going to put these back in a  
1:45:53
a top to bottom uh go like a vertical stack  or Auto layout and then we're going to grab  
1:46:00
the plus and we're going to put those two  things in their shift a own Auto layout that   goes from left to right and then the text will be  exposed like this we just need to make sure that  
1:46:10
that container fills again we'll just redo this  work really quickly want to fill like that so  
1:46:17
now we can see the exposed question version like  working there which looks really really nice okay  
1:46:23
so that's kind of kicking it down and you can see  the unexposed versions I'm just going to command  
1:46:28
uh L there to hide all of my layers and I think  we might need just like maybe a stroke potentially  
1:46:38
could be kind of cool um yeah let's do a stroke on  the bottoms of each one of these so I'm just going  
1:46:44
to hit um a stroke and I'll put it on the bottom only and why don't we do yeah let's  
1:46:52
do full-blown white but we'll just play with the  opacity here shall we we'll bring the opacity of  
1:46:58
that all the way down to like eight okay great  and and copy that stroke just by clicking to  
1:47:06
the left of it over here in figma grab all  three of these and paste that as well and on  
1:47:12
that last one we don't really need we can just  hide it and now we have separators in between   the only difference is it put them all the  way around one thing that figma does not do  
1:47:21
is keep the the side or like the direction of  your your borders so you have to manually apply  
1:47:28
that and when this thing is open we'll have we're  already kind of thinking about the interaction   it's going to kind of move to an X to close  kind of Mark all right so a little interactivity  
1:47:38
happening there we have something really really  similar happening with our Gallery as we do with  
1:47:45
our store so I'm just going to copy this and since  it's an auto layout I just press the down arrow  
1:47:51
and that moved it right there and now we have something like online store here so let's just   do online see how quickly starting to cook  now because uh custom jewelry okay so there  
1:48:02
it is we're going to do something like this  we'll take this text and boom we'll pop those  
1:48:08
right there and I think we only want to feature  a couple of these because that's not really the   his big deal his big deal is obviously tattoos  um so online store is there why don't we go and  
1:48:20
grab a couple of these online store images  and I'm just going to come inside of this  
1:48:27
container paste my three pieces of jewelry I  almost got rid of everything there by accident  
1:48:35
delete that and why don't we just mess with  these and like we need to shrink them up we  
1:48:40
need to we go find that balance yet again now  I'm just holding down command and finding the  
1:48:48
right kind of width for them and they'll  probably have some more interactivity there   uh we'll leave those for now as like fairly  basic but we will kind of make them consistent by  
1:48:58
rounding the corners I think in our inspiration  we had some shop items and they had like  
1:49:04
a name and a price so we could turn these into a  component really quickly why don't we just yeah  
1:49:11
let's do it why not we're going to grab this one  and this one and we'll call this Tiki necklace  
1:49:19
it could be something like that and uh let's see  let's see let's see let's have this actually hug  
1:49:26
the content for the text that's there we'll  have this whole thing kind of hug the content  
1:49:31
so now you can see we're kind of building a card  with floating elements next to it and we'll copy   paste like this actually why don't we just grab this link so I could already see a link right  
1:49:43
there I'll come down into this element that  I'm building and this will say something like C  
1:49:51
details great and we could put those in their own  Auto layout moving from left to right and filling  
1:49:57
the container and of course we'll have this one  fill the container that way it pushes the link   all the way over to the right hand side let's just  reduce the spacing so these cards and the text and  
1:50:07
everything feel like they're connected the card so  boom boom you can fill up the space let's get rid  
1:50:12
of these other necklaces and this is link large  I think we might want to go link medium or link  
1:50:19
small and I think probably back to that  medium size I think that feels good um  
1:50:26
okay great fantastic um and yeah could we put  the price on there there's all sorts of things   we could do but we don't necessarily need to  do we're really just trying to crank through  
1:50:36
and help to kind of understand how to build  these uh these sections a little bit more why   don't we kind of duplicate this and use  this as the starter for a footer this  
1:50:45
could say something like ontact and then um you  know I think we had like some text down here  
1:50:51
it says something like are you ready to create  something extraordinary together sure we don't  
1:50:57
need these FAQs but underneath we're going to  have like a section where we put I think we need  
1:51:02
to have like the address I think maybe we were we  saw some inspiration of having a map in there so  
1:51:08
why don't we kind of like look at this and use  this as a way of redesigning um this footer I'm  
1:51:16
going to zoom out a little bit and just paste this here kind of as my reference and I'm using  
1:51:21
the elements that have been given to us in  almost every black section we probably should  
1:51:27
have carry that style down um you know we have  like something that's there like some sort of  
1:51:34
like little gradiated like word right let's  make sure we're bringing that down into these   other sections um let's let's you know uh let's  do something like uh contact in in Hawaii they  
1:51:47
say like Aloha to say hello and goodbye so why  don't we put Aloha in there we can contact that's  
1:51:52
kind of cool and then let's do something kind  of we've we also like in a lot of these black  
1:51:58
sections not all of them we have kind of a card  element so why don't we I don't know let's do   something kind of fun let's imagine this whole  thing being kind of like a card I'm going to  
1:52:07
detach this from the instance like that I'm  going to have it fill the whole container  
1:52:14
and I'm going to put my content and my links and  everything my address and stuff all inside there  
1:52:19
so instead of having you know a review down there maybe I come back up here I think I had   a map let's grab that map and come back down and  I'm going to put a map inside of there like we  
1:52:33
want that to fill the container obviously and  we're going to format this and lay everything   out I don't need the stars but I do think I  had an address this is the address per the  
1:52:46
content doc so why don't we pop the address  in there so I think we had address and we had  
1:52:51
the map and then we had some links why don't I  just cheat really quickly and come down here   and grab a couple of these like uh let's do  you know Twitter Instagram and Facebook he  
1:53:02
great and we'll come back into our card past  those down below I don't like that they're   black they shouldn't be black so let's make them  white and whoa I lost them doing neutral there  
1:53:14
we want to have both of them kind of stand out  and be inverted great okay fantastic so these   all kind of belong together let's put them in  a group and then we have a piece of content up  
1:53:23
here it's its own thing um why don't we just reduce the size of those being spaced and now  
1:53:30
we can go from left to right let's see this  we actually want to this is fixed we don't  
1:53:38
want that we want it to hug the contents and  we want it to fill the container and for our  
1:53:45
social media we want that to hug the contents  as well and we need our our whole card to  
1:53:52
fill the container that's going to kind of bring  everything in we're working with the parent and   the children containers now the height of it  is fixed let's have that fill the container as  
1:54:01
well and it is looking really large so we can  manually now kind of take up a little bit more  
1:54:09
space or a little less space here let's grab our  social media links and put those like so and then  
1:54:15
shoot those each of those can get shot over  to the right we're just kind of creating space  
1:54:22
there for our our element now it feels very very  responsive I like that I feel like this is pretty  
1:54:28
good let's Center everything um and I think maybe  one more we'll put a link down in there that says  
1:54:35
something like nav I think we have that in the content doc so let's let's grab this   and that we're going to grab our address and  our heading Auto layout top to bottom um we're  
1:54:48
going to shrink that up and we just we we just  want to hug on but something's going on really  
1:54:54
really weird we had a weird sizing there for our  link and again that's the large link we might want  
1:55:00
to move down to the medium link that feels pretty  good um yeah it's kind of interesting and if if  
1:55:06
you don't like how this is space and you want  to give that a little bit more room you can   do so I think just having I don't know it could  be a little asymmetrical there or maybe we could  
1:55:15
even do something like this and be a little  bit more playful with it that's kind of fun   I like that okay cool uh let's get rid of  the old footer and this example footer and  
1:55:27
I feel like we're pretty good um we have just  designed our entire page why don't we bring  
1:55:33
this into prototype mode and just take a look at  it and see what we've designed uh we don't want  
1:55:40
to view this um inside of there we go it's a little bit more responsive now so you can see  
1:55:47
as we're like sliding through the laptop it's  showing us our design pretty cool again and all   that's placeholder content uh but we were able to  use this oh we could fix that up really quickly W  
1:55:58
something's wrong with our fq I don't know what  our top one for some reason is not filling the  
1:56:08
space as it should be there we go that's fixed  great and that actually matters too because as   we start to push things over to framer it  is going to matter how we have things laid  
1:56:15
out here inside of figma okay very very  cool I think we are pretty close here  
1:56:22
and in our next step we're going to be  taking this design and then we're going   to be exporting it and getting everything into  framer building it adding our interactions and  
1:56:30
Publishing this thing live onto the web all right  we're ready to move from figma over to framer but  
Framer Development
1:56:36
if you remember we didn't design a responsive  version we didn't do mobile we didn't do tablet   and that's not a problem because we're going  to let framer do all of that hard responsive  
1:56:44
work for us but at the very least what I like  to do is actually copy my designs my fully  
1:56:50
designed desktop view and that mobile view  that came from reloom library and bring it  
1:56:55
over into a fig Jam file and I like to annotate  and identify the areas of concern that are going  
1:57:01
to need to take place once I start thinking  about responsive design so for instance when   I think about this navigation that's going  to break down and reloom has recommended  
1:57:09
to us that we're probably going to need some  other Solutions so we're going to make sure   that we come up with another solution uh another  thing same thing here like when you notice our  
1:57:17
testimonials these are going to move from what  looks like a three column or a horizontal layout  
1:57:24
and it's going to have to transition into a one  column vertical layout or we're going to have to   do single images and sliding and change the shape  of them so we'll have to address those these rows  
1:57:34
of four benefits or value propositions  are going to have to move to a one column  
1:57:39
this two column layout is also going to have to move to a stacked one column layout this gritted  
1:57:45
portfolio layout is going to have to move to  not two because we're probably going to want   to keep it nice and large but to a one column  layout and even notice that uh around our our  
1:57:56
our site the differences between the type size  here for our headline is very different than  
1:58:01
what reloom suggested for the smaller one that's  because when you move between these different   screen sizes your type sizes should change  now here's the good news framer it's going  
1:58:09
to do all that for us which is super great but  I just want to identify these issues and these  
1:58:15
things so I make a little bit of a plan a little  bit of a task list for myself before I make this  
1:58:20
move now making the move is really really easy  I've actually opened up framer in my browser I've  
1:58:26
started a brand new project you can see here my  canvas is by default set to 1200 and I'm working  
1:58:33
in the desktop mode or desktop view that's why  we designed our website at 1200 CU we are ready  
1:58:39
to go now there's a lot of different ways you could do this you could use Fram pad and bring   all of those components in and just customize  them like I showed you earlier you could start  
1:58:48
with a template you could start with things  inside a framer but I want to actually   walk through and show you how to bring things  from your actual Custom Design from figma to  
1:58:57
framer and we're going to cheat a little bit  by using framer's own plug-in for figma and  
1:59:03
that's how we're going to start by bringing the  elements over and so to do so all we have to do   is come over here to our figma file and open up figma to HTML editor now whatever  
1:59:13
section or frame that you have highlighted here  going to bring that in so we might just want to  
1:59:19
name these a little bit better so we don't have  these weird slash and you can take the entire  
1:59:24
parent container we could grab this whole thing  and say hey framer copy this whole thing we'll  
1:59:30
bring it over as one piece but I find that  I get better results when I bring them over   section by section so I'm going to grab just this  header section I'm going to open up that plugin  
1:59:40
and click on it and you'll see it's going to tell  me down here at the bottom that it's copying the   layers and then it's copied the 10 layers all I  have to do now is paste it into framewor that's  
1:59:49
mind-blowing so I'm going to move over and I'm  going to grab my my area here and just command   or control V depending on your operating  system and the plugin's going to do that  
1:59:58
work and just pop everything in for me now it  doesn't look exactly the same and you might  
2:00:04
have had an issue where your height was fixed like this and so you only got a piece of it all  
2:00:09
you have to do is come up here to the height  and say hey we want you to fit the content   okay that's it and now everything's going to  expand and the only reason it looks a little  
2:00:19
bit different is because it's taken that large  background image and all I have to do is set  
2:00:24
that to Absolute absolutely position it just like  you would inside of figma and move it into place  
2:00:31
wherever I want it I think it was something  like that and you will notice that it's kind   of on top of stuff and that's that's not  what we want we want it to be behind and  
2:00:39
the layers panel is not actually going to help  us here what we actually have to do is come over   here into our right hand section and play with  What's called the Z index and I can move that  
2:00:48
zindex around to zero and then I can grab my image  for instance and I can give that a new style and  
2:00:56
give it a zindex of one and now you'll see it's  sitting on top zindex is kind of an interesting  
2:01:02
phenomena we don't have that in figma where it's going to control where it's   at in distance between the user and the actual  design right so Z indexing something would put  
2:01:12
it further in front of the other thing that's  the idea and so that section looks pretty sweet  
2:01:18
and I'm going to tell you what we're going to  do later on is you'll notice that as I play   my design it looks pretty good I'm getting some  sort of weird strange Behavior here so I that's  
2:01:29
why I like to go Section by section I like to  fix the sections and fix the behavior and then  
2:01:34
bring in the next section so why don't we fix  this section first things first this image is   all sorts of messed up and so let's get the  image here and we're not going to stretch it  
2:01:44
but we're going to fill the image is going to  sit inside it's going to fill and we press play  
2:01:49
that's already a little bit better let's fix that  image even a little bit more by actually grabbing  
2:01:54
the position and choosing focal point this  is going to bring up a really cool interface   where we can say I always want the focal point of the image to be his face and go ahead and  
2:02:04
apply that and when I press play you can see as  it tries to size down it's going to try to honor  
2:02:09
that focal point which is really really cool but  now I have really weird resizing of my text that's   not right we don't want that let's grab our frame  and just like in Figo we're going to see what's  
2:02:19
going on here right so we have our content and  a lot of this has to do with the width and so  
2:02:25
this is set to 100% uh that's set to 100% And  you can see that the width for some reason for  
2:02:32
that text is set to fix we don't want that we  want it to fill 1R or 100% let's do that for  
2:02:39
all of these we're going to set that to fill  fill and fill and now when we press play we  
2:02:45
should keep things fairly centered and it has some  resizing for us which is really really great now  
2:02:51
if we had really long text we don't want that  to expand tooo far maybe so we could actually   grab this kind of lock up here we'll reame our  our layer panel here it feels very similar to FR  
2:03:03
framer where we can rename things and we could if we wanted to set a maximum width all you got  
2:03:09
to do is come over here and sayy give me a  Max width maybe we want to do a Max width   of something like you know 1,00 pixels set that  boom it is now fixed and it will never expand past  
2:03:20
that now it doesn't really make a lot of sense  right now because we don't have a long line of   text but it will come in handy later I promise  you that okay so we're setting a Max width of  
2:03:28
1200 pixels and we could do the same here for  our image if we want our image to stay the   same um so that's you know keep that in mind if we  want to go Max width 1280 watch out we're messing  
2:03:40
with the opacity Now by accident Max width of 1,80  pixels like so now our image will stop growing at  
2:03:50
a certain width as well and this is how we're  going to actually maintain consistent alignment  
2:03:57
for our containers or containing elements inside  of framers by setting Max widths on things so this  
2:04:03
looks pretty good you notice we did not actually  bring in the navigation we're going to solve   that problem a little bit later but for now why don't we build our next section which is  
2:04:12
going to be this testimonial so I'm going to  bring I'm going to make sure I'm selecting the   section again I'm going to use activate that  framer plugin come on over select the entire  
2:04:22
document or the artboard paste and it just pastes  right in just like that now that's beautiful it  
2:04:28
brought it right in and we can leave it like  this and try to figure out what to do with it   or we can start to utilize some of framer's  kind of pre-built components that might be  
2:04:37
really really nice for us so for instance I want  this to move I'm going to go over to insert and   I'm going to look through the menu and find is  there anything kind of cool that I might want  
2:04:46
to use here like maybe we could put a video in  there or maybe we have some interactive things  
2:04:51
I definitely like this idea of either a  carousel or a slideshow or what we call  
2:04:57
a ticker so I might use a ticker and when  I do that it's going to bring that ticker  
2:05:02
right outside uh my canvas I can just drag  that in but before I do that why don't I  
2:05:07
go into my layers panel I'm going to grab all  of these testimonial boxes watch out I'm kind   of messing things up a little bit grab the  testimonial boxes cut those out of there  
2:05:16
and I'm going to paste them over here for now  I'm going to bring my ticker inside here and  
2:05:21
I'm going to turn off the fixed width okay  so the first thing I want to do is I want   to make sure that I fill and for some reason we  have kind of like something else going on there  
2:05:30
now you can see our ticker is taking up the  full width and why don't we raise the height   of it and because I have some nice padding on  this it set at 112 and 64 top and bottom 112 left  
2:05:41
and right of 64 I'm getting some immediate  control over our section now you might ask  
2:05:47
yourself okay like how does this ticker thing  work well we could just grab grab our little   dots over here on the right hand side of our  ticker and you can drag this out and connect  
2:05:56
it to different items and notice how as soon as  I connect it it's bringing those elements inside  
2:06:02
right so let's actually zoom out a little bit more and do one more we'll connect it there we   have our three elements and now I'm managing  that interactive component if I just press  
2:06:13
command P to preview and I scroll down you can  see I have immediate interaction and I can set   it with all sorts of different things so for  instance I could come over here and scroll down  
2:06:23
the right hand panel just like you're inside  of figma inside of a design tool and it tells   me I have three children that I can reorder  if I want to or add new ones I can slow down  
2:06:32
the speed of this ticker which is really nice I  think it's going a bit fast if we want to read   we can move it from left to right align it in  the center let's increase the gaps in between  
2:06:42
them I think that looks a little bit better  and then let's do on Hover we want to slow it  
2:06:48
down even more so that if you know somebody's  hovering over we want to read we do have that  
2:06:53
clipping and if we want to we can take the  fade off and it'll just clip its way all the   way out through the Border there and uh if we want also we can grab our ticker and or excuse  
2:07:04
me we grab our section and we could remove the  left and right padding from our entire section  
2:07:11
now again when we preview our website we have  something that's moving all the way off canvas   which is really really nice and when I roll  over it you can see how it slows down that's  
2:07:20
a pretty nice little interaction if you ask  me the only thing it's really missing is for  
2:07:25
some reason we missed out on our text and I  think that was that that extra component that  
2:07:30
was kind of weird and funky that was sitting  in there and I think the reason this happens   is because it's very hard for framer to  understand um outline text like this so  
2:07:39
what I'm actually going to do is go up to help  and just say hey I want to outline this stroke  
2:07:45
and turn this into almost like an SVG so uh I  think that if we now export this at has an SVG  
2:07:53
and rename it uh review outline something that  we will remember we can just export this to our  
2:08:00
desktop and let's just bring it into our document I'm dragging it onto the canvas we have some kind  
2:08:08
of weird Behavior there let's fix that before  we go shall we so that is not good we need  
2:08:15
to fix and figure out what happened to our s  let's just get the word review there for now  
2:08:24
I think that'll be easier we could fix that  whole thing but that's more of a vector art   based thing and we don't need to worry about  that so let's just get the word review right  
2:08:33
now okay we'll drag it in and just like we  did before we're going to Absolute position  
2:08:38
this thing bring it up and I think we had those sitting on top or no they were sitting on  
2:08:44
the bottom pardon me and let's just Center align  that whole thing bring it up and again let's hit  
2:08:49
that zindex and make it kind of fall behind  just like that that looks now almost exactly  
2:08:56
it's almost perfect besides the word the fact  that the word review is not pluralized okay so  
2:09:01
again command P to preview looking pretty good um  we are coming along with our website already Okay  
2:09:07
so let's go down to our next section I'm going  to grab uh this section I'm going to rename  
2:09:13
it the Y section and I'm going to open up my  plugin and I'm going to go from figma to HTML  
2:09:21
for framer and again we're going to grab the  entire desktop here we're going to paste that   in and you might be saying it's really weird  that you have these like testmonial things  
2:09:29
just sitting out here to the right but that's how  it works because framer is an infinite canvas I   can just leave these here and I can constantly  go back and deal with them and if I want to I  
2:09:39
could turn these into components so I'm really just creating one component and updating the  
2:09:44
content that's within it we might come back and  do that a little bit later as well so let's take   our our we're going to rename this and call  this our poly band here you guessed it we're  
2:09:54
going to go absolute and now I can do some of  the positioning in the top here you can see   that we're pinning it to the top and why don't  I put it at zero that means it's always going  
2:10:03
to stay anchored to the top there just like so  and we're having a little weird issue so let's   just bring our Z index down boom it put it  exactly where we need it to go framer is  
2:10:13
very easy to use feels just like a design tool  um now I can grab this element and I can even  
2:10:19
go negative if I want to uh or I can start to you  know like just just work with it as is I like it  
2:10:27
it's fine where it is I think for the most part  our uh our layout came in here pretty Flawless  
2:10:33
uh I think and uh so I'm I'm I'm pretty excited  about that actually that's almost perfect let's  
2:10:39
go ahead and press play um okay great all of our elements are there um let's move on  
2:10:46
shall we okay we're going to probably have to  come back and tweak a lot of this stuff as we   go we know that we're going to have to fix this  and again we're going to need to outline stroke  
2:10:57
just like so the s's uh the s's for some reason  are just getting really really messed up so let's  
2:11:04
just get rid of those s's 25 year I guess great  and then we'll export that as an SVG and rename  
2:11:12
that uh years uh text and let's export that  onto the desktop great and and now we can  
2:11:22
grab this whole thing again bigma HTML it's  naming it layout SL1 which is going to be  
2:11:28
really ugly we don't want that we're just going  to press uh really quickly control excuse me uh  
2:11:35
uh option L and that'll close up all of our  different elements here so I'm going to grab   my main um container I'm working in command V to  paste it in it's just going to take a second and  
2:11:46
again reminder we're grabbing that about section  you can see it's not honoring that text that's   why we're having that weird SVG issue but that's okay because we have our new year text  
2:11:56
we can just bring that in and we're going to cut  that and we're going to paste that there and again   we're going to set it as absolute drag it where  we want maybe Center it like so and uh let's just  
2:12:08
push it up like that and put the zindex down that  way it's fading behind our other elements there  
2:12:16
okay that's looking pretty good and yeah that  looks pretty nice now we've introduced a button  
2:12:21
and we know we're going to have  to come back and turn that into a   component cuz we're going to be using that  in multiple different places but our layout's  
2:12:28
looking pretty good uh we're going to do one more  here and then I think we might stop because it's  
2:12:33
going to take us a little while to finish the  responsive stuff I'll let you keep working on   the rest of the sections so I'll just do  this one more section really quickly right  
2:12:41
here and just copy that it's copying all the  layers done it successfully grab your desktop  
2:12:47
paste it in and again it's just going to take a minute and we'll probably rename both of these  
2:12:53
sections and uh so they just have some sort of  proper naming so let's name this one the about  
2:13:02
section like that and then I think this one down  here is the gallery section right let's just we  
2:13:11
put this Gallery inside of it by accident let's  just raise it up and put it on top perfect we   just drag these around put them where we need to  right okay Gallery yeah we we we had our about  
2:13:22
section selected so when we pasted it pasted  it inside it did what we told it to do but   all you got to do is grab it and drag it outside  pretty nice okay so again let's absolutely  
2:13:31
position let's do that at 0er pixels the zindex  just goes down one easy peasy lemon squeezy and  
2:13:39
now we have something kind of interesting  happening right like our images are flowing   outside of our container and that's because we  have our stack set here you can see it's moving  
2:13:51
from left to right but we could also set it as a  grid so why don't we set it up as a grid a three  
2:13:56
column grid and our elements inside have very strange sizing so we're going to have  
2:14:02
to fix this right now as well uh we want the  width to be fill we want the row to be one  
2:14:09
two rows how about three rows we're kind of  dictating size here a little bit so why don't   we actually dictate size even more so let's call  these 1fr and the height let's do something like  
2:14:21
300 pixels and we should see them kind of grow  there a little bit what are they here they're   about 340 and 334 they should be perfectly Square  so if we want to we can just make them perfectly  
2:14:33
Square um so we could do 340 pixels of width  and then 340 pixels of height um and we have  
2:14:44
our three rows but it's not fitting so I think we  should just go back to that one frr and we'll drop  
2:14:50
the size of the these down we're just modifying  slightly and we need a rounded border so let's  
2:14:56
just go over to radius here and just pump that  up to eight perfect just like so now we have a  
2:15:01
nice clear and because we're using grid it's going  to be very very easy to turn this into responsive  
2:15:08
grid when we drop down to those smaller sections so again let's preview our site   command p drop down looking really really good  our image is there our text is there all of our  
2:15:18
images for our tattoos are there we are cranking  through now we won't keep doing these bottom  
2:15:23
sections but instead we're going to do something  a little bit more interesting which is get our   navigation in you can see our navigation here at  the top and I could bring this over but then I'll  
2:15:31
have to custom build everything I would rather  insert a a navigation here like a really basic  
2:15:38
navigation just like so so I'm going to grab  that and I'm just going to click it's inserting   it at the bottom why don't we just press the  upare arrow and move it all the way to the  
2:15:46
top and this will be your first introduction  to components let's actually take a step back  
2:15:52
and go even simpler with components before we  dive into this navigation a little bit more on  
2:15:57
the complex side okay so we have our button here  we definitely want to turn that into a component  
2:16:02
and I can do that I can I can rightclick either on the component there or on the layer  
2:16:08
or I can hit the hotkey of command shift K turn  that in into a component and I'm going to call  
2:16:14
that button and let's just let's just call it  button CTA or something something like that we  
2:16:21
create it it's going to shoot me to our component  editing area and you can see that we're currently  
2:16:27
editing the button CTA I can very quickly go  back home how do I find these again well you  
2:16:32
can double click on any component to get back  into that editing area or you can go over to   assets and see the things that are happening  inside of your project you can double click  
2:16:41
there and it'll lead you back in there as well so  now we're editing a component and there's a couple  
2:16:46
things we can do here right we can create  new variants of this component and we can   create like cool like hover States and different  active States and different things for it so why  
2:16:55
don't we create a really simple hover State  and why don't we add like a little bit more  
2:17:00
action onto this button because I think it removed our outline which we don't want   we want to bring that outline back okay so we're  going to come into our Styles here and why don't  
2:17:11
we add a border okay so you can see here we have  border I'm going to click on that and I'm going to  
2:17:17
make it let's see we don't have any color styles  here yet why don't we bring a color style in okay  
2:17:23
so why don't we click on our orange here and  let's just copy that color style really quickly  
2:17:32
and I'm just going to draw a frame really quickly  out here and I'm going to color it this orange  
2:17:40
color and I'm going to add that to my Styles we're  going to call this primary and now we have a color  
2:17:46
style that's been made okay so let's go back into  that button and and I think we're probably going  
2:17:51
to need yet again another color style because  I think we have that light orange that's being  
2:17:56
used as well so let's get in let's find that  light orange from our design and why don't we  
2:18:05
pop that in there and again new style we're going  to call this primary light like so great create  
2:18:14
that now you can see we have two color styles and again you can find those over in your assets panel  
2:18:19
as well so we just want to make sure that we're  using all the right elements here we're really   dialing it in so let's go to our linear gradient  here and uh we want to make sure that this one is  
2:18:30
using primary light that this one is using primary  good stuff uh we like that and now let's click on  
2:18:37
our element again let's go to solid we don't want  that we want our primary light and let's go back  
2:18:43
to our border and let's do um I think solid  dashed something like that and actually we  
2:18:53
might just do a shadow instead might get rid of  that element turn on Shadow and we're not going  
2:19:01
to go X or Y we're not going to go blur but we  are going to go spread so we might do this with   a spread instead let's go primary or primary light  and bring the opacity of it down I think primary  
2:19:12
with the opacity down uh no probably the light  one I think we had that down at like 12 or 13  
2:19:17
pixels that's pretty cool and uh okay okay yeah  that's pretty good that's a little bit better  
2:19:23
I think um why don't we now make the hover state of this okay so we're going to do hover  
2:19:29
State click there on Hover and now we get to  change this button any way that we want to so  
2:19:36
you know we have our our element here and okay  great fantastic why don't we change the color  
2:19:44
of the gradient for instance why don't we just  shift like the the gradient position and see  
2:19:53
if that's kind of like obvious now when we come  back here and command P you'll notice that we just  
2:19:58
get this nice little shift of gradient in there  that's kind of cool I like that um so we can do  
2:20:03
all sorts of fun stuff here that's probably enough  for us now on that simple component we could turn   our other elements into components um and we can  even kind of add some variables or properties  
2:20:15
to our components for instance right now every  button looks like it's going to say book a free   console cuz when I get out here there's nothing  I can do about it if I try to double click to  
2:20:23
change the text going to bring me back into the  editing but what we can do is come down and you  
2:20:28
can see very similar to figma I can see the content that's inside that button says book a   free console why don't we create a variable  it's a plain text variable the default will  
2:20:39
say book a free console but we'll just write  here button label and I'm actually G to copy  
2:20:48
this and then just say button label that's what  we want actually to show up on the button and  
2:20:55
it's going to be a text area no it's going to be  a single line of text when we close this look at   that button label that looks really really good  now we can come in and so the content has been  
2:21:05
selected there and uh one of the things we can  do is we can just come in and change the style  
2:21:11
so why don't we create a paragraph text style  here and then we'll edit this and we just want  
2:21:17
to make sure this is all uppercase right so let's  go transform we'll do uppercase there we go our  
2:21:25
button label is done and we can find that textile  we just created in our sidebar here let's rename  
2:21:31
that to button text there we go button text  like that that looks really really good now  
2:21:38
you'll notice out here we have this button label and we can come down and we can replace   it with book a free consult and I'm doing this  in lowercase and when I update it because we  
2:21:50
set that text style as uppercase it's always  going to just transfer everything or convert  
2:21:56
everything now let's mess with this header  that we have up here because it looks very   very different or navigation from our current  navigation right so we're going to double click  
2:22:06
on that and you'll notice it is a component and  when I zoom out I have a desktop and I have a  
2:22:12
mobile I have mo mobile versions of both open  and closed and they've already baked in the  
2:22:18
interactions for me which is really really nice  okay so when I go here and press preview on my  
2:22:24
website you'll see it shrink down and nothing  is happening right now because currently this  
2:22:30
is set to be our desktop size you can see our  variant down here it's using desktop it could  
2:22:35
switch over to one of the other sizes the mobile  size the phone size when it does that it changes  
2:22:42
the variant that we have there so why is it not working when our size shifts down   well that's because we haven't added a new break  point so if we go here we can say hey give me the  
2:22:51
tablet breakpoint of my design and it's going  to put that right next to my current design  
2:22:56
and it's going to do its best to make things  responsive so you're learning two things right   now how to add new breakpoints and start to do  some of that responsive design work and then how  
2:23:05
to actually maintain and create different  types of components have different states  
2:23:12
depending on the size and so here we go we've set  our tablet size here we can come in and select our  
2:23:18
our navigation and why don't we swap that over to  our phone view just like so now when we preview  
2:23:25
our desktop version as it starts to get down and  you'll notice that top number when it hits 810  
2:23:31
it's actually going to kick over just like it did  right there boom into our desktop variant it reads  
2:23:38
the media query or the size of the browser and  it understands that it's time to implement this   already interactive navigation bar that's been created for us so now all we get to do is come  
2:23:48
in and update this navigation to match our own  which means we're going to need a few things  
2:23:53
we're going to need our logo here so why don't we  just export this out and we'll call this logo.png  
2:24:01
if you have an SVG version even better but  we're just going to drag that PNG version   in here like so going to cut that command X and  we're just going to come in here and let's look  
2:24:13
at how this thing is built you'll notice over  here we have a bunch of different um a bunch   of different Auto layouts or Stacks as they call  them here inside a framer I'm going to paste that  
2:24:22
inside let's get rid of the old framer logo we  have that there that feels really really good  
2:24:28
okay let's zoom out and what do we want to do  here we want these links we actually probably  
2:24:33
want the whole thing to not distribute to  the start the start being the leftand side  
2:24:39
we don't want it to be the end right that's  going to be the right hand side we want it   to be probably space between and look at that it's gone ahead and spaced everything out for us  
2:24:49
now we get to over to our right hand side and  just make our updates here right so we don't   have we only have three pages and why don't we  go into our assets and grab our button that we  
2:25:01
made and drag one of those in here as well put  that on the right hand side great that's looking  
2:25:07
pretty good and now what we want to do is grab the  entire thing and let's just check and see we have  
2:25:13
a little bit of padding on our logo here we could  probably remove all of that padding it's shoving  
2:25:21
everything to the edges here we can grab the  entire element here and put some padding on   the left and right hand sides let's go zero on  top zero on bottom and let's hide this we'll  
2:25:34
just jump in and go 20 pixels on the left and  right hand side now you can see a little bit  
2:25:40
of that padding that feels really really good  and we're probably going to want to update this   so how about book a free consult like so and  we can change our pages to about gallery and  
2:25:50
contact so why don't we zoom in and change this really quickly we could do about Gallery if  
2:26:02
I could spell at all and contact something like  that and now these three text links are probably  
2:26:11
the wrong color so let's change the color of  those and we going to need a black color and  
2:26:16
since we're making a black color why don't we just  create a color style out of that create that boom  
2:26:22
it's using our color style it has our text our uh  text links inside one we bump this up to 10 on the  
2:26:28
top 10 on the bottom just a little bit of spacing  and then our height why don't we have it fit the  
2:26:33
content it's going to respect that padding just  a little bit we come back home look at that we   have a beautiful navigation up top here with  our button in it and we can just push things  
2:26:44
down to the build now we're getting the wrong  order for some reason we get down to our our   navigation or our mobile navigation but we can  fix that right we can double click on our mobile  
2:26:54
one and see that we just have things a little  bit wonky and a little bit out of place so why   don't we just swap those around and now things are in the right place and we get some beautiful  
2:27:05
responsive nature now we also talked about the  issues with responsive text we said let's let   framer do all of that and sure enough we're going  to let framer do all of that right now because  
2:27:14
you'll notice that our navigation is changing  but our text sizes are not oh that's not good  
2:27:20
so first thing we're going to do is come in  and we're going to grab our piece of text   here and we don't have a text style set up for  it let's create a new style and that is our  
2:27:29
H1 style and when I click edit here and we  zoom out just a little bit there's all sorts  
2:27:35
of things we can change the font the weight all  the details but those have been brought over for   us as we brought everything over from figma so  do we want to balance it do we want this to be  
2:27:44
open type there's all sorts of different options  really cool stuff here inside a framer but one   of the things I really love is do we want to  add break points yes I do as soon as I press  
2:27:53
that you'll notice there was a change in my document right when we go back do it again we  
2:27:58
see that all of a sudden we have a large  size which our size is 128 and it's gone   ahead and done some of the smart math for us  it goes hey this should probably be about 102  
2:28:06
when you get down to that medium size now what  about our small size why don't we create a new   breakpoint for mobile and zoom up to the top  it's still using that size so let's come here  
2:28:18
really quickly edit our size and we don't have a  another breakpoint here we need to add that next  
2:28:25
breakpoint the small breakpoint just by right  clicking and adding I went ahead and did that   now I have we go from as you could see 128 to  102 to 82 so it's making those recommendations  
2:28:38
for you and you can change them to your  heart's content but a lot of times out of   the box the recommendations are good what  else do we have to do to make this section  
2:28:46
work and be responsive well let's just play  with the image size a little bit pull this   up same thing here we'll pull this up I like it  a lot I think it's working really really well  
2:28:56
now we come and just close up our sections  let's click into our mobile one we're going  
2:29:03
to see we have our lock up here and we have  our entire header our header is holding on to  
2:29:08
the same padding left and right top and bottom  as our desktop is and this is different from  
2:29:14
maybe other Web Design Systems where you know  you set it once and maybe there's some sort of   like percentage you you can totally do percentages  here if you want to but I find the easiest way is  
2:29:24
just to do a little change here so I'm going to go into my header and left and right let's go from   64 down to maybe 44 notice how this went blue if I  want to I can always reset these uh usually pretty  
2:29:38
easily we'll see or we can just come into this one  as well so let's go into our our header for mobile  
2:29:44
and take those down to not 64 not 44 but more like  24 now we're utilizing the real estate there a lot  
2:29:51
more the line height on my text is a little bit  wonky I think maybe I'd want to come back and fix   that but for the most part we've actually just created pretty decent responsive nature responsive  
2:30:02
typography or adaptive typography responsive  layout here and responsive navigation and  
2:30:07
all we have to do is go in and update those  navigation elements design them however we   want them and they will reflect here as well  we also have some interactive elements here  
2:30:16
why don't we do just a few more things and then  we will end otherwise we could spend hours here   building this whole thing out what I want to do  is I'm currently each one of my rows uh is set  
2:30:27
in their own individual row and so I could  actually grab these out of the rows for my  
2:30:34
value propositions here and I can bring them  together like so and I can grab this whole row  
2:30:42
this element we probably don't need it the  way that it's being built there actually we   can bring it back in there delete the second  row we don't need that and let's set this to  
2:30:50
be grid and in our desktop version here uh  which is what we're working on we can set it  
2:30:56
to four columns and then because we've done that  you'll notice there it's being reflected in all   of the artboards on the right hand side it's  listening and you can override them as you go  
2:31:05
down on those smaller artboards so let's come over  here and let's change this now to a two column and  
2:31:12
then we get over here to our mobile view let's  change this to a one column okay and again we  
2:31:18
can come in here and change our type of typography  so notice our typography here I'm actually just   going to lock our Polynesian tribal element that's  there so I stopped clicking on it and I think we  
2:31:29
called this one our H2 didn't we so let me see this is our H2 so why don't we add that new style  
2:31:36
I'm going to select and just create a new style  that's our heading to and you can have multiple  
2:31:42
H1s multiple H2S although you probably don't  want to and we can add those break points and  
2:31:47
so you can see we have immediate sizing break  points as go down that looks really really good  
2:31:52
the next thing we need to do is just make sure  that things are sized properly now you notice   we're getting really weird Behavior with  our text and it's stretching out on our  
2:31:59
mobile past our our container now that's a pretty  good Telltale sign that you have things set to a  
2:32:05
fixed width and it's trying to honor that width  so I like to go all the way back up the mountain   the top of the mountain to the desktop there  and just check it out and sure enough look  
2:32:13
it's fixed so instead why don't we set that  to fill the space and you can see it doesn't  
2:32:18
make a lot of change here on our desktop  but it made a huge change over here on our   mobile version same thing here we're going to fill and it's trying to respect that 771 where  
2:32:28
is it getting that well we came over here we  manually fixed the size here right so it tried  
2:32:33
to manually fix the size for us as well and so  that's a good note that we could do it that way   back in figma we could have probably just added  a maximum width we could do that here right now  
2:32:42
so why don't we set this to fill and then we can  add that Max width of 77 pixels and let's try that  
2:32:51
again Max width of 770 pixels when I say good it's  going to go ahead and make sure it Max widths  
2:32:58
here we get that nice flow over here in our  mobile views now again this is where we can  
2:33:04
start to add some of those variations of padding  we made those variations of padding to our top  
2:33:11
section we can do that here to our bottom section  as well our y section has 64 pixels here when we  
2:33:17
come to the tablet we drop down to 44 and we get  over to our mobile could drop down to 24 right  
2:33:26
and we're going to get really consistent padding  and spacing on each of these device sizes okay we  
2:33:31
can also change all the gaps all the spacing everything there this one's going to be really   easy for this layout we just want to make  sure that we're moving for the direction  
2:33:38
of our stack in again in figma they call them  Auto layouts and framer they call them Stacks   let's move that to a vertical Direction stack  and then let's uh we can even manipulate the  
2:33:49
size uh of the height of our element here let's  unlock it and just drag it up and then set the  
2:33:58
image to not stretch like that but instead fill  and now we get really really responsive stuff and   you probably want to set that that behavior of  fill at the top level and it'll Cascade down  
2:34:09
across all of the different screen sizes and  resolutions that feels pretty good um and we  
2:34:14
can actually you know like take the same thing  and do the same the same layout choice we made  
2:34:20
and do it over here on mobile and again we  have that fixed width text so we're going   to have to come in here and just say hey  make sure that you fill that space that  
2:34:28
fixes it on our smaller device sizes and then  we can come in and do our spacing so 44 for  
2:34:34
a section and then 24 left and right for our  mobile and a couple little tweaks and changes  
2:34:41
here like our text is probably a little too small  you can't even read that it says 25 years let's  
2:34:47
just push that up and we can barely read it here  so why don't we push it up like that looks pretty  
2:34:54
good we zoom into our mobile we probably want  to push that up a little bit more and this is  
2:34:59
where we might actually even start thinking  about changing the sizing or the padding   for the top and bottom of our containers but we can leave that be for now okay uh same thing  
2:35:09
is happening here this is looking pretty good I  think we have this in a grid why don't we just   in our mobile view move this over to a two column  grid love that and we don't want it to be a fixed  
2:35:20
size we want it to fill the space same thing is  going to happen here fill the space and something  
2:35:28
else is going on we're inside of like a parent  container that is for some reason fitting and  
2:35:35
got to make a couple little changes here maybe it  has massive amounts of padding on it no I don't   think so everything seems to be fine there bump  that up our little Polynesian band up there to  
2:35:47
the top and figure out why our content is not  fully like filling the space here so let's go  
2:35:55
here fit if we do 100% here yeah that didn't  quite work so something is telling me that it  
2:36:04
is a fixed width and that that is very very wrong  so let's it's the gallery itself is fitting the  
2:36:10
content instead of filling so that's the  real issue we just realized right there   fit and fill are very very similar words but they're not doing the same thing so instead we  
2:36:19
want to fill and now you'll see immediately  it fills the container the way it's supposed   to and it fills our issue over here same thing  text is broken that's okay we can fill it why  
2:36:28
don't we just lock our poly really quick our  tribal up there really quickly and then again   set to fill we could do the same thing here we  could fill we could set that minimum maximum  
2:36:39
width again of course do the whole thing and  we need the container that those are in the   parent container to fills where and then boom it  fixes everything there let's change our padding  
2:36:48
here again 44 and down here to 24 24 and one  more over boom 24 we fixed that and we have  
2:37:01
this at a two column grid let's just quickly grab  this and drop it down to a one column grid and   look at that we should have a fairly responsive  website across the board everything is ebbing and  
2:37:13
flowing nicely could fix these to fit a little  bit more if we had more time these are moving  
2:37:19
in and changing columns those are really beautiful and nice our layout   here is turning from a two column to a one  column okay super nice the same thing with  
2:37:29
our Gallery here we have three down to two down  to a one column Gallery beautiful like that we  
2:37:36
loving that the last thing we might want to do  is add a couple of custom little interactions   maybe some animations to this to maybe spice  the whole thing up and that's really easy to  
2:37:45
do inside a framer as well I can actually grab  these and just head over like this top section  
2:37:50
here let's do a nice entrance animation so I'm going to make that top piece appear   on a it's going to fade in and we can kind of  play with the effect there a little bit right  
2:38:01
now it's disappearing it's showing us where it's  coming from we don't want to scale down we want  
2:38:06
it to offset y by see do about 30 maybe 20 and  we can change the easing and timing but let's  
2:38:14
just test it out and see how it looks we'll  press play you get a nice little animation  
2:38:19
there why don't we reload that so you can see  going to animate in we can delay that why don't   we come in here really quickly on effect grab  the spring and then we can just add a little  
2:38:30
bit of a delay maybe a05 second delay we press  play it waits and then it pops up let's reload  
2:38:37
beautiful we could take that same effect if we  really like it and this is what's really cool   we just copy that effect and we can grab other  elements here and we can paste the same effect  
2:38:48
on it just like that do the same thing here let's  find paste effect and maybe we want to do the same  
2:38:54
thing with the button paste effect now all of those have the similar effect on them we can go  
2:39:00
through and change the delay on them if you want  or you do it all at once I'd like to change the   delay on it a little bit I think so we'll just  change the delay here to this one to be maybe2  
2:39:12
seconds and then this one will be and notice as  we start to edit them they just keep you here   I'm going to make this one 04 seconds I'm going  to make this one 6 seconds and our button going  
2:39:21
to come up in8 seconds so we should get  a nice staggered entrance animation just  
2:39:28
like that beautiful I love it feels really  good why don't we actually grab our element   down below as well we'll do another effect and  maybe we'll say uh scroll animation or scroll  
2:39:39
speed so let's do scroll animation when the  layer is in view we don't want it to replay  
2:39:45
we want it to fade in we want to scale in let's  do scale in and the entrance animation is going  
2:39:50
to look like this we can choose the scale maybe  like that the opacity could be maybe not all the  
2:39:56
way down but slightly down and why don't we 3D skew this thing really quickly so we'll   just move it you know maybe the x axis so and  a little bit on the Y AIS this is not going to  
2:40:08
be the type of Animation I would recommend but  it I think it will showcase and highlight you  
2:40:13
know the uh the abilities that we have here  so let's try that really quickly let's just  
2:40:19
see see it was very very fast let's try it again  okay great and I'm just going to change one thing  
2:40:25
I'm going to make it not when it's in view  but when we get maybe to the middle of that   element so it won't actually it shouldn't actually  fire till we get to the bottom of it let's change  
2:40:35
it there there we go you can see it's waiting for  us and as we get the bottom is exposed should a  
2:40:43
fired there we go it finally fired so we could  play with the the timing of this one a little bit  
2:40:49
and let's do here layer in view great or how  about on scroll we could do it that way as  
2:40:55
well and we just want to delay this a little bit  let's just delay and actually I don't like that  
2:41:04
spin so let's just come in here and take the spin off of it and we'll just keep the  
2:41:12
element happening un let's just do maybe layer  in view section in view maybe layer in view like  
2:41:18
that one more time time there we go as soon as  it was in view it scaled up to it that's pretty   cool effect I like that and we can do the same  our thing is already moving here we can do the  
2:41:27
same for each one of our little elements here  and again you can componentize those you're   working on one and just updating the content  and our layouts are all there and we will stop  
2:41:37
there actually because there is a little bit  more work that could be done to finish this   but I think that you get the point here we have  created a fairly responsive successful design  
2:41:47
and we've done all of it in very short amount  of time using framer and all of that has come   from our Custom Design over inside of figma  the last step of this process is to publish  
2:41:57
your website by hitting that big blue button in  the top right hand corner and when you do that   framer is going to give you a staging domain you can also add your own custom domain but  
2:42:06
you're able to send this staging domain to your  clients link it up to their custom domain and then  
2:42:12
you can improve or upgrade that account to a paid  account so you get access to SEO localization CMS  
2:42:18
all sorts of really cool stuff but this website is  basically minutes away from being published live  
2:42:25
to the web and this process although it's gone  through many iterations over the years because  
2:42:30
the tooling has changed and maybe some of the  gear the tips and the tricks and the products   have changed the process has remained the same  it's solving problems through that four-step  
2:42:41
process and again that four-step process looks  like strategy structure design and development  
2:42:47
and now right now at this moment in history  you as a web designer are able to do all of  
2:42:52
that to make a really good living doing that and  to make amazing projects and fill your portfolio  
2:42:58

okay welcome to the web design business course my name is Marshall malava I'm your trainer your Mentor your helper
0:07
whatever it is that you want to call me and I'm going to be showing you how you can build a business building websites
0:12
and how exactly you're going to be getting paid right so everything that you want to know about starting a web design business you're going to learn it
0:18
in this quick short course uh maybe you're here because you saw an advert on Tik Tok uh maybe on YouTube you're
0:26
watching maybe some of my content somewhere and you're wondering if you're supposed to be here um is this the right
0:31
place for you to learn about how to do web design how to build websites as a business uh without coding and without
0:39
having to go to school to learn how to do web design if you if you're actually wondering then definitely this is the
0:45
best place that you need to be in to actually learn that but first let's define what web design is uh what's a
0:53
web design business and then I'm going to introduce you to Creator HQ the software that you'll be using that will
0:59
help you right to get into web design without going to school to learn how to
1:04
do coding and without you having to actually code in fact actually within a few minutes you'll be able to build uh
1:11
websites after I teach you what I need to teach you here so let's start off by defining what web design is if I just
What is website design
1:16
come to Google and then I just type something like um gy uh near me let's say that I'm
1:23
interested in going to the gym right and I'm looking for a gym that's near my location and I want to see what they
1:29
have to offer just by typing in that in Google I'm able to see all these
1:34
different links to different websites that offer trainings or training facilities uh for example like a gym so
1:41
let's let's look at this one it's Zone Fitness if I click on Zone Fitness it's going to open up their website and as
1:47
you can see what consists of a website is firstly there's this menu option at the top where you can get details about
1:53
different things Zone fitness clubs shows you the different clubs in the location in different locations then it
1:58
shows you different training programs timetables you can join now about vacancies blogs and news so it's
2:05
basically a platform where you can come and find all the details that you want to know about this company there's a
2:11
nice big image there the different things that they're offering as you can see cardio Fight Night boot camp there's
2:17
um the pricing there you can click on join now and because I'm in cap toown it shows me Cape toown at the top but then
2:23
it also just shows different pictures of all these different locations and so the reason why someone would want to get a
2:28
website for their business is because as you can see I am based right now in Cape Town and I'm in a certain location I'm
2:36
able to see all the different locations that are available to me so I don't physically have to go there to find out
2:43
let's say maybe I want to move to a new area I don't physically have to move to maybe Philippi or prominade to then go
2:48
to the GM and see what's available I can see all that information online so websites are important because it helps
2:54
people to advertise their businesses uh online 24/7 um
3:00
365 365 days a year people don't have to physically go to the location to find
3:06
out information they can find out all the information that they want from a website so that's just an example of why
3:12
websites are very important and this is a type of website that you actually will be able to uh build and so just by doing
3:18
this training I'm going to show you this tool and this is the tool that we're going to be using it's called Creator HQ it's going to allow you to build any
3:25
type of website they're going to be beautiful websites amazing websites and uh yeah you'll be able to do them within
3:31
minutes just by using this tool so yeah the platform that we'll be using is called Creator HQ and as you can see
3:36
it's an it's an Allin one platform in other words all you need to run your business online everything that helps
3:43
businesses to run online you'll be able to use this tool to do that so you can build websites you can do email
3:49
marketing you can put um products and people can sell their products whether they are physical products or there are
3:55
products that maybe you just download for example like uh an online course or an ebook so everything that has to do
4:01
with allowing a business to be able to sell online they'll be able to do it through Creator HQ so I'm just going to
4:07
introduce to so I'm just going to introduce it to you quickly but then I'm just going to also do an overview later
4:12
in the next video so it's just this platform and so that you know UPF front this is the platform that people sign up
4:18
for for example if I come here where and I click on uh plans and pricing you will notice that there are three different
4:24
pricing plans um if you can you can check the pricing for the yearly or the monthly if I change that to monthly you
4:31
see that people will be signing up here for $49 per month or $79 per month so
4:36
you can just go through this to see the different things that they are going to be getting but the way that it works is
4:41
when someone signs up they can just sign up for free which you are also going to need to do and then you'll be able to
4:48
use this platform to build your own website so let me just also just say this right up front so that you know
4:53
what you're getting into this is a software and tool that you will need to pay for in other words every single month if you're choosing to pay month to
5:00
month it's going to be $49 a month if you choose to choose pay for the whole year you're going to be paying $39 per
5:05
month so if you're looking for a free tool that if you're looking for so if you're looking for a tool that you're going to use for free for the rest of
5:11
your life but you're going to be making money this is not it maybe you should just stop doing the course right now
5:16
this is a tool that's going to allow you firstly to build your own website I'll show you how to do that and then while
5:22
building your website you will learn how to build websites for other people and then you get paid so maybe your first
5:27
month you are thinking okay will I be able to pay off these $39 or $49 every single month you are going to be getting
5:34
that money from building websites for other people that's if you do the work that I will show you in this in these videos and I show you how to actually
5:40
get clients if you go out and get those clients you definitely will become profitable and you won't have to worry
5:46
about paying this but if you're just looking for a free platform that you just sit on have a nice website and you
5:51
don't go and look for clients or anything then maybe this is not the right course or is not the right platform that you need to be using and
5:58
so if you're going to succeed there basically three things that you're going to need to have the first one is that you need to have Creator HQ and I've
6:04
just shown you right now you can sign up for it and get uh 14 day free trial meaning that you're not going to pay for
6:10
anything for the first 14 days definitely if you do the work if you do exactly what I'm going to show you in this few in this few training videos
6:16
you're going to be profitable and you're not going to be worrying about paying every single month the second thing that you're going to need to succeed is
6:22
you're going to have to have a company and your company consists of um your company name and then a domain and then
6:28
a logo and I'm going to show you to get those and then lastly you need to have a business mentality so when I talk about
6:34
like a company name it's the same as as this platform that we're using it's called Creator HQ myself I've got my own
6:40
company it's called malaba Uh media and this is my website right here I'm going to be reviewing it later on so that you
6:47
are clear on what exactly do you need to include when you're building a website but basically that's the name that I'm
6:53
I'm choosing to use you can have any type of of name I'll give you ideas on how you can get your company name but
6:59
you just need a company name and then you need to have a logo so can you see here I'm just using this logo it's just my name malava media but when we come
7:05
back to this one this is the creator HQ logo Zone Fitness this is the Zone Fitness logo so you need to have that
7:12
have your company name have your logo and then lastly a domain a domain is this here this is your your address
7:19
online your internet address so that when people type this in they'll be able to find your website so I'm going to
7:24
show you how to get all that done and the last thing that you then will need to have is the business mentality you
7:29
need to have a business mentality you need to go into this knowing that this is a business this is not something that
7:34
you are just jumping into for fun and it's just going to happen by itself so the first thing I want to mention that
7:40
is that you're not going to succeed overnight if you're looking for something that you can just do today and then tomorrow morning you start making
7:46
money maybe you want to make money so that you can go out and have fun by the weekend this is not it right this is actually setting up a full business
7:53
where you're going to be earning income by building businesses for other businesses you're going to be building websites for other businesses and that
8:00
doesn't happen overnight think of any successful company that you know you look at the entrepreneurs there or the
8:05
the the the company owner then say one day I want to be like that person I guarantee you it took them a lot of
8:11
years to become the person that you that you are looking at and saying I wish to be like this person one time so it's not
8:16
going to happen overnight it's going to take time it's going to take effort but definitely the results will be sweet
8:21
right when you do this work when you learn how to build a website learn how to find clients definitely you're going
8:26
to have a good time it's going to be sweet you'll be able to to to do everything that you've ever dreamed of doing and it's going to be awesome now
8:33
when I started doing this I didn't have a mentor right I didn't have anyone was teaching me this so I had to learn all
8:38
this stuff by myself but luckily for you I'm here to Mentor you to train you to show you how to actually get all this
8:44
done so that what's going to happen you are going to succeed and so I've been working in this industry for about seven
8:49
years now and I'll tell you something the ones who succeed are the ones who will first of all learn how to
8:55
understand the platform they'll learn how to use the platform for themselves they'll play around with the platform uh
9:01
just be able to do anything and then they go out and they and they find clients so if you're just looking for something that is just done for you
9:08
totally and there's nothing that you have to do this is not it you have to learn the platform you have to learn how
9:13
to use it and that's why you need to take advantage of the trial period and you need to take advantage of the training videos I'm going to show you a
9:19
couple of places where you can get some training videos you learn quickly how to use the platform and then it becomes
9:24
easy for you to be able to do anything for any type of client and you're going to be earning some good money and let me tell you also the first few days and the
9:31
first few weeks are usually the hardest because a lot of you doing this trading maybe you've never built websites before
9:37
so you're going to be learning a totally new skill but hey with every single type of skill you first of all start off as a
9:43
beginner but the more effort you put the more work you put into it you then become an expert you become better and
9:49
better and better so it's all about you being willing to put in the effort the first few weeks you might not get it you
9:56
might not understand but if you keep showing up and trying you going to succeed that's what we call a business
10:01
mentality you have to think of it like a business let's say you are employed in a business you have to wake up in the morning and go right you work a certain
10:08
couple of hours per day when you're done you then go home and do whatever you want but next day you need to do the
10:15
same thing over and over again until you get to a point whereby you're able to do the thing whatever your job type is
10:20
until you're doing it without even thinking because it's now natural and it's just easy for you so you have to be
10:26
prepared to sign up for the software and then learn it and then Master it and then let me tell you what's going to happen you'll see like in the group some
10:33
people will actually post and say that maybe in the first week they got their first client maybe someone will say that in the first month they got the first
10:39
client but maybe for you because it's totally new and different to you it might take you two months it might take
10:44
you three months I know if you get an understanding of how this all works you can do it even in the space of a week
10:50
getting your first client but because we're all different people it will take time for some other people but what I
10:55
want to encourage you to do is don't give up keep pushing keep doing what you need to do and you will succeed that's
11:01
how businesses start when you look at a great business it's not about how they started the only thing we consider is
11:07
that they are a great business so that's just some encouragement for you that you need to have a business mentality and
11:12
the results will come for you when you learn the platform Master it and then
11:18
you do the work of getting clients which I'm going to show you how to do and then you're going to get start you're going to start in this lesson we're going to
11:24
cover a quick overview of the platform how to register how to start using it so
Overview of the platform
11:29
that you get started as quick as possible so I'm going to put the link in the description below of this video but
11:35
the other option is for you to just simply go to create a hq.com and then you're going to click on any one of the
11:40
options that say start free trial something that I just want to mention quickly is like I mentioned at the start
11:45
of this training you're going to have to select one of the monthly plans here so there's the yearly plans and then
11:51
there's the monthly plans so if you want to pay month to month you just make sure that it's on the monthly plan so that
11:57
you see um which one it is that you're going to be using but if you do want to pay for the yearly plan that's fine but
12:03
notice that you're going to start off with a 14-day trial you're not going to be paying anything at the start right so
12:10
you just come here and you click on start free trial and it's going to bring you to this page where it's going to ask you to
12:17
register so you're just going to add a name add your email address and then add a password and then click where it says
12:23
I am not a robot as you can see I'm just using some fake details here just for demonstration purposes and then it's
12:29
going to bring you to this page here where it's going to ask you to choose a template so when you're building a website for yourself or for your clients
12:36
this is what they are going to see so as we grow we're going to be adding more templates but basically these are the
12:41
templates that are there for now so you just simply come here and you choose which template you want to work with
12:48
let's say maybe I'm interested in this one that says yoga you can just click here where it says preview so that you can just get a basic overview of what
12:55
the website will look like when you have finished setting it up so it's you can see this is what the Yoga website will
13:00
look like the images the text um this whatever you want to call these these
13:06
icons or logos what you want whatever you want to call them so this is the basic layout of how the website is going
13:12
to look like so you can choose to work with this template then what will happen is once you choose it you start editing
13:17
it but what I recommend that you do is that you come here where it says Consulting these are the templates that
13:23
are mainly for people who are Consultants or as you can see awesome website design these SE are the mainly
13:29
Tech based uh websites so you can click on where it says consulting or you click on where it says services and you just
13:36
simply choose whichever template that you want to work with myself I like to use uh very simple easy templates so I
13:42
don't like complicated things so for example maybe I'll just come and choose this one here that I see right here I'll
13:48
click on preview and I'll just go through it quickly and if I like it I'll just choose it and at the moment I like
13:53
it so I'm just going to click where now says start with this theme at the top here then it's going to ask me to add a title and I'm just going to call this uh
14:01
malaba T but you can get to call it the name of your website the name that you
14:07
chosen for your business click on submit and the next thing it will then do is that it's going to bring you to this page here and the first thing that will
14:13
happen is that there's going to be this video that's going to pop up what I recommend that you do is that you just simply play press play and watch the
14:19
video one of my partners created this video explaining how to actually use and edit the platform so just feel free to
14:26
just watch this video and check it out it will help you to understand okay how exactly I'm going to be am I going to be
14:31
editing everything here next it's going to bring you to this page here which falls under the Builder section as you
14:37
can see highlighted by the red here this is basically the website that you have
14:42
set up it's based on the template that you have chosen and as you can see the website actually has been completed all
14:49
you just simply need to do is just is just come in here and then just edit everything that you want to change for
14:54
example if I want to change the text right here all I just simply need to do is just click on the text
14:59
and then I can start editing I can just delete that and then maybe type something like the best
15:07
website service in the world whatever I want to
15:12
write right obviously you're going to be checking to make sure that your spellings are correct and everything and then you just delete everything else
15:18
that you don't want and as you can see I've already started editing my text
15:23
right there if I want to delete something for example this section here if I just click on that I can just this
15:29
option will pop up which says delete and I click on it and I say yes and as you can see it's been deleted as you can see
15:35
there's this line here divide line if I want to change the distance between the C to action button at the bottom and the
15:41
divider line I just simply need to hover over the C action this red option appears and I can just drag this like
15:48
that as you can see let's say maybe I want to add some form of content I can just click here where it says plus this
15:56
is basically all your widgets and I'm just going to look for what ever type of content I want to add so basically
16:01
you'll be able to edit anything that you see here change it play around with it and I will be showing you how to
16:07
actually set up your website in the next video but I just wanted to do a quick over overview so let me jump right here
16:14
to the end where it says Academy if you click on Academy you will notice okay it's going to ask me to stay and save
16:20
first I'm just going to click on save those changes so that whatever I edited will be saved make sure that every
16:26
single time when you're editing something when you're done editing one thing click on Save otherwise let's say
16:32
maybe there's a power cut or something you might lose your progress if you don't click on Save now let's come here
16:38
where it says Academy if I click on Academy it's going to bring me to this page here where there are video
16:44
tutorials that show me everything I can do with this software for example if I want to create a website I'm still going
16:50
to do a quick video on how to do a website but this is more in-depth training so I can just click here where
16:56
it says watch the series and it's just going to be a series series of videos that will show me everything that I need
17:02
to know about building a website for example choosing a template building my homepage building the inner Pages
17:10
generating leads for my business forms appointments everything that you need to know about setting up your website
17:17
including even SEO and then getting found online so just come here at the top and click on Academy and watch the
17:23
different trainings they will give you all the trainings that you need to know about this platform and how to use if
17:29
you want to know how to set up emails and automations as you can see the videos are there creating funnels in
17:34
fact even setting up e-commerce stores for example if you want to use this platform for selling or doing Drop
17:40
Shipping and there even some web design tips that will just give you some great tips about how to actually uh succeed in
17:47
terms of web design and then there's also the section for setting up memberships or helping people to
17:52
actually sell their courses online now when we come back here where it says store store is basically where you're
17:58
going to be setting up your payment gateways I'm going to talk about this later on payment Gateway is what you use
18:03
to receive and make payments uh online I'm going to give you examples of the ones that you can sign up for that will
18:09
work with this platform but basically when I just click on connect and I say add payment provider as you can see
18:16
these are all the different payment providers that you can sign up with so depending on which country you're
18:21
watching this from you can sign up with stripe brain tree to checkout whatever you just name it you can just easily
18:27
sign up it's super simple and easy to do and also you'll be able to create products products are basically what you
18:33
are going to be selling so by default these are the ones that are there but then you can come in here and then edit
18:38
and create new products and I'll show you how to do that later and basically that's where you're going to be adding the price and once the product is added
18:44
it's connected to the payment to the payment Gateway and then you'll be able to receive payments immediately contacts
18:50
is the place where you all the people who register on your website will be able to be found for example if someone
18:55
buys something or order something on your site all their details are going to appear here so so basically this is like
19:01
a CRM where you can get all the details about your customers and everything that you need to know about them the next one
19:07
is appointments you'll be able to set up appointments uh in this section and as usual there's a video that pops up and
19:13
explains to you how you can actually set this up make sure you watch the video so that you're clear on how exactly that's
19:19
going to work but basically you just setting up events and people can then come and book calls with you register
19:25
and talk to you and then you can sign them on as as customer or you can be doing your coaching or whatever it is
19:31
that you're going to be using the platform for then there's emails and automations emails and automations are
19:36
what you're going to be using to set up for example if someone comes and registers for something on your website
19:41
you don't have to reply them immediately you can actually use emails and automations to automatically reply them
19:47
to give them the information that they're asking for so once again there's a video here that will explain everything that you need to know about
19:53
that something that I just want to mention briefly is in terms of the payments for the platform you'll notice
20:00
like at the bottom here it says trial account upgrade now so this is always going to appear as long as you're using
20:07
a trial and it only disappears once you have started making your own payments now let's say you want to review your
20:13
website to see what it will actually look like when you are done you can just click on this I which says website
20:18
preview and it will bring you here and you can view it here but I usually like to just say show in a new tab so that it
20:25
actually shows you what it's going to look like obviously first you going to need to change this so that is actually your name and I'll show you how to do
20:31
that uh in one of the next videos but you will notice right here at the bottom right corner there's this thing that
20:38
says start your free trial this is always going to appear to show you that this is actually uh a trial version of
20:45
your website so you don't want this to appear this will actually be there until you actually make your first payment but
20:51
it doesn't stop you from actually building your whole website you can go ahead build your whole website and even start getting some clients if you want
20:58
but I I think it's kind of annoying and it doesn't make sense when you see this thing appearing here and the second
21:03
thing that you also need to know is after the trial period ends all this will not be visible you just be getting
21:09
a page where it says that this website does not exist so you don't want to get to that stage and this lesson we're
21:14
going to be talking about choosing your business name that's basically choosing the name that you're going to be using
Choosing a name & logo
21:20
to run your business now if I show you my own example I personally use my
21:25
surname and then I just added the word media and then it's.org but also you can
21:31
search for it as um so basically my website is just simple it just mainly focuses on the problem that I'm trying
21:39
to solve and don't worry I'm going to talk about all this later on and I'll actually use this website as an example
21:44
just to show you guys um it's not really complicated to do this but the first
21:50
thing that I just want to mention is that don't put too much time in effort into finding a name too many people focus on what's the perfect name to get
21:57
what's the perfect logo to get but honestly people really don't care about your business name they really don't
22:03
care about your logo they just care about what they can get from you or what they benefit from you or how exactly you
22:09
help them so here are three examples there's Apple there's YouTube and there's Mercedes-Benz Apple when you
22:15
think of an apple do you think of a laptop no when you think of an apple do you think of uh a phone you don't right
22:23
so it's just a name it's just a name and a logo you don't have to overthink it
22:28
right no one buys Apple because the logo is amazing or world class they buy it because of what the products do for them
22:35
same thing with YouTube YouTube is a platform where we go and watch uh great content about anything you don't go
22:40
there because the logo is red or it's it's written nicely you go there because you want video content so even if this
22:47
logo was purple or it was green or there was this this basically means play if if
22:52
this was a bicycle no one would care people just care about what do they get from that uh business here's another one
22:59
mercedesbenz what does this have to do with the car now when you see this you obviously know it's mercedesbenz but
23:05
what does this have to do with the car it's got absolutely nothing to do with the car so in other words what makes the logo great is what your business does
23:12
and not the logo itself so don't overthink about uh what's my name or
23:18
what's my business uh for too long it shouldn't even take you more than uh maybe a few minutes or a couple of hours
23:24
to come up with your name so you have some ideas for coming up with your logo name use your name I use mine it's
23:31
malaba media so it can be your surname and then you can just add like the word media at the end and there other
23:37
keywords that you can also use for example Tech or systems I could say malava systems I could say malava Tech
23:43
but I chose malava media so that's just an example of how you can just get your name or you can choose something that
23:49
doesn't have to do with your your own name like you can just call yourself web Tech or web systems or anything that
23:56
just it helps you to it when someone hears it okay they know that okay this has to do with something to do with
24:01
technology or software and like I said don't overthink it don't spend too much
24:06
time there so now in terms of like okay how do you exactly do you design the logo once you decide to own your name
24:13
there's this tool that I use which is called canva anyone can sign up for this website for free they've got a paid plan
24:19
but let me tell you you don't need the paid plan you can just use this for free so you're just going to Simply come to this website here and as you can see
24:28
here says sign up for free you just click on that button or sometimes it's at the top right corner wherever it says
24:33
sign up for free you just simply sign up and then when you're inside this is what it looks like as you can see I've got a
24:38
lot of designs that are in here this is what I use for creating my YouTube thumbnails uh for banners anything to do
24:44
with Graphic Design This is basically the tool that I use and I'm using it for free of course there are many other gra
24:49
graphic design tools that you can use there but why use them if you can get this for free the reason why I'm showing
24:54
you this is let's say that I want to design a logo you can just simply come here and say logo right I just typed in
25:01
the word the logo and then it's going to show me all these different types of logos I can actually type and say logo
25:07
templates but I'm just going to look for the one that says technology logos and I click on that and what it will do is
25:12
that it's going to show me all these different logos that have already been created right and all I just have to do
25:18
is just choose one and then edit it so I just come here and I look for something that uh looks nice and I and I feel like
25:25
okay this might represent my company uh properly for example let's say that I see this one and I like this one uh
25:31
something that you should note it says Pro here so Pro means that it's a paid feature you need to pay to use this logo
25:38
so there are many other ones that are not written Pro if you're using the the free plan avoid the ones that are written Pro and then they won't ask you
25:44
to uh pay anything for example this one here this looks really cool I'm just going to click on that that's what the
25:50
logo will look like uh so as you can see when it's now bigger this is what the logo actually looks like then I just
25:56
click this purple button here which says customize and then it's going to open this area here where you can actually
26:01
just come in and edit everything that you see for example the background is green I'm not a big fan of dark green
26:07
like this so I'll just click on the background right and then this option for the color appears I'll click on that
26:12
and then I get to choose whichever color I like so I personally like um blue I can choose which type of blue I I will
26:19
use I'll probably use the darker one that kind of makes sense to me then now let's say I want to change this kind of
26:25
looks grayish so I'm just going to click on that and then I'm just going to click where it's gray there I'll click on that
26:30
and then I'll look for white can you see it's turned to White and then maybe if I want to change this other part to maybe
26:38
red I'll click on the blue there and then I'll look for the red color see the color has now changed
26:43
there so I get to do anything that I want but in this case I think maybe yellow would work better okay yeah
26:51
yellow looks better now I come here to where it says creative I can just double click on that and then change this to to
27:00
malaba see the name has already changed there then where it says premium letter I do the same thing I double click and
27:06
then I just change this to Media like that and can you see my
27:14
company name has already been done you can just come up here and then just uh make it Bolder like that and then I can
27:22
also maybe change the color I click on the a there and I change the color to white just click out there and
27:29
then I'll come back to here to the malava I'll just click on the malava there and then I'll come back here and
27:34
I'll change the color to yellow and bang just like that got a logo design so can
27:40
you see this didn't even take me five minutes I am already done creating my
27:45
logo and then now if I'm happy with the logo I like the way that it looks if I just want to download this logo I just
27:51
click here where it says share and then I look for where it says
27:56
download I click on download and then I choose what type of format I want to download it in you can get it as a JPEG
28:02
as a PNG PDF um SVG MP4 whatever format I just usually leave it on PNG I click
28:09
on download I give it a second to download and there we go and as you can see right there my logo has been
28:15
designed it's it's completed and like I mentioned you really don't have to overthink this people spend so much time
28:21
trying to design the perfect logo it takes you maybe two weeks or even up to three months trying to find the perfect
28:27
uh name and logo only to discover that after you finally got it you still need to find clients what's most important is
28:33
find clients which I'm going to show you how to do here look at mine mine is just simply text I wrote Mala media and this
28:38
gets me clients I get lots of people who sign up with me for me to build their websites here are some of the people that I I worked with um so yeah don't
28:46
overthink your logo just get it done just get it done and start running your business okay so in this video let's
Setting up your own website
28:52
talk about you setting up your own personal website using Creator HQ it
28:58
makes sense that if you're going to be promoting cre HQ and building websites for people you need to have your own website that people can see they can see
29:06
your your services what exactly you you have on offer to your potential clients
29:11
number two they can also see like the type of work that you have done on your own personal website and the different
29:16
clients that you have worked with for example this is my current website I may change it as time goes on but this
29:23
website has done a lot of uh great things for me as simple as it is my website is mainly focused on text my
29:31
copy here is mainly targeting my target audience which are people who don't want to focus on the tech but they sell
29:37
digital products so you notice that there's a lot of text on my uh website and the text is just telling people to
29:43
book a free call with me why because I wanted people to get on to calls with me and then I close them as clients we have
29:50
conversations we talk about their goals what they want to achieve with their website and then we see whether I'm a
29:55
good person I'm I'm I'm the right fit to help them achieve those goals and then somewhere along the line there there's
30:01
also like some images that I put that link to different websites that I've set for uh different clients now as time has
30:07
gone on I've got more clients I just haven't updated the website but I've managed to generate over
30:12
$440,000 using this simple website so it's not about having a complicated
30:18
website it's about having a website that functions and shows someone who when they come to your website they feel like
30:25
okay I think I can work with Marshall and then there's always a call to action for them to maybe book a call with you
30:31
or to just buy your services there's also another section here where I put some testimonials and then just a bit
30:37
about me at the bottom so when it comes to your website firstly you need to be clear on okay what services do you want
30:44
to offer what do you want to be known for right I'm targeting people who want to sell digital products but maybe you
30:51
want to work with uh any type of business that may need a website so based on that that's how you're going to
30:57
set up your website and a good way for you to get an indicator of what details you should be putting on your website
31:02
like do you need menu options at the top is just to Simply see what your competition is doing if you just go to
31:08
Google and just search for web design agency web design companies if you say near me Google will show you different
31:15
uh websites but it will show you local websites and it will also show you some websites that are available
31:21
internationally so what I just did is that I just went here and I just searched for web design agencies near me
31:27
and this is just something that came up I'm not affiliated with this website or anything it's just an example like I can
31:33
come here and see what are these guys offering and then I can get some ideas of what I should also include on my
31:39
website personally I don't like this website because it's just full of too much um text especially in this area
31:45
here it might be too much for someone who wants a specific result they just know that they need a web designer so
31:51
now they have to read through all this information uh it's it's it looks a bit complicated for me so that's my
31:58
preference here's another example here this one I like it better because it's got more images it's got large text and
32:04
it's very simple and straight to the point so you'll see that there are different types of websites that you
32:09
will find but people are all focusing on selling Web Design Services so get ideas
32:15
of different websites that you think okay this is cool this I like this and I want to take these ideas but remember
32:21
there must be a goal of people either having a conversation with you and then
32:26
you then are able to sell them your servic or you just simply show them your prices that people are able to buy and then you
32:32
are able to start selling to them here's just one more example here for another website so basically I'm just showing
32:38
you these examples to show you that okay there other people are already doing this so you don't have to make up the
32:43
rules you don't have to make it up to that okay uh let me invent what I should have on my website there are people who
32:48
are already doing this another thing that can also help you is just in create HQ there are templates that you're going to be working with if you just go to the
32:55
main website and just click here it says templates you'll see all these different templates that you can just choose from
33:01
I'm going to suggest that um you come here and click where it says Consulting if you click on Consulting it will show you the websites that are mainly used
33:07
for Consultants or agencies like this one awesome website design if I click on
33:13
that this is a web this is a this is a template that's used by web
33:19
designers to build their web design business so as you can see here this is just a nice picture here there's going
33:24
to be your logo here you can choose to use this so rather than trying to figure out okay what should I include in my
33:30
website you just simply use this and then you're just going to change the text and just fill it up with your
33:35
details so that will make it simpler and easier for you so don't try and reinvent
33:41
the wheel don't try and like be stuck trying to figure out okay what what 50
33:46
million words should I put on my website try and make it as simple as possible like I showed you mine mine is simple
33:52
mine is super straight to the point when someone comes and reads this they know that this is specific for them last
33:59
thing that I also then want to mention is that of course like when you are inside your inside your software there
34:05
this option here which says Academy if you click on Academy it's going to give you tutorials and trainings on how to
34:11
set up all these different things make sure that you go through the website section and clearly understand it and
34:16
use it to build your own website uh before you start trying to build websites for other clients there's also
34:23
going to be another video after this after this video there's going to be a lesson on how to set up we we sites for
34:28
your potential clients you might also want to check that out after you check out of course this course here it will
34:34
just give you a bit more clarity and a bit more understanding of how you need to set up your own website but just
34:40
don't take too much time doing this like I mentioned my website I've generated over 40 nearly $50,000 by using a
34:47
simply designed website like this it doesn't have to be complicated this works for me as long as it's helping
34:54
clients to gain Clarity that okay we can work with Marshall and that's what they're looking for make it nice simple
35:00
and easy and just get started uh finding your dream clients all right let's talk about the steps that you need to follow
Building a clients website
35:07
in order for you to build a website for a client let's say that a client says to you that I need you to build me a
35:13
website what exactly are you going to be doing for them so what I've done is that um I've just attached if you look below
35:21
this video you're going to see like a checklist you can download it and you can use it so this is a basic list of
35:26
things that you need to to get from each client so that you then will be able to build the website so I just want to go
35:32
through it quickly then I actually show you how I would then build the website the first thing that you need from them
35:37
is the name of the business what is the name of the business let's say I'm the client the name of the business is going to be malaba media so you need them to
35:45
just give you that information and then what does your business do or what do you want your website to do so I can if
35:52
it's me I'll tell you that my my business is a digital marketing company and we help people to build websites
35:58
so by knowing what they I want their business to do it will tell me what type of business sorry what type of website
36:04
to actually build and so the examples of different websites is maybe there's someone who just needs a landing page
36:09
type of website where it only has got information about one thing and I'll show you the example of mine uh it's
36:16
just created to get one specific result someone to click a button and sign up for something or for someone to totally
36:23
leave or another example of a website might be an e-commerce store where people can go online and buy maybe some
36:28
products like makeup or some clothing or whatever so you need to be clear what type of website you're going to be
36:34
building for them this also helps you in terms of your pricing and we'll talk about that later the third thing is
36:39
domain you want to register right this basically means what's they address my
36:44
address is is malaba media.org right or you can search for.com and you able to
36:50
find it how do they want people to find them online some people would just be their personal name but most businesses
36:55
it would be the business name then the next thing is colors and branding what colors do they want to appear on their
37:01
website my favorite colors are normally blue white and red so that's my type of branding or most of the different stuff
37:07
you see me posting online you need to be clear what exactly they need and then there's logo uh do they already have a
37:15
logo or if they don't have a logo if they don't have a logo it might create an opportunity for you to actually charge them more as you create a logo
37:22
for them and I'm going to show you one of the videos how you can actually create logos for yourself and for
37:28
clients right and then a favon favicon basically is simply this here that you see by the corner of a website like if
37:35
you notice here at the top here where it says website this image that you're seeing here is a favicon also here this
37:42
is the favicon this is what kind of like differentiates websites especially when you've got a lot of tabs open you'll be
37:48
able to see that that's created um that's created HQ because of the Big C so that's what's called a fabricon and
37:55
then the next thing is what menu options do they need to appear on their website like myself I I don't have any menu menu
38:02
options on my website because I I don't offer anything else I just want them to be able to book a call if it doesn't
38:08
make if them getting to my website doesn't make sense to them they're going to close it means that I'm not um their
38:13
ideal customer but basically most websites have got like a home they've got about they've got pricing they've
38:18
got contact us they've got a blog like when you check up here on Creator HQ this is basically how most
38:25
websites operate there's the home there's features Tempest this PL is pricing so the client needs to tell you what options they want to be created on
38:33
their website because all these different menu options are different pages if someone clicks on one of them
38:38
they go to a different page and they're able to find more information about that business then another great thing to ask
38:44
them for is examples of websites that they've seen that they want their website to look like like most times
38:51
clients will come to you and say that I need a website right so that you can be clear on kind of what they have in their
38:57
mind just ask them for examples of other websites that maybe they have seen if they totally don't have any examples
39:03
based on the questions that you've already asked them like okay what type of business are you running or what do you want your business to do you might
39:10
just go and look for examples of other websites yourself and then show the client okay okay would you be interested
39:15
in this your website looking like this that way it saves you a lot of trouble because some people will tell that they need a website and then you take like
39:22
maybe let's say two weeks or three weeks to build this amazing website and but because it's amazing to you you are a
39:29
web designer you've been doing this for a couple of years it's amazing to you but to them it might not be what they
39:34
want because they have a picture in their mind so the best thing to do is ask them for those examples so that it's
39:39
just going to save you a lot of trouble um it's going to save you a time and then you don't get into trouble then do
39:45
you already have the copy you want to appear on your website copy basically means uh the information that will be
39:52
written like if I show you my website all this information that's written on my website
39:57
it's not just random information this is information that when the type of person I want to work with as a client when
40:04
they read this they will be convinced that Marshall is the right person to work with and then they will what will
40:09
they do they'll come here and they'll click on this and book a call uh with me so if someone is interested in building
40:15
an online store if they come to my website they are not going to reach out to me based on this information uh here
40:21
if they're just trying to build like maybe a a random online store but for someone who is a course creator someone
40:27
who who's trying to sell digital products online when they read this they will see that okay I'm the best person
40:32
to help them based on the information that I wrote and that's what we call Copy Copy is basically when someone uses
40:39
words to convince someone to take an action and there actually going to be a whole module or whole chapter about that
40:45
where I'm going to be teaching you how you actually can get uh the copy created for you and then what you can do is that
40:50
you can either offer it as a as a free option for your customers or you can actually sell it to them and we'll talk
40:56
about that later then the next thing is the list of services you want to know okay first of all what's your website
41:02
about or are you trying to sell something or or or what if they say yes they're trying to sell something they need to provide you the list of services
41:08
that they're actually trying to sell and then the last thing is images you want to be used on your website like uh you
41:15
notice on my website I don't have much images especially at the top I I
41:20
designed it that way but then I then put like maybe the images of the different websites that I actually set up but
41:26
there are some websites where they will want images to be portrayed on the website even Creator HQ itself as you
41:33
can see right here on on the front page they are actually images so you need them to tell you okay do you have images
41:39
that you want me to use or do you have an idea of the type of images you would want me to look for and in that case if
41:45
they want you to find the images there are lots of free websites that you can actually go to and uh look for and just
41:52
in case I don't talk about this in the other videos there's for example on pexels.com this is a cool place where you can actually find uh free images
41:59
just simply search here for the type of image that you're looking for and then you can download it and use it for free so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
42:04
put this checklist below this video so that you can just download it I might just add a few more things just in case
42:10
I forgot something whilst recording this video but now how exactly would I then build the website so the reason why we
42:16
use Creator HQ is because if you just come to the homepage here and click where it says templates you will see all
42:22
the different types of templates that you can use to build websites as you can see right here to the left these are the
42:28
different types of businesses um that usually use the templates that are available right and
42:34
then here there's online store and then there's landing pages and then there is funnels I'll talk about all these later
42:40
on but let's say like maybe I want to start a consulting company or my client is doing consulting I just simply click
42:46
there on Consulting and then it will show me the different templates that are there and then all I I just need to do
42:52
is just choose which template I like let's say maybe I like this one here I just simply click on where it says uh
42:58
view I can view the template and see if I like it if it's exactly what I want to work with and if I like it then I'm just
43:04
going to click where it says start with this theme and another thing that you can also do just by using these templates is it it will enable you to
43:11
let's say maybe do quick previews for your clients right for example I can just like use this right quickly change
43:17
the name to my client's name and maybe just change the details here a bit and then I just click on start right and
43:24
then the whole website is going to be built then I can just send the client a link and say that okay this is what your
43:29
website is going to look like when it's done right and you don't necessarily have to go in and complete everything
43:35
you're just trying to show them early on and then they choose whether they like it or not then based on the information
43:40
they give you you just proceed using that theme and actually that's one of the ways to actually convince people to work with you because you're able to
43:47
generate an example of a website for them without necessarily having to build the whole website taking all your time
43:53
and effort you can just generate an example show them and then hey if they love it they then pay you the money and
43:58
then you release the website to them but now when it actually comes to building the website what you will then do is that once the person you have signed up
44:05
or the person has signed up you're just going to start off by seeing these different templates and you're just
44:11
going to choose one of them and I'm just going to choose one of these randomly like this one that I see here it says
44:16
dentist but that's the one that I want to use I'm just going to select that and then I'm just going to type in and say
44:24
um demo for the post right let's say that's the name of
44:30
my website obviously you're going to name it whatever then I'm going to click on submit then as usual this popup is
44:35
going to appear here which which will just give you a basic walk through of how to actually um use the the page
44:43
builder but you can watch that yourself but I'm not going to talk about it now so this is what the website looks like
44:50
right so everything in here has already been set up for you so what you then
44:55
need first is like from the checklist that we had one of the things that we had was the logo right so for logo you
45:02
can come and just click there you see this option appears here for the wheel you can just click on that and then you
45:08
choose what type of logo you want to use if it's an image logo you're going to click on image and then you're going to
45:13
locate the logo on your desktop right you click on upload here and then it's
45:18
going to show you your desktop you can locate it and then upload it to um this
45:23
section once you've done that you save it and then it's going to up here right there but I'm just going to go for the
45:29
one which is text and then I'm just going to change this and just call it
45:35
demo like I said see how easy that is already I've changed the logo at the top there and then if I want to change the
45:42
text here remember what I said it's about having the copy you want to know what exactly do they want to appear on
45:47
their website so in this case I'm just using this example of of mine but I can if this is the copy that the client said
45:53
that they want to have I'll just copy the copy I'll come back here I'm just going to
46:00
double click there I'm going to highlight all the text there and I'm just going to paste can you see just
46:06
like that I've already put the content in there and then I can come and get
46:13
this next line of text here and then I just copy that I'm using
46:19
contrl C or command C if you're on Mac and then I highlight that that's
46:26
command a or uh contrl a and then I just
46:31
paste contrl v as you can see all the text has now been pasted in there but as you can see obviously the blue is kind
46:37
of being faded out by this dark element at the back so what I'll do is that I will just change this top
46:45
part to something like uh I will maybe use
46:52
yellow and then for this bottom part I will use
46:57
um white again just going to use white then can
47:05
you see this is like aligned to the left so I'm just going to click here and align it to the center and then I'm
47:11
going to increase the spacing of the text by clicking there and I can click
47:17
on maybe put it one point4 so that it's not congested and then I'm going to
47:24
change the font size to maybe 18 so that it looks better like that
47:30
then there's a bit of space here I'm just going to delete that space like that can you see so hey I
47:37
already have got my website copy written there if I want to change the font size if it's too
47:44
big I can still do that I showed you right now how to do it so that's basically what I'm just going to be doing I'm just going to be copying my
47:51
text and filling it in in all these different sections right if I don't want this
47:58
section here all I just have to do like if I don't want this whole block I come here where it says block I see where it
48:03
says delete I click on delete it's been deleted if I want to
48:09
add an element um I just click here by the plus that's for widgets and I then
48:16
choose what type of element I want to add in which
48:23
section so let's say maybe I want to add um a store so that people will be able to buy
48:31
something right I just drag it to the section where I want it to be and I drop
48:36
like that can you see and there's store this is these are the different
48:42
things that maybe I'm I'm selling I then can go in and
48:47
change right now it's not making sense because it's yoga this is something that's already pre-built it's like a template that's in there but you can
48:53
change all this so it's that easy and simple to build a website make sure that
49:00
you have got examples of websites that your client wants there to look like
49:05
like if I want to use this as an example it means I'm going to be removing all the images I'm just going to be working
49:10
with white background or should just say solid backgrounds and a lot of text
49:16
right then here there's a section for like these are the different types of websites that are built all you just do
49:23
to to recreate this is by if it's not there there
49:29
already if it's not there already what you can do is you just come here to the
49:34
widgets and you look for something that has to do with um okay first thing what we'll do is that we'll take a
49:41
container and put it somewhere like can you see it stretches from the left to the right it's that red line there we
49:47
drop it there and then we choose how many columns we want this to have I'm just going to click there in
49:54
the center then it will appear saying one column I click on that and I'll change it to three columns can you see
50:00
those lines one two three and then what I can then do is I come back here to the widgets I take the image and I drag it
50:07
there and I paste the image now it's asking you okay which image do you want to use let me just do this quickly for
50:13
you this is just for example purposes I'm going to download this image from my website uh fast onto my desktop okay
50:21
it's been downloaded I'm going to come back here and then I'm going to say
50:27
uh locate right I'm going to upload the
50:33
file okay I click on my downloads and there it is that's the first image there
50:39
then I click on open and there's the image and then I
50:44
just need to make sure that I select on the image and then I click on select and as you can see it's appeared there in
50:50
the background just going to click out there and then click on Save right so do you see how simple and easy it is to do
50:56
that so already I have this image and then I can have the other ones here when I'm
51:03
now happy that it's actually equal I then can go on and proceed with editing everything else on the website and so so
51:10
that this video is not too long and I and I don't waste time actually showing you how to do everything step by step
51:16
because it's going to take obviously a bit of a while that's basically how you're going to be editing everything on
51:21
the site and then if you want to maybe move on to the next page and edit the next thing just click on save first and
51:27
then where it says about us you can just click on that and then it's going to open the about us page and then you can
51:32
come in here and then you can edit everything that you are seeing so it's that simple and easy to build a website
51:40
there's nothing that in this um tool or this platform that cannot be edited um
51:46
like I mentioned I don't want this video to be too long if you need more instructions about that watch the first video that appears that shows you
51:52
basically how to use um the the page builder but also you can come here to
51:57
the academy right and watch the videos on how to create a website that you will
52:02
find in the academy it's going to explain to you everything that you need to know but once you are done this and
52:09
you are happy with how your page is actually looking the next thing that you then need to do is just click here on the settings right and then this is
52:16
where you're going to add the favicon the favon like I showed you is this small image that you add at the top right here um you're going to add it
52:24
here and it gives you instructions of like the dimension it usually has to be in the Square format and then there's what's called a social sharing image in
52:31
other words when you share the link of the website with someone the image that will appear here so usually it can be
52:37
like um the form usually it can be a nice image that portrays what is on the
52:43
homepage or it might just be the logo you just also need to upload it to this section here in case you want to do some
52:49
custom code this is a section that you're going to be putting some custom code uh for example when we were talking
52:54
about Google analytics when we're talking about adding maybe something different to the website that does not
53:01
uh happen naturally through the page builder you'll be able to do all of it uh here but I'm not going to get into it
53:07
in this video for page SEO search SEO basically means search engine optimization so that uh Google will be
53:14
able to rank the website and make it to be found more easier this is where you're going to do it you're going to
53:19
put like the title and then you're going to put the meta description and I'm going to be talking about this later on
53:24
and then the share image just like I shown you earlier on this is where you're also going to put it file manager is basically all the images that you're
53:31
going to be uploading to the website you'll be able to find them in this section and then over here where it says
53:37
domains this is where you're going to add the domain that they have chosen to use in my case it was malaba media but
53:45
for them you then need to buy the domain first if they haven't bought it already and um then you're going to add it here
53:52
so the steps are very simple and easy to follow you just click here it says Connect an existing domain and then
53:58
you're going to type the name of the domain here like let me just say it's um like let's say that my the name of my
54:03
website is this is just a tutorial.com I'm going to click on connect domain and then it wants to verify the
54:10
domain so what you need to do is go to your domain provider and add these details and I'll show you how to do that
54:16
later on it's as simple and as easy as that and then in about um 2 hours but
54:21
usually takes less than that two hours the the worst case scenario is that it would take maybe 24 hours the worst worst case scenario is that will take
54:28
maybe about 48 Hours it always differs because of different locations and different servers that are being uh used
54:34
but normally takes less than two hours then you'll be able to search for that domain name like malava media and the
54:42
website will appear so that's what this whole process is all about then of course if you want to add like the language and time you can do it from
54:48
here cookies and privacy uh applications personalization and URL redirects
54:55
personalization just simply refers to you actually can add here so that their phone number when you add the phone
55:00
number here on every other page where you want the phone number to appear it will automatically appear same as
55:06
location right and then system properties for example like maybe or there are some sections on your website
55:11
where you can make their name appear like I don't know if you noticed like when I came into the Builder for the
55:17
first time it said High Marshall right so every time it writes High Marshall it's because of these settings that are
55:23
here so yeah basically that's how you'll be able to build a website but if you have got any other questions just make
55:29
sure that you reach out in the group or in the WhatsApp chat and I'll do my best to answer all the questions that you
55:35
have but guys it's that simple it's that easy you can build a website in minutes like I've just shown you in this video I
Website content
55:42
want to talk briefly about website content website content simply refers to
55:48
what are you supposed to write on uh website what exactly is going to appear
55:53
on uh the website that you're building just to give you different examples of websites like this is an online store
56:01
right um just some online store that I just found just by simply searching you see right there there's like a big
56:07
banner and uh whatever they're promoting there I'm not really concerned with what they're promoting I'm just trying to
56:12
show you that this is what an online store looks like as you can see it's mainly focused on images it's focused on
56:18
these big banners here and then as you scroll down each different image has got different prices and they're just
56:24
promoting whatever they currently have on promotion if I go to another online
56:30
store um this is another one this one has got a bit more text but as you can see it's just basically got images of
56:37
whatever it is that they're promoting it's got a menu here to the left that you can click on to find out uh whatever
56:44
you are specifically looking for so this this is what online stores look like but
56:49
then if I maybe go to a different type of website this one is just something
56:54
for chiropractice or someone if you don't know the chiropr is just basically another type of doctor that mainly
57:01
focuses on the on the back you notice that this one has got it's not it's not
57:07
as promotional as the other but there's more text there's more detail at the background there there's images of
57:13
someone exercising their back there it's got the hours of work it's got basically information about what they do then
57:19
there are some images of the different doctors there and if I come here and here's another business
57:24
coach um website and you notice this one is set up as a Blog so it's just a whole lot of
57:31
text and then there's just a big image there so basically what I'm trying to show you here is that websites are
57:37
different you're not going to find one website that is the same as another if you're building an online store for one
57:43
business it's not going to be the same as uh as a Blog website for another
57:48
client so you need to be aware of that there are different types of websites and you need to be aware that um the
57:54
information that you need to put on the website is always different for each particular client so where exactly do
58:01
you get the information that you put on the website normally they will give you an outline of what they want to be
58:07
written on the website that's normally the best case scenario it means that you're going to finish your job even
58:13
quicker because they give you all the content so actually in part of your onboarding process you need to mention
58:18
to them that you need information about what they want uh in their website and a
58:24
good practice is to ask that based on the different menu options that they will ask for for example what do they
58:31
want on the homepage what do they want written on the about us page what they want written on the contact us page some
58:38
people you realize that they don't know what information to put there so it's always a good idea for them to also look
58:44
at their competition and see what their competitors have already put on their website then it will give them an
58:49
outline or a structure of what they should have on their own websites so if
58:55
you don't if they don't have the copy they don't have and yes copy is another word for Content it's the it's the word
59:01
that we use in this marketing field for building websites and stuff we call it uh copy right so if they don't have copy
59:09
first of all start off by looking at what they're selling what exactly are you selling so I showed you those examples there the online stores were
59:15
different from the other types of websites if it's an online store you are mainly focused on images of what they're
59:20
selling and then the price and then people can just simply click and add to cut and then when they're done they just
59:26
uh put together all the products that they want to buy at one time and then they buy so it depends on what exactly
59:31
they're selling if it's if if they're selling information then you definitely need like maybe more text content like
59:37
it's going to be like a Blog format then I already spoke about this you can look at their competition their competition
59:43
will give you a picture of what type of website they should have themselves because we work by this principle that
59:49
you don't want to reinvent the wheel you simply do what others are doing successfully and it will also work out
59:54
for you right okay then the third one is by using AI tools actually there's
1:00:00
another fourth one here that I should mention here it's by doing copy copy writing copywriting is a skill
1:00:08
that you can learn and develop and you can actually charge a lot of money for this you can offer it as a service based
1:00:14
on the fact that you've maybe gone ahead and studied it and learned it you can offer to do copyrighting for people
1:00:21
based on what you have learned doing copywriting but another aspect of it is using AI tools do the copywriting for
1:00:27
your for you if you're doing copywriting it means that you've studied it you've learned it and then you are the one
1:00:32
who's going to write the copy but if you're using AI tools you'll be able to use online software that will write the
1:00:38
content and the copy for you and just to give you examples of different ones that you can actually get uh if you notice
1:00:45
below this video you're going to see another video here that will show you some different AI tools that you can try
1:00:51
and look up and just experiment and see whether they are what you want to work with um they just some some three tools
1:00:57
that I've attached below there's a great video that I found on YouTube and I just attached it here so that you can just go
1:01:02
through it and find something that works for you but the ones that I recommend the most that I've had experience working with uh the first one here is
1:01:09
called copy. a obviously it's not a free tool but um it's got a free plan to a
1:01:14
certain extent but basically what it's going to do that it's going to write a lot of copy for you mainly it's focused
1:01:19
for people for who want to write blog posts or long form content but basically yes it will write all the copy for you
1:01:26
what you do is you just get in there you tell it what to do then it will write a copy for you you just copy the content
1:01:31
and then paste on the client's website another great one to use is this one which is called Jasper
1:01:37
AI um it does the same thing as copy AI but I think Jasper has been there for
1:01:42
longer than the other one and um basically they do the same thing but why I like copy AI better is because the
1:01:49
pricing blind is slightly cheaper so you can just come to this website Google them and then you just check the pricing
1:01:55
plan on yourself I don't want to go into too depth about that because I'm not trying to promote those platforms I'm
1:02:00
just giving you options here the other one that's available is called chat GPT this is currently at the moment one of
1:02:06
the most popular things people are talking about online basically it's a tool that you just come here and you type in props and say for example write
1:02:12
a blog post about a chiropractor and then it's going to write that blog post for you but then it's it's AI is still
1:02:20
under development it will make some mistakes sometimes you need to go in there and you need to correct it and I'm
1:02:25
currently on a free plan yes they have got a paid plan as you can see here upgrade to plus gives you better features it gives you better reliability
1:02:32
you can choose to use it if you want and then the last one is called right cream
1:02:37
it does similar to the other ones but then it also involves um AI in fact all of them involve Ai and they're all
1:02:44
developing and growing but it's a great tool that you can use um to create here they also showing you the different
1:02:50
types of content that you can write using this tool you just come in here it's going to create the content for for
1:02:56
you and obviously you're going to have to pay for it there's a if you click on pricing some way there it's going to
1:03:01
show you the different prices that you can sign up I think it's one of the cheapest out of all of them but it's a
1:03:06
great tool that you can choose to use so just to summarize everything that I spoke about you need to create content
1:03:12
or copy for your clients you get that information from them if they don't
1:03:17
already know what they want uh to be written on their websites then you are going to have to either use these AI
1:03:23
tools you're going to have to either use um copy your copyrighting skills as if you have actually started as a
1:03:29
copywriter or in fact you can actually hire a copywriter to do it if you don't have the time to do it yourself or you
1:03:34
just copy from their competitors but obviously there's PL arism you're not going to copy exactly what the
1:03:39
competitors write you're just looking for structure and guidance on what should be appearing on the website so if
1:03:45
you do that then it makes your job easier in terms of building your website and knowing exactly what to put on
1:03:52
it now let's talk about payment gateways payment gateways are basically what you're going to be using to receive
1:03:59
payments from your clients so if you click here where it says store it will then bring you to this section here
1:04:05
where you then can set up your payment gateways so you just click here where it says connect as you can see connected
1:04:11
payment processor you click on where it says connect and then you then can set
1:04:16
up by just simply clicking where it says add a payment provider just click on that and then it's going to show you all
1:04:22
the different payment providers that are available for you to be able to connect to um this platform so the most common
1:04:30
one that most people use around the world is called stripe so depending on where you are around the world stripe is
1:04:35
the most uh used payment Gateway or payment Pro payment processor that's actually out there but because I'm in
1:04:42
South Africa and most parts of of Africa as a whole stripe is very limited but if
1:04:47
you do want to go and register for stripe this is what the website looks like you just go to stripe.com just come
1:04:52
here to stripe and then register create an account and then you'll be able to then connect it to the platform and
1:04:59
what's nice about this is that you just simply click on connect and then it's going to want to
1:05:05
identify um your stripe account in other words if you've already created a stripe account it will automatically detect
1:05:11
that you have got a stripe account for example as you can see this is one of my stripe accounts uh here that's why it's already identifying that and then I just
1:05:18
simply click here on connect and then it's automatically done there's nothing that I have to do I just need to make
1:05:23
sure that I go to my stripe account I log in on the same browser that I'm trying to do this on and then click on
1:05:30
that button and then it's going to do everything for me automatically but now because most of the people probably
1:05:35
signing up for this course maybe you're based in Africa like myself the next best alternative to strike is what's
1:05:40
called P de PCH is another platform once again where you can just go and sign up as you can see there they've got a free
1:05:46
account that you can sign up for you create your account and then you'll be able to connect it inside um here you
1:05:53
just scroll down to here where it says um connect past you click on connect and then you're just going to follow the
1:05:58
instructions as you can see they're going to ask you for a public key and the secret key you just get those details and then you paste them in here
1:06:05
and then your account will then start working receiving payments through paste a and maybe something just to note once
1:06:11
you add your public key and your secret key normally You' look for an option that says save just trying to save your
1:06:16
settings but this this actually just saves your settings automatically so you don't have to do anything afterwards
1:06:23
another payment Gateway that we normally use especially in South Africa is this one which is called pay fast you can
1:06:29
just simply click on connect there again it's going to ask you for mention ID your mention key and then your pass
1:06:34
phrase so pay fast is also free to sign up and join so the way all these three maybe I should have just mentioned them
1:06:40
they're all free to join but then they take a certain percentage of the money that you transact through them so
1:06:46
they're basically free you're not going to be paying anything so you can sign up for payal it's free to join and then you're going to add the details here and
1:06:52
then the last option obviously is Paypal which is another very popular one um aside from stripe so you just simply
1:06:59
come to PayPal and create an account and the once you've got the details there you then can come here and enter the
1:07:06
details you click on add another and then you look for the PayPal option and as you can see for PayPal is super
1:07:12
simple you just add your PayPal email address here and then there's nothing else that you have to do automatically
1:07:17
you'll be able to receive payments to your PayPal something that I do have to mention is that because you are running a business here it makes sense for you
1:07:23
to register as a business account so so all these platforms allow you to register with a personal account but the
1:07:28
more money that you make they will actually require you to upgrade to a business account so you might as well just try and uh get set up as a business
1:07:36
account as soon as possible so when it comes to registering business accounts you've got uh you've got a couple of
1:07:42
options the first option is that you can go to your local registry and sign up or
1:07:47
register your business if you know that um for myself what I did in South Africa
1:07:52
is that there's this company that I use it's called golf chain you just reach out to them and they help you to
1:07:57
register your company they will do everything for you they will help you to get um all the papers sorted out they'll
1:08:03
actually even help you to like get a bank account for your business but of course they're going to be charging you a fee as you can see here they're
1:08:09
charging a fee of 880 Rands um once off and I like this because uh I know when
1:08:15
it comes to registering businesses there's a lot of things that need to be done they take care of everything it just takes them about a week and they
1:08:21
send you all the details that you need to know so this is what works in South Africa but you don't be limited to
1:08:26
saying that okay this only applies in South Africa your your area wherever you are around the world you actually can
1:08:32
find someone or some business that can help you to register the company as quick as possible all right so those are the main details that you need to know
1:08:39
about setting up your payment gateways your payment processes but just before I end the video I just wanted to just
1:08:44
throw in some quick advice um when I started my business I didn't have a registered company I was just working as
1:08:50
an individual CU I didn't yet have the money to actually register my company I was working as an IND individual and I
1:08:56
was reaching out to clients I was helping them to solve their problems then I got some money from the clients
1:09:02
which then enabled me to be able to register my company so don't limit yourself and say that no okay I won't
1:09:07
continue or I won't move on to the next step until maybe I find the money to register company just in case you are
1:09:13
that person who is at this stage right now you can actually go ahead set up your website set up everything else and
1:09:18
then once you are done you then come back to this option where you set up the payment processes you can actually reach
1:09:23
out to your potential clients and then tell them that okay if they want to make a payment maybe you give them direct
1:09:28
links to your bank account so that they paid directly into your bank account and not necessarily pay through the website
1:09:35
paying through the website makes the process simpler and easy but it shouldn't stop you from starting it just makes the process more perfect but don't
1:09:43
fail to start because you don't yet have your business registered I just wanted to say that quickly okay so in this
1:09:48
video we're going to be focusing on buying a domain and then setting it up these are two things that you would need
1:09:53
to do uh for yourself you need to get your own business domain that's if you don't already have a domain a domain
1:09:59
simply means the name that people are going to be using to find you for example if you go on to Google and type
1:10:05
in Marshall mav.com you will find my website right or my business whatever so
1:10:10
the your business needs to have its own domain whether it's at com at COA or whatever and just before I show you how
1:10:17
to do that just a few things that you need to take note of uh firstly you need to do this for yourself and then when
1:10:22
you're doing it for your clients um you need to do this process for them sometimes but then also sometimes they
1:10:28
already have their domain so you just need to know how to con connect their domain to uh the Creator HQ software so
1:10:36
regardless of whether they use the the tool I'm going to show you right now or they use um go daddy or blue host or
1:10:42
whatever platform they use for hosting the process is the same you'll be able to get the same details on those
1:10:48
different platforms and then you'll be able to put it in create HQ so you will notice right now in the video that you got about to watch uh I'm going be
1:10:55
talking about a different video or a different training that I already did uh for some other students uh in another
1:11:02
course so the process is still the same you notice that I'm talking about something different like Marshall malaba
1:11:08
live.com but the process is still the same because I'll setting up a website for one of my other businesses but just
1:11:14
follow the same process for whatever website you're setting up for your clients and it's going to work now in
1:11:19
order for you to buy a domain I'm going to put a link below this video you can click on it and it's going to bring you to a site that looks something like this
1:11:28
um it's called name Chap and so this is where you're going to be able to buy your domain and so because for most of
1:11:34
you watching this it probably will be your first time what I recommend is that you think in terms of branding look at
1:11:40
using your own name for example the same way that I use Marshall
1:11:54
mala.mia okay this is someone that I know and then like I can actually trust and they'll be more willing to actually
1:12:01
engage in your website so what you just come here and do is just simply type in and say Marshall malaba this is going to
1:12:08
be your name and then you can click on search now because my name I've already used it before I'm just going to add on
1:12:14
and say maybe Tech or I can say live or I can say Marshall the entrepreneur it's
1:12:19
really up to you what you want to do but you're going to be using your name so I'm just going to Simply type that in and then I'm going to click on
1:12:26
search and the reason why we're using name chip there are many other platforms that are there but the reason why we're
1:12:32
using name chip is because name chip is one of the most affordable on the internet they will give you a great
1:12:38
great price so that's why you need to use this link um in the description below and secondly in terms of support
1:12:44
they actually have got a good support whenever you have any challenges they can walk you through what you need to do
1:12:49
so as you can see Marshall Marshall Mala tech.com is available for $8.98 cents
1:12:55
and then all to get it I just have to click on add to cut before I do that I just want to show you here if you just
1:13:01
scroll down it will show you other results that are available ma tech. XYZ
1:13:07
that's another end prefix there it's available for $2 here's another one for $4.98 and that's me here's another
1:13:15
oneart for $4.98 so you can get any one of these other ones they are very much cheaper
1:13:22
but the reason why I would recommend that you go for is because is the most uh used especially internationally
1:13:29
people recognize more than all these other ones and yet they all do the same thing but it's really up to you to
1:13:35
choose whichever one you want I'm just going to go forom once you're happy with it you just
1:13:40
click here it says add to cart by the way it has to tick here like if it gives you a tick it that's when it means that
1:13:47
it's available if it's an X it means it's not available you might just need to change your name but anyway if you're happy and you've added to cart you just
1:13:52
click here where it says check out on the checkout page sometimes they can offer you a whole lot of different things like some of these things may be
1:13:58
ticked like they'll offer you a VPN and they'll offer you SSL certificate and all those things you don't need them um
1:14:06
they will just be offering them to you because it's a way that they will generate more money yes they're important but you don't need them so
1:14:13
just make sure it's the exact same price that you want that you ordered it's $8.98 plus they're giving you an I can
1:14:18
fee it comes to $96 you just click here it says confirm order and then the next page is going to ask you to log into
1:14:24
your account or to create an account now because most people are coming to this page for the first time you're going to just click here where it says uh create
1:14:30
an account you're going to create a username my username I just use my initial M and then my surname malaba you
1:14:37
can do the same thing for yourself or you can use your full name um it's fine just don't add any spaces and then you
1:14:43
create a password you add your first name your last name and then your email address and then this tick option here
1:14:48
is for you to receive their marketing information via a newsletter or marketing communication so when you're
1:14:54
happy or you're done just click on create account and continue but because I already have got an account I'm just
1:15:00
going to log in quickly and then show you the next uh page what happens then on the next page it's going to look like
1:15:05
something like this and then it's going to ask you to enter your credit card details and your address I'm not going
1:15:11
to scroll down because some of my sensitive information is down there at the moment but you're just going to
1:15:17
enter your details there and then you're just going to click on pay now and then automatically they'll create an account
1:15:23
for you and then you have access to your domain and once you registered it's then
1:15:30
going to bring you to this page right here and as you can see here it's going to list down the domains that you
1:15:36
actually have or you can just click here where it says domain list and then it's going to show you all the domain the
1:15:43
domains that you actually uh own so once again this is just a reminder that this is a training that I did for another
1:15:50
business but then it the process is still the same so when I talk about
1:15:55
setting up your website this is what your website should look like when you are inside of Creator HQ when you log in
1:16:01
regardless of which page you working on as long as you are under the Builder you'll be able to get to these settings
1:16:07
you just want to click on settings um to your left on the menu there that round
1:16:12
wheel there click on it and then you'll be able to find the settings that I'm about to show you now the next thing that we need to do is to connect a
1:16:19
domain so that when people um use our domain name they will be able to find
1:16:24
our website so in order for us to do that we're just going to Simply come here to the settings make sure that
1:16:30
you're on this first uh funnel first and then you're going to click on funnel
1:16:35
settings and then when this pops up click on domains and then you're going to click
1:16:42
this red button which says connect an existing domain and then you're going to type in the domain that you want to use
1:16:49
so for me it's going to be Marshall malabal life.com just like that and then
1:16:54
I'm just going to click on connect then this next page is going to pop up and it's going to ask you to please log into
1:17:00
your domain provider and correct the DNS entries in other words it wants you to enter these details um right here in the
1:17:08
DNS entries so all you have to do is go back to name chip where you bought your
1:17:13
domain so you're just going to enter name chip click on where it says domain
1:17:19
list and then choose your domain and then come and click where it
1:17:24
says manage make sure it's the correct domain Marshall malava live for you it's going to be whatever your domain name is then
1:17:31
you click on Advanced DNS and then this is the section where we're going to be adding some details so it's under the
1:17:38
host records so we're going to come here and click on add new record and when we checked here the first record was an a
1:17:44
record record type is a and then we're going to enter this so I'm just going to copy this control C then I come back
1:17:51
here and then as you can see it's an a record so it was the host was a record
1:17:56
type is a host name is a is at so I'll just leave this I'll just do that then
1:18:02
the IP address that's that and then we're just going to click on Save
1:18:07
changes by ticking and now it's been added there then we're going to click again add new record and we're going to
1:18:14
see the second one it's it's a c name record www and then Marshall
1:18:21
malaba live.com just like that so so we're going to come back here and scroll until
1:18:27
we get to where it says C name record for the value the host is www www like that and then we're going
1:18:35
to click on Save changes and once you have done that that's all that you would need to do for now what will then happen
1:18:41
is that it's the everything that we have set up is going through a a process that's called propagation whereby the
1:18:48
website is being connected to the domain provider and this process can sometimes take anywhere from about five minutes to
1:18:55
about maybe 30 minutes sometimes to even 24 hours so you just have to uh leave it
1:19:00
uh for a while now whilst recording this video it wait I waited for about 30 minutes and then I was able to check and
1:19:08
then now I see that my domain is actually connected as you can see Marsh malabal live.com if I just refresh this
1:19:15
again it comes back to this exact same page so now not only is my website here
1:19:21
on this page where I'm I'm actually working on it and developing it here but now actually if I share this link with
1:19:27
anyone people can actually find my website and these details the next thing that we then need to do is that we need
1:19:33
to connect emails so that we'll be able to send out emails using the domain that
1:19:38
we have chosen we want to be able to receive emails and be able to send out emails as well so what we're going to do
1:19:45
is that we're just going to click here where it says emails and automations and then when you come here on the dashboard
1:19:50
you're just going to scroll down to the bottom and click where it says connect a domain the other ways to come here and
1:19:55
click on settings and you look for the same option to Connected domain but I'm just going to click here it says connected domain and then it's going to
1:20:02
ask me to add a domain and then in this section here you're going to add the domain that you want to use so it's
1:20:08
going to be Marshall malava live.com just like that and then I click
1:20:14
on submit now the next page that it will show you is this one and what it needs you to do is that you need to verify
1:20:21
your domain to verify your domain add the following txt records to your domain d uh DNS so we're just
1:20:28
going to have to copy these details and then paste them and I'll show you where to paste them so what you need to do
1:20:34
next is that you need to take these details and then you're going to put them in name chip again like we did
1:20:40
earlier on if you have Pro probably maybe closed the tab uh you just loog
1:20:46
into your name chip you click on domain list and then you identify the domain and then you click on Advanced DNS then
1:20:52
it will bring you to this page what what you're going to do is that you're going to click here and say add new record and
1:20:58
then the type of record is txt records and then we're going to be adding name
1:21:04
is at or leave it blank and then the value so I'm just going to click on this
1:21:09
to copy that so I'm going to scroll down and look for txt record the
1:21:15
host is at and then the value it's this that I copied uh right here then when
1:21:22
I'm done I just click on check Mark there so that it saves and I'm going to come and going to ask me to authenticate
1:21:29
emails to authenticate your emails via DK add the following C name record so
1:21:35
I'm going to come here okay let me copy this first says name and value and it's going to be a c name so I'm going to add
1:21:42
new record I'm going to scroll down to C Name
1:21:47
Records and then this is where I'm going to paste name
1:21:55
I put that on the host and then the value copy that and I
1:22:02
paste that and then I click on that again then I can click on this option which says save all changes once you
1:22:08
click on save all all the records will then be saved onto your name chip account then all you have to do is then
1:22:15
go back to your account in Creator and then you just simply need to just
1:22:21
refresh the page and you'll see your domain there it will say pending and authorization pending so all you just
1:22:28
have to do is wait a couple of hours and then this is going to change from pending um to verify it as you can see
1:22:34
this one that's above don't worry about this other link here it's because I I own other domains for you it's just
1:22:40
going to be written your the domain that you currently own the next thing that we then need to do is set up email hosting
1:22:46
so that we'll be able to receive emails and also be able to uh reply emails when
1:22:51
people send us emails so we need to find a email hosting company and there's an email hosting company that you can use
1:22:57
which has got a free plan it's called Zoho you just go to zoho.com and then
1:23:03
you're going to click here where it says um mail so we're going to be using Zoho Mail we're going to click on sign up now
1:23:09
and then we're going to click where it says pricing and then you notice that they have got different pricing plans we're
1:23:15
going to go scroll down all the way to the bottom well near the bottom and look for this one which says forever free
1:23:22
plan in other words we're going to be using this software for free forever then we click on sign up now
1:23:28
then on this page you're just going to enter your name and then an email address that you are currently using
1:23:33
because they're going to want you to verify um your ownership of either email account so you just use an email address
1:23:39
that you are currently using and then you create a password so I'm going to do that shortly so once you've entered your name your email and your password you
1:23:46
just want to click where it says I agree to the terms of service and privacy policy and then you're going to click on
1:23:51
sign up then they'll send you an OTP as you can see just to confirm your email
1:23:57
address so as you can see an OTP has been sent to me here I'm just going to copy this number then come back here
1:24:04
paste it there click verify and then this is where I start
1:24:09
doing the setup so there are two options there add an existing domain buy a new domain we want to go with the option
1:24:15
that says add an existing domain so I'm just going to click on ADD now and then type in the name of my
1:24:22
domain just like that for company name I'm just going to add
1:24:28
my name and then industry type you can choose industry type I usually go for
1:24:35
something that says uh marketing or something that says advertising so marketing and
1:24:44
advertising then it says proceed to domain verification congratulations M
1:24:50
Mala has been added sucess successfully then proceed to domain verification I click on that so this is the first page
1:24:57
that you will see and all we're going to be doing is we're going to be following the same process
1:25:02
that we've been following all along we're going to be copying some txt records and then placing them into our
1:25:07
name chip account so I'm going to loog into my name chip account and then I'm
1:25:13
going to go to DNS settings again there is my domain then I'm going
1:25:19
to click on Advanced DNS and then I'm going to come here it says add new record
1:25:24
and so the record I'm going to be adding is a txt I can put the add or leave it blank
1:25:30
and then the value so I'm just going to copy that value then I'm going to come here so I'm
1:25:37
just going to look for txt record I'm just going to say add and
1:25:42
then the value paste that there and then I click
1:25:47
on Save changes and then it's been added
1:25:54
then I'll come back here it says you may have to wait 30 minutes to one day for this change this change to propagate
1:26:00
depending on the TTL value that you've entered finally come back to this page and click on the below button to
1:26:05
complete the domain verification process so like they mentioned it's going to take a bit of time but I can go ahead
1:26:11
and just proceed to the next steps so verify txt so as you can see there this area
1:26:18
here which says txt verification failure and the reason why is because it may take some it may take a while so what
1:26:25
I'm going to do is I'm just going to wait for a few minutes and I'll let you know how long it took so it actually
1:26:30
took me less than 1 minute so I tried it again and then it was now working then
1:26:36
it now brings me to this page you have now verified your domain ownership you are the super administrator so now I
1:26:42
need to create the email account that I want to use as a super administrator so I'm just going to type here Marshall so
1:26:49
it's the email that's going to be the Super administrator it's going to be Marshall Marshall malaba live
1:26:55
or I can use um whatever I want to use my name or CEO or whatever it is that
1:27:00
you want to use but something that just going to be your main email address so I'm just going to use that and click on
1:27:06
create then it will bring me to this dashboard here and as you can see there's my main email address that I'll
1:27:12
be using that's going to be the main um that's going to be the main email
1:27:17
administrator and then what I can then do is that I can create other accounts as well for example I can click here it
1:27:23
says add and then I can create I'll just call this OB the name is
1:27:28
Marshall um malava in this is like let's say maybe you want to create an account
1:27:34
for someone else who's on your team but for now I'm just doing it for myself and then I'll just change this to support so
1:27:42
it's going to be support at Marshal malabal live.com and then I can create a
1:27:47
password make sure that the password fits in all these can you see these green ticks that are appearing here you
1:27:53
have to just follow that in other words one caps um one big word then small letters
1:28:01
numbers and then a special key now there's an option here which says Force user to change password on
1:28:07
first login in other words when you assign this to someone they can log in using the password which you will tell
1:28:13
them but then they then need to then create their own password so you can choose that option if you want I'm just going to untick it for now then click on
1:28:20
ADD so as you can see now I've got two different emails that I can use use so you can go ahead and create as many as
1:28:26
you would need maybe for your team but for now I'm just going to stop here um so that we don't waste too much time on
1:28:32
this so I then come here to the bottom and click on proceed to set up groups now groups is basically um a way
1:28:40
that you can arrange like let's say maybe you're running a big company you can group your the your employees and
1:28:46
their different emails into categories for example maybe there's the accounting department there three people that work
1:28:52
there you can put them into groups marketing department the people work there you can put them in groups so I'm not going to use this right now click on
1:28:58
proceed to DNS mapping then there's more details that
1:29:03
we need to copy here again now on this page it's as it's called DNS mapping and
1:29:09
basically we need to copy all these details and put them into our name chip
1:29:14
uh account like we have been doing with all the other records so what we do is that we just simply come here to our
1:29:22
domain and I'm just going to scroll scroll down until I find where it
1:29:28
says mail settings right here and this will only work if you are
1:29:34
logged in by the way so make sure that you are logged into your account and then click on where it says mail
1:29:39
settings and then email forwarding you want to scroll down and look for custom MX click on custom MX and then you'll
1:29:47
see it written MX record so you're going to copy those details the first one MX at mx.com and
1:29:56
notice that it says priority 10 so I'm going to come here I'm going to put the priority to B 10 and the first part the
1:30:05
host was just add then I'm just going to click on save all changes then click on
1:30:11
add new record it's going to be add
1:30:17
here that there and then we put that as 20 and C the check but there then add record MX3
1:30:29
and then for the next one as we can see here it's a txt I'm just going to click on view SPF
1:30:38
value replace the existing txt record with below zost BF or replace the
1:30:45
existing txt record with a below merged value I'm going to copy this bottom one
1:30:50
because we already have got some txt records then we're going to come back up here to where we were setting the host
1:30:58
records and then we're going to click on add new record and then we look for the txt
1:31:04
record and then for the value we're going to paste that and then for the host just going to click on
1:31:11
okay the host is ADD so we click on
1:31:18
ADD and then save changes there
1:31:24
and then we come back to txt again but then this time we're going to add this Z
1:31:29
mail for the host then we click on
1:31:35
ADD records there we scroll down to txt records host we're going to paste that
1:31:43
there then for the value we're going to go and copy this then we come here and
1:31:49
we paste it under value and then we're going to save and then we are done with
1:31:54
that so what we then can do is that we can click on verify all records and once
1:32:00
again it may take a bit of time but generally what will happen is that these colors here will turn to Green so I'm
1:32:06
just going to click on it see what happens the DNS records may take a while
1:32:12
depending on the TDL to get propagated like I explained I'm just going to click on okay but then I'm just I'm just going
1:32:17
to click on to proceed to email migration so data migration is when you already perhaps or you already have like
1:32:25
an email list and you want to move those emails to this new account so we're not going to do that we're just going to
1:32:31
click on proceed to go mobile then go mobile is just basically for you to download apps that you can use on your
1:32:38
phones to monitor your your emails so if you click here it's going to take you to the the
1:32:44
play store or the App Store where you can find the apps that you can use so the main one that we use on mobile is
1:32:50
called Zoho Mail but anyway I'm going to click on proceed to s setup completion
1:32:55
and then your setup is complete and then as you can see it says check out your
1:33:01
inbox I'm just going to click on check out my inbox then as you can see this is what my inbox is going to look like
1:33:06
whenever someone sends me an email it will come here to my inbox um already they are now giving me like just a
1:33:12
welcome message and a short tutorial on how to use the platform but I'm going to click on skip you can use it yourself so
1:33:18
that you can just familiarize yourself with it and here's another one here but I'm just going to click on on
1:33:24
Skip and so it just works like any other email inbox outbox um drafts templates
1:33:31
spam you name it so in order to just access this you just simply go to uh
1:33:38
zohomail.com as you can see here and then if you are maybe using a
1:33:45
new account or something you're going to it's going to ask you to sign in but
1:33:50
since I'm already signed in here access mail then is going to bring me to my inbox where we are already at over there
1:33:57
and let's say for example you want to just maybe go back to admin and add more emails like I showed you earlier on
1:34:03
you're just going to come here way it says my profile click on my profile and then you can click on says admin console
1:34:11
and then you're going to basically have all those options that we had earlier on when we were setting this up for example
1:34:17
if you want to add more people I just click on users and this is where I can add more users
1:34:24
but now let's just test this to make sure that it's actually working so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to write there uh new email and then send
1:34:31
it to my other email address Marshall at
1:34:39
your.com subject testing we are live that's the message
1:34:47
and then I'm just going to say send as you can see it says message
1:34:54
sent and then when I log into my email address the one that I normally use for
1:34:59
everything as you can see right here there is the email Marshall Marshal malaba live.com and I just received that email
1:35:06
it says we are live in other words it's working so I'm also just going to reply
1:35:11
and say yes it's working I'm just going to send
1:35:19
that reply back then I'm just going to go back to that account
1:35:24
as you can see there's currently two emails here from Zoho and then there comes the email from Marshall so it's
1:35:31
working 100% now that our emails are working what we then need to do is that we need to assign the emails that we'll
1:35:38
be sending out emails in our autoresponder in Creator HQ so what you
1:35:44
just want to do is that come back here where it says emails and automations then we're just going to click on settings and if you remember earlier on
1:35:50
we set up our domain and it was pending but as you can see now it's verified because it now has propagated but anyway
1:35:57
that's not what we're focusing on we want to click here where it says brand details and then here you're going to fill in the details just simply entering
1:36:05
your company name your company address default sender name default email def
1:36:10
default system email so I'm just going to fill this in quickly I'm going to add my name I'm going to add my address and
1:36:16
then for default send the name that's where I put my name and then
1:36:21
default email this is where I put the new email that I've have created so it's going to be Marshall at Marshall
1:36:30
malava live.com right then there's default
1:36:36
system email this is the default email address used for system emails EG
1:36:42
e-commerce emails so I can go ahead and use the same one that I just set up or if I want um like earlier on I said that
1:36:49
you can create other emails like maybe support or info or reply to but I'm just
1:36:55
going to use mine as the default for now then one once I'm done I'm just going to click on Save okay so now we are at the
1:37:02
fun part where we're talking about how to actually get clients what can you do to get your first client what I'm going
1:37:08
to do is that I'm going to share with you different ways that you can use to find clients what I'm going to do is
1:37:14
that in each different way I'm going to break it down into a short video then you just can go through all the videos
1:37:19
and then you can choose which method you want to start with or which one you want going to focus on the most I'm also
1:37:25
going to put some links to some different YouTube videos and resources that I think will help you to be able to
1:37:31
uh know how to find clients how to reach out to them talk to them and get people to actually sign up uh to work with you
1:37:39
and then you build their platforms so the first thing that you want to do is that you want to reach out to local
1:37:45
businesses and get them on as clients and the way that you're going to do that is firstly you're going to choose a
1:37:50
niche you're going to focus on one Niche well this works for any type of Niche by Niche I mean like maybe you can work
1:37:57
with lawyers you can work with accountants you can work with restaurants you can work with online stores but for this particular one you
1:38:03
want to choose one Niche first and then what you then do after you've decided on your Niche you then come here create a
1:38:09
HQ and you look for templates for that particular Niche for example I've just clicked here and I've come to the
1:38:15
restaurant Niche and as you can see here are different templates that if I just click on them I'll be able to build a
1:38:22
whole website using the template that has already been created I don't have to do much here I just simply need to come
1:38:28
in and edit like here say where it says restaurant I can put the logo I can change the menu options if I want uh I
1:38:34
can change the pictures whatever I can change the prices and so this is what I'm going to be focusing on and so now
1:38:41
why it's important for you to pick a niche is because it gathers all those types of businesses together and you're
1:38:46
able to identify them easily what I mean by that is if you come to Google and you
1:38:51
type in for example and say restaurants near me or restaurants in your location
1:38:56
in this case I'm just going to say restaurants in Cape Town CBD if I type in that it's going to show
1:39:03
me all the different restaurants that are in uh the location that I set up well I live in Cape Town so that's why
1:39:09
I'm using this I'm going to click here where it says maps and then it's going to show me a map overview of Cape toown
1:39:17
CBD and it will show me the different restaurants that are there
1:39:23
so as you can see just by going through this I'm able to see all the different restaurants that are in the Cape Town uh
1:39:31
CBD so the way that you're going to be finding clients is firstly you're just
1:39:36
going to go through all these different ones and firstly you're going to identify the ones that don't have a
1:39:43
website number two you're going to identify the ones that maybe they have got a website but the website is
1:39:50
terrible it hasn't been updated in a long time that gives you an indicator of that these are people that I might be
1:39:55
able to uh reach out to so like if I just click on this one
1:40:03
first if I then check here I'll be able to see if they have got a website or not
1:40:09
I can just need to come here and just scroll and look and see if there's a website so here's the website link here
1:40:16
I'm just going to click on that it's going to open here and then this is their website so I'll just go through
1:40:22
the website and check okay is this a nice website is this a cool website uh can I make some changes here can I
1:40:28
update this if there's nothing that I find that I can add off value to these people I'll just leave it alone and I'll
1:40:34
go to the next one maybe let me just come to this one it's called Tomo restaurant click on it and we see what
1:40:41
comes up there okay I will then come here and search
1:40:48
and see if they have got a website I'm seeing this link here I can click on
1:40:55
that and we see what pops up and as you can see this seems to be
1:41:02
the website as you can see there's not much Happening Here not much activity
1:41:08
there's just the option for the menu and can you see I'm trying to click on it nothing is happening there um so this
1:41:16
might be an opportunity for me to actually reach out to these guys and offer my services compare this website
1:41:22
that you are seeing here to these templates that I've just shown you right
1:41:27
it's to me it's a no-brainer I can make a beautiful website like this for them in minutes so this might be one of the
1:41:34
people that I will reach out to so there are different ways that I can reach out to them because it's in a location
1:41:39
that's near me I actually can just walk there and talk to them and say that hey
1:41:45
I'm a web designer and I'd like to redesign your website for you and because you're using these templates you
1:41:52
actually can go ahead and and create we call them mockups you create a website for them you just come in here you
1:41:58
change the the logo here maybe just change it to their colors make it nice and beautiful and show that you actually
1:42:05
put time and effort into it so that now when you go and approach them you actually approaching them with their
1:42:10
full functional website right and then if they like it and they love it and they say no this is something that we
1:42:16
actually want they then going to sign up depending on how much you're actually going to be charging them they'll be
1:42:21
able to pay and then you are able to set up all this uh for them so as you can see here these guys definitely needs uh
1:42:28
some touchups they definitely need help with their website so that's just two websites that I've shown you here what
1:42:35
you're going to be doing is that you're going to be going through all this list here because there going to be hundreds
1:42:40
and hundreds of different uh companies that will pop up here some of them have got websites that are good and excellent
1:42:47
you can leave them alone some of them got websites that need work like I just showed you that one the last one right
1:42:52
now then some of them when you click you realize that there is no website so that's an opportunity for you to then
1:42:59
create a website markup for them reach out to them and then actually offer to build the website uh for them and like I
1:43:06
mentioned there are two ways that you can approach them you actually can go and visit them in person because it's in a local area near to you or as you can
1:43:12
see here there's a phone number you can excuse me you can actually give them a call and talk to them set up an
1:43:18
appointment and tell them that this is what you want to do but also there's also the option for social media there
1:43:24
it's another option if you click there it's going to open up their Facebook page you also can reach out to them so
1:43:29
depending on what you're comfortable to do you just simply do that and that's how you're going to be getting your
1:43:35
clients and one more thing that I just want to mention is when you are building websites don't only focus on just
1:43:41
creating a nice looking website but you also want to make sure that it's a functional website what I mean by
1:43:47
functional website is like can you see here on this template here it says book now so a lot of times like especially
1:43:53
for restaurants when people go on to the website first thing that maybe they're asking for is the menu there must be
1:43:59
somewhere where people can access and see the menu and maybe even download it and maybe also there's a option where
1:44:06
people want to make a booking they say that okay your restaurant looks nice I want to come at 600 PM later on can I make a booking there must be that option
1:44:13
for people to make make that booking so maybe right there at the top you want to put like can you see it says call you
1:44:19
want to put a button that if someone clicks on it they're able to call the uh the restaurant directly without them
1:44:27
having to copy the number but just by clicking the button they on on their mobile phone automatically it leads to
1:44:33
the dialer and it just dials and they're able to call or maybe the other option is for them to when they click on book
1:44:39
now it opens up a WhatsApp chat right and then automatically you as oh sorry
1:44:45
the business owner automatically gets a WhatsApp message someone is asking about the menu someone is wanting to make a
1:44:51
booking they're able to get that information there and then a lot of the websites that you will find are just
1:44:56
static websites meaning that there's no interaction people can't get feedback
1:45:02
this guy who owns this website um maybe like you people will tell him I went to your website and I tried to make a
1:45:08
booking I couldn't make a booking he won't get the information or or or he won't know when customers are trying to
1:45:13
reach out to him and are trying to maybe just get get a booking or find out some information about their website but if
1:45:19
you make it a website whereby people are able to uh send information in send
1:45:24
messages instantly that provides more value to the business owner because they're able to know and see that okay
1:45:31
these are people who are actually going to a website and um I'm able to help them so yeah those are some of the
1:45:37
things there are many other things that you maybe also want to include for example maybe just putting an option for
1:45:42
people to sign up for the newsletter these are different things that help uh
1:45:47
businesses to keep in contact with their clients it's important for you to for people to sign up uh for maybe like a
1:45:54
newsletter or create something that is of value to them it's important for that so that in those days like maybe when
1:46:00
business is not doing so well because you've collected someone's email or you connected their phone number you're able
1:46:05
to make promotions and say hey we are doing um 40% off today if you come
1:46:10
between 12:00 and 2 pm right you're able to create those different promotions so that's what I mean by creating a
1:46:17
functional website and if you just do this this is going to be the first and one of the best ways that you actually can start getting our clients super fast
1:46:25
so summary you're going to identify Niche right in this case we talked about
1:46:30
restaurants then once you've identified that Niche you go to Google and type in that Niche near me you go to Google Maps
1:46:37
and you look for the different businesses look for the ones that need websites the ones that need website upgrades and then you simply walk to
1:46:43
them and talk to them or number two you call them or number three you message them on social media and you just get
1:46:50
those appointments for you to help them to build their websites now that you've
1:46:55
got your own website with your portfolio on your website and you've chosen your Niche the next step is for you to start
1:47:00
finding clients now there are so many different ways that you can approach finding clients in fact I'll need to
1:47:06
make lots of different videos to talk about the different methods of finding clients but I'm just going to show you
1:47:11
three different ideas of how you can find clients the first one is to use your current contacts you might think
1:47:17
but I don't have any contacts that want to do business with me but you might just be surprised that you might
1:47:23
actually know people who actually need website design so what you're going to do is that you're going to come up with
1:47:28
your own message that looks like something like this you're going to say hey so and so so and so meaning their
1:47:33
name obviously I'm excited to let you know that I have just started my old website design business and I'm looking
1:47:39
to help then mention the type of people that you want to help or maybe the niche that you want to focus on I am looking
1:47:44
to help mention the type of business and then mention what you the website design is going to help them to achieve for
1:47:51
example I'm looking to help Lo firms to gain more customers by building a website that would allow people to book
1:47:57
calls see schedule of when the lawyers are available and also create awareness in the local environment that this Law
1:48:03
Firm exists and where people can actually come to visit the lawyers then you continue to say if you know anyone
1:48:10
who might be interested in this please reply to me and let me know now you can take this any way that you want but
1:48:16
after you've come up with your own message what you're going to do is that you're going to reach out to every single one of your contacts is of legal
1:48:23
age and you're just going to Simply send them this message now that means that you're going to be sending to your contacts on WhatsApp you're going to be
1:48:29
sending to your contacts on your social media platforms like Facebook like Instagram like Twitter simply go to your
1:48:36
contact Section and just send the message to everyone you can also go into your Gmail account maybe you had a Gmail
1:48:43
or whatever service provider you use for your emails you've been using for 5 years and you have emailed back and
1:48:49
forth with so many different people your job is simply to send the email to them now the nice part about this method is
1:48:55
that some of these people actually know you and they might not know that you will run a business or have done
1:49:01
business with you but because they've got some of a relationship with you some of them might be willing to give you a
1:49:07
chance now what will then happen is that some of these people are going to ignore you and say absolutely nothing that's
1:49:12
normal and it happens it's okay but then some of these people might actually do what you are saying and then go forward
1:49:18
your message to someone that they know might actually need a website if they do that it might also be a good idea to
1:49:23
include your contact details in that message that they forwarding and then thirdly some of these people might
1:49:28
actually be someone who needs the website so though you're asking them do you know someone someone might just say
1:49:34
Yes actually I do need a website and then you can then start talking to them from that point so don't be shy just
1:49:39
simply send out the message and you'll be shocked that you might actually just get your first customer by doing that
1:49:44
and another thing that you can do which is similar to what I just explained is that you can actually do the whole same
1:49:49
process for all your social media profiles for example let's that you use Facebook a lot you can simply make an
1:49:55
announcement on your Facebook just make a post and say the same words but then you just change them a bit just to make
1:50:01
sense for Facebook you're going to be letting people know that hey I've started my own website design business and then tell them like the types of
1:50:08
people that you want to work with and then tell them that if you know anyone who needs help with this I'll be
1:50:13
available and and and ready to help they can just leave your comment or they can just send you a TM so you can do the
1:50:19
same thing on Facebook you can do the same thing on your status on WhatsApp you can do the same thing on your Instagram whatever social media platform
1:50:26
you like to use make sure that you're just posting that message and the whole idea is that you are trying to get
1:50:32
people to actually um see this new thing that you are doing and then some of them will reach out to you and actually ask
1:50:37
you for help now because a lot of these people are your friends and family members a lot of them will not be your
1:50:43
ideal client but it's just a way for you to find your first client right they
1:50:49
might refer you to that one person who might actually need you Services now while you're doing this process the next
1:50:55
two questions you probably have are how much am I going to be charging for my website design services and secondly
1:51:01
what exactly am I going to be offering in these Services make sure that you check out these videos next that will give you answers to those questions in
1:51:09
today's video let's talk about how you can get unlimited clients by creating content on social media now I don't know
1:51:15
if youve noticed but more and more people are creating content on a daily basis and you can actually use content
1:51:21
creation or social media is a tool that you can get clients for yourself now there's so many different ways that we
1:51:27
talk about getting clients on this channel but one of the best ways that you encage an automated approach or an
1:51:33
unlimited number of clients for yourself is by creating content so you see me in this place right now I'm currently on
1:51:39
holiday and one of the things that allows me to be able to travel and to buit these amazing beautiful places all
1:51:46
around Africa and all around the world is the fact that I share content the more people watch my content they reach
1:51:52
out I me ask help with the different things that I talk about and one of the most specific thing is website design
1:51:58
because I create content about website design people reach out to me now compan maybe spends a lot of time maybe just
1:52:04
sending emails uh different companies and to different people client into clients this approach is actually better
1:52:11
and I want to show you how to actually approach it it's it's so much better why because people see you on social media
1:52:17
platforms and they start reaching out such have pressure terms of like
1:52:23
where am I going to get my CL they will be reaching out to you so there's a step by step that you can actually use I'm
1:52:29
not saying now you have to become an influencer not saying that now you have to spend a lot of time um buying
1:52:35
expensive equipment to that you get repord yourself things like that but I'll show you how simple you can approach this such that you a great
1:52:42
content that's going to help you to find unlimited clients let's get into it okay so firstly I want to give you examples
1:52:48
of different people who are actually using social media as a tool for them getting clients so one lady that I
1:52:55
follow her company name is sind Seda or k branding whatever you want to call it
1:53:01
and um this is her Tik Tok page you can actually just go and search for it yourself she basically talks a lot about
1:53:07
website design and she's just basically creating content talking about her process um how she builds websites how
1:53:14
she actually helps people um with the website designs that she does so what
1:53:20
you can do as someone who wants to learn how to also create content that will bring clients is that you can just
1:53:26
simply come here and watch the type of content that she is creating because you don't have to reinvent the wheel you
1:53:32
just simply need to find people who are already doing well in what you're trying to achieve and then you just copy ideas
1:53:38
from them so just going to come here watch some of her content and then you get ideas of content that you can create
1:53:45
for your um self here's another lady uh who's also doing very well for herself her name is Bea Luna she also talks
1:53:51
about websites design a lot and she's making crazy amounts of money she's charging $12,000
1:53:56
$15,000 for her website design right I'd encourage you to just uh follow these
1:54:02
two people that I've showed you they will talk a lot about website design and you can copy their whole process but you
1:54:07
notice something about both of them right for every time they create um well on a daily basis they create content
1:54:13
that they just share but if you check in their profiles all of them have got these links that link to something uh
1:54:19
whether it's their web for you to book a with them and talk to them potentially
1:54:25
for you to hire uh them for their services like this lady here she's bringing you directly to a website where
1:54:31
she's got a couple of courses that she's offering people can book calls with her and then become her clients and so
1:54:38
because she creates so much content on Tik Tok she's not struggling to find clients as you can see she's got 1.7
1:54:44
million likes every single day someone is reaching out to and asking that can you design my website and so rather than
1:54:51
her struggling to get she chooses which clients she wants to work with you actually can get to a
1:54:57
point where by you just have a whole back list like L's say maybe 25 people who want to work with you and then you
1:55:03
tell them I'm only available as from uh right now we're currently in the middle of July let's say in August September
1:55:09
that's when I'm available and some of them are actually willing to pay you a deposit in advance to book your time 3
1:55:16
months later 2 months later that's how business can be done that's power of social media it's able B to create that
1:55:23
effect for you back to this lady again since notice she also has got a link there that she when people click on that
1:55:29
link and they can go and find the different things that she's offering she's also offering like some course
1:55:35
programs she's also offering like one-on-one consultation that people can come and get with her it doesn't mean
1:55:41
that you also need to go and create a course right now probably you watching this you're not not just at the stage where you should even be thinking about
1:55:47
creating courses but I'm just trying to show you the funnel and the setup that they use they create content that
1:55:53
content draws eyes and attention from people people uh she then tells people that if you want to work with me or you
1:55:59
want my resources go to the link in my bio click there and also on their content people are always asking
1:56:05
questions right you check out like there's lots of comments like let's say this video here has got 25,000 um views
1:56:11
if you just go to the video you notice that people are leaving lots of comments she's answering the questions that people are asking right and some of
1:56:18
those people are becoming clients some of those people are just asking for advice she's giving fre advice but she's positioning herself as someone who
1:56:24
actually knows what she is um doing and she's the right person to work with and maybe you're feeling like okay I'm not
1:56:30
good at video content I'm not good at putting myself in front of a camera another tool that you can also use is
1:56:36
like Twitter or it's now known as X here's another guy who's also started out as a website designer but now he
1:56:42
talks mostly about freelancing his name is uh Mike follow him a lot he got some really great content it be good for you
1:56:48
to actually follow him this guy just creates content talking about the challenges that people in his industry
1:56:54
are facing and then he posts about it on Twitter and as you can see like for example he just wrote this message how
1:57:00
my coaching program that helped my students make 15,000 right he's explaining how he helped his students
1:57:06
look how many people saw this post 199,000 people around the world saw this post are you telling me that from
1:57:12
999,000 you can't even get one or two who are willing to pay you $1,000 or $2,000 or maybe $10,000 or more
1:57:19
obviously you're going to be getting more clients so all this is stuff that you can learn you at first when you hear
1:57:25
me talk about that now you need to create content you're going to be fearful you're going to be worried is this something that I can actually do
1:57:31
it's something that you can learn to do right and if you want me to show you how
1:57:36
you can easily approach this and learn it uh in a simple way I'm just going to show you shortly but let me just finish
1:57:41
talking about this guy you notice he just creates content he talks about his Niche he talks about the types of
1:57:48
clients he's trying to help he talks about the problems that they're facing and how to solve them using uh the tools
1:57:54
that he knows about and because of that he gets people's attention people watch his content people reach out to him he
1:57:59
gets clients uh that way and you'll notice also he has got a link just like the other ladies this link can take
1:58:06
people to his coaching programs to his calendar where you can book go with him and then they'll talk about his program
1:58:12
he can help you um or maybe he can help build your website whatever it is they all use that funnel whereby they create
1:58:19
content first the content leads people to the Link in the bio they click the link in the bio the book holds and they
1:58:25
buy the stuff that he's selling so now if you're worried about okay how do I learn to create conted right chat GPT is
1:58:32
your best ring you can just simply come and ask chat GPT um give me 20
1:58:40
ideas of content I can create for Tik
1:58:48
Tok to talk about my
1:58:54
website design service right um obviously I me
1:58:59
I'm spelling mistakes there but CH GPT knows what I'm trying to say right it's going to give me ideas of
1:59:05
content that I can create all you simply need to do is just follow right now
1:59:12
let's just say okay it's going to give me uh what did I ask for 20 ideas let me just pick one of these website design
1:59:17
tips right while it's typing there I'm going to C website design tips
1:59:23
give me three scripts of
1:59:30
website design tips I can talk
1:59:37
about they should be less
1:59:42
than 16
1:59:48
seconds strip number one the importance of mobile friendly design all I just need to do is read the script
1:59:55
and say what chat GPT is is telling me to to say hey Tik Tok it's Marshall from
2:00:00
Creator HQ and today I want to talk about having a mobile friendly website did you know that over half of web
2:00:07
traffic comes from mobile devices if your site isn't optimized for mobile you could be losing a ton of potential
2:00:13
clients make sure your website is responsive meaning it automatically adjust to fit any screen size test your
2:00:19
site on different devices to ensure everything looks great and functions properly don't let the poor poorly
2:00:24
design mobile sites drive away your audience follow for more website design tips I just read that and I already have
2:00:32
a script so now all I do is I put my phone there in front of me and I say out
2:00:37
what I just read and one secret that a lot of people don't know about creating video content most people think that
2:00:43
content creators just talk at the camera at one goal because they know everything
2:00:48
and they're just so confident a lot of times we make mistakes so in this video I'm not making any mistakes I'm just recording it once
2:00:55
because I'm looking at my screen and I'm just describing what I'm seeing but sometimes when you want to use like
2:01:01
let's say a script like this you forget you can say this first part first but then you forget what comes next so what
2:01:07
you do is that you look at this first part and then you say it out and then you pae and you look at your notes again
2:01:14
and then you continue and then what you do is that you use video editing software whether it's going to be on
2:01:19
your phone or on your laptop to then edit those videos right and remove the
2:01:24
gaps remove the mistakes that you make and because definitely you're going to make mistakes and definitely you're
2:01:29
going to be saying um um um especially when it's your first times and definitely you're going to make mistakes
2:01:35
and feel like nah this is not for me it's for you you need to do it um you will get better the more you do it right
2:01:43
so I've just shown you here the secret hack that the best way for you to actually get content ideas there's the
2:01:48
first script here's the second script there's the the third script and did you see I asked it earlier on for 20 ideas
2:01:55
and I just went to one of them I said website design tips give me three it's already given me three so if I say three
2:02:02
for all of these 20 3 by 20 that's what 60 those have 60 different videos that
2:02:10
you can create I have got the scripts already and it's been less than 10 minutes of me sharing this video I've
2:02:15
already shown you how to create 60 different videos so the only excuse that you have is that you are lazy and you
2:02:22
don't want to do the work that's the only reason why you will find yourself failing to do this if you don't want to
2:02:29
do video content you can do the same thing for Twitter right see this guy he's using the exact same approach you
2:02:36
can change what I said there about Tik Tok and say for Twitter right there somewhere where I wrote 20 ideas um for
2:02:43
Tik Tok I can change this to to Twitter and it's going to type out all
2:02:48
this that I just wrote like they wa it was this you can make these threads take this exact make it a thread take this
2:02:55
next one make it a thread next next next and your post on Twitter and you're going to be getting people to see your
2:03:01
content get to know you as someone who creates content that they can trust and then they're going to start reaching out
2:03:07
to you let me know your thoughts in the comment section if you've got any questions uh let me know and I'll just
2:03:13
do my best to answer hoping that you can get started with this and it's going to help you to grow with website design one
2:03:19
of the first questions you need to answer when you start your website design agency journey is how much are
2:03:24
you going to be charging for your website design Services now this can be a very tricky question especially if you
2:03:30
have never done this before firstly you don't want to overcharge such that you're now chasing customers away for
2:03:36
example you're charging $5,000 reaching out to new startup businesses they have an intention of making money but at the
2:03:42
start they might not have that amount of money to pay you for a website design also you don't want to charge too cheap
2:03:49
for example I've seen people charging as low as $100 uh it can make sense to charge that
2:03:54
amount when you're starting out but the problem is that it's not money that can actually give you the Financial Freedom
2:04:00
that you're seeking out as a website design business owner right but then
2:04:05
also at the same time you don't want to undercharge yourself and reach out to clients that have got huge budgets and
2:04:11
then you're charging them for example let's say $1,000 for a website and yet they've got a $25,000 budget for
2:04:17
building their website in their marketing to them they will just feel like you are too cheap and you don't know what you're are doing so you need
2:04:24
to find a workaround that works for you that allows you to be able to reach out
2:04:29
to clients give them your prices and they will be willing to actually pay you the amount of money that you want so the
2:04:35
first thing that you're going to need to do is that you're going to need to calculate how much is going to cost you
2:04:40
actually to build a website and so the way that we do that is by going to the Creator HQ website and we're just going
2:04:46
to click on plans and pricing so that we can get an understanding of how much does it cost us to actually build a
2:04:52
website now you notice that there are two plans there there's a yearly plan and then there's a monthly plan and then of course there are these different
2:04:58
packages but I'm just going to be working with the lowest one which is $39 per month if you're paying for the whole
2:05:04
year but if the person is paying month to month they're going to be paying $49 per month so what I'd recommend that you
2:05:11
do is that you take this figure of $39 per month and then you just go to a calculator and then you calculate and
2:05:18
say $39 time 12 months and then that's the amount of money that is going to cost
2:05:24
you to have a website running on Creator HQ for the whole year
2:05:29
$468 now depending on which country you are in especially most of the people that watch my content you are based in
2:05:34
South Africa you might want to calculate there's $468 then maybe just say in in Rand
2:05:41
468 um dollars in Rand like this so that you can get the average amount of money
2:05:47
that someone has to pay for the website to be running for the whole year here right that's
2:05:53
856 R but I'm just going to keep talking in dollars because I understand we're all from different uh countries so it's
2:06:00
$468 that we got here to keep the website simply running so when you are charging you should not charge less than
2:06:08
$468 because that's the minimum for the website to be running and then what I normally do myself is that I would
2:06:13
double that amount and it come up to maybe about a round figure of $1,000 for their for me to build a
2:06:19
website for my uh client that way I know that the figure or the platform is
2:06:24
covered but then also I'm making a bit of profit in some cases there are some people who might say that it's a bit
2:06:30
expensive for them especially if you're targeting people that are just startups and they don't yet have money that's
2:06:35
when I will give them the option to say that okay maybe I'll build the website for slightly less and maybe just say as
2:06:41
a beginner I'm charging $300 to build the website but then they then need to
2:06:46
pay the $49 per month monthly fee uh to keep the website running $300 is just an
2:06:54
example for someone who is a beginner but as you learn the skill of talking to clients as you learn the skill of
2:07:00
selling to more uh different clients you can charge maybe even $500 or even a th000 bucks but then they continue to
2:07:06
pay for the platform themselves $49 per month so it's really up to you which
2:07:11
approach you want to use normally I would just go to the approach of getting the year figure including it in my
2:07:17
starting off price which would be about around $500 plus the yearly figure which
2:07:23
which means that I'm charging about ,000 now depending on your background with website design and also with money some
2:07:30
people might feel like $1,000 is a lot of money like wow can people really pay that isn't that too much I just want to
2:07:37
show you this website which is called Awards um.com as you can see it's Awards with 3ws you can just simply Google it
2:07:44
and this is basically a website that um showcases different amazing website
2:07:49
designs that other designers around the world have actually done and so you can actually check on this website for free if you come here at the top and click on
2:07:56
directory it's going to bring you to the creators Hub where you can actually see different designs that people have
2:08:01
actually done so I'm going to click here on category and then I'm going to scroll down until I get to web design which
2:08:08
that everything that's going to follow under here is website design now I want you to take note that there are 90 991
2:08:14
professional designs waiting in other words these are designs that people have done from different parts of the world
2:08:20
and they' have brought them to this website to be reviewed and so this website normally gives awards for
2:08:25
example the best designed website in whatever industry so 991 professional
2:08:30
websites waiting for review right but if you come here it says quote you'll be able to see how much these people are
2:08:36
actually charging for their website now a website under $5,000 if I click on
2:08:43
$5,000 you'll see here that currently there are 43 people who have submitted
2:08:48
their websites and they waiting 43 out of the 900 that I showed you earlier on and then if I go to websites from
2:08:55
$55,000 to $30,000 us right that's 400
2:09:00
540 professionals who are actually waiting they are charging 5,000 to
2:09:07
$330,000 that's around 540 people so if you think $8,000 is a lot of money for a
2:09:13
website it's not a lot of money it's actually quite cheap it's just a beginner level website where you
2:09:19
charging that amount of money now if I change this and I put it up to 30,000 websites which are over
2:09:27
$30,000 it's $295 what I'm trying to show you is that there are so many people out there who
2:09:33
are actually designing websites and they're charging lots of money for it so you don't have the excuse of saying that
2:09:39
but no I'm just a beginner and people really don't buy expensive websites no just like you are a beginner who is
2:09:45
learning to design websites you also need to learn the art of selling highend
2:09:51
websites or expensive websites now there are basically three categories of websites the first ones are the ones
2:09:57
that we call cheap it's where you're charging anywhere from $0 to $1,000
2:10:03
those are the examples that I gave you earlier on when you're starting out maybe charging $300 plus the monthly
2:10:08
subscription fee and it's very easy to do that since you're going to be using templates and then they just get to pay
2:10:13
you just get that $300 as as a simple fee but as you can see you fall under the cheap category then there's the
2:10:20
$1,000 to $10,000 website these are what we call Professional websites and here you working with various companies yes
2:10:27
you can still be using the templates but then you're going to be making sure that the website is built with an end result
2:10:32
in mind um depending what the client's needs are then there are what we call highend or high quality exclusive design
2:10:40
websites this is where you're charging $10,000 to about $100,000 for those
2:10:45
website those ones really require a lot of detail for example if we go back to that website there and then you see the
2:10:50
top web there that are for about $30,000 and above if you look at this company here area 17 if I just click on their
2:10:58
link here it's going to bring me to their website and show me some of the works that they have done with different
2:11:03
companies and one of the companies that pops up there this one which is called open AI now if you do your research open
2:11:09
AI is a company that's responsible for uh platforms like chat gbt they do lots of AI and this is a billion dollar
2:11:17
company so it makes sense that they are they don't do website for $1,000 but
2:11:23
they are charging $30,000 and above because this is a billion dollar company if you help them to make a billion
2:11:28
dollars they will not struggle to pay you um lots of money then if you also go down you see some of the other uh
2:11:35
websites that they built they build websites for night they've built websites for Balenciaga you can just keep calling down to see the list of
2:11:41
their clients my point here is that in order for you to work with clients like Nike and Balenciaga and open AI it's
2:11:47
something that you need to teach yourself we need to create highend websites and it's a skill that you can
2:11:53
learn right now you might be at the level of just beginner but you can keep upskilling yourself until you get to the
2:11:59
level where you are working with these highend uh designs for these these big companies and so back to the question
2:12:05
that we asked how much should you charge for your Design Services the answer is there is no correct answer to this you
2:12:12
are just going to have to do your research and come up with the figure that makes the most sense to you starting off with the basic amount that
2:12:19
you need to charge for hting the website which should be create HQ and then from there you start choosing how much you're
2:12:24
going to be earning above that but I just want to give you a few guidelines that you can also follow that will help you in your planning the first one is
2:12:30
that you need to set your minimum rate which you are willing to accept so minimum rate is how much does it cost
2:12:35
for the platform to run then number two how much am I willing to charge as a minimum for me it's that $1,000 and then
2:12:41
I can start charging from above that the second thing that you can also do is look at the industry standards you can simply do a Google search and search for
2:12:48
website design agencies or website design comp companies in your area or you can do in a very specific location
2:12:54
for example I just started off by saying near me and then what I'll do is I'm just going to scroll down and see all the different websites and how much
2:13:01
they're actually charging I like this one which is popular which says web design agency web design from 25,000
2:13:07
Rand if I come back to Google and say 25,000 Rand in dollars as you can see
2:13:12
it's $1.3 United States dollars which means that that $1,000 B that I was charging earlier on it's not really
2:13:18
expensive because a lot of other people are also charging that but what you just want to do basically is find maybe 5 to
2:13:24
10 different companies in your area and see how much are they actually charging you can just simply do that by opening
2:13:30
up your cogle like this and then looking at the websites that pop up some of them will write their prices on the websites
2:13:36
some of them you have to request a quote so it makes sense for you to do a bit of research based on your Niche knowing
2:13:42
okay these are the types of websit that I would build in this Niche so that when you're asking them questions like okay I need a code for this typ of website at
2:13:48
least you have got a bit of background also depending on where you want to get your clients the first and easiest way is to get local clients but if you want
2:13:55
to get maybe International clients you can change this to let's say maybe uh London like and you see I'll just click
2:14:00
here it says ageny London and then it's going to show me all the different companies that are in London that actually do website design and then I
2:14:07
can do the same process do my research with them find prices the next thing that you need to consider is how much
2:14:12
work needs to be done now when you're PE you might not understand this but the more you keep getting clients you begin
2:14:18
to see that okay this type of website requires this amount of time and effort therefore I should charge this amount
2:14:24
where is compared to this other website it requires more effort it requires more time so I need to charge way more than I
2:14:30
normally charge but that's just something that you get to know as time goes on the next thing you need to consider is what results are they
2:14:36
expecting if it's simple as results like maybe having an opin form where people can just simply register submit their
2:14:42
email and then they will maybe join a news later that can be something that's very simple and easy to set up but if
2:14:48
they are requiring a website that requires SE own services that might be an extra fee that you need to include
2:14:53
whether you're going to be offering SEO Services yourself or you can actually hire someone else to come on your team
2:14:58
and then you offer it as a full package for more about what results people actually expect from websites make sure that you check out this video right here
2:15:05
that shows you the different problems that websites solve for clients this will help you understand why clients
2:15:11
actually buy websites because people don't buy websites just because they look Nies but they buy them because it's
2:15:16
a very specific result that they're trying to get once you understand what those results are you'll be able to sell
2:15:21
websites for as much as you want the next thing is the complexity of the website is it going to be a simple basic
2:15:27
website that you can take a template from Creator HQ or it's something that you need to recreate in Creator HQ or
2:15:33
maybe you might even need to bring a coder on board you're able to do that in Creator HQ add some new features and
2:15:39
some new things that might not come with the basic standard templates but depending on what the client actually needs you then be able to provide that
2:15:46
you know the other thing also is the client budget you might also want to consider how much are they willing to spend on a website design like recently
2:15:53
I I got a friend who reached out to me and said hey I need a website for something that I'm doing with a new business partner because this person was
2:15:58
my friend I thought no I'll just do them favor I'll just do it nice and cheap I just told them how much the price was and then they told me no this is
2:16:04
actually too cheap my partner actually wants us to invest a lot in the website and then I actually tripled my fee because I got that inside information
2:16:11
that there this was how much their budget actually was so sometimes you just need to get feedback from the client on how much they're willing to
2:16:17
spend for the website before you actually give them a fixed price so no matter what I'll do is someone will ask me how much do you charge for your
2:16:23
website design I know my minimum rate which I'm willing to accept if I'm trying to be cheap I start from about $11,000 if I know that this is like
2:16:30
maybe a soul entrepreneur but then I go on to say that I would need to have a conversation with you further to
2:16:35
understand your business needs so that I can give you a more accurate quote so now this helps me because at least it
2:16:41
shows me if they think $1,000 is too much money I really won't rather wasting my time with them but if they say okay
2:16:47
cool let's talk about it it shows me that okay there's actually room for me to find out more about their business
2:16:52
and then give them a quote further down the line so now in that conversation that I have with them that's where I can also ask them about their client budget
2:16:58
I can ask them a series of questions that will let me know about the complexity what work needs to be done in
2:17:03
the website and then I can then give them a quote based on the information that they give me so definitely you need
2:17:10
to have a conversation with the client and ask them what work they need to do before you can give them a final quote
2:17:16
which will be the amount of money that they're going to be paying so now if you're worried about okay how exactly do I have that conversation with the client
2:17:23
what questions should I ask them what are we going to be talking about check out this video next which will answer
2:17:28
all your questions about how to actually conduct conversations with your potential clients let's talk about the
2:17:34
problems that websites solve for businesses if you don't actually understand the problems that businesses
2:17:40
are facing you'll never be able to sell your websites for more money one of the
2:17:45
biggest challenges that I see a lot of Freelancers or website designers facing is that when they appr Pro clients they
2:17:51
fail to justify the money that they really want to be paid for their websites this is a reason why you find
2:17:57
some website designers on platforms like Fiverr charging as low as $50 and yet
2:18:03
there are other businesses out there that design websites that can charge from about $5,000 in fact the most I've
2:18:09
seen is around $115,000 per website the main difference between highly paid website designers and designers who are
2:18:16
struggling to barely make a living is the problems that they are solving for their clients if you can focus on
2:18:23
creating websites that solve specific problems for clients they'll be willing to pay you as much as you need because
2:18:30
you are helping them solve those problems that help their businesses to grow the question you need to ask yourself as a designer is what's in it
2:18:36
for the client how will they benefit from having this website it's not just about having a nice looking website it's
2:18:43
not just about using the most trendy design not about just having a fast website but the basic Foundation of why
2:18:50
the we it should exist is that it's going to help the business to grow and to make more money for example let's say
2:18:55
you approach a business that makes about 50,000 us per month and they either don't have a a website or they've got a
2:19:03
poor website if you can approach them with a new website strategy that can take their business from 50,000 per
2:19:08
month to let's say for example 250k per month it's not going to be difficult for that business owner to pay you 10K for
2:19:14
your website design as long as you are able to communicate and actually show real proof that this website is going to
2:19:21
increase their sales so the one takeaway that you can take from this video is if you want to earn more as a web designer
2:19:27
you need to teach yourself how to solve big problems big problems that these businesses are facing that you can solve
2:19:33
easily with the website now I'm just going to quickly list out these different problems that you see here on your screen these are different types of
2:19:40
problems that companies face that you can solve as a website designer now this is not a complete list for every single
2:19:47
niche in fact I'm going to show you shortly how you can find the prop s that you can solve as a designer for your
2:19:53
different niches but as you can see these are some of the challenges that companies face for example customers can
2:19:59
find us online right our website actually helps businesses to be found online customers don't understand how we
2:20:04
are different from the next business for example some people might say to you why should I use your website design service
2:20:11
and yet I can go ahead and just use Ai and AI will make a website for me having a clearly defined website can show the
2:20:18
difference and the advantages of working with you as compared to maybe looking for a cheaper freelancer on a freelance
2:20:25
platform or using AI other one is customers don't trust one of the ways that you can build trust for a business
2:20:31
is by actually showing testimonials of previous clients who have been happy with the work and you can put those
2:20:36
testimonials on a website it can be in text form it can be in video form it can be reviews as long as you are showing
2:20:43
things that will help customers to trust that business customers can't buy online from us you need to be able to show and
2:20:49
explain to the business that hey you don't actually have a website there are people who are trying to buy online but
2:20:54
then they can't find you now I'll show you a practical example of this when you are actually reaching out to a client
2:21:00
you can show them proof like this for example let's say that I'm going to be looking for pce control services that
2:21:06
are in my area right someone is going to go to Google and search for p control
2:21:11
near me right then they're going to come to the map section so that they can try and see which company is actually in my
2:21:18
location that I can reach out to now you notice here on the left is going to show you the first few companies that
2:21:23
actually appear and you notice only them have got websites when you're talking to that business owner you can actually
2:21:29
explain to him that your customers this is how they find other businesses online
2:21:34
but then they're failing to find you because your website is not there and now you notice this first one here has
2:21:40
got 53 reviews to show you that these are actually people that are buying from the website online they booking Services
2:21:48
ask the client then how much would know would your business be better if you had got these 53 clients would it be a good
2:21:55
thing or it's a bad thing right this is now real proof that just showing them that people are actually looking for
2:22:01
clients online or looking for businesses online but because they can't find you online they're not doing business with
2:22:07
you now I can go on and on and on and talk more about these points but I I think you see the picture now I'm just
2:22:12
going to leave this list for you you can just take a screenshot of it you can just simply copy it go through it and
2:22:18
ask yourself these questions so that when you're approaching businesses you know what problems you're going to be solving for them directly now an even
2:22:25
better way to approach this using AI itself is to use chat GPT as you know I
2:22:31
talk a lot about chat GPT because it's a great way for us to accelerate what we're doing as website designers it can
2:22:37
help you with your copy it can help you with uh just doing a bit of research so what you can do is that you can just go
2:22:43
to chat gbt and ask something like what are some of the problems that websites help to solve for your Pest Control
2:22:50
company now here where I wrote P control company it depends on what Niche you have chosen you can choose to do work
2:22:57
with real estate companies um fashion industry or you name it whatever your
2:23:03
Niche is just put it in here right what are some of the problems that websites can help to solve for the PES company
2:23:09
your nich there and what should the website include that will help solve
2:23:14
those problems and then I went on to say please list them uh out in a table form
2:23:20
so I'm just going to ask chat gbt to type that out for me and then it's going to give me some of the things that we
2:23:26
already spoke about in the previous list but what I like is that here it goes ahead and makes suggestions for you on
2:23:33
what exactly you need to um set up on the website so as as this just typing
2:23:38
here I'll just look at the first one for example it says low visibility and reach in other words people can find you
2:23:44
online so solution via website increase online presence and accessibility to
2:23:49
potential customers people need to be able to find the business online so that they can
2:23:56
find potential customers how do you do that through S SEO optimization Google my business integration a Blog for
2:24:03
regular content updates etc etc okay next one difficulty in Booking Services
2:24:09
now remember the example I gave you of the pest control some of these people who come looking for pest control
2:24:14
services they're able to make a booking online but because this business owner that we're talking to doesn't have a
2:24:21
booking service people are not able to book right people are going to their competition so a solution or a way that
2:24:28
you need or something that you need to implement on the website is online booking system right appointment
2:24:34
scheduling and a user friendly contact form these are things that you can put
2:24:39
on a website they're simple and easy to just uh set up I'm going to the next one lack of customer trust and credibility
2:24:46
now when we come back to this one remember the first website I showed you here this one has got 53 reviews and
2:24:52
4.9 Stars so if we just click on those Stars they were actually go able to just
2:24:58
go and and click like here it says reviews we're able to get these reviews
2:25:03
like can you see you can just simply copy these reviews I can take a screenshot of this and put it on the
2:25:09
website right so that when people go to the website and they see that these are actual people who have been using this
2:25:15
this website or have been using this company they are more likely to trust that company
2:25:21
so you helping these businesses to get previews online means that people will be able to trust them more and more but
2:25:28
now I think you're getting the picture so this is what you need to do just go and ask CH PT it's going to tell you
2:25:34
about your specific Niche and then you look at the problems that business owners are facing and then you look at
2:25:40
how does my website solve those problems and then those are the things that you're going to be setting up on the
2:25:47
website for the client and then when you go into a meeting with the client to say hey I can build a new website for you
2:25:53
you don't focus more on talking about I will build a new website but you focus more on these are the problems that
2:25:59
you're facing number one number two number three number four number five and I want to help you to solve those problems in fact you can actually have a
2:26:06
whole meeting with the client without actually talking about website design your website design is going to be the
2:26:12
tool you're going to use to solve their problems but you focus more on talking about the problems that they need to be
2:26:19
solved and then they will be willing to pay you the money that you're asking for because you're helping them to solve
2:26:24
problems another great thing that you can also do is the more and more you talk about you more more you talk with
2:26:29
these different clients that's why I keep emphasizing that it's important for you to have a niche the more you talk to these clients you you begin to recognize
2:26:36
that they all say the same thing until you get to a point whereby you now know you're now an expert that when it comes
2:26:42
to this type of Niche these are the challenges that they're always facing and this is what I need to set up on a
2:26:47
website so that they don't have the those problems so when you approach website designed that way you'll always
2:26:53
be able to charge the amount of money that you want remember don't focus on the shiny stuff off it's a fast website
2:27:00
it's a nice looking website Focus only on the value that you will be producing what problems are you going to be
2:27:06
solving how are you going to help the business to make more money how are you going to help the business to get better
2:27:12
you might also be interested in checking out this video right here which will show you how to create your own checklist of things that you need to do
2:27:19
in order to create the perfect website in this video I'm going to show
2:27:25
you how to conduct a strategy call or a sales call with your potential clients
2:27:31
now these calls are very important because they present an opportunity for you to meet up with the client online uh
2:27:37
you present yourself as an expert you ask them different questions so that you can understand the challenges that they're facing in their business and
2:27:44
then you then can pitch your services to them now normally you don't need to do a call if you're charging something like
2:27:50
$100 or $150 those low ticket prices but if you're charging $11,000 or more
2:27:56
normally clients will want to at least know who they're going to be giving their money to they want to kind of
2:28:01
experience you so that they know like and trust you trusting that you are the type of person who actually can help
2:28:07
them to deliver what you are promising so this call is just designed to help you to get that uh opportunity to
2:28:15
present them to them and then pitch to them so um normally I like to start off
2:28:20
with a pre- meting checklist and these are things that you just need to make sure that they are in place firstly Pro
2:28:25
Prospect must be qualified you want to make sure that you're not dealing with $100 clients and yet you're trying to sell $1,000 services and a simple easy
2:28:33
way to make sure that it's done in your call booking page where people actually book a call with you make sure that you
2:28:39
mention something like this is how much your services begin from so that you can get a measure of whether people are
2:28:46
willing to pay that or they're not and in fact I'll talk about it in another future video on how to actually set up
2:28:52
your call booking page another thing is research has been conducted in other words before you get on a call with a
2:28:57
client you actually want to do some research to find out okay what do they do in their business who are their
2:29:02
target clients who are their competitors how are other competitors out there reaching out and getting clients from a
2:29:08
website so that you can have knowledge and understanding look presentable you don't want to get onto a call and then
2:29:14
maybe you were having some peers there are peers in the background maybe you're scruffy dressed you don't have to be
2:29:19
dressed up formally but you just want to be presentable such that your attire or your background doesn't disqualify you
2:29:25
and then have tools to present screenshots in other words you have to be willing to make a presentation like it can be a slide deck can be a Google
2:29:32
Document like I'm using here or anything that just is presentable to for you to present the facts that you're going to
2:29:38
be talking about and then lastly you want to be psyched up you don't want to be boring you don't want to be dead you don't want to sound like you are scared
2:29:45
um even if it's your first time having a client call I'd normally recommend that maybe you practice by yourself first but
2:29:50
make sure that when you get on that call you're actually going to be psyched up then when it comes to the actual call you're going to be going through uh
2:29:56
three different processes the first one is going to be Discovery then the second one is going to be for you to present
2:30:02
and then the third one is going to be for you to close and I'm just going to explain what all these mean um right now
2:30:08
and also just to let you know you'll be able to download this document in the description of this video so don't worry
2:30:14
about taking notes you can actually just get into the document and read directly from the document as I'm going through it so what do we mean when we say
2:30:20
discover you want to start off the conversation firstly by on being on a
2:30:26
light note just maybe giving them an ice breaker normally what I would do is I would ask them okay where are you from
2:30:32
and then I find something nice to talk about like if someone tells me that they're from England I tell them I ask
2:30:37
them oh what's your favorite team my team is Manchester United please don't tell me you support Liverpool just something funny as as a as an ice Breer
2:30:44
so wherever location they are from you can use that as as a as a as a as an IC breaker or find something else but start
2:30:51
off on a light note so that you can show them that you are human you are light-hearted and you're someone fun to
2:30:56
work with and then from there and then here I just give you a couple of different um examples of that from there
2:31:02
I then say something like so I want to start this meeting by learning a bit more about your business I need to understand where you are currently at
2:31:09
and then I can dive into how I can help you so is it okay if I ask you a couple of questions then I wait for them to
2:31:15
respond and say yes then cool then I start asking them questions the point of of these questions is for you to gather
2:31:22
ammunition or to gather um what can I say background into how you can sell
2:31:27
your services so what I mean is like you're going to be asking them these different questions so that you can understand what challenges are they
2:31:33
facing in their business that you can solve by building a website for them so that when you're presenting your website
2:31:39
design Services you're just basically saying okay firstly you mentioned this is the challenge like you are failing
2:31:45
you're not getting people people are not able to find your location because you're not online so we can solve that
2:31:50
by setting up a website blah blah blah blah blah okay so just continue reading through that but then I also give you
2:31:56
like a couple of different examples of some questions that you might want to ask for example can you describe your business and what you do in a few
2:32:03
sentences right they give you that background what are your primary products and services what challenges
2:32:09
are you currently facing in attracting new customers now this is very important because some of the things that we set
2:32:14
up on websites have to do with helping them get new customers so you want to take note of what they currently doing
2:32:20
and what they are currently not doing I'm just turning off something right
2:32:25
here by the side my heater is getting a bit too hot it's quite cold where I'm at right now but yeah basically you're just
2:32:31
going to be going through all these different questions and you don't have to ask all of them you only look for the ones that are most relevant that will
2:32:37
give you a bit more clarity into um them and their business that will just help
2:32:42
you to know how to actually pitch your own um Services okay um are you familiar
2:32:48
with the benefits of a well designed website ask them like to maybe just walk
2:32:53
you through like okay what do they understand about about a website so that you can you gain the level that they're
2:32:58
at another important question I was looking for it here but I can't seem to find it but it's somewhere in here where you ask them okay you having a new
2:33:04
website what does success look like to you what in other words what what are you wishing your website will be able to
2:33:10
help you to achieve then they start listing those things down and then you're just simply there taking notes
2:33:16
these things will help you to know okay this is how I should pach my service then after that you then move on to the
2:33:23
present uh section whereby you're like okay cool uh thanks for answering those questions so just to give you a bit of
2:33:28
feedback on how we tend to work right and then you start going through your
2:33:33
presentation first of all starting off with competitor comparison because you've done your research before you
2:33:39
start showing them that okay I did research on your industry and these are the top competitors in the city while
2:33:44
you're competing with you start going through their websites you start talking about what they're doing well on their websites how they're getting their own
2:33:52
clients and then you're just giving this client insight into some of the things that they should actually be do be doing
2:33:58
in um doing on their own website then you're going to start doing like a comparison like Okay so this this
2:34:05
comparator versus this other competitor these are the different things that they're doing and this is what they can actually do to uh improve make sure that
2:34:12
you're always complimenting first before you just start maybe criticizing that no this website is bad blah blah blah blah
2:34:18
blah talk about like the things that they are doing well that your potential client will also need to
2:34:24
implement right so you're just doing this comparison on all these different competitors and then the law of
2:34:30
authority then you start educating them that okay in order for you to be successful these are the things that you
2:34:35
need to get set up and then you you'll be explaining that from a website design perspective for example you need to
2:34:41
build uh a lead magnet that people can sign up and join your newsletter your newsletter the point of it is not just
2:34:48
to send out people free information but to have people that you can actually uh educate and promote about your products
2:34:54
you need to have like a form where people can enter their contacts and then you can WhatsApp them directly all the
2:34:59
benefits that you're going to be having from a website you're just basically educating the these people and you're doing it in a way that Wows them to a
2:35:07
point where by they feel like man this guy really knows a lot and this guy is the person I really needed to be talking
2:35:13
to if you can like from previous results that you've got maybe from other clients you show them that okay this is what we
2:35:19
were able to do do when we set this up for this client you're just basically wowing them right so now when they wowed
2:35:25
they're like wow and they're excited that wow I didn't know that websites really could do that then you come to the close where like uh do you have any
2:35:32
questions for me at this stage this is very important because excuse me because you want to understand if they' have got
2:35:38
any questions or any challenges or any things that they're thinking about yeah like uh so how does like a newsletter
2:35:43
work then you answer whatever questions that you have it shows that you're knowledgeable and number two you're preparing them for when you tell them
2:35:51
how much it's going to cost they don't have any questions anymore they confident that you're the person who can help them okay then we come to the close
2:35:59
um So based on everything we've discussed do you believe that I understand the issues that you are facing right then you wait for respond
2:36:05
yeah it sounds like you really understand this whole thing do you think that I have the skills to help you solve these issues yeah definitely okay shall
2:36:11
we proceed to The Next Step this is just like a way of transitioning what I would normally say maybe that's a bit shorter
2:36:17
than this is like okay based on everything that we have spoken about um I work with clients who are just like
2:36:23
you and I help them to achieve I mentioned I'll come that I I I help them to achieve would you be interested in
2:36:29
seeing what it would look like to work with me if I was to help you with this I wait for permission they say yes then I
2:36:36
say okay cool then I start explaining okay at my agency this is what we do I just explain that okay this is the
2:36:41
service that we offer and then these are the results that we get and then I go on to mention the price that okay so our
2:36:48
service cost and I mentioned the cost let's say maybe I said that it's going to cost us $3,500 to be able to build
2:36:55
your website like this once I've said that I just keep quiet right I go quiet
2:37:00
and then I look at them and I wait for a response why is this important because
2:37:06
you want to be first of all confident in the price that you are offering your clients number two you want to wait and
2:37:13
see their response are they okay with paying that or are they the people who
2:37:18
are going to start complaining about the price and maybe they're looking for a cheaper price if you allow yourself to
2:37:23
just be quiet and let them respond three things happen number one oh the price is 3.5 okay cool that's good um I was I was
2:37:30
thinking it's going to cost a bit more it tells you that next time you need to increase your prices but anyway cool you
2:37:35
then can immediately sign them up for that 3.5 and hey you now got your client number two maybe they start saying um
2:37:43
okay um okay well I'll think about it and then I'll get back to you normally
2:37:48
when someone says I'll think about it and I'll get back to you it's not necessarily that they don't have the money sometimes it's because you did not
2:37:54
clarify enough on something so they've got some questions in their mind or
2:38:00
they've got some objections that you need to handle in fact I'm going to do another video very soon uh and I'll and
2:38:05
I'll and I'll just put it up here um when it's now ready but it's going to be about how to handle the different
2:38:11
objections that people have so you need to then figure out okay well you're saying that you are going to get back to
2:38:16
me later is there a question that you might have because as you are thinking about it the only person who can answer
2:38:23
those questions directly is me as I've shown you that I know the stuff very well so this would be the best time for
2:38:28
you to ask then you're just trying to get them to tell you okay what's the real issue what's the real question that
2:38:34
they have in their heads so that you can answer it and then come back to okay so are you ready to proceed with the
2:38:40
3.5 and then we move forward okay then the third type of response that you might get is they might openly tell you
2:38:46
that hey man that's just very expensive and a kind of afford it there are two ways that you can approach this number
2:38:52
one you can just end the call and say no that's fine no problem um wish you all the best or maybe refer them to someone
2:38:57
else who might be cheaper or something that's option one number two option two might be okay you saying that it's a bit
2:39:04
pricey um is it because you don't have the money up front to pay it like that
2:39:09
what about if we broke it down into different payment installments you keep quiet and let them
2:39:15
respond okay yeah that sounds better uh what do you have in mind okay cool we've got we've got two options we've got two
2:39:22
options of um you can pay half down now and then the other half after uh a month
2:39:28
or we can do three payments and this is how much you're going to pay first then
2:39:33
second and then third month then we paid over three months but because it's over three months the price is going to be slightly a bit above you understand what
2:39:40
I'm talking about like then you just increase it a bit but dividing it by three wait for the response if they are
2:39:47
happy with one of those options you immediately take pay payment and then they go if they're still negotiating on those different payments they want you
2:39:53
to bring it down you know that definitely okay that's not the best client for you to uh work with at that
2:39:58
time but yes we'll talk about more about pricing and stuff like that in other future uh videos so then if now the
2:40:04
President says okay cool let's get on with it I am ready what I normally recommend that you do is that you on
2:40:10
that call you then send them either the invoice directly on the call or the link
2:40:15
depend on whatever payment processor you're going to be using and they make the payment right there there or the call why is it that important because
2:40:22
sometimes people get distracted if they say okay I'll make the payment later you might have to wait two or three days and
2:40:27
send them a reminder then something has come up and then hey by that time maybe someone else has reached out to them and offered them the same service at a
2:40:33
cheaper price so sometimes it's good for you just say that okay cool do you mind if I just send you the invoice now then we do it uh so that I can also be able
2:40:40
to send you the email immediately with all the stuff that I would need to get started right just say it in a way that
2:40:46
makes them understand that okay this is a bit urgent we can do it now don't try and force it but if you can get them to
2:40:53
sign up now you do it so in other words that means that you need to be prepared what's the payment provider you're going
2:40:59
to be using uh what's uh or is it invoices how are you going to be doing that it be preferably you just send them
2:41:06
a link they click on it they enter their details payment is made and it's just
2:41:11
done simple as that and that's what we call the onboarding process which I'm also going to talk about in a future
2:41:16
video so just make sure that you look out for that some things that you need to consider and look into when you're
2:41:22
preparing for this call know which tools you need to use the first one is zoom or Google Meetup these are tools that you
2:41:29
can use for video calls avoid using the the phone directly because firstly it can be very costly but secondly you want
2:41:35
people to have the experience of actually looking at you and talking to you right it's easier to sell on a video
2:41:40
call than it is on a direct call where they can't see you right when you see each other directly it's just by far
2:41:46
better number two um PowerPoint or Google Sheets in other words just something that you can use for
2:41:52
presenting you can actually create a nice presentation save it as a PDF and just be going through it like I'm just
2:41:58
doing here I'm just using the Google Doc you can use a PowerPoint it doesn't matter but just make sure that the presentation looks good have a pen and
2:42:05
paper to take notes by the side and then behavioral recommendations don't speak monotone monotone means that you sound
2:42:11
boring you sound like you really don't want to be here like you are scared don't talk like that uh use hand
2:42:18
gestures when you speaking right normal human beings talk like this robots talk like this you don't see any expression
2:42:24
and they just talk directly like this don't be a robot right speak with passion and really listen to your
2:42:30
potential customer in other words as much as sometimes website design can get boring be excited about it be excited
2:42:38
about their business wow you're running a pet store wow that's so cool like ah one of my favorite puppies is that blah
2:42:43
blah blah but I don't really know much about puppies maybe you can tell me more about it later on and maybe I could become a customer who knows But be sure
2:42:49
that you are actually passionate about this thing that you're talking about your website design services and the
2:42:55
service that they are actually offering and the last one is smile and have fun with it make sure that this is something
2:43:02
that you actually enjoy doing look at this business as a as a game right you know when you're playing games you're
2:43:07
not angry you're not serious or you're having fun enjoying it right so treat it like a game smile half fun with it enjoy
2:43:14
the conversation um think of it like going on a date right you are you are
2:43:19
you are there to enjoy the food right and also enjoy the person that you're maybe just meeting for the first time
2:43:24
have fun with it and you find that that way you get better results if you've got any questions let me know in the comment
2:43:31
section below but also look look out for the next videos that are also going to help you more with website design see
2:43:37

------



welcome in this course you will learn how to design beautiful and functional websites and not only that I will teach
0:06
you how to make good money working from home and this course is very comprehensive and very extensive but you
0:12
will start with the basics and as you gain confidence you will move into more advanced topics this course is organized
0:18
into modules lessons and subl lessons to make it easy for you to follow along and you don't need any previous experience
0:25
in web design and you don't need to be considered a creative person because I
0:30
will make sure to teach you everything you need in order to become a successful web designer the story about how I
0:36
started this course is very very organic and it's because my younger brother wanted to become a software engineer but
0:42
then he wanted to switch and he wanted to become a web designer and then he came to me and asked me uh which course
0:49
or which training should he take in order for him to become a web designer right and I was like I don't know
0:55
because when I started back in 2004 there weren't a lot of course es and a lot of resources so I had to learn by
1:02
myself and asking people and just trying different stuff and I didn't have any money anyways I was in high school you
1:08
know what I mean and my brother was in the same position when he started and I started giving him some advice and then
1:15
he started to see some success and I was like wait a second probably there are more people like him with no money a lot
1:22
of potential and they just need some guidance so that's why I decided to offer this course totally for free and
1:30
this is not a crash course this is a complete course and I could be selling it for thousands but I'm not going to do
1:36
that because I know that a lot of beginners are broke just like I was when I started and I believe in free high
1:42
quality education I hope you are ready to start learning and yeah let's dive in
1:48
so these are the only tools you need to get started a computer internet connection and then figma figma is the
1:55
software that we are going to use to design our websites so let's start with some
2:01
Industry facts the web design Market is a $4.8 billion industry it's huge there
2:08
is a lot of opportunities for web designers and the market is continuing to grow I just wanted to show you this so you can have some perspective on how
2:15
big this Market is and here is what I'm offering you a complete highquality course for free the
2:23
opportunity to become a member of a collective of web designers for free and access to mentorship for free
2:31
and you might be asking okay so how is this course free what's the catch right the truth is that there is no catch and
2:38
I will explain you why right now so this is me it doesn't look like me but you
2:43
get the point I started freelancing and then I started making money and then I
2:49
started making more money more projects came in and I was making a lot of money but there is a problem we only have 24
2:56
hours a day and it gets overwhelming when you have more than one project going on so I was thinking like what if
3:02
I had a network of hundreds of high level web designers to whom I could pass
3:07
projects when I'm busy and they could pass projects to me when I have like a slow month and that's a win-win
3:13
situation and then I thought what if this network expends 2 thousands and some of these individuals become my
3:19
students and then go on to lead agencies or secure tab design positions at companies like Nike or apple they will
3:26
likely remember who helped them get started and this Insight led me to a decision teaching for free would be the
3:32
best and most effective way to build this best network and it's also very fulfilling for me because it ensures
3:39
that anyone around the world regardless of their location or financial situation
3:44
can access high quality education as long as they have a computer and an internet
3:50
connection before we begin with the course I would like to address something as many of you know the design industry

6:18
foundation of success cultivating the right mindset I know that right now you are probably very excited and you want
6:24
to start designing websites and you want to start making money but first you have to understand that your found has to be
6:30
strong because if not it's going to be very difficult for you to be successful if you are building a house and it
6:35
doesn't have a strong base it doesn't matter how nice it looks is not going to stand on that's why having the right

7:40
to webdesigners collective.com or click the link in the description so let's talk about lesson number one the light
7:47
of creativity and this one is very important because at the end of the day
7:52
there is a lot of people that think that they are not creative right you talk with people and they be like hey I just
7:58
cannot design website because I'm not a creative person I don't know how to paint because I'm not a creative person
8:04
and I like I think that is a misconception because I really believe that all human beings are creative right
8:11
and if you ever solved a problem in your life you have been a creative person because there is no way you can solve a
8:17
problem unless you use your brain in new and unique ways in order to solve it
8:23
that's what you have to do right and that's creativity ladies and gentlemen and that's what designing is all about
8:28
solving problems helping the user achieve a desired outcome and you should try to be like a sponge you should try
8:34
to absorb all different types of information Visual and nonvisual in order to stay creative right and in
8:41
module number three when we start designing our Pro website I will list all the sources and all the websites I
8:47
use to find inspiration there is a very nice quote by Pablo Picasso and it says
8:53
all people are born with the same potential to be creative but many people waste their creativity on too many
8:59
different things I use all my creativity for just one thing my art and that's a beautiful quote by one of the most
9:05
creative persons in history and he was an artist right so he could have said
9:11
something like man I'm just special and I'm you know not everybody's creative you know what I mean and this and that
9:17
but no he said everybody has the same creative potential you know what I mean so that's a very nice thing to to you
9:23
know to think about because that's true even though our potential is uh is infinite the way we express our
9:31
creativity is different now I will talk about the different creativity myths because there are some misconceptions
9:37
about what creativity is the myth number one is this one creativity is an inborn
9:42
Talent exclusive to some people only and the reality is that while some people might be naturally inclined towards
9:48
creative thinking creativity is more a skill than an inborn talent and it can be developed and enhanced through
9:55
practice exposure and education you know what I mean like education is very important and because at the end of the
10:00
day you have to learn new ways to find inspiration and all that stuff that you are going to learn in this course and
10:07
then everyone has the potential to be creative in the unique ways as I said before everybody's different and people
10:13
follow different Paths of creativity and now we have myth number two creativity only belongs to the Arts and that's not
10:21
true you know what I mean because creativity can be found everywhere you know in sports science business and in
10:29
daily life like as I said before when you solve a problem you are a creative person so we should just end that
10:36
misconception of you know like the creative is the artist that is making a masterpiece and you know painting and
10:43
doing sculpture that's not true you know the everyday person is a creative person
10:49
so let's talk about myth number three and this one is very funny creativity thrives on chaos and we have the you
10:55
know the image of the creative person living in a very apartment and you know being a little bit crazy and all that
11:02
stuff and that's not true you know what I mean there is a lot of successful creatives that have a structur life you
11:08
know with your routines and habits and all that stuff and you know for example for web designers I like to keep my desk
11:16
very clean and everything very organized because if not I cannot work and you know as I said I'm a creative person and
11:23
you are a creative person so you know you don't have to be like living in a messy apartment so look around and if
11:31
your apartment or your desk is a mess go and you know clean it up you know what I
11:37
mean because you will be able to focus you know what I'm saying when we when we are in a clean environment we are able
11:43
to focus so so yeah so just do that make sure to clean up everything myth number four creativity
11:50
comes from inspiration alone and you know some people just wait for inspiration they be like man I'm not
11:56
inspired so therefore I'm not going to work and and that's a big mistake you know what I'm saying inspiration comes
12:02
from action too so while you are working you might find inspiration so don't just wait for inspiration to come because
12:10
that's going to make you lose a lot of time and you are not going to be productive so just let it flow and keep
12:16
working myth number five creativity is spontaneous and unpredictable a lot of people think that creativity is
12:22
something magic and very spontaneous that just pops up and that's not true because creativity can be cultivated
12:28
through meditation research and work so there are many different ways to cultivate creativity so this is the last
12:35
one myth number six more ideas mean better creativity and there are a lot of people that think that having a lot of
12:42
ideas means that they are more creative and that's not true because having a lot of ideas doesn't mean that those ideas
12:48
are good enough right so it's better to have only one idea that is a big and a useful idea than having like 10,000
12:55
useless ideas there is a very famous quote by Bruce Lee and he said I fear
13:00
not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times and
13:08
that's a very nice metaphor because more doesn't necessarily mean better the goal
13:13
of this module is for you to understand that creativity is not something that unique right because everybody's
13:20
creative and I want you to have that that mindset and that idea deep uh in
13:26
your head because I don't want you to be limited right I want you to understand
13:31
that you can accomplish amazing amazing results and then you can be an amazing web
13:37
designer in this lesson you've learned about the concept of why everybody's creative and also the main myths about
13:43
creativity now let's move to the next lesson the growth mindset so what is mindset we hear this word every day
13:50
right mindset this mindset that a mindset is a set of attitudes or beliefs
13:56
that someone has there is a psychology is called Carol D who introduced the idea of two main mindsets fixed and
14:04
growth and this concept of fixed and growth mindset is something we see every day some people think they cannot
14:10
accomplish something because they put limiting beliefs into themselves and they keep making excuses on why they are
14:16
not successful they be like oh probably I'm not successful because I'm not creative or I don't have the resources
14:22
you know they just keep making excuses on the other hand there are people who believe in themselves and
14:28
believe they can make it in life no matter what those are the people who have the growth mindset and I want to
14:34
make sure that you belong to the second group so a person that has a fixed mindset is somebody who avoids
14:41
challenges somebody that somebody who gives up very easily somebody who sees effort as something pointless if there
14:48
is not immediate success somebody who ignores or rejects feedback and somebody
14:53
who is intimidated by other success on the other hand uh a person with a growth mindset is somebody somebody who
14:59
Embraces challenges persists in the face of setbacks sees effort as a path to
15:05
Mastery learns from criticism and is inspired by other success when you see
15:10
all these successful designers and all these people making money you have to think that they are only human beings
15:16
and if they were able to accomplish all that you can do it too so stop thinking
15:21
about you know all these different quick strategies and shortcuts and all that stuff because it's going to take a lot
15:28
of work and a lot of indication but you can make it too there is a very nice quote by Roman
15:33
Emperor Marcus Aurelius and he said do not assume that something is impossible
15:39
just because it's difficult for you if any person can do it you can do it too now I want you to sit and think which
15:46
type of mindset do you have right now are you gravitating more towards a fixed mindset or are you gravitating towards a
15:53
growth mindset if you find yourself with a fixed mindset now it's time to change
15:58
app appy the concepts that you learn from this course and you will soon notice the difference additionally go to
16:04
our private group and share your thoughts our beautiful Community will be there for you you are not alone in this
16:10
journey and today is the best day to make a change so in this lesson you've
16:15
learned about what is mindset and the differences between fixed mindset and a growth mindset now it's time to move to
16:21
the next lesson in this lesson I will talk about two concepts that are present in everybody's life fear and resistance
16:28
fear is an emotional reaction we experience in the facee of perceived threats or dangers it can often hold us
16:34
back from taking action that leads to growth resistance on the other hand is our tendency to avoid change or
16:40
challenge even when part of us desire that change or knows it could be beneficial like how many times you
16:47
didn't do something you knew it was beneficial for you that's resistance
16:52
let's say that you want to learn a new language right and you know that learning that language is very important
16:57
for you and for your career and for you as a human being but then you never do it right that's resistance
17:04
on the other hand let's say that you are scared of spiders right and then you are in uh in a hotel in in Australia and
17:13
then you see a spider and then you freeze that's fear both fear and
17:18
resistance can be subtle yet powerful forces that impact how we make decisions respond to Opportunities and pursue our
17:25
goals they often work together to keep us in our comfort zones and preventing us from reaching our full
17:31
potential so they are like a match made in hell if you will you know they are
17:36
the enemy we will explore why these responses occur and how they can be both a natural protective mechanism and a
17:43
barrier to success I will provide you with strategies to recognize when you are being controlled by fear and
17:49
resistance and practical tools to help you overcome these blocks by understanding and addressing fear and
17:55
resistance you will be better equipped to tackle challenges head on make proactive choices and move towards a
18:02
more empowered and fulfilling life let's break down these barriers together and open up a world of possibilities where
18:08
fear and resistance no longer hold us back this diagram is called the illusion
18:14
of fear it shows three elements you your fears and your potential so let's break
18:19
it down the circle that you see in the middle that's you okay that's you represented as an individual then around
18:24
you is a dash square that says your fears this square is not very big but it's directly around you this shows that
18:31
your fears are close to you and can affect you directly but that's an illusion that's what is dashed right
18:38
it's something that in reality is weak and you are stronger then the largest area is your potential this represents
18:45
everything you can achieve or become so it's huge right if you compare this with your fears your potential is huge and
18:53
that's why I call this diagram the illusion of fear because in reality fear is just like illusion in reality fear is
19:00
something small that you can uh you know destroy if you if you have the willpower
19:06
and the discipline and then use the courage to face your fears so go and do
19:12
something that you're are scared about you know what I mean obviously something safe so let's say that you are scared of rejection okay so go to a cafe and ask
19:19
for a free coffee probably they will reject you right but then you will be stronger because you will be okay they
19:25
rejected me but I'm stronger now because I fa is my fear you know what I mean so fear is just something small and I'm
19:31
bigger that's it here is a powerful quote by the Roman stoic philosopher senica we are more often frightened than
19:38
hurt and we suffer more from imagination than from reality so in this slide we
19:44
are going to discover the limiting force of resistance and here as you can see
19:49
here this this circle is you again and then we see two arrows the blue one and the orange one the blue one goes to your
19:56
goals and this is a long distance right and then we see one that is closer which
20:01
points to your bad habits your doubts and your fears right and this one is short and that's because the closer you
20:09
are to these things the further you are going to be from your goals right and
20:15
the more resistance you will create and that's why it's very important to have good habits you know what I mean and
20:21
then get rid of doubt and then fear you know all those things are distractions
20:26
and you don't want them and you have to make an effort to get rid of resistance
20:33
and fear right and these things are not just going to disappear right you have to take action every day little by
20:39
little and I'm not telling you to you know get rid of your doubts and your fears and your bad habits today right
20:45
but today you have to start to think about making progress and about changing
20:51
because this is going to be very important if you want to become successful in this lesson you've learned
20:56
about the illusion of fear and why fear is something you can overcome and become stronger and also about the limiting
21:02
force of resistance and why it's important to take action to move forward so think about these Concepts and let's
21:08
move to the next lesson in this next lesson we are going to talk about the importance of failure and failure is a
21:17
very wise teacher right because without failure it's very difficult to be to become successful but the thing is like
21:24
there is some people that can achieve success without having any failures and
21:30
that happens that's you know that's something that can happen but then that success is going to be weaker and then
21:35
the the other one we see that is stronger why because it has many failures and the experience that this
21:43
type of success has is way more valuable than the success that doesn't have any
21:48
failures by failing and coming back every time you build resilience so don't
21:54
be scared of failure and I want to clarify when I said say success without failures I'm talking about big failures
22:02
right I'm not talking about like little failures that happen in you know in daily life I'm talking about like a huge
22:08
setback so Embrace failure and let it be your teacher in this lesson you've learned why failure is a great teacher
22:15
and why you shouldn't be scared of failing life has so many ups and downs but we can always learn from our
22:21
failures and mistakes and you know get back on track so think about this and
22:27
let's move to the next level lesson in this lesson we will explore a very important topic setting goals is
22:32
something we can do to get that sense of direction it turns Our Big Ideas into small steps that we can follow without
22:39
goals we might lose our way but with goals we have a clear plan that keep us moving forward even when it's tough so
22:45
there is this concept called smart goals so smart is an acronym that means goals
22:51
that are specific measurable achievable relevant and time Bound for example instead of saying I want to be a better
22:57
web designer a smart goal will be I will complete a web design course by the end of this month this is a smart goal
23:04
because it clearly states what you will do how you measure it make sure it can be done relates to your career and it
23:10
has a deadline so what I like to do is to write three tasks for a single day because if you have a lot of tasks in a
23:16
single day you will get overwhelmed and you will give up because we have limited uh willpower and you get tired and it's
23:22
normal for you to be like man I'm just tired I don't want to do this test so just have three and then one of the
23:28
three tasks has to be an important one a non-negotiable one right that you have to complete no matter what and then the
23:34
other two you complete them once you finish the first one and then if you finish the three task and you have more
23:40
time available and you have the energy you can uh maybe write a fourth task or
23:45
a fifth task but don't try to put a lot of task in a single day because as I
23:51
said you will get overwhelmed and try to plan those tasks the day before ideally
23:57
before you go to sleep and you can use a software like Trello or aana but at the
24:03
beginning you can just use pen and paper every big achievement starts with a small step set your goals make your
24:10
plans and start taking steps towards them and let us know in the private group what your goals are maybe someone
24:16
can help you get there faster in this lesson you've learned why setting goals is important what smart goals are and
24:22
how to stay organized so I hope you start writing down your goals from now on let's move to the next lesson in this
24:28
lesson we are going to talk about discipline discipline is the ability to control your emotions behaviors and Desires in the face of external demands
24:35
it's about making the right decisions even when it's hard discipline is the foundation that allows us to stay focused in our goals pushing through
24:42
challenges and Temptations It's like when you do something that you don't feel like doing but you do it regardless
24:48
because you know it's going to be beneficial for you in the long run for example let's say that you feel lazy
24:53
today and you don't want to go to the gym and you push through and you go to the regardless right so that's
25:00
discipline it's almost impossible to become successful in life if you're are not disciplined right you have to make
25:06
sacrifices and push through even when you don't feel like it being lazy is normal it's a human thing we all feel
25:11
lazy sometimes right some more than others but the key is to understand that success requires pushing beyond that
25:17
laziness so every time you feel lazy remember this and go and do the work and
25:23
remember to rest as well because burnout is a real thing right and you have to make sure that you are pacing you know
25:31
this is uh this is a marathon it's not a Sprint so you have to really be consistent but sometimes you have to
25:37
rest remember success isn't a one-time event is a communative result of disciplined consistent actions over time
25:45
so stay focused now discipline is nothing without consistency right it
25:50
doesn't matter if you are disciplined for only one day success lies at the intersection of discipline and
25:56
consistency when you combine discipline actions with consistent effort you create a powerful force in this
26:02
intersection as you can see here in this diagram is where true sustainable success is born in this lesson you've
26:09
learned about the power of discipline and consistency being discipline is not easy right and the beginning of the
26:15
process can be bitter however the reward over time is very sweet so with that
26:21
let's move to the next lesson this lesson is called emotions and the happiness threshold when I was a
26:27
teenager I notice something very interesting sometimes we get a material item that is highly valued by Society
26:34
like a nice bike or a nice car or another expensive possession or experience right at first we feel very
26:40
thrilled and excited but after a few days when the novelty wears off it becomes just another part of our daily
26:46
routine then we might get something else like a Lego set or have an experience like a walk on the beach and
26:52
surprisingly this Lego set or simple walk on the beach can bring us the same level of excitement and happy happiness
26:58
that we felt when we first got the bike or the car sometimes even more this made
27:04
me realize that there is a happiness thresold and that happiness has a limit
27:09
no matter the cost or perceived value of an item the initial excitement eventually Fades and we return to our
27:17
Baseline level of Happiness understanding this taught me that true lasting happiness doesn't come from material possessions but from even
27:23
simple experiences relationships and personal growth by focusing on what truly matters we can find more
27:29
sustainable sources of joy in life when you start making money as a web designer you will probably get some nice things
27:35
not necessarily useless material stuff but maybe a nice computer to help you with work or a nice vacation with your
27:42
family just be aware that these things can bring you joy and happiness but simple things like a nice walk with a
27:49
friend or ordering in and enjoying a simple dinner with your loved one can bring the same level of excitement and
27:56
happiness it doesn't have to be something expensive money alone will not increase happiness to high level
28:01
sustainably it always Fades and we end up chasing new things make sure that you
28:07
understand that chasing these new experiences or objects will not make you happier in the long run now let's talk
28:12
about emotions throughout your journey as a web designer you will feel a lot of different emotions sometimes you will be
28:19
sad sometimes you will be very happy and sometimes you will just feel tired and burnt out these feelings are normal we
28:26
all feel that way sometimes times but if you really want to enjoy life and your profession you have to build a strong
28:33
mentality and be very disciplined you should always try to maintain the same level of Stillness even when things are
28:39
tough this journey will feel like a roller coaster sometimes but the rewards
28:44
of having a successful career as a web designer and impacting many lives through your designs are well worth it
28:52
in this graph you can see your emotions and your focus you should always try to maintain your focus at the same level
28:59
never get distracted by your emotions listen to your emotions but never act while being emotional because it can
29:06
backfire always maintain your focus in this lesson youve learn why buying
29:11
expensive things is not the best way to be happy and also why it's important to control your emotions in this roller
29:17
coaster call life let's move to the next lesson in this lesson we will talk about
29:22
imposter syndrome so what is imposter syndrome imposter syndrome is when
29:27
people without their skills and they think they are not good enough they often feel like a fraud and fear being
29:32
exposed and some signs of imposter syndrome are thinking success is just luck fear of failure working too hard
29:39
due to insecurities not believing compliments and a self-d doubt that is constant and this can cause emotional
29:46
problems like anxiety stress and low self-esteem it can also cause professional issues like not growing in
29:53
your career avoiding New Opportunities and these feelings are extremely annoying especially when you have so
29:59
much potential and you will probably feel like that sometimes because imagine that you finish this course right and
30:06
then you get a job offer or you know like a project or something and you will feel like man I'm just like uh somebody
30:13
new in this you know what I mean and I don't have experience so you will feel insecure so here are some practical ways
30:19
to overcome this right first acknowledge your feelings it's normal talk about it
30:25
with others second challeng negative thoughts and keep a record of achievements third celebrate success you
30:31
know accept compliments and reward yourself because you deserve it you know what I mean you work hard and you
30:37
accomplish a lot of things so you deserve it and lastly look for support you know go to our community and talk to
30:44
other people because there is a lot of people that have the same challenges you know so it's very important for you to
30:51
stay in touch with them and just talk and brainstorm and because that's the way you will find Solutions talking to
30:56
other people now let's talk about this image the orange circle represents you
31:02
and the blue circle are the different feelings experience when you have imposter syndrome such as self-doubt and
31:07
putting too much importance on what other people think about your failures and accomplishments when you look
31:12
outwards all the time you will always be under the illusion of the impostor syndrome just like fear it's only real
31:18
if you let it be as shown in this image when you let it control your perceptions of reality it's around you and controls
31:24
you in this lesson you've learned what imposter Sy syndrome is and how to overcome it don't let it hold you back
31:31
you are great you are awesome all right so let's move to the next lesson
31:37
overcoming the shiny object syndrome okay let's take a look at this diagram which compar shiny objects to adult
31:43
objects understanding this is crucial for staying focused and achieving our goals first let's talk about shiny
31:50
objects these are new exciting ideas or projects that grab our attention quickly
31:55
they are very attractive but can easily distract us from our main goals shiny objects often come with Market hype
32:02
meaning they are popular or trending and everybody's talking about them so let's say that today you want to be a web
32:08
designer right and then tomorrow you see uh you know on Twitter that there is a trend that everybody's talking about
32:15
real estate and everybody's talking about you know being a real estate agent and all that stuff and then you decide
32:21
that you you know you don't want to be a web designer anymore now you want to
32:26
dedicate all your effort into real estate that's a shiny object right now
32:33
everybody's talking about real estate and then you know you see a lot of people posting screenshots making a lot
32:39
of money so you'll be like man that's probably where you know where I can make a lot of money so I'm just going to
32:45
gravitate towards that and I'm just going to leave all these web design stuff behind me that's the wrong
32:51
approach and you have to be very careful with that because to become successful one of the best ways is to focus on on
32:58
one thing only especially at the beginning you have to make sure that you focus on one thing and then in the
33:04
future when you are successful if you want you can diversify a little right but at the beginning you have to focus
33:09
on one thing only and even when you start diversifying you have to make sure that your effort is not invested in a
33:16
thousand projects that are going nowhere shiny objects are very tempting because
33:21
they give us this false illusion of instant gratification when in reality
33:27
it's not something worthwhile and usually shiny objects are those objects
33:33
that attract us very emotionally you know what I mean like when you see a screenshot for example of a real estate
33:40
agent that says I made a million dollars this year you know very quickly and this and that you are emotionally attracted
33:47
to that outcome right and you and you are man I just want to be a millionaire so maybe real estate is is the way to go
33:55
you know and then you try real estate and you fail and then you'll be like man this is not for me and you switch and
34:03
you go and chase another shiny object and that's a process that is endless and
34:08
it happens to a lot of people so you have to break that Loop and just focus on one thing so now let's talk about the
34:15
other side of the diagram let's talk about the dull objects these are ideas or projects that may seem boring at
34:22
first but are very important for a long-term success and these quot quote objects
34:29
don't seem very exciting initially however they provide long-lasting benefits that continue over time even if
34:34
they aren't immediately satisfying so in conclusion try not to be someone who is always chasing new projects that seem
34:41
exciting and easy this approach can lead you nowhere instead focus on your current projects and be patient by
34:48
dedicating your time and effort to what really matters you can achieve long-term success in this lesson you've learned
34:54
about the pitfalls of shiny object syndrome and what ching renew opportunity can hinder your progress
35:00
remember true success comes from sustain focus and dedication to your current projects resist the urge to switch path
35:06
just because something new appears more enticing or because others seem to be succeeding stay committed stay focused
35:12
and watch your efforts pay off all right so in this next lesson we will talk about the dangers of arrogance and hm um
35:20
arrogance is a very interesting thing and it's very easy for people that make money online to be arrogant like I've
35:26
seen it many times people start making money and then they start thinking they are superior and they look down on
35:33
others and all that stuff and as we are going to see in this diagram it's very dangerous to be like that on the left
35:40
side we have the scenario when things are going well you can see that you are the largest Circle this represents how
35:47
in moments of success arrogance can make us feel like we are the most important right you feel like the king but in
35:54
reality you are the slave of your own success and as we can see here on the right side when things don't go so well
36:01
you will feel small because you depend on your success to feel important and
36:06
then other people will seem larger and more and more important than you you know that's why when you are successful
36:12
you have to treat others well because you never know you might need the help of the people you once look down upon
36:19
and that's probably like the worst feeling ever because you would feel miserable and this is a fact we have
36:26
seen this story many times right and I will give you an example Napoleon he was a brilliant military
36:33
leader and emperor of France Who Rose to power during the French Revolution he
36:38
established a vast Empire across Europe and was on top of the world due to his military success and a strategic
36:45
argument however Napoleon's success led into increasing arrogance and you know how that goes he believed he was
36:51
invincible and he didn't listen to anyone he was like I'm Napoleon bro who are you so he often dismissed the advice
36:57
of his generals and advisers and then he thought he was so cool that he decided to invite Russia in I think it was 1812
37:06
or something and that's a clear example of his arrogance he was living this illusion of grandiosity and everybody
37:12
advised him against that decision due to the Russian winter and logistical challenges but he decided to proceed
37:17
with the campaign anyways obviously the attempt to invite Russia turned into a disaster the French army was decimated
37:24
by the call starvation and Russian attacks these mess defeat marked the beginning of Napoleon's downfall he
37:30
faced more defeat and was eventually forced to abdicate and then after his final defeat the grandio Napoleon was
37:37
exiled to a remote island and obviously his arrogance had alienated many of his
37:42
former allies and Generals the people he had once looked down upon were unwilling
37:47
to help him so he lived the rest of his life in isolation very far from the power and Glory he once enjoyed Napoleon
37:54
story is a powerful example of how arrogant can lead to a fall from greatness despite his remarkable talents
38:02
and achievements his overconfidence and disregard for others advice led to his eventual downfall this historical
38:08
example shows us the importance of humility and respect for others even when you are very successful so let's
38:15
look at this slide right we see two armies one that's arrogant you and in your army and then we see your enemy's
38:22
Army and your enemy is super prepared right and you are not prepared but you are under the impression that you are
38:29
prepared because you see an army of four and you see your army and you are four
38:34
but then the problem is your enemy has prepared very well this battle and you didn't and the thing is that they have a
38:41
hidden support Army right behind this wall and you cannot see them this could
38:46
be a wall or it could be mountains and you don't see them the problem is that if this support
38:53
Army comes into the battle you are lost they will destroy you because they are very prepared and there are a lot of
39:00
people and something very interesting happens since you are very confident you start winning the battle because you
39:07
defeat the first four soldiers and then you start boasting and thinking that you are invincible just like Napoleon then
39:13
all of a sudden something very interesting happens again now the hidden Army comes into the battle and then you
39:20
are you are just destroyed like you are surrounded without any escape and obviously the arrogance Fades now you
39:27
might be asking why is this guy talking about war and battles and all that stuff so here is why imagine you are a
39:34
freelance web designer right now who has successfully completed several projects and then you start believing that you
39:39
can handle any projects with ease no matter the complexity this overconfidence leads you to take on a
39:45
complex project without adequate preparation you accept the challenging project because of your past successes
39:51
then you scheme through the client's requirements thinking you've handled similar task before you don't pay
39:56
attention you rush the process you don't do research and then you start working and you encounter unexpected technical
40:02
challenges and client requests that you didn't anticipate so your initial confidence starts to fade as these
40:08
hidden challenges emerge and obviously the outcome of all this is that the project falls behind schedule due to
40:14
unforeseen problems and then the quality of your work suffers because you didn't prepare adequately then what happened
40:21
next is that the client becomes dissatisfied because of the delays and support quality you struggle to meet the
40:27
Cent Cent's expectations and obviously this can make your relationship with the client worse and you might not get more
40:33
work from them in the future so in conclusion be humble and know that every project can have different challenges
40:39
keep learning new skills and stay updated you should also plan carefully and think about possible problems
40:44
anticipating them is key to deliver amazing work make sure to meditate on this in this lesson you've learned why
40:50
arrogance is double faced and while being overprepared is better than being overconfident we've also explored these
40:57
story of the rise and fall of Napoleon let's move to the next lesson welcome to
41:02
the 11th lesson of this module past present and future in this lesson we will explore the importance of learning
41:09
from past experiences without dwelling on them I will talk about the importance of living in the present to maximize
41:14
opportunities and also how to set meaningful goals for the future we will discuss strategies to balance these
41:20
perspectiv for a proactive and well-rounded approach to life the past is an interesting thing it no longer
41:28
exists and still is a powerful teacher reflecting on the past is okay and even
41:33
necessary but problems arise when we dwell on the past making mistakes is part of Being
41:39
Human you know and everyone makes foolish mistakes sometimes and while mistakes are part of
41:45
life some people get too caught up in them like dwelling on the past and never truly living in the present moment I
41:52
emphasize this because learning to be present is crucial for success I chose to use footage of historical ruins to
41:57
illustrate the concept of not dwelling on the past this ruin symbolize what once existed but no longer serves a
42:03
functional purpose today the ruins remind us that while the past is an important teacher our Focus must remain
42:10
on the present and the future to achieve growth and success this visual analogy helps reinforce the idea that holding on
42:17
to the Past can hinder our progress much like staying among ruins instead of building new structures the past is gone
42:24
but we should use the wisdom gained from it to leave to today and prepare for a better tomorrow there is absolutely no
42:31
point in suffering over something that no longer exists and remember this you are who you are today and you should
42:38
never let your path Define who you are or who you will become in the future accept your mistakes and shortcomings as
42:44
part of human life recognize them but never dwell on them and don't get stuck
42:49
in a loop of pessimistic thoughts due to actions you regret regret is part of Being Human indicating that you seek
42:56
Detachment from your mistakes which is why you feel that way you know you feel regret this feeling is a clear sign that
43:03
you are not defined by your past mistakes make today the day that you start being more present and
43:08
future-minded let's work hard today to live a great life tomorrow while enjoying the journey your past will look
43:15
at you proudly for who you have become so let's look at this diagram we have the past the present and the future and
43:22
then we have the obstacles that separate our present self from our future yourself if you notice there is no
43:28
obstacles between the present and the past and that's because since the past in reality doesn't exist like we cannot
43:35
go back to the past there is you know it doesn't make sense for you know for obstacles to be between the two however
43:42
if we look from the present to the future we can see the obstacles and obviously when we try to go to the
43:48
Future there's going to be different obstacles and challenges and setbacks and that's why we have these walls and
43:54
then what happens is if we are dwelling on the path and we keep our Focus there we will hit those obstacles very badly
44:01
because we are not looking to the front right the same thing if you are driving right and you are focused on your rear
44:06
view mirror you will hit an obstacle like a tree or something or maybe go off track you would miss what's ahead and
44:12
you could crash so it's the same thing if we dwell on the past we might miss out on present opportunities and create
44:19
unnecessary obstacles for ourselves so stay focused on the present that will ensure that you are actively working
44:25
towards a better future avoiding the obstacles that come from being stuck in the past learn from your mistakes
44:31
forgive yourself become a better person and move on in this lesson you learn three important points understanding the
44:38
important of learning from the past recognizing why dwelling on the past is a waste of time and understanding that
44:45
your past doesn't Define who you are learning from past experiences helps us make better decisions in the future
44:52
however focusing too much on past mistakes or regrets prevents us from moving forward so remember you can
44:59
always change and grow welcome to the last lesson of module one in this lesson we will explore the importance of
45:05
forming a good habit structure I will show you a list of habits that you should incorporate in your routine we
45:11
will redefine them and then learn how to refine them over time so you can reach your full potential trust me you don't
45:18
want to miss this lesson so what are habits habits are behaviors or routines that are repeated regularly and tend to
45:25
occur subconsciously and they can be simple as brushing your teeth every morning or as complex as your daily
45:30
workout routine habits are formed through a process known as The Habit Loop the que the routine and the reward
45:37
the Q also known as trigger is the signal that starts the behavior for instance waking up in the morning could
45:42
be the trigger or cue for brushing your teeth the routine is the actual behavior that is performed such as brushing your
45:48
teeth the reward is the benefit you get from the behavior like the feeling of cleanliness in your mouth which makes
45:54
you want to repeat it for example when you start networking that's the queue then you start learing some nice
45:59
projects that's a routine and then you get paid that's a reward so why forming good habit is important good habits
46:05
allow you to perform tasks more efficiently because they become automatic this saves time and mental energy that can be redirected towards
46:12
more complex Tas habits also help in maintaining a structured daily routine which increases productivity for example
46:18
developing a habit of setting daily goals can lead to better time management and more accomplishments additionally
46:24
positive habits like regular exercise health eating and sufficient sleep are
46:29
essential for maintaining physical and mental health and forming good habits is also very important for long-term goals
46:35
because there is a thing that's called Compound Effect and a compound effect is basically when small small actions lead
46:43
to significant results here are some habits that are essential if you want to become successful and stay successful I
46:49
have divided these habits into two groups which you can recognize by looking at the orange circles the first
46:55
group includes two habits that are a must and nonnegotiable for achieving success the first habit inside of the
47:01
group is enough sleep which means getting like eight hours of rest right without enough sleep it's very very very
47:09
difficult to perform well and and and maintain your health and obviously you will not be able to sleep eight hours
47:16
every day because you know life is is not like that sometimes you will sleep less sometimes more but you have to make
47:22
sure that you have enough rest because if not it's going to be very difficult to be consistent and the second habit
47:28
inside of this group is work and I'm talking about deep work I'm not talking about you know working for 10 minutes
47:34
and going to you know social media and scrolling there for like you know another 10 minutes and going back to
47:40
work for 15 minutes I'm talking about at least four hours of deep work obviously you can rest and you can pause a little
47:46
bit but you have to make sure that you are consistent with work you know undistracted work and now let's talk
47:53
about the second group of habits and I didn't want to call this group optional because if you want to be like the very
47:59
best you have to do the things that the very best do right and that means meditating exercising thinking eating
48:06
healthy and reading these are things that a lot of average people don't do so if you want to be above average and be
48:13
extraordinary what you have to do extraordinary things and adopting these habits is extraordinary and I'm not
48:20
asking you to do this for hours right I'm talking about 10 minutes of meditation you know 20 minutes of exercise and then you know thinking for
48:28
20 minutes just sitting and thinking about life and about everything you know what I mean for 20 minutes only and then
48:33
when I say 24 hours of eating healthy that means that you should always try to
48:40
eat healthy you know it doesn't mean that you have to have 20 like 24-hour meals I'm talking about being consistent
48:46
in eating healthy throughout the day and obviously it doesn't matter if once in a while you go and eat a burger right but
48:53
don't be eating junk food every day because that's to be detrimental for your health and you don't have to start
48:59
for example with 10 minutes of meditation you can start with five or even two and then you can try 10 minutes
49:07
of exercise daily and then 5 minutes of thinking and you know try to incorporate
49:12
healthier food into your diet and you know read for 10 minutes you know what I mean just do it you know today start
49:19
today you know do not procrastinate do not postpone anything just start right
49:25
now today and you will see see amazing results over time so to end this lesson
49:30
here are some books I've read that helped me tremendously and I've also made an organized list with all the
49:36
books I recommend these are books I've actually read from start to finish you can find this list in the resource page
49:43
and you can access the resource page by clicking the link in the description in this lesson you learned
49:49
about the nature of habits the concept of the Habit Loop and some essential habits for Success understanding what
49:56
habits R helps us recognize our daily routines The Habit Loop explains how habits form through a cycle of cues
50:03
routines and rewards knowing some essential habits for Success can guide us in developing positive routines that
50:09
contribute to our goals hey congratulations on finishing the first module I hope you've learned a
50:15
new way of thinking and that you start applying everything you've learned today now it's time for you to complete this
50:20
modules exercises to access the exercises just click on the link in the description where it says module one ex
50:26
exer sizes thank you very much for your attention and I will see you in module two welcome to module two in this module
50:34
you will learn about the basics and fundamentals of web design and we will also dive into web development but don't
50:41
worry because we are not going to develop a website right now but you have to understand how web development works
50:47
because throughout your career you will work with a lot of developers and it's important for you to understand what
50:53
they're talking about if you want to be a top web designer you have to know these Concepts the same way a good
50:59
architect has to know how construction works we have to know how web development
51:06
Works let's begin in this module we have eight lessons and here they
51:13
are in this lesson we will dive into the various professional disciplines that play crucial roles in the design and
51:20
development of websites understanding these roles is essential for anyone involved in the creation of user Centric
51:27
websites and applications we will explore the unique contributions of ux designers UI
51:32
designers and web developers and see how their skills and responsibilities intersect to create seamless and
51:38
engaging digital experiences by the end of this lesson you will have a clear understanding of these professional
51:44
roles and how they collaborate to produce high quality digital products this knowledge will enable you to better
51:50
communicate and work with different experts in the field ensuring that your projects are both visually stunning and
51:56
highly functional so what is the difference between ux designer UI designer and web developer a ux or user
52:04
experience designer focuses on the overall feel of the app or website ensuring that it's easy and satisfying
52:10
to use they think about how users will navigate and interact with the system aiming to make the user's Journey as
52:17
smooth as possible ux design is not exclusive to digital products to give you a real life example today I was
52:23
walking at the park with my son and saw a very convenient ramp for strollers
52:28
next to the stairs that's good ux because I as the user had a very good
52:34
experience a UI or user interface designer is someone who focuses on how
52:40
apps and websites look they design the visual elements like buttons text and
52:45
images ensuring that everything is visually appealing and styled consistently just like ux UI design is
52:52
also not limited to digital interfaces for example consider the layout and
52:57
signage of a large conference or event a UI designer working on an event will
53:03
focus on creating clear visually appealing signage and informational displays they would design way finding
53:09
signs sched RS and interactive kiosk that help attendees navigate the event space find sessions and access
53:16
information easily this involves choosing appropriate colors fonts and symbols to ensure that information is
53:23
quickly understood enhancing the overall experience for for event participants so
53:29
every time you go to a event or a conference just look around and everything you see an experience that
53:36
was designed by ux and UI designers not web designers obviously but I'm talking
53:41
about people that are dedicated to make sure that the experience for the
53:47
attendees in this case is amazing and digital ux and U are designers do the
53:52
same thing but instead of doing it uh in the physical world they do it digitally a web developer is someone who builds
53:59
websites they turn the design ideas into a website that works they make sure that
54:04
everything that you do you know on the website like clicking buttons or entering information works properly so
54:11
what is a web designer a web designer often integrates elements from all three disciplines you know we need to have a
54:18
good grasp of ux principles UI design skills and basic understanding of web
54:24
development this combination allows us to create comprehensive and functional websites that look great and provide an
54:31
excellent user experience and to be clear you don't have to be an expert web developer but you'll have an edge over
54:38
other designers if you understand the fundamentals of web development if you notice I added this small circle here
54:45
because I want you to see and understand that most of your focus should go to ux and UI development is a small part of
54:52
what you should focus on but it's still important in this course you will learn the basics of web development and by
54:59
joining our private Community you will gain access to more Advanced Techniques so join us today if you haven't already
55:05
you will also discover the power of combining Your Design skills and understanding of development with other
55:11
amazing disciplines like branding and copywriting this well-rounded knowledge will enable you to create more effective
55:18
functional and Visually appealing websites making you a more versatile and competitive professional in the field in
55:24
this lesson youve learned about the key differences between ux user experience UI user interface and web development ux
55:31
focuses on the overall field and ease of use of a product UI deals with the
55:37
design and interactive elements users engage with and web development involves the coding and Technical implementation
55:43
of websites hey what's up in this lesson I will explain you what figma is we will install it and I will work you through
55:49
the application so you can understand the basics if you already know how to use figma and you have figma installed
55:54
you can skip this lesson and go to lesson 2.4 that lesson is called understanding the web design principles
56:00
so let's go so what is figma and why it's used for web design figma is a
56:06
cloud-based design tool that is primarily used for interface design including web and mobile applications it
56:12
provides a collaborative environment where multiple users can work on a design simultaneously making it very
56:19
popular among teams for realtime collaboration figma uses vector graphics
56:24
which allows you to create design that can scale infinitely without losing quality this is crucial for creating
56:30
crisp and professional looking designs figma's component system lets you create reusable Design Elements you can create
56:37
a component once and use it across multiple designs ensuring consistency and saving time with figma you can
56:44
create interactive prototypes this means you can simulate how your design will work in real life allowing for better
56:50
user testing and feedback before development begins as I mentioned before figma supports real-time collaboration
56:56
ation which allows multiple team members to work on the same design simultaneously and this is very powerful
57:02
figma supports a variety of plugins that can extend its functionality these plugins can automate repetitive task add
57:09
new Futures and integrate with other tools making your workflow more efficient figma also includes features
57:14
that help you design accessible products you can check contrast ratios and ensure your designs are usable by people with
57:21
disabilities making your designs more inclusive it has a built-in Version Control allowing you to track changes
57:28
and revert back to previous versions of your design AO layout in figma helps you
57:33
create responsive designs that adjust automatically based on the content this is very useful for Designing interfaces
57:39
that need to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations now it's time to install figma and set up your
57:46
account the first thing you have to do is go to figma docomond here where it says get started
57:52
when you click this will pop up and here you can continue with Google if you have a Gmail account or you can add your
57:59
email here and your desired password and click create account after you click create account you will receive a
58:05
verification email that you can find in your inbox and you just have to click the button where it says
58:11
verify after clicking the button that verifies your email you will be taken to this
58:16
screen this is the browser version of figma however we will not be working here because it has some performance
58:22
limitations therefore we will install the desktop version to ensure a smoother and more efficient experience the next
58:29
step is to download and install figma and to do that you have to go to figma docomond and you will see this page now
58:37
choose the version of figma that's right for your operation system click the link to download the installation file if you
58:43
are on Windows find the installer file in your download folder it will be named something like figma setup double click
58:50
this file and start the installation if you are on a Mac it's the same thing go to the download folder and and you will
58:56
see a file named figma DMG or something like that double click to open it after finishing the installation process click
59:03
to open the application log in if you are asked to with the same email and password you use when creating the
59:09
account now we will navigate the figma interface so you can see how everything is structured before we continue please
59:16
pay attention as figma evolves you might notice some features have moved since this recording but don't worry because
59:23
figma provides a detail guide tracking changes with each update the core principles stay the same features are
59:31
just reorganized updated or occasionally replaced you can find any relocated features in figma's official guide which
59:38
I recommend bookmarking for reference here is the URL and I will also leave a link in the description you will adapt
59:45
to user interface changes very quickly and currently if you prefer you can also
59:50
switch back to the old interface by clicking here though this option may not be permanent so so if you don't see this
59:57
option refer to the official guide so this is the first thing you will see this is the figma home dashboard and we
1:00:04
will start by creating a new design file so to do that you just have to navigate here to the top left and then click this
1:00:10
plus sign you will be taken to this page and you have to click on new design file
1:00:16
and this is your first design file and the first thing we will do is change the name of the file we can just navigate
1:00:22
here and then click here and you can name it what ever you want I would just
1:00:30
say inside your figma design file you will see that the interface is divided into four main areas the main toolbar on
1:00:38
the top left the properties panel on the right the canvas in the center and the
1:00:43
layers and Pages panel on the left let's briefly go through these to help you understand how to navigate and use figma
1:00:49
efficiently the main toolbar located on the top left contains essential tools that you'll use frequently while
1:00:55
designing this includes tools for moving objects creating frames drawing shapes adding
1:01:01
text and more the toolbar also houses the resources tool which allows you to
1:01:07
access plugins components and team libraries making it easy to incorporate various assets into your designs in the
1:01:14
center of the interface is the canvas where all your design work happens this
1:01:19
is your main workspace where you place and manipulate elements like shapes text and images you can zoom in and out to
1:01:27
focus on details or get an overview of your entire design making it a flexible
1:01:32
and dynamic area for creativity on the left side you will see the layers panel
1:01:37
this panel displays all the elements in your design in a structured way allowing you to manage and organize your layers
1:01:43
groups and Frames efficiently and don't worry too much about the names and the you know the concepts and all this stuff
1:01:50
because uh in the next module when we start design in our website you will
1:01:55
discover what each of these do above the layers panel is the pages panel and you
1:02:00
have to click here in order to expand the panel this panel helps you manage different pages within your design you
1:02:07
can create new pages rename them reorder them duplicate them or you know delete
1:02:14
pages this feature is especially useful for organizing your work into separate sections or projects on the right side
1:02:20
of the interface is the properties panel which changes dynamically based on the selected object
1:02:26
this panel provides detailed controls for customizing your Design Elements you can adjust positions sizes colors text
1:02:33
Styles and more it also includes options for adding effects and setting up interactions for prototyping in this
1:02:39
lesson you will learn what figma is and why it's use for web design as well as how to install figma and navigate its
1:02:45
interface in this lesson we will go through the essential tools available in figma and explain how each one can be
1:02:51
used effectively in your design process along with practical examples let let's start with the shape tools these tools
1:02:58
include various geometric shapes such as rectangles ellipses polygons and stars
1:03:03
these tools are useful for drawing basic um shapes that serve as building blocks for more complex designs you can combine
1:03:10
customize and manipulate these shapes to create intricate patterns you can also create icons and other Design Elements
1:03:17
let's create a simple shape using the rectangle tool Begin by selecting the rectangle tool from the main toolbar on
1:03:23
the top left of the figma interface now click and drag on the canvas to draw a rectangle aim for a medium siiz
1:03:30
rectangle in the center of your canvas next we will change the field color of the rectangle and to do that click on
1:03:36
the rectangle you just created to select it in the properties panel on the right you will see the Field property right
1:03:43
here click the color box below field to open the Color Picker and then choose a new color for
1:03:50
your rectangle now you can see the new color applied to the rectangle now let's
1:03:55
add and customize the stroke or border of the rectangle in the properties panel find
1:04:01
the stroke section and click the plus icon to add a stroke to the rectangle click on the color box below stroke to
1:04:07
open the Color Picker and choose a contrasting color like orange for example then adjust the stroke width by
1:04:15
entering a value in the width fill right here set the width to six pixels to make it more visible now you can see the
1:04:21
border right here and we can make the Border you know uh
1:04:27
thicker just adding a higher value here for example
1:04:33
40 and we can see how thick it is now you can also customize it let's say that
1:04:38
you want only the bottom right so you click here and you can see or let's say you
1:04:46
want the top you can see or the left
1:04:51
side you see you can also customize the width of each side side
1:04:56
independently by clicking here and then custom and let's say that you want the bottom to be 90 right and the top to be
1:05:06
10 and then the right side to be 20 so you know you can play with
1:05:12
it let's change the Border because this looks very ugly so let's go here and
1:05:18
then click all and then let's change it to 60 like all sides to 60
1:05:27
and here we have it now I will show you some cool stuff you can do with the border to access the advance options
1:05:34
click the rectangle on your canvas and go to the stroke section in the properties panel click the three dots to
1:05:39
open the little panel that contains the advanced stroke settings right here with this option you can change the
1:05:45
stroke style from solid to Dash or custom patterns for example selecting Dash allows you to create Dash Lines by
1:05:52
specifying the length of the dashes and gaps just like this
1:06:02
for more complex patterns choose custom from the stroke style dropdown in the dashes field enter a series of numbers
1:06:09
separated by commas to create a custom Dash pattern each number represents a length of Dash or gap for instance we
1:06:16
have the default here 120 240 360 and 480 and this creates varying Dash
1:06:23
lengths and if you want to change the numbers just click here and you can add any numbers you want in the dash caps
1:06:29
option you will see nonone square and round the nonone option keeps the ends
1:06:35
of each Dash as straight cuts like this Square extends the ends of each
1:06:42
Dash to form Square edges like this and then round rounds off the ends
1:06:48
of each Dash like this now let's talk about the joint option this setting controls how Corners
1:06:55
are render where two lines meet the options are miter sharp Corners bevel
1:07:01
flatten corners and round round the corners adjusting this affects the
1:07:06
appearance of the corners in your shape and this is how this looks this is miter
1:07:13
this is vevel and this is round if you select the miter option you can specify the
1:07:20
miter angle which determines how sharp the coordinate should be before it bevels off this is is useful for
1:07:26
controlling the sharpness of angles in your design the miter angle option is very confusing but don't worry I will
1:07:32
explain you how it works the miter angle and bevel options in figma both address how Corners are rendered but they serve
1:07:39
slightly different purposes and offer different levels of control the miter angle setting allows for more granal
1:07:45
control over when a corner should switch from miter joint a sharp corner to a bevel joint flat corner for example if
1:07:53
you set the miter angle to 90° and any corner with an angle of 90° or less will
1:07:58
be beveled while any angle greater than 90° will remain a sharp point and this
1:08:04
is useful for designs with varying angles where you want to maintain sharp Corners above a certain degree while
1:08:10
beveling sharper angles to prevent overly pointy edges the bevel option on the other hand uniformly applies a bevel
1:08:17
corner to all angles in the shape this is a you know simpler and quicker solution if you want all Corners to be
1:08:24
beveled without considering their individual angles it ensures consistency across all corners and is easier to
1:08:30
apply when you don't need the conditional control offered by the miter angle the mitor angle though gives you
1:08:36
the flexibility to control which Corners are beveled based on how sharp they are this is particularly useful in complex
1:08:43
designs where maintaining sharp corners for some angles and beveling others is desirable like in this custom shape I'm
1:08:50
showing you right now so in a nutshell the miter angle is best for detail control over specific corner angles like
1:08:57
this while the bevel option is ideal for quickly applying a uniform bevel effect
1:09:02
across all Corners ensuring a simple and consistent look without additional
1:09:08
adjustments by understanding and utilizing this settings you can enhance the Precision and Aesthetics of your
1:09:14
designs in figma um feel free to experiment with these settings to see how they affect the look and feel of
1:09:21
your designs if you have any questions about this or anything else you can send me a DM in the private group or you can
1:09:27
ask in the comments if you are watching this on YouTube before I forget let's quickly explore the stroke's position
1:09:34
you can choose whether you want the stroke inside Center or outside and it offers practical benefits in design for
1:09:41
instance if you are creating a button placing the stroke inside ensures the button size remains unchanged fitting
1:09:47
perfectly within a layout just as you can see right now centering the stroke places half of the stroke inside and
1:09:52
half outside the boundary which slightly increases the buttons overall dimensions and then positioning the stroke outside
1:09:59
enlarges the buttons total size and clickable area just like this uh this flexibility helps achieve precise and
1:10:05
functional design outcomes finally we will add some effects to the rectangle to enhance its parents in the properties
1:10:13
panel find the effect section and click the plus icon to add an effect the first
1:10:18
effect added by default is a drop shadow adjust the setting for the drop shadow by setting the opacity to 50% blur to 10
1:10:26
and both X and Y offsets to five just like
1:10:32
this this settings will give the rectangle a subtle Shadow effect making it look more three-dimensional there are
1:10:38
other cool and simple features like adding a gradient color an image or even a video feel free to explore these
1:10:45
options at your own pace now let's talk about the move tool this tool is the default tool in figma
1:10:52
represented by a cursor icon it allows you to select move and resize objects
1:10:58
easily to select objects click on the Move tool or press V on your keyboard click on any object to select it if you
1:11:05
want to select multiple objects uh hold the shift key and click on each
1:11:10
object moving objects is very simple click and hold on a selected object then
1:11:16
drag it to a new position on the canvas just like this this makes rearranging elements
1:11:23
quick and intuitive sizing objects is used as straightforward click on an object to select it then drag the small
1:11:30
handles that appear around the object to adjust its size just like
1:11:36
this you can also group objects and that helps to keep your design organized
1:11:41
select multiple objects by holding shift and clicking on them then right click on
1:11:46
the selection and choose group selection or you can also press contrl G or command G if you are on a
1:11:53
Mac you can also line objects and to do that select the objects you want to align and use the alignment options in
1:11:59
the properties panel to adjust their positions understanding and using the move tool effectively is essential for
1:12:06
arranging elements in your design mastering this tool will improve your efficiency making it easier to quickly
1:12:12
adjust layers and align objects Okay cool so you've learned how to create a shape change its color and
1:12:19
add effects in figma these basic skills are essential for creating visually appealing designs practice I these
1:12:25
techniques to become more comfortable with Figo and enhance your design projects all right so now let's talk
1:12:31
about frames frames in Figo are fundamental elements used to create layouts and organize your design they
1:12:37
act as containers for objects like shapes text and images understanding and
1:12:42
using frames efficiently is crucial for Designing inigma and basically every time you
1:12:48
design a website in figma you will be using frames as containers instead of shapes and that's because with frames
1:12:55
you can apply different features like Auto layout nested frames layout grids and more but don't worry about this
1:13:01
right now I will explain them more in detail later in the course for now let's create a frame to create a frame start
1:13:07
by selecting the frame tool in the tool bar on the top left right here next click and drag on the canvas to create a
1:13:14
frame of the desired size you can also use the predefined device screen sizes also here in the properties
1:13:21
panel okay so now I will show you how to resize and then adjust frames to resize
1:13:27
click on the frame to select it then drag any of the handles on the corners holding the shift key while dragging
1:13:33
will maintain the aspect ratio to adjust the position click and drag the frame to move it to a different location on the
1:13:40
canvas you can also use the arrow key on your keyboard for precise adjustments now let's add some content
1:13:47
inside of the frame frames can hold various types of content such as shapes text and images to add shape select the
1:13:55
shape tool from the toolbar choose a shape like a circle for example and draw it inside the
1:14:01
frame just like this to add text select the text tool from the toolbar or press
1:14:07
T then click inside the frame and start typing to add images drag and drop an
1:14:15
image file from your computer directly into the frame or use the um Place image
1:14:20
option from the menu you can also copy and paste inside the frame
1:14:25
just make sure that the frame is selected because if not the element will be placed outside of the frame and that
1:14:31
can cause a lot of confusion when you start editing and organizing the content now let's talk about nested frames and
1:14:38
pay special attention to this because you will be using this a lot okay so frames can be nested within each other
1:14:43
to create complex layouts to create a parent frame we will press F and drag
1:14:49
and this will be the parent frame uh I will change each color so you can better visualize the hierarchy to
1:14:57
add child frames create additional frames inside the parent frame by drawing new frames within each
1:15:02
boundaries these child frames can hold their own content and child frames inside of them and be independently
1:15:08
adjusted um I hope this is not too confusing because as I said before you will be using this a lot and if you have
1:15:14
any questions and you are watching this on YouTube you can leave a comment and I will do my best to answer and if you
1:15:22
want you can also send me a DM in the private group now let's talk about aligning and distributing elements to
1:15:27
align an object you select the object within the frame and use the alignment buttons in the properties panel right
1:15:33
here and with this you can position the selected object you can also manually
1:15:38
align objects by dragging them to the desire location however manually aligning multiple objects can be timec
1:15:45
consuming and be prone to errors leading to misalign elements and potential overlap there are other ways to align
1:15:51
multiple objects as well and you can do it by using the Align buttons in the properties panel right here this aligns
1:15:58
the objects relative to each other or the frame while this method is quicker than manual alignment it can still
1:16:04
result in overlapping objects if they are not initially grouped to distribute objects you select multiple objects and
1:16:10
use the distribution buttons in the properties panel found right here to evenly space them horizontally or
1:16:16
vertically within the frame this ensures that the spaces between the objects are equal a better way to align and
1:16:22
distribute objects is with auto layout Auto layout in figma automatically adjust the position of elements within a
1:16:28
frame based on predefined rules it ensures that objects are properly aligned in space preventing overlap and
1:16:35
maintaining a consistent layout and don't worry too much about Auto layout right now because I want to
1:16:40
make sure that you understand it well since it's a very powerful tool it can
1:16:46
be a little bit confusing to understand in the beginning but once you grasp how it works you will love it and use it
1:16:51
very often we will go more in detail later in the course for now I just want you to get familiar with the name frames
1:16:57
are a versatile and essential part of figma that help you organize your design by mastering frames you can create clean
1:17:04
and organized layouts practice these steps and you will become more proficient in using frames in no time
1:17:09
and always feel free to experiment and explore more advanced features as you become more comfortable with the basics
1:17:15
and to solidify your understanding you will have some exercises at the end of this module this will help you practice
1:17:21
and really Master the use of frames and shapes in figma keep it experimenting and soon you will be creating
1:17:26
sophisticated designs with these let's move to the next topic now we will explore how to add and format text and
1:17:33
images in figma let's break down the process into simple steps for both text and
1:17:39
images to add text select the text tool from the toolbar on the top left or press the T key on your keyboard click
1:17:47
anywhere on the canvas and start typing to create a text layer for formatting
1:17:52
text you can choose your desire Fone from the the text section in the properties panel on the right right here
1:17:58
here you can change the font the size the style the space between lines letters and you can also set the
1:18:05
alignment there are also some extra settings you can access by clicking on the three dots right
1:18:11
here now let's talk a little bit about images to add an image you can drag and
1:18:16
drop an image from your computer directly onto the figma canvas you could also use the place image option from the
1:18:23
file menu right here then select the image file you want to insert now let's say you want to resize
1:18:30
the image right to do that click on the image and drag the corners while holding the shift key to resize it while
1:18:36
maintaining its aspect ratio just like I'm doing right now you can also further customize the
1:18:44
image by selecting the image and then going to the Field section in the properties panel here on the right
1:18:51
side and then you can click here and you will see this uh this panel pop up right
1:18:58
and here you can craft the image you can also change the exposure the contrast the saturation you can rotate the image
1:19:06
so there is a lot of things you can do U feel free to explore and try different settings you can also use shapes to mask
1:19:12
your images this is a very cool feature actually and it's very easy to do first
1:19:18
draw the shape you want to use as mask then place the image you want to mask on top of it like this
1:19:25
next drag the cursor to select both the shape and the image and now right click
1:19:30
and choose use as mask from the menu or you can also click the mask icon in the TP toolbar right
1:19:37
here and you have to pay attention because if the image is behind the shape it won't work uh this is what would
1:19:45
happen to fix this select the image and then right click and then bring to
1:19:52
front and now let's do it again and it
1:19:58
works let's say that you want to resize this image inside what you have to do is Click anywhere inside of the Mask I mean
1:20:04
double click and then go to any corner and then press shift maintain shift and
1:20:11
then drag and that way you can uh resize the image
1:20:17
inside and if you want to resize The Mask you should go to the layest panel
1:20:23
right here and then click the shape in this case the polygon and then go to the shape and uh to any corner and press
1:20:31
shift maintain shift as well and then
1:20:37
drag and if you want to resize the entire shape you can do it by clicking once going to a corner and then pressing
1:20:44
shift maintaining shift and that's it you can resize if you don't uh maintain
1:20:51
shift pressed this is what can happen right it doesn't respect the the ratio
1:20:59
of the image so these are the basics on using image mask in figma and you can do this
1:21:06
with any shape like let's say you want to do it with a star right just like
1:21:11
this or maybe a circle like this so it's very nice and here are some
1:21:19
other things you can do with images you can also add a stroke to images
1:21:25
here in the properties panel and you can also add different effects like a drop
1:21:31
shadow and you can also change the corner radius here in the properties panel as well you can also change the
1:21:38
size right here now that you know the basics about text and images let's move to the next
1:21:46
topic all right so let's dive into figma plugins plugins extend the functionality
1:21:52
of figma helping you automate task integrate with other tools and enhance your design workflow let's break down
1:21:59
the essentials of using plugins in figma figma plugins are third party
1:22:05
tools that you can install to add new features or streamline your workflow they are developed by both figma and the
1:22:12
figma design Community covering a wide range of functionalities from design automation to content generation to
1:22:18
access the plug-in Library you can do so by clicking the resources icon on the top left toolbar or simply by right
1:22:25
clicking on the canvas and then going to plugins and then manage plugins installing plugins is very easy you just
1:22:31
click here and then search the plugin like unsplash for example and then click
1:22:37
run that's it the unsplash plugin is very useful and it's a plugin that allows you to insert high quality
1:22:44
royalty-free images into your designs directly from unsplash just like
1:22:50
this and if you want to run the plugin again later you can do it by right clicking on the canvas go to plugins and
1:22:57
then click on the plugin you want to run um I've made a list of some essential plugins on the resource page you can
1:23:04
access the resource page by clicking the link in the description and always experiment with different plugins to
1:23:09
find the ones that best suit your workflow and project needs in this lesson you will learn how to use figma
1:23:15
and its tools create frames and shapes add and format Texs and images and the
1:23:21
usefulness of figma plugins by understanding how how to use figas features you can effectively design and
1:23:27
organize your projects in this lesson we will go through a quick overview of the main web
1:23:33
design principles throughout the course you will learn each principle in more detail but right now I want to make sure
1:23:41
that you understand the fundamental concepts of how a website should be designed this lesson will give you a
1:23:48
solid foundation and context for the lessons to come helping you to see the big picture of what makes a website not
1:23:53
only attract ractive but also functional and user friendly so let's get started and explore the key principles that will
1:24:00
guide your web design Journey there are 14 main principles and
1:24:05
we will start with balance balance means arranging elements on a page so that no one part is too
1:24:12
heavy and we have two types of symmetry symmetrical and asymmetrical symmetrical
1:24:17
balance is like a mirror image with elements equally spread on both sides a symmetrical balance uses different
1:24:24
elements on each side but arranges them in a way that still feels balanced and Visually
1:24:30
pleasing so let me give you an example of each right so for symmetrical balance
1:24:35
imagine a web page with two columns on the left there is an image of a product and on the right there is an equal siiz
1:24:42
image of another product below these images there are two blocks of text with descriptions of the products align
1:24:49
perfectly under the image this creates a mirror like effect making the design look formal balanced and for a
1:24:55
symmetrical balance imagine a seaw with a large child on one end and two smaller
1:25:01
children on the other right even though the children are different sizes the Seesaw can still balance on a web page
1:25:08
you might have a large image on one side and several smaller images or blocks of text on the other side the different
1:25:14
elements balance each other out visually the second principle is variety and variety involves using different shapes
1:25:20
colors and sizes to create interest in a design it prevents the design from being too monotonous and keeps the viewer
1:25:27
engaged for example a website for a children's toy store uses a mix of bright colors different fonts and
1:25:34
various playful shapes to keep the design Lively and engaging this variety keeps the user interested and
1:25:40
entertained while browsing the site number three is contrast contrast is about making elements Stand Out by using
1:25:47
differences in color size and shape high contrast makes text easier to read and
1:25:53
important information more noticeable helping to draw the viewer's attention to key parts of the design for example
1:25:59
on a News website headlines are often in a bold black text on a white background
1:26:04
and this high contrast makes the headline stand out and easy to read drawing attention to the most important
1:26:11
information first number four is alignment alignment means lining up elements to keep the design need and
1:26:17
orderly this can be along the edges or in the center ensuring that everything looks well organized and professional
1:26:23
for for example a professional portfolio site might align all text to the left and ensure all images are also aligned
1:26:30
along a common Edge this alignment creates a clean and organized look making the content easier to follow the
1:26:38
fifth principle is movement movement guides the viewer side through the design it helps direct attention to
1:26:43
important areas by creating a visual flow making the design feel Dynamic and engaging for example on a fashion block
1:26:51
movement can be created by arranging elements to guide the reads eye from a
1:26:56
large e catching image at the top down through the content with smaller images and text leading to the call to action
1:27:02
at the bottom the next one is a scale scale refers to the size of elements in relation to each other using different
1:27:09
sizes can show which elements are most important and create a sense of hierarchy in the design for example an architecture studi
1:27:17
website might feature large images of their most important projects on the homepage with smaller images of other
1:27:24
projects below this use of scale highlights the key achievements first while still showcasing additional work
1:27:31
number seven is proportion proportion refers to the relationship between the sizes of different elements it ensures
1:27:38
that all elements look balanced and the design feels cohesive for example on a coffee website a large photo of a
1:27:44
steaming cup of coffee is the main focus with smaller photos showing the steps of the Brewing process this proportion
1:27:51
ensures that the most appealing part of the content which is the cup of coffee stands out number eight is emphasis
1:27:57
emphasis means making a particular element stand out so that it catches the viewer side first this can be done by
1:28:03
using a different color size or shape helping to highlight import and information for example an e-commerce
1:28:09
store can have a product that is on sale and you know when you go to the collections page you would see a lot of
1:28:15
different products but that product that is on sale would have a badge maybe that says uh on sale or something like that
1:28:22
right and that's emphasis because they want to make sure that you notice that that specific product is on
1:28:28
sale Number Nine is hierarchy hierarchy involves arranging elements to show their order of importance this helps
1:28:34
guide the viewer side from the most important to the least important information making the design easy to
1:28:40
understand for example on a black post page the title is usually the largest and most prominent element followed by
1:28:47
the subheadings and then the body text this hierarchy guys the readers's attention from the most important to the
1:28:53
least important information and obviously the body text is very important right but if you don't uh read
1:28:59
the title right and if the title is not interesting you will not proceed to read the body text and that's why this is a
1:29:06
very good example of hierarchy the 10th is rhythm Rhythm creates a sense of
1:29:11
movement through repetition and pattern it helps to create a cohesive look by repeating elements like colors shapes or
1:29:17
lines making the design feel more organized and engaging for example an online magazine might use a repeating
1:29:24
pattern of article previews with images and headlines this repetition creates a rhythm that makes the design feel
1:29:30
cohesive and helps users easily scan through the content number 11 is Unity Unity ensures that all parts of the
1:29:37
design work together harmoniously this makes the design feel consistent and complete with each element complimenting
1:29:43
each other for example a Brand's website uses the same color scheme fonts and design elements across all its Pages
1:29:50
this Unity ensures that all parts of the site feel like they belong together creating a harmonious and professional
1:29:56
look now we have number 12 space space or white space is the empty area around
1:30:01
elements in a design it helps to reduce coloror making the design easier to read and understand and giving elements room
1:30:07
to breathe for example a minimalist design blog uses plenty of white space around images and text this space makes
1:30:14
the content more readable and allows each element to stand out without feeling clutter number 13 repetition
1:30:20
repetition involves using the same elements throughout the design to create consistency this makes the website look
1:30:26
cohesive and helps users recognize patterns improving navigation and user experience for example an e-commerce
1:30:32
site might use the same button style for all add to card actions you know throughout the site and this repetition
1:30:39
helps users recognize uh the action they need to take creating a consistent and
1:30:44
userfriendly experience and now the last one number 14 proximity proximity means placing
1:30:50
related items close to each other this helps to organize information and makes it easier for users to understand that
1:30:56
these items are connected and an example would be on a contact page the form fills for name email and message are
1:31:02
grouped together closely this proximity indicates that these fields are related and should be filled out together making
1:31:08
the form easier to understand and use so that's it now you've discovered the main web design principles and know how to
1:31:15
use them these principles help create visually upine and userfriendly websites by understanding and using
1:31:22
these principles you can improve the layout usability and overall design of your Web projects making them more
1:31:28
effective and engaging for the user in this lesson you will learn about the main ideas and tools used in web
1:31:34
development this will help you talk to developers understand what is possible with your designs and design functional
1:31:40
websites so why do web designers need to understand how web development works right because we are designers right we
1:31:47
don't need to write code or anything so why do we need to understand how this works I will explain you why right now
1:31:54
here are five key ways this knowledge will benefit you number one you will communicate better as a web designer
1:32:00
understanding the basics of web development is crucial when you grasp web development Concepts you can
1:32:06
communicate more effectively with developers this means you can clearly explain your design ideas and
1:32:11
understanding their feedback and that leads to better communication number two you will create
1:32:17
more realistic designs knowing how websites are built help you create designs that are feasible to develop you
1:32:23
you can avoid making uh you know uh designs that are too difficult or too impossible to turn into real websites
1:32:30
and this makes your designs more practical and achievable number three you will solve problems more effectively
1:32:37
and that's because if you understand how development works you can think of solutions that work both for design and
1:32:43
development which is essential for creating a successful website number
1:32:48
four you will collaborate better with your team working with developers become smoother and more efficient when you
1:32:54
know the basics of web development you can collaborate better ensuring that the website looks good and functions well
1:33:01
this team work is crucial for a successful project and lastly number five you will improve user experience
1:33:07
understanding web development also helps you design websites that load quickly and are easy to use on different devices
1:33:14
you can comprehend what affects uh the website's performance and user experience leading to a better design
1:33:20
overall and with that the end of this lesson in this lesson you learn why web
1:33:25
designers need to understand how web development Works knowing the basics of web development helps designers create
1:33:31
designs that are practical and feasible to build this understanding leads to better collaboration with developers
1:33:37
more efficient workflows and ultimately more successful web design
1:33:42
projects so now that we've discussed the benefits of understanding web development it's time to dive into the
1:33:49
core technologies that make web development possible to build and design effective websites you need to be
1:33:55
familiar with three fundamental languages HTML CSS and JavaScript
1:34:01
together these three Technologies are essential for frontend development and what is front- end development frontend
1:34:08
web development is the practice of creating Visual and interactive parts of a website that users interact with
1:34:13
directly it focuses on the design layout and user experience we will go through the main
1:34:20
languages used for front-end development let's start with HTML the skeleton HTML
1:34:26
is like the skeleton of a body just as a skeleton provides the basic structure
1:34:32
for a body HTML provides the basic structure for a web page it defines the
1:34:37
elements and how they are organized like the bones Define the shape and form of a body HTML stands for hypertext markup
1:34:45
language and it consists of a series of elements also known as tags which Define
1:34:50
different parts of the content for example H1 is is a tag used for the main
1:34:55
heading while p is used for paragraphs HTML provides the basic
1:35:00
structure of a website allowing you to add text images links and um other
1:35:06
multimedia elements and HTML looks like this this is the code and the first
1:35:13
thing we see is the doc type HTML tag and this line is called the doc type declaration it tells the web browser
1:35:20
that the document is written in HTML 5 which is the latest version of HTML the
1:35:26
next tag we see is this one HTML and this tag STS the HTML document
1:35:32
everything inside this tag is part of the web page the next one is the head section and this section contains meta
1:35:39
information about the web page like the title character set and links to CSS or
1:35:44
JavaScript files this information is not displayed on the web page itself it's uh
1:35:49
internal so when you visit the web page you don't see this information anywhere now the title tag this tag defines the
1:35:57
title of the web page right so this appears on the browser Tab and helps users understand what the page is about
1:36:04
and when you see a slash in the name of a previous tag it means that the tag is being closed in this case we are closing
1:36:11
the head tag and this means that any content below this uh tag is not going
1:36:16
to appear on the website right so I hope this makes sense as I said before you don't have to you know memorize all this
1:36:22
or anything just become familiar with it now we see the body tag the body section contains all the content that will be
1:36:29
displayed on the web page such as text images links and other elements as I mentioned before the H1 tag is used for
1:36:37
the main heading of the page and this heading is usually the largest and most important piece of text on the page and
1:36:44
the P tag is used for paragraphs it defines a BL of text that is separated from other content by some space and
1:36:52
this right here is the image text the image tag is used to insert images into the web page the SRC attribute specifies
1:36:59
the path to the image file and the alt attribute provides alternative text to describe the image this alt text is
1:37:06
important for accessibility and is displayed if the image cannot be loaded so if the website breaks for some reason
1:37:13
or the user has um images blocked the alt text will be shown instead of the image the HTML code we just saw looks
1:37:20
like this in the browser and this is obvious viously something very basic just to show you but with HTML CSS and
1:37:27
JavaScript you can create amazing amazing websites now let's talk about CSS CSS is
1:37:33
like the Flesh and skin of a body just as flesh and skin provide color texture
1:37:39
and form to a body CSS add style and appearance to a web page it controls the
1:37:44
colors fonts layout and overall visual presentation of a page CSS stands for
1:37:49
cascading style sheets it consists of a series of rules that find how HTML elements should be displayed for example
1:37:56
you can use CSS to change the color of text set the background color of a page
1:38:01
or control the spacing between elements here is an example that includes CSS styles for the body H1 and P elements
1:38:09
the body selector applies styles to the entire body of the web page it sets the
1:38:14
background color to a light blue giving the entire page a soft blue background the H1 selector applies styles to all H1
1:38:21
elements on the page each sets the font to aial the font size to 24 pixel and the colors to Blue this means that all
1:38:29
H1 elements will use the aial font be size 24 pixels and have blue text if
1:38:35
aial is not available it will use the default sensory font sometimes specific fonts might not be available due to
1:38:41
browser limitations or other factors in such cases we can instruct the browser through CSS to use a different s font
1:38:49
this same approach can be used for Ser fonts as well if you are not familiar with the term serif and S serif don't
1:38:56
worry because you will learn these Concepts in the next module when you start designing your first website the P selector applies styles to
1:39:03
P elements on the page it sets the font to aial the font size to 14 pixels and the colors to Black this means that all
1:39:11
P elements will use the aerial font B size at 14 pixels and have a black text
1:39:17
and remember that P stands for a paragraph So CSS enhances the HTML
1:39:22
structure by providing in visual Styles making the web page not only functional but also visually appealing and this is
1:39:29
what happens when we link the CSS style to the HTML and now let's move to JavaScript
1:39:35
JavaScript is like the nervous system of a body just as the nervous system controls the actions and responses of a
1:39:42
body javascripts add interactivity and dynamic Behavior to a web page it
1:39:47
enables web pages to respond to user actions update content dynamically and
1:39:53
perform task without reloading the entire page it's basically a programming language that runs in the browser it
1:39:59
allows developers to create interactive features such as form validation animations and real-time
1:40:05
updates and JavaScript looks like
1:40:15
this working alongside the HTML and CSS JavaScript enhances the functionality
1:40:20
and user experience of a website so here is an example to illustrate how JavaScript works right imagine you have
1:40:27
an HTML file with a heading element H1 that you want to make interactive to
1:40:33
link to an external Javascript file you use this script tag uh placed just
1:40:38
before the closing body tag this ensures that the HTML content is fully loaded before the JavaScript runs just like I'm
1:40:45
showing you right now when you open a web page the browser loads the HTML and builds a structure of the page called
1:40:51
the document object model also called the the Dom the Dom represents the
1:40:56
elements of the page like the headings paragraphs and images in a tree like
1:41:01
structure that JavaScript uh can interact with to make sure that our JavaScript runs only after the whole
1:41:07
page is loaded we use this code this tells the browser to wait until the HTML is fully loaded and ready before running
1:41:14
the code inside this function think of it as waiting until all the pieces of a puzzle are in place before starting
1:41:20
working on it inside this function we use this code right here and this is to find the first H1 element on the page
1:41:28
the query selector method is like asking the browser to select a specific part of the page in this case it's selecting the
1:41:34
main header next we add an event listener to this heading using this code and an event listener is a way to make
1:41:41
the browser listen for certain actions like clicks and respond to them here we are telling the browser to do something
1:41:47
when the heading is clicked when we click the heading the function inside the event listener runs which displays
1:41:54
this alert box that says you click the heading and alert box is a simple way to show a message to the user and it pauses
1:42:02
the interaction until the user clicks okay here we can see a file structure of a website which is a folder that
1:42:08
includes HTML CSS and JavaScript and remember first we create the structure
1:42:14
which is the HTML then we style it with uh CSS and then we finally add
1:42:20
interactivity with JavaScript oh and we have the image that shows in the website
1:42:25
here as well so now we just learn how JavaScript Works alongside HTML and CSS
1:42:32
and once again do not worry too much about all these words and Concepts I just want you to have a basic
1:42:38
understanding of how the anatomy of a web page looks like you don't have to memorize all these terms and you don't
1:42:45
have to write any code just become familiar with these terms and if you feel really Brave you can complete the
1:42:50
optional exercise about building a basic HTML page at the end of this module and
1:42:55
uh if you have any questions you can just let me know by leaving a comment if you are watching this on YouTube or
1:43:01
better yet send me a DM if you are a member of our private group now let's talk about backend development backend
1:43:08
development is like the brain of a website just as the brain controls the body's functions and processes
1:43:14
information backend development handles the server side logic database interactions and the functionalities
1:43:21
that users don't see it ensures that everything works behind the scenes to deliver the correct information and
1:43:27
services to the front end and here are the main Technologies and languages
1:43:32
python processes data and handles server logic it is often used with Frameworks like Jango and flask to build web
1:43:40
applications and you might be asking what on Earth is a framework right so a
1:43:45
framework is a set of tools and libraries designed to help developers build applications more
1:43:50
efficiently it provides a structural way to organize and write code so you don't have to start from scratch for every
1:43:57
project think of it like a blueprint or a foundation that includes pre wien code and guidelines to help you create
1:44:04
software faster and more easily the next technology is node GS node GS allows JavaScript to run on the server site
1:44:11
while JavaScript is typically a front-end language nodejs enables it to be used for backend development as well
1:44:18
handling server requests and interacting with databases PHP is a serers side
1:44:23
scripting language for dynamic web pages and is commonly used with content Management Systems like WordPress Ruby
1:44:30
is another serers side programming language often used with their Ruby onr framework to build web applications and
1:44:36
finally we have SQL SQL manages and interacts with databases it is used to
1:44:42
store retrive and manipulate data in relational databases like MySQL and that's it for this lesson in
1:44:49
this lesson you learn what the core web development Technologies are and what they look like these Technologies
1:44:55
include HTML CSS and JavaScript you've also learned the difference between front end and backend web
1:45:02
development all right so in this lesson we will explore the concept of no code
1:45:09
development no code web development is a way to create websites without writing any code it uses special tools that let
1:45:16
you build websites by dragging and dropping elements like text images and buttons it's like using building blacks
1:45:22
to make something without needing to know how to code this makes it easier for anyone to
1:45:28
create websites without needing to learn complicated computer languages now we are going to explore
1:45:35
the best no code uh web development tools these are the ones I use and the ones I always
1:45:42
recommend the first one is framer framer is a powerful tool that lets you design
1:45:47
and build interactive websites quickly you can use Simple drag and drop features to add text images buttons and
1:45:54
more it's great for beginners and also offers Advanced features for more experienced
1:45:59
users and then the second one is web flow webflow is a bit more advanced but still doesn't require coding it allows
1:46:06
you to design and develop responsive websites with ease you can create complex designs and animations making it
1:46:13
ideal for more detailed projects and the one I will teach you
1:46:18
how to use is framer because framer is easier to understand for people that are just starting out and also in my opinion
1:46:25
it is better for designing websites that are simple but visually appealing and
1:46:31
interactive framers intuitive interface and versatile design options make it perfect for creating stunning websites
1:46:37
quickly and easily and if you learn how to design and then build your designs with
1:46:43
frameware you will possess two very powerful skills this will enable you to bring your creative ideas to life and
1:46:50
create professional quality websites on your own and you are probably asking when will we
1:46:55
start uh building with framework right you will learn how to use it and build your first website in module 10 but
1:47:03
don't rush right if you are a beginner go through all the uh modules one by one
1:47:08
and don't skip any module or lesson if you are more advanced and want to reinforce your knowledge also go through
1:47:15
the entire course without skipping anything no matter how experienced you are you will always learn something new
1:47:22
in this lesson you learned what no code web development is and what the best no code web development tools are no code
1:47:28
web development allows you to create websites without writing any code using visual tools and drag and drop
1:47:35
interfaces you also explore some of the best tools available for no code web development which makes it easier to
1:47:40
build and customize websites even if you don't have programming skills congratulations this is the end of
1:47:46
module two now it's time to practice what you've learned I've added some exercises for you to practice and you
1:47:52

1:49:23
to organize your pigma file understanding the brief is crucial for aligning your work with the client's
1:49:29
Vision by the end of this lesson you will be equipped with these skills to transform a brief into a clear
1:49:35
actionable plan that ensures your web design projects are both creative and
1:49:41
well organized so let's get started let's start by learning how to
1:49:47
understand the client's brief because this is essential for the success of any web design project
1:49:53
we will do a detailed analysis of the brief to ensure Clarity and alignment with the client's
1:49:59
Vision so the first thing is the project description or overview this right here
1:50:04
the project overview indicates that the client is an architecture Studio specializing in minimal and utilitarian
1:50:10
design they need a new website that reflects their design philosophy which is clean functional and elegant the
1:50:18
website should uh showcase their portfolio describe their services and make it easy for potential clients to
1:50:25
contact them so we already know that they prefer
1:50:30
Simplicity and functionality over fancy stuff and they have a clear goal which is to make it easy for potential clients
1:50:36
to reach out to them here they are pointing out who their ideal prospects are and in the
1:50:43
next lesson we will go more in detail by creating Persona profiles to be super specific about who we are designing
1:50:50
for because we are not designing for the client right in reality we are designing for the clients potential clients and
1:50:58
their existing client base as well here we have the project goals and the project goals include several key
1:51:03
objectives first the website should showcase the portfolio by creating a section for displaying images and
1:51:10
descriptions of their projects second it should detail the services offered by including a page
1:51:17
that outlines the architectural services third the website should include the
1:51:22
Studio through and um about us page with background information on the studio
1:51:27
design philosophy and team members fourth it should facilitate contact by designing a contact page with a form
1:51:34
location map and contact details such as phone number email and address fifth the
1:51:40
website must ensure usability by being easy to navigate and providing a seamless user experience sixth it should
1:51:46
be optimized for all devices ensuring that the website functions well on desktop tablet and mobile devic
1:51:53
lastly the website should improve visibility by incorporating basic SEO to help potential clients uh find it more
1:52:00
easily through search engines now let's talk about the design preferences the design preferences
1:52:06
include a neutral color palette furing white gray and black to emphasize Simplicity and elegance they would also
1:52:13
love to see some shades of blue the typography should use clean modern fonts
1:52:19
that are easy to read and contribute to a minimalistic aesthetic they didn't specify if they prefer s
1:52:25
serif for serif fonts so we will ask them later the layout should be grid based for a structured and orderly
1:52:33
appearance the image race should use high resolution images of projects with a minimal editing to focus on
1:52:40
architectural details and finally interactivity in terms of interactivity
1:52:45
they want something very simple and minimal because they don't want to overwhelm the user with uh with a lot of
1:52:50
fancy stuff right so we should keep it minimal and the budget they have a
1:52:56
$114,000 budget and um okay it has to include the uh initial consultations the
1:53:03
wireframes markups design revisions and the delivery of final design files all right and you want to
1:53:11
be very specific with the design revisions right because you don't want to be you know caught up in a loop of
1:53:18
infinite revisions but you will learn about that in much mod number five in
1:53:23
that module I will teach you how to navigate a contract so you can always get deals that are beneficial to both
1:53:30
you and your clients by following these guidelines the website will effectively communicate the studos expertise and
1:53:36
attract clients who appreciate their design principles understanding these detailed aspects of the brief will help
1:53:43
in creating a website that meets the client's needs and exceeds their expectations let's dive into the project
1:53:50
with this clear road map in mind now let's create the Persona profiles and
1:53:55
first I will explain what the Persona profiles are and why they are very important creating Persona profiles is a
1:54:02
crucial step in web design it involves understanding who your client's audience is personas are fictional characters
1:54:08
that represent the different user types who might use a website these profiles help you tailor the design and content
1:54:15
to meet the needs of the target audience let's define the key characteristics think about their age gender occupation
1:54:22
interest and goals for example if you are designing a website for an architecture Studio one person might be
1:54:29
a 45y old business owner looking to develop a new office building for example another Persona might be a young
1:54:36
couple interested in building a modern minimalistic home to create accurate personas
1:54:42
research is essential you can gather information through surveys interviews or analyzing data from existing
1:54:48
users this helps you understand their behaviors preferences and challenges for instance if most uh users access the
1:54:55
site on mobile devices the design should be mobile friendly and you should put a lot of focus into
1:55:02
that once you have gathered enough information it's time to develop detail profiles for each persona it's also cool
1:55:09
to give them realistic names and include a photo to make them more relatable it should also include a short biography
1:55:16
that includes their background needs and how they might use the website this makes it easier to visualize the user
1:55:23
and design a website that meets their needs and here is an example of some
1:55:28
Persona profiles we'll use to design the architecture Studio's website make sure to use these personas
1:55:35
throughout the design process refer to them when making decisions about layout content and functionality ask yourself
1:55:41
how each Persona will interact with the website this helps you ensure that the design is user Center and caters to the
1:55:47
actual needs of the client's audience remember personas can evolve time as you
1:55:53
gather more data and insights update your personas to reflect any changes this continuous Improvement helps keep
1:56:00
the website relevant and effective for its users so when we start designing our website we will use these Persona
1:56:05
profiles as a reference point now let's create the mood board using figma so what is a mood board a
1:56:13
mood board is a visual tool that helps you convey the style tone and overall feeling of a project it's a collection
1:56:20
of images colors typography and all the design elements that represent the desire aesthetic of a website mood
1:56:27
boards are used in the early stages of a design project to establish a cohesive vision and ensure everyone involved is
1:56:33
on the same page and why should we create a mood board creating a mood board is essential for several reasons
1:56:40
first it helps clarify your ideas and give you a clearer direction for your design by compiling various uh visual
1:56:47
elements you can see how they work together and make adjustments before starting the actual design
1:56:53
second it serves as a communication tool between you and your client it allows
1:56:58
you to represent your vision in a tangible way and get feedback early in the process lastly it helps maintain
1:57:04
consistency throughout the project by referring back to the moodboard you can ensure that all Design Elements align
1:57:11
with the established aesthetic and what is the best time to create a mood board the best time to
1:57:16
create a mood board is at the beginning of the design process after you have understood the clients brief and created
1:57:22
the uh you know the personal profiles this ensures that the mood board reflects the needs and preferences of
1:57:27
the target audience while aligning with the client's Vision so creating the mood board early on helps set the tone for
1:57:34
the entire project so here are the steps to create a mood board number one gather
1:57:40
inspiration start by collecting images color pets typography examples and other
1:57:45
visual elements that resonate with uh the desire style you can also use design
1:57:50
websites magazines and even photos you take yourself as source of
1:57:55
inspiration this step is crucial as it helps you understand the visual Direction you want to take and provides
1:58:02
a foundation for your mood board additionally it's always good to ask the client to send you the links to three to
1:58:09
10 websites they like and then request that they explain why they like these uh
1:58:14
sites pointing out what they like the most and what they like the least this input can provide valuable insights and
1:58:21
ensure that your mood board aligns with their Vision number two organize your elements once you have gathered your
1:58:27
visual elements the next step is to organize them in a way that makes sense to you you can create digital mood
1:58:33
boards using tools like enva or make a physical one by cutting and pasting elements onto a board I like to create
1:58:41
all my mood boards in figma organizing your elements helps you see how different visuals work together and
1:58:47
ensures a cohesive look number three Define the mood ensure that your mood
1:58:53
board clearly conveys the overall mood and style of the project it should evoke the right emotions and give a sense of
1:59:00
what the final design will look like this step is about refining your choices and making sure that the mood board
1:59:05
aligns with the desire aesthetic of the project and lastly use it as a reference
1:59:11
once your mood board is finalized use it as a reference throughout the design process it will help you stay consistent
1:59:16
and ensure that all Design Elements work harmoniously together by regularly referring back to your mood board you
1:59:23
can maintain the established aesthetic and ensure that your final design aligns with the initial Vision let's create the
1:59:30
mood board for this architecture stud website and the first thing we have to do is to copy and paste the brief here
1:59:37
so we can see it at all times to access the brief go to the resource page by clicking on the link in the description
1:59:43
and then once you are in the resource page you will see a section titled designing your first website in that
1:59:49
section you will see the link that takes you to the will document that contains the brief and then the next thing is to
1:59:56
create a frame and to do it you can just come here and click frame or press uh F
2:00:02
on your keyboard and then we can create the frame it can be any size something
2:00:08
like this is fine the next step is to rename the frame we can add here mood
2:00:15
board all right so now we can start adding some images but first let's go to the brief let's go here where it says
2:00:23
design preferences and let's take a look again okay they prefer a neutral color
2:00:31
palette including white gray and black to emphasize Simplicity and elegance okay uh you could also add some
2:00:38
shades of blue or other cold colors all right
2:00:44
typography they like clean modern phones that are easy to read and contribute to a minimalistic aesthetic all right the
2:00:52
layout a grid based layout okay and imagery high resolution
2:00:59
images okay we have that and then interactivity all right that's for prototyping
2:01:05
so let's start let's add some images and we will add the images through the
2:01:10
unsplash plugin so let's uh right click and then go to plugins and
2:01:18
unsplash and here you can search any email that you think would fit the Des
2:01:24
aesthetic like for example and you go to license I mean all
2:01:32
licenses and click free because we want to see free images only and then you can
2:01:37
just like search and you know add different
2:01:45
images so here is the mood board I created and I didn't only use and splash right I also use all sources of
2:01:52
inspiration and I will show them to you but first I will walk you through the mood board and I mean so you can better
2:02:00
understand my thought process as you can see I Incorporated many architectural structures as
2:02:05
reference different tones of color have been used to represent the client's aesthetic
2:02:11
request and um as you can see here Greek architecture both ancient and modern is
2:02:16
featured because it embodies the concept of Simplicity very well the clean lines
2:02:22
minimalist design of Greek buildings align perfectly with the client's Vision I also ensure that the moodboard
2:02:29
showcases different shades of blue which we can use extensively throughout the
2:02:34
project uh as you can see here you see and additionally I included some images
2:02:40
with subtle orange stones in various elements although orange was not specified in the brief I believe that
2:02:46
combining white black and blue and then add a touch of orange creates a a
2:02:52
beautiful contrast the orange will be used sparingly so just a little bit
2:02:57
focusing primarily on the uh nut I mean neutral tones and shades of
2:03:02
blue this approach allows us to maintain a clean elegant aesthetic while adding a
2:03:08
subtle vibrant uh touch to enhance the overall visual
2:03:13
appeal I've also added some images featuring text so I can use them as
2:03:19
inspiration When selecting the typography for the we website I might not use these exact fonts but I'll
2:03:25
probably choose one that is similar so here are some of the sources
2:03:31
I use for inspiration number one search system search system is an Ever growing collection of references and tools for
2:03:37
designers this resource is designed to inspire and support designers by providing a diverse pool of visual
2:03:44
materials including images Graphics typography and more the platform includes curated
2:03:51
collection C from various categories such as digital drawings exhibitions
2:03:56
Furniture Graphics photography typography and websites making it a very
2:04:03
valuable source for Creative inspiration and Design Elements additionally it features
2:04:09
profiles of notable designers and Studios offering insights into their work and creative processes everything
2:04:16
is very well organized and I really appreciate that number two is lbook lbook is an Ever growing collection of
2:04:22
handpicked websites and it also offers a lot of different visual materials to
2:04:27
inspire and support creative projects the platform features a variety of
2:04:33
website types and graphic Styles so check it out number three is made in webflow made
2:04:39
in webflow is a curated Showcase of websites build using webflow the portfolio includes a diverse range of
2:04:46
popular projects featuring everything from sleep portfolios and interactive websites to e-commerce
2:04:52
Solutions these websites are some of the sources I use for inspiration but I also use books I have added a more extensive
2:05:01
list of sources on the inspiration page go to the inspiration Page by clicking
2:05:06
the link in the description right below where it says resources before we dive into designing
2:05:12
wireframes it's crucial to set up our file efficiently since we are using the free version of figma we'll have some
2:05:19
limitations such as the number of Pages we can create but no worries we'll work
2:05:24
within these constraints effectively before creating the pages create a new design file if you can't
2:05:31
create a new design file due to the free plan limitations go to the uh home dashboard and then remove these two
2:05:37
design files these are default pages that come with figma and we don't need them for
2:05:44
our project so right click and then click on delete the first step is to create the
2:05:51
Pages we use throughout the project and here is how to structure them page number one will be dedicated to
2:05:57
organizing our wireframes and components and also some other stuff like the Persona profiles the project brief and
2:06:04
the mood board keeping these elements together helps us manage the limitations of figma's free plan while maintaining a
2:06:11
clean and efficient workspace as you begin working on projects and collaborating with clients it's
2:06:17
advisable to upgrade to a Premium figma plan the this will remove the limitations of the free plan and allow
2:06:24
for more advanced organization of your design file I will also be creating in depth an advanced organization guides
2:06:31
which I will share in our private community and then create another page for the main design this will help you
2:06:38
make sure that your final designs are easy to find and not mix with other elements the third page will be the bin
2:06:45
and this is where you will put uh elements you decide not to use but want to keep just in case it's like a storage
2:06:51
space for your design ideas and drafts another thing I like to do is to create local Styles and we will create local
2:06:57
Styles in lesson 3.8 when we uh you know create our style guide and this helps
2:07:03
keep you know colors consistent throughout the entire design we will also use a simple but clear naming
2:07:09
convention to make sure that every frame and component is easy to find especially when working with a team for example
2:07:16
instead of bag names we will use specific ones like Heather hyphen logo for the logo in the Heather or contact
2:07:22
form H submit button for the submit button in the contact form use the layers panel and sections
2:07:29
to manage different elements within a page effectively when you are working with a team you can use the comments for
2:07:35
feedback and the verion history to track changes to add a comment in figma select the comment tool from the toolbar right
2:07:43
here or press C on your keyboard click on the area of the design where you want to leave a comment and type your
2:07:50
feedback or note comments are visible to all collaborators and team members can reply
2:07:55
to them making it very easy to have discussions directly within the design file you can easily hide or show
2:08:02
comments as needed here is how right click anywhere in the canvas and select show or hide comments you can also use
2:08:09
the keyboard shortcut shift plus C to quickly toggle comments on and off this is a convenient way to manage comment
2:08:15
visibility while working on your design by following this structure you will keep your figma file organized efficient
2:08:22
even with the limits of the free plan to access the version history go
2:08:28
here and then file and then show version history and it appears
2:08:36
here then you can click on any version you want to
2:08:43
recover before we proceed let's change the name of the file to architecture
2:08:48
Studio in this lesson you learn how to
2:08:54
understand the project brief what Persona profiles are how to create a mood board and where to find the
2:09:00
inspiration and how to organize your figma file now it's finally time to start designing the wireframe for the
2:09:06
architecture Studio website but first I want to explain what a wireframe is so
2:09:11
you can clearly understand the concept A wireframe is a simple visual
2:09:17
guide that shows the layout of a web page it outlines where different elements like headers images buttons and
2:09:24
text Will Go wireframes are like blueprints for the website helping you plan the structure before adding details
2:09:31
like colors and images this way we can focus on the layout and functionality of the website
2:09:37
without getting distracted by Design Elements understanding wireframes is important because they are the first
2:09:42
step in creating a well organized and userfriendly website you don't have to use wireframes on every project and
2:09:48
every time you do a website right sometimes I design websites without creating wireframes especially when it's
2:09:54
a simple landing page or a quick project however when you are working with a team
2:09:59
especially with big companies they will probably require you to work on wireframes usually large companies also
2:10:06
have someone especially um you know responsible for Designing the wireframe ux while someone else is in charge of
2:10:13
Designing the UI that's why it's important for you to know how to design them W frames help ensure that everyone
2:10:20
is on the same page p and understands the structure and functionality of the website before adding detail Design
2:10:26
Elements so without further Ado let's start designing the wireframes for the architecture Studio
2:10:32
website we will design a lowf five wireframe low five stands for low fidelity meaning we will not uh you know
2:10:39
over complicate anything we will create a rough and basic wireframe to get a
2:10:44
better idea of where things will be placed in the final design before we continue please pay attention as figma
2:10:51
evolves you might notice some features have moved since this recording but don't worry because figma provides a
2:10:57
detail guide tracking all changes with each update the core principles stay the same features are just reorganized
2:11:04
updated or occasionally replaced you can find any relocated features in figma's official guide which I recommend
2:11:11
bookmarking for reference here is the URL and I will also leave a link in the description you will adapt to user
2:11:18
interface changes very quickly and current L if you prefer you can also switch back to the old interface by
2:11:25
clicking here though this option may not be permanent so if you don't see this
2:11:30
option refer to the official guide all right so let's start by creating a desktop size frame by pressing F on our
2:11:38
keyboard then here on the properties panel we'll click on desktop here we
2:11:44
have it now let's resize the height of the frame something like this for now
2:11:52
we will resize it later as we add the content now let's change the name of the
2:11:57
frame to desktop hyphen
2:12:02
homepage and now it's time to start adding some uh elements inside of the frame since this is a lowf wireframe we
2:12:11
will not add any text so we will do everything with shapes all right so let's create the header to do so we'll
2:12:19
create a rectangle so let's click on the rectangle tool right here and then let's
2:12:26
go back to the frame and let's create something like
2:12:32
this you don't have to use the exact sizes of the shapes I'm creating approximate sizes are fine since we will
2:12:39
adjust them during the final design phase all right now let's select the shape we just created and then press and
2:12:47
hold alt and drag the rectangle to create a copy
2:12:52
we can place the copy here for now next let's resize the shape to make it
2:12:57
smaller as this shape will represent the logo now let's align the logo with the
2:13:03
uh you know with the menu by dragging it right here approximately here is
2:13:11
fine now we will create the heading text which will be an introduction and you
2:13:17
know main value proposition of the architecture Studio the main value value proposition is a clear statement that
2:13:23
explains how a product or a service solves a problem or improves a situation
2:13:29
for their clients it highlights the key benefits and why someone should choose
2:13:34
your client's offering over others so in simple terms it's what makes a product
2:13:40
or a service attractive and avilable to a target audience usually a copywriter
2:13:45
is in charge of writing a compelling main value proposition but I always say
2:13:50
that web designers should learn copywriting it's a very nice complimentary skill to have because even
2:13:56
though as you advance in your career you will less likely be in charge of writing the copy it's always good to be able to
2:14:03
give some you know valuable uh suggestions and feedback it makes you a more valuable designer a lot of great
2:14:10
designers are also very good at copyrighting so you know and uh I want
2:14:15
you to be above average that's why I'm telling you all this so to create the
2:14:20
repres presentation of the text uh in the wireframe we will also use shapes we
2:14:26
could use dummy text like glorm Ipson but we are not going to do that you know
2:14:31
we will uh keep it simple let's create a rectangle and then stretch it like this let's make it a
2:14:39
little thinner all right like this is fine and then we will uh Center it now
2:14:46
let's do the same as we did to create the logo so let's select the rectangle and then press hold uh you know press
2:14:53
and hold alt and drag to make a copy all right so let's do it again and again now
2:15:03
we have four lines of quote unquote text this will be our heading text in the
2:15:08
homepage which will contain the main value proposition now we'll create a heading
2:15:14
title and this will be a large title that says something like work or projects because we will display the
2:15:19
latest Ora most important projects of the architecture Studio below this title since it's just one word uh we can
2:15:26
actually write it as a placeholder we will write the title and set it to 200
2:15:32
pixels for now then Center it something like this is
2:15:38
fine now we'll create the homepage work or project sections let's say that they
2:15:44
have six projects they want to show in the homepage to Showcase these projects we
2:15:50
will will create six project cards in rows of two each card will be formed by
2:15:56
one image and then a text below the image the image will be a preview of the
2:16:02
project the text will be the Project's name and the location let's start
2:16:07
creating one card with a rectangle like this we will multiply it later by copying and pasting or pressing and
2:16:14
holding alt and dragging it now let's create a small rectangle and stretch it
2:16:19
to simulate what would be the Project's name and the location now let's align this to the
2:16:26
left right here and then let's select both and press contrl G or command G if
2:16:32
you are on a Mac to create a group grouping this together will make it easier for us to move it around if we
2:16:39
need to we can also group this and
2:16:46
this so let's align this to the left so it's per perfectly aligned with the logo
2:16:52
and then let's uh select it and then press alt and then drag while
2:16:59
maintaining uh you know alt pressed to create a
2:17:07
copy let's move this one a little closer to the other and then let's select both
2:17:12
maintain shift and then resize them something like this we don't have to
2:17:18
worry too much about the margins right now we will make sure that everything is perfectly aligned later when we do the
2:17:24
final design all right so let's select the frame and then resize it so we can add
2:17:32
uh you know the other cards so something like this we will fix it later we will uh
2:17:39
resize it later so um so it's not too to you know like the height is not too much
2:17:46
and now we will select these both and then we will press uh control or command
2:17:52
G to create another group and then we will select this group and then we will
2:17:57
press uh you know alt and then we'll make a copy by
2:18:02
dragging and then we'll make another copy and now we have the uh six projects
2:18:10
right here and yes now this is starting to
2:18:15
look like an organized website let's create a CTA a CTA or call to action is
2:18:21
an element that encourages users to take a specific action it can be a button or
2:18:26
a link or any other interactive element designed to prompt immediate response or engagement from the user our CTA will be
2:18:33
a text that will help users discover more projects for now as a placeholder we will name it CTA and we will place it
2:18:40
here centered below the homepage project section and let's resize the CTA to 100
2:18:49
pixels the the next section we will add is the F section and we will do so by creating another rectangle like
2:19:04
this looking at the wif frame I think there is something missing which is giving emphasis to a project the client
2:19:10
requested six projects on the homepage but we'll make a new version which uh you know that includes seven projects
2:19:17
instead one of these projects will be highlighted as is the most important one and will be placed in a prominent
2:19:24
position let's make a copy by selecting this Frame and drag it while holding
2:19:31
alt now let's resize the copied frame and make some space here and then we can
2:19:39
uh copy one of these cards to uh resize them to something like this for this one
2:19:47
don't press and hold shift because we want to modify by the aspect ratio of the rectangle and do not press and hold
2:19:55
alt and drag because if we do that it will remain part of the group with the other two cards and we want it to be
2:20:02
independent so just copy and paste by pressing control or command C and then
2:20:07
control or command V and then drag the card to move it up just like I did and
2:20:13
when pasting the card make sure you click inside of the parent frame because if not it still will be part of the
2:20:19
group now let's resize the Project's name a little bit like
2:20:27
this as designers it's our responsibility to always provide suggestions and advice to our clients if
2:20:35
we have ideas that can improve the design therefore we have created a
2:20:40
second option these iterations don't take too much time to make so don't shy away from speaking your mind it's
2:20:47
essential to communicate our creative insights to ensure that that we deliver the best possible outcome by emphasizing
2:20:54
this key project we can draw more attention to it and enhance the overall impact of the homepage let's reduce the
2:21:01
spacing here by selecting and dragging all these elements up now we can resize the frame
2:21:07
a little bit and since we created the wireframe only using shapes it's always
2:21:13
good practice to add different color Shades to the different sections and
2:21:18
items we can also change the images to a darker shade of gray and the text and
2:21:24
the representations of text to Black we can keep the sections such as the fotter
2:21:30
in the current color to select multiple elements individually in figma hold down
2:21:35
shift and click on each element since these shapes representing the images are
2:21:41
inside a group select them individually by pressing control on Windows or command on Mac plus shift there is a
2:21:49
better way to select multiple elements to change their color using a figma plugin called select similar I will show
2:21:56
you how to do it right now first right click anywhere on the canvas and go to plugins then click on
2:22:04
manage plugins and type select similar here in the search bar and then install
2:22:10
and run the plugin next select one of the shapes by pressing and holding control or command
2:22:17
or Mac and shift and then clicking on on the shape in the plugin choose the width
2:22:23
and height option then click on select layer sample finally click on select similar
2:22:30
to select all these shapes with similar properties and now you have all the similar shapes selected and you can
2:22:36
easily change their
2:22:44
colors now let's change the color of this individual image as well so let's select
2:22:51
and then we will do the same with the
2:22:58
text this is going to be in color
2:23:04
black this as well and then this we can just
2:23:09
select and change that's
2:23:18
it all right so we have these two options now and uh we are going to
2:23:24
change the names I mean just add for example for this one option two because this is the
2:23:31
second option and then for this one option one all
2:23:38
right now we are going to create the uh uh tablet version and the mobile version
2:23:44
and but first let's drag this one here and then this one
2:23:51
so we know that this version is the first version that we I mean we are not going to work uh with this version yet
2:23:58
but we'll keep it here for now so to create the uh tablet version let's
2:24:04
create a new frame right here and then we'll select the tablet the iPad Pro
2:24:12
11 all right here it is and then we place it here and then we stretch
2:24:21
this let me change the name as well we are going to call
2:24:28
it tablet homepage all right and uh this is very
2:24:36
simple because there is only a few things that will change so for now we'll
2:24:42
uh copy this and then we'll paste it here and then we will resize it
2:24:50
something like this is fine for the tablet version I like to create a clickable menu that expands after
2:24:56
clicking some people call it hamburger menu but instead of an icon I like to write the actual word
2:25:04
menu you might be a little bit confused right now but I will show you what I'm talking about so let me Zoom here and
2:25:12
then I will make a copy then I will delete this and then I will add some text here
2:25:22
I
2:25:28
resize and then this will be the menu right and then when people click you
2:25:34
know it will expand and we will see all the menu options so this is what I
2:25:40
mean all right so let's delete this and then let's resize
2:25:46
this something like this is fine so this represents the menu icon or Link
2:25:53
in the wif frame we will copy and paste the title here and then we will Center it we'll
2:26:00
copy and paste this as well and then we will we will resize something like this
2:26:05
is fine and when you resize this remember to not uh press and hold shift because
2:26:13
we want to modify the aspect ratio all right and now we will select all these
2:26:20
and then we will paste it here as well and then we will do the same we will resize and then something more like this
2:26:30
maybe all right and we'll do the same with
2:26:37
this okay here is fine for now we will resize this
2:26:46
to um something like 70 pixels Maybe
2:26:51
yeah we'll Center it as well and then we'll copy and paste
2:26:57
this here somewhere here is
2:27:04
fine all right and then let's resize the
2:27:10
frame and that's it now we have the you know the tablet version and it
2:27:17
will have also two columns and as we going to I mean as we are going to see
2:27:22
now the uh the mobile version will not have two columns it's going to be all in one column and now I will explain
2:27:30
why so let's move this a little bit up let's select everything and then move
2:27:38
it and we'll do the same
2:27:45
here all right just fixing the fer a little bit
2:27:51
and then let's resize the frame now like this and like
2:27:57
this all right and now we'll create the mobile version to do so let's create a
2:28:03
frame and then let's select the iPhone 8 here we have
2:28:09
it let's move it here and then let's
2:28:14
resize all right and then now we'll copy everything basically so let's copy and paste
2:28:24
here something like this let's reside this as
2:28:30
well let's Center
2:28:36
it like this right let's copy and paste the
2:28:43
title as well let's Center it and then we'll
2:28:48
resize it to 100 pixels all
2:28:56
right then we'll copy this image as well and the project
2:29:05
title something yeah something like this is
2:29:10
fine and we will uh we will duplicate all these
2:29:17
cards until we have
2:29:23
s let's resize these more all
2:29:34
right all right now the CTA we'll paste it
2:29:44
here and then the footer
2:29:56
here is
2:30:03
fine all
2:30:09
right let's change the name of this Frame to to
2:30:15
Mobile homepage actually let's move this
2:30:20
version to the pin right now because we are not going to work on it and uh this is a version we will show obviously in
2:30:28
real life we would show it to the uh to the client but uh you know right now we
2:30:35
like we don't need it right because we know this version is better and we will work on this so let's uh select the
2:30:43
frame and then press control or command X and then let's go to the bin right
2:30:51
here and then contrl V to paste all
2:30:57
right now let's create the expanded menus for this uh version the tablet and
2:31:03
the mobile versions so to do so let's delete everything minus this icon right
2:31:09
or the link which is going to be where uh people will click to open or close
2:31:15
the menu and to do that we'll make a copy
2:31:21
of this Frame and then another copy of this
2:31:26
Frame and then we will delete everything minus
2:31:35
this right and we will do the same thing
2:31:42
here all right now we'll create the menu items
2:31:56
on mobile devices we need more space between menu items than on tablet because mobile screens are smaller this
2:32:02
helps prevent accidental tabs people often use phones with one hand making it
2:32:08
harder to tap small closely space items you can modify the space between items
2:32:13
here on the properties panel also mobile phones are used while moving so quick
2:32:19
and easy interact ctions are important tablets have larger screens and are used
2:32:24
um in a more stable way so they can have less space between items while still being uh easy to
2:32:31
use we have now completed the design of the structure for our home page wireframes across the three main break
2:32:38
points desktop tablet and mobile next we'll design the wireframes for the
2:32:44
remaining Pages uh referring back to the brief to determine which pages to create
2:32:49
let's let's check the brief here we can see that we need to create fourment Pages a portfolio or a projects page a
2:32:57
Services page and about this page and a contact page we'll also create a blog
2:33:04
page since they want us to focus on SEO as well after creating these Pages we'll
2:33:09
create all the boring Pages you know the terms and conditions page the legal note
2:33:15
page and the you know all that ja since you already know the Basics on
2:33:20
how to structure a wireframe I created the wireframes of all the pages beforehand as you can see here this will
2:33:27
help you understand the end goal more clearly your task will be to complete
2:33:32
the wireframes as an exercise this way you can see how everything comes together and ask questions if needed it
2:33:39
will make the learning process more efficient and ensure you can confidently create the wireframes on your own and
2:33:46
again don't worry if your wireframe doesn't look Pixel Perfect or or exactly like mine as long as it has the same
2:33:53
structure and number of elements it's fine we'll get everything right in the next design phase so I've created some
2:34:01
sections and plac all the wireframes inside of them for better organization sections in figma are organizational
2:34:08
tools that allow you to group and manage related frames or elements within a design project to create a section
2:34:16
create a frame first then right click inside the frame and click on convert to section you can turn any frame into a
2:34:24
section I use different subtle shades of blue to distinguish between the desktop
2:34:30
tablet and mobile versions of the pages the use of the shades helps to
2:34:35
visually separate the section slightly maintaining a more subtle and elegant
2:34:40
appearance feel free to use any color Shades you prefer when designing and presenting your wi frames I would use a
2:34:47
you know shade of blue or maybe a gray you know or maybe a neutral tone or you
2:34:53
know something like that I've also added comments to explain some elements and sections you can access the figma file
2:35:00
containing the wireframes by visiting this page free webdesign course.com SL
2:35:06
wireframes use this figma file as reference and try to uh replicate the design remember that it doesn't have to
2:35:13
be 100% accurate just make sure it includes a similar number of elements and that it follows these same structure
2:35:20
since it's the structure we'll use for the final design if you have any questions about how to complete this or
2:35:27
if you get stuck make a post in the private community and we'll help you out
2:35:33
in this lesson you've learned what w frames are and how to design them in this lesson we will talk about colors
2:35:39
and why they have a significant impact on design colors play a vital role in how we perceive and interact with the
2:35:45
world around us and they are a powerful tool in the hands of skill
2:35:50
designer so let's start with the color theory the color theory is a very important aspect of design that involves
2:35:56
the study of how colas interact and the visual effects they create when combined understanding color theory is
2:36:03
essential for web designers as it helps in creating visually appealing and effective designs this lesson will guide
2:36:08
you through the basics of color theory including the color whe color harmonies and the psychological impact of
2:36:15
colors so the color wheel the color wheel is a fundamental tool in color Theory it's a circular diagram of colors
2:36:21
arranged by chromatic relationship the primary colors red blue and yellow are the foundation of the
2:36:28
color wheel mixing these primary colors create secondary colors like green orange and purple further mixing of the
2:36:35
primary colors and secondary colors produce tertiary colors the color wheel helps designers understand the
2:36:41
relationship between colors and how they can be combined to create harmonious designs so what are color harmonies
2:36:48
color harmonies refer to the pleasing combination of colors based on their position on the color wheel common color
2:36:54
harmonies include complimentary analogous and triadic schemes complimentary colors are opposite each
2:37:00
other on the color wheel such as red and green and create a vibrant contrast analogous colors are close to each other
2:37:07
in the color wheels such as green blue and turquoise providing a harmonious and soothing effect triadic colors are
2:37:13
evenly spaced around the wheel such as red yellow and blue so now let's talk about the psychological impact of of
2:37:20
colors colors can evoke emotions and influence perceptions making their psychological impact and essential
2:37:27
consideration in design for example red often signifies passion energy or
2:37:32
urgency While Blue conveys calmness trust and professionalism yellow can
2:37:37
evoke happiness and optimism but it can also cause eye strain if overuse
2:37:42
understanding the psychological effects of colors helps designers create websites that resonate with their target
2:37:48
audience and effectively communicate the desire message depending on the culture the perception and meaning of colors can
2:37:54
vary significantly for instance while red is associated with good luck and celebration in Chinese culture it can
2:38:00
symbolize uh danger and warning in Western cultures similarly white
2:38:05
signifies Purity and peace in many Western cultures but is often associated with mourning and death in some Asian
2:38:12
cultures being aware of these cultural differences is crucial for designers working on global or Multicultural
2:38:19
projects so how we should use color in web design when applying color theory in web design it's important to consider
2:38:26
the overall user experience consistent and thoughtful use of color can guide users attention enhance readability and
2:38:33
create a cohesive print identity for example using a color scheme that aligns with the Brand's logo and overall
2:38:38
aesthetic can strengthen brand recognition additionally we should be mindful of accessibility ensuring that
2:38:45
color choices do not hinder the usability of the website for individuals with color blindness or other visual
2:38:51
impairments so in conclusion a solid understanding of color theory is essential for creating effective and
2:38:57
Visually opening web designs by mastering the color wheel exploring various color harmonies and considering
2:39:03
the psychological impact of colors we can craft websites that not only look
2:39:08
good but also um you know communicate the desired message to the audience
2:39:13
remember the Strategic use of colors can make a significant difference in the success of your web design projects
2:39:20
in this part of the lesson we will learn how to use figma's color tools to create and apply color schemes in your designs
2:39:26
figma offers a variety of tools to help you choose and manage colors in your design projects these tools include the
2:39:32
Color Picker color styles and the color palette the Color Picker allows you to
2:39:38
select colors for any elements in your design you can pick colors from the color wheel enter specific color codes
2:39:44
or even simple um colors from other parts of your design even from images like you are seeing right now color
2:39:51
styles help you keep your colors consistent across your design once you create a color style you can apply to
2:39:57
multiple elements and if you need to change the color later you can just uh you know update the color style and all
2:40:03
linked elements will change automatically just like this this is very powerful and saves a
2:40:11
lot of time a color palette is a collection of colors that you use in your design figma
2:40:17
lets you create in safe palettes making it easy to reuse colors and maintain a cohesive look throughout your project
2:40:24
I've listed some resources books and tools to help you better understand the importance of colors and how to use them
2:40:29
properly when designing you can access this list by going to free webdesign course.com SLC
2:40:37
colors images play a vital role in web design enhancing visual appeal and helping to communicate messages more
2:40:44
effectively here are some tips to ensure that you use images effectively in your designs
2:40:50
tip number one choose high quality images always use high quality images in
2:40:55
your designs blurry or pixelated images can make your website look
2:41:00
unprofessional opt for images that are clear sharp and well composed high
2:41:06
quality images can significantly enhance the overall look and feel of your design
2:41:11
tip number two ensure relevance the images you choose should be relevant to your content and purpose they should uh
2:41:18
support the message you are trying to convey for example if you are designing for a you know a website for an
2:41:24
architectural Studio use a images of buildings blueprint and Architectural details relevant images make your
2:41:32
content more engaging and meaningful to your audience most of the times the you know the client is going to send you the
2:41:39
images but you often times you will also have to search you know through uh stack
2:41:45
photos and you know maybe even do a little bit of uh creative directing and
2:41:51
and collaborating with photographers so you have to make sure that the images are you know are nice
2:41:57
and very relevant to the um you know to the main purpose of the website and this
2:42:02
is very obvious but I wanted to tell you about this because I think it's very
2:42:08
important tip number three optimize image sizes large images can slow down
2:42:13
your website leading to a poor user experience optimize your images to reduce their file size without
2:42:19
compromising on quality this can be done using various tools and techniques such as compression
2:42:25
resizing and using appropriate formats like jpeg or PNG I will share with you
2:42:30
some nice tools to optimize your images at the end of this lesson tip number four use a consistent style maintain a
2:42:37
consistent style for all images across the website these could include the use of similar filters color schemes or
2:42:45
compositions consistency helps create a cohesive and professional look enhancing the overall visual Harmony of the
2:42:52
website tip number five pay attention to the placement carefully consider where you place images within your design
2:42:59
images should complement your layout and not overwhelm the text or other elements
2:43:04
use images to guide the viewer ey and support the flow of information tip number six use images to evoke emotions
2:43:12
images have the power to evoke emotions and create a connection with the audience choose images that elicit the
2:43:19
desire emotional response whether it's excitement trust or Tranquility
2:43:24
emotional engagement can make your content more memorable and impactful in this lesson you learned what the cola
2:43:30
theory is and how it impacts design and you also learned about the psychological
2:43:35
effects of colors let's move to the next lesson typography is a crucial component of
2:43:42
design that goes beyond Aesthetics it involves the Strategic arrangement of text to ensure Clarity readability and
2:43:48
visual B understanding typography importance is essential for creating designs that
2:43:54
effectively communicate your message and engage the audience in this lesson we will dive into the basics of typography
2:44:01
helping you appreciate its role and learn how to use it to enhance your web designs so let's talk about type faces
2:44:07
and fonts a type face is a family of related fonts and a font is a specific
2:44:13
style and weight within that family for example aial is a type face while aerial
2:44:18
bold and aerial italic are fonts within that type face choosing the right type face for your design is essential as it
2:44:25
affects the overall aesthetic and readability of your text now let's explore the differences between shif and
2:44:31
S serif Type faces type faces are generally categorize into two main groups serif and S serif serif Type
2:44:38
faces have a small decorative lines or extensions at the end of their letters such as the Times New Roman type phase
2:44:46
they are often considered more traditional and or typically using print media sensor type faces like aiel do not
2:44:53
have these lines and are seen as more modern and clean making them popular for digital screens now let's talk about
2:45:00
hierarchy emphasis typography helps create a visual hierarchy in your design guiding users through the content in a
2:45:07
structured way headings subheadings body Texs and captions should all have
2:45:12
distinct styles to indicate their level of importance using different font sizes weights and styles help establish the is
2:45:19
our hierarchy and ensure that your content is easy to navigate now readability and legibility readability
2:45:26
refers to how easily the text can be read and understood while legibility is about how easily individual characters
2:45:32
can be distinguished factors affecting readability and legibility include phone
2:45:37
Choice text size line height and contrast between text and background ensure that your text is large enough to
2:45:44
read comfortably and that there is enough space between lines to prevent them from running together
2:45:50
now let's talk about line length and Alignment the optimal line length for body text is typically between 50 to 75
2:45:56
characters per line lines that are too long or Too Short can make reading difficult additionally text alignment
2:46:02
impacts readability and Aesthetics left align text is generally easiest to read
2:46:07
and I mean while centered or right align text can be used for shorter lines or specific design purposes now color and
2:46:15
contrast the color of your text and its contrast with the background ground are crucial for readability high contrast
2:46:21
between text and background enhances readability while low contrast uh can strain the eye for example black text on
2:46:28
a white background is highly readable whereas light gray text on a white background is not however it's generally
2:46:34
recommended to avoid using pure black for text pure black can create two har a contrast making it difficult to read for
2:46:41
extended periods instead consider using a very dark gray such as this one this
2:46:47
one or even this one this slight adjustment can reduce high
2:46:52
strain and make the text more comfortable to read for very large text you can use lower contrast since the
2:46:58
size itself enhances readability large text is already more legible so slightly reducing the contrast can still maintain
2:47:05
readability while providing a more pleasant visual experience but you have to be careful and make sure that the
2:47:11
contrast is not too low be mindful of color choices to ensure that your text is accessible to all users including
2:47:19
with a visual impairments this consideration is essential for creating an inclusive and
2:47:24
userfriendly design I've also made a list of tools I use to make sure that the contrast is always optimal you can
2:47:31
access the list by going to free webdesign course.com /cast all right so now let's talk about
2:47:38
choosing type faces When selecting type faces for the web consider web safe type
2:47:43
faces and web fonts I've made a list of beautiful type faces you can use for your designs
2:47:49
these fonts are free and you can access the list by going to free webdesign course.com freeh
2:47:56
fonts you can also browse some premium fonts I like by going to free webdesign
2:48:01
course.com premium hyen fonts some of these phones might seem uh
2:48:07
very expensive but that's relative because if the budget allows it your client wants them and they elevate the
2:48:13
design they are worth the price and how many type faces should you
2:48:18
use when designing a website the number of type faces you use is crucial for maintaining a clean and cohesive look
2:48:24
using too many type faces can create visual clutter and make your design look unprofessional so here is the general
2:48:31
rule what I recommend is to use one type phase in most cases employing a maximum
2:48:37
of two font Styles within the type phase for more complex designs you can use a maximum of two type faces each with up
2:48:44
to two different font Styles this approach helps ensure consistent and Harmony throughout your
2:48:51
design and this is very important when using textiles uh when using textiles
2:48:56
always keep one text style for better contrast and readability for example if you are using light the other style
2:49:03
should be medium and not regular if you are using regular the other style should be bold and not medium this practice
2:49:09
helps to create a clear hierarchy and avoids confusion sometimes you might consider using the same style or the
2:49:16
next Style with an added underline for emphasis however it's generally better to stick to skipping one style this
2:49:22
technique maintains uh a clean and professional look while providing the necessary visual distinction within your
2:49:28
design now let's talk about where to use these type faces in case you choose to use more than
2:49:34
one for the majority of your design choose a single primary type phas this type phas will be used for the bulk of
2:49:41
your text including body copy headings and subheadings select a type phas that is highly readable and versatile
2:49:47
suitable for or various sizes and weights within this type phase you can use different styles such as regular
2:49:54
bold and sometimes metallic to create visual hierarchy and emphasis if your design requires more
2:50:01
variety you can introduce a secondary type phas use this type face sparingly for emphasis and to create contrast with
2:50:07
the primary type face the secondary type face can be used for specific elements like headings subheadings or highlights
2:50:14
ensure that the secondary type phas complements the primary type phas and aligns with the overall design aesthetic but feel free to break the rules and get
2:50:21
creative within the secondary type phase you can also use up to two different styles to maintain consistency so as a
2:50:28
conclusion understanding the basics of typography is essential for creating effective and engaging web designs by
2:50:34
carefully selecting Ty faes establishing a clear hierarchy and ensuring readability and legibility you can
2:50:40
enhance the user experience and communicate your message more effectively typography is a powerful
2:50:46
tool that when used correctly can sign ific anly impact the overall success of your design project in this lesson
2:50:52
you've learned about the basics of typography readability and accessibility best practices and also where to find
2:50:59
the best type faces now it's time to move to the next lesson in this lesson you will learn how to use Auto layout
2:51:05
and how to create and use components in figma before you start designing the website for the architecture studio in
2:51:12
the next lesson is crucial for you to understand these tools skipping this lesson can lead to the developing bad
2:51:19
design habits making you less efficient mastering these tools will save you a lot of time when editing and updating
2:51:25
websites especially for large projects this knowledge is essential to
2:51:30
become a proficient and effective designer so what is auto layout Auto layout is a feature in figma that helps
2:51:37
you create designs that are flexible and responsive it adjust the position and size of elements automatically based on
2:51:44
the rules you set this means you don't have to manually adjust everything when the design changes it's like magic with
2:51:52
auto layout you can create designs that look good on any screen size whether you are designing for a phone tablet or
2:51:59
computer or a layout makes sure that uh you know your elements stay in the right
2:52:04
place this is especially helpful when designing websites or apps that need to work on different
2:52:10
devices another benefit of order layout is that it keeps your spacing consistent you can set the exact space between
2:52:17
elements and figma will maintain that spacing for you Auto layout makes it easy to
2:52:24
rearrange elements if you need to move an item up or down in the list you can simply drag it and the other elements
2:52:31
will adjust automatically this saves time and keeps your design clean so overall Auto layout
2:52:38
in figma helps you work faster and more efficiently it ensures that your designs are flexible consistent and easy to
2:52:45
update making it an essential tool for any designer I will now make a quick
2:52:51
stepbystep demonstration on how Auto layout Works step number one creating a
2:52:56
frame first let's create a frame by clicking on the frame tool from the toolbar on the top left or by pressing
2:53:04
the F key now I will click and drag to create a frame on the canvas something
2:53:10
like this step number two adding elements to the frame now let's add some
2:53:15
elements to our frame I will start by you know um adding a few rectangles that
2:53:21
represent bonds I will add a unique color shade to each so we can better
2:53:26
identify
2:53:33
them I will also add a background color to the parent
2:53:42
frame step number three applying Auto layout to apply Auto layout simply right click inside the frame then select add
2:53:49
Auto layout you can also press shift plus a as you can see the frame resides
2:53:55
automatically after activating Auto layout but don't worry about that because I will explain it to you in a
2:54:01
moment when we talk about resizing options step number four configuring
2:54:06
Auto layout properties with auto layout applied we can explore the auto layout panel to manage our layout
2:54:13
options these arrows allow us to place items vertically one on top of each
2:54:18
other horizontally side by side or enable wrapping so that when the frame is resized like I'm doing right now the
2:54:26
items inside WRA to the next line the next option is the space between items which is useful for
2:54:32
setting uniform spacing between each item next let's explore the alignment
2:54:39
panel which helps us align the items inside the frame for example to place
2:54:45
all items at the top of the frame click the top alignment op and all items will move to the top you
2:54:51
can also do the same for the other directions if you want the space between
2:54:57
items to be flexible based on the width of the frame double click on the input field and write
2:55:02
Auto or you can simply double click here now all items will be evenly spaced
2:55:09
based on the frames width this also works for vertical layouts spacing items vertically based on the framed height
2:55:16
below that we see the pad option this one allows us to set padding on each
2:55:22
side of the frame we can also add padding on the top or bottom of our frame you can click the small icon and
2:55:28
drag left or right to increase or decrease the padding you can also directly input a number or click on the
2:55:35
lines in the frame and drag in the direction you want this is useful when you don't know the uh exact padding you
2:55:42
want to add if you know the exact padding you can input the number directly let's say we want to add add a
2:55:49
200 pixel padding on each side we can come here and then add 200 and now we
2:55:55
have a 200 pixel padding on each side we can do the same thing uh
2:56:04
vertically with this option and if we want to add you know a
2:56:10
uniform um padding on on you know top bottom left and right we can do it here
2:56:17
by pressing in control and then clicking and then we can add whatever padding we
2:56:23
want like let's say 300 and now we have a 300 pixel padding
2:56:30
on each side step number five adding new elements one of the great features of
2:56:35
Auto layout is how it handles new elements let's add uh another rectangle
2:56:41
to our group simply draw a new rectangle inside the frame and it will automatically adjust to the spacing and
2:56:47
padding you set step number six rearrange Elements Auto
2:56:53
layout makes it easy to rearrange elements if you want to change the order of the buttons just click and drag a
2:57:00
rectangle to its new position the other elements will adjust automatically to maintain the spacing you can also use
2:57:08
the keyboard keys to move the position of the elements like I'm doing right now
2:57:13
step number seven resizing finally let's see how Auto layout response to resizing
2:57:20
Auto layout provides three key resizing options for elements within a frame fi
2:57:25
container fixed and hug when an element is set to fill
2:57:30
container it expands to fill the available space within the parent frame making it useful for creating flexible
2:57:37
layouts where elements need to stretch to accommodate different screen sizes and we can set the resize in vertically
2:57:44
or horizontally and this is how it behaves as you can see the item inside
2:57:50
of the frame stretches or shrinks as we resize the frame the fix option keeps the elements
2:57:56
at a specific size regardless of the parent frame size which is ideal for
2:58:02
elements that need to maintain consistent Dimensions like icons or logos the hug option adjust the element
2:58:10
size to fit its content for example a button with text Will resize to fit the
2:58:16
length of the text making it use useful for dynamic content where the size of the element should adapt to the amount
2:58:23
of content it contains to set these resizing options select an element within the auto layout
2:58:29
frame in the right sidebar right here you will see the resizing settings where
2:58:35
you can choose between field container fixed and hug feel free to practice by
2:58:40
creating some frames and adding shapes inside of them you will be using Auto layout a lot so get familiar with it now
2:58:48
I will talk about the similarities between Auto layout and CSS flexb Auto layout in figma is very similar to CSS
2:58:55
flexb both allow you to create flexible and responsive layout by defining rules
2:59:00
for how elements should be arranged in space just like flexbox or a layout lets
2:59:06
you set a direction alignment and spacing between elements making it easier to design for different screen
2:59:13
sizes when working with developers understanding these similarities can be incredibly beneficial as it allows for
2:59:20
smoother communication and implementation of Design Concepts aoa's properties in figma have similar
2:59:26
counterparts in CSS Flex box for instance fi container in Auto layout is like Flex grow in Flex box in both figma
2:59:34
Auto layout and CSS Flex box setting a fixed width ensures that the element maintains a specific width regardless of
2:59:41
its content or container size and hog is similar to flex bases
2:59:47
set to auto this alignment ensures that designers and developers are on the same page
2:59:53
reducing the likelihood of discrepencies between design and development when you
2:59:58
start applying Auto layout you might wonder how to place an element freely in front of the auto layout frame for
3:00:05
instance if you have a product card and want to add a small circle on top of the
3:00:10
uh right corner that says new how can you do that right don't worry I will show you how to do that in a moment in
3:00:18
SS this can be done using absolute positioning and you can do something very similar in figma when you use this
3:00:24
feature an object is removed from the normal flow of Auto layout but stays
3:00:30
inside the auto layout frame this means that the object won't affect or be affected by closed by elements even when
3:00:37
they resize or move just like in CSS absolute positioning inigma lets you
3:00:42
place an object exactly where you want it inside its parent frame these objects
3:00:48
act like they are in a regular frame so you can set constraints to control how
3:00:53
they behave when the parent frame uh resizes however keep in mind that other
3:00:59
Auto layout features like resizing and advanced layout options don't apply to these objects to use absolute
3:01:06
positioning select an element inside an auto layout frame and click the absolute
3:01:11
positioning icon in the properties panel right here I know all this might be a little bit confusing especially when
3:01:17
when you are a beginner right but as always feel free to ask any questions you have by leaving a comment if you are
3:01:25
watching this on YouTube or by posting your questions in our private Community
3:01:30
now it's time for you to learn about components components are usable elements in figma that help maintain
3:01:36
consistency and efficiency across your designs they can be anything basically
3:01:42
uh from buttons icons and form fields to entire sections of a user interface
3:01:49
by creating a component you define a main version that can be reused multiple times throughout your design project
3:01:55
when you use a component any changes made to the main component automatically update all instances of that component
3:02:03
this is particularly useful for making Global updates across your design saving you a ton of
3:02:09
time all right so let me give you an example we have this product card and we will turn it into a component so to do
3:02:17
that let's select the frame and then right click and then go here and where
3:02:22
it says create component we click we can also create the component through this uh
3:02:28
shortcut now we see this purple outline that is telling us that this is a
3:02:34
component now so now that we have our main component we'll create some instances
3:02:41
and to do that we select the component and then we press alt we maintain alt
3:02:46
pressed and then we drag and we have one instance and then we'll create another
3:02:52
one right here all right so now we have one main component and two instances so
3:03:00
let's see what happens if we change the background color of the main
3:03:05
component let's change the background color you see the background color
3:03:13
changes on all the instances
3:03:20
right let's change the background color back to White and now let's say that we
3:03:26
want to change the color of the buttons right but then we want each button to be a different color you might be thinking
3:03:34
uh that's not possible because if we change the color of this uh main
3:03:39
component it changes the color on all instances right however we can edit and
3:03:47
change the color of each I mean of the elements that are inside of the
3:03:52
instances without affecting the main component and without affecting the other instances so let's change the
3:03:58
color of these uh two instances so you can see what I'm talking about let's change this to
3:04:07
Orange and then let's change this to green and now you might be thinking okay
3:04:14
so now the uh instances are detached from the main component and that's not
3:04:19
what happens because the instances are still linked to the main component the
3:04:25
only thing we made an exception and we changed the color of an element inside of an instance but let's change the the
3:04:32
background color of the of this uh main component right now let's change
3:04:39
it and as you can see they are still linked but the buttons of these
3:04:46
instances are detected from the main component so if we change the background
3:04:52
color of the button of the main component you can see that it doesn't change the
3:04:58
color of these two buttons and that's because these buttons are detach from
3:05:05
this component this way you maintain the flexibility to customize specific
3:05:10
instances while keeping the benefits of using components for consistency and efficiency across your design components
3:05:18
can also have variant which are different states or versions of the same component for example a button component
3:05:25
can have variance for its default hover and active States this allows you to manage
3:05:31
different appearances and interactions within a single component framework you learn about this in module 11 when we
3:05:37
dive into variance in figma so don't worry about variance right now to create
3:05:42
a component select the elements you want to include then right click and choose create component
3:05:49
once created the component will appear in your assets panel right here now you can reuse this component whenever you
3:06:07
want here are some nice tricks you can use if you ever need to reset and edited
3:06:12
instance back to its original state select the instance right click and then choose reset instance this will revert
3:06:20
any changes made to that instance restoring it to match the main component another helpful trick is to swap
3:06:27
instances and there are different ways to do that and I will show you right now so here we have a group of components so
3:06:36
this is a frame and then we have two components right two main components and
3:06:41
here we have two components in the canvas now I will create an instance of
3:06:47
this component so I can show you how it works right so let's say that we want to
3:06:53
change the uh the um you know the version of this instance we want the
3:06:59
dark mode to do it we can just select this instance then go here where it says
3:07:06
swap instance right and then select the dark mode and now we have this
3:07:13
version and this is very helpful because when you start you know these designing with a bigger team and when they have
3:07:20
the components in a separate page you can manipulate uh the page that you are
3:07:26
working on and then swap different instances right and I will show you how it works let's um copy this right and
3:07:34
then paste it here for example now I am in a different page
3:07:39
right so let's say that we want to swap this instance to the light version we uh
3:07:46
right click and then do the same thing and now we have this version right so
3:07:53
it's very very useful let's delete this and go back to
3:07:58
the page one now let's try to do the same thing with this right I will make a
3:08:07
version of the um I mean an instance of this component and then when I try to do
3:08:13
it I don't see the option why is that that's because these are not related
3:08:21
right they are in the canvas and they are not in a I mean inside a frame right
3:08:27
and you might think okay so I can group these together right and create a
3:08:34
group but it doesn't work when they are inside of the of a group right they have to be inside of a frame now if I create
3:08:42
an auto layout frame I press uh I mean press and hold shift a now this is a
3:08:49
frame and now if I want to swap this instance I can all
3:08:58
right and now you might be thinking wow so that's not ideal because now I will
3:09:04
always have to create a frame in order to swap uh instances and not necessarily
3:09:10
because there is a way to do it let me show you I will ungroup this right so
3:09:16
they are back um in the canvas and I will show you again that
3:09:23
it's not going to appear right here the the swap option but then in the
3:09:28
properties panel we have this option and we can use this now to
3:09:34
swap the instances right so they don't have to be inside of a frame you can do
3:09:41
it in a different way but if you want to use the uh right click and then swap
3:09:46
instance right they have to be related so and that means that they have to be
3:09:51
inside of a frame right now you might be thinking why when
3:09:57
I have this instance selected I cannot see this other
3:10:03
instance here right in this swap instance uh I mean panel right I cannot
3:10:09
see it and I cannot search for it or anything because it doesn't exist right here and that happens because as I as I
3:10:17
said before this instance is related to these components right and this instance
3:10:24
is related to uh the components that are inside of this
3:10:29
Frame I will show you an example so you can see how this works all right so let me create a
3:10:37
frame here's a frame I will change the color so you can see it better now I will turn this Frame into a
3:10:45
component and now this Frame uh this component
3:10:51
right belongs to this right it belongs
3:10:56
is related to these two components and therefore it's also um you know in the
3:11:03
same quote unquote family as this instance so now if we select this
3:11:09
instance and we go here we can see this Frame all right because they are related
3:11:19
let's try to swap this into that uh rectangle and it works
3:11:25
right let me change it back to this and now if we try to do the same thing with
3:11:32
this instance it doesn't work right you cannot see this rectangle
3:11:40
here because as I said before they are not related and what happens if we
3:11:48
drag this here so it's it's part of this um of this Frame
3:11:55
right what happens is you can see it here
3:12:00
now because this is related to everything that is inside of this Frame
3:12:08
all right and I know that all this might be a little bit confusing right but um I'm
3:12:16
trying to explain it as best as I can and as always if you have any questions you can let me know in the comments and
3:12:23
I will do my best to answer now let's see what would happen if we create an
3:12:28
instance of this component right here so this is the instance right let me move
3:12:34
this a little bit so doesn't overlap with this all right so and I will change
3:12:40
the color of this instance right so this is the instance of this component
3:12:47
okay and you might be thinking okay so how I know that this is the instance
3:12:53
because maybe you create it and you just forget right you can see it here you know it has a different icon
3:13:02
this is the component and this is the instance okay and you can see how when I
3:13:09
hover you know it's highlighted on the screen all
3:13:14
right so what happens if I try to swap
3:13:20
this into this instance okay because uh the logic says that if uh this is
3:13:26
related to everything that is inside I could be able to switch um this into
3:13:33
this um instance right so no you can't and I will explain you
3:13:39
why right now as I said before this is related to
3:13:45
all the components that are inside of this Frame but not the instances of the
3:13:53
components that are inside of this Frame if I create an instance of this component and then I change the
3:13:59
background color so you can see it better and then let me move this instance here and then I try to swap
3:14:07
this instance right I cannot see this right I cannot
3:14:14
see this instance here I cannot see it here I cannot see it
3:14:21
here I only see this three because this is an instance and this is an instance
3:14:27
so they are not related directly to this instance right here all
3:14:36
right let's now turn this into a component and we will see that it
3:14:42
appears here all right and now we can swap this instance with this component and
3:14:51
now this is an instance of this
3:14:57
component and we can do the same with this rectangle we can turn it into a
3:15:02
component and now we can swap this
3:15:08
instance so it becomes an instance of this
3:15:14
component now that you know how this works create your own figma file and
3:15:19
then create your own components and instances and then try these different features to see how they work you know
3:15:26
because if you want to really Master these options you have to
3:15:32
practice in this lesson you've learned what Auto layout is and how it works and also what figma components and instances
3:15:39
are and how they work as well now let's move to the next lesson in this lesson we will talk about responsive design and
3:15:46
break point Point responsive design is crucial for creating websites that provide a seamless user experience
3:15:53
across various devices by understanding and applying the principles of responsive design you can ensure that
3:15:59
your websites are accessible readable and functional whether viewed on a desktop tablet or smartphone so let's do
3:16:07
a brief introduction to breakpoints what are breakpoints break points are specific screen widths where the layout
3:16:14
of a website changes to provide a better user EXP experience these changes ensure that a
3:16:21
website is usable and looks good on all devices from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors for example on a
3:16:28
desktop you might see a multi column layout while on a mobile device this
3:16:33
might change to a single um column layout for better readability so here
3:16:38
are the most common break points in web design the first one is mobile and these
3:16:44
wids cover most uh smartphones for example 375 pixels is the width of an
3:16:51
iPhone X and next we have the tablet and these widths cover devices like the iPad
3:16:58
for example and these are the widths that cover most standard desktops and
3:17:03
large screens and a lot of people like to design for the uh 1440 pixels um with
3:17:11
but I like also to design for larger screens so a 1920 is a very common one
3:17:17
that um I use because it's a fact that people are getting larger screens so it
3:17:23
makes sense to also think about designing um uh websites that cover more
3:17:29
space of the screen so everything is not so centered right with uh too much space
3:17:35
on the sides um sometimes you design a website and it looks better when it covers a larger um area of the screen so
3:17:44
1920 is um is um you know is one that I use very often so I like to design one
3:17:52
for larg screen so 1920 one for uh you know regular screens that is 14 40
3:17:59
pixels and then I like to design for tablet and then for mobile now let's talk about the main principles of
3:18:05
responsive design I will also talk about some strategies number one fluid and
3:18:10
flexible layout fluid and flexible layout use percentage base width ensuring that elements adjust to the
3:18:16
screen size unlike fixed layouts that use specific pixel width fluid layouts
3:18:22
allow content to reside proportionally to the user screen and here is an example this Frame
3:18:29
is 50% relative to the width of the screen so if we resize the screen we can
3:18:34
see that the frame adapts and remains 50% number two responsive typography
3:18:41
responsive typography ensures text readability on all devices instead of
3:18:46
fixed Spa sizes relative units like M or Ram are used which scale proportionally
3:18:52
with the screen size this means that headings body text and other type of graphical elements will adjust to
3:18:58
different screen sizes improving readability and user experience and here is an example as I resize the screen we
3:19:05
can see that the size of the font changes and adapts uh to the screen
3:19:14
size number three media query media queries are CSS rules that apply Styles
3:19:19
based on device characteristics like width they enable you to create different layouts for different screen
3:19:25
sizes for instance you can use a media query to apply one set of styles for
3:19:32
screens wider than 768 pixels and another for smaller screens ensuring
3:19:39
that your website looks good on all devices and media queries are something
3:19:44
that um you would use in CSS but when I mean us as designers when we design a
3:19:52
website that will be built using webflow or framer for example or any other no code platform we don't have to write the
3:20:00
media queries because the software has options to set the media queries you
3:20:05
know you can set the um minimum width and maximum width within the app and you
3:20:11
don't have to actually uh write the code but I wanted to mention it because this is something that maybe like a developer
3:20:18
will mention and you should know what he's talking about that's why knowing these terms is
3:20:25
important number four responsive versus adaptive responsive design uses flexible
3:20:30
layouts that adapt to the screen size by adjusting elements dynamically adaptive
3:20:36
design on the other hand uses fixed layouts designed for a specific screen sizes switching between them based on
3:20:42
the detected device a combination of both approaches ensures optimal user experience across
3:20:49
all devices with responsive design providing fluidity and adaptive design offering tailor
3:20:55
experiences this is an example and here we have a two column grid right and then
3:21:01
as we resize the screen we can see that it turns into a one column stack and this is adaptive design and the
3:21:08
container of this grid is set to fix so that's why it doesn't it doesn't move
3:21:14
right we have a fix uh with so even though it's adaptive and it changes it's
3:21:20
not it's not flexible in terms of fluidity right and I will show you uh
3:21:26
how it behaves right now when we turn it into relative instead of fixed now you
3:21:32
can see that it's both adaptive and responsive and here is an example so you
3:21:39
can see how beautiful this navigation menu looks when we resize the screen the
3:21:45
flow is absolutely amazing it adapts to the screen size and
3:21:50
as you can see here the menu changes so it's a combination of responsive design
3:21:56
and adaptive design number five the flow on small
3:22:04
screens vertical Cent flow is crucial as it allows users to scroll down smoothly
3:22:09
ensuring that all content is accessible without horizontal scrolling this linear flow makes a reading and and navigation
3:22:17
easier particularly on mobile devices where screen width is
3:22:22
limited and this doesn't mean that you should never use um horizontal scrolling
3:22:28
on mobile devices right you can especially for example when you are designing for an um e-commerce site
3:22:34
right you can use horizontal scrolling in the product page so they can see more photos of the product but the flow has
3:22:42
to be consistent and you have to make sure that it's not a certain change right for example if you are on the
3:22:49
homepage of a website when you are scrolling down you know the user expects to continuing scrolling down but if all
3:22:56
of a sudden there is like in the middle of it a horizontal scrolling pattern it
3:23:01
just interrupts the user behavior and that's um and that's the same thing for uh desktop sometimes you go to a website
3:23:08
and you see that there is a slideshow and you scroll down and you read the text and all of a sudden it doesn't
3:23:14
scroll anymore why because every like all the information is scrolling horizontally now and then goes back to
3:23:22
Vertical scrolling and that's just very confusing number six maximum and minimum values setting maximum and minimum with
3:23:29
values ensures that the content does not become too stretch on large screens or too cramped on small screens these
3:23:35
constraints maintain readability and visual appeal ensuring that the elements stay within an optimal WID range for any
3:23:43
device number seven nested objects using containers to Nest objects provides
3:23:48
better control over the layout and design of web pages this practice allows designers to group related elements
3:23:55
together making it easier to manage and style them consistently nested objects ensure a more organized and maintainable
3:24:02
web structure number eight mobile or desktop first designing mobile first
3:24:08
means starting with the smallest screen size and scaling up ensuring that the essential content and functionality are
3:24:15
accessible on mobile Dev devices desktop first involves designing for larger screens and then adapting to smaller
3:24:21
screens later on so which one is better and the answer is that it depends right
3:24:27
for me personally I prefer to start designing the desktop version and then I design the tablet version and then I I
3:24:34
move to the mobile version right but a lot of designers prefer to start with
3:24:39
mobile first and that's totally acceptable it just depends on your style and what you are more comfortable with
3:24:46
with but at the end of the day as long as you know the um the basics of web design and you know how to design
3:24:52
beautiful and functional website it doesn't matter which approach you choose and finally number nine bit map images
3:24:59
versus vectors bit map images are pixel based and can lose quality when we siiz
3:25:05
and these are suitable for detail photographs for example vectors on the other hand are composed of mathematical
3:25:13
paths and scale perfectly without losing quality these are ideal for Logos and
3:25:20
illustrations using vectors for scalable graphics and bit Maps um for detailed
3:25:25
photos ensures optimal visual quality across all devices and this is important
3:25:31
because seeing a website with you know pixelated icons and we see this a lot
3:25:37
you know very often and um and also for you know illustrations when you go to a
3:25:42
website and you see a very pixelated um illustration is aesthetically very
3:25:49
painful so that's it by applying these principles and strategies you will be able to create responsive designs that
3:25:55
provide an excellent user experience regardless of the device being used in
3:26:00
this lesson you've learned about breakpoints which are the most common breakpoints and also the main principles
3:26:06
and strategies of responsive design in this lesson we'll talk about grid systems grid systems are important
3:26:12
because they help us maintain consistency throughout the entire design by using a grid system we can ensure
3:26:19
that elements are aligned properly which enhances the visual structure and balance of our designs all right so
3:26:25
let's start with the eight-point grid system an eight-point grid system is a design framework where spacing margins
3:26:31
and dimensions are based on multiples of eight pixels this helps maintain consistency and Alignment across the
3:26:37
user interface making it visually harmonious and easier to scale designs across different screen sizes for
3:26:43
example padding and margins will be set to 8 pixels 16 pixels 24 pixels and so
3:26:49
on and what is a fourpoint grid system so this grid system is basically the
3:26:55
same thing as the eight point the difference is that this is based on multiples of
3:27:01
four that means that distances and dimensions increase in steps of four pixels such as four pixels 8 pixels 12
3:27:09
pixels 16 pixels and so on so here is an example in this design we are using the
3:27:15
8o grid system for some elements and then for some other elements we are using the fourpoint grid system all
3:27:20
right and I will show you right now so between this container in this container
3:27:26
we have 80 pixels okay a distance of 80 pixels and
3:27:33
then between this container and this container we have a distance of 120
3:27:40
pixels and this is also a multiple of eight and if we look at the items we can
3:27:47
see that there is a distance of 32 pixels as well so this is a multiple of
3:27:54
eight now if we scroll down and we go here we can see that the uh distance
3:28:00
between each icon is 64 pixels this is a multiple of eight as well so we can see
3:28:07
the consistency here 80 pixels as well all right the bottom 80 pixels as well and
3:28:15
here we can start to see the fourpoint grid system right this is 24 pixels
3:28:20
which is a multiple of four and then here we can see as well how this is 12
3:28:28
pixels multiple of four all right so as you can see there is um you know there
3:28:34
is consistency that's why when we zoom out we can see how everything is
3:28:39
perfectly spaced you know the spacing is not the same for every element right but
3:28:44
um we are using a consistent system that's why when we look at the uh big picture when we look at everything uh
3:28:50
zooming out we can see that everything is very well balanced all right and um
3:28:56
in a in a moment I will uh show you when to use the 8po grid system and when to
3:29:01
use the uh 4o grid system so here is when to use them when we are trying to set a very tight spacing like in this
3:29:08
case we use a fourpoint grid system as you can see here I use four pixels right
3:29:15
and then here as well between these um items I use a 4o
3:29:23
grid system because I want these to be close to each other
3:29:31
right same thing here between this and this we see that it's 12 pixels this is
3:29:38
a 4o grid system as well all right and then here we are
3:29:45
using in a eight point grid system and that's because we are separating into um containers so we want the spacing to
3:29:52
be you know larger right so we are using a 8o grid
3:29:57
system the fourpoint grid system and the 8-point grid system overlab because any
3:30:03
size that fits into the eighto grid system also fits into the fourpoint grid system this is due to the um I mean to8
3:30:10
being a multiple of four for example 80 pixels is a multiple of both four and
3:30:16
eight so it works in both systems however numbers like four and 12 are multiples of four but not eight
3:30:23
fitting only the fourpoint grid system this allows for more precise spacing
3:30:28
adjustments the fourpoint grid offers a finer control while the 8po grid
3:30:33
provides larger more consistent spacing making the design simpler and easier to maintain so in a nutshell we use the 8po
3:30:41
grid system for Simplicity and scalability while the 4o grid system is
3:30:47
useful when uh detail Precision is needed if you are wondering which grid system I prefer I like to use a mix of
3:30:54
both sometimes I prefer tighter spacing between some elements which the 4o grid
3:30:59
system provides however I'm mainly use the 8-point grid throughout the entire design with some exceptions where I use
3:31:06
the fourpoint grid system when working with a team that already has a preferred
3:31:12
system like a fourpoint grid for example I adjust and work within that system at
3:31:17
the end of the day there is no right or wrong way when it comes to grid systems it depends on the context of the design
3:31:22
we are working on here we have icons with sizes of 80 pixels 64 pixels 48
3:31:28
pixels and 32 pixels these sizes work well with both the fourpoint grid system and the 8o grid system the icon sizes
3:31:36
here are multiples of both four and eight this makes the icons easy to use
3:31:41
in designs because they fit perfectly into both grid systems ensuring the design looks clean and consistent so
3:31:48
always size the icons keeping in mind the grid system you are working with when working with typography in web
3:31:53
design using a fourpoint grid system can help create a visually cohesive and consistent layout to apply this system
3:31:59
to text you can choose any phone size you want but you need to make sure that the line height is a multiple of four
3:32:06
for example if you decide on a paragraph on size of 20 pixels the line height could be 24 pixels 28 pixels 32 pixels
3:32:15
and so on however it's important to avoid making the line height too large because an overly spaced line height can make the
3:32:22
text look uh disconnected and harder to read to find the right line height you
3:32:27
could use percentages a good range is between and 12% and 150% of the uh phone
3:32:34
size this means that if your phone size is 20 pixels you could calculate 140% of
3:32:41
20 pixels which gives you a line height of 28 pixels if the line height you
3:32:47
calculate using percentages isn't a multiple of four you could adjust it for instance if you calculate a line height
3:32:54
of 27 pixels which isn't a multiple of four you can round it up to 28 pixels to
3:33:00
fit the fourpoint grid system this way your text remains visually consistent and aligned with all Design
3:33:07
Elements so what's the difference between using a fixed line height and a
3:33:13
percentage using a fixed multiple of four four line height in a fourpoint grid system ensures that all elements in
3:33:20
your design align perfectly creating a clean and organized look this consistency makes it easier to align
3:33:28
text with other Design Elements like images and buttons and uh keeps your layout predictable and scalable across
3:33:35
different devices on the other hand using percentages for line height make sure
3:33:41
that the spacing is always proportional to the phone size which can en
3:33:46
readability for instance a line height that's 140% of the phone size scales
3:33:52
naturally as the phone size changes if instead of using a percentage
3:33:59
we use a fixed number as line height this is what happens when we increase
3:34:04
the size of the uh of the font as you can see the line height
3:34:11
Remains the Same while using fixed multiples of four is is generally better
3:34:16
for maintaining a strict grid alignment slight adjustments for readability are often fine and won't significantly
3:34:23
impact the overall design Harmony so in conclusion the fourpoint grid system in typography involves setting line Heights
3:34:30
and spacing to be multiples of four by using percentages to find a suitable line height and adjusting the nearest
3:34:36
multiple of four you can maintain both readability and visual Harmony in your designs and if you want to use the 8po
3:34:44
grid system in inste it's exactly the same approach but using multiples of eight in this lesson you've learned what
3:34:51
grid systems are and when to use them we've also explore the most popular grid systems such as the fourpoint grid
3:34:57
system and the 8o grid system all right it's about time now that you have a
3:35:02
basic understanding of the main principles of web design we can start designing a website for an architector
3:35:08
Studio this project will allow us to apply those principles in a practical setting focusing on creating a visually
3:35:14
appealing and functional site that showcases the Studio's portfolio attracts potential clients and
3:35:20
communicates the Brand's unique identity so let's dive into the initial steps and
3:35:26
set the foundation for a successful web design project so the first thing we will do is
3:35:33
to create three pages one for the wireframes and components one for the main design and
3:35:39
one for the bin in the wireframe then components page is where we will place our
3:35:45
wireframe and components in the main design page is where we will Design our website and then in the bin page is
3:35:53
where we will place some any elements that we are not using anymore and to create the pages you just
3:36:00
have to come here and then click to add new pages uh since we are using the free
3:36:06
plan we only can create three pages so we have to work with what we have here
3:36:12
we have the copy that we are going to use for the um homepage and then here we
3:36:19
have the brief and you can download these um documents by going to free
3:36:24
webdesign course.com SL Coursey files and you will find all
3:36:32
the files that um you know you will need to design the entire site and if you
3:36:39
prefer to have these inside of figma I also added a link to um you know to the
3:36:44
figma file all right so let's start the first thing we will do is to copy and paste here the wireframe of the homepage
3:36:53
and to do so go to the figma file that contains the wireframes and uh if you don't have
3:36:59
access yet go to um free webdesign course.com SL Coursey files and then you will find
3:37:07
a link to the figma file that contains the wireframes and once you are in the
3:37:12
figma file you can hide the comments by pressing in shift plus C on your keyboard once you have access to this
3:37:19
file go here to the homepage desktop section and then copy this wireframe
3:37:27
which is the homepage uh wireframe all right so copy it and then go to the main
3:37:32
design page and then paste it here right
3:37:38
here now you can make a copy of this Frame uh select the frame and then press
3:37:44
alt on your keyboard and then drag right here and then select everything that is
3:37:51
inside of this Frame and delete
3:37:56
it now the next thing we will do is to change the name of this Frame to desktop hyphen homepage we can
3:38:06
write here wireframe so in the layers spanel we'll be able to separate this
3:38:13
Frame to this Frame the next thing we will do is to create the grid and for
3:38:19
this design we are going to use the 8o grid system and to do so we have to
3:38:24
select this Frame and then go to layout grid and then click
3:38:30
here and now we you will see that uh there is a grid that appears but this is
3:38:35
not what we want so we go back to layout grid and then we select the columns grid
3:38:44
and then we write 12 because we want a 12 column grid and this is how it
3:38:51
looks now that we have the 12 column grid activated we will tweak these
3:38:56
options and I like to change the color of the grid you can change it to any color you want and then we will also set
3:39:04
the margin since we are using an 8o grid system we will set the margin to 40
3:39:10
pixels and then the gut to 32 pixels and this is how it looks now all
3:39:17
right we can see the margin and then we can see the gutter and now we will create the uh
3:39:25
grid style and to do so we select this Frame and then we go
3:39:30
here and then we click these four dots right and then we click the plus sign
3:39:38
create style and then one
3:39:43
second here we click show more options and then we can see that the uh 12
3:39:48
column grid is selected so the name we can name it um desktop grid since this
3:39:55
is the grid we are going to use for the desktop version and then we click create
3:40:00
style and now we have the style created and we can reuse it throughout our
3:40:06
design here is a nice shortcut to turn on and off the grid you can do so by
3:40:12
pressing shift G all right sometimes we need to see the grid so we can see where
3:40:18
are we placing the elements and sometimes we want to turn it off so to
3:40:23
better visualize the design right and as I said shift G and you can turn it on
3:40:29
and off the next thing we will do is to create the header and to do so we will
3:40:36
select this Frame and then inside of it we'll press F and then we'll begin
3:40:42
creating the frame which is going to be the header and then what I like to do is to add a
3:40:49
stroke so I can better visualize where the frame is because if not as you can see if I don't select it I don't know
3:40:55
where is where is um located right and then if I select it right now and then I add a stroke I can better visualize what
3:41:02
is it so this stroke we will remove it later on but for now we'll keep it like
3:41:08
this and to make sure that we stay organized we have to name everything right so this Frame is is going to be
3:41:15
named the header so we have to go here in the layers panel and then we double
3:41:22
click and then we name it header and now that we have our header
3:41:28
created we will start adding the elements inside of it and the first thing we will add is the logo since we
3:41:35
don't have a logo we will just write the architecture and that's going to be our logo for the
3:41:41
website so let's select the frame and then press t on your keyboard and then
3:41:49
write architecture now we can resize
3:41:55
the the font something like 24 pixels
3:42:02
maybe and then we place it right here for now we will keep the logo here
3:42:10
obviously we will move it later on so it's very aligned but for now we can keep it here
3:42:16
and uh the next thing we will do is to go to the brief real quick so we can see which menu items we
3:42:23
have to create so they want a section where they can display images of their
3:42:29
uh past project so that's the work page and then uh the services page and then the
3:42:37
about us page and then a contact page all right so we know which menu items we
3:42:43
have to create we will now make a copy of this text so
3:42:49
we press alt and then we drag and then this will be the menu
3:42:56
items so we change the name to to menu items for now and then we
3:43:01
make a copy this is going to be for uh work then Services then the B us then
3:43:12
contact and now that we have the menu items we will be changing the name of each uh one by one so we select this one
3:43:20
and this is going to be work and then this one is going to be
3:43:27
services and then this one is going to be
3:43:32
Bas and then this one is going to
3:43:38
be contact and now that we have the menu items we will group them into a frame so
3:43:45
we can better align them so we press um control and shift and press this
3:43:51
one and then this one and then this one and this one and then we press shift a
3:43:56
to create the auto layout frame all right so now it's an auto layout frame
3:44:01
and as you can see we can move them since they are group now now we will move these to the right
3:44:08
I will zoom out so you can see to do so we will select this so this is already
3:44:14
selected and then we go to the properties panel right here and then we click this
3:44:20
option align right and then we can see how this now is sorry aligned to the
3:44:30
right and now we will do the same thing for the logo but instead of clicking align right we will click align left
3:44:39
this option and now as you can see the logo is aligned to the left
3:44:47
now let's hide the grid for a moment and to do so remember we press shift
3:44:53
G and we will name this uh frame all right and this is going to be called
3:44:59
navigation menu so we go here and then we call it
3:45:06
navigation menu and then we select the logos frame
3:45:11
and then we change the name to logo
3:45:17
now we will set the spacing for the menu items so let's Zoom a little bit so you
3:45:24
can see it now it's set at 87 pixels so this does not respect the um 8o grid
3:45:32
system right so we will change this to something like 32 pixels and see how it
3:45:41
looks now it's set to 32 pixels and the spacing looks nice for now so we
3:45:49
will keep it at 32 pixels now we will frame every single
3:45:56
menu item so we select it and then right click and then frame selection and then
3:46:02
we do the same thing for this one and then the same thing for this one and the same thing for this
3:46:10
one now you might be wondering why we place each each of these menu items
3:46:17
inside of a frame and we do that because uh this way we will have more control
3:46:22
over the individual parameters of the um of the menu items in case we want to
3:46:28
edit them in the future so I always prefer to frame them individually now we
3:46:33
will give a name to all the individual frames and to do so we go to the layers
3:46:39
panel and then we press shift and then select this one and then maintain shift
3:46:45
and select the last one and now we have all of them selected and now that we have all of
3:46:51
them selected we right click and then we click here where it says rename and then
3:46:57
we will see this screen appear I mean this window right and then we will give
3:47:04
them this name menu item and then we will write um the
3:47:11
dollar sign and then two ends so as you can see it give us a uh number an order
3:47:19
right the number one two three and four and this is a very nice way to organize them so after we set this we uh click
3:47:29
rename and that's it perfectly
3:47:35
named now we'll start adding the other elements of this page and don't worry
3:47:41
too much about the margin right here because we will fix it obviously by uh setting Auto layout on this Frame all
3:47:50
right we will do that later so let's go back to the um
3:47:56
wireframe and see what we have to add now the next thing is the hero text so
3:48:02
let's go to the homepage copy and then let's take it from
3:48:07
here we copy this and then we paste it into this
3:48:13
Frame right here now let's toggle on the grid shift
3:48:20
plus G on your keyboard now let's frame this text and to do so you can select the text and
3:48:27
then right click and then go here where it says frame selection and click or you
3:48:33
can use a uh shortcut which is control press control on your keyboard then alt
3:48:39
then G and now we can see that it's framed and now that we have this Frame
3:48:46
created what do we have to do next yes sir you guessed it we have to add a name
3:48:53
and um there is a shortcut to do that right if you are on a Windows you can
3:48:58
create um I mean you can rename the frame by pressing control on your
3:49:04
keyboard and then pressing R right and then you will see that you can directly rename the
3:49:13
frame and uh if if you are on a MAAC obviously you have to press command and
3:49:18
then R and for this Frame we will uh name it
3:49:25
hero text and I know that you might be
3:49:31
thinking wow like naming all the layers this is like very time consuming but you
3:49:37
will get used to it and I want to make sure that you develop good design habits
3:49:42
because at the end of the day this is going to help help you stay organized especially when you are working with a
3:49:47
team or you are working on a big project when you have an of experience if you
3:49:53
are designing something for yourself or you are doing like a quick project or like a quick landing page or whatever
3:49:59
you don't have to name everything right but it's uh better for you to get used to it because as I said if you want to
3:50:06
systemize your designs for a big project you have to make sure that everything is
3:50:11
uh named now let's convert this Frame into an auto layout frame so while we have this
3:50:18
Frame selected we press shift a on our keyboard and now this Frame is an auto
3:50:24
layout frame and you can know that this is an auto layout frame by looking at
3:50:29
this icon right here now we will change the phone size
3:50:36
because we want this to be bigger all right and to do so we will select the text that is inside of the frame and uh
3:50:43
I will show you a trick when we have elements inside of a frame or we have
3:50:50
nested frames inside of a parent frame to select them we we can um instead of
3:50:56
double clicking like this we can just press control on our keyboard and
3:51:01
directly select the uh item inside of the frame which is faster especially when we have a lot of
3:51:08
layers let me give you an example if we want to reach this text that's inside of
3:51:13
this uh tested frame we would have to uh you know click multiple times like I'm
3:51:19
doing right now and this is the most intuitive way to do it but there is a better way to do it
3:51:25
and it's by moving the cursor until we reach the element we want to select in this case this text and then while we
3:51:32
have the cursor here we can press uh and maintain controll or command on our
3:51:37
keyboard and then we click the element and now as you can see we selected the element and in this way is way more
3:51:43
efficient then just like clicking multiple times especially when we have a lot of nested
3:51:50
frames now you might be thinking what if I want to select this blue frame it's the same thing we press and maintain
3:51:56
control command on our keyboard and then we click and as you can see we selected this Frame and if we want to select
3:52:02
another frame we do the same thing we press and maintain control and then we click as I did with this orange
3:52:09
one now to select frames this way you have to make sure that they have a background color because if they don't
3:52:16
have a background color you cannot select the frames I mean nested frames by pressing controll or command and then
3:52:23
clicking let me show you if we select this blue frame and then we remove the background color as we can see if we try
3:52:31
to select it uh This Way by pressing and maintaining controller command and then clicking it doesn't work right we have
3:52:37
to click multiple times to reach this Frame because it doesn't have a background color when I discover this I
3:52:44
tried an experiment so I selected the frame and then I went to um you know to
3:52:49
add a background color and then I added the background color and then I set the opacity to zero right I tried to be
3:52:57
slick but then it doesn't work for it to work you have to set the opacity to at
3:53:03
least 0.1% and now as we can see it works all
3:53:11
right here are the different ways to select
3:53:18
frame now let's get back to designing the website let's increase the phone size of
3:53:24
these hero text so let's select the text and then here on the properties panel we
3:53:30
change the font size to 40 pixels and let's see how it
3:53:35
looks let's add a space here now let's click outside once and then click again
3:53:42
so we select the parent frame and then we will resize the
3:53:48
frame something like this and then we select the text by pressing control and
3:53:55
clicking and then we will we will set it to field
3:54:01
container all right now let's set the line height of this text to
3:54:10
120% which is going to be exactly the same but in case we decide to resize it
3:54:16
later on is going to be consistent right it's going to be 120% relative to the font
3:54:22
size now we will add the next element which is going to be this U title that
3:54:28
says work let's do it by clicking inside of the frame and then pressing t on our
3:54:35
keyboard and then clicking and then writing work and now we will resize it probably
3:54:43
something like uh 200 pixels for now and then let's place it right
3:54:50
here let's Center it a little right
3:54:55
here let's frame it by selecting it and then pressing Control Alt
3:55:01
NG and now let's change the name so
3:55:07
let's change it to
3:55:12
title we can remove move this stroke already so we select it and then here in
3:55:18
the properties panel where it says stroke we click right
3:55:24
here now let's add the next section which is going to be this section right
3:55:29
here this is going to be our featured project so let's create a frame
3:55:42
here now we can name this Frame image
3:55:52
container now let's add an image inside of this Frame to do so let's select the frame and then add a rectangle inside so
3:56:00
let's press r on our keyboard and then let's draw a rectangle something like
3:56:06
this let's uh toal Off the Grid so we can see it
3:56:12
better now let's select the frame and then we should uh convert this Frame
3:56:19
into an auto layout frame so while we have it selected let's press shift
3:56:26
a now let's select the rectangle that's inside and then let's go to the properties panel and then set this to
3:56:34
field container now let's go back to the frame and select the frame and then let's
3:56:41
remove any padding that we have here so let's set it to
3:56:49
zero now as we can see the rectangle fits perfectly the
3:56:54
frame now let's add our desired image so to do that we have to select the
3:57:01
rectangle and then go here uh in the properties panel and then click here
3:57:06
where it says fill and then select the uh image option and then we click here where it
3:57:13
says choose image now we will see this window pop up and then we choose our
3:57:18
image in this case is this one we double click and then here we
3:57:24
have our image perfectly placed now let's activate the
3:57:30
grid to make sure that this is centered so we will resize this Frame and to do
3:57:37
so we have the frame selected and then we uh go here to one of the corners and then while we press and maintain shift
3:57:45
we resize it let's Zoom to make sure that this is
3:57:52
perfectly aligned with the grid if not we can just resize it a little bit
3:57:57
more and then go to the other Corner okay this is perfect we can
3:58:05
toggle off the grid for now now let's resize the frame so instead of the size
3:58:13
we can set it to 800 so it's more even that was for the
3:58:18
height the width is perfect already now let's say that we want to move the image
3:58:23
a little bit to the right or to the left we can do it by selecting the image and then going here in the properties panel
3:58:30
where it says image and then click in here and now we see that it's set to
3:58:36
fill we can change it to cop Now using the keyboard we can move
3:58:42
it to the right or to the left we can also use the mouse
3:58:48
but with the keyboard it's more precise now let's change the name of the image to do so let's press control and
3:58:54
then click to select the image and then now we press control again and R and
3:59:00
then we change the name let's write something like featured Project
3:59:09
image now we will add the project name and location here so let's toggle on the
3:59:15
uh grid again now we will add here a placeholder for the project name and location so
3:59:23
let's press t on our keyboard and then let's write something like this project
3:59:28
name and then location this is a m Dash but you can
3:59:36
use a comma if you want now let's resize these text to 24
3:59:47
pixels now let's select this and then this right so this text and this Frame
3:59:55
and we will create an auto layout frame so let's press shift
4:00:01
a and now while we have this Frame selected let's change the name so let's press control or command plus r on our
4:00:09
keyboard and then let's rename it to something like fature
4:00:15
project
4:00:22
card now let's change the spacing here so we click here and
4:00:29
then we can set it to 40 pixels remember a multiple of
4:00:36
eight and it looks good now let's toggle Off the Grid so we can
4:00:42
see how the site is looking all
4:00:50
right and now let's modify this text because I don't really like it how it looks so centered I prefer it if it's uh
4:00:57
full width you know and it's aligned with this image and this uh navigation
4:01:03
menu I mean this header so let's do it let's reactivate the
4:01:10
grid and then let's resize this so it's aligned with the Heather and all the
4:01:15
content that's below let's toggle Off the Grid so we
4:01:21
can better see it and now it looks so much
4:01:29
better now the spacing looks a little bit off I mean very off I would say but
4:01:35
we will fix it because we will uh activate Auto layout to this Frame and
4:01:41
then we will set the um the space so it's aligned with the 8o grid system and
4:01:47
everything will look very well balanced now let's create these project
4:01:52
cards and then we will do the same with did to create this
4:01:57
one so let's reactivate the
4:02:03
grid and then we click here inside of this Frame and then we will create
4:02:08
another frame here now let's press F on our keyboard and then let's create a frame frame something like this for
4:02:20
now now while we have these frame selected let's add a
4:02:29
stroke now let's click inside of the frame and then press the r key and let's
4:02:34
draw a rectangle like
4:02:41
this let's deactivate the grid and now we will do the same thing we did
4:02:47
here so we select the frame then press shift a to convert it to an auto layout
4:02:54
frame now while we have the frame selected we go to the properties panel
4:03:00
and then remove any padding we have here so we set this to zero and then this to
4:03:07
zero now let's rename the frame to image
4:03:16
container now let's select the image and then let's go here to the properties panel and we will do the same thing we
4:03:23
did before we click and then we select image and then we choose our image which
4:03:31
in this case it's going to be this one project two so we double click and we
4:03:37
have our image here now let's select the frame and then
4:03:42
let's make sure that it's aligned with the grid so let me zoom and then let's
4:03:47
move it
4:03:53
here now let's resize the image so let's select the image so remember control or
4:03:58
command and click once then go to the properties panel and then make sure that
4:04:04
this is activated you know to make sure that the aspect ratio Stills the same
4:04:09
and here we add a height of 800 pixels and then let's go back to the
4:04:17
image now let's select the image so remember control or command plus click
4:04:23
and then you will select the image that it's inside of the uh frame and then let's resize it we can do that manually
4:04:29
so let me zoom and let's resize it so it's aligned with the
4:04:38
grid right here let let me zoom
4:04:47
out now let's add here the project name and location so let's press t on our
4:04:53
keyboard and then write name and
4:05:00
location and then let's resize these two 24
4:05:06
pixels and then while we have this selected we press and maintain shift
4:05:11
then click this Frame and then we activate Auto layout shift
4:05:18
a now let's change the space in here to 40
4:05:29
pixels remember that you can also change the spacing by going to the properties panel right here I just prefer to uh you
4:05:38
know sometimes change it directly in the um here right here
4:05:45
and now let's change the name of this Frame and then the image so this time we can just go here and then change the
4:05:52
name to project card and then we will
4:05:57
change the name of the image to Project
4:06:05
image now let's toggle Off the Grid to see how it's
4:06:12
looking nice now we'll reactivate the grid and then
4:06:18
we will make a copy of this so we have one 2 3 4 five so we have to make five
4:06:25
copies and then on each copy we will change the image so what we will do is to create a
4:06:33
component so we will transform this to a component and then we will make six
4:06:39
copies and we will move this to a different page so we will move it here
4:06:46
our page for the wireframes and components and then here we will have all the
4:06:52
instances so let's move this Frame and then turn it into a component let's
4:06:58
select the frame and then press control or command X on our keyboard to cut it
4:07:03
and then let's go to this page and then we can paste it
4:07:09
somewhere here it's fine for now
4:07:14
now let's select the frame and then let's turn it into a component Let's uh right
4:07:19
click and then here where it says create component we
4:07:25
click and now as we can see this Frame is a
4:07:33
component now let's go back to the main design page and then here where it says assets
4:07:42
it's where we you will see all our components right so this is the component that we need we click and then
4:07:49
here where it says instant I mean insert instance click again and now we have the instance here
4:07:57
so what we have to do is to move it inside of the frame right and then let's
4:08:03
reactivate the grid and then let's place it where it's supposed to
4:08:10
be right here and now we will make five copies of this
4:08:16
instance so we select the instance and then we press and maintain alt on our keyboard and then we make a
4:08:22
copy we place it here for now and then we make another
4:08:27
copy and then another one and then another
4:08:34
one and then another one and now we can change the images on
4:08:42
each of these instances without affecting the uh parent component right
4:08:47
so let's do that let's select the image that's inside of this instance so control and then click and then go here
4:08:54
in the properties panel and then we do the same process we did before here in this folder we have all
4:09:01
the images we need in this case is Project 3 right here and let's do the same with
4:09:08
all these other instances now we have all the images we need let's toggle off
4:09:14
the GD so we can better see the website and now this is starting to look like a
4:09:20
real website the beauty of using components and instances is that for example let's let's go to this page and
4:09:28
then let's add a background color and then change the text um color as well
4:09:35
let's see maybe a black background and then let's change the
4:09:42
text to White if we go back to the main design
4:09:48
page we can see that it changes on all the
4:09:56
instances so imagine that we have like hundreds of instances right in a project
4:10:03
and then the client says Hey I want to change the background color to a different color right if we have to do
4:10:10
it manually on every page it it's very very time consuming but if we have
4:10:16
components and then instances It's very effective and efficient let's go back to
4:10:22
the components page and then let's remove the background
4:10:28
color and then let's change the text to Black again and then let's remove the uh
4:10:35
stroke that we added when we created this Frame so let's select this
4:10:41
Frame and then let's remove this stroke and now this stroke is going to
4:10:48
be removed from all the instances of this component as we can see there is no stroke
4:10:57
anywhere what I like to do is to modify the pairing component as well so I can
4:11:03
better identify it so let's select the image control or command click and then
4:11:09
let's go here and then select solid
4:11:17
now let's go back to the main design
4:11:22
page as we can see here when we change the image to a solid color on the main component it also change on this
4:11:29
particular instance and that's because since the main component already had the image we needed on this instance we kept
4:11:37
it and didn't override it like we did on the other instances to fix this we can select the image go to the properties
4:11:44
panel right here click on image and choose our desired image in this case
4:11:50
it's going to be this one now if we go to this
4:11:56
page we can see how everything is set correctly now now it's time to add the next
4:12:03
section or element and it's going to be the CTA and the CTA it's uh going to be
4:12:09
a link uh it could be a button but I prefer to add a link for the for this uh
4:12:15
CTA particularly and um it's going to be a link that will take us to the um
4:12:21
projects page basically page where we will uh feature every single project
4:12:27
that this studio has done to add the CTA let's create a text and then let's write
4:12:33
more projects now let's resize this to 80 pixels because I want it to be large
4:12:40
right then let's set the line height to
4:12:48
120% now let's select it and then move it to the center right here now let's add this
4:12:55
arrow and uh you can find this icon inside of the icons folder and um here's
4:13:02
the URL so you can access this folder and then import the arrow let's drag the
4:13:09
arrow here and then now we will resize it so while we have the icon selected let's
4:13:16
go to the properties panel and then let's activate this to maintain the aspect ratio and then let's resize it to
4:13:22
96 pixels now let's move it
4:13:28
here now we will select the arrow and then we will press and maintain shift and select the text as well now we will
4:13:35
add these two elements to an auto layout frame by pressing shift plus
4:13:40
a now let's move it to the center enter now let's change the spacing here
4:13:48
to 48 pixels a multiple of eight now let's
4:13:55
zoom out and see how it looks it looks good now let's rename this Auto layout
4:14:02
frame we can name it CTA Lin like this it's
4:14:11
fine the next section we have to create is the footer so let's extend a little
4:14:17
bit this Frame so we have more space and then let's add a
4:14:25
frame here let's activate the grid so we can
4:14:33
better see it and then let's add a stroke to this Frame
4:14:45
let's rename the
4:14:55
footer now let's add the um elements inside of the footer so it's going to be
4:15:01
very minimal I like to keep a uh copyright notice here on the left side
4:15:07
and then the legal note and uh you know privacy policy here
4:15:13
let's do
4:15:19
it now let's resize it to 20
4:15:27
pixels and let's place it here for now now let's make a
4:15:35
copy and then we write legal note then we make another copy and we
4:15:44
right privacy
4:15:50
policy let's Zoom this a little bit all right so now let's uh let's make
4:15:57
another copy and this is going to be contact now let's select this and this
4:16:05
and then let's move it to the right and then let's create an auto
4:16:11
layout frame while we have these two selected now let's frame
4:16:18
this and then let's frame this as
4:16:24
well so this is an auto layout frame and
4:16:29
then this one and this one are just regular frames and I will explain why I did this
4:16:37
right now I converted this into an auto layout frame because because these are related
4:16:44
and they are going to be positioned here on the right side and then this is going
4:16:49
to be positioned in the center of the frame and then this one is going to be positioned here on the left
4:16:55
side now let's resize this Frame so it's aligned with the
4:17:03
grid like this now while we have this Frame
4:17:09
selected let's convert it into an auto frame shift Plus okay and now let's uh
4:17:15
resize it and then let's move it now let's go to the properties panel
4:17:22
while we have this Frame selected and then let's remove the padding on the sides let's set it to zero and then this
4:17:30
padding we will set it to 40 pixels multiple of eight and then here we will select a line Center and then we will
4:17:37
double click so the space in between items is set to auto
4:17:43
now let's go back to the grid let's select this Frame and then let's set the
4:17:49
spacing and we will use the same spacing we used here so 32 pixels let's go back
4:17:57
to the bottom and then let's select this Frame and then let's let's change it
4:18:04
to 32 pixels
4:18:11
32 now as we can see everything is perfectly
4:18:22
aligned now let's rename these frames this one is going to be the
4:18:29
copyright so we write copyright here and then this one is going to be
4:18:41
contact and then this one is going to be boring pages I like to call them boring
4:18:48
Pages because they are very boring only text so you can name them like whatever
4:18:54
you want now let's toggle Off the Grid and
4:19:01
then let's select this Frame and then let's remove this
4:19:08
stroke and now our page is almost completed
4:19:15
I just notice an oversight and it's that all these uh components are not inside of this Frame all right as we can see
4:19:22
let's select them as we can see here they are not inside of this Frame but it's fine we
4:19:29
can just uh select all of them and then drag them inside of the
4:19:34
frame that's it things like this can happen all the time because we are human
4:19:39
right that's why it's very important to always double check everything and make sure that every little oversight or
4:19:45
mistake is corrected now we'll create different sections with auto layout before activating the aut layout on this
4:19:52
uh main frame and we will do that because we want to make sure that we can set different spacing between sections
4:19:59
with aut layout we can't add individual spacing between the items inside to achieve this we have to create nested
4:20:05
frames and that's exactly what we are doing let me show you what I mean let's
4:20:10
activate a layout on this Frame as we can see the spacing between all
4:20:18
the sections is the same right so we cannot set individual spacing between
4:20:24
all these elements and sections let me go
4:20:31
back now let's organize this so let's select all these instances and then
4:20:36
let's create an auto layout frame so now this is an auto layout frame and then we will change the
4:20:43
name to nested RX
4:20:53
container now we will select this Frame and then press a maintain shift and select this Frame and then create an
4:21:00
auto layout frame now let's rename this Frame and we
4:21:06
can call it also nested project container
4:21:19
now let's select this Frame and then press a maintain shift and select this Frame and then let's create an auto
4:21:24
layout
4:21:29
frame now let's change the name of this Frame to parent
4:21:36
projects container
4:21:42
now let's set the spacing for each of these sections and this and also
4:21:51
here always respecting the 8po grid
4:21:56
system here we will add a padding of um 72 multiple of eight as well and then
4:22:05
here 64 and then here as well
4:22:17
64 now we have a very nice spacing so just say recap here is
4:22:26
72 then 64 then 64 all
4:22:33
right now let's set the space between these cards all right to
4:22:41
Auto so let's go to the properties panel and then double click
4:22:51
here now let's select this Frame and then press shift and then
4:22:58
select this Frame and let's create an auto layout
4:23:03
frame now let's rename this Frame to projects
4:23:10
section like this and now let's resize this space to 160
4:23:19
pixels multiple of eight now this section is perfectly
4:23:26
spaced now let's set the space in between these frames and then these
4:23:32
frames to do so let's select this Frame and then this Frame and let's convert them into an oral layout
4:23:40
frame now let's set the spacing this to 144
4:23:52
pixels and now let's select this Frame that we just created and then this one
4:23:57
and convert them into an aut layout frame and now let's set this space in to
4:24:03
144 pixels as
4:24:09
well now let's go to the footer then select this Frame and this Frame
4:24:15
and convert them into an aut layout frame and then we will set this to 200
4:24:22
pixels now let's rename the auto layout frames we created so this one we can
4:24:28
name it um container and then the other one we will name it
4:24:35
container as well now let's select our main frame
4:24:42
frame and let's convert it into an auto layout frame as
4:24:49
well and now let's set the padding on all sides to 40 pixels to do so we go to
4:24:56
the properties panel and then we uh right here we press control or command
4:25:02
and then we click and then we write 40 pixels and now we have a 40 pixels
4:25:08
padding on all sides now we have the homepage completed but
4:25:16
we have to tweak some stuff to make the ux better and also to make it look better and one of the things I like to
4:25:23
work on is the navigation menu there are a lot of different types of navigation menus for example a popular one is a
4:25:30
fixed navigation bar that stays visible at the top of the screen uh while you scroll down the page this design is
4:25:37
commonly used for a website's main navigation menu ensuring that it's always visible
4:25:42
however in my opinion it takes too much screen space especially on small devices
4:25:49
so I prefer to hide the menu when users scroll down and show it again when they scroll up this keeps the screen clean
4:25:56
and uncluttered while still providing easy access to the navigation menu you can see this approach in action on the
4:26:03
courses website free webdesign course.com as you can see here the navigation disappears when I scroll down
4:26:10
and it appears when I scroll up this WS the user because they think they have to
4:26:15
scroll all the way up to get back to the navigation menu but they don't so it's
4:26:21
awesome now let's go back to the design file okay so I'm adding a background
4:26:26
color to the navigation menu to ensure that when it appears as the user Scrolls up all the menu items are clearly
4:26:33
visible this prevents overlap with the content behind it avoiding a messy design and making the menu easier to
4:26:40
read I believe this is is an elegant solution for maintaining a clear and functional design let's do it let's
4:26:47
select this Frame and then go to the properties panel then we can add a
4:26:52
placeholder color like something like this for
4:26:58
now and then right now I will go to the mood board and then I will pick a uh
4:27:04
blue shade from here because remember that in the um in the brief we
4:27:12
have here one second you see here it says you could
4:27:20
also add some shades of blue or other C color so we will since we have in the
4:27:26
mood board some nice shades of blue we Will leverage that so let's create a
4:27:37
rectangle right here something like this this and then
4:27:43
while we select the rectangle we go to the properties panel and then here we
4:27:50
select the Color Picker and then we see here in the mood
4:27:57
board if we can find a nice shade of blue something
4:28:05
like like this is fine now we have this shade of blue but
4:28:12
then this is too dark so we will make it a little bit lighter so we go back to the here to the properties panel and
4:28:20
then we slide this to make it very
4:28:27
light um let me see let's try the shade of blue and see
4:28:33
let's move this right here next to the homepage
4:28:42
now let's select this Frame right and then let's go to the properties panel and click
4:28:50
here and then let's select the Color Picker and then while we have this
4:28:57
selected we click here inside of the
4:29:03
rectangle and now we have the color apply here now let's apply some styling let's
4:29:11
go to the the properties panel and then here on the auto layout
4:29:17
panel We'll add a padding of um I mean uh on the sides of 30 pixels and see how
4:29:25
it looks okay now let's go back to the properties panel and then top and bottom
4:29:32
of 20 pixels let's see how it looks all right now let's apply Auto
4:29:40
layout to this this Frame all right to the Heather shift
4:29:47
a and then let's go back to the properties panel and then let's align this to the
4:29:58
center now that I'm looking probably let's select the navigation menu and
4:30:03
let's change the height because I believe that giving it a padding of 30 pixels as well would make it look nicer
4:30:12
so let's go to the wer panel and then let's do 30 pixels here as
4:30:23
well all right now let's um change
4:30:28
the Border radius because like this it looks sharp for some designs it works
4:30:35
but I prefer to add some Corner radius when I do this type of navigation menus
4:30:42
so let's select the frame and then go to the properties panel right here and then
4:30:48
here where it says Corner radius we we can do we can give it a uh 10 as border
4:30:57
radius and let's see it looks
4:31:03
nice as you probably notice the design of this navigation menu is exactly the
4:31:09
same I use to design the free web design course 's website and that's because it
4:31:14
works very well all right so before completing the page I was looking at the
4:31:19
navigation menu and I think that adding a different spacing would be better so
4:31:26
now it's set to 32 pixels let's change it to 48 which is also a multiple of
4:31:35
8 let's see yeah now it looks better
4:31:42
now we can remove this rectangle and then let's set some color styles because this color blue for
4:31:48
example we can add it as a style so let's go here in the properties panel
4:31:53
let's click here and then this plus sign click here and then let's select
4:32:00
style and now we can add a name probably like blue and then click here where it
4:32:08
says create Style
4:32:15
and now as you can see here when the color is applied we can see the color
4:32:23
name now let's do the same thing with the color black so let's select this
4:32:30
Frame and then let's go to the properties panel here and we can see
4:32:36
that we we have two Shades of Black we have this which is a very dark gray and
4:32:42
then this which is pure black and we want to make sure that everything like all the text is set to this uh very dark
4:32:51
black so we are not using the um you know the pure black and to do that we simply click
4:32:57
here and then we write 10 10 10 and now
4:33:03
all the text in this page is using this
4:33:09
color and now we'll create a St the same thing we did with the light blue so we click here and then we click
4:33:17
here and then style and then we we can
4:33:22
call this black and then create as you can see now we have the
4:33:29
light blue and the black and then we can do the same thing with the white as well and then
4:33:36
style white and then create style and now this are the three colors we are
4:33:43
using for this design now the desktop version of our
4:33:49
homepage is done the next step is to create the next uh breakpoint and the
4:33:56
next breakpoint is the tablet version so we will create the tablet version and
4:34:01
then we'll create the mobile version so let's start let's press F on our keyboard and
4:34:08
then let's draw a frame something like this we set the with right now so while
4:34:13
we have the frame selected we go to the properties panel and then on the width
4:34:20
we change it to 810 and this is going to be the break
4:34:26
point for tablet now let's rename this
4:34:36
Frame to tablet homepage and then now we can stretch
4:34:42
it like this for now now let's create the grid for the
4:34:48
tablet so let's select the frame and then go to layout grid here and then
4:34:54
click and then we click here and then we set it to columns and then this one is
4:35:02
is going to be an eight column grid then I will change the color to
4:35:08
blue and then the margin we can still use a 40 pixel margin and then the
4:35:15
gutter 32 pixels now we'll copy some elements from
4:35:22
here and we will add them here and the first thing we will copy and paste is the um header so we select the header
4:35:30
and then we press control or command C and then we select this Frame and then
4:35:36
control or command V and now as we can see we have the header here
4:35:43
now let's resize it so it fits the
4:35:50
grid and let's deactivate the grid for now and as we can see the menu is just
4:35:57
like a little bit too close to the logo so we have to fix
4:36:04
this and what I often do to fix this is basically to change the navigation menu
4:36:10
and instead of having the entire menu displayed I prefer to add a quote
4:36:15
unquote hamburger menu and I say uh quote unquote because it's not your
4:36:21
typical hamburger menu and I will show you exactly what I do so I will select these um menu items
4:36:29
and I will delete all of them and then here I will write
4:36:38
menu now let's select the text of the inside of this Frame so this is the menu
4:36:44
item frame so we select the actual text and then we go to the properties panel
4:36:50
right here and then we Center the text now we have it perfectly
4:36:58
centered now let's reactivate the grid and then let's zoom
4:37:03
out all right now we will add some more elements
4:37:09
and then remember that the p ping at the top and then the bottom is going to be
4:37:14
applied later let's select this Frame that contains the hero text and then we
4:37:20
copy it select the tablet uh frame and then paste it and then let's move it
4:37:26
here around here and then let's activate the grid
4:37:31
and then let's resize it let me zoom in so we can better see
4:37:38
it now let's deactivate the grid for a
4:37:44
moment let's change the text size so let's select the text and then go to the
4:37:49
properties panel and then let's set it to 36
4:37:59
pixels now that the text is set to 36 pixels I see a design problem and it's
4:38:07
this um this is called the rag and it's basically this curve that we are seeing here this is like so
4:38:15
just think as an like imaginary curve right here this is not good it doesn't
4:38:21
look good right so we might change the text to maybe let me
4:38:27
see 32 pixels and now this looks way
4:38:35
better now that we are copying everything to the tablet version we can
4:38:40
see that all the layers are named so that's
4:38:46
the beauty of of this right that we don't have to name everything
4:38:51
again okay let's continue copying this now we will select this uh frame and
4:38:58
then we'll copy it here we move it here here for now it's
4:39:05
fine and then we will change the size as well let's select the text and then here
4:39:12
we can change it to 160 and then let's Center
4:39:23
it we didn't have the auto layout activated on this Frame but let's do it now so while we have the frame selected
4:39:30
let's press shift a and then let's do it on this Frame as
4:39:36
well now let's go to this Frame and let's remove the the padding so whatever
4:39:42
padding you have here set it to zero and now let's Center
4:39:50
it now let's select and copy this
4:39:57
Frame and then we select this Frame and then paste it
4:40:04
here now you will see and appreciate the beauty of aut layout so let's go to this
4:40:09
uh frame and then and we select this Frame which is this one the image
4:40:15
container and then we go to the properties panel and then here instead of fixed we select field container and
4:40:23
we click and then now we click outside and then we select this Frame which is the
4:40:30
uh feature project card and then we resize it here in this
4:40:37
corner and then we press and maintain shift and then let's reside size and as you can see it resizes
4:40:46
perfectly now let's reactivate the grid and then let's see we select the
4:40:53
frame we press and maintain shift and then we align it with the
4:40:59
grid and then here is already aligned so
4:41:04
perfect now let's resize this text to 18 pixels
4:41:13
no actually 20 20 let's set it to
4:41:18
20 now let's change the phone size of this menu item because this um you know
4:41:25
the project name and the location is 24 pixels I mean 20 pixels so this has to
4:41:30
be also 20 pixels because here we are you know we set these menu items to 24
4:41:39
pixels and then and the project name and location here is 24 pixels as well so we
4:41:45
want to keep the consistency and before we change the size of this text we will activate aut
4:41:53
layout on this Frame and I will show you why right now if we don't have our layout
4:41:59
activated on this Frame when we select the text and we change the size as we can see is not aligned to the center and
4:42:07
then we'll have to go here and then you know align it and you know all that
4:42:12
stuff right let me go back so the best approach is to activate Auto layout on
4:42:18
this Frame right which is this Frame okay and
4:42:24
then change the size select the text and then change the size to 20
4:42:30
pixels and as we can see the text is perfectly
4:42:37
aligned now before I forget I will also add Auto layout on each of these frames
4:42:46
all right each of these so this one this one this one and this
4:42:57
one it's important to activate aut layout on elements early in the design because imagine if we had like tens or
4:43:05
hundreds of pages right if we didn't have a layout activated and we didn't set you know create comp component we
4:43:12
would have to go to every page one by one and then set the auto layout
4:43:17
elements and or change do whatever changes we want to do and that would be
4:43:22
very time consuming so make sure that you activate Auto layout before you finish designing the first Pages ideally
4:43:29
the first page now we'll add these project cards to the tablet breakpoint
4:43:36
and to do that we have to just go to any of these um instance
4:43:42
this one for example and then we copy it we select the tablet homepage frame and
4:43:48
then we paste it here as we can see this is already an
4:43:55
instance attached to a component so we have to detach it and to do that we can just right click and then here where it
4:44:03
says detach instance we click here and now as we can see it's already detached
4:44:10
because we are seeing this blue
4:44:15
outline now let's tole on the grid and then we have to resize this card right
4:44:22
if we try to do it it's not going to work let me let me show you right
4:44:27
because this image inside is set to fixed as we can see if we select it here
4:44:33
in the properties panel it's set to fix so we have to change it to field container and this field container as
4:44:40
well and now we have to also select this uh frame the image container and then
4:44:48
change the property to fi container as well and now if we try to resize this
4:44:55
Frame it's going to
4:45:04
work then we will copy this and then paste it to the components page and then
4:45:09
create a component and then create instances but that's very timec consuming right and we are all about
4:45:16
efficiency so I will show you a better way to do it let's delete this
4:45:23
one now let's go to the components page and then here where we have our
4:45:32
component we will select the image which is this
4:45:38
Frame I mean this layer right right we will go to the properties panel and then
4:45:43
we will set it to fi container and then fill container and now we will select this
4:45:51
Frame the image container and then we will do the same thing we will go here in the properties
4:45:57
panel and we can see this one is set to fix we will change it to fi
4:46:04
container and now if we go to the main design page and then we copy
4:46:11
this instance let's copy it and then we
4:46:16
paste it here and then we try to resize it we can
4:46:24
see how it resizes perfectly now let's make sure that the size of the frame aligns with the
4:46:31
grid let's resize it by pressing and maintaining shift and then resize it
4:46:38
like this now it's time to copy and paste the
4:46:44
other instances so we select this instance and then we go to the tablet
4:46:50
and then we paste it here and it's basically the same process we resize it by maintaining
4:47:00
shift and now this is perfectly aligned with the grid
4:47:10
before we continue I will add a project name and a location to all these
4:47:16
instances I will just make it up so it looks more realistic all right so I have added the
4:47:24
project names and the locations here as
4:47:30
well you can use the same ones I used or you can just you know uh choose any
4:47:35
project names and locations you want now copy the rest of the instance say right
4:47:42
these four here and do exactly what I did here and make sure that the font
4:47:48
size is set to 20 pixels now we have all the project cards here let's uh toggle
4:47:54
Off the Grid so we can better see everything and as we can see there are
4:47:59
some misalignments here for example you see this image and this image and that's because this text has two lines and
4:48:08
there are different ways to fix it and we will fix it by adding um I mean
4:48:15
instead of writing here Norway for example we will do the same thing we did here right and then we will
4:48:24
write nor in this case and then
4:48:32
here like this and then Australia
4:48:43
this and then here the same
4:48:50
thing okay so here we can like
4:48:57
this and now everything is perfectly aligned now let's add the next element
4:49:03
which is this the CTA so let's copy the entire frame frame
4:49:11
and then select this Frame and then paste
4:49:18
it let's move it up a little
4:49:24
bit and then now it's time to resize it let's resize it
4:49:30
to 60 pixel you see
4:49:39
maybe 50 pix let's
4:49:46
see 60 pixels I think is better yes let's keep it at 60 pixels
4:49:55
and now we have to resize this and we can resize it
4:50:00
to 80 pixels but we have to make sure that this is activated you know the uh
4:50:06
to keep the same aspect ratio so now we can set it at 80
4:50:14
pixels and now it looks good now let's add the footer this
4:50:24
section and before adding it we'll create a component and we'll create a component for the header as well and
4:50:31
we'll do that because the footer and the navigation menu will be repeated multiple times throughout the
4:50:38
website so let's select the Heather and then let's copy it and go to
4:50:44
the components page and then let's paste it somewhere
4:50:49
here let's move it up a little right
4:51:01
here and now let's create the component so we select the frame and then we right
4:51:08
click and then here where it says create component we
4:51:13
click and now we have our component and we'll do the same thing with the footer
4:51:20
so we go to the main design page and then
4:51:26
we select copy and paste the footer let's go back to the components
4:51:33
page and then let's paste it here let's move it up
4:51:41
and then let's convert it into a
4:51:50
component now we'll do the same thing with the tablet and mobile header so let's go to the main design page
4:51:57
again then we go to the tablet version
4:52:02
then we copy this then go to the components page and then we paste it
4:52:09
here let's let's move it down a little and now let's convert this into a
4:52:16
component the next step is to copy each one of these to the main design page so
4:52:21
let's start with the header for the desktop version and then we copy it we go to the main design page and then here
4:52:29
we double click right here so we are inside of the frame and then we paste it
4:52:35
now it's going to be pasted here at the bottom but what we can do is to basically just drag
4:52:43
it right we drag it
4:52:48
here you can also use the keyboard to change the position of the header now we
4:52:54
select this one and then we remove it and now we have the instance of the
4:52:59
component right here in figma when you copy and paste a component the pasted
4:53:05
element will be an instance of the original component instead of a direct copy this approach makes sense because
4:53:11
having multiple copies of the exact same component is redundant right if you want
4:53:17
to copy a component and then edit it to create a different version you can detach the instance of that component
4:53:23
and then convert it into a new component I hope this makes sense to you now let's
4:53:28
go to the components page and then let's do the same thing with the other um
4:53:35
components so I will copy the footer and then I will go to the main design page
4:53:40
and then I will scroll down and then click here and then paste it and now I
4:53:46
will move it up and then remove this
4:53:51
one now let's go back to the components page let's copy this one let's go back to the main design page and then while
4:53:59
we select uh the tablet version We paste it here and then we move it up we remove
4:54:06
this one and then that's it
4:54:11
now let's go to the footer here and then we select it we copy it and then we
4:54:18
paste it here in the tablet version and now we activate the
4:54:25
grid and then we resize it like
4:54:31
this let's resize this side as well and then let's move it up
4:54:43
let's toggle Off the Grid now looking at the desktop version in the tablet version there is one thing
4:54:49
that doesn't convince me too much and it's basically the space in between um these cards the proportion doesn't seem
4:54:59
right if you look at this one and then this one so let's change this spacing on the
4:55:05
uh tablet version so let's select the tablet version Let's uh toggle on the
4:55:10
grid and then let's go here in the properties panel and then let's change
4:55:16
the gor to 24 pixels now let's resize each of these
4:55:23
cards so they fit the grid perfectly and there are different ways
4:55:28
to do this and a very efficient way to do it is with variants and you will learn how to use variant later in the
4:55:35
course but for now we'll just resize them manually like one by one
4:55:40
so let's resize this one first and make sure that it aligns perfectly with the grid remember to maintain
4:55:48
shift now this one is perfectly
4:55:53
aligned to make sure that the sizing of all these uh instances is accurate we
4:56:00
have to go to the properties panel while we have this one selected that we already
4:56:05
resized and then we have to see these values and we have to apply this value to all these other instances so one by
4:56:14
one the values are 353 width and then the height is
4:56:22
462 to save time we will select all these instances by maintaining shift and
4:56:28
then we'll go to the property panel and we see that it says mixed we'll change
4:56:33
this the width to 353 and then the height to 462
4:56:40
and now it's going to change the sizing on all of them and don't worry about aligning them right now because we will
4:56:46
do so with auto layout in a few moments the next thing we will do before we forget is to save this um grid into a
4:56:54
style so let's select this Frame then go to the properties panel and then here these four dots we click and then we
4:57:02
click this plus sign and now we'll have the option to um you know here when we
4:57:07
click show options to select this grid and then create the Styles so the name is going to be
4:57:13
tablet grid and then we click create
4:57:19
style and now if we click here on the canvas we can see that we have the desktop grid and the tablet grid now
4:57:26
let's toggle Off the Grid and then let's start applying Auto
4:57:32
layout let's select all these frames and then apply Auto layout
4:57:41
let's toggle on the grid and then now let's rename this Frame and we will go
4:57:47
and look what name we gave to this Frame which is nested projects container we
4:57:53
will copy this and then we will name this Frame exactly
4:58:01
that next we will change the spacing so instead of 44 pixels as we can see here
4:58:09
we will change it to to 40
4:58:14
pixels now while we have the frame selected we will go to the properties panel again and then we will align it to
4:58:20
the center and then double click to set the gap between items to Auto and now we will resize the frame so
4:58:29
it aligns with the grid now as we can see everything is
4:58:35
perfectly aligned now here since we are going to
4:58:41
use the same spacing here and and then here we can just you
4:58:48
know cut by pressing control or command and x and then select this Frame and
4:58:55
then paste it here and now we have it here at the bottom so with the with the arrow on the keyboard we can move it
4:59:03
up now let's toggle off the grid for a second and then let's see which other
4:59:09
Auto layout frame we have to create so let's go to this um frame and then let's
4:59:17
see all right we have to create an all layout frame connecting
4:59:22
this frame with this Frame and then we have to give it an space in here all
4:59:30
right so let's select this Frame and then this Frame and then let's create an auto layout
4:59:36
frame now let's set the spacing here 248
4:59:43
pixels let's see how it looks
4:59:49
um maybe let's try
4:59:55
56 yeah it looks better now let's see which name we gave
5:00:00
to this Frame project section so let's copy
5:00:07
it and then let's select the this one and then paste it
5:00:16
here all right let's see which other frame we have to create
5:00:22
so I think it's this one yes this one that connects all this
5:00:29
content with the CTA so let's do that let's select this
5:00:37
and then this Frame and then let's activate a L
5:00:43
out now we'll set the spacing here to
5:00:49
100 um 28 pixels let's see how it
5:00:57
looks yeah it looks good there is something that doesn't
5:01:02
convince me here in the footer menus and it's probably because since
5:01:09
since the contact UM menu item is centered here inside of this uh frame
5:01:17
but it's not really centered when we look at the entire you know like page
5:01:22
right it doesn't like it's not centered because we have two menu items here so I
5:01:28
will just move this to the right side so we have three menu items here and then
5:01:34
the copyright um text here so let's do that before we advance
5:01:40
to the next stage of the design since this is a component we have to go to the
5:01:46
components page and then find the component which is this the footer menu and then we
5:01:53
select it and I will take this Frame and then I will cut it control or
5:02:01
command and x and then I will select this Frame right and then I will paste
5:02:07
it and now I will move it with the with the keyboard with the keyboard arrows to the left
5:02:15
side now when I go to the main design page I can see the
5:02:23
change it also changed here because we are using the same component and this is
5:02:28
the beauty of using components that we are very time efficient now let's see which is the
5:02:35
next aut layout frame you have to create so let me click here and as we can see
5:02:40
is this one right the uh connection or grouping if you will of this Frame and
5:02:46
this Frame and now that I have this Frame
5:02:52
connected I can see that I forgot to add the name and that's okay because we can
5:02:58
rename it right now um sometimes this will happen right you will be working on a file and then you you know you will
5:03:05
forget to name some stuff but that's fine as long as you name everything before you know doing a developer
5:03:13
handoff or before sharing the file with other designers and stakeholders you have to make sure that all the frames
5:03:20
are named with the advancements of AI technology we'll probably be able to create very solid and strong naming
5:03:27
conventions automatically but at the moment you have to get used to naming everything manually I'm aware that there
5:03:34
are some plugins that help you name the uh layers automatically but I wanted to
5:03:40
show you and let you know that you have to um you know develop the habit of
5:03:46
naming everything because the naming conventions will change depending on uh
5:03:51
the project you are working on all right so let's rename this Frame
5:03:57
and we can call it content
5:04:05
container now let's create this aut layout frame here in the the tablet breakpoint so we select this and then
5:04:13
this right these two and then we press and maintain shift a and we create the
5:04:20
auto layout frame now let's set the space in here to
5:04:28
96 pixels it looks
5:04:35
good now let's create the next AO layout frame which is going to be
5:04:40
let me see all right so this Frame and this
5:04:46
Frame so we select this and then this and then we create an a layout frame and
5:04:53
now we set the spacing here to 96 pixels as
5:04:58
well and we set the same space in here and uh
5:05:06
here because here in the desktop version as we can see we have the same spacing
5:05:14
here and here so when designing the different
5:05:19
break points we always take into consideration and as a reference the uh
5:05:24
spacing you know and layout of the desktop version now as we saw before in
5:05:30
this course when we talked about the uh adaptive design and responsive design we
5:05:35
know that the layout even though this is going to be the reference right the layout is going to change especially on
5:05:41
mobile it's going to be different because it doesn't make sense to replicate the exact same layout on all
5:05:47
the different break points right so we will see that when we um when we when we design the mobile version the layout is
5:05:54
going to be different and that design method it's called one two and three yeah adaptive
5:06:03
design now let's rename the layers that we just created so we go here and we see
5:06:10
this one is already named if I'm not mistaken no it's not named so this is
5:06:15
called content container so we copy the name and then we select it here in the
5:06:21
uh you know tablet breakpoint and then we paste it
5:06:27
here and then we do the same thing with the others so this
5:06:33
one it's called project section
5:06:42
we paste it here and then the last one it's called
5:06:50
container so let's just change the name to
5:06:55
container and that's it now let's group this Frame and then
5:07:01
this frame with an auto layout frame so let's select both and then shift
5:07:07
a and this Frame is going to to be called container as
5:07:19
well and now let's set the spacing here which is going to
5:07:25
be 160 pixels and then finally let's convert
5:07:31
this main frame into an auto layout
5:07:38
frame and now let's set the padding on the entire
5:07:44
frame to 40 pixels we can already delete the uh
5:07:51
wireframe and then let's select these two frames I mean these two main frames
5:07:58
and then let's go to the auto layout uh panel here and then let's align
5:08:03
everything to Center I aligned everything to the
5:08:08
center because let's say that we want to see how this page would look on a wider
5:08:15
screen so we can create a copy like I did right now and then we stretch the
5:08:20
frame and as we can see everything is centered and then now here we could uh
5:08:27
you know tweak the layout if we want like more columns here or we want the
5:08:32
content to cover more space we could do it all right so let's delete this and
5:08:39
then now it's time to create the tablet uh expanded menu to do so we will make a copy of
5:08:46
this Frame and then we will delete everything minus the menu so you can just start
5:08:56
deleting all the layers in the footer and then we'll
5:09:01
deactivate Auto layout now right here then we'll stretch this
5:09:14
now we will change the background color to um to this blue so while we have the
5:09:21
frame selected we go to the properties panel and then we go to libraries and
5:09:27
then we select this color the light
5:09:34
blue this way we integrate more of this shade of blue into the
5:09:41
design now let's change the background color of this Frame because if not we cannot see it
5:09:48
since the background uh of the main frame is the same color so let's go to the properties panel and then let's
5:09:55
change it to White for now and see how it looks looks good now we can remove the uh the logo
5:10:04
because we don't need it here
5:10:09
now let's add the menu items here so we have work Services B us and
5:10:16
contact so work then we make a copy
5:10:26
Services another copy then
5:10:31
um about us another
5:10:36
copy and then cont
5:10:45
and we have to add the blog as well so let's add it now let's make another copy
5:10:50
here and this is going to be the blog and then I will reorder it um in a
5:10:57
minute so here we don't have the BL so we have
5:11:02
to go to the main component and we can do so by going to the components page or
5:11:08
you know we can just select the the instance here and then right
5:11:15
click and go to main component and now this is going to take us to the
5:11:20
component directly and this is a good way to save a little bit of time now that we are in the main
5:11:27
component we are going to make a copy of the services and then we will write BL and
5:11:35
now we have the BL menu item in the header
5:11:41
component now let's go back to the main design
5:11:46
page and then let's go to the expanded uh tablet
5:11:54
menu let's rename this uh main frame to
5:12:00
expanded tablet
5:12:06
menu now let's change the phone size of the menu items because I want them to be large so let's select all of them then
5:12:14
go to the properties panel and then let's add 72 and see how it
5:12:19
looks um looks looks good so now we have to select them and then activate Auto
5:12:28
layout now we have Auto layout activated but it's set to wrap that's why this
5:12:34
looks a little bit messy so let's go to the aut layout panel and then let's select
5:12:40
vertical
5:12:45
layout now let's move these here and then let's select all the
5:12:53
um all the menu items and then let's set the line height to
5:13:06
120% now let's select the aut layout frame frame and then let's change the
5:13:11
spacing between menu items to 34
5:13:17
pixels remember always respecting the um eight point grid system right So a
5:13:23
multiple of eight now let's frame each of these uh menu items uh with auto layout so we
5:13:31
select this one and then activate Auto layout and then here Auto layout as well
5:13:36
and then this one Auto layout Auto layout and aut layout now let's rename the
5:13:43
frames so this we can call it um menu
5:13:54
items container now we select all the menu items and then we right
5:14:02
click and now we navigate to
5:14:07
rename and now we see this pop up and then here we will name it menu item and
5:14:16
then we'll add this dollar sign and then two ends so we have them perfectly
5:14:22
numbered now we press I mean we click rename and that's
5:14:30
it now let's change this because here it should say
5:14:37
close this way we can close the expanded menu by clicking this button I just
5:14:43
noticed that uh the logo we had here is not removed I mean the frame that
5:14:48
contain the logo is not removed and that's because when I uh when I remove the logo I selected the text instead of
5:14:55
the frame so let's select the Heather and then here in the um layers panel we
5:15:01
can see how the the text is hidden but the uh frame is not so we can just
5:15:09
select the this Frame where it says logo and then delete it and as you can see it's not completely deleted that's
5:15:17
because this is a is an instance right so we are not really deleting this uh
5:15:22
this logo because if we deleted this right if this was completely deleted it would be deleted in the main instance
5:15:29
and that's not what we want now let's navigate back to the menu so here we can
5:15:34
see that the uh you know this menu item if you will this uh close button is now
5:15:42
moved to the left and that's because we just removed the logo from this instance
5:15:47
so let's align it to the right let's go to the uh layers panel and then we select this and then we go to the auto
5:15:55
layout panel we deactivate the automatic gap between items by double clicking
5:16:00
here and now we can see that the um the close button is set to the center right
5:16:08
so we we go back to the aut layout panel and then we align it to the right now
5:16:15
let's go back to the layers panel and then here we can see how these
5:16:23
um you know these menu items are not placed inside
5:16:28
of this uh order layout frame and it should be here right so let's select this Frame and
5:16:36
then we drag it inside of this container and now we'll see how it's
5:16:42
placed Right Here and Now by pressing the down arrow
5:16:48
key on our keyboard we move it down now let's select this
5:16:56
Frame then go to the auto layout panel and then align it to the top
5:17:02
left and now we have the menu correctly placed now let's reset this
5:17:10
spacing to 80
5:17:17
pixels now let's select this Frame and then activate a layout now in this case we will go to
5:17:24
the properties panel and then we will set the um you know the height to
5:17:30
fixed and then we will go here and then we will stretch the frame to cover the
5:17:36
entire vertical viewport now let's reorder the menu items so they
5:17:42
follow the same order as
5:17:51
here done and that's it we just created the expanded tablet
5:17:59
menu now the next step is to create the mobile brako so let's create a
5:18:07
frame something like this then we'll resize it now while we have it selected we go to
5:18:13
the properties panel and then the width should be 375 pixels now we will rename this uh main
5:18:21
frame to Mobile
5:18:30
homepage now let's go to the wireframes and components page then let's look for the mobile
5:18:37
version this one and then let's copy and paste this to the to this
5:18:48
page right here and now this is going to be like an
5:18:54
exercise for you so you will um you know complete the mobile version you have the
5:18:59
wireframe here and then you have everything you need here so just complete it and then um we'll be done
5:19:07
with this first page page go to free webdesign course.com sourse files and
5:19:12
you will find there all the figma files and everything you need to complete this exercise if you need help with any of
5:19:20
the exercises or task in this course feel free to join our private community at webdesigners collective.com I'm very
5:19:27
active there and you will find also other designers willing to help it's totally free to join all right so here
5:19:34
is the completed design of the homepage and as I was um completing this um like
5:19:40
the mobile version I just noticed that here in this icon I didn't activate Auto
5:19:46
layout so let's activate it right now it was like a little bit off and
5:19:52
then not notice so you know just select it and then activate all
5:19:58
layout and do the same thing here in the mobile version and also in the desktop
5:20:04
version this happened because when I imported these um icon into the desktop
5:20:10
version I didn't activate Auto layout because at that moment I didn't need Auto layout right and this happens all
5:20:15
the time so the best thing to do is to always double or triple check everything all right so here is the
5:20:22
entire design and then I want you to complete the final exercise and the
5:20:27
final exercise is basically designing all these pages right all these pages I
5:20:34
want you to replicate and you will have access to this figma file you know go to the um
5:20:41
you know free webdesign course.com sour files and you will find this figma file
5:20:47
so you can take this as reference this design is simple
5:20:52
functional and looks good if I had an architecture studio right now I'd like my website to look like this you can see
5:20:59
my style reflected in this design however as designers it's important not to get to attach to a particular
5:21:06
style Bruce Lee one said something like this in an interview I do not believe in
5:21:11
Styles you should Express Yourself totally and completely that way you won't create a style because styl is
5:21:19
crystallization even though I have a preferred style for my own projects I can adapt to any style proposed to me
5:21:25
because I have learned the art of adaptation and growth this is crucial for you as a web designer as well
5:21:32
because you know you have to embrace flexibility and continuous Improvement in your work and always be open to new
5:21:39
ideas and styles all right cool so as you can see here we are using some
5:21:44
different shades of blue and all this is intentional all right I use this light blue here because when there there is um
5:21:51
a lot of text in a page I prefer to use a very light color instead of pure white it makes the text easier to read in this
5:22:00
Sigma file you will have all the color styles grid Styles and font Styles use
5:22:05
them to complete the design and as always always if you have any questions just let me know and make sure that you
5:22:12
join us you know in the um in the group in the private group because there you
5:22:17
will find other fellow designers you will be able to ask questions you know participate and don't be the typical
5:22:24
person that is U you know member of a community and never participate never
5:22:29
ask questions it's very important for you to do that if you want to grow so I
5:22:35
will see you there now I will expl explain what a style guide is and why it's important to
5:22:41
have one you will learn how a style guide helps ensure consistency efficiency and a strong brand identity
5:22:47
in web design by the end of this lesson you will understand the key elements of a style guide and the benefits it brings
5:22:54
to your projects so what is a style guide a style guide is a detailed document that explains the design
5:23:00
standards and guidelines for a website or application it serves as a reference
5:23:05
tool for designers developers and content creators making sure that everything looks and works consistently
5:23:12
a style guide usually includes information about the brand identity such as how to use the logo the color
5:23:18
palette the typography and icons it also outlines design principles like layout
5:23:23
grids spacing and Alignment rules additionally it includes guidelines for user interface components
5:23:30
such as buttons forms and navigation bars as well as content guidelines for tone of voice grammar and formatting
5:23:36
standards lastly it pro provides instructions on how to use media like images and
5:23:42
videos so why it's important to have a style guide having a style guide is crucial for several reasons first it
5:23:48
ensures consistency across all elements of the website or application making everything look and feel more cohesive
5:23:55
this consistency builds trust with users and enhances their experience second a style guide helps teams work more
5:24:01
efficiently with clear guidelines designers and developers don't have to make decisions on the Fly reducing the
5:24:08
time spent on revisions and speeding up the project completion third a style guide helps maintain a strong and
5:24:14
recognizable brand identity by following the predefined standards every piece of content reinforces the Brand's image and
5:24:20
message fourth it promotes better collaboration among team members it acts
5:24:25
as a common reference point making it easier for new team members to understand and follow the established
5:24:31
design practices fifth a style guide helps maintain high quality output by adhering
5:24:38
to the guidelines the final product is more likely to be polished and professional six it ensures scalability
5:24:45
as the website or application grows a style guide helps new features and Pages align with the existing design which is
5:24:51
crucial for long-term maintenance and expansion and finally a consistent design makes it easier for users to
5:24:57
navigate and interact with the website a familiar look and feel enhances usability and overall
5:25:03
satisfaction you can find the style guide for this website here in this
5:25:12
page feel free to replicate it you can also add some stuff that is missing like
5:25:17
the um textiles for example these textiles right you can add them here you
5:25:23
can also add some other stuff that you think it's missing you can do some research because the style guide can be
5:25:30
way more comprehensive than this but I just wanted to show you how it looks in
5:25:35
conclusion a style guide is an essential tool for any we design project it promotes consistency efficiency and
5:25:42
strong brand identity while enhancing user experience by investing time in creating a detailed style guide teams
5:25:48
can ensure their projects are cohesive scalable and also high quality in this
5:25:54
lesson you learn how to design a website using figma and also what a style guide is and when to create
5:26:00
one here are a couple of things to keep in mind every designer has a unique way
5:26:05
of Designing I show you how I do it but it doesn't mean that you have to do it exactly like me feel free to experiment
5:26:12
and build your own process but always keep in mind the main design fundamentals study and understand the
5:26:19
rules before trying to break them your designs and processes will
5:26:24
most likely never be 100% perfect but you should always strive for excellence mistakes are normal and part of building
5:26:31
something exciting just make sure to be diligent when working on projects for real clients by double or even triple
5:26:37
checking everything everything it's very easy to overlook things when there are so many moving pieces congratulations on
5:26:45
finishing module 3 now you know how to design websites and that's awesome this is an incredible Milestone and I'm very
5:26:51
proud of you make sure to share what you've learn in the community and try to help others as you become an expert it's
5:26:58
our responsibility as designers to teach and help others so thanks for taking action and I will see you in module 4
5:27:05
all right welcome to module 4 if you are new here this is the fourth module of the free web design course that is very
5:27:12
comprehensive and detail that I'm sharing here for free on YouTube in this module I will talk about the different
5:27:17
web design career paths in detail and I will also help you choose the right one for you and before we begin I want to
5:27:24
let you know that we have a web design community that is very high quality and it's totally free to join so check it
5:27:30
out by clicking the link in the description all right let's go in this lesson we'll talk about the different
5:27:36
specific career paths in web design as you already know a career is a web designer involves creating the visual
5:27:42
elements of a website such as the layout color schemes typography and so on a
5:27:48
good web designer must have a very good eye for design and also be skilled in using design software like pigma for
5:27:56
example as we also discussed in previous modules good web designers also need a
5:28:01
basic understanding of HTML and CSS to communicate effectively with developers so in terms of freelancing it's easier
5:28:08
to get freelance jobs with businesses directly as a web designer than it would be as a uxui designer or as a product
5:28:16
designer for example but more on this a little later if you are more interested
5:28:22
in being more specialized in how user interact with websites and you are you know leaning more towards trying to work
5:28:28
in a company a career as a uxui designer might be the right choice for
5:28:33
you as I refresh ux designers focus more on uring that websites are user friendly
5:28:40
and meet the needs of the people using them you are designers on the other hand concentrate on the look and layout of
5:28:47
the website in interactive elements if you want to specialize in both and you want to become a uxu
5:28:53
designer you will need to develop uh skills in interface design user research
5:28:59
um you know wireframing and prototyping uxu designers are essential for creating
5:29:04
websites that are both functional and Visually appealing and remember the key difference between
5:29:11
a web designer and a uxu designer is that a web designer typically has a
5:29:16
wider range of skills web designers are usually generalist uh able to handle
5:29:21
multiple aspects of web creation from design to basic coding however it's important to understand that not all web
5:29:29
designers are the same some may also specialize in particular areas making
5:29:34
them generalist specialist and no worries if this sounds a little bit too confusing because I will explain it to
5:29:40
you right now because being a generalist specialist is extremely powerful there
5:29:45
is a concept called t-shape that explains this very well it describes how
5:29:50
someone can be a generalist with a wide knowledge base or a specialist with deep
5:29:56
expertise in a specific area some individuals fall in between as generally
5:30:02
specialist combining broad skills with deep expertise in one particular field many people have ventured into uxui
5:30:09
design and chosen to specialize because they believe that being a specialist
5:30:14
leads to higher salaries or earnings while it's understandable to think this
5:30:20
way in my opinion it can be more beneficial to become a web designer who is exceptionally strong in uxui design
5:30:27
but also proficient in other areas this approach can open up many more opportunities for you as having a
5:30:35
broader skill set allows you to tackle a wider range of projects and adapt to
5:30:40
different roles as needed and here's a pro tip to avoid being perceived as a
5:30:45
quote unquote Jag of all trades master of known while still benefiting from a
5:30:51
broad skill set you can strategically present yourself as a specialist and
5:30:56
then once you get the job you can little by little start showcasing your versatility demonstrating your wider
5:31:03
range of skills and uh here's how you can approach this number one position
5:31:09
yourself as a specialist in your resume portfolio and during interviews emphasize your deep expertise in a
5:31:15
specific area for example if you are strong in um you know uxui design
5:31:21
position yourself as a uxui specialist this approach will help you meet the expectations of employers or clients who
5:31:28
are looking for a specialist in the field number two demonstrate versatility subtly while focusing on your
5:31:35
specialization you can also drop hints about your wider skill set without weakening your specialist
5:31:41
brand for example you could mention how your uxui expertise is complemented by
5:31:48
your knowledge of front end development or graphic design phrases like deep
5:31:53
expertise in uxui with strong complimentary skills in web design and coding can subtly communicate your
5:32:00
versatility or maybe something like uxu are designer with strong branding
5:32:06
expertise number three show don't sell after you are hire obviously once you
5:32:12
secure the job this is where you can truly demonstrate your value Begin by excelling in the area you were hired for
5:32:19
as you build trust improve your expertise you can gradually showcase your other skills for example if a
5:32:25
project requires Design Elements outside of uxui offer help you know by
5:32:31
constantly delivering high quality work across various tasks you will position yourself as inv valuable asset who can
5:32:38
handle multiple responsibilities number four become a problem solver use your
5:32:43
wider skill set to solve problems that others might not be equipped to handle if you see a gap in the project whether
5:32:50
it's related to design content or coding or whatever propose solutions that draw
5:32:56
on your other skills this proactive approach will make you stand out as someone who brings more to the table
5:33:03
than just your specialist knowledge number five build relationships whether
5:33:09
you are an employee or a freelancer building strong relationships with colleagues clients and stakeholders is
5:33:15
key as you gain their trust in your specialized role they will be more open to you taking on additional
5:33:22
responsibilities once people see that you can contribute beyond your primary role they will likely view you as a
5:33:29
super valuable resource rather than just an other specialist this will make you a
5:33:34
very special player don't try to impress them by showcasing all your skills in
5:33:40
different areas at once you might overwhelm them with all this you know unnecessary information instead wait for
5:33:47
the right moment when there is a gap in the project that's when you can shine be
5:33:52
patient and think strategically to Define who can be considered the shape or a specialist is
5:33:59
relative right it depends on the context for example a ux designer is often seen
5:34:04
as a specialist but can also be considered a t-shaped um you know
5:34:09
generalist specialist because they may be proficient in other areas related to ux design like ux research and
5:34:17
prototyping or even areas not um you know in areas not directly related to ux
5:34:22
such as 3D rendering when we take a closer look we often find that most people have skills
5:34:29
beyond their main specialization the t-shape model though helps us better understand and communicate the range of
5:34:35
capabilities each person has a web designer often fits into the t-shape model as a generalist or a
5:34:42
generalist specialist this means that they have a broad range of skills across
5:34:47
many areas of web design you know the horizontal line of the tea but they can
5:34:52
also be highly skill in one specific area the vertical line of the te for example a web designer might understand
5:34:59
coding branding and storytelling but they might be particularly strong in uxui design this combination of broad
5:35:07
and deep skills makes them versatile and valuable in various types of projects
5:35:13
however it's important to recognize that skills and experiences outside of web design can be just as powerful for
5:35:19
example a dentist who transitions into web design and starts freelancing may have a unique Advantage when working
5:35:26
with dental clinics their deep understanding of how dental clinics operate the industry specific needs and
5:35:33
patient expectations can make them far more effective than a designer who lacks this background this unique combination
5:35:40
of Niche expertise and design skills can become an unfair Advantage setting them apart from other designers in the
5:35:47
field in fact any skills or experiences you have outside of web design can
5:35:52
become assets that enhance your work by leveraging your brother experiences you
5:35:57
can deepen the vertical line of your t-shape positioning yourself as not just
5:36:03
a web designer but also a specialist in creating Solutions taor to specific
5:36:08
Industries or challenges so imagine I own a dental clinic and I want to hire a
5:36:14
designer and I have two offers right the first one is from a skilled web designer with no Dental background and the second
5:36:20
one is from an equally skilled designer who also happens to be a dentist who would I choose right most likely I'll
5:36:28
choose the dentist or designer because that person will know exactly what I need this specialized Insight would lead
5:36:34
to a smoother process and also a website that resonate more effectively with both
5:36:40
the Clinic's needs and also its patients this idea can apply to any Niche right
5:36:45
whether you are coming from a background in Fitness law education sports or any other field your um unique experiences
5:36:53
can set you apart from other designers so think about your own unfair advantages and here is a little exercise
5:37:00
make a list of the unique values you bring to the table that most people can't and then think about about how you
5:37:08
can leverage your background skills and experiences to provide the specialized value and this is very important because
5:37:14
by identifying and promoting these strengths you can position yourself as a standout designer in your toes and Niche
5:37:20
so we talked a lot about web designers what about uxui designers a uxui designer can be
5:37:27
considered a specialist within the t-shape model but here's a very important thing to consider so pay
5:37:33
attention this classification depends on the criteria we are using if we narrow
5:37:38
down our Focus we might see that a uxu designer could also be considered a
5:37:44
generalist in this case a ux designer or and I am emphasizing the word or U are
5:37:51
designer could be viewed as a specialist with further specialization Within These disciplines such as user research
5:37:59
interaction design usability testing and others so I hope all this makes sense so
5:38:05
it basically indicates that uxu design is a specialization within a
5:38:11
specialization depending on the criteria if we talk about web design uxu
5:38:18
design could be considered a specialization within the web design discipline but at the same time ux
5:38:24
design could be a specialization within the ux UI design discipline then ux research could be a
5:38:31
specialization within the ux discipline we can narrow it down as much as we want right the t-shape model just helps us
5:38:38
understand our capabilities and how can we um you know better present our expertise to
5:38:44
others all right so let me show you an example this first diagram shows the
5:38:49
specialization path for web designers it starts with design at a more General
5:38:56
level then Narrows down to digital design then web design uxui design ux
5:39:01
design and then finally ux research this path demonstrates how some
5:39:07
one can move from General design knowledge to a very specify Focus within the field of web
5:39:13
design however web design is not the only path all right as you can see in
5:39:18
the second diagram product design represents another specialization route just like web design product design
5:39:25
starts with a broad foundation in design and digital design but then branches off into product design uxu design plays a
5:39:33
crucial role in both paths in web design it focuses on the user experience and interface design of websites while in
5:39:41
product design it centers on the design of digital applications and software including web apps mobile apps
5:39:47
Etc this shows that uxu design is important in both areas though applied
5:39:52
differently depending on the focus and context this demonstrates that within the field of design there are multiple
5:39:59
Pathways you can follow each leading to different areas of expertise whether you
5:40:05
choose web design product design or another path each step allows you to focus more deeply on a specific area
5:40:12
while still building on the BR design skills you've learn all right so in this
5:40:17
lesson you've learned what the T shap model is how to avoid being perceived as a Jag of all traits master of known and
5:40:25
also how to leverage your past experiences as an unfair Advantage now
5:40:30
let's move to the next lesson all right so now that you understand the differences between being a generalist a
5:40:36
generalist specialist and a specialist as well as what the um t-shape model is
5:40:41
let's dive into which career path might be better suited for you if you are someone who values Independence enjoys
5:40:47
managing your own projects and likes the idea of working with a variety of clients then a career as a web designer
5:40:54
might be the perfect fit for you as a web designer freelancing offers you the flexibility to work directly with
5:41:00
businesses or collaborate with agencies on a project by project basis this path
5:41:05
allows you to take on Multi clients from small businesses in need of a new website to large agencies looking for
5:41:12
design support on more extensive projects freelancing as a web designer
5:41:17
is ideal for those who prefer Variety in their work enjoy the talent of managing
5:41:22
their own business and also want the freedom to choose the projects they work on and this is very important because as
5:41:29
an employee of a company you are required to uh work on any project that comes down the pipeline without the
5:41:35
freedom of choice if if a project doesn't align with your values or is something you rather not work on you
5:41:41
often have to complete it anyways refusing to do so could get you fired in addition to technical skills you'll also
5:41:48
need strong communication skills which are essential for working with clients and translating their needs into
5:41:54
effective web designs freelancing as a web designer also requires some business knowhow as you'll be responsible for
5:42:01
managing client relationships pricing your services and ensuring a steady workflow it's not easy but the rewards
5:42:10
can be incredibly fulfilling so basically you would have freedom and it's awesome as a freelancer you have
5:42:17
the potential to earn as much as you want provided you have the right skills and a solid structure to scale your
5:42:23
business in contrast as an employee you might have a good salary but it's
5:42:28
usually capped at a certain level Additionally the sense of security that comes with being an employee can be
5:42:36
misleading and you can still be fired sometimes without prior notice so it's
5:42:41
not always as secure as it seems that being said being an employee also offers
5:42:46
the opportunity to climb the corporate ladder become a uh key player in a large
5:42:51
company and contribute to its long-term vision and success which can be also very rewarding you can also start as an
5:43:00
employee gain experience build connections and later in your career transition to freelancing or even start
5:43:06
your own agency there are many valid paths it's all about choosing the one
5:43:12
that works best for you I've created a quick and easy Clarity survey designed to help you choose your ideal career
5:43:19
path by answering a few simple questions the survey will analyze your preferences
5:43:26
and provide you with a clear Direction it's a fast and straightforward way to
5:43:31
avoid spending years trying to figure things out on your own this survey is
5:43:36
perfect for anyone serious about finding the right career fit without wasting time best of all it's completely free so
5:43:44
make sure to complete it now beginning a career in web design can be intimidating and confusing but I'm
5:43:51
here to help you navigate all the complexity so don't take this free information for
5:43:56
granted as human beings it's very easy for us to dismiss free resources sometimes because we perceive them as
5:44:04
low quality but that's not how the world works right this free information could
5:44:10
be exactly what you need to start changing your life for the better today
5:44:16
as I mentioned in the introduction of this course back in module one I could be selling this course for thousands of
5:44:22
US Dollars like most people do and there is nothing wrong with that but I chose to share all this information for free
5:44:29
because I want to make a real impact and reach more people maybe I should say
5:44:34
bigger instead of real impact right since you can make a real impact by selling information as well but I feel
5:44:41
like by giving all this information for free I could help more beginners get
5:44:47
started so take action and you will see where your effort and dedication can take you all right so if you took the
5:44:55
survey and it shows that you are more fitted to work as an employee you should consider specializing in UI design if
5:45:03
you prefer a more quote unquote stable work environment and enjoy collaborating with a team and want to be deeply
5:45:09
involved in the design and development process of websites and applications a career as a uxui designer might be more
5:45:16
suitable for you while it's certainly possible to work as an independent freelance uxui designer this role is
5:45:23
often more suited to working within an agency or as a part of an in-house team
5:45:29
at a company this is because ux design as we just saw is more specialized
5:45:35
focusing specifically on how users interact with a website or an app agencies and larger companies typically
5:45:42
require this level of precise expertise on different parts of the team because they want to ensure that their digital
5:45:49
products are super user friendly and highly effective and obviously they have the capital to hire more Talent than
5:45:56
small businesses or bootstrap startups businesses that hire someone to design their entire website often look for a
5:46:03
web designer who can cover a wider scope of work however uxu designers are
5:46:08
essential for projects that require detail user research testing and refinement of the user interface which
5:46:16
are critical components of creating high quality digital experiences therefore uxu design roles often involve more
5:46:23
collaboration with cross functional teams and are typically part of long-term uh projects making them a
5:46:30
better fit for agency work or inhouse positions and with all this I'm not
5:46:35
saying that it's impossible possible to get freelance jobs as a uxu designer I'm saying that it's easier to work with
5:46:42
small companies or small agencies directly as a web designer and as we explored previously being a t-shaped web
5:46:50
designer with a strong uxui um you know design skills makes you more versatile
5:46:55
allowing you to landar jobs as a solo freelancer or work with a larger agency or company it's also important to note
5:47:03
that within the uxu design field as we also previously discussed you can choose
5:47:09
to specialize further as either a ux designer or a UI designer specializing
5:47:15
in either ux or U design can allow you to Horn your skills in a specific area
5:47:21
of Interest making you more valuable in certain specific roles particularly in
5:47:27
larger companies or agencies where um these functions are often separated okay
5:47:33
so in this lesson youve learn how to identify your ideal role in career path as a designer all right so in this lesson
5:47:40
we'll talk about the next steps to take after learing the job once you've chosen your career path in web design and
5:47:46
secure a job whether as a freelancer or an in-house designer it's important to
5:47:51
think about your long-term career goals and the opportunities for growth that lie
5:47:57
ahead we will start with in-house roles and I want you to understand that um
5:48:02
your journey doesn't stop at getting the job all right that's just the beginning so let's explore the next steps and
5:48:09
potential career advancements you can aim for you know depending on the career path you've
5:48:14
chosen while I've primarily worked as a freelancer this experience has given me a unique point of view I've collaborated
5:48:22
closely with companies and observe how in-house teams function from the inside
5:48:27
this has allowed me to understand the corporate environment and the opportunities available for designers I
5:48:33
might not have been an employee in the sense I mean in the traditional sense but my freelance work has provided me
5:48:40
with deep insights that I'm happy to share all right so with that in mind
5:48:46
let's explore the different roles and growth opportunities available to you as an in-house
5:48:52
designer when you first start you begin as a junior designer where you will gain more experience and refine your skills
5:48:58
under the guidance of more experienced designers typically though after one to three years in a junior role you will
5:49:05
have built enough expertise to progress to a Midway designer with 3 to 5 years of experience
5:49:12
you may advance to a senior designer role senior designers often take on more complex projects Mentor junior team
5:49:18
members and also have a greater influence on design decisions this progression can vary
5:49:25
right depending on the company and your growth as well after proving your capabilities as a senior designer you
5:49:32
may be promoted to a lead designer or design lead position in this role you will oversee a team of designers
5:49:38
ensuring that the design work aligns with the uh company's goals and brand you may also collaborate closely with
5:49:44
other departments such as marketing product development and Engineering to ensure cohesive and effective design
5:49:51
Solutions the transision between a senior designer and lead designer typically occurs after 7 to 10 years of
5:49:58
experience in the field the next step is to become an art director and as an art
5:50:03
director you take on a wider creative leadership role disos involves overseeing dividual style and artistic
5:50:09
aspects of projects across the company you will be responsible for setting dividual tone managing design teams and
5:50:16
ensuring that the Creative Vision is consistently executed across all media
5:50:21
and our directors often work closely with both designers and other creative professionals such as copywriters and
5:50:28
photographers to bring a cohesive Creative Vision to life this role requires a deep understanding of design
5:50:35
strong leaders ERS ship and the ability to inspire and direct a creative team typically reaching this position
5:50:42
requires 8 to 12 years of experience in the field for those who aspire to the
5:50:48
highest level of creative leadership becoming a creative director is often the ultimate goal as a creative director
5:50:54
you'll be responsible for the overall Creative Vision and direction of the design work across the entire company
5:51:01
this role involves leading the uh design team and other creative teams shaping the brands identity setting design
5:51:08
standards and also working with top Executives to drive the uh company's creative strategy it's a role that
5:51:15
requires not only design expertise but also strong leadership and strategic thinking skills typically reaching this
5:51:22
position requires around 10 to 15 years of experience another potential path for
5:51:28
in-house designers is to specialize in a particular area such as um ux research
5:51:33
or UI design or accessibility for example and with this expertise you can become a specialist or a consultant
5:51:40
within your organization providing high level guidance on projects that require deep knowledge in your area of August
5:51:48
this can lead to opportunities to influence the direction of the company's products and services on a strategic
5:51:55
level in some very very special cases a person can make a significant leap in
5:52:01
their career for example a junior designer who is exceptionally talented and this discipline might jump from a
5:52:08
junior position to a Crea director within a year or two and although this is extremely rare in established
5:52:15
companies especially and uh in agencies as well it can happen it's extremely
5:52:20
unlikely but not impossible now let's talk about Freelancers as a freelancer
5:52:25
your career progression is more flexible and also entrepreneurial initially your
5:52:31
focus might be on expanding your client base and building a strong personal brand over time you can take on more
5:52:38
complex projects and also larger clients positioning yourself as a known expert in your field and as you gain experience
5:52:46
you can elevate your role from Simply delivering design work to taking on leadership responsibilities for example
5:52:52
you could work as a freelance design lead where you manage a team of designers or collaborate with agencies
5:52:58
on bigger projects similarly you could become a freelance art director or a
5:53:03
freelance creative director overseeing the Creative Vision and execution for your clients on project um you know on a
5:53:10
project by project basis these roles allow you to work at a higher level providing strategic guidance while still
5:53:17
enjoying the flexibility of freelancing in addition to advancing Your Role you can also explore options like creating
5:53:23
your own agency where you hire a team and take on larger projects alternatively you might choose to
5:53:30
diversify your services by offering specialized products such as uh design templates you know markup or
5:53:37
transitioning into Consulting and mentoring helping other designers grow while building a new Revenue stream in
5:53:43
this lesson you've learn what the growth opportunities are for in-house designers and for freelance designers as well in
5:53:49
this lesson we'll discuss the financial aspects of a career in web design and how remote work plays a role in this
5:53:55
field salaries in web design can vary significantly depending on factors such
5:54:01
as um experience location uh specialization and whether you choose to
5:54:06
work inh house remotely or as a freelancer for in-house designers
5:54:12
salaries are typically more stable and predictable entrylevel positions such as
5:54:17
Junior designers usually start with modest salaries but as you gain experience and move up to senior roles
5:54:24
your earning potential increases in recent years many companies have embraced remote work allowing designers
5:54:30
to work from anywhere while still receiving a stable salary remote work can also open opportunities to work for
5:54:37
companies in different regions or countries potentially increasing your earning potential all right so for example let's
5:54:45
start with Junior web designers depending on location and Company a junior web designer might earn between
5:54:51
40 to um 60,000 per year and this is in USD whether working in office or
5:54:57
remotely and I know that in some countries it might be even lower than this but uh that's why for some people
5:55:05
it's um more interesting to become a freelancer and that's the beauty of working remotely as well like you can be
5:55:12
based in Spain and then work you know um for a company that's in the United
5:55:18
States and uh the salaries are typically way higher in the United States than in Spain so that's that's a good thing to
5:55:25
keep in mind it's also worth noting that many US companies prefer to hire local
5:55:30
talent due to simpler legal and tax considerations however as a freelance
5:55:36
you can offer companies flexibility allowing them to scale their Workforce without the long-term commitment and
5:55:42
administrative overhead of hiring full-time employees we'll discuss
5:55:48
freelance earning Potentials in more detail a little later all right so let's talk about senior web designers with
5:55:54
more experience senior designers can expect salaries ranging from 60,000 to 990,000 USD or more per year with remote
5:56:02
positions often offering similar um compensation to in office roles in
5:56:07
leadership roles such as design lead or art director salaries can range from 80k
5:56:13
to 120k per year or higher with remote roles becoming increasingly common at
5:56:19
this level at the top of the hierarchy creative directors can earn anywhere
5:56:24
from 100,000 to 250k or more annually and many companies now offer remote
5:56:30
creative director roles especially in Creative agencies or tech companies that prioritize our digital
5:56:36
collaboration another thing to keep in mind is that in-house positions often come with additional benefits such as
5:56:43
health insurance uh retirement plans pay time off and sometimes stock options
5:56:48
stock options give employees the opportunity to purchase company shares at the set price which can add
5:56:55
substantial value to the compensation especially if the company grows and
5:57:00
these benefits are usually extended to full-time remote employees as well though the specific may vary depending
5:57:07
on the company's policies and the employees location all right so now let's talk about freelance designer
5:57:13
earnings and also remote work as a freelancer so as a freelancer your
5:57:19
income can vary um but you also have the potential to earn a lot more than
5:57:25
in-house designers if you manage your business effectively Freelancers typically work remotely by default but
5:57:32
in some specific cases they have to work in person as well but the most common
5:57:37
theme is that they enjoy the freedom to choose their um workspace and manage their schedules Freelancers charge
5:57:44
clients on a per project basis or by hourly rates and sometimes also through retainers typically monthly retainers
5:57:52
here is a general idea of what freelance web designers can earn when starting out
5:57:57
you might charge $25 to $50 per hour or a set fixed project rates based on the
5:58:04
scope of work working remote allows you to take on clients from different regions broadening your potential Market
5:58:11
with more experience in a solid portfolio Freelancers can charge $50 to $100 per hour or higher project fees
5:58:17
ranging from 5K to 15K per website and sometimes even more depending on the
5:58:23
complexity and the client if you specialize in a lucrative Niche or work as a freelance art director or creative
5:58:29
director your rates can be significantly higher sometimes reaching $150 per hour
5:58:35
or or more with projects bringing in 20K or more and here is a very important
5:58:41
note as a freelancer you have to keep in mind that you are responsible for paying your own taxes right including income
5:58:48
tax and self-employment tax you know depending on where you live Additionally you will need to account for other
5:58:54
expenses such as health insurance retirement savings and other business costs which are typically covered by
5:59:01
Employers in traditional in-house roles proper financial planning and setting aside for taxes are essential to
5:59:07
maintaining the sustainability and profitability of your freelance business but uh don't worry though because in
5:59:14
module six I will teach you how to manage your freelance finances effectively so you can Thrive both
5:59:19
professionally and financially all right so now let's talk about what's next after having success
5:59:26
as a designer the next step is to create your own agency and education/ Consulting business or both like I'm
5:59:33
doing it's very important to teach others because by doing so you will learn a lot and you will also
5:59:39
potentially change the lives of uh some of the people who consume your content and also understand that by building an
5:59:46
agency or an education business you can make a lot more money than just by freelancing and obviously by being a
5:59:53
simple employee however it's also very important not to rush the process all right start by gaining experience as a
6:00:00
freelancer or employee then gradually work your way up and as I said this is
6:00:06
exactly what I'm doing I've been a freelance designer for a while and now I'm working towards stepping to the next
6:00:12
phase some of you might be content by just staying as a um freelancer forever
6:00:18
traveling the world and enjoying the quality time you know with your family and that's okay and it can be very
6:00:24
fulfilling and less stressful then running your own Agency for example right but for some of you who are uh a
6:00:31
little more ambitious finding ways to expand and scale could be very
6:00:36
interesting and then the next step is to invest some of the money you make with your business into assets that will
6:00:43
eventually make you more money I will make a lot of content about this next phase as I grow and discover new
6:00:49
strategies that work for me and might work for you in this lesson you learned about the different salaries for in
6:00:55
office and remote designers and also about the next steps after years of experience and success the modules
6:01:02
exercise is to complete the clarity survey if you haven't already if it takes only 5 minutes but can be crucial
6:01:08
for shaping your next 10 or even 20 years so take action oh and there is
6:01:13

6:05:11
saying that these platforms are the best and all people saying that these platforms are the worst so opinions vary
6:05:18
but I will tell you my own experience these platforms are okay when you are starting out and want to gain some
6:05:23
experience and testimonials I've hired people from appwork for some of my businesses mostly virtual assistants and
6:05:29
social media managers but there are better and more uh lucrative ways to get
6:05:35
clients these platforms are notorious for their fees and also you'll be competing on
6:05:41
price with other designers which is not ideal you need to be charging um high prices almost always all right but
6:05:49
charging high prices is not as simple as just putting together a quick portfolio putting your services at the high price
6:05:56
and call it a day all right it's not how it works it's a science and an art and

6:06:39
specific area you can attract high quality clients more easily and build a reputation that sets you apart from
6:06:45
generalist designers so what's a niche a niche is a specific segment of a market that you choose to focus on it can be
6:06:52
defined by a particular industry type of client or a specific need within the market for web designer selecting a
6:06:59
niche means narrowing your focus to serve a specific group of clients for example e-commerce businesses creating
6:07:06
professionals or local small businesses and these are broad niches right you can
6:07:11
narrow them even further to Target a more specific Audience by specializing in a niche you position yourself as an
6:07:18

6:07:25
we'll explore the importance of selecting a niche how to choose the right one for you and how it can impact
6:07:31
your success as a web designer we'll also incorporate Concepts from the blue
6:07:36
ocean red ocean and purple ocean strategies to help you navigate this process effectively don't worry if you
6:07:42
are unfamiliar with these strategies I will explain them in detail and if you are already familiar great what I will
6:07:49
show you will reinforce and expand your knowledge now I will explain you what red oceans and blue oceans are all right
6:07:57
so let me show you an example with this diagram so here we have the market all right this rectangle and then we have
6:08:03
some dots inside of the rectangle the dots represent the freelance designers that live and compete inside
6:08:10
of the market and here we have a beginner all right so this dot right
6:08:16
here is a beginner freelance web designer so what happens is that when
6:08:21
people um complete a boot camp or a course they jump straight into the
6:08:27
market all right so right here and then this Market is very
6:08:33
competitive so they try a lot of strategies and a lot of things and no you know nothing seems to work and they
6:08:40
wonder why they be like wow I've been here like I don't know for a year or for two years 3 years 10 years and nothing
6:08:47
seems to work and that's because they don't you know they don't innovate they just go into a market try to copy
6:08:54
everyone and they don't do anything uh new or anything different right to
6:08:59
differentiate themselves so what happens is that they feel stuck because they are
6:09:04
competing against all these other Freelancers doing the same strategies
6:09:10
that everyone else is doing and then when I say nothing new or different I'm not talking about Reinventing the wheel
6:09:16
all right I'm talking about approaching business differently it's like don't follow the crowd create your own lane in
6:09:22
order to win and I will show you exactly how to do that because you don't want to be uh the average designer fighting here
6:09:30
in the red Ocean Market all right if you stay in this market you'll be competing on price all day and trust me that's
6:09:37
exhausting all right and here we have the Blue Ocean Market and this Market would be like the dream market for a
6:09:44
beginner right because let's say all right so this is a beginner all right
6:09:49
and then jumps here in this market and then there is very low competition and
6:09:54
then you know you know the beginner can swim and then there is a lot of opportunities and a lot of business and
6:10:01
everything is great all right and since there is not a lot of competition um this freelancer this new freelancer
6:10:08
can charge high prices and everything is cool and yes that's exactly how blue
6:10:14
ocean markets are at the beginning but the problem is that when other
6:10:19
competitors um you know see the landscape and the opportunities in the market they would obviously want to jump
6:10:27
right into the market and and just like um do business just like this U freelancer is doing okay they want to be
6:10:34
here as well and get business and everything but the problem is when a lot of other Freelancers jump into this
6:10:41
Market this is what happens it turns into a red ocean and then the freelancer
6:10:48
that before um enjoyed a very calm and amazing and beautiful blue ocean now is
6:10:56
chasing other blue oceans and trying to find another blue ocean and that's exhausting so let me introduce you to a
6:11:04
more sustainable ocean the Purple Ocean and the Purple Ocean is basically
6:11:10
a red ocean that has some blue ocean pools inside and the Freelancers that are
6:11:18
inside of their own uh blue ocean pool these are the Freelancers that thrive
6:11:25
right I want you to be one of these Freelancers that are in a very
6:11:30
competitive but profitable Market okay because in this market there is a lot of comp competition and that means that
6:11:37
this Market is validated right it means that there is a lot of money being made here and some of these Freelancers make
6:11:44
no money some of them make a little bit of money and some others make a lot of money right it's possible to make a lot
6:11:50
of money being part of a red ocean especially if you I don't know if you have like capital and you are investing
6:11:57
in a lot of advertising and and and all that stuff you can have some advantages the problem is that you will always be
6:12:04
under threat right because all these other Freelancers are going to be fighting against you and you don't want
6:12:10
to be there you have to approach business differently so you are inside of your own blue ocean pool like these
6:12:18
three Freelancers thriving in a validated market and this doesn't mean
6:12:23
that all these people will just sit here and look as you uh succeed right they
6:12:30
will try to destroy your barrier and try to get um inside of your own uh market
6:12:36
right your own pool and then they will try to be there okay so what you have to
6:12:42
do is that you have to build a mode all right and if you don't know what a mode is in business I will let you know in a
6:12:50
second so here is a castle okay and then the water surrounding the castle is the
6:12:58
mod all right so it's basically a trench filled with water and um it was used for
6:13:04
protection especially during the Middle Ages so basically if the enemy wanted to
6:13:10
attack the castle let's say these Knights are the enemy they would have to go through the uh mod right and the mod
6:13:17
was very deep and then they had uh heavy armor and then weapons and then they had
6:13:23
some um horses right so it was very difficult for them to reach the castle
6:13:30
and then the castle also had some guards right here maybe surrounding the castle
6:13:36
and then outside as well fighting all right and here so it was very difficult for the
6:13:44
enemy to reach and attack the castle it was possible but very
6:13:49
challenging and I'm using this metaphor because it has its parallels with business the castle represents your
6:13:55
freelance business and then you have some kingdoms that are your quote unquote enemies AKA other Freelancers
6:14:01
who are your competitors however not all Freelancers will be only competitors right some will also be strategic
6:14:07
Partners the same way kingdoms used to have Partnerships with other kingdoms the mode represents the unique value or
6:14:14
competitive advantage that protects your business just like a mode protects a castle from attacks your mode might be
6:14:21
your specialized skills strong client relationships exceptional Service delivery or a unique Niche you've
6:14:28
discovered and manag to dominate with a constant Innovation the mode makes it
6:14:34
harder for competitors to invade your territory and helps ensure the success
6:14:39
and security of your freance business all right let's go back to the Purple Ocean Market and let's illustrate how a
6:14:47
mode would look inside of this market so this freelancer has a mode
6:14:53
because this freelancer built an amazing personal brand has a good reputation and is always innovating on the other hand
6:15:00
we have this freelancer right here with a very weak barrier and without OTE
6:15:05
because this designer is never innovating and started to receive a lot of negative reviews due to poor um
6:15:12
Service delivery and this guy right here is already gone because he's about to join the red ocean and probably give up
6:15:19
because um you know competition will be fierce so as we can see here the one that was here is not here anymore it's
6:15:25
already off you know swimming in the red ocean and then this one you know is
6:15:31
going to struggle because the barrier is very weak right and then this one is going to thrive
6:15:38
because he keeps innovating and delivering Excellence every time okay so
6:15:43
pay attention to what I have to say right now because it's very important a smart approach to expanding your web
6:15:48
design business is to Target emerging countries where the demand for digitalization is on the rise Emerging
6:15:53
Markets often have a growing need for Web Design Services as they undergo digital transformation making them
6:16:00
fertile ground for new opportunities to identify these markets is suggest starting with a global view use tools
6:16:07
like Google Maps for example to explore different regions and later identify countries showing signs of
6:16:13
growth however I won't provide a specific list of Emerging Markets here
6:16:18
doing so could lead to a necessary saturation which might overwhelm local businesses and reduce opportunities for
6:16:25
everyone all right instead I encourage you to think strategically and leverage AI tools for market research Below in
6:16:33
the description you will find a list of effective chat GPT prompts to help you identify promising
6:16:39
markets additionally and this is very exciting I'll be hosting private life
6:16:44
workshops on market and Niche research within our private Community where I'll guide some of you in finding potentially
6:16:51
lucrative markets these workshops are free but you must be a member of our
6:16:57
community to participate so if you are not a member already join us today and let's explore these opportunities
6:17:04
together and and also if you have any questions about anything web design related just let me know in the comments
6:17:11
now that you understand the concepts of red oceans blue oceans and purple oceans let's discuss how to apply this strategy
6:17:17
to your Niche selection number one look for un deserved markets within popular niches
6:17:23
even in highly competitive niches there are often sub niches or specific client needs that aren being fully addressed
6:17:30
for example in the e-commerce space you might focus on sustainable brands or business businesses that prioritize
6:17:36
eco-friendly practices this allows you to stand out within a broader Market
6:17:41
while still tapping into existing demand number two use data to identify opportunities just like the Purple Ocean
6:17:48
strategy suggest use data driven insights to find areas of unmet demand
6:17:53
within your chosen Niche researching online Behavior search Trends and Industry forums can reveal what
6:18:00
potential clients are searching for but not easily finding this approach helps you discover small uncontested spaces
6:18:07
where you can offer unique value while this might sound complex tools like chat DPT can help simplify the process by
6:18:13
guiding you on where to look and how to interpret the data so here's an example imagine we are targeting luxury or
6:18:20
vacation rentals we would leverage chat DPT to discover key trends in luxury
6:18:25
vacation rental websites asking questions like what are affluent Travelers looking for in luxury vacation
6:18:32
rental websites then gbt will provide insights into the demand for features
6:18:38
such as high quality visuals intuitive navigation and seamless booking experiences tailored to affluent clients
6:18:45
this is kind of generic but with the help of AI as a research tool we can always dig deeper we can also use tools
6:18:53
like CH DPT to dwell into the specific needs of luxury vacation rental clients
6:18:58
for instance we can ask something like how can web design enhance the experience for a highend uh vacation
6:19:06
rental websites something like that this can help you understand the importance of immersive design personalized content
6:19:13
and also Advanced booking systems and then at the end of the process with all
6:19:18
the insights gain and the um deep research complete you can position yourself as a specialist in web design
6:19:25
for luxury vacation rentals focusing on creating websites that offer elegant
6:19:30
design professional photography and you can collab with a photograph for for these or leverage AI depending on the
6:19:37
budget and we can't forget about providing a seamless user experience that reflects the exclusivity of these
6:19:44
properties you can deepen your understanding by joining online communities where luxury real estate and
6:19:50
travel professionals gather Studd shared information ask questions and observe discussions to better understand the
6:19:56
Market's needs then use AI to synthetize the insights you've gathered this
6:20:01
strategy can provide more valuable insights and help refine your service offering to better meet specific Market
6:20:07
demands number three differentiate your offer it's not just about choosing the right Niche but also about how you
6:20:13
position your offer within that Niche okay so avoid copying the same messaging
6:20:19
offers and strategies used by everyone else all right instead think critically about how you can differentiate your
6:20:26
services whether through unique features specialized expertise outstanding client management or a distinct brand tone and
6:20:34
voice voice all right to give you a clear picture of how to select a niche let's look at different levels of Niche
6:20:40
specialization I will also give you a list of niches at the end of this module because I'm sure there will be a lot of
6:20:46
interesting niches you've never thought about first let's talk about what's a
6:20:51
niche within an industry instead of offering Web Design Services to everyone you could focus on an affluent Niche
6:20:58
like creating websites specifically for luxury y stter companies that serve wealthy clients this Niche lets you um
6:21:05
design websites that meet the high standards of these exclusive customers by focusing on a niche like this one for
6:21:12
example you could attract clients who not only want high quality designs but also are willing to pay more for a
6:21:18
website that shows off the luxury and exclusivity of their services now let's
6:21:23
talk about broad Niche examples a broad Niche might be something like e-commerce websites this Niche targets all types of
6:21:30
online stores across various Industries why it's still more specific
6:21:35
than being a general web designer that designs for any Niche is Broad in the sense that it covers a wide range of
6:21:42
businesses from clothing stores to digital product sellers now let's talk
6:21:47
about more specific Niche examples a more specific Niche could be e-commerce websites for eco-friendly and
6:21:54
sustainable Brands this focuses on a particular type of e-commerce business with a specific value proposition by
6:22:01
narrowing down your niche in this way you can become the goto design ER for businesses that prioritize
6:22:07
sustainability which allows you to tailor your designs to reflect eco-friendly values such as minimalistic
6:22:13
designs efficiency and emphasizing environmentally conscious practices okay so how to select the
6:22:20
right Niche I will give you five tips number one reflect on your interest and passions start by thinking about what
6:22:27
Industries or types of clients you are more interested in like what are you passionate about right whether it's
6:22:33
e-commerce health and wellness real estate or creative Industries selecting a niche that excites you will make your
6:22:40
work more enjoyable and fulfilling and also it's like when you are passionate about something it doesn't feel like
6:22:46
work number two assess your skills and experience look at your existing skills and experience do you have a background
6:22:52
in a particular industry or have you worked with clients in a specific field before because that's very relevant
6:22:59
leveraging your previous experience can give you a head start in establishing credibility your chosen Niche number
6:23:06
three research market demand it's important to ensure that there is demand for your services in your chosen Niche
6:23:12
do some research to see if businesses in that industry are actively seeking Web Design Services tools like LinkedIn or
6:23:19
industry specific forums communities can help you check the interest and identify potential clients and ideas number four
6:23:26
consider profitability not all niches are equally profitable all right some Industries have higher budgets for web
6:23:32
design While others might be more price sensitive think about whether your chosen Niche can support the pricing
6:23:38
structure you want to implement if your goal is to build a high-end web design business you will want to focus on
6:23:46
industries that can afford premium services and last but not least number five evaluate the competition check out
6:23:53
other web designers working in your potential Niche while some competition is healthy you don't want to enter a
6:23:59
market that's already oversaturated with a specialist on the other hand if there
6:24:04
is a very little competition it might be a sign that the niche isn't profitable
6:24:09
or in demand so make sure that you do your homework before entering a market
6:24:14
finding balance is key in this Google sheet I've compiled a variety of niches you can choose from pick three to five
6:24:22
do thorough research and commit to one and only one until you've secured at
6:24:27
least 5 to 10 happy clients and I want to emphasize the word happy many people
6:24:33
tend to switch niches when they encounter difficulties or major challenges don't be that person because
6:24:40
you will encounter difficulties in every Niche becoming a successful web designer is not easy becoming a millionaire is
6:24:47
not easy doing anything worthwhile is not easy and you are here right now so
6:24:53
you are on your way and what I mean with that is stick with your chosen Niche long enough to see significant results
6:25:00
once you've gained experience and master the fundamentals of freelancing you can
6:25:05
consider switching niches if you feel is right that's called pivoting and it's smart depending on the
6:25:11
circumstances but remember the best way to grow is by doing real work and facing challenges
6:25:17
headon and obviously you know I teach you everything in theer right so here is also a survey you can complete that will
6:25:25
tell you if the niche you are thinking of is viable or not in this lesson
6:25:30
you've learned what the nich is what blue oceans red oceans and purple oceans are how to apply the Purple Ocean
6:25:35
strategy to Niche selection and how to select the right niche in this lesson we will talk about
6:25:42
why it's crucial to have at least three to four concept projects completed before you begin any cold or warm
6:25:48
Outreach whether you are just starting out in web design or transitioning into the field having these concept projects
6:25:54
in your portfolio is a key step to building credibility showcasing your skills and gaining the confidence to
6:26:00
reach out to potential clients and don't worry about how to build a portfolio right now because in module 10 I will
6:26:07
show you how to build a strong portfolio from design to development to publication let's explore why concept
6:26:14
projects matter when you are new to web design one of the biggest challenges is proving your capabilities without a
6:26:20
track record of real world projects concept projects is what you need to bridge the gap they allow you to
6:26:27
demonstrate your design skills creativity and problem solving abilities even if you haven't worked with paying
6:26:33
clients yet now let's dive into four key reasons why concept projects are
6:26:38
essential for new web designers looking to build a strong foundation and attract potential clients number one concept
6:26:46
projects give you the opportunity to showcase your abilities these projects can be completely fictional or redesigns
6:26:53
of existing websites but they should be treated as if they were for real clients
6:26:58
by putting in the effort to create polish professional designs you demonstrate to potential clients that
6:27:03
you have necessary skills to deliver quality work in many cases concept projects can be more compelling than
6:27:09
degrees since they provide concrete evidence of your capabilities focusing on what you can actually do rather than
6:27:16
just what you've learned or memorized the shift reflects your brother train in modern times where practical skills and
6:27:23
demonstrable outcomes are increasingly valued over traditional credentials particularly in fields like art and
6:27:30
Technology number two concept projects build up your confidence how having three to four solid coner projects under
6:27:36
your belt gives you the confidence to approach potential clients instead of feeling hesitant or uncertain about your
6:27:42
abilities you can proudly present your work this confidence is essential when you are doing Outreach whether it's cold
6:27:49
or warm when you believe in your work it shows right and that energy is
6:27:55
contagious number three they also help you provide visual proof when you are
6:28:00
reaching out to prospects they are going to want to see examples of your work cancer projects provide that visual
6:28:07
proof it's much easier to convince someone to take a chance on you when they can see firsthand what you are
6:28:13
capable of right so these projects allow you to back up your pit with tangible
6:28:18
evidence making your outre effort much more effective and finally number four they help you tailor your portfolio so
6:28:26
coner projects also allow you to tailor your portfolio to the type of work you want to attract if you are interested in
6:28:33
working with her Niche businesses for example you can create concept projects that cater to that specific Niche this
6:28:39
helps you attract the right clients and positions you as someone who understands their specific needs now that you
6:28:45
understand the importance of concept projects let's talk about how to create them effectively first go through the
6:28:51
list I prepare for you click the link in the description label concept project ideas to open the Google sheet I prepare
6:28:57
think about which ones excite you the most and align with the type of work you want to attract this is your chance to
6:29:03
choose projects that truly resonate with your design style and goals and this is going to help you avoid paralysis
6:29:09
analysis right because you have the description everything nicely packaged and now you just have to read the
6:29:16
description and then get to work now select three to four project ideas that you feel confident about and that allow
6:29:22
you to Showcase a wide range of your skills you could also use the same concept project for multiple brands or
6:29:29
businesses within a niche for example if your focus is luxury vacation rental you
6:29:34
could create three different booking and showcase websites for various businesses within the same Niche if your goal is to work with
6:29:42
agencies I recommend creating multiple projects that are distinct from each other meaning for different niches for
6:29:49
example you could design one for a SAS company another for a dental implant clinic and a third one for an e-commerce
6:29:55
brand this variety will highlight your versatility as a web designer now take
6:30:01
everything you've learned from the previous moduls and apply it to these concept projects start by creating a
6:30:06
brief for each project Define the goals target audience and the specific
6:30:11
features you want to include this will give you a clear road map for executing each project
6:30:18
successfully and also if your potential client asks you um about your process
6:30:24
you will be able to provide a clear explanation this is very important as you begin working on each project focus
6:30:31
on delivering the highest quality possible and and I want to emphasize this all right use the design principles
6:30:37
tools and strategies you've learned whether it's creating wireframes or personal profiles designing a responsive
6:30:44
layout you know or optimizing the user experience make sure every detail reflects your best work strive for
6:30:51
excellence in every aspect of the project to ensure your final designs are of super high quality make sure to share
6:30:58

6:31:54

6:32:01
serve as a strong Foundation when reaching out to potential clients demonstrating that you have the skills
6:32:06
and creativity needed to deliver high quality web design all right so as a conclusion before you start reaching out
6:32:13
to potential clients please please please take time to create three to four
6:32:19
strong concept projects these projects are your keys to start seeing early
6:32:25

6:32:32

6:32:37
Outreach efforts remember your portfolio is often the first visual impression you
6:32:42
will make so Make It Count now that you understand the importance of concept projects you'll be better prepared to
6:32:48
engage in both cold and warm Outreach with the tools you need to make a strong impression and start getting clients in
6:32:54
this lesson you've learned why caner projects matter and how to start working on your cancer projects let's move to
6:33:00
the next lesson in this lesson we'll talk about how to effectively get clients when starting out the first step
6:33:06
is to identify what leverage you currently have if you don't have money or connections you can have patience
6:33:13
which is free but highly valuable like gold ancient wisdom and obviously this
6:33:19
course you have your brain and wealth of intelligence and you also have time so I
6:33:26
do not want to hear any excuses all right if you are following everything I'm teaching you a toz I will be very
6:33:33
surprise if you don't make it so first of all I want to tell you that leverage
6:33:39
doesn't always mean money okay patience is one of your greatest assets you have
6:33:44
to be patient when starting out you should work for free and I'm not suggesting to do websites for everyone
6:33:50
right even though that could be somehow effective it's not time effective so you have to be very precise and selective to
6:33:58
home you work for free let's say that there is a new jewelry store in your area that's selling high end to affluent
6:34:04
clients you do a little research first then see if they already have a website if they don't or their website is
6:34:11
outdated and with a terrible user interface you could go there and tell them that you are starting out a
6:34:16
freelance web design business and that you are willing to do their website totally for free um because you need to
6:34:23
build up some case studies to get paid clients in the future here is how the conversation could go first you will
6:34:30
explain how a professionally designed website can improve their online presence attract more customers and
6:34:36
showcase their beautiful jewelry in the best way possible highlight how this can help their business grow and stand out
6:34:42
in a competitive market after explaining the benefits you will ask if they are interested in moving forward if they are
6:34:49
interested you can then introduce the free web design offer showing it as a no risk opportunity for them to see what a
6:34:55
stunning and functional website can do for them in this case you will offer both design and no code development and
6:35:02
don't worry about the velopment part because you will learn how to do it in MA 10 don't be intimidated because it's
6:35:09
not that difficult and remember not to talk about features all right don't be like the website will be built with
6:35:16
responsive design custom Widgets or SEO optimized content that's what rookies do all right instead focus on the benefits
6:35:22
on how it will solve their problems or meet their needs and here is an example instead of saying oh this website is
6:35:29
going to be SEO optimized and you know all this stuff you can say this website
6:35:34
will help you attract more affluent customers by showcasing your jewelry in a luxurious visually stunning online
6:35:40
environment that mirrors the high quality experience they expect in
6:35:45
person and Then followed by saying something like I understand that translating the Elegance of your
6:35:51
physical store into the digital space can uh be challenging and this website
6:35:56
will solve that by offering a seamless White Glove online experience and then reinforce this statement by saying
6:36:03
something like this this consistency not only reinforces your Brand's Prestige but also makes it easier for customers
6:36:10
to engage with your brand and purchase your PC whether they are browsing online or decide to visit your store in person
6:36:17
it ensures that you stand out in a competitive market by delivering the same level of sophistication and
6:36:23
exclusivity across all touch points so here are the problems we'll solve by
6:36:29
ensuring consistency across channels this website will address the issue of in consistent branding between the
6:36:34
physical store and the online store it will also enhance customer engagement by
6:36:40
effectively reaching and captivating affluent customers online ultimately increasing sales additionally it will
6:36:46
help their brand stand up from competitors by offering a seamless highend experience both online and
6:36:52
offline something many retailers struggle to achieve all right so this consistency not only increases their
6:36:58
brands value but also opens up more opportunities for funding and more market share expansion okay if they are
6:37:06
not interested respect their decision but keep the door open by asking if it's
6:37:11
okay to follow up later don't be pushy and don't try to force the sale um also
6:37:16
ask if they know anyone else who might be interested if they say that they might be interested in the future set a
6:37:23
specific follow-up date and keep them engaged by sharing examples of your work and any additional information they
6:37:30
might find helpful it's important that if you are targeting this Niche for example you already have some stunning
6:37:37
concept projects of highend jewelry websites if they see the talent and honesty they will most likely agree now
6:37:45
since you already have one real client even though you did it for free you can try to pay your pay services to other
6:37:52
potential clients let's explore the power of no as I mentioned earlier
6:37:58
patience is your greatest asset no one worthwhile wants to work with someone who seems desperate
6:38:04
when you offer something and it's rejected don't be quick to offer discounts this can make you appear
6:38:11
desperate and cause you to lose respect in the marketplace always stand your ground and
6:38:17
be prepared to say no interestingly though when you say no something almost
6:38:22
magical happens people respect you more and want you more it's basically Psychology 101 people desire what they
6:38:30
cannot easily have and I understand that when when you have rent to pay it's tempting to accept any project that
6:38:37
comes your way right I've been there but operating in a survival mode is not
6:38:43
where you want to be to truly Excel you need to move Beyond Survival Mode which
6:38:48
will give you the patience and confidence to make better decisions however it's possible to operate in
6:38:54
survival mode and still say no I've done it all right I've turn down PID deals
6:38:59
that didn't feel right even when I needed the money it takes courage a high tolerance for discomfort which is
6:39:05
something you can train over time if your pain threshold isn't as strong yet
6:39:11
take it step by step Focus first on getting out of survival mode and then as
6:39:16
you gain more stability start increasing your leverage by rejecting deals that don't align with your financial goals
6:39:23
now let's talk about the different types of leads when working as a web designer it's important to understand the
6:39:29
different types of leads you might encounter identifying and categorizing leads can help you tailor your approach
6:39:35
and increase your chances of closing deals here are the most common types of
6:39:40
leads in the web design world number one cold leads cold leads are prospects or
6:39:45
potential clients who may not be familiar with your services or your business they haven't shown direct
6:39:52
interest yet but you might reach out to them through advertising social media or called outre like emails or phone calls
6:40:00
converting call leads requires building trust and showcase in the value of your web design Services number two worm
6:40:07
leads worm leads are individuals or businesses who have shown some interest in your services but haven't yet
6:40:13
committed to hiring you they might have visited your portfolio followed you on social media or downloaded a free
6:40:20
resource you offer them and these leads need uh nurturing okay often through
6:40:26
follow-up emails phone calls or sharing portfolio work to help them move closer
6:40:31
to making a decision three had leads had leads are prospects who are ready to
6:40:36
make a decision these are typically people who have expressed a strong interest in your services such as
6:40:43
filling out a form uh you know scheding a consultation or requesting a quote and
6:40:50
H leads need immediate attention because they are closer to committing and the right proposal or conversation can seal
6:40:56
the deal number four referral leads referral leads come through recommendations from previous clients
6:41:02
business partners or other professionals these leads often have a higher conversion rate because they already
6:41:08
trust your work uh based on someone else's positive experience and the treating referral
6:41:13
leads with our priority is important as they can quickly become loyal clients and bring in more referral leads number
6:41:20
five inbound leads inbound leads are those who find you through your online presence such as your portfolio blog
6:41:26
social media or ads these leads are seeking you out because they are already interested in your web design services
6:41:33
they typically have a problem to solve and are looking for a web designer who can meet their needs and this is why
6:41:40
having a strong personal brand is very important and the good thing is that if you focus on getting better every day
6:41:47
and then putting out your work out in the world so people can see it you will be building your uh personal brand
6:41:53
slowly but Surly I will be posting content in our private Community about how to build a personal brand as I
6:41:59
progress and build mine number six outbound leads outbound leads are
6:42:04
generated through proactive Outreach where you initiate contact with potential clients this can include call
6:42:10
calling emailing or networking outbound leads often need more effort to convert
6:42:16
but with the right approach they can become valuable clients now let's talk about warm Outreach AKA leveraging
6:42:23
existing relationships one of the best ways to get clients especially when starting out is through warm Outreach unlike cold
6:42:30
Outreach which involves contacting complete strangers warm Outreach focuses on reaching out to people who already
6:42:37
know you in some capacity this could be on former colleagues friends family
6:42:42
members or past clients essentially anyone with whom you've had some form of
6:42:47
contact the key advantage of warm Outreach is that these individuals already have some level of trust in you
6:42:54
even if they aren't fully aware of uh what you currently offer this existing
6:42:59
trust makes them more likely to engage with you and consider your services when you begin your warm Outreach it's
6:43:05
crucial to approach it as a reconnection rather than a direct cell speech you might start by reintroducing yourself
6:43:12
and sharing what you have been up to personally and or professionally for
6:43:18
instance you can position the conversation as a catch up by saying something like this hey it's been a
6:43:23
while and I wanted to reconnect how is everything going though what are you working on these days this naturally
6:43:29
lowers the guard of the person you are reaching out to most likely they will respond with something like hey
6:43:34
everything is great I'm working on this and that how about you and this gives
6:43:40
you the perfect opportunity to continue the conversation you can then reply with
6:43:45
something like this nice that sounds exciting I've been working on building my portfolio as a web designer and I'm
6:43:51
currently offering a web design service totally for free because I want to gather testimonials and start growing my
6:43:58
business um do you know anybody who might be interested this approach feels more genuine and less sales oriented
6:44:05
making the other person more receptive to your message also asking if they know anybody who might be interested it's
6:44:11
called indirect pitch strategy is a powerful approach that shifts the traditional sales Dynamic from a direct
6:44:18
pitch to a more subtle and effective method of generating interest and leads
6:44:24
so instead of asking someone directly if they need your services you inquire if they know someone else who might benefit
6:44:31
this approach is rooted in a psych ology and social dynamics and it can be particularly effective for a few key
6:44:37
reasons number one reducing sales pressure one of the primary benefits of the undirect pitch strategy is that it
6:44:44
significantly reduces the pressure that often a company's direct sales pitches like when you ask someone um if
6:44:52
they personally need your services they might feel put on this part or defensive
6:44:58
even if they could actually benefit from what you are offering by shifting Thea as to whether they know someone else who
6:45:04
might be interested you remove the direct pressure on them this allows them
6:45:10
to think more clearly and honestly about whether they or someone else in their Network could benefit from your services
6:45:17
for example as I previously explained instead of saying would you be interested in my web design Services you
6:45:23
say something like do you know anyone who might need a website the subtle
6:45:29
change in language invites them to consider your offer without feeling like they need to make an immediate decision
6:45:34
for themselves it's powerful number two tapping into social networks another
6:45:41
significant advantage of this strategy is that it Taps into the social networks of the people you are speaking to even
6:45:48
if the person you are talking to doesn't need your services they might know someone who does all right by asking if
6:45:54
they know someone um who could benefit you are essentially expending your reach Beyond just that person this is
6:46:01
particularly valuable because referral from someone within a network often carry more weight and Trust than a
6:46:06
called introduction for instance when you ask do you know anyone who might be interested in a website the person might
6:46:13
start thinking about their friends colleagues or even their own business needs in some cases they might say uh
6:46:20
actually uh I could use that service or they might refer you to someone they know giving you a warm uh introduction
6:46:27
that can lead to a more successful interaction number three leveraging psychological reciprocity
6:46:33
the indirect pit strategy also leverages the principle of reciprocity in social psychology it's like when you ask
6:46:40
someone for a recommendation you are suddenly position them as an expert in their Network this makes them feel good
6:46:48
about helping you out and it often creates a sense of obligation um to
6:46:54
return the favor by either referring someone else or even considering your offer for themselves this psychological
6:47:01
nudge can lead to more positive responses than a direct sales approach
6:47:06
because you are not only asking for a favor right um You are also positioning
6:47:11
the other person as someone who can connect people and provide value to others which can make them more inclin
6:47:19
to help you okay number four softening the sales conversation the indirect
6:47:25
pitch softens the sales conversation by turning it into a more collaborative effort it changes the dynamic from I'm
6:47:32
trying trying to sell you something to I'm looking to help someone and maybe
6:47:38
you can assist me in finding them see the difference this repositioning makes
6:47:44
the conversation feel more like a partnership where the person you are speaking with is helping you out rather
6:47:51
than being so to this can lead to a more open and positive discussion where the individual feels less like a Target and
6:47:58
more like a valued part of your network for example rather than putting the person in a position where they feel um
6:48:04
they need to justify whether or not they need your service you are asking for
6:48:09
their help in connecting you with others and this leads to a more comfortable and
6:48:14
organic conversation which can ultimately result in a warmer reception to your offer number five increasing the
6:48:21
likelihood of referrals and conversions by using the undirect pit strategy you increase the likelihood of generating or
6:48:28
referral in conversions in this case conversions means service El all right
6:48:34
even if the person you are speaking to doesn't um immediately recognize their own need for your service the idea is
6:48:41
now planted in their mind they might think of someone else right away or they might realize later that they actually
6:48:48
could use your services either way you've open the door right without pushing them through it and also since
6:48:54
referrals typically come with a level of trust already established leads generated through this method are often
6:49:01
warmer and more likely to convert into clients if someone is referred to you by
6:49:06
a friend social media connection or family member they are more likely to trust your expertise and be open to
6:49:12
working with you compared to um you know a cold lead it's very important to
6:49:18
remember that you should never ever try to sell something to someone who doesn't
6:49:23
need it all right only offer a product or service when you genuinely believe it
6:49:28
can solve a problem they have for example if you are offering a web design service and someone declines do not try
6:49:36
to push the sell all right or you know create unnecessary reasons for them to
6:49:41
buy and also don't be misleading and don't overpromise instead as we discussed
6:49:48
simply ask if uh they might need the service in the future if they say no respect their decision and let them know
6:49:56
that it's perfectly fine always communicate with Elegance you can gently mention that you
6:50:02
will check in with them down the road in case they are working on a new project or something changes and they might then
6:50:10
need a website this approach not only builds trust but also positions you as a
6:50:16
professional who respects their needs and timing in the long run this will lead to Stronger relationships and more
6:50:23
meaningful business opportunities I will break down the entire sales process later in this
6:50:29
module now let's talk about why collaborating with agenc is easy
6:50:34
smart one of the easiest and most effective ways to gain experience and work on real projects is by
6:50:40
collaborating with agencies agencies already have established clients so you don't need to worry about generating
6:50:46
leads yourself plus many successful agencies are constantly on the lookout for talented Freelancers to help them
6:50:53
with their workload here are four reasons why this approach is smart
6:50:58
number one access to real projects without the stress of having to find direct clients by working with an agency
6:51:05
you can focus on your craft rather than worrying about where your next client is coming from agencies handle client
6:51:12
adquisition leaving you free to concentrate on delivering great work number two showcase your skills and
6:51:18
build relationships if you are just starting out offering to do a project or two for free can be a smart move but you
6:51:25
have to be very mindful when offering to work for free though your wording is very important and it has to be
6:51:31
compelling and honest otherwise they might not perceive the value you are offering they have to see your talent
6:51:37
and that's why having great concept projects is essential this allows the agency to see your work firstand and if
6:51:44
they like what they see they are more likely to offer you paid projects in the future once you've established yourself
6:51:50
as a a reliable freelancer agencies are likely to return to you for more work
6:51:55
number three you could get the chance to work with a big Brands even as a beginner working with agencies can give
6:52:01
you the opportunity to contribute to projects for major companies like Nike Amazon Apple or Google while your role
6:52:08
in these projects might be small being able to say that you've work on projects for big names can be a game changer for
6:52:15
your career these case studies can open doors to new opportunities that you might not have imagined possible it's
6:52:21
important to be aware that many agencies and big companies include confidentiality claes in their contracts
6:52:27
which might restrict you from publicly showcasing the work you've done for them
6:52:33
these Clauses are often referred to as non-disclosure agreements or ndas um
6:52:38
however in most cases you can still share your work privately depending on the terms of the contract even if you
6:52:44
can't display the work in your portfolio having the experience and the contacts
6:52:50
can be incredibly valuable and here is a pro tip if the NDA restricts you from
6:52:57
discussing specific details of the project you can still Leverage The Brand Association in your portfolio and this
6:53:04
is extremely powerful for example you can include the company's logo and
6:53:09
mention that your work is under NDA this is a common practice among experienced and smart Freelancers who
6:53:16
have worked on confidential projects and it still allows you to demonstrate your involvement with well-known Brands
6:53:23
additionally always give credit where credit is Du all right mention the agency that hire you for the project
6:53:30
this shows integrity and acknowledges the collaboration which can further enhance your credibility and
6:53:36
professional relationships now let's talk about how to reach out to agencies reaching out to agencies follows a
6:53:42
similar process to called Outreach for direct clients here's how you do it
6:53:47
number one identify the right contacts start by finding key people within the agency such as recruiters or directors
6:53:54
and creative directors these people often have significant influence over freelance hiring decisions number two
6:54:01
connect with these people on LinkedIn add these individuals on LinkedIn and begin interacting with their content
6:54:07
engage with their post by liking commenting and sharing thoughtful insights this helps you get on their
6:54:14
radar before uh you reach out to them directly I've eded a video inside our
6:54:19
free private community that walks you through how to effectively find design agencies using LinkedIn and other
6:54:25
platforms I chose to upload this video there because these platforms frequently update their interfaces and it's easier
6:54:31
for me to keep up content up to date in a single video since I cannot edit videos that are already uploaded on
6:54:38
YouTube this approach allows me to stay current with platform changes number three send a personalized message when
6:54:45
you are ready send a personalized connection request or direct message you might mention how much you admire their
6:54:52
work or ask for a quick call to get some career advice people love to share their
6:54:57
expertise and if they see you are talented and eager to learn they will likely be open to helping you out during
6:55:04
the conversation you can naturally transition to discussing potential collaboration opportunities make sure
6:55:09
your LinkedIn profile looks clean and professional and never spam on people's
6:55:15
DMS or look desperate here is a message you can send and obviously don't send this exact message uh make sure to add
6:55:22
your own tone and voice and uh enhance it with uh you know with different words or whatever Hi and then you write the
6:55:29
name I have been following your work at know the name of the agency and really
6:55:34
admire the projects you are leading I am a freelance web designer looking to grow my career and I would
6:55:41
love to learn from someone with your experience would you be open to a quick 15-minute chat where I could get some
6:55:48
advice I'd really appreciate any insight you can share this approach is not only non-intrusive but also positions you as
6:55:55
someone who values learning and growth which is very appealing to potential collaborators and here is a pro tip when
6:56:03
scheduling a call offer a 10 to 15 minute window instead of 30 minutes or 1 hour okay because busy people may find
6:56:10
the longer commitments overwhelming and the thing is that once they agree to a short chat they will often stay longer
6:56:17
okay I've been on calls that were supposed to last for a few minutes but ended up lasting for an hour or even an
6:56:23
hour and a half if I had initially offer a longer call those meetings probably
6:56:29
wouldn't have happened so keep this in mind so in a nutshell here are the benefits
6:56:35
of agency work expense your network you will gain experience with diverse projects and then you will build
6:56:42
credibility Oh and before I forget I want to mention that it's a little bit more difficult to Niche down when you
6:56:47
are working with agencies but you can always Niche down later down the road
6:56:52
let's talk about how to actually contact people you might be asking who should I contact you mention using LinkedIn to
6:56:59
connect with people within agencies but are there other options to start the answer is simple start with your
6:57:05
existing Network use your phone go through your contact list and start messaging people if you have social
6:57:11
media accounts like Instagram LinkedIn or X formerly Twitter reach out to people there as well the key is not to
6:57:18
overthink right don't fall into the Trap of thinking no one of the people I have in my list needs a website they might
6:57:25
not need a website right now for themselves right but someone they know or even someone who knows someone they
6:57:31
know might need your services the point is to get the word out and create
6:57:37
opportunities procrastination is your enemy here right instead of waiting for the perfect moment or over analyzing
6:57:44
whether your contacts need your service or not take action right now start
6:57:49
reaching out reconnecting elaborating the indirect pitch strategy to build momentum all right the sooner you begin
6:57:56
the sooner you will start generating leads and converting them into clients while this module emphasizes this online
6:58:02
Outreach inperson networking becomes a powerful tool as you gain more experience attending industry events
6:58:09
local meetups or business expose allows you to form face-to-face connections that can lead to amazing business
6:58:15
relationships and long-term opportunities for beginners it can feel intimidating so start with online
6:58:22
methods first as your confidence grows consider exploring a smaller networking events or connecting with Professionals
6:58:28
in your Niche now I will explain how to convert called prospects into warm leads
6:58:33
through Linkedin and Instagram when it comes to converting called prospects into warm leads LinkedIn and Instagram
6:58:39
are powerful platforms that offer unique ways to engage with your target audience the key to success lies in building
6:58:46
relationships offering value and nurturing connections over time and also these are the tools alongside email I've
6:58:53
used myself to get clients so this is real experience here is a step-by-step strategy to turn cold prospects into
6:59:00
warm leads on these platforms number one optimize your profiles before you start reaching out to prospects make sure your
6:59:07
LinkedIn and Instagram profiles are optimized to reflect professionalism not necessarily corporate all right but you
6:59:13
have to Showcase your personality and expertise and I wanted to emphasize this your profiles should clearly communicate
6:59:20
who you are what you do and how you can help your target audience so on LinkedIn use a crisp and professional head shot
6:59:28
and craft a compelling headline and also write a summary to highlight your skills
6:59:33
experience and value proposition if you have previous experience in a particular Niche ensure that your work experience
6:59:40
skills and endorsements align with the niche you are targeting on Instagram create a bio that clearly states who you
6:59:46
are and what you do and who you help use a highquality profile picture and make sure your feed reflects your expertise
6:59:53
showcasing your work testimonials or insights related to your Niche you can also add some uh you know lifestyle
7:00:00
stuff to to make sure that people know that you are human number two reach out
7:00:06
to 100 people daily one of the most effective strategies for cold Outreach is to consistently reach out to a high
7:00:13
volume of prospects this consistent effort will increase your chances of finding prospects who resonate with your
7:00:20
message and are open to building a relationship and this is what I did
7:00:25
right this is my personal experience over the course of one month I reached out to 30 new prospects per day you know
7:00:33
people who had never heard of me as a result I was able to secure a couple of
7:00:38
gigs that total $50,000 over three and a half months patience is sko for instance
7:00:44
when Prospect got back to me like a month after I initially Reach Out showed interest then went silent for like a
7:00:51
month and then they finally returned with a confirmed offer and that was like
7:00:57
a uh you know like a big offer a $40,000 offer now in terms of of the number of
7:01:02
prospects I recommend you to aim even higher and I will give you an example in his book 100 million leads successful
7:01:08
entrepreneur Alex Orosi advice is reaching out to 100 people per
7:01:20
day by increasing your Outreach you can significantly boost your chances of Landing clients and achieving your
7:01:26
income goals even faster so you can take action and make it happen Okay start reaching out to 100 people per day the
7:01:33
more effort you put in the greater results you can achieve and here is how to implement this
7:01:40
strategy first set a uh daily goal commit to reach out to 100 New prospects
7:01:45
every single day this could include sending connection requests on LinkedIn and then talking to them DMS on
7:01:52
Instagram or sending emails I'm not going to talk about call calling because I've never done that so I want to stick
7:01:59
with strategies that I've used second stay organized keep track of who you've
7:02:04
contact and follow up regularly a simple spreadsheet or a CRM tool can help you
7:02:09
manage your Outreach efforts effectively I started with a Google sheet since it's free um and I will leave a link in the
7:02:16
description with the exact template I use while it's manual it's free and straightforward and as you gain more
7:02:23
experience you can optimize your organizational efforts with a CRM CRM stands for client relationship
7:02:29
management by constantly reaching out to a large number of prospects you increase the likelihood of finding those who are
7:02:36
interested in what you have to offer remember not everyone will respond but the key is in the numbers and being
7:02:42
persistent number three start with a personalized introduction cold Outreach
7:02:48
doesn't have to feel cold all right by personalizing your initial message you can make your first interaction or feel
7:02:55
more like a natural introduction rather than a self speech take the time to learn about your prospect before out
7:03:02
okay this is very important and use this information to craft a thoughtful message here is an example for LinkedIn
7:03:09
instead of sending a generic connection request personalize your message based on something specific you've noticed
7:03:15
about um you know their profile or recent activity for example hi you add the name I came across your profile and
7:03:22
notice your work in and then you add the industry or Niche your recent post on
7:03:27
you know the topic really resonates with me and I love to connect and learn more
7:03:33
about your approach and here's an example for Instagram start by engaging with their content you know like comment
7:03:40
or respond to their stories then send a DM that shows you are interested in their work for example you can say
7:03:47
something like hi you know the name I have been following um your content and a lot of your perspective on you know
7:03:54
the topic I would be thrilled to connect and explore potential collabs number four offer value upfront once you made
7:04:02
that initial connection focus on offering value before asking for anything in return this could be in the
7:04:07
form of useful content advice a book recommendation or resources that align with their interest or challenges the
7:04:14
key here is uh to show that you are not just another person trying to sell something all right you are genuinely
7:04:20
interested in helping them and here is an example so this is a prospect right and I reach out to them and I showed
7:04:27
them you know my expertise and also I showed them that I'm genuinely there to help them so I got their interest and
7:04:34
also an offer to potentially work with them and this example is a real example
7:04:40
okay it's me uh reaching out to an agency owner from Croatia so it's real it's in my DMs I do this all the time
7:04:48
because it's very effective and here is an example for you um on LinkedIn after
7:04:53
they accept your connection request send a follow-up message that provides value for example I notice that you are
7:05:00
working on you know the name of the project and thought that this article might be helpful it covers you know the topic in
7:05:07
depth and could provide some useful insights and on Instagram you can say something like I saw your post about you
7:05:14
know name of the challenge or whatever and thought you might find this you know tool or research helpful let me know if
7:05:20
you'd like more info I'm happy to help number five build trust through consistent
7:05:26
engagement building a strong relationship takes some time okay especially in C Outreach consistent
7:05:33
engagement is crucial for staying on their radar and slowly transitioning from a stranger to a trusted connection
7:05:39
comment on their post share relevant insights and keep the conversation going without pushing for a sell too soon
7:05:46
number six be honest and genuine if you try to fake this process it will rarely work in the long run you should be
7:05:53
honest about your intentions and show genuine interest in what they are working on and also who they are as a
7:05:59
person the thing is you shouldn't work with people you don't like and people
7:06:04
who don't like you will rarely want to work with you being kind and showing honesty is a powerful way of doing
7:06:11
business this authenticity not only makes your Outreach more effective but
7:06:17
also ensures that the relationships you build are strong and long lasting and here's an example on LinkedIn when
7:06:24
prospecting a collaboration be upfront about what you can deliver for example I
7:06:29
believe my skills in you know the area could complement your work in name of
7:06:34
the project and then you can end with something like I'd be happy to discuss how we can collaborate and ensure it's a
7:06:41
win-win for both of us and on Instagram in your DMs keep the tone friendly but
7:06:46
honest for example I think there is a um good Synergy between what we are both
7:06:51
doing and I would love to explore how we can work together so let's chat a little
7:06:57
bit more to see if there is a fit and these are just uh examples right so you
7:07:02
have to make sure that you are crafting the messages with your unique tone of voice number seven follow up and stay
7:07:09
connected even if your initial Outreach doesn't lead to an immediate project staying connected is key continue to
7:07:16
engage with their content Share value and nurture the relationship over time this consistent interaction can
7:07:23
eventually turn a cold Prospect into a warm lead and even into a loyal client
7:07:29
and here is an example that applies to both uh LinkedIn and Instagram you know you can say something simple like hi you
7:07:35
know their name I just wanted to check in and see what you are working on if there is anything I can help with uh
7:07:41
feel free to reach out so send follow-up messages periodically uh check in with
7:07:46
them and keep the conversation going you can start doing this manually and then automate the process over time and here
7:07:52
is a pro tip instead of sending uh you know text messages I mean through DM you
7:07:59
can send voice messages and voice messages are very powerful because they
7:08:04
feel very natural so as a conclusion cold Outreach on LinkedIn and Instagram doesn't have to feel intimidating okay
7:08:11
by approaching it as an opportunity to build genuine relationships rather than just making a sale you can effectively
7:08:17
turn cold prospects into warm leads remember if you try to fake this process it probably won't work and even if it
7:08:24
works sometimes it's not worth it okay authenticity is key consistently
7:08:30
reaching out to 100 people daily will increase your chances of success being kind and honest is not only a good
7:08:37
business practice but it also helps you build connections that are meaningful and mutually beneficial over time these
7:08:45
connections will grow and your efforts will lead to meaningful collaborations and long-term success in this section
7:08:51
we'll explore how to start incorporating automation into your Outreach strategy using LinkedIn sales Navigator along
7:08:57
with other automation tools this approach will help you manage tou scale while maintaining a level of
7:09:04
personalization that resonates with prospects once you've landed your first or second client through manual Outreach
7:09:11
it's time to consider scaling your efforts with automation manual Outreach is excellent
7:09:16
for establishing connections and gaining initial traction but automation allows you to reach a larger audience more
7:09:22
effectively and most importantly efficiently saving you time and enabling you to focus on delivering quality work
7:09:30
while most of the best automation tools are not free you can start with manual Outreach and once you uh begin making
7:09:37
money consider investing in PID tools to optimize your time or scale further and

messaging use custom variables like the person's name to personalize your Outreach and also leverage voice

7:15:25
convert cold leads into warm leads and how to transition from manual out reach
7:15:31
to automation crafting a compelling offer is essential for the success of your web
7:15:36
design business it's not just about listing your services all right it's about guiding your client on your
7:15:42
journey from their current situation which we call their current Island to their desire situation their desire
7:15:49
Island the Ocean between the two islands represent the challenges and uncertainties they face in making the
7:15:54
transition your offer is the boat that will take them across this ocean but to make this journey reassuring and secure
7:16:02
you must also include elements of risk reversal this lesson will explore how to effectively structure this offer to
7:16:08
ensure your clients feel confident and supported throughout the journey so what is a compelling offer a compelling offer
7:16:14
is a promise to take your clients from where they are now you know their current situation or current Island to
7:16:21
where they want to be their desire situation or desire Island to make this journey successful your offer must
7:16:27
clearly communicate three critical elements the pain of staying on the current Island the benefits of reaching
7:16:34
the desire Island and the safety measures or risk reversal that ensure the client can embark on the journey
7:16:40
with confidence to create a compelling offer you first need to understand your client's current situation like what's
7:16:46
keeping them stuck on the current Island this might be an outdate website low conversion rates or poor online
7:16:53
visibility equally important is to understand their desire situation you know the thriving business The Envision
7:16:59
after arriving at the desire Island where a modern High performing website drives growth and success the more
7:17:06
accurately you can Define this Gap the more effectively you can craft an offer that resonates with their needs now
7:17:13
let's talk about how to craft your unique value proposition your unique value proposition or uvp should clearly
7:17:20
communicate how your services will help clients move from the current situation to the desired situation for example if
7:17:26
a client actual situation is a slow un responsive website and they desire situation is a Sleek fast and mobile
7:17:33
friendly site that enhances user experience your uvp might be I help
7:17:38
businesses transform their outdated websites into high performing platforms that engage customers and drive sales
7:17:44
within 60 days the uvp must be clear okay so this uvp that I just said directly addresses the Gap and positions
7:17:51
your services as the essential solution to achieve their goals now let's talk about how to structure your offer and I
7:17:58
will explain this in three points number one one highlight the pain of staying on current Island clients often need to be
7:18:05
reminded of the discomfort they are currently experiencing to motivate them to take action for example staying in
7:18:11
the current Island where their website is outdated their online presence is weak and their business growth is
7:18:16
stagnant comes with significant pay points this might include lost Revenue a tarnished brand reputation and missed
7:18:23
opportunities in a competitive market by highlighting these issues and other issues as well you create a sense of
7:18:30
urgency encouraging them to take the journey to the desire Island number two
7:18:35
illustrate the benefits of reaching the desire Island once the pain of the current situation is clear you need to
7:18:40
paint a vivid picture of the benefits they will experience once they reach the desire Island this could mean something
7:18:47
like a modern responsive website that not only attracts more visitors but also converts them into loyal customers
7:18:54
leading to a sustained business growth and a strong online presence by illustrating these benefits you show the
7:19:00
client that your offer is not just a service okay it's a vital investment in their future success number three
7:19:07
provide a clear path to cross the ocean your offer should serve as the boat that safely carries your client across the
7:19:14
ocean between the current Island and the Desai Island however no journey across the sea is without risks which is why
7:19:22
your offer must include strong risk reversal strategies now let's talk about risk reversal and we'll talk about a
7:19:28
concept called the safety boat helic opter and submarine to reassure your client during the journey you should
7:19:35
offer multiple safety options the first one is the safety boat and this is the
7:19:40
first level of reassurance symbolizing a satisfaction guarantee or money back promise if the client feels unsure or if
7:19:48
the project doesn't meet their expectations they can step into the safety boat and return to the uh current
7:19:54
Island safely with no loss this basic safety net ensures that they won't be
7:19:59
worse off than when they started and um this is important because sometimes when uh people work with somebody new they
7:20:07
feel a lot of fear because they be like hey I don't want to be worse than where
7:20:12
I'm right now so I want to be in a position that is better or if the things don't work out at least I want to be in
7:20:19
my current situation and offering a money back guarantee often mitigates this the second is the helicopter for
7:20:26
clients who need even more Assurance you offer a helicopter okay representing a
7:20:32
premium guarantee if something goes wrong the helicopter can quickly take them back to safety symbolizing your
7:20:39
commitment to providing a full refund or additional compensation if the project
7:20:44
fails to meet their criteria this option gives clients an extra level of security
7:20:49
knowing that they can quickly and safely return to where they started if necessary for example if you are very
7:20:56
confident in your services you can offer the client a full refund Plus a monetary
7:21:01
compensation such as $200 $500 uh $11,000 or even more depending on the
7:21:07
project cost this high risk High reward strategy is extremely effective for building trust but should be only used
7:21:15
with a lot of caution meaning you should only implement this after achieving a high satisfaction rate with previous
7:21:22
clients to test this approach you can set aside a small manageable budget based on what you are comfortable losing
7:21:29
for example you might decide to allocate 5 to 10% of your earnings from recent
7:21:34
freelance projects or profits for this experiment I don't recommend using your life savings for this and I definitely
7:21:41
don't recommend using the money you Sav for taxes consider this as an investment in your business all right meaning that
7:21:47
you might not get that money back initially but it could lead to long-term benefits and if the strategy results in
7:21:55
more satisfied clients repeat business or referrals you can scale it further this is a controlled experiment okay and
7:22:02
if you see it work you can start expending the offer to more clients increasing the compensation amount or
7:22:07
incorporating it to your regular premium service package to attract more high value clients and if this experiment
7:22:14
doesn't work treat it as a learning experience and PIV it to another offer such as a full money back guarantee with
7:22:20
a free 1hour consultation for example because this way you shift to a less risky approach while refining your
7:22:26
promises and Service delivery to better suit your business and the third and last one is the submarine in cases where
7:22:33
the ocean is particularly rough you offer a submarine the submarine represents your ability to navigate even
7:22:40
the most challenging situations um unlike surface level safety measures the submarine can dive deep below the chaos
7:22:47
una affected by surface level storms such as Market changes or unexpected
7:22:52
project obstacles this flexibility symbolizes your adaptability and problem solving skills allowing you to adjust
7:22:59
your approach and sure the client reaches the desire Island safely or returns to the current Island if
7:23:05
necessary they should never feel worse off than when they started working with you the submarine provides reassurance
7:23:12
that no matter how rough the uh Journey becomes you have the tools to keep them safe and on course these multiple layers
7:23:19
of risk reversal uh show your clients that no matter what happens during the journey they are protected and supported
7:23:27
this comprehensive approach to risk reversal makes it easier for them to commit to the journey and here's an
7:23:33
example imagine you are a web designer working on a client's e-commerce site Midway through the project new
7:23:38
regulations require significant changes to the S payment system instead of being derailed you adapt by researching the
7:23:45
new rules and revising the design to comply with them you can reassure the client that the project will stay on
7:23:52
schedule by immediately implementing a compliant payment system ensuring the site can launch on time without losing
7:23:59
revenue and addition Al you can offer to refine and optimize the system post launch if needed demonstrating your
7:24:06
adaptability and problem solving skills this ensures that despite unexpected challenges the client remains confident
7:24:12
their project is on course for Success now that you've learned about the safety boat helicopter and submarine let's talk
7:24:18
about social proof and the social proof is represented by the happy passengers
7:24:24
navigation tools and experience crew before sailing your client needs to see that your boat is not only well equipped
7:24:30
but also Guided by a capable and experienced crew and that crew is you or your team an experienced crew who know

7:24:48

7:24:55

7:25:00
navigation tools your well planned project management systems processes and strategies demonstrate that you have the
7:25:07
right tools to keep the journey on course no matter what challenges arise when potential clients see your
7:25:13

7:29:54
of a contract number one the scope of work this section explains what services you will provide to the client it should
7:30:01
be as detailed as possible specifying the task you will perform the number of Provisions included and the

deliverables Clarity here prevents misunderstandings where the client expects additional work without extra

this Clause is very important because it prevents you from doing extra work without compensation number five
7:31:06
termination Clause this Clause explains how either party can end the contract before the work is completed it might
7:31:12
include a notice period like 30 days for example and any penalties or payments
7:31:18
that must be made if the contract is terminated early number six dispute
7:31:24
resolution this section describes what happens if there is a disagreement between you and the client it often
7:31:30
suggests methods like mediation or arbitration before going to court and the mediator is basically a third person
7:31:37
that helps you and the client uh you know talk through the problem and find the solution the mediator doesn't make
7:31:43
the uh you know any decisions but facilitates communication and the arbitrator is a
7:31:48
neutral third person as well that listens to both sides and makes a decision that both parties must follow
7:31:56
this is a faster and less expensive alternative to court and why it's important these methods help resolve
7:32:02
disputes quickly with less stress saving time and money number seven intellectual property rights this part of the
7:32:09
contract determines who owns the work once it's completed okay so typically
7:32:15
the rights to the work transferred to the client after full payment is received ensuring that you maintain
7:32:21
control over your work until you are paid number eight confidentiality claes
7:32:27
if the contract includes confiden it Clauses it means that you agree to keep
7:32:33
certain information private such as business Secrets data or Client List now
7:32:38
let's talk about ndas specifically and NDA which means non-disclosure agreement
7:32:44
is a type of contract that requires one or both parties to keep certain information confidential for example if
7:32:50
your client shares sensitive business information with you and NDA might require you to keep that information
7:32:57
private and not share it with others ndas are commonly used to protect Trade
7:33:02
Secrets business strategies and other confidential information in web design this could mean not sharing designs
7:33:10
funnels client data code or any other sensitive project details with third
7:33:15
parties either during the project or after the project now let's talk about
7:33:21
the key elements inside of an NDA and here are the key Clauses in ndas number
7:33:27
one nondisclosure obligations and and this Clause explains what information
7:33:32
you must keep confidential and to whom you are allowed to disclose this uh information such as subcontractors for
7:33:39
example for example if you are working on a large or complex project and need to hire other web designers graphic
7:33:46
designers or 3D designers to help you this Clause could specify that you are allowed to share confidential project
7:33:52
information with them however this would also require that these subcontractors sign an NDA or
7:34:00
be subject to the same confidentiality obligations this ensures that any
7:34:05
sensitive information about the project such as client details designs or business strategies remain protected
7:34:11
even when shared with others involved in the project number two duration of
7:34:16
confidentiality this specifies how long you must keep the uh information secret it could range from one year to several
7:34:24
years after the project ends number three scope of confidential information it's important that the section clearly
7:34:30
defines what is considered confidential to avoid overly broad restrictions that could limit your future work
7:34:36
opportunities and now let's talk about what to watch out for and this is extremely important so pay
7:34:43
attention because overlooking this could be very painful to you in the long run
7:34:49
so the first thing you have to watch out for is vague terms and here's an example when you see something like all business
7:34:55
related information shared during the course of this project must be keep confidential this is very vague and
7:35:01
leaves no room for interpretation all right does include emails General conversations or any specific documents
7:35:08
we don't know a clear example would be confidential information includes project design files client data
7:35:15
marketing strategies and any other non-public internal business information related to the project this is very
7:35:23
clear because these specific details clarify exactly what must be keep confidential leaving no room for doubt
7:35:31
another thing to watch out for is overly broad definitions avoid ndas that might
7:35:38
prevent you from working in your industry by defining um too much information as confidential and here is
7:35:45
a vague example you agree to keep confidential any and all information
7:35:51
including ideas processes and methods learn or develop during the course of
7:35:57
this project for an indefinite period of time and here's the problem with this
7:36:02
this definition is too broad because it includes General ideas techniques or methods that could or could not be
7:36:10
unique to this project it could also prevent you from using general skills or knowledge that you commonly appli in
7:36:17
your field or restrict you from working on similar projects in the future so be
7:36:22
very careful with this and here is a clear example you agree to keep confidential any propri AR project
7:36:30
details client specific data and non-public business information that is directly related to the client's
7:36:36
business and disclos during the project this is very specific and to the point
7:36:43
this version Narrows down the definition to cover only proprietary and non-public information ensuring that you are free
7:36:50
to use General Industry knowledge techniques and methods that are not specific to the client in future work
7:36:57
and that's amazing and the last key thing you have to watch out is fairness you have to make sure that the NDA only
7:37:04
covers information that genuinely needs to be protected and here is an unfair
7:37:10
example you agree to keep confidential all information related to the company
7:37:15
including publicly available information industry practices and third party
7:37:21
content and here's the problem with this this Clause is unfair because it requires you to keep information secret
7:37:28
that is already publicly available or widely known in the industry it could
7:37:34
also force you to protect information that doesn't generally need to be confidential creating unnecessary
7:37:40
restrictions and you don't want that and here is a fair example you agree to keep
7:37:45
confidential any non-public internal business details client specific data and proprietary project information
7:37:53
share during the course of this project this makes more sense all right
7:37:58
proprietary ref refers to the things that the business owns and or has
7:38:03
exclusive rights to this version limits the confidentiality to nonpublic internal and proprietary information
7:38:10
which generally needs protection it ensures that publicly available information or General Industry
7:38:15
practices are not necessarily restricted making the NDA fairer for both parties
7:38:22
so here are some common red flags in contracts and ndas when reviewing
7:38:27
contracts and ndas Beyond the look out for the following red flags number one unclear or ambiguous
7:38:34
language contract should be straightforward and easy to understand okay if any terms are vague or confusing
7:38:41
ask for clarification to the client or consult a lawyer number two unreasonable
7:38:47
Clauses be wary of Clauses that seem too strict or unfair for example a non-compete Clause might prevent you
7:38:54
from working with other clients in the same industry for an extended period of time with which could harm your business
7:39:00
and growth number three missing elements ensure the contract includes all the key components discussed earlier if
7:39:07
something is missing request its addition before signing here is what to
7:39:13
do before signing a contract or NDA okay number one this is the review process
7:39:18
first read carefully go through the entire document including the fine print take your time to understand everything
7:39:26
second ask questions okay if some something is unclear ask the client for
7:39:31
an explanation it's better to clarify now than to have problems later and
7:39:36
third consult a lawyer if the contract is complex or if you are unsure about
7:39:41
anything consider talking to a lawyer they can help you understand the document and protect your interest
7:39:49
number two negotiation do not hesitate to ask for changes if something in the contract doesn't work for you
7:39:55
negotiating terms is a normal part of business and most clients are open to discussing changes number three final
7:40:02
checklist before signing go through a checklist to ensure that everything is in order confirm that the scope of work
7:40:08
payment terms deadlines and all other critical elements are clearly defined to make it easier for you to understand and
7:40:15
work with contracts and ndas I've created simplified guides these guides are written in clear straightforward
7:40:22
language breaking down the complex legal terms you might encounter and this is how to use these
7:40:28
guides the these guides serve as a tool to help you interpret the more complicated language often found in
7:40:34
contracts and ndas you can print them or save them on your computer for easy
7:40:39
reference when you receive a contract or NDA refer to these guides to understand
7:40:45
what each section means they will help you ensure that you are not agreeing to something that could harm your freelance
7:40:51
web design business and you have to keep in mind that as a freelancer you might be responsible for drafting contracts
7:40:58
and ndas when working directly with clients especially smaller businesses or startups that may not have their um own
7:41:06
legal documents however some clients even smaller ones sometimes may prefer
7:41:11
to use their own agreements in either case it's important to clarify early on
7:41:16
who will provide the paperwork to ensure that you carefully review any client provided contracts to make sure they um
7:41:23
align with your terms and protect your interests these guides are incredibly
7:41:28
valuable because because they make legal documents easier to navigate giving you the confidence to handle contracts and
7:41:34

7:44:07
I'm the founder of the web designers Collective which is an International Community of web designers my current
7:44:14
mission is to create the most comprehensive and complete web design course in the world and share it with
7:44:19

7:44:25
of the modules and here are all the topics we'll cover basic accounting and financial
7:44:30
management setting rate and managing invoices and planning for taxes and savings let's begin in this lesson I
7:44:39
will guide you through the essential parts of managing your finances as a freelancer you will learn how to track
7:44:44
your earnings and expenses by understanding key financial statements like the profit and loss balance sheet
7:44:50
and cash flow statement I will break each one down in a simple way so you can stay in control of your business
7:44:55
finances and make smart decisions mastering these basics will help you stay organized and set yourself up for
7:45:01
long-term success financial statements are documents that help you understand how your freelance business is doing
7:45:07
financially even if you are not a financial expert learning about these statements will help you manage your
7:45:12
money better and avoid financial problems let's start by talking about the profit and loss statement or p&l the
7:45:20
p&l shows how much money you've made and how much money you spend over a specific period like a month quarter or year it's
7:45:28
like a report for your business that tells you if you are earning more money than you are spending usually at the top
7:45:34
of the p&l you will see the total earnings called Revenue below that you'll find the project cost subtracting
7:45:41
this cost from the revenue gives you the gross profit after that you will see the operating expenses such as software
7:45:47
tools and stuff like that when you subtract the operating expenses from the gross profit you get the operating
7:45:54
income which shows how much your business earn from its main activities after that you add any non-operating
7:46:01
income like royalties from selling a design template for example and then subtract tax deductions or other allowed
7:46:07
expenses and tax deductions are certain business related expenses that reduce the amount of income you have to pay
7:46:13
taxes on like office supplies travel or software cost and the amount you get
7:46:19
after subtracting tax deductions is your taxable income and then after paying
7:46:24
taxes on your taxable income the amount left is your net profit if the number is
7:46:29
positive your business made money if it's negative you spend more money than you earn if it's zero that means your
7:46:35
business is Break Even meaning the earnings exactly cover your expenses without profit or loss now let's talk
7:46:42
about the balance sheet the balance sheet gives you a snapshot of what your business owns called assets and what it
7:46:49
owes called liabilities at a particular Moment In Time think of it like a photo
7:46:54
of your business financial situation okay on one side it shows what you have
7:46:59
like money in the bank or equipment you can use for work on the other side it shows what you owe like loans bills or
7:47:06
payments you need to make the goal is for your assets to be more than your
7:47:11
liabilities meaning you own more than you owe this statement helps you
7:47:17
understand the value of your business and whether if you are financially stable or not and finally the cash flow
7:47:22
statement the cash flow statement shows how much money moves in and out of your business it's like a tracker for the
7:47:28
flow of cash you know cash in and cash out it's important because even if you
7:47:34
have profits you might run into trouble if your money isn't coming in when you
7:47:39
need to pay your bills all right and this statement is very very important because it helps you see when you will
7:47:45
have enough cash to cover your expenses or if you need to adjust your spending I
7:47:50
prepare this spreadsheet which contains the main financial statement tailored for freelance web designers and this is
7:47:57
the profit and loss statement we have the balance sheet here the monthly cash
7:48:02
flow the revenue and then the monthly expenses from January to December all
7:48:10
right and these tabs right here the balance sheet revenue and all the monthly expenses from January to
7:48:17
December are connected to this other tab the profit and loss statement and that
7:48:23
means that when we input data in those tabs it appears here okay this
7:48:28
spreadsheet contains a bunch of formulas that I crafted with a lot of love and
7:48:34
dedication let me show you an example let's say a client paid us $10,000 for a project so we would go here in the
7:48:41
revenue Tab and then right here we would add
7:48:46
$10,000 right here and then we go back to the profit and loss Tab and then
7:48:53
we'll see it right here and then we will see it here in the
7:48:58
balance sheet sheet right here and also in the cash flow tab right
7:49:06
here so this is automatic in this spreadsheet whenever you see a note like this one means that
7:49:14
all these numbers are added automatically okay so you don't have to enter anything manually right here and
7:49:21
it's the same thing here okay and then here as well
7:49:29
all right and then when you see this note in yellow it means that you should
7:49:35
add the data manually let me give you another example let's say in January we go to a business event so we would go
7:49:42
here it says January then we will go right here and
7:49:49
then we will add the expense let's say is $2,000 and then as we can see right here
7:49:56
it will populate automatically all right now let's quickly explore the balance
7:50:02
sheet and the balance sheet is like extremely important and that's why you have to study it and get the hang of it
7:50:08
if you do you will probably sleep easier at night because you will know exactly how your business is performing and I
7:50:15
want to emphasize this because a lot of Freelancers make a lot of money a lot of uh Revenue they have a bunch of clients
7:50:22
and stuff like that but they don't understand the difference between assets and liabilities they don't understand
7:50:28
what the net worth is and all that stuff okay and then they wonder why am I broke
7:50:33
if I'm making all this revenue and that's because they don't know their numbers for example if you make $10,000
7:50:40
in revenue and you have $22,000 in expenses don't go and withdraw everything okay you would have uh $8,000
7:50:47
in net income so if you withdraw all of it all right you won't
7:50:55
have Capital to reinvest in the business and that bad okay however if you withdraw only for
7:51:03
example $3,000 all right you would have some money to
7:51:09
reinvest and this is just an example all right it doesn't mean that every time you uh make $110,000 you withdraw 3,000
7:51:17
all right this is just an example and we have to factor in taxes as well and here
7:51:22
we can see that taxes are zero because we haven't uh we did not add the tax rate
7:51:29
right here okay but if we add the tax rate let's say 35% and we go back to the balance sheet
7:51:37
now we can see our taxes don't be intimidated by all these
7:51:43
terms okay when you scroll down right here you will find the description of each one so you can better understand
7:51:54
them so play with the numbers in these tabs and get a hang of it you can also
7:51:59
make a copy of this spreadsheet and save it to your Google Drive by going right
7:52:04
here and then clicking here to access this spreadsheet and all resources you
7:52:10
have to be a member of our web design community and you can join for free by going to webdesigners collective.com
7:52:17
once you join our community you can stop here and then hang out and talk with other designers there are some amazing
7:52:24
conversations happening here and then to access the spreadsheet you just have to click here where it says
7:52:31
classroom and then here where it says exclusive guides and documents and then
7:52:36
right here in the left column you will see this section called spreadsheets then when you click here where it says
7:52:42
freelancer financial statements you will see this okay and then you click access
7:52:47
the spreadsheet and you will access the spreadsheet directly if you have any questions about
7:52:53
the spreadsheet let me know in the comments or make a post in the community under extending these financial
7:52:59
statements will help you run your freelance business more smoothly and plan for your future they give you the
7:53:05
tools to make smart decisions about saving spending and growing your business all right so now I hope you
7:53:11
have a clear understanding about the main of financial statements okay now let's talk about budgeting and financial
7:53:18
planning for web design projects and pay special attention because I don't care how skilled you are as a web designer if
7:53:25
you don't get this right your business will be in shamal all right so pay attention let's talk about resource
7:53:32
allocation when you start a new web design project it's very important to allocate your resources wisely start by
7:53:38
listing everything you need okay your time tools and any outside help you
7:53:43
might need you can just use pen and paper all right for this phase for example do you need a specific premium
7:53:50
Plugin or software for a specific feature will you Outsource the development or handle it yourself next
7:53:57
estimate the cost cost and time for each resource to do this practically break down the project into specific phases
7:54:04
like design development revisions and final delivery and then assign hours or
7:54:09
days to each phase and always include a 10 to 15% buffer for unexpected
7:54:15
situations like client revisions or technical issues okay you can use tools
7:54:20
like Trello or Asana to visualize these spes making it easy to adjust resources
7:54:25
as needed okay allocating resources properly helps you avoid delays and also
7:54:30
ensures you stay within budget if you are looking for a better way to plan and execute your web design
7:54:37
projects inside our free community at webdesigners collective.com you will find a free comprehensive tutorial on
7:54:43
using Trello to keep track of your projects I have personally experienced
7:54:49
the challenges of not managing timelines properly and trust me it can lead to unnecessary complications so don't make
7:54:56
the same mistake okay join our community for free and access this guide plus many
7:55:01
other resources designed to elevate your web design project management and delivery okay timeline
7:55:08
estimations creating a reliable timeline is one of the most important steps in project management the first thing you
7:55:14
have to do is start by dividing the project into smaller manageable tasks for instance if you are designing a
7:55:20
homepage you can break it down into wi framing uh initial design and client revisions and then estimate how long
7:55:27
each part will take for example if you think wireframing takes a day maybe plan
7:55:32
for a day and a half or two days to leave some Breathing Room a practical tip is to use a project management tool
7:55:38
like notion for example but in module 8 I will show you how to create an amazing
7:55:43
digital workstation with a free but powerful open- Source tool where you can organize and manage your projects when
7:55:51
you finish organizing the project and figure out the uh timeline share it with your client in advance making sure they
7:55:57
know when to expect updates and the final delivery this is very important okay that way if any delays happen
7:56:05
you've already set expectations and the clients will appreciate this uh clear communication here is a pro tip when you
7:56:11
send updates ask for prompt feedback to avoid bottlenecks and here is an example
7:56:18
this encourages timely feedback while maintaining a polite and professional tone keeping the project moving forward
7:56:25
smoothly okay now it's time to talk about emergency funds every freelancer should have an emergency fund and
7:56:31
building this fund can be very simple if you start small Begin by Saving 10% of
7:56:36
your earnings from each project and I recommend using a separate bank account specifically for this purpose so you are
7:56:43
not tempted to spend it and as you complete more projects aim to grow this fund until it covers at least 3 to six
7:56:50
months of your living and business expenses and this ensures that even if your computer breaks for example or a
7:56:57
client delays payment or work slows down uh unexpectedly you won't be financially
7:57:03
stressed I highly recommend using wise a bank account for getting paid I've personally used it for years without any
7:57:10
major issues it allows you to create multiple accounts in different currencies and set up digital jars to
7:57:15
save money and prevent accidental spending and please note I'm not
7:57:21
affiliated with wi and I don't receive any compensation for mentioning them this is simply my honest advice okay
7:57:28
okay so remember a safety net gives you peace of mind and also keeps your business running smoothly in any
7:57:33
situation in this lesson you've learned about understanding financial statements as well as budgeting and financial
7:57:39
planning for web design projects let's move to the next lesson in this lesson we will dive deep into one of the most
7:57:45
critical aspects of running a successful web design business which is how to set your rates confidently and manage your
7:57:51
invoices like a pro whether you are just starting out or looking to refine your pricing strategy getting this right is
7:57:57
essential for long-term success we will cover everything okay from choosing between hourly and project base rates to
7:58:04
understanding the psychology behind pricing and how to handle invoices effectively so you can uh keep your cash
7:58:10
flow steady by the end of this lesson you will feel more empowered to charge what you are worth and also have a
7:58:17
streamlined system for getting paid on time now I will guide you through the different pricing models you can use as
7:58:23
a freelance web designer the model you choose depends on the type of work you are doing and the preferences of your
7:58:29
clients the first model is hourly rate and charging by the hour is very straightforward especially when the
7:58:35
project scope is flexible you can calculate your hourly rate by determining how much you need to make
7:58:40
each month to cover your expenses and keep a desire profit for example if your
7:58:46
monthly goal is $5,000 and you plan to work 100 billable hours your hourly rate
7:58:52
would be $50 this method ensures that your pricing is aligned with your financial needs and workload
7:58:59
the second model is day rate which is when clients pay for a full day of your time and this is great for short
7:59:06
projects or consultations for example if your hourly rate is $50 a typical day rate would be
7:59:12
$400 for an 8 hour day the third model is Project based pricing for
7:59:18
well-defined projects charging a fixed price makes sense both you and the client agree on a total cost for the
7:59:26
entire project ensuring that every everyone knows the scope and budget to
7:59:31
set this price multiply your estimated hours by your hourly rate then add a buffer for any revisions or additional
7:59:38
tasks for example if you estimate 120 hours at a $50 per hour rate you could
7:59:44
charge $6,000 for the entire project and then you can add an extra 10 or 15% sa
7:59:50
buffer for additional tasks you could also use a hybrid model which is your fixed rate for example in this case
7:59:56
$6,000 set scope and then $50 per hour for anything
8:00:02
extra and then the fourth model is a fixed monthly retainer a fixed monthly price gives
8:00:08
clients ongoing access to your services while ensuring predictable income for you instead of charging by the hour set
8:00:15
a flat fee that covers the work you will provide for each month for example a client might pay $2,000 per month for
8:00:22
ongoing design updates support and other services and this is a model that lawyers and accountants use a lot in
8:00:29
order to offer ongoing services so this approach works well for clients who need
8:00:34
regular work and prefer a consistent monthly cost over fluctuating hourly fees so now let's talk more in detail
8:00:42
about how to calculate your rate setting your rate is key to ensuring you are paid fairly and meet your financial
8:00:49
goals here is how you can calculate number one start with your initial
8:00:54
monthly goal calculate how much you need each month to cover your your living expenses business cost and the desire
8:01:00
savings for example if your expenses are $4,000 and you want to save $1,000 your
8:01:07
monthly goal would be $5,000 simple right number two estimate your billable
8:01:13
hours not all your time will be avilable so figure out how many hours you can actually charge clients okay it's not 24
8:01:20
hours per day right let's say you can realistically build 100 hours per month
8:01:25
for example okay so that would be about 24 hours per week and then number three
8:01:31
calculate your rate and you can do that by dividing your monthly goal by your billable hours so if your goal is $5,000
8:01:39
and you can work 100 billable hours your rate would be $50 per hour managing
8:01:45
invoices efficiently is key to getting paid on time and keeping your cash flow healthy this Simple Guide will help you
8:01:51
navigate through um you know the invoicing process especially if you are just starting out first make sure your
8:01:57
invoices are clear and detail okay include your business name contact information a detailed description of
8:02:04
the services provided um the agreed price and the total amount due don't forget to add payment terms
8:02:11
like dueing 14 days this helps avoid confusion and make sure clients know exactly what they are paying for and
8:02:18
when when you are just getting started there is no need for complicated software okay you can start with a
8:02:24
simple invoice template which you will find in the exclusive guides and document section in the community's
8:02:30
classroom if you are not a member of our community yet you can join for free at webdesigners collective.com and then you
8:02:36
will have access to all these documents and stuff this will help you create professional invoices quickly and easily
8:02:42
as your freelance web design business grows consider using invoicing software like freshbooks wave or QuickBooks I
8:02:49
recommend using QuickBooks because it's the one I'm most familiar with and I don't have any affiliations with them so
8:02:55
it's just my honest advice these tools make it easy to create professional invoices track payments and send
8:03:00
automatic reminders for overdue payments they will also help you stay organized and save time especially when working
8:03:06
with multiple clients it's very important to send invoices promptly so getting the habit of sending an invoice
8:03:12
as soon as the project is completed or after you've reach a uh you know an agreed Milestone and the faster you send
8:03:20
it the faster you will get paid and also make it easy for clients to pay okay by
8:03:25
offering multiple payment options you could accept Bank transfers or credit card payments through services like
8:03:32
stripe the more ways uh clients can pay the Fe delays you will encounter
8:03:37
sometimes clients pay late and that sucks but if a payment is overdue stay calm and reach out to them it's
8:03:44
perfectly normal to follow up professionally you can send a polite reminder via email or use invoicing
8:03:51
software to automate the process you could also just give them a call okay
8:03:56
just say something like this how hi I hope you are doing well just a quick reminder that the invoice from uh you
8:04:02
know the date is due soon let me know if you need any further information thanks
8:04:08
you know just a subtle nudge and avoid bringing up your personal expenses or pressures in this first message okay
8:04:15
stay firm but polite never rude never desperate stay elegant at all times and
8:04:21
obviously this is difficult because there are real pressures okay however standing your ground will help you build
8:04:27
your cap don't forget to include taxes on your invoices as well if required follow the
8:04:32
tax laws in your country to ensure you are compliant as staying on top of your taxes helps you avoid legal issues later

8:05:08
while keeping your cash flow healthy allowing you to focus on what matters the most growing your web design
8:05:14
business in this lesson you learn about understanding pricing models calculating your rate and creating and managing
8:05:20
invoices now it's time to move to the next lesson as a freelance web designer your financial health is directly tied
8:05:27
to how well you plan for your future unlike traditional employees you are responsible for managing your taxes
8:05:33
planning for savings and ensuring you have enough to cover emergencies and retirement and this might seem
8:05:39
overwhelming at first but once you understand the key principles you'll be able to manage your finances with
8:05:45
confidence in this lesson I will guide you through everything you need to know about taxes deductions record keeping
8:05:51
and savings the goal here is to help you build a financial Foundation that supports your freelance Journey whether
8:05:57
you are starting out or looking to scale your business understanding your tax obligations as a freelance web designer
8:06:03
can feel overwhelming especially since tax systems and rules vary greatly across different countries however there
8:06:10
are a few general principles that can help you stay on track no matter where are you located first it's important to
8:06:17
recognize that Freelancers are responsible for managing and paying their own taxes unlike traditional
8:06:22
employees you won't have an employer handling this for you depending on your country this usually includes income tax
8:06:29
and in many cases uh social contributions or self-employment taxes staying informed about your local tax
8:06:35
requirements is crucial so make it a habit to check Government website or consult with a tax professional who
8:06:42
understands the regulations in your region another key point is to pay close attention to tax deadlines many
8:06:48
countries require Freelancers to make regular tax payments either monthly quarterly or annually missing these
8:06:55
deadlines can lead to penalties so it's important to know when payments are due in your area keeping a calendar with
8:07:01
important tax dates and setting reminders can help you avoid the stress of last minute payments additionally
8:07:07
using accounting software to automate these processes can save you time and reduce the risk of error proper record
8:07:13
keeping is also essential okay as a freelancer you need to track all your income and expenses to accurately report
8:07:18
your earnings and claim deductions where applicable these deductions can significantly lower your taxable income
8:07:25
so it's important to know which expenses qualify as business related as mentioned earlier using accounting software or
8:07:32
apps to maintain organized records will make tax time much more easier and help you monitor your overall Financial
8:07:38
Health lastly Consulting with a tax professional can be very valuable tax loss can be very complex okay and it
8:07:45
change over time so getting advice from someone familiar with your country's regulations can save you from costly
8:07:51
mistakes especially when you are scaling your business this is especially important if you work with with
8:07:57
International clients or have multiple sources of income do not hesitate to invest in professional help when you
8:08:03
start making money by following these guidelines you can confidently navigate your tax obligations and keep your
8:08:08
freelance web design business running smoothly here is a pro tip as a general rule of thumb save 20 to 30% of your
8:08:16
income for taxes depending on your country's tax rates however if you live in a high tax region or have higher
8:08:23
earnings consider saving 35 to 40% to cover additional liabilities like bat
8:08:29
state taxes or Social Security contributions for those in a low or zero
8:08:35
tax regions like the United Arab Emirates or Andora you may not need to save as much for taxes but it's still
8:08:41
wise to stay informed on any local fees or regulations and don't forget that deductible expenses such as home office
8:08:49
cost or business travel can reduce your taxable income helping you save more you
8:08:54
can also explore legal strategies to reduce taxes such as maximizing retirement contributions taking
8:09:00
advantage of tax credits or using offshore accounts in compliance with the tax laws finally consult a tax
8:09:06
professional to get personalized advice based on your location and income this way you will always be prepared when
8:09:12
payments are due and can take full advantage of any tax saving opportunities available for you as I
8:09:18
mentioned earlier tax deductions and credits can significantly reduce the amount of taxes you owe and
8:09:25
understanding how they work can help you maximize your savings while the specifics of what can be deducted vary
8:09:31
based on your country's tax loss the general principle is the same okay you
8:09:36
can lower your taxable income by deducting business related expenses
8:09:41
deductions allow you to subtract certain cost directly related to your business from your taxable income as a freelancer
8:09:48
you can usually deduct expenses like business equipment you know laptops monitors or office tools and also home
8:09:55
office expenses you know like a portion of your rent electricity or internet cost if you work from home and other
8:10:01
things as well like work related travel for example uh flights hotels and transportation and software
8:10:07
subscriptions such as design tools or project management apps these deductions can significantly lower the amount of
8:10:14
income on which you will be taxed providing much needed relief during tax season on the other hand tax credits
8:10:20
work differently by directly reducing the amount of tax you owe rather than reducing your taxable income okay okay
8:10:27
so it's different depending on your location common tax credits include those for uh retirement contributions
8:10:34
such as a 401k in the United States eco-friendly home office improvements or
8:10:39
educational expenses here is a pro tip it's crucial to stay organized by keeping receipts of invoices for all
8:10:46
deductible expenses throughout the year you don't need to invest in expensive software early on okay free tools like
8:10:53
Google drive or Dropbox are sufficient for storing digital copies of your receipts simply scan or take a photo of your
8:10:59
receipts and organize them into folders by category and date this way when tax season arrives you'll have everything
8:11:05
ready to file your taxes smoothly and avoid any issues if you are audited and remember to always consult a tax
8:11:12
professional to ensure you are compliant with tax laws specific to your region so you can make the most of available tax
8:11:18
saving opportunities now let's talk about keeping records keeping accurate records is essential for managing your
8:11:25
taxes budgeting and overall Finance Health as a freelance web designer the first thing to track is income which
8:11:31
includes all payments from clients or other freelance work using a dedicated bank account for your business is highly
8:11:38
recommended okay as it allows you to easily separate personal and business finances making tracking simpler and
8:11:44
more efficient so I recommend setting up both a business and personal wise account with wise you can open a
8:11:50
personal account along with your business account so basically both accounts will live under the same roof
8:11:55
but they will be separated so it's very convenient I will leave a link in the description so you can open an account
8:12:01
it's free all right also efficiently managing your receipts and invoices is just a
8:12:07
scross tools like Dex can automatically scan and store receipts seamlessly
8:12:12
integrating with QuickBooks for smooth organization always categorize documents by date and type for easy access to stay
8:12:18
on top of your finances review your bank statements regularly and ensure all business transactions are accurately
8:12:24
categorized in your accounting software or Financial records setting a weekly or monthly review schedule helps keep
8:12:31
everything organized and ensures no transactions are missed reducing stress during tax season and here is a pro tip
8:12:38
retain business records for at least 5 years or longer depending on your country's tax loss okay to safeguard
8:12:44
your business against potential Audits and disputes to end this moduel let's talk about planning for savings as a
8:12:52
freelance web designer your income May fluctuate okay making it essential to plan for your savings carefully to
8:12:57
ensure long-term Financial stability because what often happens is that people uh get paid all right and
8:13:04
they spend most of the money and that's a mistake because sometimes there are fluctuations and it's smart to save some
8:13:11
of it okay this fund should cover 3 to six months worth of living expenses such
8:13:17
as rent food and any unexpected bills during slow periods for example if your
8:13:22
monthly expenses are $2,000 aim to save at least 6K as a Financial safety net
8:13:28
and obviously when you are just getting started your savings might be $0 and that's okay just keep saving steadily
8:13:34
until you build up that emergency fund the key is to stay consistent even if you start small because each
8:13:41
contribution will bring you closer to your goal and remember to keep this Fund in an easily accessible savings account
8:13:48
or wise digital jar because that ensures you have quick access when needed giving
8:13:53
you peace of mind during un certain times while Freelancers don't have employer sponsor retirement plans it's
8:13:59
essential to try to take charge of your future Financial Health by setting aside money for
8:14:05
retirement you have learned already about the importance of consistency in savings and this applies just as much to
8:14:12
your retirement funds many countries offer tax advantages for contributions to retirement accounts such as IRAs
8:14:20
personal pensions or similar plans be sure to check with your local financial institutions to explore the best options
8:14:26
available in Europe region and keep in mind that even if you are starting small building the habit of regular
8:14:32
contributions can make a significant impact over time and investing in Diversified portfolios or index funds
8:14:38
through platforms that offer retirement accounts allows your money to grow steadily providing long-term growth
8:14:43
potential once you have built a stable Financial base you could consider investing in startups as a highrisk high
8:14:50
reward strategy these Investments can bring you substantial returns if the startup succeeds however is crucial to
8:14:57
carefully research each opportunity and understand the risks Consulting a financial adviser who specializes in

success all right congratulations on completing mag 6 in the next module you will dive into the exciting world of AI
8:16:08
and learn how to use it to become a super designer thank you very much for watching and I will see you in the next
8:16:15
module hey what's up in this video we'll talk about something big how to leverage AI to become a super designer and as
8:16:22
many of you know I've been designing since 2004 and I've seen so many in our field I remember back in 2008 when
8:16:30
WordPress first started to become popular that everybody was talking about how web designers were finished and that
8:16:37
did not happen right and obviously many designers gave up because they saw how competitive the field was starting to
8:16:43
become and those who stayed in the market and evolved saw many new
8:16:49
opportunities and that's what's happening right now it's like a technological shift but AI won't replace
8:16:54
you if you learn how to use it in your face there is a lot of money to be made in this new era AI is just a powerful tool
8:17:01
let's learn how to use it here are the main topics we'll cover introduction to
8:17:06
AI in general introduction to AI in design exploring prompt
8:17:12
engineering understanding AI agents and the future of AI for web designers let's
8:17:18
begin artificial intelligence AK AI always sounded like something from science fiction right but it's already
8:17:26
part of our daily lives especially in the world of design in this lesson you will learn what artificial intelligence
8:17:31
really is how it's evolved over the years and why it's now an essential tool for modern designers by understanding
8:17:38
the basics of AI you will be able to see how it can elevate your work and help you do things faster and more
8:17:43
efficiently we also explore the key figures who have shaped the AI field giving you a better appreciation for the
8:17:51
technology so what's AI exactly AI refers to machines and software that are
8:17:56
designed to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence these tasks
8:18:02
include understanding language solving problems learning from data and even recognizing images or making decisions
8:18:09
the key idea behind the eye is to create systems that can perform these tasks without needing constant human input AI
8:18:17
can be broken into two main types narrow Ai and general AI also known as AGI
8:18:23
narrow AI which is the type we use today is designed to perform a specific task
8:18:29
for example AI that powers Voice assistance like Siri or Alexa or the AI apps that help improve your designs in
8:18:36
tools like figma or web flow all fall under this category on the other hand General AI refers to a technology that
8:18:43
could learn and perform almost any intellectual task that a human can and
8:18:48
that's extremely powerful for good and for bad so I believe that us as humans
8:18:54
should take responsibility and make sure that um you know AI is under control
8:19:00
this type of AI is still in development at the time of recording this video but it's what people often imagine when they
8:19:06
think about a futuristic you know AI that can think and learn on its own now let's briefly talk about the history of
8:19:13
AI and its key figures the idea of AI is not new okay it dates back to the 1950s
8:19:20
when Len toring a brilliant British mathematician posed a question can
8:19:25
machines think this led to the creation of the toring test which aimed to determine whether a
8:19:31
machine could imitate human intelligence well enough to be in distinguishable from a human however even before toring
8:19:38
some groundbreaking work researchers like Warren mullock and wter pets were laying the groundwork for the
8:19:44
development of neural networks a fundamental component of modern AI
8:19:50
another important figure is Dr John McCarthy who coined the term artificial intelligence in 1956 he and other
8:19:57
scientists at the time laid the foundation for the development of AI fast forward to the modern era you have
8:20:03
individuals like Jeffrey Hinton often called The Godfather of deep learning who played a major role in developing
8:20:10
neural networks which are the core of today's AI systems understanding these
8:20:15
main figures and their contributions helps us appreciate the powerful AI tools we have today having explored the
8:20:22
early Pioneers let's now turn our attention to the key figures currently shaping the world of of AI the current
8:20:28
AI landscape is shaped by key innovators who are not only pushing the boundaries
8:20:33
of what AI can achieve but also influencing how designers and developers build digital products including
8:20:40
websites and applications by understanding the contributions of these people you will
8:20:45
see how their work impacts web design user experience and AI driven creativity
8:20:51
let's start with Sam Alman the CEO of open AI he has been instrumental in
8:20:56
devel GPT models like chat GPT which are transforming content creation idea
8:21:01
generation and even coding assistance for designers who want to dive into the coding world for instance you can use
8:21:07
chpt to quickly generate product descriptions streamline copyrighting for landing pages or gather some feedback on
8:21:14
design Trends the natural language processing capabilities of GPT models are also being integrated into web
8:21:20
platforms by developers to improve chatbot interfaces allowing designers to collaborate in creating more inter
8:21:26
active and personalized user experiences Demis hassab is the CEO of Deep Mind
8:21:31
which is an AI company acquired by Google back in 2014 is known for developing Alpha go an AI that mastered
8:21:38
the complex Chinese board game go where players strategically place stones to control territory he also created Alpha
8:21:45
fult which accurately predicts protein structure solving major biological challenges although these breakthroughs
8:21:51
focus on games and biology they highlight ai's potential in many fields Elon Musk best known for his work with
8:21:58
Tesla and SpaceX also co-founded open Ai and has been a strong advocate for AI
8:22:04
safety and while he no longer holds direct role at open AI at the time of this recording his ongoing efforts with
8:22:11
neuralink a company focus on integrating AI with human cognition could have profound implications for the future of
8:22:18
design though still in his early stages neural Link's brain computer interface technology may push designers to rethink
8:22:24
how they create websites and this products considering new forms of human computer interaction musk's emphasis on
8:22:31
human AI collaboration encourages designers to look Beyond traditional web design exploring how um future digital
8:22:38
experiences might be shaped by brain machine interfaces and direct user AI
8:22:44
interaction elan's recent work with gr and AI tagbot developed by XII reflects
8:22:50
his focus on the potential of AI to enhance human capabilities gr is designed to provide real time
8:22:56
information interact conversationally and assist users by pulling data from the X platform and Beyond as well Andrew
8:23:05
Ang founder of deep learning Ai and former head of Google brain has focused on making AI education accessible and
8:23:11
promoting the practical application of AI in everyday tasks his work in AI
8:23:17
driven data analysis and machine learning can offer valuable insights for web designers there are other key
8:23:23
figures in the AI Innovation Field worth mentioning yeah leun Sebastian thrun Ian
8:23:28
Goodfellow DNE Coler and of course Dr F Fe Lee in this lesson you learn what AI
8:23:36
is explored a brief overview of ai's history and also discovered the key
8:23:41
figures in the current AI landscape AI is transforming the design world at a
8:23:46
rapid Pace but many designers still don't realize the full potential of these tools or are confused on what to
8:23:53
use and what not to use in this lesson we'll dive into how AI is already been used in design from enhancing creativity
8:24:00
to automating tedos tasks many of the tools you use today are enhanced by AI
8:24:05
which is fundamentally transforming how designers work by automating tasks improving workflows and offering
8:24:11
Creative Solutions for example in figma there are AI power plugins that automatically perform different tasks
8:24:17
this allows you to focus on the bigger picture of user experience rather than spending time on repetitive tasks
8:24:24
similarly all tools use AI to edit images which can be incredibly useful for designers who need to quickly edit
8:24:30
visuals without diving into a complex software like Photoshop framer is another tool that
8:24:37
integrates AI into its workflow while framer itself isn't an AI tool it supports AI power Integrations that help
8:24:44
designers automate parts of the design process for example AI can be used to suggest improvements to your prototypes
8:24:50
or optimize layouts based on feedback or behavioral data this helps you refine your designs fast
8:24:56
ensuring they align with user needs and preferences this video is just an introduction to AI but I will be
8:25:03
uploading more in depth videos on my YouTube channel where I will dive into how specifically use these AI Tools in
8:25:10
detail so make sure to subscribe so you don't miss any updates in webflow AI is
8:25:16
used to automate parts of the development process webflow now integrates ai directly into each
8:25:21
platform offering features like personalized content optimization and AI driven suggestions also supports
8:25:28
Integrations with many AI power apps to further enhance workflows there are also
8:25:33
emerging AI driven platforms that claim to design complete and functional websites with just one single prompt
8:25:39
while these tools sound promising the reality is that at the time of this recording the solutions are extremely
8:25:45
limited they may work for small businesses or organizations that cannot afford to hire a professional designer
8:25:51
or a professional design team but these AI generated websites often require significant fine-tuning it's almost like
8:25:58
a paradoxical because while AI is supposed to make our work easier some AI tools can actually add complexity to the
8:26:06
design process by producing results that need extensive manual refinement to meet
8:26:11
Professional Standards for now ai is very useful in assisting in gening ideas like color palets layouts or graphics
8:26:18
and provide inspiration during the creative process however if you are aiming to work with high ticket clients
8:26:24
those who seek tailored high-end designs you must go beyond AI generated templates and suggestions these clients
8:26:30
value customization originality and the Strategic thought that only a human designer can provide at this moment in
8:26:36
time this is where understanding and applying design thinking becomes crucial design thinking involves empathizing
8:26:41
with users defining problems ideating solutions prototyping and testing it's like a human Center approach to solving
8:26:48
design challenges that goes far beyond what AI can offer High ticket clients expect designers who cannot only execute
8:26:55
a design but also understand the business goals user behaviors and also Market context behind the project they
8:27:03
they need someone who can think strategically solve complex problems and create a design that truly resonates
8:27:08
with their brand and audience while AI is a fantastic tool to streamline certain task and boost creativity your
8:27:15
um unique ability to empathize and innovate and provide meaningful design Solutions is what sets you apart in the
8:27:21
market as I said one of the most exciting ways AI is helping designers is by boosting creativity for example as
8:27:28
you probably know by now chpt is a powerful tool for brainstorming ideas whether you are stuck on a project or
8:27:35
need fresh inspiration you can use AI to generate new ideas or research trends
8:27:40
that are relevant to your work in addition to brainstorming tools like CLA offer a safer more ethically focused AI
8:27:47
environment for Creative ideation and remember that AI isn't replacing creativity it's enhancing it and I want
8:27:55
to emphasize this because it's very important as a designer you still bring the Creative Vision but AI can help you
8:28:01
reach that Vision Faster by automating TDS tasks or suggesting new directions for your work I created a document with
8:28:08
a bunch of different AI tools and I will be updating this list okay you can find the link in the description in this
8:28:14
lesson you learn how AI is transforming the web design industry and how it's boosting creativity in this lesson we
8:28:21
will explore plant engineering a crucial skill for web designers who want to harness the full power of AI prompt
8:28:27
engineering is basically all about crafting the right questions or instructions to get accurate and useful
8:28:33
results from AI tools whether you are conducting user research or improving user experience knowing how to frame
8:28:39
your prompts can make your AI power tools much more effective by the end of this lesson you will understand how to
8:28:45
create specific actionable prompts that will enhance your ux research and decision- making processes mastering
8:28:52
promp engineering is like having a powerful extension of your brain that that enhances your creative and problem
8:28:57
solving abilities so what is promp engineering exactly promp engineering is the process of Designing clear detailed
8:29:04
instructions or questions for AI models like chat GPT CLA gemini or other
8:29:09
research tools the way you phrase your input can have a big impact on the quality of the output you receive when
8:29:16
it comes to ux and research PRM engineering helps you extract meaningful insights generate user personas or even
8:29:23
analyze survey results in a more structured and efficient way for example instead of simply asking what do users
8:29:29
want in a product you could refine The Prompt by saying analyze the top five pain points for users in the e-commerce
8:29:36
space focusing on issues related to checkout experiences and product Discovery so you have to be more
8:29:42
specific and this way you will get responses that are much more actionable now let's explore and try to understand
8:29:49
why uh promp engineering is important for ux and research in ux and research data and
8:29:56
user insights are key to creating successful designs and experiences however Gathering analyzing
8:30:03
and interpreting these data can be time consuming that's where AI comes in with the right prompts AI can help you sort
8:30:09
through user feedback analyze large data sets and even generate research reports
8:30:14
based on your instructions prompt engineering ensures that you ask AI the right questions in a way that produces
8:30:20
useful answers this is especially important when conducting user research or designing user flows because the more
8:30:27
specific your questions are the more targeted the Ari responses will be now let's talk about how to write effective
8:30:33
prompts for ux and research when crafting prompts for ux and research
8:30:39
follow these key principles to get the most relevant and actionable insights first provide context make sure the AI
8:30:46
understands the background and scope of your research this includes specifying key details like the platform you are
8:30:53
analyzing the type of users involved the the time frame and the specific behavior
8:30:58
or data you want insights on the more precise and relevant the context the more accurate and actionable the ai's
8:31:04
responses will be helping you focus on the specific outcomes you need from your research second ask for specifics when
8:31:11
analyzing user feedback or behaviors be clear about the specific insights you want and here's an example what are the
8:31:18
top three challenges users face when navigating an online booking platform third use iterations start with a broad
8:31:25
prompt and then refine it as you analyze the ai's responses and you do this by
8:31:30
asking follow-up questions to dig deeper into key points this refinement helps you get more detailed actionable
8:31:37
insights from the AI and then improves the quality of the response as well here is a pro tip ask the AI to rate each
8:31:44
response and then refine it but always verify the output for quality and ask
8:31:50
again if necessary I've prepared a very nice document with various examples on how to use prompt Engineering in
8:31:55
including what to do and what to avoid the document is inside our web design Community if you are not a member yet
8:32:01
you can join now for free by going to web designers collective.com and you will find the document inside the
8:32:07
classroom section in this lesson you've learned what promp engineering is why it's important for ux and research and
8:32:13
how to write effective prompts in this lesson we will explore how AI agents are impacting the digital
8:32:20
landscape by handling tasks that once require manual input and decision making the systems ranging from simple
8:32:27
chatbots to complex virtual assistance are becoming very valuable tools for automated processes Gathering data and
8:32:35
also enhancing user experience you will learn how AI agents work and why understanding them is critical for
8:32:41
building modern user Center websites AI agents are systems or
8:32:46
programs that can perform tasks independently make decisions and adapt to user inputs these agents leverage
8:32:53
artificial intelligence techniques like machine learning learning and natural language processing to learn from their
8:32:58
environment and enhance user interactions from simple chat BGE to more complex virtual assistants like
8:33:04
Siri or Alexa AI agents are becoming essential for automating task and personalizing user experiences on
8:33:11
websites think of AI agents as digital assistants that like skill human helpers
8:33:16
handle repetitive tasks and technical details so that designers can focus on the creative and strategic aspects of
8:33:22
their work just as Michelangelo and daish relied on assistance in their workshops to mix paints prepare canvases
8:33:29
and execute parts of larger Works web designers today can rely on AI agents to handle repetitive tasks like data
8:33:36
Gathering um content generation or basic design adjustments in the Renaissance
8:33:41
these Master artists still control the overall vision and critical elements of their masterpieces similarly AI agents
8:33:48
Empower web designers by enhancing their efficiency but the creativity and strategic Vision remain in human hands
8:33:56
while the AI agent handles the technical leg work the designer ensures that the final product aligns with the Project's
8:34:02
goals and user needs much like how Michelangelo would oversee every detail
8:34:07
of his work even when uh delegating small tasks this analogy highlights the idea that AI is a tool to enhance and
8:34:15
not to replace human creativity so AI agents are basically like modern day apprentices providing support and
8:34:22
enabling you to achieve more without deleting the creative essence of your work now let's talk about what designers
8:34:29
should learn about AI agents though AI agents may seem more related to development and design understanding
8:34:35
them is crucial for web designers when users interact with AI systems whether through chatbots virtual Assistance or
8:34:42
personalized recommendations it's our responsibility to ensure these interactions are smooth intuitive and
8:34:49
enjoyable and good design ensures that the user interface of an AI system is user friendly designers must consider
8:34:56
how AI will respond to U you know to the users and how users will perceive the ai's actions creating a bridge between
8:35:03
technical functionality and human interaction and keep in mind that designing for AI agents requires a shift
8:35:10
in thinking because unlike static designs a driven interfaces are Dynamic for example a chatbot interacts
8:35:16
differently with every user based on their questions or inputs and as a designer Your Role is to ensure these
8:35:22
interactions feel natural and seamless you need to consider Factor such as where to place the AI on a website how
8:35:28
to organize user flows and how to design fallback options in case the AI doesn't respond correctly so it's very important
8:35:35
to design an interface that is clear and easy to use I want to mention that even you may not code um you know the AI
8:35:41
agents yourself understanding how they work helps you design better products and communicate your ideas better with
8:35:48
the developers as AI agents become more integrated into websites it's important
8:35:54
for designers to think about their ethical use AI systems often gather um
8:35:59
user data to make decisions so designers need to ensure transparency in how that data is used you should always clearly
8:36:06
show users what data is being collected and why because that builds trust and encourages users to um you know engage
8:36:13
with the AI accessibility is another critical Factor AI agents should be designed to serve all users including
8:36:20
those with um disabilities and this applies to web design in general so always keep that in mind you can find a
8:36:27
link in the description to a document that provides multiple real world examples helping you clearly understand
8:36:33
how AI agents can be use in web design in this lesson you've learned what AI agents are why designers should learn
8:36:39
about AI agents and the importance of ethical and user centered AI design AI
8:36:46
is evolving rapidly and it's important to stay ahead of the curve as a designer in this final lesson we look uh to the
8:36:53
Future and explore how AI will continue to impact design we'll discuss the difference between today's AI models and
8:37:00
what's coming next with AGI and more importantly you will learn how to prepare for these changes so that you
8:37:07
can continue to thrive as a designer no matter how the technology changes traditionally web designers handed off
8:37:13
their designs to developers who were responsible for coding the website especially more complex websites right
8:37:21
but with AI and no code tools the workflow is changing ing those who aspire to be a super designers to handle
8:37:28
the entire process themselves however for more complex or highly customized features working with a developer can
8:37:35
still be the most effective solution at least with the technology we have today so what's a super designer a super
8:37:43
designer is a highly skilled designer who not only understands the fundamentals of design and development
8:37:48
but also uses Ai and no code platforms to merge these skills this allows them to create entire websites or
8:37:55
applications without having to write the entire code from scratch it's like being a singer or
8:38:00
a rapper producer and engineer all at once in music by leveraging modern tools or a creative midfielder in football who
8:38:07
can play as a false nine Winger and is equally good at defending when necessary at the high level and if you know about
8:38:13
football you know soccer you know these kind of players are very rare and very valuable so imagine designing a website
8:38:20
and handling both the design and the development without writing code and as a super designer you are not a
8:38:26
traditional designer developer hybrid okay you are a skill designer using AI tools to build exactly what you
8:38:33
envisioned keeping full creative control while AI handles much of the work complex projects might still require
8:38:39
collaboration with developers however AI is closing the gap between design and development giving you more freedom and
8:38:46
speed to create better digital products so this is my main text tag and the
8:38:51
first thing I use is chat GPT and that's after reading the brief and understanding what the client wants I
8:38:57
use chpt as an extension of my brain to do some research and then I use CLA and Gemini
8:39:04
for more ideation and Analysis and then when everything is clear I use figma to
8:39:09
design the wire frames and high-fi design I also use fig gam inside of figma when I'm working with a team or
8:39:16
when I'm designing user flows and inside of figma as well I use some plugins to make my job easier you can find in the
8:39:22
description a link to a document that contains a Leist with all the plugins I use and then
8:39:27
after the design is complete I use webflow or framer to do the development I mainly use webflow for development but
8:39:35
sometimes I use framer and framer is not as established as webflow but it's a
8:39:41
very nice tool to explore okay and then I use it very often for prototyping but
8:39:47
I did not add that step here because I don't uh do prototypes all the time okay
8:39:52
most of the times I um you know go from design to development this is my
8:39:57
secondary text tag I use any type and TR for project management I use zoom for
8:40:03
video calls I use Photoshop for graphic design and then Google Drive for documents and storage Gmail for all
8:40:11
email Communications cly for call Scheduling Google analytics for web analytics and
8:40:17
then Google search console for SEO then H jar for web analytics as well and then
8:40:23
canva when I have to design something quick and simple dropbacks for storage and it's helpful to use dropbacks
8:40:30
especially when working with organizations that already use dropbacks
8:40:35
because it makes um you know sharing files and stuff way easier and then I use slack for daily
8:40:42
Communications here are some tools I'm currently exploring and I would recommend you to do as well Runway is an
8:40:48
AI video generator which is very interesting and then willum is an AI website builder very useful especially
8:40:56
when designing inigma Surfer is an SEO tool Sora is an
8:41:02
AI video generator as well created by open AI bubble is a tool that helps you
8:41:07
build functional apps without having to write code and cursor basically helps you bring your designs to life since it
8:41:14
helps you generate the code to make the website functional a question you might have is do I need deep development
8:41:20
knowledge to execute all this the beauty of no code platforms is that they don't require you to have deep development
8:41:27
knowledge okay a strong grasp of fundamentals such as how websites are structure responsive design principles
8:41:34
and user interaction Basics is enough these platforms take care of the technical complexity allowing you to
8:41:40
focus on design and user experience as long as you understand the basics no code tools enable you to achieve
8:41:47
professional results now let's talk about AGI and why should designers care AGI represents the next significant step
8:41:54
in AI evolution as I mentioned before unlike narrow AI which excels at
8:41:59
specific tasks AI aims to mimic the full capabilities of human intelligence this
8:42:04
basically means that AGI would be capable of learning reasoning and adapting across a wide range of tasks
8:42:10
much like a human being and this technology would possess the ability to understand and apply knowledge across
8:42:16
various domains making it far more versatile and adaptive the development of AGI is still
8:42:23
ongoing but its potential to revolutionize the design industry is immense let's now briefly explore the
8:42:30
potential of AI in design ai's ability to automate complex aspects of the design process could change how we work
8:42:38
but this doesn't mean that all areas of design will be overtaken by AI while AGI could potentially generate
8:42:45
amazing Creative Concepts user interfaces and even adjust designs based on real-time data there will be always
8:42:52
um you know spaces where the human touch will be replaced this is particularly true in Industries
8:42:58
like high-end luxury brands for example where craftmanship attention to detail
8:43:03
and emotional connection play an essential role take L with Rolex Chanel
8:43:09
or Hermes as examples these Brands Thrive not only because of their beautifully uh designed products but
8:43:15
also because of the deep emotional connection they faster with their clientel the personal Artistry behind
8:43:21
the products the stories told through the designs the meticulous craftsmanship
8:43:26
and the scarcity are what make this brand so valuable and what I think is that as AI evolves the uniqueness and
8:43:33
human touch in many Industries will become even more essential offering a level of personalization and emotional
8:43:40
engagement that AI cannot replicate and the thing is we don't know 100% for sure
8:43:45
but this is the conclusion I have right now based on the available information here is why designers shouldn't fear AGI
8:43:53
the idea of AGI might seem inating right now especially when we consider its potential to take over tasks that have
8:44:00
traditionally require human intervention however designers shouldn't fear AGI in fact as I mentioned before I believe
8:44:07
that as AI evolves the human touch will become even more valuable in Industries
8:44:12
where creativity emotion and individuality are key AGI will most likely struggle to replace the uh deep
8:44:19
human connection that skill designers bring to the table here is how to prepare for AI designer should focus on
8:44:25
the aspects of the profession that AI can't easily replicate the ability to infuse a product with Artistry emotional
8:44:32
depth and personal expression will remain a Hallmark of great design especially in sectors where
8:44:38
individuality and exclusivity are a Paramount in addition to mastering human Center of design designers should
8:44:44
continue to nurture their creative thinking AI might be able to generate Amazing Ideas Based on data but human
8:44:51
creativity is rooted in imagination abstract thoughts and the ability to challenge conventional norms and these
8:44:58
qualities are what set great designers apart especially in Industries where Innovation and originality are key
8:45:05
staying adaptable and curious will be essential as AGI evolves by continuing to learn new tools and techniques
8:45:11
designers can ensure that they are prepared to collaborate with AI using it as a tool to enhance their creative
8:45:17
output rather than seeing it as a competitor AGI may take over some of the more technical or um datadriven aspects
8:45:25
of design but it will allow humans to focus on the most strategic creative and emotionally engaging parts of the
8:45:31
process when I talk about the importance of human Essence and craftsmanship I don't mean you should dismiss AI
8:45:37
altogether okay I mean that you should use AI to enhance your human capabilities rather than ignoring AI due
8:45:43
to fear of the new or unknown this is what I mean let's look at this diagram for example if you dismiss Ai and stay
8:45:50
here you will be missing out on so many opportunities to streamline your work boost creativity and push boundaries
8:45:58
that weren't possible before on the other hand if you rely entirely on AI and forget the importance of the human
8:46:04
touch you risk losing the unique qualities that make your work stand out like emotion intuition and personal
8:46:10
craftsmanship the key is to find balance between leveraging AI as a tool and
8:46:15
maintaining your human creativity by doing this you create something far more powerful a Synergy where AI enhances
8:46:22
what you do best without replacing in it AI should be seen as an extension of your skills not a substitute for them
8:46:29
this balance will allow you to thrive in this new era where Ai and human Talent can coexist and complement each other

or not what AGI is and why it's important the potential of AI in design
8:47:06
why the human touch will remain important in this new era why designers shouldn't fear Ai and how to prepare for
8:47:13
AI as a conclusion to become a super designer master the fundamentals of design first you know typography color
8:47:21
theory layout user experience and all that this principle principles form the foundation of your work once you master
8:47:28
the basics explore how AI can enhance your workflow by automating tasks um you
8:47:34
know sparking creativity and providing valuable insights as AI evolves it will automate many design aspects but
8:47:41
designers who focus on developing creativity empathy and cultural awareness will Thrive rather than
8:47:48
fearing artificial intelligence embrace it as a tool to elevate your unique abilities and focus on what makes uh
8:47:54
design truly special the Deep connection between creativity and Human Experience
8:48:00
congratulations on completing module 7 in the next module I will guide you through setting up a powerful and
8:48:06
efficient digital workstation designed to maximize your productivity and time efficiency many web designers struggle
8:48:12
with staying organized and obviously they work sers because of daily chaos and I used to be like that I used to be
8:48:18
in the same both right but once I change my Approach my Revenue my efficiency and
8:48:24
my focus has all increased in this video I will guide you through setting up a powerful yet simple digital workstation

8:48:51
you take your work to the next level so let's begin here you can see all the lessons we'll
8:48:58
cover in this lesson we'll be exploring Google workspace one of the most powerful and accessible productivity
8:49:04
suites available whether you are organizing projects communicating with clients or restoring design files Google
8:49:11
workspace offer all the essential tools to keep your workflow smooth and efficient so let's dive into how you can
8:49:17
set up your Google workspace as a web designer the first thing you have to do is go to google.com/ Gmail and then open
8:49:25
a Gmail account to do so click here and then select for my work or business okay
8:49:33
and then it will take you to this page ideally you would choose uh the
8:49:39
business account so this option right but you will learn how to um set up your
8:49:44
business account in module 10 when I teach you how to build your portfolio Okay because you will need a
8:49:50
professional email so keep that in mind for now choose this option to open your personal account and if you already have
8:49:58
a Gmail account that you use for you know for your personal life okay um make
8:50:03
sure you are not using that one for your business okay so open a separate one only for business all right so click
8:50:10
here add your information here and then click next now you will see this page
8:50:17
and you have to select this option create a Gmail address and then click
8:50:22
next in this page you can write write your Desir username and then next then
8:50:28
here you write your password and then next here you have to add your phone
8:50:34
number for verification and then after that you click here now you can add your recovery email
8:50:41
and I suggest you to add your personal email and then you click on next here
8:50:47
you can add your phone number again and then next here Google is asking you if
8:50:53
you want to associate your phone number to your account if you want you can click yes or you can skip I will click
8:51:00
on yes now you will see this screen where you can review your information and then click on next now you will see
8:51:07
this screen that will ask you to choose your settings so you can just um choose
8:51:12
express and then click on next now you will see this page you can read all this and then click on accept all check your
8:51:21
settings and confirm by clicking here now you can read the Privacy terms if
8:51:26
you want and then go here and click on I agree and now you will finally see your
8:51:31
Google account okay so now that the account is set up let's uh add a profile picture so
8:51:37
click here and then add a uh nice portrait of yourself all right now let's
8:51:43
set up the Gmail account let's go here and then click on
8:51:50
Gmail and now you can read this information right here and then select
8:51:55
this one continue with smart features and then next Now read this information so you
8:52:02
can know what this is about and then select this one and then
8:52:09
done click here now let's personalize the account a
8:52:15
little bit so let's go here and then see all
8:52:20
settings and now here this is very interesting because Gmail gives you a
8:52:25
little bit of time to undo when you send an email and the default is 5 Seconds
8:52:31
and I advise you to change it to 30 and this is very useful because sometimes
8:52:36
you send an email and you be like oh wow I have to change something so with this you have 30 seconds to rectify okay so
8:52:44
now it's set to 30 let's scroll down until we see
8:52:51
signature and then let's click here create new
8:52:59
add a name for example signature now click on Create and then
8:53:06
you will see this box okay so click here and then add a signature something like
8:53:12
this for example now scroll down a little and you
8:53:20
will see uh these options right here so what it says for for new email um use
8:53:26
select main signature and then here as well and then check this
8:53:32
okay now scroll down and click on Save
8:53:41
changes now every time we compose an email we will see the signature right
8:53:49
here okay now let's do something very important let's go
8:53:55
here then click on more and then select this um you know like this Pam folder
8:54:03
and then let's drag it right here so we can see it at all times okay because
8:54:09
sometimes emails land in the spam folder and we don't want to miss any emails all
8:54:14
right now let's set the Google Drive so let's go here then we click here and
8:54:20
then we click on drive now we are inside of our Google Drive and the next thing we will do is
8:54:27
create three folders one for the design files another one for the archive and
8:54:32
then another one for deliverables and to do so we will go
8:54:37
here and then click on new and then new folder and then we will name our
8:54:45
folder design files and then
8:54:51
create and now we'll see the first folder
8:54:56
here now we'll create the other two folders so we'll go here again and then
8:55:01
we click here click new folder and then we name our
8:55:07
folder arive and then create and now we can see it here and
8:55:13
we'll do the same thing again
8:55:30
and now we have our three folders now let's click here to change the order
8:55:36
okay and then double click to open the folder now we are inside of the design
8:55:43
files folder now let's create some subfolders inside of this folder in
8:55:48
order to have um you know our files better organized so we right click new
8:55:55
folder and then we add a name for example um
8:56:00
images then create and then we do the same thing we
8:56:06
create another folder we can name it videos for
8:56:14
example and then we create another one for all the
8:56:22
files all right now we have these three sub folders
8:56:28
inside of this folder and now let's say we want to add an image inside of this folder okay so
8:56:35
we double click to open the folder and then we select the image we want to add
8:56:41
and then we drag and drop now we'll see
8:56:47
here how it's um you know uploading and we have it here okay
8:56:55
you can change the view if you want by clicking here and now you can see the thumbnail all
8:57:02
right okay now let's go back to the main folder and as you can see we have um
8:57:09
this view because we Chang it remember that we Chang it if you want to see it as a list you can click here
8:57:16
okay but I prefer to see it as a grid
8:57:22
Okay so now imagine that you want to change the
8:57:27
um the name of a folder you can right click and then rename and now you can uh rename the folder all
8:57:35
right and now let's say you want to share these um you know these folders
8:57:40
with the company or agency you are working with so you would go
8:57:45
here and then you can share the folders individually like you right click and
8:57:52
then share and now you will see this pop up and
8:57:59
here you can edit the permissions normally it's going to be um restricted
8:58:04
so only the people you invite will uh be able to access this folder okay so you
8:58:09
would just um add their um their email here okay and then done you can also
8:58:16
copy the link and share it with them elsewhere all right that's it
8:58:24
before we move to the other part of the Google Suite Let's uh create a uh Master
8:58:29
folder basically a folder that's going to be uh the project folder and all
8:58:34
these other folders will be inside so let's create that right
8:58:45
now for example and then create and now we have this folder okay
8:58:55
now we can select these other folders and then drag them
8:59:02
inside this is perfect for better organization and this is the folder you
8:59:07
would share okay there are many other options and sections inside of uh Google Drive so
8:59:14
feel free to explore them now I will show you how to create
8:59:19
and organize your document so the first thing we will do is go inside of this folder okay and then we'll create
8:59:27
another folder named
8:59:35
document now we double click this folder and then we go to
8:59:40
new Google Docs and then we click to create our document now you can rename the
8:59:51
document then add the content you want and then when you go back to your Google
8:59:56
Drive you will see it right here okay inside of the documents
9:00:04
folder let's go back to the document and then let's write something
9:00:09
right here so if we want to collaborate with
9:00:16
others and you know have them write comments and then uh write comments ourselves and all that stuff we can just
9:00:22
select whatever part of the text we want to comment and then right click and then
9:00:28
click here where it says comment and now this will pop up and
9:00:34
then you can write whatever comment you
9:00:44
want and then now this will be highlighted because there is a comment
9:00:50
right here if if you want to share this document you can do it so by clicking
9:00:57
here okay it's the same thing as sharing a folder all right and then you have
9:01:04
many other options here as well okay so as I said before feel free to
9:01:11
explore now let's go back to the drive and then let's create another
9:01:16
folder named
9:01:22
spreadsheets here we have it now double click and here is where we'll store all
9:01:28
our spreadsheets okay because you will probably be use in many spreadsheets so
9:01:34
it's better to have them in their um own folder and this is for the project
9:01:40
spreadsheets okay so any spreadsheet you share with your client your own business
9:01:45
and personal spreadsheets will go in different folders and your other documents and files as well don't worry
9:01:52
because we'll be setting up that in a moment to create a spreadsheet we do the same thing with the to create the
9:01:58
document we go here and then Google
9:02:04
Sheets and then after we click we will see our spreadsheet and spreadsheets can
9:02:09
be as simple or as complex as you want and you would use spreadsheets to track
9:02:14
your finances maybe to um you know track your Outreach efforts or even your diet
9:02:21
you know a lot of different stuff you could could use different apps to do that but I like to use Google Sheets
9:02:27
because first of all it's free and then it allows me to customize a lot of different stuff um I've prepared a bunch
9:02:35
of documents and spreadsheets you can use and to get access you have to be a member of our community and you can join
9:02:41
for free you can join now by going to webdesigners collective.com so once you join our community you go to
9:02:49
the classroom section right here and then you will see these cards okay and then you click on this one where it says
9:02:55
exclusive guides and documents and then when you click you will be taken to this page and here you will see a bunch of
9:03:02
different uh video guides and documents okay and then when you um scroll down
9:03:08
you will see the spreadsheets okay now it's just one spreadsheet but I will be
9:03:13
adding more so by the time you join you might see more documents okay depending on when you join so once you are in this
9:03:21
page go here and then click this link to access the spreadsheet all right and you
9:03:29
will see this spreadsheet okay now go to file right here and then click and then
9:03:34
make a copy and then you will see this now you
9:03:39
can change the name like you can rename it to something like this for example you add your
9:03:46
name and then freelance financial statements and then you click on make a copy and now this will open in a new tab
9:03:55
and it will be automatically saved into your Google drive right here
9:04:02
okay you can watch the module six of this course um where I explain this uh
9:04:09
spreadsheet okay so go to module 6 and watch it if you haven't because it's very
9:04:15
important okay now let's go back to our Google Drive and then let's create our business
9:04:22
and personal folders so let's create them right click and
9:04:27
then new folder and this one can be called um
9:04:32
freelancing and then we create another one name
9:04:45
personal now let's go inside of the freelancing folder we double click and then we create a sub folder and then we
9:04:53
name it documents then we create it and then we
9:05:01
create another one we name it
9:05:10
spreadsheets and then another one
9:05:16
other files and then another one for our
9:05:29
archive and these are the main folders but you can create all folders to add
9:05:35
more stuff you want to have in here okay now let's go back and now we can move this um
9:05:43
spreadsheet inside of the um spreadsheet sub folder that's inside of the
9:05:49
freelancing folder okay and to do so we click here these three dots and then we
9:05:55
go to organize and then move and now this will pop up
9:06:03
okay and what we have to do now is click here on this Arrow okay on view contents
9:06:09
and spreadsheets and then move okay and now as we can
9:06:17
see it's inside inside of Google Drive you can create all amazing stuff for example you
9:06:25
can create Google Slides you know Google forms and Google slides are very useful
9:06:31
but I prefer to use figma okay to design my presentations and in module 12 I will
9:06:38
show you how to design beautiful presentations to support your meetings with potential clients okay okay so now
9:06:45
it's time to talk about the Google Calendar Google Calendar helps you stay on top of deadlines and
9:06:52
meetings you can schedule client review sessions or project Milestone dates and
9:06:58
time block your own work periods for a deep focus on design or management tasks
9:07:03
and also Google Calendar integrates seamlessly with Google meet um making it easy to set up and host the virtual
9:07:10
meetings with clients to access the calendar go here and then
9:07:15
click and then click on calendar and the first thing you will
9:07:21
see is this um you know pop up and you can use it to download the app into your
9:07:28
phone all right you can change the view of the calender so now it's set to week
9:07:34
I like to set it to month all right so now we can see the entire month and once I have this view
9:07:41
what I like to do is to create um this schedule for deep work okay so for
9:07:48
example for me I choose from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and that's for hours and I
9:07:53
recommend you to um you know to log in 4 hours at least for deep work that's the
9:08:00
same thing I advise you to do in modu one okay so at least for hours if you can't because you have uh different
9:08:07
responsibilities and then um you have another job or whatever you can reduce
9:08:12
it to three or two or whatever you can the important thing is that you have a couple of hours at least of deep work
9:08:20
okay ideally 4 hours but if you can can't then whatever you can okay so
9:08:25
let's set it up to do so let's click inside of a day for example uh Monday
9:08:31
all right the 14th and then you will see this pop up then here you can add a name like the
9:08:38
work for example and then add a time and in my case it would be 700
9:08:47
a.m. to 11:00 a.m. okay for hours and then here it
9:08:53
says does not repeat then you select daily if you want to work every day or you know every
9:09:02
weekday okay in my case I would choose every weekday all right and then here
9:09:08
you can select your time zone all
9:09:14
right you can change it if you have to and then click okay
9:09:25
and now click on Save and you will see it
9:09:31
appear okay and then the next thing I want you
9:09:36
to set is basically 30 minutes okay every day to soak in
9:09:42
inspiration and this is extremely important I will leave a link in the description with a bunch of different
9:09:48
websites you can use but it's basically 30 minutes that you will use to observe
9:09:55
contemplate and appreciate great design I will also link some amazing design
9:10:01
books inside of the document okay so you can get it by clicking the link in the description I like to set these 30
9:10:08
minutes right before my deep work session so that's what I will do click
9:10:15
here and then we can call it inspiration
9:10:24
and then we do the same thing we did okay at day time then this will
9:10:33
be 6:30 to 7:00
9:10:39
a.m. and then every week day and then we
9:10:48
save and now here we have it okay every weekday
9:10:55
now if you want you can uh change this to week so you can better see the time
9:11:03
in a graphic way and you can change the colors as well like you
9:11:08
click and then edit and you can change it
9:11:15
here and then save and then all events so it changes
9:11:21
the color on all the events okay and then
9:11:28
okay and now you can see it all right let's change it back to
9:11:37
month and these are the essentials okay at least every weekday okay and if you
9:11:44
can't every week day try to um you know maximize the times you do deep work and
9:11:51
the times you um you know um soaking inspiration okay and the good thing
9:11:58
about this is that you can have a view of everything you do every day okay and
9:12:04
if you don't do these things right when you open the calendar and you see them
9:12:10
then you will know that you are full off okay seeing this every day helps you stay accountable and now that we have
9:12:17
the essentials you can add other stuff like for example your hours of sleep you
9:12:22
know um your hours of going to the gym and then the hours you spend time with
9:12:28

9:17:48
can rename the list right here all right and you have a bunch of
9:17:54
different options so feel free to explore now I will show you how to use
9:18:00
Google keep which is basically an app that helps you write and organize quick notes and to access the app just go here
9:18:09
and then scroll down and click here now you can write a note right
9:18:18
here you can add a title
9:18:24
and then you have a bunch of different options you can share these with your clients or your team okay and then add
9:18:31
some customization and then attach images you can archive the note and then
9:18:37
here you have more options okay you can delete add a label you know all that
9:18:43
stuff and then you can also pin the note by clicking here okay and then if you
9:18:49
want Google to remind you about this note you can click click here and then set it up all
9:18:58
right you will see your notes here okay and what's nice about this app is that
9:19:04
you will also see the notes across the different apps inside of the Google site
9:19:09
for example let's go to the calendar and then when you click
9:19:14
here you will see your notes okay same thing if we go
9:19:21
to the Gmail account you will see your notes Here and
9:19:29
Now to end this lesson we'll go back to Gmail
9:19:34
okay and we'll organize our inbox all right so the first thing we will do is
9:19:40
to close this okay and then this now we will change the view okay so go
9:19:48
here click on settings and then scroll down until you see unread first then
9:19:56
check this and now you will see the unread emails here and everything else below
9:20:02
okay you can play around with the settings okay and and then customize it if you want but this is how I set up my
9:20:10
inbox now we'll set labels because um sometimes you will receive a lot of emails and you will miss a lot of emails
9:20:18
if you don't set labels so let's do it go to seal settings right here and then
9:20:24
go to labels right here and then scroll down until you see create new label and
9:20:30
then click now let's add a
9:20:36
name and then you can Nest labels um you know under another label but for now we
9:20:42
just click create and here we can see the
9:20:51
label here you can see the label as well and here you can you know add a color
9:20:58
for example green now let's assign this label to an email let's go back to the
9:21:06
inbox so this is what happens when you don't have labels okay let's say you have here hundreds or even thousands of
9:21:13
emails if you don't have labels you will miss a bunch of emails because it will
9:21:18
be difficult for you to identify them right so let's say this is a email and
9:21:23
we want to add a label we can do so by going here and then clicking here and
9:21:29
then adding the email
9:21:35
address so this represents you know um it's just like an example but this would be your client's email okay and then you
9:21:43
click on create filter and then apply the label and you select the label and make
9:21:51
sure to check this option option as well never send it to spam and then click on
9:21:56
create filter and now we have the um filter created so every new email from
9:22:03
this client okay will have a label let me show
9:22:08
you here is the new email and the label okay and now it's easier to see the
9:22:15
emails from this client and then if you go here where it says labels and you
9:22:20
click you will see all the emails from this client organized in this inbox so
9:22:26
labels are very useful I've prepared a document that you will find in the description of this video and in that
9:22:33
document you will find all the labels you have to create to organize your freelance web design business now I will
9:22:39
show you a very cool feature let's say it's Sunday morning and then you want to send an email but you want uh the
9:22:45
recipient to receive it on Monday so what you can do is schedule the sending of the email this is how you do it when
9:22:52
you compose an email you add a
9:23:01
recipient and then here instead of clicking on send
9:23:07
you click on more send options right here and then schedule send and now this will pop up here you
9:23:15
will see some preset dates and times or you can customize it by clicking here and then let's say we want to send it on
9:23:21
the Monday the 21st of October we click here and then we change the time let's
9:23:27
say we want to send it at 10:00 a.m. and then we click on
9:23:34
send and now we'll see the scheduled email
9:23:42
here Google workspace is a powerful Suite that helps you stay organized collaborate effortlessly and manage all
9:23:49
aspects of your web design projects as you you begin integrating these tools into your workflow you will notice how
9:23:56
much smoother your project management and client communication can be in the next lesson we'll dive into more tools
9:24:02
that will enhance your digital workstation in this lesson you'll learn how to set up and organize your Google
9:24:08
workpace let's move to the next lesson as a freelance web designer you rely on several online tools research resources
9:24:15
and client communication channels keeping your browser organized can drastically improve productivity and
9:24:21
streamlining your workflow in this lesson we'll explore key strategies to organize Google Chrome so that you can
9:24:27
manage your projects efficiently um I want to mention that you should keep your personal uh Chrome profile and your
9:24:35
freelancing Chrome profile separated okay because if not it's going to be chaotic so make sure to do that and you
9:24:42
can do that by going here and then clicking on your profile right and then
9:24:48
here you will see your other profiles and if you don't have any profiles here
9:24:53
you can click on ADD and then this will pop up and here you can sign in
9:24:59
okay and every time you want to switch to a different profile you can do so by
9:25:05
going here again and then choosing your other the
9:25:11
profile so with Google Chrome open we will activate and organize our bookmark
9:25:16
bar okay so to do that let's go here and then click uh these dots right
9:25:23
and then go to bookmarks and list and then show bookmarks bar and then you click and it will show
9:25:31
right here okay now right click and then add folder
9:25:37
right here and this will pop up and then you add a name and you can name this
9:25:45
folder projects for example or client projects and then save
9:25:53
and here you have it okay and now it's time to create sub
9:25:59
folders inside of this main folder okay so it will be a folder for each client
9:26:04
so while we are hovering here we right click and then add folder and now this
9:26:11
will pop up and we will add a name for example client one all right and then we
9:26:19
save and now we'll see the folder inside okay and this is empty now but here you
9:26:27
would add a link to the client's folder inside of the Google Drive and also a link to the different specific tools you
9:26:34
are using for this client if you are using you know specific tools and also links to different files and documents
9:26:41
basically everything related to the work you are doing for this client okay now
9:26:47
let's create the subfolders inside of the client's folder to better organize it so we go here we click and then while
9:26:55
we are hovering we right click and then add folder and then we will create the
9:27:01
dashboard sub folder so we add a name dashboards and then we
9:27:10
save now we'll see it here okay and this folder will contain
9:27:17
basically all the dashboards we are using to work uh with this client for example a trao dashboard a Google sheet
9:27:25
dashboard or any of the dashboards you are using so now that you know how to create uh folders and subfolders I will
9:27:33
leave a link in the description with a document that contains the entire Google
9:27:39
Chrome folder structure so you can better organize your projects okay now let's create the next folder which will
9:27:46
be the inspiration folder we have add the
9:27:54
name and then we save inside of this folder you can add
9:28:01
all the um sources of inspiration like websites image galleries uh books
9:28:07
everything in this module I will teach you how to use a browser app called my mind save all your sources of
9:28:14
inspiration and then maintain everything organized but it's also nice to have
9:28:19
this folder right here in the books mark bar okay and to use all the capabilities of
9:28:26
the my mind app you have to pay a subscription okay and that's why having this free alternative that leaves inside
9:28:34
of your browser it's a good option for those who cannot afford to pay the um my
9:28:40
mind subscription you will also find in the document Linked In the description
9:28:45

9:31:31
clicking here so it shows every time you close it it shows here
9:31:39
okay you can mark it as red unread um you can delete it as well so use this to
9:31:46
add and organize black post articles case studies or whatever you want to to
9:31:52
read on Google Chrome you can also add extensions to enhance your workflow and you can do so by going
9:31:59
here and then where it says extensions and then manage extensions
9:32:05
and here in this page you will see all your extensions okay now if you want to discover and install more extensions you
9:32:12
can do so by clicking this link right here or also going into the menu and
9:32:18
then extensions and visit Chrome web store and it will take you to the Chrome
9:32:25
web store and here you can browse for different apps or you can directly
9:32:31
search and then when you see an extension you want to try like this one for example you go here where it says
9:32:37
add to Chrome and then you click and then you click here okay and it will add
9:32:44
the extension automatically to Chrome now you will see this right here
9:32:52
and when you click you will see your extensions and you can pin this extension here in the toolbar like when
9:32:59
you click now you can see it here okay and to access the extension now you just
9:33:05
have to click on this icon and here you have some options you can remove the
9:33:11
extension and manage the settings and all that stuff I will leave a link in the
9:33:17
description with a document that contains a list of a bunch of different extensions curated for web designers the
9:33:25
document will contain explanations of what each of the extensions do and some
9:33:30
use cases and examples as well before we move to the next lesson I want to show you something very important and it's
9:33:36
basically that you have to synchronize your account across multiple devices so whenever you log in in a different
9:33:43
computer you will keep all the custom settings and to do that you have to click on your profile right here and
9:33:50
then right now I have a it set to on but if it's off you will see an option to
9:33:55
set it to on in this lesson you learn how to organize Google Chrome to improve productivity and now it's time to move
9:34:02
to the next lesson in this lesson I will show you how to use an app I discovered not too long ago it's an AI power app
9:34:09
that helps you store and automatically organize basically anything that inspires you I always emphasize the
9:34:15
importance of staying inspired by browsing and curating different images videos designs patterns and
9:34:22
resources whether it's a color palette a font you love or a user interface design that catches your eye this app will help
9:34:29
you keep track of it all effortlessly before we continue I want to mention that I'm not affiliated with the company
9:34:36
that made this app so this is not a sponsor review or anything like that it's just my honest opinion and advice
9:34:42
and this applies to all the apps I show in this video the app is called my mind
9:34:48
and it basically works as an extension of your mind so instead of creating complex folder systems or worrying about
9:34:54
organizing inspiration manually which is a valid option too if you can't afford to subscribe to this tool I mean you can
9:35:01
use Pinterest figma a folder on your computer or other free tools but I like
9:35:06
this tool because it leverages AI technology to categorize and tag everything for you making it super easy
9:35:12
to find whatever you need later on and I know it's relative but this tool is not too expensive
9:35:25
and they even offer a free account as they as they say
9:35:32
here that you can use within some storage limits I will show you how to save web
9:35:38
design inspiration manage your references and build a collection of design elements that will fuel your
9:35:45
creativity you will basically learn how to use this tool as part of your daily workflow to stay inspired and organize
9:35:51
as web designer so the first thing you have to do is create an account so go here where it says login and then
9:35:58
click and you will see this page now click here and then sign up with
9:36:06
Google Now click here and then
9:36:17
continue now click here where it says set up my m
9:36:23
and then read this and click where it says I understand then click this
9:36:31
button and this one and then this
9:36:37
one now let's install the Chrome extension by clicking
9:36:43
here then choose Chrome and then add to Chrome
9:36:54
now you can see the extension here now let's pin the extension into
9:36:59
the toolbar by going here and then clicking here and now we can see the
9:37:05
extension right here now I will show you how to add stuff into your my mind so this is
9:37:13
search system a website that I use very often to find inspiration and this site
9:37:19
has like an infinite scroll that you can use to find um you know a bunch of different concepts for inspiration and
9:37:27
they also have this
9:37:32
index which is very well organized and you can find a bunch of
9:37:39
stuff let's click on websites and let's say that you like how
9:37:45
this markup is displayed so you click and then right click
9:37:53
and add to my mind okay so this one is saved let's add
9:37:58
something else let's go back to the index and then click on Cosmetics for
9:38:09
example and let's say we like this packaging which is incredible by the
9:38:15
way so we right click and then add to my mind
9:38:23
now let's say you want to save this tweet into your mind you can do so by clicking
9:38:33
here now let's say you like how this project is displayed so you save it to your
9:38:45
mind now let's say you are working on a project for a retail store and you need some inspiration and you like this
9:38:53
book so you save it to your mind now I will show you something very
9:38:59
nice let's say you are reading this article and then you like this passage you can select it and then write click
9:39:08
and add it to your mind and then when you go to the app you
9:39:14
will see now everything you saved so far even the passage of the
9:39:20
article link to the article now you will see something very
9:39:25
interesting when you go back to the app and then click here for example you can see how the app edit some tags
9:39:32
automatically you can even see right here some color codes inspired by this
9:39:38
image remarkable the search function right here is so smooth check it out
9:39:52
you can also write some
9:40:03
notes and create spaces to better organize
9:40:17
everything you can choose a color for this space and here you have it and whenever you
9:40:24
want to add something to a space like this website for example you right click and then add to space and you select the
9:40:32
space And now when you go to the space right here you will find the website
9:40:37
here so that's it it's very easy to use and you have more options here and then
9:40:45
here all right so check it out in this lesson you've learned what the my mind
9:40:50
app is and and how to use it now let's move to the next lesson in this lesson we are going to dive into how you can
9:40:56
use Trello to manage your clients and design projects effectively Trello is an incredibly flexible project management
9:41:02
tool that allows you to visualize your tasks track progress and collaborate seamlessly by the end of this lesson you
9:41:09
will know how to set up your trailer board organize client projects and Link important documents like briefs design
9:41:16
files and spreadsheets to keep everything organized in one place so let's let's get started the first thing
9:41:23
you have to do is go to tr.com okay in order to open an account and to do so
9:41:28
you go here and then click it will take you to this page and
9:41:34
then you click here where it says continue with Google and then you select your
9:41:40
account and then continue and you will be taken to this page now click
9:41:49
here and when you land in this page you can click skip on all the options and
9:41:54
then you will be taken inside of your dashboard now you can customize it a little bit I will change the background
9:42:00
color you can do it so by going here then clicking here and then change background and you can use some photos
9:42:07
they have um they have some preset colors as well or you can upload a custom
9:42:13
background which is what I will do right now so I will select this image as background
9:42:21
now it looks much better so in Trello we organize work by creating different boards like one for each client for
9:42:28
example and you will see all your boards here okay and now we have this one which
9:42:33
is the default board but we can change the name by going here clicking and then
9:42:39
writing whatever name we want so for this example I will write client
9:42:46
one and now it changes here okay now let's organize our board so these
9:42:53
are the three columns that Trello gives us by default but we'll create some more
9:43:00
so you go here and then click and then add a name We'll add a waiting review
9:43:08
and then add list then we create another one named on
9:43:13
hold and then add list and now that we have all our columns we will reorder
9:43:19
them so on hold will go here okay you can click and drag
9:43:24
and then a waiting review will go here okay so this is the
9:43:36
order let's capitalize this so the format is the
9:43:41
same okay okay now I will explain what each of these list should
9:43:49
contain let's archive these two so we can start from scratch click here and
9:43:55
then archive and then the same thing here okay so now it's
9:44:00
empty in this column you add everything you have to do let's say you start a a project and then you have to create the
9:44:08
mood board so you click here and then you write mood board and then you press
9:44:15
enter and then let's say after the mood board you have to create the wireframe so you do the same thing
9:44:22
then press enter and then after the wireframes let's say you have to do the Hi-Fi
9:44:28
design you do the same thing now you can
9:44:33
close and then when you click on each of these you will see this
9:44:41
window with a bunch of options okay and I will explain them to you right
9:44:48
now here below notific ations we can see this option and if we click this will
9:44:55
appear this eye and basically what uh what this does is that every time there
9:45:00
is a change or an update inside of this card will be notified okay and then we
9:45:07
can see this field where we can add a description when we click you can type
9:45:12
whatever all right and then you can add a priority um
9:45:17
to this card so for example the highest you know high and then when you close I
9:45:24
will show you it appears here so very
9:45:31
useful here in this area you will see the activity log so every time you add
9:45:36
something or make a change it will appear here so you can keep track and you can also write comments here and you
9:45:43
can tag people like by writing the ad and then you'll see your team members or
9:45:49
clients here or you can tag all members on the card or all members on the board
9:45:56
okay by clicking this button you can join a card and then you will appear here okay and you can leave if you click
9:46:04
again here you can see all the labels okay you can search for a label or you
9:46:10
can create one if you don't have a label or you want to create a new one okay and then you can write here the
9:46:17
title and then select a color and then create and now it will appear here okay
9:46:27
and here as well and if you click the label will expand so you can better see
9:46:34
it you can also add a checklist by going here and then clicking and here you can
9:46:40
change the title or you can keep it like this and then add and you will see the checklist right
9:46:47
here and then you can start adding um items like
9:46:53
for example and
9:46:59
then stuff like that right and then by clicking here as you complete the tasks
9:47:05
you will see the progress you can set dates by clicking
9:47:11
here and let's say the due date is U the 27th you click here and then here you
9:47:18
can set a reminder and then save and now you'll see here the due
9:47:25
date here you can add attachments and then you can also add
9:47:33
the location I mean some of these options you will probably never use but they are here and then you can add a
9:47:39
custom cover for example let's say you can add like a color you can also upload
9:47:44
your own cover for example if you are designing a website you can add a um a screenshot of the side or something like
9:47:51
that or the design or whatever let's select this one for example and now you can see it
9:47:58
here and then you can also see it here looks nice you can also create custom
9:48:04
Fields by clicking here and then let's say we want to create one for a complexity we write the
9:48:11
name and then we select drop down and then we create the options like
9:48:18
high then medium and then
9:48:24
low and then we can add a color for each this like this like this for
9:48:32
example and then we click on Create and now we'll see it
9:48:38
here okay and then also right
9:48:47
here here we can see the powerups and when you click here it will take you to this page where you can see a bunch of
9:48:54
different Integrations and don't worry because before ending this lesson I will tell
9:48:59
you which apps you should integrate and how to do it let's close this for now you can also add some automations here I
9:49:06
don't use this option but feel free to explore and then here you have other options like to move this card to copy
9:49:12
to make a template to Archive and share very straightforward now I will show you the
9:49:18
workflow so here in the to-do list we have everything we have to do right so
9:49:24
let's say we started doing the mood boards all we have to do is click and then drag here to doing okay and then
9:49:32
after we complete everything we add it right here a waiting review and then here the client will uh leave some
9:49:40
comments and a little bit of back and forth and then after that we can move it
9:49:46
to done however if um the task is not complete because let's say the client is
9:49:52
taking too long to send information or whatever we move it to on hold okay and
9:49:58
that's basically it very simple now let's add some integration so
9:50:04
let's click here these three dots and then power
9:50:10
ups this page will open and then right here right
9:50:18
Google and then we'll add the Google Drive and also the Google
9:50:26
Calendar now we can close this
9:50:32
this and now when we click a card we'll see the integration right here and then
9:50:38
now we have to connect our Google account so we click and then let's say we want to attach a file we click and
9:50:46
then link Google Drive account now this will pop
9:50:51
up then we click on our account and then
9:50:57
continue select all we scroll down and then
9:51:03
continue now we click on aach a file then we will see all of our files
9:51:09
and folders inside of our Google account then you can select a file by
9:51:14
clicking and then clicking select and now it's here
9:51:20
and if you click it will take you to the file in this case this image now let's connect our Google
9:51:28
Calendar so let's click on this card and then right here where it says Google calendar events we click then we click
9:51:35
on authorize and then this window will pop up we scroll
9:51:41
down and then allow now let's click again on the
9:51:48
card and then let's go here here where it says Google calendar events again and
9:51:54
then open settings and now you'll see this pop up
9:51:59
and then we click on add new and we select our Google account here and then
9:52:05
we'll see this popup we click on our account and then
9:52:10
continue select all we scroll down
9:52:19
continue and now we select our email we select our
9:52:24
calendar this one and then next here we choose one way sync from Trello to
9:52:30
Google Calendar to avoid any mixups between different client boards this way
9:52:36
it TKS and deadlines from Trello will show up in Google Calendar but changes made in the calendar won't affect Trello
9:52:43
this keeps everything organized by client while still letting abstract deadlines visually in Google Calendar
9:52:49
now you can save and that's it you have to keep in mind that with the free plan you only can add one power up per board
9:52:56
so if you can't afford this subscription right now it's fine but you'd have to
9:53:01
make the updates manually so this board is already connected with Google Calendar so let me
9:53:08
show you for example let's go here where it says wireframes and then let's add a
9:53:13
due date for example the 29th and then save
9:53:21
now when we go to our Google Calendar and refresh the page we can see the wi
9:53:26
frames here okay perfectly
9:53:33
synchronized now let's say you have another client and you want to copy the structure of this board you can do so by
9:53:39
going here and then clicking the three dots and then copy board and then uncheck this add a name
9:53:48
for example client two and then
9:53:54
create and now you will have an empty board and to differentiate this board
9:54:01
from the other one we can change the background color by going here and then
9:54:06
change background and then we can change the background here and now every time we switch boards
9:54:14
the background changes all right that's it now you know
9:54:19
how to use and as always feel free to explore because there are many more options but
9:54:26
you don't need to use every single option okay keep it simple in the next lesson I will show you how to use slack
9:54:33
for ongoing Communications in this lesson you learn how to set up and use Trello to keep
9:54:38
your projects and client communication organized and also how to integrate Trello with Google Drive and calendar to
9:54:44

want slack to notify you on direct messages mentions and keywords or
10:00:39
nothing and I advise you to select this one direct messages mentions and
10:00:45
keywords and on keywords you can write your name
10:00:51
so in the case someone says your name without directly mentioning you you will get notified when you scroll down you
10:00:58
can set a notification schedule that aligns with your work hours and then if
10:01:04
you scroll down you can see more options to further customize your notifications

10:04:08
slack with a Google Drive Google Calendar zoom and Trello for a seamless workflow in this lesson I will gu you
10:04:15
through the basics of backing up your Google drive files to a physical hard drive while Google Drive provides cloud
10:04:22
storage and easy access to your files from anywhere It's always important to have a local backup in case of Internet
10:04:29
issues or potential data loss a physical hard drive ensures you have an offline
10:04:35
copy of all your important documents and files making sure they are um safer and
10:04:40
accessible at the end of this lesson I will also show you how to export and save your figma files into your external
10:04:47
hard drive here is why you should back have your Google drive files to a physical hard drive number one
10:04:54
redundancy even though cloud storage is fairly secure having a local copy ensures your files are protected in case
10:05:01
of accidental deletions or if you lose access to the internet number two accessibility you can access your files
10:05:08
and documents anytime as I said even without internet connection which can be crucial when you are working remotely or
10:05:15
traveling number three security backing up to a physical drive at adds an extra layer of security for sensitive
10:05:21
documents or client files in terms of which hard drive to use you can use any with enough capacity but this is the one
10:05:28
I use and you can find it in different places like Amazon and in other stores
10:05:35
and they have different capacities the one I have is 5 terabytes but you can also get the two
10:05:43
terabytes which is a little bit cheaper now I will show you how to automate your backups the first first
10:05:49
thing you have to do is go to this URL okay I will leave it in the description of this video and then once you are
10:05:55
inside of this page click here where it says downloads and now click here where it
10:06:02
says download drive for desktop and then proceed with the installation after installing the
10:06:08
application you will see this window and you can sign up connect your Google
10:06:15
account and then sign in and you will see this message
10:06:20
now when you reopen the app you will see this window and here you will see the option to add a folder click here now
10:06:28
you will see this window pop up and as you can see I navigated to my external
10:06:33
hard drive and inside of my external hard drive I created this uh folder you
10:06:38
can name it whatever you want and then inside of this folder I have this other subfolders now I will go back and then
10:06:47
select this folder by clicking here where it says select folder and now as
10:06:52
you can see this will be my backup folder now we click on next and then got
10:07:00
it you can skip this and then
10:07:07
next now you will see this and you can click on next and now click here where it says
10:07:15
open drive now you will see that little window on the bottom left conf confirming that everything is
10:07:20
synchronized when you open the Drive app you will see this window and here you
10:07:26
can see all your folders and
10:07:31
files now I will show you how everything is synchronized I'm here on my Google
10:07:36
Drive and inside of the personal folder now I will add an image from my
10:07:43
computer to my Google Drive okay the image is here
10:07:51
and now when I open my local Google drive folder I can see the image here so
10:07:58
everything is perfectly synchronized okay now some heads up
10:08:03
let's say you want to create a backup and you basically try to create a folder
10:08:09
right here let me create a folder and let's say we can call it October
10:08:17
22nd back up then we try to copy this
10:08:22
entire folder here we'll see this error and
10:08:27
this happens because this is not the actual file it's just a link so
10:08:32
basically what you have to do is to download the spreadsheets and documents manually and you can do that by going to
10:08:39
the document or the spreadsheet and then go to file and then download and you
10:08:45
have many options here you can also use a to called Google
10:08:50
takeout and you can access by going to this URL and this tool basically helps you
10:08:58
download the content in your Google account and as you can see you have everything here from all these different
10:09:05
Google apps okay so what you have to do is go
10:09:12
here where it says the select all and then you click
10:09:20
and then you scroll down until you see Google
10:09:25
Drive and then you select it and then go to the bottom of the
10:09:32
page and then next steps now you will see this and here you
10:09:39
can select the destination and then the
10:09:46
frequency and then the file type and the file
10:09:52
size and when you are ready you click on create
10:09:57
export and you will see this message and that's
10:10:03
it now you can create a weekly task on your calendar so you are reminded to do
10:10:08
the backup every week let's say you want to be reminded every Friday so let's click here and then select
10:10:16
task and we add a title for example weekly backup and then we add a
10:10:24
time 12: p.m. for example and then we click here and then we select weekly on
10:10:31
Friday and then we save that's it now it's
10:10:36
here you can also see it on your tasks page right
10:10:44
here now I will explain to you why backing up your figma files locally is important
10:10:50
while figma is a highly reliable cloud-based design tool it's essential to consider local backups as part of
10:10:56
your design workflow relying only on cloud storage can leave you vulnerable to issues like Internet outages sync
10:11:03
errors or accidental deletions by regularly saving local copies of your designs you can protect your work
10:11:10
against potential data loss and also maintain more control over your design
10:11:15
versions especially if you are using figmas free plan with limited version history saving the figma file into your
10:11:22
hard drive is actually very easy you just have to go here and then click and
10:11:28
then file and save local copy and then you click now you will see this window and
10:11:35
this is inside my external hard drive and you can see here that I created a
10:11:40
folder for the figma backups so you can select the folder you can change the name of the
10:11:48
file if you want and then click on open and then
10:11:56
save and that's it now you can see the file right
10:12:03
here awesome in the next lesson I will teach you how to track and manage your time in this lesson you learn why
10:12:09
backing up your documents and files is crucial for data security and accessibility and also how to back up
10:12:15
your documents and files using a local or physical hard drive freelancing requires a strong grip on
10:12:22
time management especially if you are balancing it with a full-time job or juggling multiple projects in this

10:22:01
here now let's talk about productivity apps I firmly believe that having too
10:22:07
many apps and too many things to track can actually be counterproductive it's
10:22:12
like a paradox building complexity to remove complexity that's why I only use
10:22:17
one EXT productivity app obviously without counting the main apps okay and
10:22:22
that app is called momentum momentum is a simple elegant browser extension that helps me stay focused and that's it well
10:22:31
it's two extra apps actually the only other app I use is the alarm app on my iPhone whenever I have an important
10:22:38
meeting or task I set an alarm on my phone just in case I miss notifications from my calendar or other apps now I
10:22:46
will show you this app named momentum momentum is a minimalist Chrome extension that transforms your new tab
10:22:51
into a personal dashboard with a daily Focus to-do leas beautiful nature photos
10:22:57
inspirational quotes and other interesting stuff it basically helps you stay focused and organized by replacing
10:23:02
the default new tab with a beautiful distraction free interface it's basically designed to help increase your
10:23:09
focus and motivation throughout the day providing a simple yet effective way to manage your goals and daily tasks so
10:23:16
momentum has a free plan which is already great but if you want to further enhance your productivity you can also
10:23:23
explore the plus plan which has a bunch of different um features that are very
10:23:31

10:23:47

10:25:18
premium feature but they let you try it so when you

10:25:32
stay focused okay and when you click uh here these three dots you will see here when you hover you will see a bunch of
10:25:38
options and this method is called Pomodoro you may you may be familiar with it and here you can see the options
10:25:45
to complete the timer restart start the timer add 10 minutes and here you can
10:25:51
add a custom time for example let's say you want to focus for 40 minutes you can add it here and then the brakes you can

explore now let's talk about your schedule as a web designer having a schedule is crucial but many people live
10:31:00
with a lack of organization they wonder why they never seem to have time or make real progress and it often comes down to
10:31:08
poor time management I experienced this myself for a long time until I decided to take action and make a change so now
10:31:16
I will show you two calendars one for those working as a full-time freelance web designer and another one for those
10:31:22
balancing freelancing with a regular 9 to5 job let's dive in so this is the
10:31:28
calendar for the people that can work full-time as a freelance web designer and as you can see is very complete and
10:31:34
very balanced I will Zoom a little so you can see it as you can see is a structur in a way that you will have
10:31:40
time to work out to do deep work to learn new things to rest to read like
10:31:46
everything I will show you in a moment the calendar for those of you who have a 9 to5 job
10:31:54
but first I will tell you what you have to do with this framework what you have to do is to download this calendar you
10:32:00
will find the link in the description okay and once you have it you add all these entries one by one into your
10:32:07
Google calendar okay so we are inside of Google Calendar and if you did everything I
10:32:16
showed you in this video correctly every time you add a task on Trello it
10:32:21
will appear here automatically okay because it's synchronized same thing with cloi every
10:32:28
time you add an entry it will appear here without breaking the framework let me show you right now for
10:32:34
example if I go to Trello and then I add a new card I can call it review call for
10:32:42
example then I click here and then I click the card and then I add a date
10:32:49
here October 25th and then 1000 p.m. I click on
10:32:58
Save and then when I go to my Google Calendar sometimes we have to wait a
10:33:05
little you can see it here and this even if it overlaps with
10:33:12
all the entries doesn't break the framework let me show you for example if we go back to
10:33:18
Trello and then we change this to October 29th at 1: p.m. then we
10:33:29
save then we go back to the Google Calendar and then we go to the next week
10:33:35
we'll see it here as you can see it overlaps but it
10:33:41
doesn't break the framework all right this is for those of you who have a 925 job and it follows
10:33:48
the same structure as you can see okay the difference obviously is that
10:33:56
since your 925 job takes so much time you will have to work more during the
10:34:02
weekends okay obviously you will have less time to rest but the idea is that you have to
10:34:10
little by little transition into working full-time as a freelancer in this lesson you learn how

10:44:02
clients and protecting yourself legally registering as a business not only signals to clients that you are serious
10:44:09
and professional but it also opens doors to New Opportunities and legal protections that are often unavailable

to unregistered contractors in this lesson we'll explore why formalizing your web design work as
10:44:21
a business can enhance your reputation improve your client relationships and set a strong foundation for growth and
10:44:28
sustainability in your career so as I said before registering as a business um
10:44:34
signals to clients that you are serious about your work it helps you stand out in the competitive web design Market
10:44:39
especially among clients that prioritize reliability when you are registered client see that you've invested in your
10:44:45
business making you appear more uh trustworthy and capable of handling larger projects some clients especially
10:44:52
larger companies and agencies only work with a register businesses so registration can open doors to higher
10:44:59
paying projects that require a formal business setup registering as a business
10:45:05
makes it easier to secure contracts and work with established Brands which can significantly boost um your career as a
10:45:11
freelance web designer one of the biggest benefits of registering is the protection it provides with a registered
10:45:17
business um your personal finances and assets are separate from business finances this means that um if there is
10:45:25
ever a legal issue only the assets of the business not your personal savings or property are at risk and um this
10:45:33
separation can be essential for Peace of Mind especially as your client base grows registering also allows you to
10:45:40
access specific legal protections and support available to businesses which can further protect you in this lesson
10:45:46
you learn how registering as a business adds professional credibility how it can open doors to higher paying projects and
10:45:52
also how it separates your personal finances from your business finances for more protection now let's move to the
10:45:58
next lesson choosing the right business structure is a critical decision for web designers looking to establish a
10:46:04
registered business the type of entity you select whether a sole proprietorship LLC or Corporation affects your
10:46:11
liability tax obligations and growth potential in this lesson I will break down the main business entities their
10:46:18
benefits and drawbacks and guide you through selecting best fit for your goals as a web designer all right so
10:46:23
there are three main types of business structures suitable for freelance web designers so proprietorship LLC and
10:46:31
Corporation each type has its advantages and the disadvantages depending on your business goals so proprietorships are
10:46:38
the simplest to set up while LLC and corporations provide more legal protection and may be better for future
10:46:45
growth as I said before a s proprietorship is the easiest and least expensive business structure to
10:46:52
establish however in this structure there is no legal distinction between you and your business this Simplicity
10:46:58
can be beneficial for beginners but uh keep in mind that it doesn't protect your personal assets and assets are
10:47:04
basically anything valuable you own for example your cash in the bank your equipment your property or Investments
10:47:12
if you are just starting out and earning a small income a s proprietorship can be be a practical
10:47:18
option but it may not be the best choice as your business grows and you take on more responsibilities and risks and LLC
10:47:25
is a popular choice for Freelancers because it provides personal asset protection without too much complexity
10:47:31
this structure creates a legal distinction between your personal assets and the business shielding you from
10:47:37
potential business liabilities a corporation offers even more protection and growth opportunities but comes with
10:47:43
higher costs and more complex tax requirements if you are planning to operate as an
10:47:48
agency and grow significantly a corporation might be worth considering for most freelance web designers and LLC
10:47:55
strikes the right balance between Simplicity and protection so here are the decision-making scenarios if you are
10:48:01
a part-time designer with low income consider a SLE proprietorship to keep things simple if you have consistent
10:48:08
clients and stable revenue and LLC provides business credibility and basic asset separation while remaining
10:48:13
flexible if you plan to operate as an agency grow significantly and possibly higher you might start with an LLC for
10:48:20
Simplicity and later convert to a corporation as your business skills this provides the foundation for growth while
10:48:26
keeping your initial setup manageable here is an important consideration converting an LLC to a
10:48:32
corporation is a significant change and you should consult with a tax professional to get everything right in
10:48:38
this lesson you learn the main type of business structures and their key differences in this lesson we'll explore
10:48:44
key factors such as income level client demands and long-term goals to help you decide when registering your business
10:48:50
makes sense for you in terms of income level there is no fixed income level at
10:48:56
which you must register your business but a steady income can indicate its time registration becomes more
10:49:03
beneficial when you are making consistent earnings even if they are modest as I said before it can help you
10:49:09
access more tax benefits and protect yourself legally making it worthwhile for a long-term freelance career so if
10:49:17
you are regularly earning from web design registering can help establish your professional identity and protect
10:49:23
your growing income as I also said some clients require Freelancers to be registered businesses before they'll
10:49:29
hire them if you find yourself facing this type of clients or want to buid on
10:49:34
a projects that have formal requirements it might be time to register having a register business can
10:49:41
also make it easier to handle contracts and uh manage client relationships professionally
10:49:47
when you are officially registered clients know you are committed to the work which can increase their trust and
10:49:54
confidence in your abilities different business structures offer varying tax advantages in the US
10:50:00
all legitimate businesses regardless of structure can deduct expenses like software equipment and stuff like that
10:50:08
so proprietorships report business income on personal tax returns offering Simplicity llc's give owners flexibility
10:50:14
in how their business is taxed by default an LLC with one owner is taxed like a so proprietorship meaning the
10:50:21
owner reports business income and expenses on their personal tax return so you might be asking why not stay as a so
10:50:28
proprietorship and that's because the LLC offers more protection okay so your
10:50:34
uh personal assets are protected all right so if the LLC has multiple owners
10:50:39
it Stacks like a partnership where each owner reports um their share of the
10:50:44
business's income and expenses on their personal tax return however llc's can also choose to be tax like a corporation
10:50:52
which may help save money on taxes depending on the business's earnings and expenses in this lesson we learn about
10:50:58
the key indicators for knowing when to register as a business now let's move to the next lesson as we explored before
10:51:05
registering your web design business is an important step toward building a professional presence while the process
10:51:11
may seem complicated breaking it down into simple steps can make it much easier in this lesson I will guide you
10:51:17
through each part of the registration process from choosing a business name and structure to setting up essential
10:51:23
accounts by the end you will have a clear road map to register your business with confidence and start off on the
10:51:30
right foot choosing a name that resonates with clients and reflects your brand is essential ideally your business
10:51:36
name should be easy to remember unique and relevant to web design you can also
10:51:42
choose your own name or a variation of it a business name make sure it's available by checking with your local
10:51:48
business registry and searching online for matching domains a tool I like to use to search domain names is instant
10:51:55
domain search.com so if the name is available follow the registration process on your
10:52:00
government's Business website registration usually requires identification and as small fee if you
10:52:07
are looking to register a business in the USA online services can simplify the
10:52:13
process you can find a link in the description with a Leist with all the service providers I
10:52:19
recommend and I'm not affiliated with any of them these are Services I've used personally once registered open a
10:52:26
separate bank account for your business I recommend you to open a wise account to do so go to wise.com this step helps
10:52:32
keep your finances organized and simplifies tax preparation in some countries like the United States you
10:52:38
will need an EIN for tax purposes or if you plan to hire employees when you try
10:52:43
to open ay account you might be asked to enter an EIN and as they say here you
10:52:48
can just enter this until you have an EIN in this lesson we learn about the
10:52:54
essential steps to register as a business this lesson focuses on the basics of handling finances and legal
10:53:01
matters for freelance web designers we'll briefly go over essential practices like setting up a system to
10:53:06

10:53:13

10:53:19
valuable as a registered business you may need to make quarterly tax payments setting aside money for taxes regularly
10:53:25
can help you avoid large unexpected bills and my advice is to set up a separate bank account or a wise jar if
10:53:32
you are using wise um in order to control how much of your revenue is saved for taxes the amount you have to
10:53:38
pay depends on many factors and one of the most important factors is where are you based but don't worry about it right
10:53:44
now I will talk about it in more Det detail a little later good record keeping is key to running a successful
10:53:50
business so keep track of invoices expenses and income in an organized way
10:53:56
you know you can use software like QuickBooks for example or even spreadsheets to make sure you track everything and then when it's time for
10:54:03
taxes it will be way easier okay because everything will be organized and trust
10:54:09
me make sure to set it up from the beginning because if not you will have to do it like um last minute you will be
10:54:17
uh you know looking for invoices and this and that like um receipts and it's a nightmare so make sure to keep track
10:54:24
of it all from the beginning once registered you may need to complete annual reports or pay fees to keep your
10:54:30
business active these requirements very depending on your location so it's important to research what applies to
10:54:36
you missing these deadlines can lead to fine so make sure to set the reminders to complete any necessary filings and I
10:54:42
know that all these can be a little bit annoying but staying compliant allows you to focus on growth without
10:54:48

10:55:27
for international Freelancers including web designers registering a business in the United States provides several
10:55:33
advantages the United States has a stable economy robust legal protections and is home to a large network of
10:55:39
potential clients and reputable companies many US clients are more comfortable working with businesses
10:55:46
register in the United States as it simplifies payments contracts and
10:55:51
compliance with local regulations additionally us business registration offers benefits in terms of reputation
10:55:58
and legitimacy as many clients worldwide recognize and respect us-based
10:56:03
businesses registering in the United States can also streamline access to Major payment processors like stripe
10:56:09
PayPal and major Banks which may offer more favorable rates or service options

to us registered business bu this can be particularly beneficial for handling International payments and transactions
10:56:21
with less hustle as I said before if you are not a US citizen or resident you can still register a business in the United
10:56:27
States here is a stepbystep guide to help you through the process the first thing you have to do is choose a state
10:56:35
and Delaware Wyoming and Nevada are popular choices due to their business friendly regulations and low fees the
10:56:41
state I recommend for registering is a business in the United States for non-residents is Wyoming as it has low
10:56:47
fees and doesn't require public disclosure of ownership however keep in mind that laws and regulations can change so be sure to
10:56:54
do your own research before registering the second thing you have to do is select your business structure most
10:57:01
International Freelancers choose to register as an LLC because it's relatively simple to set up and maintain
10:57:08
and it also provides personal liability protection another option is a corporation which may be suitable if you
10:57:14
plan to scale your business significantly or seek investors and this only applies basically if you are trying
10:57:21
to build an agency and even if you are trying to build an agency I would recommend you to register as an LLC the
10:57:29
third thing you have to do is obtain a register agent and you will need a register agent with a physical address
10:57:35
in the state where you register this agent will basically receive official documents and
10:57:41
correspondence on behalf of your business many companies offer register agents Services specifically for
10:57:47
international business owners and can simplify the process you can find a link in the description with the ones I use
10:57:53
and recommend the next thing you have to do is apply for an EIN and the Ein is similar to a social security number for
10:58:00
your business and is requir for tax purposes and opening a business bank account non us residents can apply for
10:58:07
an EIN through the IRS and some service providers um offer EI assistance to
10:58:12
simplify this step in the same list um that contains the companies offering registered agent Services you will also
10:58:19
find um some companies that can help you apply for the Ein the link is in the description the next step is to set up a
10:58:26
US bank account or use online banking services a US bank account is essential for managing finances receiving payments
10:58:33
and maintaining smooth transactions if you are a US resident maybe you want to open a bank account
10:58:40
with uh Chase or Bank of America or whatever and even if you are not um a resident or a or a citizen you can go to
10:58:47
the United States physically and then open a bank account there but some non-residents like myself may prefer
10:58:53
online banking and I always recommend wise um which caters to International
10:58:59
businesses and allows you to operate remotely without a physical presence in the United States here are some
10:59:05
recommendations and tips for International Business registration in the United States even as a non-resident you may
10:59:13
still have us tax obligations depending on your income and client location
10:59:18
Consulting with a tax professional with experience in international business can help you understand how much tax you owe
10:59:24
any deductions you qualify for and the tax treaties that may apply to your
10:59:29
country all right this is very important you should always consider double Taxation and tax treaties double
10:59:36
taxation occurs when your income is taxed in both the United States and your home country to avoid this check if
10:59:41
there is a tax treaty between the United States and your country because that can help reduce or eliminate double taxation
10:59:49
keep in mind that if you are a US resident citizen or have a US registered company and LLC for example you might
10:59:56
have to pay uh taxes in the United States regardless of where you live since the United States taxes its
11:00:03
citizens residents and companies on global income okay so that's why I
11:00:08
always recommend to talk with a um tax professional because taxes can be
11:00:14
complex another thing I want to mention is that a US LLC is not the best option for everyone okay there are other
11:00:21
interesting options like the UAE and Estonia for example regardless of where
11:00:26
you register your business you have to keep in mind that you will have some extra costs like accounting bookkeeping
11:00:32
and all that stuff to make sure everything is accurate and organized you will find a link in the description with
11:00:39

11:03:08
maintenance and designing developing and Publishing your portfolio building a
11:03:13
successful portfolio requires thoughtful planning strategic choices before diving into design it's essential to clarify
11:03:20
your purpose Define your audience and carefully select the work that represents your skills and aligns with
11:03:26
your goals in this lesson we'll focus on laying the foundation for a portfolio
11:03:31
that doesn't just display your work but also tells a compelling story about who
11:03:36
you are as a designer by defining your audience and setting clear objectives you will be able to craft a portfolio
11:03:43
that not only resonates with the right people but also opens doors for the opportunities you are seeking planning
11:03:49
each element with intention will ensure that your portfolio service is a powerful tool to attract the clients
11:03:55
projects or roles that align with your vision for the future choosing the right platform to host your portfolio is
11:04:01
essential as it impacts your professional image and reach ideally a custom website with your own domain is
11:04:08
the best choice for full control and professionalism but there are also some good free options to consider here is a
11:04:14
quick overview of both types the first option and the one I recommend is frameware or webflow frameware and
11:04:22
webflow allow you to create fully customized polish websit with a full design control both support Uh custom
11:04:27
domains making them perfect for Freelancers aing for a nice website framer's userfriendly interface makes it
11:04:34
great for interactive design while webflow offers powerful detail control
11:04:39
ideal for those willing to invest in a premium look to use frameware or webflow to uh build your portfolio you have to
11:04:45
pay a monthly subscription fee which may not be ideal for everyone and that takes
11:04:51
me to the second option be hands be hands is a free community based platform perfect for building visibility and
11:04:57
connecting with other designers it's easy to upload and categorize projects making it ideal for those staring out
11:05:03
who want some exposure without the cost of a custom site bance allows your work
11:05:08
to be discovered by potential clients and peers the other free option is to use Google Drive and Google Slides
11:05:15
Google Google Drive and Google Slides provide simple free options for hosting your portfolio Google Drive lets you
11:05:20
organize project files and share them as a view folder while Google Slides can serve as a presentation style portfolio
11:05:27
with a coherent linear structure these Solutions are great for beginners or for
11:05:32
quickly sharing work with potential and existing clients the next option is dribble
11:05:38
dribble is a popular platform for designers illustrators and creatives who want to showcase our visually engaging
11:05:44
work and attract potential clients it allows you to post individual project shots making it ideal for showing off
11:05:51
specific design skills or Creative Concepts dribble is better for short visually compelling post and it works
11:05:56
well as a supplement to a main portfolio especially if you want to reach clients searching for specific design elements
11:06:03
figma is another option for hosting your portfolio especially if you prefer a design Focus environment with figma you
11:06:09
can create portfolio presentations directly in the app share live links and also organize your work in interactive
11:06:16
format it's also easy to update projects in real time making figma ideal for portfolios that require frequent updates
11:06:23
or client feedback LinkedIn is an amazing platform for building a professional Network and also for
11:06:29
reaching a wide audience although not a traditional portfolio platform LinkedIn allows you to share work samples build a
11:06:35
profile and increase visibility with other professionals adding a portfolio link to your profile can drive traffic
11:06:41
to a custom site or a behance portfolio for example your platform Choice should
11:06:47
align with your budget technical skills and career goals framer and workflow are best for those seeking a high quality
11:06:53
custom site on a custom domain while free options like beh hands dribble Google Drive and Google Slides provide
11:07:00
accessible effective ways to Showcase your work without any upfront costs
11:07:05
figma is also an excellent tool to host your project files allowing easy sharing with potential clients here is what I
11:07:12
recommend if you can afford a custom site use framework or web flow to develop it and then host all your
11:07:18
project files in figma for easy access organized figma files are crucial as clients May request them for insight
11:07:24
into your process also use LinkedIn to post portfolio updates expand your Professional Network and keep current
11:07:30
clients inform of your career growth and low services and finally supplement your reach with be hands and dribble which
11:07:37
can help expand your visibility and attract a broader range of clients if you're in a position where you can't
11:07:43
afford a custom site right now what you can do is share your figma files and upload high quality previews of your
11:07:49
work on Vance and dribble then as soon as you get paid from your first project build a custom portfolio site creating
11:07:57
portfolio pieces from scratch is a powerful way to demonstrate your skills even without uh client projects this
11:08:03
lesson will guide you through the process of developing self-initiative projects that reflect the type of work
11:08:09
you want to attract with careful planning and thoughtful execution you can create portfolio pieces that
11:08:14
showcase your strengths creativity and design approach the first step is selecting projects that align with your
11:08:21
career goals and Target orience think about the type of work you want to do professionally whether it's uh uxui for
11:08:27
e-commerce web design and branding for small businesses or uh web design for
11:08:32
agencies by choosing projects that represent your design Niche you can build a portfolio that attracts the
11:08:38
right clients and also the best opportunities start by identifying a few project ideas that excite you and our
11:08:45
relevant in the real world for example if you want to specialize in designing for fintech companies consider creating
11:08:51
a concept project for a fintech website if your focus is also branding create a
11:08:56
visual identity for a fictional fintech company make sure these concept projects are very high quality one of the best
11:09:03
ways to get feedback is to ask inside our community if you are not a member yet you can join by going to

11:09:21
objective and any challenges you aim to address this helps viewers understand the context and purpose of your work
11:09:28

11:09:34
present your designs in real world context like a Mobile screen or a desktop interface which helps viewers
11:09:42
visualize how your work would look in a live setting there are many free and paid mup
11:09:47
resources online I will leave a link in the description with my favorite ones a great portfolio isn't just a set and
11:09:54
forget okay it requires ongoing care and updates to stay fresh and relevant
11:09:59
maintaining your portfolio insures it reflects your current skills and any new achievements that may appeal to
11:10:05
potential clients and Employers in this lesson we'll cover strategies to keep your portfolio in top shape from routine
11:10:11
updates to refreshing concept projects and optimizing content for new visibility to keep your portfolio
11:10:17
aligned with your evolving skills and career it's essential to review and update it regularly schedule a portfolio
11:10:23
check every 3 to six months to add new projects update descriptions and refine
11:10:29
visuals each update should reflect your most current skills and work quality ensuring that potential clients see your
11:10:36
best most relevant work regular updates also give you the chance to um
11:10:41
experiment with new features design Trends or layout improvements helping your portfolio stay competitive in an
11:10:47
Ever Changing field if a significant shift happens in your career or a design Focus let's say you change your Niche
11:10:55
for example so in that case consider making larger updates to ensure your portfolio reflects this new Direction
11:11:02
not all projects will remain relevant over time and some may even lose their appeal as your design skills improve and
11:11:09
that's a good thing because that means you're advancing right so periodically review each project to decide if if it
11:11:15
still represents your current um skill level and the career Direction when a
11:11:20
project is outdated or no longer aligns with your goals consider removing it or updating it with more recent insights if
11:11:27
you display your work on multiple platforms like behance dribble LinkedIn and your website make sure each platform
11:11:34
is up to date with recent work consistent crossplatform updates reinforce your personal brand and ensure
11:11:40
potential clients see accurate current representations of your skills no matter where they find you as you complete new
11:11:48
projects request feedback from clients and consider adding their testimonials um to your portfolio client testimonials
11:11:54
build credibility and show that your work delivers results when Gathering
11:12:00
testimonials ask clients to focus on specifics okay like how your work solved
11:12:05
a problem or improve their business showcase client feedback strategically place testimonials alongside related
11:12:12
projects to add authenticity and Trust to your portfolio regularly updating testimonials also highlights your
11:12:19
current accomplishments making your portfolio feel current and credible to keep your portfolio visually engaging
11:12:25
don't hesitate to experiment with new design elements or layouts during updates even small changes like
11:12:31
refreshing colors updating fonts or even adding some minimal interactive features
11:12:36
can enhance the user experience and show that you care about refining and uh maintaining your work all right it's
11:12:44
about time to start design designing and developing a portfolio from scratch after design and development I will show
11:12:49
you how to publish it as I said in the intro this is an entire process and you will see me identifying mistakes
11:12:56
oversights and making changes as we progress you will find all the design files and resources in the description
11:13:04
remember that this is a marathon and not a Sprint so go at your own pce and if you get Stu let me know in the comments
11:13:11
or join our community for free at webdesigners collective.com for more personalized support to follow
11:13:18
along you will need a computer internet connection and access to figma and framer let's
11:13:24
begin all right so the first thing we'll do is create three pages and we have one
11:13:29
which is this one the default one and we'll change the name to to a
11:13:36
frames and the component and then we'll create another one and we'll call it design and then
11:13:44
another one and we'll call it archive now let's go to the Wi frames
11:13:50
and components page and now let's create the first frame and you can do it by pressing F on
11:13:58
your computer or by clicking here okay so when you click you will see
11:14:05
these options right here and then you select this one where it says best up
11:14:10
you click and here's the frame okay now let's zoom out a little
11:14:16
bit and then let's uh click on the frame and then we drag okay something like
11:14:23
this for now the next thing we'll do is to rename
11:14:29
the frame and you can do it by simply double clicking here okay or you can do
11:14:34
it by clicking here or you can do it by pressing control R while this Frame is
11:14:41
selected and then you can write the name and we'll name this Frame
11:14:48
desktop wif frame for now we'll tend it later normally when I'm designing the
11:14:55
wireframes I don't um you know set the local Styles okay like the color styles and all that stuff I wait until I start
11:15:03
designing the high-f five version but in this case I have a clear idea of the
11:15:08
colors I want to use so I will create the local Styles right now to create the local style we click on the C
11:15:15
and then here on the right side we click where it says local Styles and then we click on color and now we add a name for
11:15:23
our color in this case will be black and I won't use a Pure Black I
11:15:29
will use this instead which is a very dark gray and then we click on create
11:15:36
style now here we have it now I will create the style for the
11:15:43
main text which will be white and to do that let's go back here and then click
11:15:48
this plus sign and then we add the color name which will be
11:15:53
white and here you can either write the code which is 6
11:16:00
FS or you can click here on the Color Picker okay and then here you can select
11:16:07
whatever color you want in this case white and then
11:16:13
create here we have it okay so we have the black and the white I also like to create a secondary
11:16:20
dark color and that will be used in some cases where I want a subtle difference in contrast okay to create the color
11:16:28
style we do the same thing we go here and then we add the
11:16:33
name graphite for example and then this is the ca
11:16:39
code create it's a very dark gray almost
11:16:44
black but a little lighter than our black color okay so I created two more colors
11:16:52
you can see them here and if you want to follow along these are the color codes
11:16:59
okay and these are the only colors I will use okay in the entire
11:17:06
website okay now let's uh start designing the wireframes and the wireframes shouldn't be perfect
11:17:12
wireframes are just like a guide okay to understand the layout and to play around
11:17:17
so don't worry too much about alignment and stuff like that obviously everything has to make sense but don't try to be uh
11:17:24
Pixel Perfect before we continue let's add a name to the design file to do so let's go here and then click where it
11:17:31
says Untitled and then we add a name that's
11:17:36
it now let's select the background color for this Frame and to do so we select this Frame by clicking and then here on
11:17:43
the right side where it says fi we click right here and then we go to libraries
11:17:48
and we select the black color and the next thing we have to do
11:17:54
is start adding the elements inside of the frame and we'll start with the logo and obviously since this is just a y
11:18:00
frame most of the elements will be shapes okay so let's create a shape
11:18:05
which will represent our logo and to do so we select the frame by clicking and then you can create the shape by uh
11:18:12
going here and then clicking right here when you click um this Arrow you can see
11:18:17
different shapes but we will uh select the rectangle you can also create a rectangle by selecting the frame and
11:18:25
then pressing r on your keyboard and then you can draw the rectangle right
11:18:30
here something like this is fine and this will represent our logo don't worry too much about the size
11:18:36
of the elements okay because this is just a wireframe we will get the sizing right when we start designing the final
11:18:43
version now let's change the color of the shape because it's set by default to a light
11:18:50
gray as you can see right here okay so let's change it to White we
11:18:56
click here where it says libraries and then
11:19:02
white now we'll create another shape which will represent our menu and we'll place it right here okay on the right
11:19:08
side and to do it we can just select this shape and then press alt on our
11:19:13
keyboard and then click and drag right here okay and then we can
11:19:20
stretch it by dragging right here and this will be our menu and now let's select it and while
11:19:27
we press shift on our keyboard let's move it to the right side right
11:19:33
here now let's continue creating the other elements now that we have the logo and
11:19:39
the menu we'll create another element which will be a text describing who you
11:19:45
are and what you do and when I'm creating a wireframe I like to represent
11:19:50
text with multiple lines and we'll do it by creating a copy of this shape okay and then we move it here and then we
11:19:57
make the shape thinner like this now we can select it again and then enlarge it
11:20:05
like this now let's create two copies of this
11:20:12
by doing the same process one and another
11:20:18
one and this area is very important because here you will describe basically
11:20:23
who you are and what you do and this is one of the most important parts of your portfolio people when they go to your
11:20:29
portfolio they have to immediately know what to do and this description has to be very concise and to the point okay
11:20:37
like no fluff you will have more space to explain more about you in the about
11:20:43
page now let's create next elements but first I want to mention something I love
11:20:48
to create asymmetric designs okay I don't like to have everything aligned in one side or the other or everything like
11:20:55
perfectly aligned I like to mix it up a little you know I like to use a white space I like to break the monotony a
11:21:03
little bit I like to break the rules sometimes and to do that you have to first understand the rules okay and
11:21:08
always be intentional when you break them okay let's continue the next element I will create is the title and
11:21:15
even that uh this is a wireframe and I use shapes for almost all elements I actually like to write the titles and
11:21:23
this title will say work okay so now let's create the title by clicking on the frame and then pressing t on our
11:21:29
keyboard and then we click again and then we write work as you can see it's
11:21:34
like very small because the default uh font size is 12 but we can resize it by
11:21:41
clicking on the text and then right here here on the right side you will see this panel and
11:21:48
we can change the size like something like 100 pixels for example and then
11:21:54
here we have it now we can move it to the center right
11:22:00
here and as I said before this can be work or
11:22:06
projects or latest projects okay so whatever you want I
11:22:13
like to use
11:22:19
work before adding the other elements below the title I like to add right here
11:22:25
on the left side or the right side sometimes the services that I offer and
11:22:30
I will do it by creating a copy of these text elements so I select all of them
11:22:36
okay and then I create a copy and then I'll make them shorter
11:22:45
and then thinner as well and I will place it in line with
11:22:51
the title and here I will add my three main
11:22:56
services like web design uxu design and The Branding for
11:23:03
example I chose to start with an introduction in the services here rather than a fancy hero image or video um you
11:23:11
know to quickly communicate a focus message that encourages your target audience to explore the rest of your
11:23:19
portfolio so the message has to be very short and direct okay so for example if
11:23:24
you are trying to attract creative agencies you can write something like I am a web designer or you can also say U
11:23:31
are designer who collaborates seamlessly with product teams to craft intuitive digital experiences that users naturally
11:23:39
love or let's say you want to attract recruiters from Apple you would say something like I am a uxu designer and
11:23:46
here I wouldn't choose web designer okay because usually large companies uh hire
11:23:52
people specialize in these roles okay like these three roles and this is not
11:23:59
like the career path for everyone okay this is just a way for me to illustrate
11:24:04
one specific valid career path of I mean specialization path for web designers
11:24:10
because for example a web designer can specialize in uxui and then further specialize in ux or only Ur okay so
11:24:20
there are different variables all right let's continue with the wi frames now right here I will
11:24:26
place some shapes that will represent the preview of multiple projects here
11:24:32
we'll add four to six projects and they can be your best projects or your latest
11:24:38
projects so let's create um another shape by pressing the r key and then we
11:24:45
create a square this time something like this and then we'll make a
11:24:53
copy now we can select both and then while we press shift we resize them a
11:24:59
little bit so it's a little bit more
11:25:05
aligned like this is fine for now now while we have these two selected let's make a
11:25:12
copy place it right here here as I said before don't worry too much about getting a perfect spacing and Alignment
11:25:19
because we'll get that right in the next design phase now let's select the main frame and then stretch it a little
11:25:26
more something like this now I will change the color of
11:25:32
these of the representations of the images so I will select all of
11:25:37
them and then here on the right side I will change it to graphite
11:25:44
and this is just a uh you know like a design preference okay you can apply any color you want
11:25:50
basically now we'll add the project titles below these images so let's
11:25:55
create some space by selecting these two and then dragging them while we press
11:26:01
shift right here is fine now we'll copy one of these lines and remember click
11:26:08
press alt then drag we can place it right here here
11:26:15
then let's make it shorter by maintaining shift and then
11:26:20
let's make three copies one we'll place it right
11:26:25
here and then we'll make another copy and place it right here and then another
11:26:31
copy right here let's move this one up a little
11:26:40
bit right here let's add actually make these titles a little bit shorter because they
11:26:46
are too long so let's select them and then while we press shift we make them a
11:26:53
little bit shorter
11:27:04
okay now below the previews we will add a link that will take us to the work or
11:27:10
projects page for now let's uh just copy this shape and then place it
11:27:17
here can make it smaller and then Center
11:27:23
it now let's create a CTA right here and a CTA is basically a call to action we
11:27:30
will add something like let's create amazing things together or something like that okay so let's uh you know copy
11:27:38
one line here and then add it here in the center
11:27:45
we can make it shorter a little bit censor it and now we'll add the
11:27:54
footer the footer has to be very simple okay here um on the left side we will
11:28:01
add the copyright notice okay and also a link to our privacy policy page and then
11:28:07
on the right side we will add a link to the contact page let's add the footer Elements by making a copy of this we
11:28:15
place it right here this will be the copyright notice then we can make it
11:28:21
shorter then we make a copy this will be the link to our privacy policy page and
11:28:30
then we make another copy we place it here and this will be a link to our
11:28:35
contact page now let's reiz the frame a little bit like this all right so this is the
11:28:42
wireframe of the home hom page and obviously we may uh change the layout we may add some more stuff the purpose of
11:28:50
wireframes is so we can have an initial idea of where we want to place stuff so
11:28:55
this is not a final design okay things may change so this is the desktop version
11:29:01
now we'll create the tablet version and the mobile version in order to design the tablet
11:29:07
version in the mobile version we'll use two concepts responsive design and adaptive design and we already already
11:29:14
explored these Concepts in mael 3 so if you don't know what I'm talking about go back to model 3 Let's home 3.6 all right
11:29:21
now let's create the tablet version and to do so we click on the canvas and then we press F on our keyboard and then we
11:29:28
draw a frame now right here in the properties panel let's set the WID to 810
11:29:38
pixels now we change the background color to Black
11:29:45
and then we stretch the frame like this now let's change the name of this
11:29:52
Frame to homepage desktop Ware frame and then the
11:30:00
same naming convention for this one homepage
11:30:09
tet wi frame now let's start copying all these
11:30:15
elements here and we'll do them by sections so let's select this you know
11:30:22
the logo the menu and the intro text and then contrl C or command C then we
11:30:27
select this Frame and then control or command V now we'll move them a little bit to
11:30:34
the left and then we'll resize the width by
11:30:40
dragging right here now let's copy and paste
11:30:47
this right here then let's move it
11:30:55
here now we copy and paste the title here let's move it to the
11:31:03
center now let's select all the previews and the titles and then control or
11:31:09
command C and then we paste it here and now let's resize while pressing and
11:31:14
maintaining shift let's make the titles of the
11:31:21
preview a little be thicker so while we press and maintain shift we click on
11:31:26
this one and then on this one then we go to the properties panel and then we change the height to
11:31:35
six pixels and we do the same thing with
11:31:40
these ones
11:31:49
now let's select the footer and the CT then we copy select this
11:31:57
Frame and then paste now let's resize the width of the
11:32:02
elements so we can see them let's move them
11:32:10
up around here now let's resize the footer links a little
11:32:22
bit and also this something like
11:32:29
this then let's select this and move it
11:32:36
up and now let's select the frame and resize it like
11:32:42
this is you can see the layout is the same all right but we'll change the menu
11:32:47
because instead of having a full menu like in this case we'll have a link that will expand when we click okay so let's
11:32:55
make this smaller since it will be a link that will say
11:33:00
menu and now it's time to design the mobile wireframe so let's create the
11:33:06
frame by clicking on the canvas and then pressing F on our keyboard then let's draw the frame something like this for
11:33:13
now let's move it here now let's select the frame and then change the size here in
11:33:19
the properties panel to 390 and then let's change the background
11:33:26
color to Black now let's stretch it something like this for now and then let's change
11:33:34
the name to homepage
11:33:41
mobile wiame in terms of the names you don't have to use the exact same names
11:33:47
I'm using but make sure to name the frames now let's start adding the
11:33:52
elements here in the mobile version so we will do the same thing we did we copy
11:33:58
this and then paste it here move it a little bit to the
11:34:04
left then resize it something like this now let's select this move it up a
11:34:13
little little bit then stretch it because since we have less space in the
11:34:19
mobile version we should set it as full
11:34:24
width now let's resize this a little bit and then
11:34:35
this now let's copy and paste this we'll place it here for now
11:34:45
and then let's copy and paste the title replace it
11:34:51
here now let's resize the title to
11:34:57
60 then let's Center it and now when placing the previews
11:35:04
we'll use adaptive design it means that instead of displaying two columns we'll
11:35:09
display one and we do that because if not the images would look too small okay
11:35:15
and I already talked about adaptive design break points and responsive design in module 3 lesson 3.6 so check
11:35:23
it out again if you have to all right so let's select and copy
11:35:29
these two and then paste them here and then while they are selected let's press
11:35:34
alt on our keyboard and then copy them here and don't worry too much about the
11:35:40
spacing and all that stuff and the details because wireframes are not
11:35:45
supposed to be perfect okay just make sure that everything makes sense and that you understand the layout but
11:35:51
that's it sometimes people try to make very detailed and very like perfect wireframes and that defeats the purpose
11:35:58
because you could create a wireframe with pen and paper and that would still be valid and don't overthink too much
11:36:05
during this phase because in the next phase we'll start designing the final design and then some things may change
11:36:12
so don't worry about everything perfect now all right now let's continue with
11:36:17
the rest of the elements and we can just copy this button we select this Frame we
11:36:23
paste it we move it here around here and then we do the same
11:36:29
thing with
11:36:34
this we resize it something like this is
11:36:41
fine now let's add the menu item so we copy this and then we paste it
11:36:49
here here we have it then we we move it down and then this will be the copyright
11:36:58
notice all right then we make another copy and this will
11:37:04
be the privacy policy and
11:37:11
then this will be the contact
11:37:17
link all right so now we have the first WF frames the desktop version of the
11:37:22
homepage the tablet version and the mobile version all right so here is an exercise
11:37:29
for you as you can see I've completed all the wi frames here is the homepage then the work page the playground page
11:37:38
which is basically a page where you can add any creative projects you know or
11:37:43
any concept project you've uh made and this page is very important because it further shows your capabilities okay in
11:37:51
your creativity as well then we have the services page we
11:37:57
have the about page then the contact page and the privacy policy page and the exercise is
11:38:04
basically to replicate these pages okay replicate them because as they say
11:38:11
practice makes perfect and if you feel confident you can create your own version as well I will explain the um
11:38:17
fat process in a moment so you can have a better understanding of why I design the wireframes this way I will leave a
11:38:24
link uh in the description to a figma file containing the wireframes let's start with the homepage
11:38:30
the homepage is very simple here we have the logo which basically will be your name and last name here we have the
11:38:36
navigation menu and then here we have uh the introduction which will be basically
11:38:42
a description of who you are and what you do and it has to be written in a very compelling way okay because this
11:38:48
will be the the first piece of information people will uh read about you so you have to make sure it's
11:38:53
compelling here we replace your main Services okay and then here we have uh a
11:38:59
title for the content that follows here we will add your
11:39:04
availability and this is important because when people land in your portfolio they will quickly know if you
11:39:10
are available or not then here we have a CTA that will take people to your work
11:39:16
page like a c more button something like that and then here we'll have a link to
11:39:21
your contact page and then here we have the folder and here we have the uh tablet
11:39:29
version the mobile version and I've also added the menus so when we click this
11:39:34
link this menu will uh expand okay same thing here when we click this link this
11:39:39
menu will expand and now now this is the work page and it's very simple so basically we
11:39:46
have the title and then here we have the different previews and then when we click a preview we'll go to the projects
11:39:52
page and now I noticed that I forgot to create the projects page so I will do it
11:39:57
right now all right so here we have the projects page and here we will add the
11:40:03
content of each individual project okay so when people click on one of these
11:40:10
previews it will take them to the projects page and the project page is
11:40:16
very simple as you can see we have the title the description here we place the um you know the discipline for example
11:40:22
your xui or web design or branding or whatever and when people scroll they will they will see um the images okay of
11:40:29
the project and then here they will have AA that will take them to more projects
11:40:35
and then here AA to go to the uh contact page and the footer okay as you can see
11:40:43
here I like to use some wi space in some areas because I don't like to have everything aligned on one side I like to
11:40:50
play with the alignment now here we have the playground page and you can call it
11:40:56
playground or you can call it Concepts or experiments or whatever you want and
11:41:02
the design of this page is exactly the same as the work page all right here we
11:41:08
have the services page which is very simple as well and here we will list our services and here we will add some text
11:41:16
and a link to book a call now here we have the about page and
11:41:24
here we'll write our bio you know more in detail here we'll add some contact
11:41:31
info and here we can place an image of ourselves or an image of something we
11:41:37
identify with or we are inspired by or even a video okay explaining what we do
11:41:42
and here we can add some more information like our experience level like you know Junior designer senior
11:41:48
designer art director creative director stuff like that here we have the contact
11:41:54
page which also has your availability and it's important to add multiple forms
11:42:00
of contact like your email your phone number this can be you know your WhatsApp number or whatever and then a
11:42:07
link to book a call and here you can add some text like for example I reply
11:42:13
within 24 hours or something like that and here we have the privacy policy page which is basically a title and text all
11:42:20
right now it's time to start with the High Fidelity design and we'll start with the homepage
11:42:27
so we'll copy this Okay contrl C or command C if you
11:42:33
are on a Mac then go to this page and then paste it here let's move
11:42:41
it and as you can see see I have a mood board right here and I will go through
11:42:46
it right now you can create the mood board before um designing the wireframes
11:42:51
depending on if uh the mood board will have an impact on the layout okay but in
11:42:57
this case the mood board is going to be more about the Aesthetics and some layout as well but mainly Aesthetics and
11:43:04
as I said before the wireframes are not final so the layout can slightly change
11:43:10
during the half Fidelity design usually when I'm working on a real climent project I create the mood board right
11:43:16
after reading the brief but in this case since it's an example that represents my
11:43:22
own portfolio I have an idea of what I want and since I'm going to use the mood
11:43:27
board mainly for Aesthetics I create the mood board right before starting with the highi design it's basically a matter
11:43:34
of preference so I will go through the moodboard right now I will explain it very
11:43:39
briefly the aesthetic I'm going for is a moody dark mysterious and minimal
11:43:46
feel and that's why I added here this Lego Batmobile because for me it
11:43:52
represents mysteriousness and sophistication and the design of the bad
11:43:59
mobile is not minimal okay it's very complex very sophisticated and almost
11:44:06
the opposite of minimal and that's why I added these minimal Greek columns
11:44:13
and also these Zen Stones because I want to make sure that even though the design
11:44:20
will be somehow sophisticated because sometimes we will intentionally break
11:44:25
the monotony of the layout it should still be minimal and simple so some of
11:44:31
the images balance out the complexity of the bad mobile and that's why I added
11:44:38
some minimal images here I have here an image of a black stone because because I
11:44:43
will use a color that's similar to you know to this rxs color throughout the
11:44:48
design it's the graphite color and here I have more dark images
11:44:54
that will help me give the website that muty look and then I have some more dark
11:44:59
images here that will um you know inspire me to give the website that mysterious
11:45:05
look and this is a design from the Brown atellier series it's a beautiful design
11:45:12
and it was inspired by the design aesthetic of rams one of the best
11:45:17
designers of all time and what I like so much about the design of this device is
11:45:23
the clean and sharp lines and the overall aesthetic of it it's
11:45:28
beautiful here I'm using the images of a black Nike shoe designed by veril ablo
11:45:35
and the reason I'm using this uh images is because the website will feature some elements in Orange and I like the
11:45:42
contrast between black and orange and I will be also using some large font sizes
11:45:47
for the titles now let's begin with the high-fi
11:45:53
design I've quickly created this style guide and I'm not going to go into the details about style gu because I already
11:46:00
talk about it in module 3 lesson 3.8 but this will basically help me maintain
11:46:05
consistency throughout the entire design I will include this style guide inside of the figma file so that way you will
11:46:11
have access to it now that we have the style guide the next thing we have to do is create the color styles and you can
11:46:18
create the color styles by going here to the right side and then as you can see I already have the color styles created
11:46:25
but you can create the color styles by clicking this plus sign and then adding a name for the color and then the color
11:46:30
code and then you click on create style you can find the color code here in the
11:46:36
style guide okay in this case right here so you just have to click and then
11:46:42
select this code you copy it controll or command
11:46:48
C and then click on the canvas and then create
11:46:53
style you add a name and then here you paste the code okay and then create
11:47:02
style so these are all the colors we'll use throughout the entire design and in the case we want to add a new color
11:47:09
we'll do it by creating a new color style okay is I showed you so instead of using
11:47:16
color codes throughout the design we'll use color styles because this will make our design cleaner and more
11:47:23
organized the next thing we have to do is to create the text Styles and as you can see here in the style guide you can
11:47:30
see all the different uh text Styles okay and the process is the same you go
11:47:37
here and where it says local Styles you click the plus sign and then text
11:47:43
and then here you can add the information the name the type face the
11:47:50
font style the size and the line height and then create style okay let me show
11:47:57
you let's create the first uh Tex stle so as you can see here we'll separate
11:48:04
them by breakpoint so desktop tablet and mobile okay we'll start by creating the
11:48:09
title one for desktop so as you can see the phone size is 100 pixels and then
11:48:14
this 120 is the line height percentage and I talk about this percentage in
11:48:20
model 3 when I talk about the grid systems so what we have to do is again
11:48:26
click on the canvas and then go here where it says local style then click the plus sign and then text and then we add
11:48:33
the name in this case titles that's stop and then we already
11:48:38
know that theault family is enter okay it's what we have here in the style
11:48:46
guide then we'll keep it as regular and then here we will change the size to 100
11:48:51
pixels and then here we change it to 120% and then create style and now you
11:49:00
will see this tile right here all right so here are all the text
11:49:07
stes and there are many okay for tablet for mobile for
11:49:14
desktop and the thing is this task is a little bit tedious and it's very easy to
11:49:20
make mistakes so you have to double check them okay in order to make sure
11:49:27
that all the textiles are correct and there are better ways to do it though there are plugins to make these task
11:49:34
more efficient and I will teach you how to create color styles and tex stles more efficiently in the next module when
11:49:41
we go through advanced figma again mix and tools I wanted you to know how to create them manually first all right now
11:49:48
the last style we'll create is the grid style and we have all the information here in the style guide okay for the
11:49:56
different break points and we'll start with the desktop and the grid has to have 12
11:50:02
columns a 32 pixel Gutter and a margin of 40 pixels so
11:50:09
let's do the same thing we click on the canvas then we go to local Styles then we click
11:50:16
the plus sign and then this time we select great this will pop up and let's start with the desktop grid
11:50:24
so as a name we can name it desktop Gade and then we select
11:50:31
columns then we click on this icon right here to open the
11:50:36
settings and then 12 columns the color I will choose blue
11:50:42
because I like blue you can choose any other color the margin is 40 pixels and then
11:50:49
the gutter 32 and then we click on create style now you will see it
11:50:57
here now I created the other two grides for tablet and mobile right and we can
11:51:04
start with the design now let's create a frame right here so
11:51:10
we click on the canvas and then we press press F on our keyboard and then we draw a frame something like this then while
11:51:18
the frame is selected we go to the proper spanel right here and then we write 14
11:51:24
40 now we have our desktop frame in the proper size now the next thing we'll do
11:51:30
is to rename this Frame so we double click here and then we
11:51:35
write homepage something like this and now while we have this Frame selected we go
11:51:42
go to the properties panel right here then we click then we go to libraries
11:51:47
and then we select black let's say background color now let's create the
11:51:53
header but before we create the header we have to assign a grid to this Frame
11:51:59
and to do so we select this Frame and then here in the properties panel we click these four dots okay and then we
11:52:05
click on desktop grid now we can barely see the grid
11:52:12
because we have a black background and then the uh Grid's transparency is set
11:52:17
to 10% I believe so we have to change that if instead of black we had a white
11:52:25
background we could see the grd right but it's not the case because the
11:52:31
background is black and we can fix that by going to the properties panel right here and then we click here and then
11:52:38
edit style and then here and here in the color option we see this
11:52:46
percentage which is the transparency or opacity then we have to click and then
11:52:51
increase it to maybe 30% and now we'll see it maybe 30% is too much so let's
11:52:58
set it to 20 now it looks good we can see
11:53:05
it if you still want to increase the uh grid visibility you can do so by
11:53:10
selecting the frame and then then here in the properties panel we addit the
11:53:15
desktop grid by clicking here and then here and we change the color to a
11:53:23
lighter Hue something like like this
11:53:29
maybe and now you can see the grid more clearly and if we change the background
11:53:36
color to white we can still see the great all right
11:53:44
let's change the background color back to black and let's proceed to create the
11:53:49
header this is the section we'll create all right and remember that the final
11:53:55
design will not be exactly the same as the wi frames the wi frames are just like a guide a reference okay so while
11:54:03
we have this Frame selected we press F on our keyboard and then we draw a frame
11:54:08
right here and now we go to the properties panel and where it says stroke we click and then we change the
11:54:14
color to white and then the thickness to three and this is just a temporary
11:54:22
stroke so we can you know we can see the frame as you will notice I will not be
11:54:27
naming the layers and the frames one by one manually because figma now has an AI tool to name multiple layers
11:54:34
automatically so we'll use that now let's create the items that we
11:54:39
leave inside of this header so let's select this Frame and then while we have this Frame selected
11:54:46
we press t on our keyboard then we click and then you write your name in my
11:54:51
case your last name as well obviously this is very small now because the
11:54:57
default phone size is 12 so let's go to the properties panel and then change the font size instead of changing the font
11:55:04
size directly here we click these four dots and then remember that we created the text Styles so let's select the
11:55:10
medium text okay this one now we can see it let's move it here
11:55:18
for now then let's select the frame again and then press T click and now
11:55:24
we'll write menu item let's go to the Wi frames and
11:55:30
components page to see how many menu items you have to create so we have the
11:55:37
work page and then the playground that's to
11:55:43
Services three about page four and then contact let's go back to the design page
11:55:51
so we need five menu items so let's select this one and then while we press alt we drag
11:55:58
and make a copy then another copy and two more now we have all five let's change
11:56:06
the names work then then okay
11:56:15
round Services
11:56:22
about new
11:56:28
contact we can deactivate the grid for now by pressing shift on our keyboard and then
11:56:35
J now let's add all these menu items inside of a individual Auto layout frames so let's select the individually
11:56:43
and then press shift a on our keyboard and we'll do the same thing with all
11:56:50
these and this one as well the
11:56:56
logo and now we'll select all these
11:57:01
frames by pressing a maintaining shift and then let's press shift a to create
11:57:06
another order layout frame
11:57:12
now let's add a temporary stroke to this Frame so let's double click and then here in the property
11:57:19
spanel we click where it says stroke then we change it to White and then
11:57:29
three and now we can better distinguish the frames now the next thing we have to do
11:57:36
is Select this Frame the hether frame and press shift a on our keyboard and
11:57:42
now we have an order layout frame the next thing is to select the
11:57:47
navigation frame then here in the property spanel right here we will uh
11:57:53
edit the padding it's set to Zero by default but we will change it to 30 and
11:57:58
we want to apply the padding on all sides and to do so we press control on
11:58:04
our keyboard and then we click and now we can add the padding 30
11:58:09
pixels in this case and that's it now it added a 30 pixel padding on all
11:58:17
sides now let me ask you something did I add the proper padding you know the 30
11:58:23
pixels the answer is no because we are using the 8 point grid
11:58:30
system and the padding has to be a multiple of eight in this case we can
11:58:36
choose uh 24 pixels or 32 pixels so let's select the navigation
11:58:42
frame again we double click then here in the properties panel we press control
11:58:48
then click and then we write 32 then we press enter now the navigation frame is set to
11:58:55
32 pixels respecting the 8o grid system now when I select this uh header
11:59:02
frame you will see that it's h set to uh 36 pixels okay it can be a different
11:59:08
number but it doesn't matter because we have to set it to zero so we we press control and then we click and then we
11:59:14
write zero it should look like this before we continue I want to men
11:59:21
sure something when I select this Frame I can see here in the properties panel
11:59:26
that there is a color code okay and this was an oversight but it doesn't matter
11:59:31
because it's very easy to fix we just have to click these four dots and then
11:59:36
select the color white and that's it now it's much cleaner
11:59:44
don't worry too much about oversights because it happens we are human right and when we design a website through
11:59:50
figma there are so many moving pieces so oversights can happen but don't worry
11:59:55
though because in the next module I will show you a uh system that I use right before finishing the website to make
12:00:01
sure everything is in order now let's add a background color to the navigation menu so this
12:00:08
Frame and I will add a very dark color the because I want it to be very sub
12:00:13
barely noticeable it's just like a small detail so here in the properties panel we click where it says fill and then we
12:00:20
select the dark graphite color and now the navigation menu has a
12:00:27
very SLE background color now we can remove The Strokes in
12:00:33
these two frames so we select this Frame and then here in the properties panel we remove The Stroke by clicking here
12:00:42
and we do the same thing with this
12:00:49
Frame and now we are starting to get that Batman or feel you know like the
12:00:54
graphite um I mean the dark graphite color in the navigation menu against the
12:00:59
black background gives us that mysterious feel now let's add a Sol
12:01:05
Corner radius because you know the sharp angles makes the menu look a little
12:01:11
unpolished so I want to add a Sol Corner radio so we click then we go here in the
12:01:18
properties panel where it says appearance and we will add a corner radius of six
12:01:25
maybe and now it looks a little better right it's
12:01:30
barely uh noticeable but this small uh details Scout now we rename the layers using a
12:01:38
cool AI feature all right so to do it let's select the main frame so we have
12:01:45
all the layers selected all right and then here at the
12:01:50
bottom we click this icon right here and then we click on rename
12:01:56
layers and as you can see it will start renaming the layers automatically we
12:02:02
have to wait a little bit now
12:02:08
awesome now since we know that this header will be repeated throughout the uh you know the entire portfolio we
12:02:13
should create a component I already talk about components in depth in module 3 but components basically um work this
12:02:21
way so when you have a component and then you make a change to that component all the instances that are linked to
12:02:28
that component also change let's say you have 10 pages and then you don't have components if you
12:02:35
want to change uh you know or add a menu item you would have to do it in all the
12:02:40
pages individually but if you have a component you only have to edit the
12:02:46
component so let's first go to the uh W frames and components page right here
12:02:52
and then right here let's create a
12:02:58
frame and here we will add our
12:03:07
components what I like to do is to resize these uh component frame to the same size as the break point I'm working
12:03:15
with for example let's go right now to the design page so I can show you when I
12:03:20
select this Frame I can see that it's 1440 right so
12:03:28
I like to also resize this to
12:03:36
1440 and I do this because I will also apply the grid to this frame in in order
12:03:42
to control the size of the elements so let's do that right now while we have this Frame selected we go here in the
12:03:48
properties panel and then we click these four dots and then we apply the desktop
12:03:53
grid now let's go back to the design page and then we select this Frame we
12:04:01
press contrl C or command C on our keyboard then we go to the Y frames and components
12:04:06
page and then while we have this Frame selected we paste
12:04:13
the frame here now let's select this Frame again
12:04:19
and then in the properties panel we change the background color to
12:04:25
Black let's press shift plus G to hide the grid for now and then we select this
12:04:30
Frame we right click and then we click on create component and now as you can
12:04:36
see the selection outline turns purple because this is a component now
12:04:45
now while we have this Frame selected we press contrl C then we go back to the
12:04:50
design page and then we remove uh this Frame
12:04:55
then we select this Frame and then paste the component and now this is not a
12:05:01
component okay this is an instance of the component so let me show you we have now
12:05:07
two pages the H page and then the services page and they both have the same instance okay so if I go to the
12:05:15
wireframes and components page and then I change the background color of the navigation
12:05:22
menu let's change it to this orange it also
12:05:29
changes in both Pages all right so it's very efficient and this I
12:05:35
said I explained this in detail in modle 3 so go back and watch it if you still don't know how it works now let's go
12:05:41
back to the Wi frames and components page and then let's change the color
12:05:48
again to dark graphite and now let's select this
12:05:54
component and then rename it so we know this is the desktop
12:06:01
version and now we have all the pages inside of the navigation menu and we'll
12:06:06
create a button right next to it and that button will be a call to action for for people to book a call to create the
12:06:14
button we'll basically select the uh navigation frame this one and then we'll
12:06:19
press alt and then drag outside of the frame to make a copy and then we'll double click on playground and then
12:06:25
while we press shift we select all these and then we'll delete them and now here
12:06:30
we have the button now we can simply press control double click and then
12:06:36
write book a call now here we have half the button
12:06:43
now we'll press control and then click on Bou a code then we go to the properties panel and then we change the
12:06:49
color to Black then we select the
12:06:55
button then we go to the property panel again and then we change the background color to
12:07:03
white and the next thing we have to do is to move this button inside of this
12:07:09
Frame now we select the navigation frame and
12:07:14
then we press shift we select this Frame as well this button and then we press shift a to create a new order layout
12:07:21
frame containing these two um frames the navigation menu and the button and then here in the properties panel we'll
12:07:28
change this space to 32 pixels which is this Gap right
12:07:36
here now let's click here multiple times and we select this Frame okay the
12:07:41
navigation um container and then here in the properties panel we have to change this to 48 pixels so it's a multiple of
12:07:50
eight now let's select the Heather and then let's click on this icon and then
12:07:56
rename
12:08:03
layers now let's go back to the design page and let's create the next section
12:08:11
so here we have the copy I will use for the homepage and as you can see it's very
12:08:17
simple and to the point still I'm being very meticulous with the message as you
12:08:22
can see we have the opening statement the service description plus the target market and then the value
12:08:30
proposition and in terms of the niche I selected these three because they are related so
12:08:38
basically if you work with a luxury real estate firm they can refer you to an interior design or Architecture Firm
12:08:45
right and the services I'm going to offer to all of them are very similar so
12:08:50
choosing niches that are related is a smart move all right so let's go back to
12:08:55
the design file and then we click inside of this Frame and let's create a frame you press F and then we draw something
12:09:02
like this now we select the frame and then we add a stroke right
12:09:09
here say it wide and then three now I will go back to the document
12:09:17
and then I will copy this I will create a frame right here to host the text for a second I will move
12:09:24
it here let's resize it
12:09:32
first now instead of just copying and pasting it here I will place the first
12:09:38
line on the left side and then the rest on the right side side and I will do
12:09:43
this because this first line is powerful and we tend to read first what's on our
12:09:48
left and then move to the right and that's called the F or Z pattern especially for uh languages that read
12:09:56
left to right now let's select and copy this line and then we paste it inside of
12:10:03
this Frame then while we have it selected we go to the properties panel and then we
12:10:09
change the color to white so we can see it now we'll select this Frame and then
12:10:16
activate Auto layout shift plus a and then we'll select the text and then shift plus a as
12:10:24
well now let's do the same thing with uh this paragraph So we select it and then
12:10:30
we copy it then we select this Frame we paste it here and then while we have the
12:10:37
text selected we go to the properties panel and then we change the color to y so we can see it and now while we have
12:10:44
this text selected we press shift a now it's an aut layout frame now let's
12:10:50
change this frames padding so whatever padding you have here you have to set it to zero so let's select this Frame and
12:10:57
then here in the properties panel we press control then we click then we write
12:11:04
zero all right should look like this now now let's show the grid and and then
12:11:11
let's resize this Frame like this we can hide the grid
12:11:17
now now we select this Frame again then we go to the properties panel right here
12:11:24
and then we select this alignment top Center and now we double click and it will look like this
12:11:34
now okay and now we can remove this stroke
12:11:43
for this section we will not create a component because we'll only use it here in the homepage now let's remove this and then
12:11:51
let's select this paragraph in this line so we press and maintain control then we
12:11:57
click now while we have control pressed we press shift on our keyboard and then
12:12:02
we click here and now we can release the keys and then go
12:12:08
here and then select large
12:12:14
text now let's select this Frame by double clicking this one and then we go to the
12:12:20
properties panel and we set it to hug
12:12:25
content now we double click again to select the text and then we set it to
12:12:31
hug contents as well now it should look like
12:12:37
this let's double click here to select this Frame and then we press shift plus G to show the grid and now we resize
12:12:45
this Frame so it aligns with the grid right
12:12:51
here now that the column grid is visible I want to mention something here in the navigation menu as you can see the
12:13:00
container doesn't align perfectly with the grid and that's okay that's intentional because we are letting Oro
12:13:07
do its job and all the spacing and padding is are respecting the 8po grid
12:13:12
system and that's what really matters now I will make sure that everything looks
12:13:18
nice okay I notice here that we should remove the padding
12:13:23
on the sides all right so we go to the components page and then we select this
12:13:31
Frame and then here in the properties panel we set it to
12:13:36
zero and now it's align
12:13:42
we can hide the grid for now I may change the um alignment of this paragraph later but for now I will keep
12:13:50
it like this when I add the rest of the content I will zoom out and see if I have to change
12:13:56
something let's quickly check the WF frame again now we'll add the services and
12:14:03
then the title for the content below and then the availability so let's do it
12:14:13
let's click on this Frame then we add a frame by pressing F on our keyboard and
12:14:18
then we draw something like this then we do the same thing in the properties panel we add a stroke we set it to
12:14:28
White and then three now let's show the
12:14:35
grid and then let's stretch this
12:14:43
let's hide the grid [Music] now now let's click inside of this Frame
12:14:48
and then we add a [Music]
12:15:00
frame this Frame will contain the services then we make a copy of this
12:15:06
Frame this will contain the title and then we make another copy
12:15:12
this will contain the availability and now we select this
12:15:18
frame on the left and we'll press t on our keyboard and we will click and then write our first service which is web
12:15:28
design now we'll change this uh font size to small and see how it looks so
12:15:34
here in the properties panel while we have the text selected we change it to small text
12:15:44
and now let's make a copy and then we can
12:15:50
write branding and now we make another copy and we write
12:16:01
Consulting and now we'll select each of them individually and we will activate all layout shift plus a
12:16:16
now we'll select this Frame and then shift plus a to activate
12:16:21
all layout and now while we have the frame selected we go here in the properties panel and here we press and
12:16:29
maintain control on our keyboard and then we click and then we set this to zero now we make sure that all these are
12:16:36
set to hug hug so we have to change this one
12:16:42
all right now let's select these frames while we press and Main shift to select
12:16:49
them all and then we go here in the properties panel then we press and
12:16:55
maintain control then we click and then we set this to zero because we don't want any
12:17:03
padding now let's select this Frame and then let's go back to the properties panel and then let's set this
12:17:10
spacing in between items to eight pixels like
12:17:19
this and then we set the WID to hug here in the properties
12:17:29
panel now let's create the title which will be inside of this Frame so let's
12:17:34
select this Frame and then we press t on our keyboard and then we write work now
12:17:40
let's go to the properties panel and then we change the Tex size to
12:17:48

12:18:39
zero now let's add the availability right here so let's copy one of
12:18:46
these and then we select this Frame and then we paste it and then here we'll
12:18:53

stroke now let's go back to the Wi
12:20:57
frames and this is the section we'll create now the project
12:21:03
previews and to do so we go to the Wi frames and components page right here
12:21:08
and then we show the grid and now we click and then we press r on our keyboard and then we press and
12:21:15
maintain shift and then we drag to draw a square now let's move it here for
12:21:23
now now since we have 12 columns let's resize this Square so it covers six
12:21:29
columns one 2 3 four five and six all right so let's select it and then let's
12:21:35
press and maintain shift to keep the aspect ratio and then let's resize it right here
12:21:43
now we will hide the grid and then right here below the square we will add um some text so we press t on our keyboard
12:21:50
and then we click and then we write project title and
12:21:57
then you can use an M Dash or a hyphen all right or a comma if you
12:22:04
want that's up to you now we select the text and then here in the prop panel we
12:22:11
change the size to medium now while it's selected let's
12:22:16
press shift a to activate Auto layout let's do the same thing with the
12:22:23

12:22:32
both and now let's select them and then press shift
12:22:38
a now let's show the grid and then let's move this to make sure
12:22:44
it's properly aligned and now we can hide the grid
12:22:49
again now let's select this Frame and then let's rename it right here we can rename
12:22:55
IT project preview card let
12:23:02
startop and now we can use this option while we have the frame selected to
12:23:07
rename the rest of the layers
12:23:15
and now let's turn this into a component so we right click and then we click here
12:23:20
where it says create component now I will change the color of
12:23:26
this Square you can leave it as it is but I prefer to change it to
12:23:34
graphite now let's make sure this card is uh responsive because now if we uh
12:23:40
Rec it nothing happens right so let's select the image
12:23:47
okay and then we go here in the properties panel and then we set it to fi container and then fi container so
12:23:54
the width and the height are set to fi
12:23:59
container and now we do the same thing with the image container so we select this
12:24:05
layer and then here we make sure the height is also set to fill container
12:24:11
and now when we try to resize um this card this happens right it's
12:24:19
responsive now let's select and copy this component so contrl C and then we
12:24:24
go to the design page we select this Frame and then we
12:24:30
paste it here now let's show the grid and then let's align this right here for
12:24:38
now now let's select this instance and let's make three
12:24:44
copies two and then three perfect now let's select these four
12:24:50
instances and then press shift a to create an a layout frame now we have to make sure that this
12:24:58
space and then this space are multiples of eight because we are using the eight point grid system and upon looking at
12:25:06
this space I can see that it's a 33 pixel and it should be 32 pixels so let's go
12:25:14
back to the component and see what happened now let's show the grid then let's select the
12:25:21
component and then I will Zoom to see pixel by pixel and now I can see
12:25:28
that it's a one pixel short so I will press and maintain shift and then resize
12:25:38
it let's hide the GRE read then go to the design
12:25:45
page now let's go to the properties panel and let's change this to 32
12:25:53
pixels the reason why we are seeing this instances like this it's because this
12:25:58
Frame is one pixel short so let's activate the
12:26:04
grid and then I will show you what I mean
12:26:14
all right as you can see it's one pixel short so let's press shift and maintain
12:26:19
shift and then we resize
12:26:27
it now it looks good and I just show you the beauty of
12:26:34
using components because we saw an error right and then we went to the component
12:26:39
and then we fix the error on all the instances simultaneously now while we have this
12:26:46
Frame selected the frame containing the instances we go here and then we change this to hug
12:26:55
contents now let's change this spacing to 56 pixels multiple of
12:27:07
eight now let's go back to the component
12:27:12
and then let's change this space to 32
12:27:21
pixels and then let's go back to the design
12:27:26
page and now it's time to add the images here and what I like to do is to show a
12:27:33
mockup if you are wondering what a mockup is a mockup is basically a visual representation of a design concept cep
12:27:40
and here for example we can see a part of a website displayed on an
12:27:46
iPad and here we have this hero section of a website displayed on a MacBook
12:27:52
mockups enhance your designs by displaying them in a real world context there are many websites where you can
12:27:58
download mockups for free and you can also buy premium mockups if you need something more specific usually premium
12:28:04
mockups are better quality and also more exclusive I will leave a link in
12:28:10
description that will give you access to a list um where you will find a bunch of different websites where you can
12:28:16
download mockups for free and you will also find a list of websites to buy premium
12:28:22
mockups after you download a mockup you will see a PSD file and if you have
12:28:27
Photoshop installed when you double click the mockup will open inside of
12:28:32
Photoshop so after the mockup is open here on the right side you will see a
12:28:37
bunch of different layers and usually you will see a layer that says um your design here or a placeholder or
12:28:44
something like that right and this is the layer you will edit so after you identify the layer you
12:28:52
have to edit you just have to double click and then this new tab will
12:28:57
open now you can hide these uh two layers by clicking on this I icon and
12:29:04
then here at the bottom you click on this plus sign to create a new layer
12:29:10
and now you can see the new layer here now you will see this empty and here is
12:29:15
where we will place our design so here is a design I created as an example and I will use it for the maup and to do so
12:29:23
I will select this Frame and then right click and then I'll select here where it says copy or paste as and then copy as
12:29:30
PNG and then I click and then here I will wait until it says copy this
12:29:38
PNG and now with Photoshop open I will paste it right here and now while this
12:29:44
layer is selected all right I will go where it says edit right here and then I
12:29:49
will click on free transform and now I will resize this so
12:29:56
it fits the frame and here on Photoshop you don't
12:30:01
have to press and maintain shift to keep the aspect ratio now if I go to this tab
12:30:07
containing the mockup this is what I see but then if I go back to this tab and
12:30:14
then I save this by pressing contrl s on my keyboard and then I go back to the
12:30:20
mockup perfectly placed on mockup sometimes you can also change the background color for example in this
12:30:27
case here in the layers panel if I double click here this window will
12:30:33
open and then I can change the color all right to whatever I want
12:30:46
and then what I like to do is that since this are squares I will also save the mockup inside of a square okay I will
12:30:52
add it to a square and then save the file that way when I uh import the image
12:30:57
right here it will fit perfectly let me show you what I mean I will go to the component first then I
12:31:05
will select the image and then here in the proper spanel I can see that it's not perfect square but almost right so I
12:31:13
will use this size this width and this height to create a new image on
12:31:20
Photoshop so here in Photoshop I will create a new file so I will click here
12:31:25
where it says file and then new and this will pop
12:31:31
up here we have to make sure that this is set to pixels and then we'll add the
12:31:37
width which is 664 four and then the height which is
12:31:44
680 and then we'll click on okay now we have here the square now
12:31:52
we'll resize this so the image has a larger resolution and to do so we go here where it says image we click then
12:31:59
we click on image size this will pop up then we click on
12:32:05
this icon right here to maintain the aspect ratio and then we'll resize this to 12 100 pixels and then we click on
12:32:14
okay now let's go back to the mockup tab and then I will change this
12:32:19
background color so it's exactly the same as the graphite color we are using to design our website so here inside of
12:32:26
figma I will go to the properties panel and then I will select the graphite color and then I will click here and
12:32:33
then I will copy the colar code now back in photo sh I will go to
12:32:40
the layers panel right here and then I will double click here now this window will pop up and
12:32:48
then I will paste the color code I just copy it here and then I will click on
12:32:54
okay and now the background color is applied and it's just a little bit lighter than what we had right we had
12:33:02
this color okay and then we change it to this color now let's go to the layers panel
12:33:09
and then let's write click on any of the layers this one for example and then let's click on merge
12:33:17
visible now let's press contrl a to select the entire image and then control
12:33:23
or command C to copy it now we go to this tab containing the file we previously
12:33:30
created and then we press control or command V to paste it right here now
12:33:36
let's make sure we have the image selected so here in the layer spanel we click
12:33:43
once and then we go to edit and we click on free
12:33:51
transform and now let's resize it all right and make sure to not press and
12:33:57
maintain shift because unlike uh figma you don't have to do that on Photoshop
12:34:03
can place it somewhere like here for example looks good
12:34:10
and then we press enter now let's save our image and to do
12:34:16
so we'll go to file and then instead of save as we go to export okay because
12:34:23
we'll optimize the image first now click on export
12:34:28
as and this window will pop up and here we can see the file size right here all
12:34:35
right and then if the file size was like 1 Megabyte for example that will be too
12:34:41
large so here when it says file settings we would adjust the uh quality of the
12:34:47
image in order to get a more efficient file size so if the file size is too
12:34:52
large we would have to compromise on quality but this image is
12:34:57
271.50 pixels so it's fine you should always aim for images that are under 500
12:35:05
kiloby if you need to display an image that's very large you you can go up to
12:35:11
900 kilobytes because sometimes you can't compromise on quality okay but try
12:35:16
to keep most images below 500 kilobytes okay so now the next thing is
12:35:22
to click on export right here and then I will change the name to
12:35:29
something like something like
12:35:35
this and then save
12:35:42
all right so now here in figma we'll add the image right here so let's click until the square um is selected make
12:35:49
sure you select this layer okay this one and now here in the properties panel
12:35:57
where it says fill it says graphite right we click on this color and then we
12:36:03
click on custom and then we click on this uh image icon and then we click on
12:36:08
upload from computer Now navigate to the folder that contains
12:36:13
the image and then double click now we can see the image right
12:36:25
here I followed the same process and added these other
12:36:31
projects and then I also added the titles
12:36:36
okay and as you can see not all of them have to have the same background color
12:36:41
all right I mix it up a little bit and I use mockups right and I use screenshots
12:36:47
I use photos so feel free to mix it up now it's time to create the CTA that
12:36:53
will take users to the work page and to create it we'll click inside of the frame and then we'll press t on
12:37:00
our keyboard we'll click again and then let's write
12:37:05
more projects now while we have the text selected we
12:37:12
go to the properties panel and then we change the text size to CTA
12:37:18
text now we keep the text selected and then we press shift a to activate or
12:37:25
layout now let's double click to select the text and then let's apply the color
12:37:34
style now let's add this arrow and you will find a link in the description
12:37:40
that will take you to a folder with all the assets the images the icons and all that so let's drag the arrow
12:37:48
here now let's select this Frame the frame containing the arrow and then here in the properties panel we activate this
12:37:55
so we click in order to maintain the aspect ratio and then let's resize it to
12:38:00
40 pixels and now let's move it inside of this
12:38:07
Frame now I will select the frame and then here in the properties panel I will
12:38:13
change the space into 24 pixels and now while we have this Frame
12:38:21
selected we'll uh press and maintain shift and then select this Frame and then we'll activate all
12:38:29
layout and then here in the properties panel we change this to
12:38:36
120 remember that we are using the a Point grid system so make sure that the spacing is always set to a multiple of
12:38:46
eight now while we have this Frame selected we select this Frame while we maintain and I mean press and maintain
12:38:52
shift and then we activate Auto layout and we'll set this spacing also
12:38:58
to 120
12:39:06
pixels now the next step is to design sign the footer let's go to the wireframe to
12:39:13
check the layout okay so we have three items and this was basically a uh CTA
12:39:22
for people to book a call but since we already added the button in the menu we don't have to add
12:39:30
it here now let's create a frame something like this and while we have
12:39:37
this Frame selected let's press t on our keyword and then let's write
12:39:42
copyright then we make a copy and then we
12:39:48
write privacy policy and then we make another copy and then write
12:39:54
contact now let's select them all and then let's change the text size to
12:40:00
medium text now let's select the copyright and
12:40:06
then the privacy policy and then let's activate or layout here we have to apply the same
12:40:12
spacing we use in the navigation menu so let's
12:40:18
check it's um 48 pixels all right so let's select this
12:40:26
Frame and then in the properties panel we set this to 48
12:40:32
pixels and now while we have this selected we go to the properties panel again and then we change this to hug
12:40:40
contents now let's select the contact and then let's activate aut
12:40:46
layout and then while we have this uh selected we go to the properties panel
12:40:51
and we have to make sure that uh the padding is set to
12:40:57
zero now while we have uh this Frame selected let's select this Frame as well
12:41:02
and then let's activate aut layout now let's select the container and then we activate aut
12:41:09
layout as well let's stretch it now here in the properties panel
12:41:16
change the horizontal padding to 0er pixels and then the vertical padding whatever padding you have here change it
12:41:23
to 40 pixels and now we have a proper alignment and
12:41:29
spacing now let's add a three pixel border to the top of this Frame so let's go to the properties panel here where it
12:41:35
says stroke and then let's click and then let's select the white color let's set it to three
12:41:43
pixels and then here in this Square we click and then we select tab and now we
12:41:49
can see it here it's a very simple footer but this is how I like it I don't like to add too much stuff in here I
12:41:56
like to keep it very minimal now let's select this Frame and then let's rename
12:42:01
the remaining layers
12:42:11
now let's select the footer and then we press and maintain shift and we select this Frame as well
12:42:16
and then we activate Auto layout now we go to the property spanner and then we
12:42:22
change the spacing to 200 pixels now while we have this Frame
12:42:28
selected we select this Frame as well and then we activate Auto layout then we go here to the properties panel and then
12:42:35
we change this to 176 pixels which is a multi of
12:42:40
eight now while we have this Frame selected we select the header as well and then we activate Auto
12:42:47
layout then we go to the properties panel and then whatever um spacing you have here set it to 144
12:42:55
pixels now let's select this Frame again and then let's activate Auto layout we go to the properties panel and
12:43:03
then we press and maintain control we click and then we set it to 40 pixels
12:43:10
now we have a padding of 40 pixels on all
12:43:15
sides there is something that doesn't convince me too much about this um this
12:43:22
area right here because since we are using um one
12:43:28
frame on each side and they have different widths the title is not
12:43:34
centered so what I will do is to select this frame and then move it here and
12:43:41
then while I have this selected I select this and then activate Auto
12:43:50
layout and now in the properties panel we change this to this Arrow vertical layout now it's displayed like
12:44:00
this now let's set it to fi container I mean the height to fi container right
12:44:07
and then double click here to add automatic spacing now it's perfectly
12:44:19
aligned now let's select this um frame the title all right and then we press
12:44:25
the left arrow on our keyboard once so now we have the homepage almost
12:44:33
completed we just have to create the rest of the components and the rest of
12:44:38
the components will basically be the CTA and the footer so let's select and copy
12:44:46
both and then paste them inside of the wi frames and components
12:44:57
page right here
12:45:09
now let's convert them into components now let's copy the CTA and
12:45:16
then we go to the design page again and then we select this Frame and
12:45:22
then we paste the
12:45:28
CTA now let's remove the
12:45:33
footer then we go to the W frames and components page we select this component then we
12:45:41
copy it we go back to the design
12:45:46
page then we select this Frame and then we paste it right
12:45:56
here now let's go back to the Wi frames and components page and then let's make
12:46:02
sure we rename the uh components correctly so here in the layest panel we
12:46:08
change the name to footer desktop and
12:46:15
then CTA
12:46:20
desktop then let's change the default text for the CTA now we just have to change the text
12:46:28
here in the
12:46:33
homepage and that's it now we have the homepage completed
12:46:39
and the next step is to create the tablet version then the mobile version and then all the other
12:46:45
Pages now let's select this Frame again and then
12:46:50
here we click on rename layers to make sure that all remaining layers are named
12:47:00
correctly all right so app designed all the pages and as you can see we have the dark mode right here and then the light
12:47:07
mode right here here we have the homepage designed for
12:47:13
desktop for tablet and then for mobile and then here we have the work
12:47:20
page all right then here we have the project page and as you can see here
12:47:27
it's very important to also add a link to the figma file and this is important
12:47:33
because sometimes clients for example if you are working with an agency or with a company they want to see how U you know
12:47:40
your file is structured and giving them access through your portfolio makes
12:47:45
things way easier here I like to add a little
12:47:52
description about the project and it has to be brief because this is not a case study okay and then here we have all the
12:48:02
images I like to add three or four Images maximum but sometimes if the
12:48:07
project is like a large project I add more but then I have this animation
12:48:13
loading more images as we scroll and I created this uh animation just for
12:48:18
reference right because we'll only use it if we add like very large files that take longer to load so we probably won't
12:48:26
be using it for this design here I have the playground page here I basically add um you know
12:48:33
different projects and Concepts and stuff that are not directly related to web design
12:48:39
and as you can see I use a totally different background color to completely visually break from my uh web design
12:48:47
work sections all right you know the playground is
12:48:53
supposed to be fun you know different and that's why I intentionally change the colors so here's an example this is
12:49:00
a media control device that I design and it's intended to be a physical product
12:49:06
so it has nothing to do with web design and then here we have the about page
12:49:12
which combines uh you know a brief bio and then the services as you can see I combine them
12:49:20
and I remove the services menu item since it's not longer necessary here I
12:49:25
have some contact information and it's important to uh you know use WhatsApp nowadays because a lot of people use
12:49:32
WhatsApp especially in Europe but um in the US back in the days almost no one used WhatsApp but now now people is
12:49:39
using it um a lot so make sure to also use WhatsApp here as I said we have the
12:49:46
services okay all the services and then here I like to add
12:49:52
also a photo it can be a photo of you or a photo of something that inspires you
12:49:57
or whatever just make sure that it's high quality and in this page you can also
12:50:03
add all your Social Links here we have the contact page which is very very
12:50:08
simple all right you just have here all the ways people can contact you all right never forget WhatsApp and then a
12:50:15
link so people can book a strategy session and don't worry about it because in module 12 I will show you how to set
12:50:22
it up and never forget to tell people how long will it take for you to reply
12:50:27
to them you know it has to be approximate but always get back to people within 24 or 48 Hours maximum and
12:50:34
then here we have the privacy policy page very simple the title and then the text I will give you access to this
12:50:41
Sigma file you can uh find the link in the description so you can see everything in more detail and remember
12:50:47
you don't have to copy everything that I do all right do everything your way but then take into consideration my way of
12:50:54
thinking and then the technical aspects and all that because if all of you design the same way like the same
12:51:00
portfolio it may not be as effective all right you have to add your only unique
12:51:05
personality and now it's time to start developing in the website using framer all right so if you don't have a
12:51:12
framer account go to framer dcom and then here on the top right
12:51:18
click on sign up now here you can choose to continue with Google or continue with a different
12:51:25
email service if you want I will continue with Google I already signed it into my
12:51:31
Google account but you like if you haven't you'll probably see a screen
12:51:37
where you can choose your Google account all right and then after that you will see this
12:51:42
page here you have to add your last name in my case and then check this box and
12:51:48
then continue and then you will be taken inside of your framer account the first thing I want you to do is to install the
12:51:55
desktop app and to do so here on the right side you will see this option where it says get a desktop app and all
12:52:01
you have to do is click on install you'll be taken to this
12:52:06
page now click on download for Mac or download for
12:52:12
Windows for me it's windows and then once you download the app install it on
12:52:17
your computer so after installing opening the app and entering your credentials you will see this page and
12:52:24
this is basically your dashboard all right so all your projects all your websites will be placed
12:52:31
here here on the top left you will see uh this option right and then when you
12:52:36
click you will see um you know your workspace right where it says my workspace that's uh the workspace you
12:52:42
are in so this okay and then whenever you are working with a real client you
12:52:49
can create a workspace for them so when you click here you will um see this
12:52:54
popup and then here you can add the workspace name and all that and then when you create it your client will have
12:53:00
access to this workspace okay you get the client access and then they can handle um the billing but then you can
12:53:06
be in charge of the maintenance all right right and if your client wants um full ownership of the uh of the entire
12:53:14
project you can transfer it to them that basically depends on the agreement between you and your client here you
12:53:20
have also the option to change it to dark mode right where it says night mode and here you have access to other
12:53:28
sections so feel free to explore them whenever you want to invite a new
12:53:33
member you can do so by clicking here and you can also create a new project by clicking
12:53:41
here to access all the main options offered by framer you have to upgrade to a paid account and to do so you click on
12:53:48
this icon right here and then this will pop up now go to plans right
12:53:57
here and then upgrade and here you will see all the
12:54:03
plans you can pay early but since you are just starting out you can also total
12:54:09
this off and then pay monthly all right it's a little bit more expensive but
12:54:14
then you don't have to pay for the entire year up front then click on subscribe now you will see this page and
12:54:22
then all you have to do is add your payment information and then click on pay And
12:54:28
subscribe all right so after subscribing open the app again and then click on the
12:54:34
project and now it's time to start developing the portfolio the first thing we'll do is to change
12:54:40
the size of the desktop break point because uh here in framer it's set to
12:54:46
1200 and we have to change it to 1440 right the same size we are using in
12:54:52
figma and to do so we click inside of the canvas and then here on the properties panel we change this to 14 40
12:55:01
and then we press
12:55:07
enter now now let's create the other two breakpoints tablet and mobile and to do so we click this plus sign and then we
12:55:14
click on tablet then we do the same thing and then we click on
12:55:21
phone all right so now we have the three break points desktop tablet and mobile
12:55:26
and the next thing we'll do before we forget is to change the name of the
12:55:31
project so here at the top we click and then we change this to
12:55:41
portfolio and now let's add the grids all right so I'm here in figma and
12:55:47
I've changed the theme to dark mode because since I'm using dark mode in framer it makes sense to also use dark
12:55:54
mode in figma and if you want to change the theme in figma to dark mode you can
12:56:00
do so by going here and then preferences theme and then you choose
12:56:08
dark Mar all right and then after you do that you click on the canvas and then
12:56:15
here what it says page you change the color to a darker color you can use uh you can change it to this color code as
12:56:21
well or you can use a different shade if you want inside of the figma file I've
12:56:28
shared with you you will see this page the style guide so click and then what we'll do now is um
12:56:35
to export this style guide and and then import it into
12:56:41
framer if you are using your own style guide it's the same process all right to
12:56:47
export the style guide and then import it into framer we have to use a plugin so we right click and then we go to
12:56:54
plugins and manage plugins and then here we search for
12:57:00
framer now we see the plug-in right here we double click and then we click on run
12:57:09
now let's select this Frame then we right click
12:57:15
plugins and then figma to HTML with framer all right we
12:57:20
click and then you will see here at the bottom how it copied all the
12:57:26
layers the next step is to open framer and then here on the left side we click
12:57:32
on this uh plus sign right to create a new page and then we'll name this page
12:57:37
Style guide now make sure this Frame is selected by clicking inside and then
12:57:43
pressing control or command V you know to paste the style guide now select the
12:57:48
main frame by clicking here and then we will change the width so in the
12:57:54
properties panel we change it to 1920 which is the width we are using in figma for the sty guide and then change the
12:58:01
height to fit content
12:58:08
okay now scroll down all the way to the bottom until you
12:58:16
see the grades and then we'll start by creating the style for the desktop
12:58:23
grid and to do that we go to the homepage then here on the top left we
12:58:30
click on the framer icon and then we go to view and then we click on show guides
12:58:39
now we select the desktop frame and then here in the properties panel where it says guides we click and
12:58:47
then it will add by default the 12 column grid now let's go back to the style guide and then
12:58:54
see okay so it's 12 columns for desktop and then 32 pixel Gutter and then A40
12:59:01
pixel margin then we go back to the homepage and then while we have this
12:59:08
Frame selected we go to the properties panel we click then we click on this
12:59:14
alignment so it stretches and adapts and then the gap which is the gutter is 32
12:59:21
pixels and then the margin is 40 pixels and then we do the same thing
12:59:27
with the tablet so we select it and then we go to the style guide and then we
12:59:34
check all right so eight columns 24 pixels gutter and then 40 pixel
12:59:40
margin we go back to the homepage and then we make sure this is
12:59:47
selected and then we go to the properties panel and then here we click again and then we change this to eight
12:59:53
pixels and then these to 24 pixels and then we leave these as 40 pixels and then now we can see the grid updated
13:00:02
here now we go back to the style guide page and then we check the mobile so
13:00:09
it's four columns 16 pixels as The Gutter and then 16 pixels as the margin
13:00:16
we go back to the homepage and then we do the same
13:00:26
process four columns then 16 and
13:00:33
16 all right so now that we have the Grid it's time to create the color and text Styles and to do that let's go to
13:00:40
the style guide scroll up until you see the colors
13:00:46
all right and then we can already see that we have to add the black color and then white and then these other five
13:00:54
Colors Let's Start by adding our color black so let's zoom in and then let's copy the color code controll or command
13:01:01
C and then here next to pages and layers you see assets click here and then where
13:01:08
it says Styles click the plus sign and then click on color style now
13:01:14
let's paste the color code here let's add the name black and then create and
13:01:22
now we have the color code here now let's create the color white
13:01:27
but instead of copying the color code we'll basically use the Color Picker so we do the same thing right here and the
13:01:33
color style and then here you click on the Color Picker and then you select the
13:01:39
color and you will see how it adds the color code automatically now you add the
13:01:47
name white in this case and then click on Create and now we have both colors black
13:01:54
and
13:01:59
white now create the rest of the color styles by following the same process and
13:02:05
the next thing we'll do is create the text Style scroll down until you see this
13:02:10
typography and phone sizes I switch to figma for a second and
13:02:17
uh I want to show you something I already showed you how to create textiles manually right by adding this
13:02:23
um information right here like manually you click here and then you add the
13:02:30
information right that is another way to do it let me show you right
13:02:36
now A more common and efficient way to do it is to apply the style beforehand
13:02:42
for example if I select this uh title right and I go to the properties
13:02:48
panel I can already see the information applied and if I want to create a new text stle based on this information I
13:02:55
can do so by clicking these four dots right here and then this plus sign and
13:03:00
as you can see the information is already added right and then you just have to add the name and then create
13:03:07
Style now I've switched over to framer and
13:03:12
we'll create the textiles using this more efficient method and we didn't use
13:03:17
this method um with the colors we could right but adding the the colors uh with
13:03:23
the Color Picker or the color code is also very easy because it's only one thing that you have to add right that's
13:03:30
why I created the uh color styles manually by clicking here so to create the text Styles we
13:03:37
select the text text in this case we will start with the title and then here in the properties
13:03:43
panel where it says Styles we click here and then new style and then this will be
13:03:48
the style for the heading one so we apply it and now you can see it right
13:03:54
here now let's rename it by right clicking and then clicking on rename and we'll call it titles and then
13:04:04
desktop now framer will add automatically here
13:04:10
the font size and the line height for your reference now let's create the next
13:04:16
style which is for the CTA so we select it and then we do the same thing here
13:04:24
and then new style and then in this case we'll uh choose paragraph and we will add a
13:04:30
custom name but don't use the you know the headings because these are for titles and subtitles and so on all right
13:04:36
so choose p graph and then we go here and then we right click and then
13:04:43
rename and then we write CTA text
13:04:49
desktop we press enter and now create the uh rest of the
13:04:58
textiles all right so now we have all the textiles and you can reorder them by
13:05:05
just dragging so feel free to do so
13:05:11
I know that creating all these Styles is a little bit tedious but it will save us a lot of time later
13:05:17
on now let's go to the homepage let's click on you know pages and then
13:05:23
homepage and what we'll do now is basically duplicate the homepage and
13:05:29
then we'll create a template and every time we uh you know want to create a new
13:05:34
page we'll use that template and we'll do that in order to consult the gdes before creating the template we
13:05:41
have to resize this breakpoint since we are using the 1440 break point in your
13:05:48
figma so here in the properties panel let's change it to
13:05:54
1440 let's move it here and that's it now we go here and then we right click
13:06:00
and then we click on duplicate and now we double click and rename these two
13:06:06
template and now here we have the template and every time we create a new
13:06:13
page we'll basically duplicate this all right so let's click and then let's
13:06:19
rename these components and here we basically host all of our
13:06:27
components now let's switch over to figma and then let's go to the components
13:06:34
page and then we'll start creating the desktop components and the first one
13:06:39
we'll create is the header so let's select it and then here in the properties panel we can check the width
13:06:46
which is 1360 and then the height 89 pixels and this width and this height
13:06:52
are temporary okay because when we uh create the component in framer and we
13:06:58
place uh the instance inside of the pages we'll set the width to field container and then the height to fet so
13:07:06
these units don't really matter right they are temporary however when you are working with a developer or with a team
13:07:12
it's better if you already set the right properties here in figma so basically you set the width to fi container and
13:07:19
then the height to hug but in this case since we are doing also the development it doesn't really matter when you access
13:07:27
the figma file you will probably see this set to fi container and hug and that's because at the end I like to do a
13:07:34
check and make sure all components are set corre correctly because you never know when you will bring in or someone
13:07:40
to work on the project right so feel free to set it in figma to fixed or if you prefer you can also set it to field
13:07:47
container and hug because that's even better so do whatever you want now let's switch over to framer and for now we can
13:07:54
delete these two break points because we'll focus on the desktop components so
13:08:01
right click and then delete now let's select this Frame and then let's change the background color color to
13:08:10
Black now while we have this Frame selected we press F on our keyboard and then we draw a frame something like this
13:08:18
and then now in the properties panel let's add the width which was
13:08:25
1360 and then the height 89 pixels and then let's click here to align it to the
13:08:33
center and now while we have the frame selected
13:08:39
we go to the properties panel right here and then we remove the color and then we add a border like a temporary border so
13:08:46
we click and then we change this to White just so we can see the frame we
13:08:53
will remove it later now let's switch over to figma again and now we'll basically add the
13:09:00
logo let's increase the Border a little bit so let's uh select the frame and then in the properties panel we click
13:09:07
and then we change it to three now while we have the frame selected let's press F on our
13:09:14
keyboard and then let's draw another frame inside of it and then we'll do the same thing here in the properties panel
13:09:21
we remove the color and then we add a border we change the color to
13:09:27
white and then we go back and then we change this to
13:09:33
three now while we have these frame selected we press t on our keyboard then we click and then we write the logo in
13:09:41
my case my full [Music] name the text is not very visible but
13:09:48
we'll fix it now let's switch over to figma and then let's uh press control and click to select this text and then
13:09:55
in the properties panel we can see that this is the uh text style okay medium
13:10:02
text desktop so let's switch over again to framer and while we have the text
13:10:08
selected let's go to the properties panel and then here where it says style we click and then we apply the style and
13:10:15
now let's add a color which will be white now let's move it a little bit
13:10:22
right here for now now back in figma and we'll draw
13:10:27
this frame in a framer okay and we don't have to always look at the size because
13:10:35
uh we'll apply Auto layout right so we just have to draw something similar to this for
13:10:40
now before we continue make sure to click here where it says layers so you can see the structure of all the layers
13:10:48
at the time of this recording framework doesn't have a way to automatically rename the layers right so we have to
13:10:54
rename them manually for personal projects it's not mandatory right it doesn't matter if you don't um you know
13:11:00
rename the layers however it's a good idea to get used to it that way when you
13:11:06
design a project for a client and then build it renaming layers will come
13:11:11
naturally to rename the layers you simply double click and then you rename them we can call this one
13:11:19
Heather container and then this [Music]
13:11:25
one now let's select this Frame okay the header container and then we press F on
13:11:31
our keyboard and then we draw a frame inside of it which will be the navigation container now we do the same
13:11:38
thing we did with the other
13:11:48
frames now we rename the
13:11:57
frame now inside of this Frame we'll create another frame which will be for the menu items so we press F and then we
13:12:04
draw a frame and then we do exact the same
13:12:19
thing now let's write here menu
13:12:24
item and then we apply the
13:12:30
textile and we add a color
13:12:37
now let's go back to figma and then we can see how we have one two three and
13:12:43
four menu items so here in framer let's select
13:12:48
this Frame and then let's rename
13:12:54
it to menu item container and then while we have this
13:12:59
Frame selected we press alt and then we drag to create a copy and then another
13:13:04
copy and then the fourth copy Cy now we can hide the grid by pressing alt G on
13:13:11
our keyboard now we'll activate our layout and here in framer it's not called or
13:13:18
layout right it's called Stacks but it's essentially the same thing let's start
13:13:24
by activating it on this Frame so let's select it and then press shift
13:13:29
a just like in figma now here in figma when we uh select this Frame we can see
13:13:35
the properties okay so it's set to hug hug
13:13:41
right and here in framer we can see the properties set to fit fit which is the
13:13:47
same thing so fit fit is hug hug all right now here in figma we can also see
13:13:53
how the menu navigation container it's also set to hug hug now let's select the
13:13:59
menu navigation container here in framer and then let's press shift a to activate Auto layout
13:14:07
now here in figma we can check the properties right here okay and we can see that the spacing between items is uh
13:14:14
48 pixels and then the uh padding is uh 32 pixels on all
13:14:23
sides oh and don't worry about the alignment because it makes no difference right like if we change the alignment it
13:14:30
makes no difference because it said to hug hug all right so there is no space for it to be aligned in a a different
13:14:37
position so while we have this Frame selected we go here in the properties
13:14:42
panel and then we apply the properties this option is to set the
13:14:49
pattern individually right but in this case we want to add the same padding on all sides so we write here 32 pixels and
13:14:58
then the gap which is the space between items 2 48 pixels
13:15:07
now let's show the grid by pressing alt G on our keyboard and then let's select this Frame okay the header
13:15:14
container and then let's activate Auto layout shift a now here in the properties panel let's
13:15:22
set it to fix then let's resize it to align with
13:15:27
the grid and now in the properties panel
13:15:33
where it says distribute we change it to space
13:15:39
between okay now let's hide the grid by pressing
13:15:44
alt G on our keyboard and then now we'll start formatting the header now here in
13:15:49
figma we check the colors so we have this Frame selected the menu navigation
13:15:55
container and we can see here in the properties panel that we are using the dark graphite color we can see it here
13:16:01
as well now here in framer we set the frame
13:16:07
and then here in the properties panel where it says fill we click and then we select dark
13:16:14
graphite now we can remove all the borders and we don't have to uh remove them individually right we can just
13:16:21
select all these and then in the properties panel we remove the border right
13:16:28
here now here in figma we can see that the corner radius is
13:16:34
six so let's apply the corner radius here in framer so let's select the frame
13:16:39
and here in the properties panel where it says radius we change it to
13:16:45
six and now the corner radius is applied okay now let's create the bouet call
13:16:52
Buton and to do so let's select this Frame and then right click and duplicate
13:16:58
and now remove all these menu items okay these
13:17:03
frames and then this one you you can write
13:17:09
here B call right and then we'll change the background color
13:17:15
to white here in the properties panel and then we select the text that's
13:17:23
inside and then we change it to Black now select the button and press
13:17:31
the right arrow on your keyboard now let's select the button
13:17:38
and then let's change the name right here to
13:17:43
CTA [Music] container then here CTA item
13:17:52
container now here in figma we can see how these navigation menu and then the
13:17:58
button are group inside of an oral layout frame so let's do the same thing in framer
13:18:07
in order to add these two frames in then inside of an auto layout frame or stack
13:18:12
here in framer we have to select both like we click and then press shift and then select the other one and here we
13:18:19
can't just press shift a all right it doesn't work like that we have to right click and then here where it says add
13:18:26
stack we click now they are grouped all right
13:18:32
inside of a stack and what we have to do is here in the properties panel we
13:18:37
change this to fit content and then the Gap we change it to 32
13:18:44
pixels now let's rename the menu items so let's select the text and here we write work and then
13:18:52
here we write playground and
13:18:59
then here sorry about
13:19:06
and then here
13:19:11
contact now here in FMA when we select the frame containing the menu item we
13:19:16
can see in the properties panel that they are set to hug hug right so we have
13:19:22
to do the same thing in a framer all right so here in framer we
13:19:27
select this Frame make sure you are not selecting the text directly right you are selecting the frame containing the
13:19:33
text and then you press and maintain shift and then you select this one and then this one and then this one and now
13:19:40
here in the properties panel you set these two FIT content and then these two FIT
13:19:45
content and then you'll do the same thing with the frame containing the bouet call
13:19:51
text go to the properties panel and then fit content and then fit
13:19:56
content now let's make sure um this is responsive okay because if we resize the
13:20:02
um the main frame we can see that this is not uh responsive let me show you if
13:20:08
we click here and then here we resize this we can see how it's not
13:20:18
responsive and in figma we would basically select this main frame and then activate or layout right but we
13:20:24
cannot do that in framer so we'll consider this Frame as
13:20:30
the primary or root frame and then we'll create a main frame which will contain all the other
13:20:38
frames so let's create a frame by pressing F on our keyboard and then we draw something like this and then we go
13:20:45
to the properties panel and then we remove the color and we add a
13:20:57
border all right and now we have to convert this Frame into a stack so activate Auto layout right and in figma
13:21:04
we can do it by selecting the frame and pressing shift a but it doesn't work in framer if the frame is empty okay so it
13:21:12
has to have something inside if the frame is empty we uh right click and
13:21:18
then click on ADD stack you can also use the shortcut all
13:21:23
right the problem with this though is that the frame we had didn't convert to
13:21:29
a stack it was basically added inside of a stack right this is the frame and we
13:21:34
don't want that I wanted to show you this is because you are probably used to uh pressing shift a all the time and
13:21:41
here in framer it's a little bit different if the frame had other nested frames inside this wouldn't happen Okay
13:21:49
let me give you an example so if we go back now we have the frame and then I will create a frame inside now when we
13:21:57
select the main frame and then we press shift a it converts to a stack okay
13:22:06
so instead of creating a new frame what we'll do is Select this Frame all right the header and then we right
13:22:14
click and then we click on ADD stack you can also use this shortcut
13:22:20
okay and now we have the stack and we can change the name to main
13:22:27
container main
13:22:33
container now let's select the Heather container and then we will change the width to
13:22:39
F all right now let's see how it behaves when we resize the
13:22:45
window as you can see it's
13:22:50
responsive let's go back and now let's add the padding let's
13:22:57
switch over to figma now here in figma we go to the design
13:23:04
page then let's Zoom and then we select this main frame and then in the
13:23:09
properties panel right here we can see how the padding is 40 pixels okay on all
13:23:18
sides now let's select the main frame and don't do it by clicking on this Frame because you will accidentally
13:23:25
select the header container so select it here directly in the layers panel now we
13:23:30
go to the properties panel right here and then we add a 40 pixel padding on
13:23:36
all sides now let's align this Frame to the top right
13:23:43
here now let's click anywhere here and then press alt G to show the grid and
13:23:50
make sure that everything is perfectly
13:23:58
aligned let's now hide the grid by pressing alt plus G and then here in the
13:24:04
layers panel we select the header container then we right click and then we click on
13:24:09
create component this will pop up and then
13:24:15
let's modify the name by adding this dark
13:24:20
mode desktop and then
13:24:26
create let's close this so here in framer every time we create a component
13:24:32
the component is isolated inside of the component canvas okay okay which is where we are right
13:24:42
now whenever you want to go back to the design page you can just click
13:24:47
here all right and you will be taken back and then you can double click on the component to go back to the
13:24:54
component canvas so here we have different options and we can create a variant right here
13:25:00
so for example for tablet and mobile we create different variants and then here we have the cover state which is
13:25:07
basically a temporary variant okay so let's say we want um this button to turn
13:25:12
to a different color when we hover we can do that with this
13:25:18
option let me show you how it works so when we click here right and then we
13:25:24
click on Hover now we have the hover version okay and then I will now change
13:25:30
the background color on this button here in the properties panel we change it to this color
13:25:37
and then I will also change the text to
13:25:44
White while I was setting the color the background color for this button I just
13:25:49
noticed that this uh orange color is not um accessible when combined with the
13:25:56
white text so let's fix it it's basically the color we are using
13:26:03
here all right and also
13:26:15
here so here in figma we go to the style
13:26:20
guide then let me Zoom here we'll change this color but first
13:26:26
we have to make sure that the Scala combination is uh you know not accessible and then change it and we'll
13:26:34
use cloud for this let's copy the color
13:26:41
code now I'm here inside of the cloud web app and I will write
13:26:48
this can you tell me if this color
13:26:53
[Music] combination and
13:27:02
then then I paste the color code
13:27:13
and then I would say and then press enter
13:27:43
so now here we have the result and as we can see it only passes
13:27:49
this test and it's funny because here the AI is telling us that it doesn't
13:27:55
pass the AA level requirement and here it's telling us that it passes the test so I wrote this
13:28:07
and then Cloud responded this so you have to be very careful when using Ai
13:28:12
and always double check in this case what I did to double check is to visit this website okay and then I checked at
13:28:21
the information it provided me after adding the color codes and I compare this with what cloud
13:28:29
said to make sure I make a more informed decision and you don't have to use uh
13:28:35
this website specifically there are many um like this throughout the
13:28:40
internet now I will ask Cloud to give me some color combination Alternatives that are accessible and we'll choose one so
13:28:48
here we can write something like
13:28:57
this here is the result and this is the original color all right which is not
13:29:02
totally accessible and then we have these barkers shade and this is the
13:29:07
color we'll use so let's copy the color code now let's go back to this
13:29:14
website and then let's paste the color code here so as we can see here it
13:29:21
passes the standard requirement for large text and also for normal text and
13:29:26
it fails to pass the strictest requirement for normal text but it's
13:29:31
fine because that isn't required for what we need it for all right so as you can see here I've updated this color so
13:29:39
instead of Clementine it's now a cinnamon and the beauty of this is that
13:29:45
when we update the color style it updates the color throughout the entire design as you can see
13:29:53
here right now let's make sure we have the
13:30:00
color code copied I will just now copy this color code and now here in framer I
13:30:06
will go to assets and then I will update the color Style by pasting the color code right
13:30:13
here and then I will also rename the
13:30:21
color all right so let's continue with the component so here we have the primary variant and then here we have
13:30:28
the hover State and then when we preview the uh live website right here and then
13:30:34
we hover we can see how this button changes but this is not ideal because we
13:30:41
want the background color of this button to change only when we hover the button okay but now what happens is now it
13:30:48
changes whenever we hover anywhere within the header
13:30:54
container I will show you how to do that right now let's go to the components
13:30:59
page let's remove the hover State and then we select this button we right
13:31:05
click C and then create component then we click on
13:31:11
create so now we have the button right here and this is now a nested component
13:31:17
okay so it's a component inside of this component now let's click here to create
13:31:23
the hover State and then while we have this button selected let's change the
13:31:29
color so the background will be cinnamon and then the text
13:31:36
will be white now when we preview this we can
13:31:44
see how it works perfectly now let's see if it works in
13:31:50
the main component so let's go back and then let's click here and then let's
13:32:00
preview and now it works perfectly all right the hover state only activates
13:32:05
when we hover over the button and not anywhere
13:32:11
else let's go back so if you are wondering why I
13:32:16
didn't design the variance in figma it's because I will teach you how variance
13:32:21
work in the next module all right all right so now we'll create a variant of
13:32:27
this component here in framer for each break point let's select the main
13:32:32
component and then here where it says variant we
13:32:37
click and then now we have the main component and then we have the variant right here okay it's named by default
13:32:46
variant two and this will be the tablet version
13:32:51
of the header so here in the uh layers panel we can already change the names
13:32:56
for variant one and two this is the main variant right this that's why it says primary so let's change the name to
13:33:04
desktop and then
13:33:10
tablet all right so now here in figma we'll basically check the properties of
13:33:16
the tablet version of the component so we select it and then here in the properties panel we can see how it set
13:33:23
to field container and then the spacing is automatic and then it has a zero
13:33:28
padding and the menu also changes right the navigation menu instead of the full
13:33:34
navigation menu it's just a button right so let's recreate it in framer here we
13:33:39
can already remove the booket call button and then we remove all the menu
13:33:46
items except for one okay so here in the layers panel we can
13:33:52
select three okay so one two and three we can make sure they are selected and then we remove them and
13:34:00
then here instead of contact we will change it to menu now let's make these
13:34:07
smaller and don't worry too much about the exact size because we'll basically
13:34:13
set these two fill later on okay now let's select this text and then
13:34:19
while we press and maintain shift let's select this text and then here in the properties panel we will change this to
13:34:26
medium text tablet now let's create the mobile
13:34:33
variant and we can do that by selecting the tablet variant and then here we click where it says variant it's
13:34:40
basically the same process all right now let's go to the layers panel and then let's change the name of the
13:34:48
variant now we do the same thing we did with the tablet variant so we resize
13:34:53
this a little bit and then we select this press and maintain shift we select this and then in the properties panel we
13:35:01
change the text style to medium text
13:35:07
mobile now since we'll use this component for desktop tablet and mobile we'll change the name right here we
13:35:15
double click and then rename and then we'll remove this part
13:35:24
okay now let's see if this works so let's go to the components page right
13:35:30
here and then let's select this Frame all right this one the main
13:35:36
container then we go to the homepage we change the background to
13:35:46
Black and then we paste now let's select the component in
13:35:52
the tablet breakpoint and then here in the properties panel where it says variant we change it to
13:35:59
tablet and then we select the component in the mobile breakpoint and we do the same thing and then we choose
13:36:08
mobile now let's test and see if it works so we click on
13:36:14
preview and then as we resize we can see how it
13:36:21
changes so it works perfectly let's go back to the
13:36:26
components page now let's switch over to figma now
13:36:34
it's time for you to practice this so here is an exercise create all these components in framework and only the
13:36:41
dark mode components okay and as always if you have any questions go to webdesigners collective.com join the
13:36:48
community if you are not a member yet and then ask any questions you have actually I will create the next
13:36:54
component so you don't get stuck and then you will create the rest let's create a frame by pressing F on our
13:37:00
keyboard and then we draw a frame now let's show the grid alt plus G
13:37:06
and then let's move it here for now now here in figma we check the properties of
13:37:11
this component so we click and then we can see that it's set to um fixed all
13:37:17
right and this is the size and then inside we have the image which is set to
13:37:26
fill fil all right and then the text is set to hug
13:37:33
hug now we'll create text that goes here so we press t on our keyboard and then
13:37:38
we click and then we write project
13:37:44
name and discipline now while we have the uh text selected we go to the proper
13:37:50
panel and then we apply the uh style which is medium text desktop then we set
13:37:58
the color to white now we select the frame and then
13:38:03
we press and maintain shift then we select the text we right click and then we click on ADD
13:38:11
stack now in figma I will check again the size of this Frame so I will click
13:38:17
on it and then in the properties panel I can see it's uh 664 and then
13:38:25
741 so now while we have the stack selected we go here in the properties
13:38:30
panel and then we change this to fixed and then we add at
13:38:36
664 and then the height [Music]
13:38:42
741 now let's select this Frame which will be the image and then here we set
13:38:48
it to fill and then fill and here in the properties panel
13:38:54
instead of using a color we'll use an image so we click
13:39:00
here now we select the text and then in the properties panel we can see it set to fit fit okay which is the equivalent
13:39:07
of hug hug in figma now let's select the
13:39:13
stack and then in the properties panel we align it to the
13:39:19
left now I will change the name right here and then I will name it project
13:39:27
card dark mode startop and since this will be a
13:39:34
component you you can name it uh you know this way and then as you create the variance you can remove the desktop part
13:39:41
and then the dark mode part after you set the light mode and this is the way I
13:39:46
like to do it but you don't have to do it this way you can just name it project
13:39:51
card all right it's fine now let's add this stack inside of
13:39:58
the main container and to do it we just drag and
13:40:03
then when we see this line we can drop and now we can see how it's inside of the main
13:40:12
container and now let's convert this into a component so we right click and
13:40:17
then create component so we have the primary
13:40:23
component and the next step is to create the variance let's go back to the components
13:40:30
page and now you can continue by creating the uh different variants for the second component and then all the
13:40:37
other components so here we have all the components here in framer and as you can
13:40:43
see we have all the variance right for desktop tablet and mobile okay all all
13:40:51
these components all
13:40:57
right so I hope you were able to create them and if not you can always add task
13:41:05
inside of the community okay that way you will not get stuck now let's go to the
13:41:13
homepage and let's continue with the design here in figma we can see this
13:41:18
Frame all right and this contains all the information that will go into the uh hero section and we can already see that
13:41:26
it's basically a frame with some lested frames inside all right so let's copy
13:41:33
this text all right so copy the text not the frame okay here is what I mean this is what
13:41:41
you have to copy not this all right just the text in order to copy layers in figma
13:41:49
then paste the layers in framer you have to have this plugin all right so install
13:41:54
this plugin right now if you don't have it now you have to select the layer in
13:41:59
this case this text and then right click click on plugins and then click on figma
13:42:06
to HTML with framer and then now you can paste it here in framer we can also copy and
13:42:13
paste multiple layers at once and to do that we just have to uh select this layer so press control and click
13:42:20
remember to do that if you want to uh select the text only which is what we want right now because if you just click
13:42:27
you will select the frame and you want to select the uh layer inside of the frame which is the text okay and now we
13:42:34
press control the shift okay to select the text and then we click and now we have these two layers selected and then
13:42:41
we right click we go to plugins and then we click
13:42:49
here now we paste the text in
13:42:57
framer now let's select each one of these and let's add a stack all right to this one
13:43:05
this one and then to this one now let's select these three stacks
13:43:11
while we press and Rain shift and then we right click and then we add the
13:43:17
stack now while we have the stack selected we go to the property spanel and then here we change the direction to
13:43:26
horizontal now let's rename this tags this will be the hero container
13:43:51
now let's select this container and then we press and maintain shift and we select this container and then we add a
13:44:00
stack and now while we have this stack selected in the properties panel we change the direction to
13:44:08
Vertical now we'll change this to space between and then the height to
13:44:16
fill and now let's align it to the left now let's select this
13:44:24
stack and then let's change this to
13:44:30
190 and then let's select the text and let's change it to
13:44:37
fill now it looks how it's supposed to look now let's select the hero container
13:44:44
and then let's press contrl X to cut it then let's select the main container and then let's press contrl V and now the uh
13:44:52
hero container is inside of the main container now here in figma we check for
13:44:59
the spacing between these two sections and it's 144 pixels
13:45:05
so here in framer we select the main container and then in the properties panel we change the Gap to 144
13:45:14
pixels now let's select this stack and then in the properties panel we change the width to fit
13:45:21
content and then now we select the hero container and then we change this to
13:45:28
space between now it's time to work on the
13:45:33
tablet breakpoint so here in figma we can already see that
13:45:40
the U you know in the tablet break point the layout is different so let's set it this way in
13:45:45
framer since now we are focusing on the tablet breakpoint let's collapse the desktop break point right here in the
13:45:51
layers panel and then now we'll select this uh stack but we'll do it in the layers
13:45:58
panel to make sure we select this stack and now let's drag it out right
13:46:04
here for now the next thing we'll do is to select the hero container and then in
13:46:11
the properties panel we'll change the direction to vertical and now while we have these uh
13:46:20
stack selected we change the height to fit content now in figma we uh check the
13:46:27
spacing right here which is 80 pixels now we select the hero container
13:46:35
and then we set this to start and then the Gap to 80
13:46:43
pixels now while we have the hero container selected we align it to the
13:46:48
left and then we select the description container all right and then we set the width to
13:46:58
fill now let's add this stack okay so and to do it let's go to
13:47:03
the layers panel and and then let's select it all right and then contrl X to cut and then we select the hero
13:47:10
container and then we paste it it's automatically added
13:47:17
here now it's time to apply the textile so let's select this uh text layer and
13:47:22
then we press control we select this one as well and then in the properties panel
13:47:28
we set the style which is large text tablet and then we add the color white
13:47:34
right and then we do the same thing here okay we select it and then we add small
13:47:42
text taet and then color
13:47:48
white here in figma we can see that the spacing is 80 pixels all right so we'll
13:47:55
set this spacing also at 80 pixels in framer so let's select the main
13:48:01
container and then let's change these to 80 pixels now let's collapse the tablet uh
13:48:09
breakpoint so we can focus on the mobile breakpoint okay so here in figma we can
13:48:15
see how this section is set up almost the same way as the tablet version right
13:48:21
the only thing that changes is the textile in the spacing so let's set it up in framer all right so here in framer
13:48:29
let's go to the layers spanel and then let's expand the main container and then let's select the hero
13:48:36
container and in the properties panel Let's uh set the direction to
13:48:43
Vertical now let's select this stack and then let's move it
13:48:48
out now let's select this stack and then the stack and then let's set the WID to
13:48:58
fill now let's select this stack only and then let's set the height to
13:49:07
content now here in figma we check the spacing and we can see it's 40
13:49:15
pixels now let's add this stag into the hero container so let's cut it control+
13:49:22
X and then we select the hero container and then we paste it
13:49:27
here now we select the hero container then we change this to start
13:49:35
and then we set the space into uh 40
13:49:40
pixels and now while we have the hero container selected we align the items
13:49:46
inside to the left now back in figma let's see which
13:49:51
spacing we should set here 80 pixels so in framer let's select the
13:49:58
main container and then let's change the Gap to 80 pixels
13:50:05
now it's time to set the text stles so let's select this layer and then here in the properties
13:50:11
panel we select small text mobile and then we set the color to
13:50:20
white now we select the description and then we do the same
13:50:26
thing we select large text mobile then the color to white
13:50:36
now we select the tagline and then we set it
13:50:42
to large text mobile and then
13:50:48
white now let's select the main container and then let's change the
13:50:53
padding to 16 pixels now here in figma I can see how
13:51:00
this Frame this one right has a WID
13:51:05
of 160 pixels so let's change the width of this
13:51:10
tag here in framer to 160
13:51:19
pixels now it's time to check if the responsiveness of the website is working properly so let's click
13:51:26
here and then let's [Music]
13:51:31
see excellent now let's go back to the
13:51:39
homepage now let's start working on the work section this section all right and it's
13:51:45
very easy just a frame and then two listed frames and then one frame for
13:51:53
each of these services and we didn't create a
13:51:59
component for the section because we are only using it in the homepage
13:52:04
all right so here in framer we press t on our keyboard and then we click and we
13:52:10
write work all right now while we have this
13:52:15
selected here in the properties panel we select the title style for theop now
13:52:21
let's set the color to white now we press t on our keyboard
13:52:27
again then we click and then we write the first service web design and then here in the prop spanel
13:52:35
we set it to small text desktop and then we set the color to
13:52:42
white and now while we have the text selected all right we press alt on our
13:52:48
keyboard and then we make a copy and then we make another copy now we change this to
13:52:55
branding and then this to Consulting and now we add a stack on
13:53:01
each one so we select it and then right click and add stack do the same thing
13:53:06
here and then the same thing here now here in the layers panel we can rename
13:53:12
this
13:53:23
Tex something like this now we select these three stacks
13:53:29
while we press and Rain shift and then we add a stack
13:53:35
and then we'll name this stack service
13:53:43
list now let's select the title and then let's add a stack as well and then let's
13:53:49
change the name to
13:53:55
title now we select the title container then we press and maintain shift and select the service list container and
13:54:02
then in the properties panel we take the WID to fit content now we select the service
13:54:09
container so we press and maintain control and then we click click here and then here and then we change the WID to
13:54:16
fit content now let's select this stack and then we press and maintain shift we
13:54:23
select this stack as well and then we right click and add a stack and we can
13:54:28
name this tag work container
13:54:34
now here in the properties panel we change the direction to horizontal and then space
13:54:42
between now here in figma we have to check for the spacing between these
13:54:48
items which is 8 pixels so let's set that up here in
13:54:56
framer so we select the service list container and then we change the Gap to
13:55:01
8 pixels and now while we have the service list container selected we also
13:55:07
change the alignment and align it to the left now it's time to add this container
13:55:13
inside of the main container so here in the uh layers panel we select this container and then we press control X to
13:55:21
cut it and then we select the main container and then we press contrl + V to paste
13:55:27
it and now we just have to uh simply change the textiles in the tablet
13:55:33
breakpoint and also in the mobile breakpoint here I've set the uh textiles
13:55:38
for the tablet breakpoint and then here for the mobile breakpoint and you already know how to do it so make sure
13:55:43
you do it now let's click here to check the
13:55:51
responsiveness excellent let's go
13:55:57
back now it's time to add the future project section keep in mind that here in figma
13:56:03
we are using a a grid that wraps right but in framer we'll use a different method basically we'll um create two
13:56:10
stacks all right and then each of these Stacks will have two project cards so
13:56:15
the implementation will be different but it will look exactly like this the only difference is that creating two stacks
13:56:23
is better for responsiveness all right so here in framer we have to go to the components
13:56:29
page and then we select this component and then we copy it we go back to to the
13:56:35
homepage and then we paste it right here now while we have these frame selected
13:56:41
we press alt and then we drag to create a copy and now we go here in the layers
13:56:47
panel and then we select both by pressing a maintaining shift then we right click and then click on ADD
13:56:55
stack now here in the proper panel we set the direction to
13:57:01
horizontal now here in figma let's check the spacing which is 32 pixels now back
13:57:08
in framer while we have the stack selected all right we set the spacing to
13:57:14
32 pixels now let's select each one of the components individually and then let's
13:57:21
add a stack and then this one as
13:57:27
well now let's rename the layers this will be called featured
13:57:35
projects container and then this will be called project
13:57:42
card container and this the same
13:57:50
thing now let's select this container and then let's press crl X to
13:57:56
cut it and then we select the main container and then we paste it here
13:58:04
now when we preview the page right here we can see how uh these instances are
13:58:11
fixed right we want the images to expand or Shrink as we resize the screen and
13:58:17
we'll do that right now go back now let's select this instance and
13:58:24
then we press and maintain shift and we select this instance as well and now we have both instances selected then we go
13:58:32
to the properties panel and then we click here on this lock icon to lock the aspect ratio all right and
13:58:41
then we set the we to fill now let's select the primary stack
13:58:48
this one and then let's set the height to fit
13:58:54
content now let's check the responsiveness again
13:59:04
it works let's go
13:59:10
back now let's duplicate this stack all right so while we have this
13:59:16
tack selected we can press contrl C and then contrl
13:59:23
V now we select this stack and then we press and maintain shift and we select this stack so these two stacks right and
13:59:32
then we right click and then we select I mean we click on ADD
13:59:37
stack now here in figma we check this spacing which is 56
13:59:44
pixels now in framer while we have this stack selected we go to the properties
13:59:49
panel and then we change the cap to 56 pixels now let's set the tablet in the
13:59:56
mobile variant so let's start with the tablet so we select this instance and then we press and maintain shift we
14:00:02
select this instance and this instance and this one like all of them and then in the properties panel we change the
14:00:08
variant to tablet and then we do the same thing in the mobile breakpoint so we select this
14:00:15
one press and maintain shift we select this one and this one and this one and then in the proper spanner we change
14:00:21
this to mobile now here in the mobile breakpoint we select this stack so this one and
14:00:29
then we change the direction to vertical
14:00:35
now we select the other one this one and then we do the same
14:00:43
thing now it looks like this which is exactly what we want now let's test the
14:00:53
responsiveness excellent let's go
14:00:58
back now let's add these images and before adding the images we have have to
14:01:04
create some variables not variance but variables let me show you let's double
14:01:09
click on this instance for example now let's say we want to add an image if we click here and then we add an image in
14:01:16
the properties panel right
14:01:21
here what happens is when we go back to the homepage this is apply to all the uh
14:01:29
instances right and this is not what we want because here we have to add add a different image and here a different
14:01:35
image and here a different image right and to do that we have to create
14:01:41
variables so let me reset and let's select this image right
14:01:47
so this layer and then here in the properties panel we click on fi and then
14:01:53
we select create variable and then we click on image and this will pop up and we'll add
14:02:00
a placeholder so let's change the name to placeholder
14:02:05
and then let's click here and then choose an image I will choose this
14:02:14
image now let's go back to the homepage and then while we have this
14:02:20
instance selected we can see here in the properties panel how we can click here
14:02:26
and then add an image I will add this one
14:02:33
and now if we select this instance and we do the same thing we click here we
14:02:38
can add a different image I've added all the images as you
14:02:46
can see and now we have to also create a variable for this text so we double click on the instance then we select the
14:02:54
text and then in the properties panel where it says content we click here and
14:03:00
then create variable and then plain text and now this will pop up and then we can
14:03:06
change the name to project name now let's go back to the
14:03:14
homepage and then we select one of the instances right and then here in the properties panel we can see the variable
14:03:21
so we can remove this text and then add the project
14:03:32
name and and now it changes here and as you can see it only
14:03:39
changes here in this instance not here which is exactly what we
14:03:45
want now I've added all the project names all right but then here in the
14:03:51
tablet breakpoint and in the mobile breakpoint I notice that this text goes
14:03:56
out of frame so let's fix it let's double click on this instance and then here we set the height
14:04:04
of the component to fit content this will make the height to adapt to whatever uh content is inside
14:04:13
now let's select the image and then let's lock the aspect ratio by clicking
14:04:18
on this icon right and this will basically maintain the aspect ratio of the image as we resize our screen now
14:04:27
let's select the text and then let's change the width to fill
14:04:35
with this setting we make sure the text stays within this tag instead of going
14:04:40
out of frame right because if we set it to fit it will try to fit the text and
14:04:45
if the text is too long it will go out of frame let me show you what I mean so if
14:04:51
I set this back to fit content and I go to the
14:04:57
homepage and then I make these text longer let me see
14:05:06
this is what happens all right it goes out of frame however if I
14:05:12
set this text to
14:05:19
fill this is what happens it stays within the frame and
14:05:24
the only thing we have to do left while we have the instance selected is to set the height to fit
14:05:31
content and now these two uh cards are not aligned properly but we
14:05:36
can fix it by selecting this stack all right this one the one containing the
14:05:42
two cards and then we align the content to the top and now it looks
14:05:51
good now here in the desktop breakpoint this is the instance that has the
14:05:57
correct properties all right the width is set to fill and then
14:06:02
the height is set to to fit so let's select this instance and then we press
14:06:07
and maintain shift and then we select this one and then this one and then we set the same properties here fit
14:06:15
content and now we select this Frame all right this one the one
14:06:21
containing these two cards here and then we align the content to the
14:06:27
top and now we have to fix the cards here in the tab breakpoint so
14:06:34
we double click here and then while we have the component selected we set the
14:06:40
high to fit content we do the same thing in the mobile
14:06:49
breakpoint now if I add a larger paragraph here in this instance this is
14:06:55
what happens all right it resizes automatically discard pushing down the content below
14:07:03
now if you notice here in the tablet breakpoint this text in this uh instance is different than this one right and
14:07:11
that's because it has an override so if you go here in the properties panel you
14:07:16
will see this in color blue and then when you click you can reset it all
14:07:21
right and then now you can see the text and whenever you change the text in this
14:07:29
instance right here now it will update also here and also
14:07:37
here in the uh mobile breakpoint all right so now let's add
14:07:43
here the project
14:07:55
title now here in figma we check the spacing between this text and the image
14:08:01
right inside of this component so it's 32 pixels now here in framer let's go to
14:08:08
the component and then let's set the Gap to 32
14:08:19
pixels now it looks good remember that here we have one
14:08:26
stack and then here we have another stack right and then here we have a spacing of 56 pixels right
14:08:34
and the same thing here in the um tablet
14:08:40
breakpoint but then in the mobile breakpoint we have this stack placed horizontally right I mean vertically
14:08:46
right and then this one as well so here we have two stacks all right and then we have the spacing which is also 56 pixels
14:08:55
but then we have to change this right because in this break point we want all the cards to have the same spacing
14:09:02
between them so make sure to select this tack all right the one containing the future
14:09:07
project containers inside of the mobile breakpoint and then here in the properties panel we tange the Gap to 32
14:09:16
pixels and then here in the tablet breakpoint I will actually change it to 40
14:09:28
pixels I will update it here in figma as well in the tablet breakpoint
14:09:34
to 40 pixels and I've noticed an inconsistency
14:09:39
here in figma because the space between the um you know the cards the horizontal
14:09:45
spacing is uh 24 pixels and here in framer it set to 32
14:09:52
pixels all right that's why if we activate the grid we can see how they are not
14:09:59
perfectly align right now if I select this step and then here below I uh press
14:10:05
and maintain shift and select this stack all right so these two stacks and then here in the properties
14:10:12
panel I changed this Gap to 34 pixels now I can see how this aligns
14:10:18
perfectly with be
14:10:24
G now let's test the
14:10:29
responsiveness and as you can see it's excellent
14:10:44
making a website or responsive and adaptive sometimes is very tedious right it's like a very tedious process because
14:10:51
there are multiple ways to do it and sometimes you will get stuck but it's very important that you invest time in
14:10:57
really understanding the concept of responsiveness because once you get it right it's very satisfying
14:11:05
now let's check here in figma which element we should add which is the uh
14:11:10
CTA so here in framer let's go to the components
14:11:15
page and then let's copy this component let's go back to the homepage
14:11:24
then let's select the main container layer this one and then let's paste the
14:11:31
component
14:11:38
now let's select this stack all right the one containing the feature projects containers and then let's select the uh
14:11:44
instance the CTI instance all right and then let's right click and then add
14:11:52
stack now here in figma we check for the spacing it's 120
14:11:59
pixels so now here in framer we select this stack this one all right and then
14:12:06
in the properties panel we change the Gap to 120
14:12:13
pixels now here in figma we can take the spacing here in the tablet
14:12:18
breako 72 pixels and then also in the mobile
14:12:25
breakpoint 80 pixels so we select this stack here in
14:12:31
the tablet breakpoint all right and then in the properties panel we change this to 72
14:12:37
pixels and then we select the one in the mobile breakpoint and then we change it to 80
14:12:46
pixels now we select this instance in the tablet breakpoint and then in the property
14:12:53
spanel we change the variant to tablet and then we do the same thing
14:12:59
here in the mobile breakpoint we select it and change the variant to
14:13:07
mobile all right so I'm here in framer and the next thing we have to add is uh
14:13:12
the footer and then after adding the footer we'll basically create um you know like a stack which will be a
14:13:21
combination of this Frame and then the footer all right and then it's going to
14:13:27
have a um spacing of 200 pixels and then the tablet version
14:13:33
is going to have a spacing of 200 pixels as well and then the mobile version is
14:13:39
going to have a spacing of 120
14:13:44
pixels so here in framer we go to the components
14:13:50
page we have to look for the footer right here then we copy it and then we
14:13:56
go back to the homepage we select the main container
14:14:02
this one and then we paste it here and now we can see the foer right
14:14:11
here now let's change the variant here in the tablet
14:14:17
breakpoint and then also in the mobile
14:14:28
breakpoint now let's select the footer and then let's press and maintain shift and then let's select this stack and
14:14:34
then we right click and we add a stack and now while we have this new
14:14:41
stack selected we go here in the layers panel and then we double click to change the name because sometimes when uh it's
14:14:49
difficult to click on a stack I like to rename it so I can select it here directly in the layers panel so we can
14:14:55
name it
14:15:07
something like this and now while we have it selected we go to the properties panel and then
14:15:13
we add the gap which was for desktop um 2,000 I mean 200
14:15:20
pixels and then for the tablet break point we keep it at 200 and then for
14:15:27
mobile we change it to 120 pixels
14:15:34
now let's check the
14:15:41
responsiveness
14:15:46
brilliant let's go back so now it's time to develop this um
14:15:53
you know expanded menu in the uh tablet breakpoint and also in the mobile breakpoint so when people uh access the
14:16:00
website through a tablet or a phone and then they click on this button this uh menu will expand all
14:16:08
right and then when they click on close it will close now here in framer let's double
14:16:14
click on this instance now we are here in the components page and while we have this selected we create a variant right
14:16:24
here now we have the variant here we can drag it right here so it's
14:16:31
below this tablet or menu variant now while we have this variant selected
14:16:37
let's change the name here in the layers panel we double click and then we add the name
14:16:45
like something like this now we select this stack and then
14:16:52
we press and maintain shift and then select this stack we right click and
14:16:58
then we add a stack and then we can name this stack something like logo
14:17:05
plus menu
14:17:13
container now while we have this stag selected let's right click and then
14:17:18
reset the overwrite now let's select the logo plus
14:17:23
uh menu container here in the desktop breakpoint all right and then in the properties panel we change the
14:17:30
distribution to space between at the moment we created this tag um you
14:17:36
know in this variant it created some overrides okay and then since it's still connected to the other variants the
14:17:43
other variants also change so we basically went back to the uh primary
14:17:48
variant after removing the overrides and then we set the spacing you know like
14:17:54
the space between setting for this stack and now it's updated throughout all the
14:17:59
variants if you are wondering why we went to the
14:18:05
primary variant and we didn't set the space between property here in this variant it's because at the moment we
14:18:12
created this tag inside of this variant it created an override so basically it
14:18:19
creat this stag in the other Varian as I said right but then all the changes and all the edits we make to this variant
14:18:26
stays in this variant so we had to remove the overrides and then go to the primary one and then make all the ne
14:18:32
necessary changes in order to apply them to all the other variants let me show you how overd work
14:18:39
so let's say we want to change the color of this button to Orange here in the properties panel when I change the color
14:18:46
to orange or cinnamon right we can see how the Field property turns to a purple
14:18:52
and this means that we have an override now and as you can see it only applies this color on this variant and now I can
14:18:59
remove this specific override by clicking here and then reset override
14:19:05
okay or I can reset all overrides by selecting this variant and then right
14:19:11
clicking and then click on reset override all right so I will reset these override
14:19:24
now all right so let's continue now let's select this
14:19:29
variant and then make sure you select the variant all right and not the stack that's inside of the
14:19:34
variant and then here in the properties panel we'll set the height to something like 1,000 pixels and this is temporary
14:19:42
okay and then in the properties panel let's align the content to the top we can even add a temporary Border
14:19:51
in order to see the limits of the um variant a
14:19:56
little bit better maybe let's set it to three pixels
14:20:03
now let's create the menu items by clicking here on the canvas and then pressing t on our keyboard then we click
14:20:09
again and then we write work now while we have the text selected we'll go to
14:20:14
the properties panel we click here to select the text stle and then we'll apply the
14:20:20
titles um textile for tablet now we change the color to
14:20:28
white and now we have to rename this stack all right so we change the name to
14:20:33
menu item [Music] container now while we have this tack
14:20:40
selected we press and maintain alt we click and then we drag and we make three
14:20:48
copies now let's select all the menu item stacks and then we press contrl X to cut and then we select this uh stack
14:20:56
right the expanded tablet menu and then we press contrl V and now we have the menu item stack
14:21:03
selected we right click and then we add a stack then here in the properties
14:21:09
panel we choose the vertical Direction now we select the main stack
14:21:15
this one all right make sure you select this one and then we set the direction also
14:21:22
to partical and then now while we have this stack selected all right we go to the
14:21:29
properties panel and then we change the distribution to start now let's select this stack and
14:21:38
then actually let's change the name to menu
14:21:43
items no menu links container and then we go to the
14:21:50
properties panel and then we align it to the left now let's change this to
14:21:59
close now let's select this stack again and then in the properties panel we'll
14:22:04
add a fill so we click here and then we select the color
14:22:10
black now let's connect this button with uh this uh menu all right with the expanded menu and to do so we click on
14:22:18
this button and then we click on this icon right here and then we move the cursor and then we click right here and
14:22:25
then we do the same thing with this button we click on this icon and then we click here
14:22:33
now let's go back to the homepage and then let's check this to
14:22:41
see how it works here all right so as you can see when we click on this button
14:22:46
it pushes the content down and this is not what we want right we want the uh
14:22:52
menu to take over the entire screen so let's set it up that way the first thing we have to do is go
14:22:59
back to the components page so let's double click here now let's select this stack all right
14:23:06
this one and then in the properties panel we set a minan height so we click here and
14:23:13
then we click on minan height and then we choose viewport to make sure that
14:23:19
this stack covers the entire height of the screen and now while we have this Frame
14:23:25
selected all right we go back to the properties panel and then we chest the distribution to start
14:23:33
now we select the parents tag this one and then in the properties panel we
14:23:39
change the height to Fed content and we did that because we
14:23:46
already set this one all right to 100 uh VH right to cover the entire height of
14:23:52
the screen so this will be the minimum height so whatever uh screen size we we
14:23:57
open is going to basically cover the entire height but then the parent frame
14:24:02
should fit the content all right instead of having a fixed height because if not it wouldn't work okay it has to fit the
14:24:10
content and then the nested stack this one in this case will be the one that dictates the height now let's go back to
14:24:17
the homepage and then let's select the uh desktop header container and then what
14:24:23
we have to do now is basically move this out of the main container so we drag it
14:24:30
right here and then in the property spanner we change the position type to
14:24:37
Absolute now since we set the header to Absolute we can see how the content that
14:24:43
was below the header now overlaps with the header right and to fix it we'll basically select the main
14:24:49
container and then in the properties panel we'll set the toab padding to 200
14:24:56
pixels and now we can see how it's set correctly right now let's select the
14:25:03
Heather and then let's set the WID to fit
14:25:08
content I want to show you something when uh we set this heer to fit content
14:25:14
what happens is the heer you know the container tries to fit the content that's inside and then when we click on
14:25:21
preview right here we can see that when we stretch the
14:25:26
screen the header doesn't stretch right and we want it to occupy this same space
14:25:33
horizontally as this content all right so let's set it
14:25:39
up so let's select the Heather and then here in the properties panel we change the width to 100% it will automatically
14:25:46
be set to a relative all right and now as you can see it stretches when we
14:25:51
preview and we resize the screen we can see how it behaves how we want right
14:25:57
still we have to change it because I mean we have to add some pattering on the sides because it doesn't have the
14:26:03
padding right so we have to add a 40 pixel padding for the desktop version so
14:26:08
let's do it right now let's go to the properties panel and then here we write 40 pixels and then here 40 as
14:26:16
well now it looks good as you can see here in the properties panel after setting the
14:26:23
padding on each side you can see how framer turns this into fix automatically
14:26:28
this change isn't about lacking the elements position to the viewport but but it ensures that the padding fits
14:26:34
inside of the 100% width rather than adding to it so framer basically uses
14:26:39
fix to handle this adjustment while keeping the responsive Behavior intact now let's select the header in the
14:26:45
tablet breakpoint and then let's press and maintain shift and we select the header in the mobile breakpoint and now
14:26:51
here in the properties panel let's set the padding on the sides to
14:26:56
zero now let's go to the components page and now while we have the tablet
14:27:03
variant selected let's go to the properties panel and let's set the padding to 40
14:27:09
pixels on all sides let's move it up a little
14:27:15
bit now let's do the same thing with the mobile variant so we select it and then
14:27:22
we set the pad in to 16 pixels in this case now let's do the same thing with
14:27:28
the expanded tablet menu variant so let's click here to select select the header and then let's add a 40 pixel
14:27:35
padding on all sides now let's select this stack all
14:27:41
right this one and then let's set the padding to 40 pixels on all
14:27:48
sides now let's select the variant and then let's remove the
14:27:57
border now let's test to see if it works
14:28:06
all right it works but then when we scroll down we can see the rest of the content right here right let's fix
14:28:14
that so let's select the header in the tablet breakpoint and now in the properties
14:28:20
panel let's change the type to fixed now let's see if it
14:28:27
works all right perfect now let's go go back to the
14:28:32
components page now let's select this button then
14:28:39
let's copy it and then paste it
14:28:45
here now let's remove the logo here in the expanded tablet menu so let's select it and then here in the layers panel
14:28:52
let's make sure we are selecting the logo container and not the text all right and now let's press
14:28:59
delete now let's select the booket call button right here and then let's press the left
14:29:06
key now let's double click on this button to go to the components page and let's create a
14:29:12
variant and this variant will be the tablet variant this one will be the
14:29:22
desktop now let's select the text inside of the tablet
14:29:28
variant and let's change the style to this
14:29:35
one now let's select the tablet variant and let's create the mobile
14:29:43
variant and we do the same thing we select the text and then we change the text
14:29:52
style and now here in the header containers components page we select
14:29:58
this button all right and then we change the variant to tablet
14:30:03
now here in the homepage we click here to preview and then let's click on the
14:30:09
menu and as you can see the button and the expanded menu are a little bit animated right how the button appears
14:30:15
and how the menu expands and we can change that so let's
14:30:21
see let's go back to the homepage then we go to the components page and then here while we have the
14:30:29
variant selected we can go to the properties panel and then when it says transition we can change it to instant
14:30:35
for example right and then we select the expanded tablet menu and we do the same
14:30:40
thing we change it to instant now let's go back to the
14:30:46
homepage and then let's preview and now as you can see the
14:30:52
elements appear instantly let's go back to the components
14:30:58
page and with the transition option you can basically change you know the uh the
14:31:04
transition all right you can play with it right here and then see how it
14:31:13
works now let's rename the menu item so this will be
14:31:19
playground and then now we have to set the container to fit
14:31:27
content and then let's do the same thing with the other to containers and also this one
14:31:33
all right so all the containers we set them to fit
14:31:41
content and let's set the height to fit content as well now let's continue renaming
14:31:54
them and now let's create the mobile variant of the expanded menu let's select this variant
14:32:02
and then let's click here to create the mobile variant now let's change the
14:32:08
[Music]
14:32:14
name now let's select each one of these menu items by clicking and then pressing a maintaining shift and then selecting
14:32:20
the rest and then here in the properties panel we change the text style to the mobile textile this one
14:32:32
now let's select this variant and then we resize it to align with the header
14:32:38
like this now let's select this button and then here in the properties panel we change the variant to
14:32:45
mobile and then let's select the text inside of this button and then in the
14:32:50
properties panel we change the text stle to the mobile version which is this
14:32:58
one let's click on the header to select it and then in the properties panel we
14:33:03
change the padding to 16 pixels and then we do the same thing here we select this stack by clicking and then in the
14:33:10
properties panel we change it to 16
14:33:15
pixels now let's connect this button to the uh mobile header right because right
14:33:21
now it's connected to the tablet breakpoint to do it let's click on this uh little icon right here and then let's
14:33:27
click on the mobile header now it's connected now let's click on this button to select it and
14:33:34
then let's click on this icon and now let's click inside of the expanded mobile menu to connect them now let's
14:33:40
select the mobile header and then in the proper panel we change the transition to
14:33:47
instant now let's go to the homepage and then let's see how it
14:33:58
looks brilliant but when we open the menu and we scroll down we can see the
14:34:03
content that's behind right so let's fix that to fix that we go to the
14:34:08
homepage here on the mobile breakpoint we select the header and then we change the variant here in the prop panel to
14:34:16
expanded mobile menu and now we have to change the type
14:34:22
to fixed now we can
14:34:29
preview and it works
14:34:35
now let's go back to the homepage and then while we have the
14:34:40
Heather selected we change it we change the variant back to
14:34:48
mobile next we'll start working on the behavior of the header but first let's
14:34:53
add a 40 pixel um you know spacing between this header all right in the
14:34:59
desktop uh breakpoint and the top Ed edge of the primary stack so let's
14:35:04
select the header here in the desktop breakpoint and then here in the properties panel we change the type to
14:35:10
fixed and then we set the top position to 40 pixels and now this means that we have a
14:35:18
40 pixel spacing between the Heather and the top edge of the primary
14:35:23
stack now what we have to do is select the header here in the tablet breakpoint and we press and Main shift and we
14:35:29
select it also in the mobile breakpoint because we want to remove this spacing right here all right since the tablet
14:35:36
and the mobile headers already have padding inside of the component so let's go to the properties panel and then
14:35:43
let's set this to zero all right so now let's work on the
14:35:48
behavior of the header so let's click on preview and then as we can see when we
14:35:55
scroll down the Heather stays here at the top right but this is not ideal because it's
14:36:02
um taking uh too much space and you cannot even see the logo when the item
14:36:07
behind it is white so let's change that what we'll do is basically make the
14:36:14
entire header disappear when we scroll down and then make it appear when we scroll up and not up all the way like
14:36:20
let's say we go uh you know to the bottom of the website and then we scroll up it will appear and then when you
14:36:26
scroll down it will disappear and this will wow the user because the user will expect the header to appear when we
14:36:33
scroll all the way up right but then they will scroll up a little bit and then it will appear and then when they
14:36:38
scroll down it will disappear the logo will only appear at the top of the page so when the user Scrolls down the logo
14:36:45
will disappear and the only way to make it appear is to scroll all the way up
14:36:50
and we set the logo this way because when we scroll down the logo will overlap with objects or elements that
14:36:57
have a similar or the same color as the background and we don't want that all right so let's go to the
14:37:04
homepage all right so let's click on this uh header all right to go to the
14:37:09
components page and now let's create a variant of this component so right now I we have this um component
14:37:18
I mean this variant selected right we create another variant by clicking here and now we can move this variant right
14:37:29
here now while we have this variant selected let's change the name
14:37:36
totop something like this now let's select the logo container that's inside
14:37:42
of this variant and in the proper panel where it says visible we change it to
14:37:50
no now let's select this stack inside of the variant and then in the properties
14:37:56
panel we change the distribution to end this way this navigation menu will be aligned L to the
14:38:03
right now let's go back to the homepage and when we preview we can see
14:38:10
how the behavior of the header is not what we want right because we want it to extend all the way and this happened
14:38:17
because we changed the type from absolute to fixed so let's write here
14:38:24
100% it will change to relative automatically and then let's add 40 pixels on each side
14:38:34
now if we preview we can see how it
14:38:43
works now let's set the header so when we scroll down it disappears to do it let's go to the components page and then
14:38:50
while we have the primary variant selected here in the properties panel we click on effects and then we click on
14:38:57
scroll animation now we set the trigger to on scroll the direction replay and and the preset
14:39:04
are already set correctly by default and the effect as well because we wanted to disappear and the opacity is already set
14:39:11
to zero now we can close now let's go back to the
14:39:19
homepage and then if we preview we can see how the header disappears as we
14:39:25
scroll down and then it appears as we scroll up but there is a problem because when
14:39:32
we scroll down and then we scroll up if the logo overlaps with uh something that's white it doesn't look good right
14:39:38
so what we want to do is to make the logo disappear every time we scroll down past the header right and then even if
14:39:46
we scroll up the logo will um still be hidden but then when we scroll all the
14:39:51
way up the logo will appear right here all right let's set it up let's go
14:39:58
back to the homepage and then while we have this stack selected all right the header
14:40:04
we'll create a reference point right because we want this logo basically to disappear when we scroll down past this
14:40:12
section to set it up let's go to the properties panel right here where it says scroll section we click and then we
14:40:18
add a name something like this now here in the
14:40:23
properties panel we go to effects we click and then we click on a scroll variant now we change the trigger to
14:40:30
section in View and then we choose the section which is the header desktop right and
14:40:37
then we set the variant we select the desktop hidden logo variant
14:40:44
right now when we preview we can see how this is not working correctly because when we scroll down and then up nothing
14:40:51
appears and then we scroll all the way up and then down again now it appears and then when we scroll up again and
14:40:58
then down and then up nothing appears so it's not working correctly and that's because we have to set an effect to this
14:41:07
variant right the hidden logo variant so when we have this variant
14:41:12
selected we go to the properties panel and then we click on effects and then we click on scroll animation and then we
14:41:19
set the trigger to on scroll and that's it now let's go to the homepage and then
14:41:25
when we preview again now it will work perfectly right
14:41:32
it disappears when we scroll down it appears when we scroll up right and then when we scroll all the way up the logo
14:41:39
appears all right this is perfect there is an issue though when we
14:41:46
resize the screen we can see how the header is not behaving as expected right
14:41:52
and that's because we have to set a variant for the tablet breakpoint and also for the mobile breakpoint so let's
14:41:58
go to the components page and then while we have the tablet header selected we create a variant by clicking
14:42:06
here now we can move the variant right
14:42:13
here now let's rename
14:42:21
it then let's select the logo container right here and then here in the property
14:42:27
spanner we set the visibility to no
14:42:32
now we select this stack and then we set the distribution to
14:42:38
end this way we move the menu button to the right again after hiding the logo now let's select this
14:42:45
stack and then we can see how the uh you know the effect is already there and
14:42:51
that's because we already set the um the effect in the primary variant which is
14:42:56
the desktop variant so now let's go back to the homepage
14:43:02
now let's select the tablet header and then in the properties panel we click on the effect and then let's
14:43:08
set the variance to tablet hidden logo now when we preview we can see how
14:43:16
the logo is not here and also when we scroll down and up we can see how the menu button is behaving the way it's
14:43:22
supposed to but there is a problem the logo is not here and this happens because here in
14:43:30
the top header there is no space above it right it's right on the edge and we set it in
14:43:37
a way where the logo appears after we pass this section right the problem is
14:43:44
there is no space so let me show you let's say let's select this header and then
14:43:50
here we add a 10 pixel space right and now if we try it will
14:43:57
work all right but this is not what what we want because we don't want that space so
14:44:04
let's uh go back to the properties panel and then let's set this back to
14:44:09
zero so instead what we'll do is uh set this section all right the hero section
14:44:15
instead of the header so we select the hero section and then in the properties panel where it says scroll section we
14:44:22
add a name hero section now let's select the desktop
14:44:29
header and then in the properties panel below effects we click on variant and
14:44:34
then we change the section to Hero section and we do the same thing with
14:44:39
the tablet header we change it to Hero section and now when we preview we can
14:44:47
see how it works and we can see how it also works
14:44:55
in this tablet breakpoint now let's follow the same
14:45:02
steps to set it in the mobile breakpoint so we double click and then in the
14:45:07
components page we create a variant then we move it right here and then we change
14:45:13
the
14:45:20
name now we select the logo container and then we hide it right here
14:45:26
in the properties panel then we select this uh
14:45:32
container and then we set the distribution to end now here in the
14:45:39
homepage we make sure we have the mobile header selected and then in the properties
14:45:45
panel below effects we click on variant and then we change this to mobile hidden
14:45:52
logo now let's test it and as we can see
14:46:02
it works however there is an issue if we
14:46:08
scroll down past the hero section all right and then we scroll up and we click
14:46:13
on the menu and then we close it as you can see we can see the logo and it doesn't matter where we uh scroll when
14:46:21
we scroll up it will appear and this is not what we want right we want the logo to always disappear after we scroll down
14:46:29
past the hero section right let me show you why this happens let's go back to the homepage and then here
14:46:36
let's click so we go to the components page and as we can see right here this
14:46:42
button links directly to this header so every time we click this header will appear right after the expanded menu
14:46:48
closes and this is somehow problematic because when we scroll down the page
14:46:53
this is the header that should appear designing for the web often involves streaking a balance between
14:47:00
ambition and the practicality initially I consider a heer that changes the visibility of the logo dynamically based
14:47:07
on scroll and menu States on all breakpoints however implementing this Behavior involves more advanced logic
14:47:14
and custom code as well which might feel overwhelming at this stage instead we'll
14:47:20
simplify the design to focus on the essentials of building an interactive and responsive header as you grow more
14:47:26
confident you'll be able to incorporate more complex scroll logic and other Dynamic
14:47:32
behaviors and I wanted to show you all this because this is the natural course
14:47:37
of Designing a website right like sometimes you have a design and Midway
14:47:42
uh through the development phase you change things as long as the change makes the UI usable and beautiful it's
14:47:49
totally fine before we apply the changes in framer let's update first the design
14:47:54
here in figma so let's zoom in and then here in the tablet breakpoint let's select the header and
14:48:01
then let's go to the main component we right click and then go to main component now let's select this
14:48:08
button right this one this layer and then in the proper spanel we remove the
14:48:14
background color now let's select the header this layer and then in the properties panel
14:48:21
we click on fill and then we set the dark graphite color is the
14:48:28
background now while we have the header selected in the property panel we set the uh border radius to
14:48:35
six now we can see here the smooth border
14:48:41
radius the next thing we have to do is to add padding to the logo right because we want it to have the same padding as
14:48:48
the menu button and to do it we just have to select the logo and then press shift a to create a
14:48:55
frame now the logo is inside of an auto layout frame and then in the properties panel
14:49:01
we press control and then we click here and then we set the padding to 32
14:49:07
pixels now while we have the logos frame selected in the properties panel we set the WID to hug and then we select the
14:49:16
text and then in the properties panel we set it to a hug as well and that's it now we have the
14:49:23
header component for the tablet breakpoint we'll do the same thing in the mobile breakpoint and we'll keep the
14:49:29
header in the desktop breakpoint it is all right so I just updated the mobile
14:49:35
header now it's time to apply the changes here in framer so let's select the button all right and then let's
14:49:42
remove the background color in the properties panel and then let's select these frame I mean this stack all right
14:49:49
the logo plus menu container and then let's set the color
14:49:54
to dark graphite now let's select the logo container this stack
14:50:01
and then in the property spanel we set a padding or all size of 32
14:50:07
pixels do the same thing in the mobile breakpoint and then let's go to the homepage to see how it
14:50:18
looks now let's click on the header to go to the components page and then we can remove the um you know the hidden
14:50:25
logo variance so this one and then this one
14:50:34
now we go back to the homepage and then while we have this header selected we go
14:50:40
to the property spanel and then we remove this effect now we select the mobile header
14:50:47
and then we do the same thing now let's preview to see if everything works
14:50:54
correctly and as we can see everything is working smoothly
14:51:01
now let's resize the screen to check the mobile breakpoint it's also
14:51:07
working very well here in figma I've also updated the
14:51:13
design of the light mode header components now I will show you a pro tip
14:51:18
involving the breakpoints if we preview the homepage in the desktop breakpoint and then we
14:51:24
resize we can see how it quickly changes to the uh tablet breakpoint
14:51:30
and this is not ideal because the jump is too big right from here to here and a
14:51:36
better approach is to create a new extra breakpoint and this new breakpoint will
14:51:41
be ideal for laptops and large tablets and for laptops and large tablets I like
14:51:47
to create a breakpoint that's 1,00 uh pixels
14:51:54
wide so let's add a name we can call it laptop and then the width we set it to
14:51:59
1200
14:52:06
all right so here is the new breakpoint let's move it
14:52:23
here and now if we preview we can see how the jump between break points is not
14:52:29
as big
14:52:34
all right so now we have the homepage completed and it's time to develop the rest of the
14:52:40
pages all right so this is the final design and as you can see here I've added a new breakpoint for smartphones
14:52:47
all right so feel free to also add this breakpoint because I'm a perfectionist
14:52:53
when it comes to uh responsiveness so I wanted to make sure that users that access the website through a smartphone
14:53:00
have a good experience as well as you can see here are all the pages we have
14:53:05
the word page you know the project page the playground the about page the
14:53:11
contact page and the privacy policy page here in the components page I've
14:53:18
also added a new component this one all right for all the different
14:53:26
breakpoints I've also added the links and the link Styles as well and I will
14:53:32
show you how to add links right now let's go to the components
14:53:37
page and then let's add the footer links so we click on this component and then here we can see the
14:53:44
two uh you know footer menu items that we want to link so we select one of them and then in the properties panel where
14:53:50
it says link we click and then here we can select a page or we can also add a
14:53:56
URL if we want to link to an external page or website but in this case we want to link it to the privacy policy page
14:54:04
and then here I have the different link Styles you can create a new style by click in here and then you can edit
14:54:10
these Styles right here all
14:54:16
right the beauty of using components is that every time we update a link all
14:54:22
right it updates also throughout the entire website on all the different breakpoints it basically saves us a lot
14:54:29
of time and know another thing I want to mention is that I updated the uh space between the footer and the content so I
14:54:36
mean throughout the different breakpoints here for the desktop breakpoint it's set to 200 pixels and
14:54:43
then for the tablet breakpoint it's set to 160 pixels and then for the mobile
14:54:49
breakpoint it set to 120 pixels now let's go to the assets tab
14:54:56
right here and as you can see here in the textiles I've added uh you know text
14:55:03
stles for small phones so make sure to add this and then also make sure we are
14:55:10
using um you know the color styles throughout the entire design right so no color codes make sure all like all the
14:55:16
elements that have a color they should be using a color
14:55:22
style here for the logo I've created a new link style because since the logo is a link as you can see here
14:55:30
I don't want it to you know to be underlined when we hover like these
14:55:37
links so I created a new style without underline on Hover and you can see the
14:55:43
link style right here and also an alternative color which
14:55:51
is black all right let's preview the
14:55:58
site so it's fully
14:56:04
responsive and then let's see if all the links
14:56:11
work beautiful everything working
14:56:18
correctly you can see the fluidity
14:56:25
right in this design I wanted to create this structure all right which is like
14:56:30
an intentional misalignment of the different elements because I wanted you to practice different element
14:56:36
positioning which sometimes can be tricky now let's check the tablet in the
14:56:41
mobile menus so right here we can see how it works
14:56:49
perfectly let's check on mobile working perfectly as
14:56:57
well let's now check the behavior of the head
14:57:02
working as intended all right let's see on tablet working as intended as well and
14:57:11
then let's see on desktop
14:57:19
brilliant now it's time to quickly work on the final settings and then publish the
14:57:25
website let's go to settings right here
14:57:30
here we can change the title of the site you can add your name and the portfolio for example or whatever in my
14:57:40
case something like this and then here we can change the
14:57:48
description and then here we will see a
14:57:53
preview here we have some more advanced options and then here we can change the icon of the site we can also add an
14:58:00
image to use as a social media preview all right and then here we can you know
14:58:06
add a password to the site if we want we can add the Google analytics
14:58:11
tracking and also some custom code right here and then after we add all the
14:58:17
information we want here we can click on Save and then here we have some more
14:58:23
options like you know to set the uh domain
14:58:30
here we have the uh default URL all right but then we can also add a free
14:58:35
frame or subdomain in the real world I would never use the subdomain right I would connect to a real domain name but
14:58:43
for the sake of this video I will add a free frame or [Music]
14:58:51
subdomain then we click here and now this is the subdomain
14:59:01
now to publish the site we simply click on publish right here and then when this uh you know
14:59:09
little window pops up it means that the site is published and now if we click on the URL
14:59:15
the website will open and once I'm here I like to test
14:59:22
and see if it works well in the browser right I like to check all the pages the
14:59:28
behavior of the header all
14:59:41
right and finally I like to test the website in different browsers as well and on my phone to make sure that
14:59:48
everything looks nice that everything is functional and that's
14:59:53
it congratulations on completing ment now you know how to design a portfolio
14:59:59
in figma and then develop it using framer remember what I said about developing your own workflow and style
15:00:04
embrace your uniqueness and use it to create beautiful digital experiences don't let perfectionism hold you back
15:00:11
all right progress is better than Perfection designing and developing a website involves many moving parts and
15:00:17
making mistakes is part of the process embrace them because they are completely
15:00:23
normal and essential for growth that being said always aim for
15:00:28
excellence hey what's up in this video I will teach you a skill that can double or even triple your income as a web
15:00:34
designer this 2025 Design Systems understanding how Design Systems work
15:00:40
and having the ability to create them from scratch is what separates okay designers who struggle to Lear paid
15:00:46
projects from brilliant designers who get work opportunities all the time when
15:00:51
you think systematically and deliver Excellence businesses will love you and here is the thing you can even create a
15:00:58
very well crafted um design system and you can sell it you can turn it into a product and sell it for $100 $500 even
15:01:06
$11,000 plus per purchase creating a nice ongoing Revenue stream here is the
15:01:12
content of this video Understanding figma Variables how to build a design system from scratch step by step and an
15:01:19
introduction to component documentation let's begin in this lesson we are diving into
15:01:25
one of figma's most powerful features variables if you have ever found yourself making repetitive changes
15:01:32
across designs this is about to change your workflow dramatically by the end of this lesson
15:01:37
you will know what figma variables are what they are essential for creating scalable consistent designs and how to
15:01:43
implement them in your projects I will walk you through real world examples common use cases and some best practices
15:01:50
to help you save time and stay organized as a web designer before we begin I want
15:01:55
to remind you to approach this lesson with curiosity variables may seem like like a small detail but Ming them can
15:02:02
make a big difference in how effectively and efficiently you work before we continue I wanted to invite you to the
15:02:08
web designers Collective this is a community that I created a few months ago and we are already 700 members which
15:02:15
is crazy and here is where you will find your people other the designers in different career stages and you will
15:02:22
also find multiple agency owners and here in the classroom section you will
15:02:28
acquire knowledge and you will have access to a bunch of exclusive resources it's totally free to join but we are
15:02:34
very very selective with who we let in however applying takes less than 1 minute and being a member can change
15:02:42
your life so make sure you do it and when you apply make sure you mention that you come from YouTube that way you
15:02:49
will have priority go to webdesigners collective.com and join us today it's
15:02:55
free let's continue with the lesson we'll go through a brief introduction so you can understand what variables
15:03:03
are so what are variables variables in figma allow you to store usable values
15:03:08
such as colors textiles or other design tokens that you can apply across your
15:03:14
designs think of variables has central building blocks that help you maintain consistency and make your workflow more
15:03:21
efficient for example instead of manually updating a button across dozens of designs you can link it to a variable
15:03:28
then change the variable and then the updates apply to all the designs automatically and you might be wondering
15:03:35
isn't that what components do variables and components serve different purposes
15:03:40
in Design Systems but work best when used together variables store reusable design values like colors typography or
15:03:47
spacing and are applied to elements consistently for instance a variable named brand primary colus might be used
15:03:55
for um key branding elements like the background of call to action buttons link or Accents in headers ensuring a
15:04:02
cohesive look across the design components on the other hand are usable
15:04:07
design elements with structure and styling such as buttons or cards and
15:04:12
when you update a component all its instances reflect the changes so basically variables manage design
15:04:18
details while components reuse design structures by combining them such as using a color variable within a button
15:04:25
component you can ensure consistency scalability and efficiency in your designs all right so why use variables
15:04:33
number one saving time no more repetitive edits make one change and it applies everywhere number two ensuring
15:04:40
consistency keeps your colors typography and all Design Elements uniform across
15:04:45
projects number three enabling scalability easily adapt designs for dark or light mode multiple brands or
15:04:52
responsive needs number four simplify collaboration team members can understand and use your design system
15:04:58
more effectively figma variables come in four fundamental types number used for spacing values
15:05:05
grid sizes Dimensions opacity levels and any other numeric properties and then we
15:05:11
have color used for brand Colors theme values background colors and any other
15:05:16
color based design tokens and then we have string used for text content labels
15:05:22
placeholder text and any reusable copy across designs and then finally we have
15:05:28
Boolean use for true false States controlling element visibility and managing conditional design
15:05:36
variations while variables can be used within textiles figma typography uh you
15:05:41
know and textiles feature is a separate tool in the design system specifically
15:05:47
for managing form properties like size weight and line height now let's see how variables work figma variables are
15:05:55
organized into uh collections that Define their scope so we have local collections available in a single file
15:06:02
and then we have published Collections and these are uh shared across multiple
15:06:07
files variables support different modes like light or dark themes allowing a
15:06:13
single variable to hold multiple values that adapt dynamically based on the selected mode variables are applied
15:06:20
through the properties panel and automatically update all link references when modified so basically variables in
15:06:27
figma are more flexible than components when you change a variable the update applies everywhere that the variable is
15:06:33
used components are reusable Design Elements when you change a component it updates all instances of that component
15:06:41
except for any instances that have been detached or overridden all right so now here in
15:06:47
figma I will show you how to create variables the first thing we have to do is click on the canvas and then here in
15:06:52
the properties panel but it says local variables we click and then this window will pop up
15:06:59
now we click here on create variable and then color this color will be created by
15:07:07
default and then since this is one of our brand colors we can you know change the name by double clicking here and
15:07:12
then we write white now let's add the rest of the
15:07:18
color so we click on create variable right here and then we click on color and now the new color will be added we
15:07:25
click on the value right here and then we click on the Color Picker and then we click on this color now we
15:07:33
go back to the properties panel right here and then we change the
15:07:43
name now we add the rest of the colors following the same process now we have
15:07:49
all the colors set as
15:07:54
variables now we can reorder them by clicking and dragging and then we can create groups
15:08:00
by selecting both colors we just have to press and maintain shift and then select the other color all right and then we
15:08:07
right click and then click on new group with selection now we have the group here we double click and then we can
15:08:14
rename it for example we can call this
15:08:21
neutrals and then we click on all variables right here and then we select
15:08:27
all these other colors we right click and then we create a new
15:08:32
group and then we call this group main
15:08:38
colors all right so now we have all the colors organized in two groups neutrals
15:08:44
and main colors and now to apply the color to
15:08:49
elements is very easy we select the element and then in the properties panel where it says fill we click on these
15:08:54
four dots and then we click on the color you can also apply the same color
15:09:01
to multiple Elements by selecting them and then here in the properties panel you click on the icon as well and then
15:09:07
you click on the desire color now I will show you how to use number variables and number variables
15:09:13
can be used for spacing size radius and width and height I will show you how to
15:09:18
set and organize spacing using the eighto grid system all right so to set it we click here in the properties panel
15:09:25
local variables and then let's first rename this collection the colous
15:09:32
collection and then we create a new collection we can name this collection
15:09:39
spacing now let's click on create variable the
15:09:44
number and then we can name this variable extra small and then we give it
15:09:50
a value of eight all right so here we have all the
15:09:55
spacing variables and this is a very simple naming convention but you can name them
15:10:01
something like XS s m ml L and so on and
15:10:07
you can also add larger spacing variables if you need to all right so let's apply the spacing variables so
15:10:14
let's say we want to add a consistent spacing for these three cards so let's
15:10:20
select all these cards and then here in the properties panel we can see how the padding is set to 31 pixels and this is
15:10:26
not a multiple of eight so we click here and then we click on medium which is 32
15:10:32
pixels and now as we can see the padding is set to 32
15:10:37
pixels and then we can do the same thing with the space between items all right
15:10:43
apply variable and then we can click on medium or even we can set the medium large and then we do the same thing with
15:10:50
the vertical padding and now as we can see everything
15:10:56
is set correctly now I will show you how string variables
15:11:03
work and strings are basically words let's go to the properties panel and then we click here again and then we
15:11:09
create a new collection we call this collection
15:11:15
strings and then we create a string
15:11:20
variable now let's rename this string and then we add this
15:11:28
value we create another string variable and then we rename it to menu
15:11:36
item two and then we set the value services and then we create a third
15:11:42
one for menu item three and then we add
15:11:47
contact SD value now we select menu item one and
15:11:54
then here in the properties panel where it says text we click on this icon and then we apply this variable this
15:12:01
one now we do the same thing with menu item
15:12:11
two and then the same thing with menu idem
15:12:22
three and the same thing with the menu items in the
15:12:27
footer we select these this variable and then now
15:12:33
this we select this variable and now here we also apply this
15:12:42
variable and now we have all the variables
15:12:48
applied and now if we open the variables panel and then we change this value
15:12:55
to portfolio for example we can see how it changes
15:13:04
everywhere now I will show you how to create light mode and dark mode components using variables so here we
15:13:10
have the light mode component and then here we have the dark mode component instead of using two components one for
15:13:16
each mode we can use a single component and then toggle between light mode and dark
15:13:21
mode all right so let's create a new variable collection and then we can name It theme
15:13:31
now we create a new color variable and then we name this variable
15:13:41
background now let's create a new mode by clicking here and then we name this
15:13:49
mode light and then this one dark now
15:13:54
let's change this color with the Color Picker and then this
15:14:01
background I've created all the rest of the color variables right here as you can see for the light mode and then for
15:14:08
the dark mode all right and now what we have to do is apply those color variables to this
15:14:17
component so let's select this component and then in the properties
15:14:22
panel we change this we click and then we click on the variable which in this
15:14:29
this case right here where it says theme is the background we should do the same thing
15:14:35
with the shape and then the
15:14:45
text and then the bottom
15:14:52
background and then the button text
15:15:01
oh and we can't forget the stroke as well so let's set
15:15:09
it and now let's select the component and then here in the properties panel
15:15:14
right next to appearance we'll see this icon all right so we click and now we can choose between light mode and then
15:15:21
dark mode all right
15:15:29
now I will show you how to use number variables to set sizes let's say we want to make this card wider we can do it by
15:15:37
adding the new size here or we can do it more systematically with
15:15:43
variables so it's always we set a variable by clicking here and then we create a new
15:15:51
collection we can name these collection
15:15:57
sizes now let's create a collection we name the collection
15:16:04
card and then we create a number variable now we name this with we right
15:16:11
click we duplicate it and then this one
15:16:16
hide the value for this will be 320 and then this one
15:16:24
360 now let's group them and then we name this group product
15:16:35
card now let's apply the variable so we select this Frame and then here in the properties
15:16:42
panel we click here and then apply variable and then we click on width we
15:16:48
can see the change applied and then we do the same thing with the
15:16:56
height all right so now we have have the width and the height variable
15:17:04
supply all right now let's explore Boolean variables and Boolean basically means yes or no true or false so for
15:17:11
example do we want these Tri angles to appear yes or no right Boolean variables
15:17:17
in figma are typically used in prototypes and Design Systems to control the visibility state or behavior of
15:17:23
components they help create Dynamic interactive designs by toggling specific Properties or on or off so let's create
15:17:30
a Boolean variable by clicking here as always and then we create a collection we call this collection
15:17:38
shapes and then we click on create variable right here and we click on
15:17:44
Boolean now we change the name to Triangle for
15:17:50
example then we change the value to True by clicking
15:17:55
here now let's apply the Boolean variable to this two triangles right so we select the two
15:18:02
triangles and then here in the properties panel where it says appearance we right click on this I icon
15:18:09
right and then you will see the variable right here then click now let's open the variables
15:18:17
panel and now when we toggle this on and off we can see how the triangles appear
15:18:23
and disappear so this is a Boolean variable all right now let's talk talk
15:18:28
about aliasing aliasing variables in figma means reusing or linking one variable to another instead of creating
15:18:36
duplicates so this is how it works let's say we have this box of crayons right and then we want to color multiple
15:18:44
elements right with this color so instead of using three crayons for example one for each of these elements
15:18:52
we would use a single crayon all right to color these three elements in Design
15:18:58
Systems we call these main colors primitive variables and they are the base values the colors link to these
15:19:05
Primitives like the ones used for buttons titles or backgrounds are called semantic variables these semantic
15:19:11
variables give The Primitives a specific role or purpose in the design all right I will show you how it works so here we
15:19:17
have the colors we said earlier all right and these colors will be our
15:19:24
primitive colors
15:19:30
and I've created a new collection named brand colors and these colors will be
15:19:36
are semantic colors so the semantic colors represent the intention of use and then the
15:19:44
Primitive colors represent the value all right so here in our Primitives we have
15:19:53
this royal blue all right and we have the value and then if we go to the semantic colors which are the colors
15:19:59
we'll actually use in the design we can see the intention of use all
15:20:05
right this one is going to be used as a primary color this one as a secondary color this one for the buttons and then
15:20:12
for the background and then for the text and now instead of using this color as a secondary color let's say we want
15:20:19
to use the royal blue we said in The Primitives so instead of changing the color here we right click and then we
15:20:26
create an alas right and now we scroll down until we see the Primitive color we want this one in this case and then we
15:20:33
click and now they are linked now I've also linked this primary
15:20:40
color to the Primitive okay now let's apply the semantic colors to this crayons so in the properties panel we
15:20:48
click here and then libraries and then primary and then we do the same thing
15:20:55
with the blue crayon
15:21:01
now we have these crayons linked to the semantics and therefore to The Primitives now I've added a new element
15:21:09
all right and these two elements the cryon and this Arrow are linked to the same semantic
15:21:15
variable and now let's say instead of using royal blue we want to use
15:21:22
cinnamon all elements linked to that semantic variable will change and now let's say say that
15:21:29
instead of using cinnamon you want to change the color of the Primitive variable because you want all the
15:21:34
elements linked to that primitive variable to change their color to Sunflower yellow for example we don't
15:21:41
have to change anything in the semantic variable all right we go to the
15:21:47
Primitive and then here we can change the color to Sunflower
15:21:56
yellow and then when we go back to the semantic we can see how it's updated
15:22:02
right here and also we can see the elements
15:22:07
updated with this new color don't worry if this is still a
15:22:13
little bit uh confusing because in the next lesson you will see how alias in variables work in practice since we'll
15:22:20
create a small design system from scratch in this lesson you've learned
15:22:25
what figma variables and modes are the different types of variables how to create variables and modes and also what
15:22:32
aliasing is and how to create aliases now it's time to move to the next lesson in this lesson we are diving into Design
15:22:39
Systems the backbone of consistency efficiency and scalability in modern design workflows you will learn how to
15:22:46
create a simple design system using Brad Frost Atomic design framework which breaks everything down into clear
15:22:53
reusable Parts atoms molecules and organisms we'll start by building
15:22:58
foundational elements like colors typography and spacing known as atoms then you will learn how to combine those
15:23:05
atoms into components known as molecules things like bonds for example and finally we'll organize molecules into
15:23:12
larger more functional components called organisms such as cards or navigation
15:23:17
bars let's get started so what is a design system a design system is a
15:23:22
collection of reusable components guidelines and design assets that help teams create consistent and scalable
15:23:28
designs efficiently it acts as a single source of Truth for a product design and
15:23:34
development so inside of a design system we have different elements and based on
15:23:40
the atomic design system we have atoms all right which are foundational items like colors topography spacing and icons
15:23:48
for example and then we have molecules which are basically groups of atoms
15:23:53
right and this could be buttons or input fields for example and then we have
15:23:59
organisms which are basically groups of molecules and this could be cards or you
15:24:05
know navigation bars or larger components all right so I just created
15:24:10
this page in light mode and also dark mode and we'll basically create a very simple design system for it okay so the
15:24:18
first thing that I did was to design this freely okay I wasn't constrained by a system so I recommend you to start by
15:24:25
designing freely without a system to let your creativity flow and explore possibilities and then once you have a
15:24:31
foundational idea refine it and build a design system around it because this
15:24:36
approach balances freedom and structure ensuring your designs are both creative and consistent all right so now we'll
15:24:43
start with the atems which are the design tokens and the first one will be
15:24:48
the colors we'll now create the color styles and we'll be using both color styles and
15:24:54
variables because in figma is a good idea to have both since they were work together to make your design system more
15:25:00
powerful and easy to use basically color styles are like ready made labels for your colors that you can quickly apply
15:25:06
to designs keeping everything consistent and as you already know variables on the other hand are more Dynamic and let you
15:25:14
do things like switch between light and dark them and we can also link color styles to variables and that's very
15:25:21
useful because by doing that we can easily pick from a set of colors and then use variables to handle more
15:25:27
advanced changes like the updates okay so let's create a frame which will contain our colors so let's
15:25:32
press F on our keyboard and then let's draw a frame something like this for now
15:25:38
we can now rename the frame to Colors now let's select this
15:25:46
Frame and then in the properties panel right here where it says selection colors we'll see all the colors we used
15:25:52
and we will not use pure black so this one we can change it to this color and
15:25:57
then it's going to un ify with the other one we had below right and now we'll create color styles for each of
15:26:05
these and to create the color style we basically click on the color right here
15:26:10
and then we click this plus sign and then we click on style and then here we
15:26:16
can add a name this one will be black all right and then we click on create
15:26:22
style and now we have our style created now follow the same process to
15:26:29
complete all the other color styles like I did all right now let's create some shapes that will contain our color so
15:26:36
here we select this Frame all right and then we press F on our keyboard and then we draw a small frame
15:26:44
something like this for now then we select the
15:26:49
frame here in the properties panel we click on fill and then let's apply a color style black
15:26:59
now while we have the shape selected we go to the properties panel again we click on the color
15:27:05
style and then we click here edit style and then we copy the color
15:27:11
code now we go back to the shape we press t on our keyboard we click and
15:27:17
then we paste the code like
15:27:23
this we place it right here for now let's select the color code then we
15:27:30
change the color to Black and then we move it
15:27:42
here now let's make a copy of this text and then we write the color
15:27:49
name now let's organize it so we press and maintain shift we select the color code and then we press shift a to
15:27:55
activate our layout and then while we have this selected we select the shape while we press and maintain shift and
15:28:02
then we activate Auto layout now let's select the color name and then we press the up arrow on
15:28:08
our keyboard now let's select this
15:28:14
Frame and then in the properties panel we align it to the left now we select this nested
15:28:22
frame and then we change the space into 8 pixels now let's style this frame a
15:28:29
little bit so we select it and then in the properties panel we set the corner radius to
15:28:36
six it's just like a small detail it's basically the same Corner radius we are
15:28:41
using in the design now we select this Frame and then we press alt on our keyboard and then we drag to make a copy
15:28:49
all right now we select this Frame and then in the property panel we select the next color which is this
15:28:56
one now we copy the color code so right here we copy the
15:29:03
code and then we paste it here all right so if this happens we
15:29:10
select this Frame all right and then we set it to field container let's do the
15:29:17
same thing
15:29:22
here and then let's change the name of the color
15:29:32
all right so here we have our colors and now we'll organize them normally we would have many
15:29:39
different categories for our colors like primary secondary neutral Shades and so on but for this example we want to keep
15:29:47
it simple and we will only categorize them in two groups primary and secondary the title on this one is too
15:29:54
long and I don't want it to occupy on three lines so I will select all the
15:30:00
text and then in the properties panel I will change the text size to
15:30:09
18 now let's organize them all right so here we have our primary colors and then here we have our
15:30:16
secondary colors now we have to add an extra color and it's basically this dark
15:30:22
graphite color that we are using here in the dark mode so let's create the color
15:30:38
style now let's make a copy of this color all
15:30:43
right and then we select this Frame and then since I have Auto layout activated
15:30:48
here I will go to the properties panel and then click on wrap
15:30:58
now we select this Frame and then here in the properties panel we apply the dark graphite color and then we copy the
15:31:05
color code and we paste it
15:31:15
here we change the color
15:31:20
name and that's it all right so we have our
15:31:26
colors now let's work on the next item the typography I've created this black page
15:31:33
so we have a little bit more of um you know text size variety all right and now
15:31:39
let's create the um text stles so the first textile we'll create is the
15:31:45
display textile and this textile is basically used for prominent and you
15:31:50
know attention grabbing text like this right so let's select this text then
15:31:57
here in the properties panel right next to typography we click on these four dots and then this plus sign and here we
15:32:04
add the name in this case display desktop and if we click
15:32:10
here on show more options we can see all the settings let's change the line
15:32:15
height to 120% and then create style now when we click on the canvas we
15:32:22
can see here in the properties panel the text stle created all right now let's apply the text stle to
15:32:29
this text as well so we select it and then in the properties panel we click this for Dots right next to typography
15:32:35
and then we click on the um textile now let's create the H1 textile
15:32:41
for the uh title so we select this title and then in the properties panel we follow the same
15:32:54
process 120% and then create each time now let's click on the canvas and
15:33:02
we can see how we have the Tex stle created I will actually change the weight of the
15:33:08
font so here to regular and then this
15:33:18
one as
15:33:24
well I'm not going to apply the textiles and updates here because we'll basically use variables all right to toal on and
15:33:32
off light and dark mode and we'll use this design as a reference only all right so I've added the rest of
15:33:40
the textiles here so if you are following along feel free to create them
15:33:46
now let's create a frame right here something like
15:33:53
this and then we press t on our keyboard and then we write display let
15:34:02
stop H1 and then the rest of the textiles all right so now we have all
15:34:08
the textiles here and we'll basically select them one by one right we select one and then we go to the properties
15:34:15
panel and we set the correct Tex stle now let's move this here a little bit
15:34:20
and then let's select this move it down then select them all
15:34:26
and then activate Auto layout then select this Frame and then activate our layout as well now let's resize it
15:34:34
like this then let's set a 40 pixel padding and then let's continue setting
15:34:41
the textiles all right so I've set the textiles here and now we have to reorder
15:34:46
them because this one is actually smaller than these two and then this one is the smallest so this one should stay
15:34:53
here as you can see here we are using two different textiles all right that share the same size and you might be
15:34:59
wondering why why not use only one okay so even if these two textiles have the
15:35:05
same size they are used for different purposes and in the future we might want to change one of them all right and we
15:35:11
don't want that change to affect the other one so that's why we separate them let's change the name of this
15:35:21
Frame and now we have the colors and then we have the typography the next
15:35:27
thing is spacing all right so here we have the spacing we'll use and since you have
15:35:33
access to this figma file feel free to replicate it all right now it's time to create the grid let's select this
15:35:42
Frame and we can see the grid we are using right here so we click and then we can see here the information and now we
15:35:49
will add this grid to our design system all right so here we have the
15:35:55
desktop grid okay here here is the information and this is very easy to
15:36:00
replicate so feel free to do it and make sure you create a style for this grid
15:36:06
all right so now it's time to add the logo to our design system and this is basically a you know like a placeholder
15:36:13
logo all right that I just created for this example and this is currently text
15:36:19
so we will select it and then right click and then copy it as SVG all right
15:36:27
and now let's paste it somewhere around here and now since this logo is
15:36:35
basically an SVG item we can resize it so we press shift to maintain the aspect
15:36:40
ratio and then we resize it let's make it smaller something like
15:36:45
this for now all right so here we have the logo you know the dark mode logo and then the
15:36:52
light mode logo here we have the size and then here we have the color and then the break point
15:36:58
now let's copy this logo all right and then let's paste it here inside of the
15:37:05
header we move it here we remove this logo okay great so I noticed that this
15:37:12
button is not correctly set because it doesn't have aut layout but no worries because we'll fix it right
15:37:18
now okay the next thing we will add to our design system is the corner radius
15:37:23
all right so here we have the corner radius and usually when these in a website we would have different Corner
15:37:30
radius values depending on the size of the element because let's say we apply this corner radius to a smaller element
15:37:36
like something like this as we can see all right the corner radius is to
15:37:42
pronounce okay and maybe we would add a corner radius of two
15:37:47
pixels all right but for the sake of this um you know example I will just use one value
15:37:56
which is six all right so now let's add the last item of this design system which are the
15:38:02
icons and for this example I will only use one icon because that's enough for
15:38:07
you to understand how it works all right so here we have the icon and this is an SVG um image so when I
15:38:16
basically resize it we can see how it stays crisp all right so make sure that
15:38:23
every time you import an icon it's in SVG format okay so now while I have this Frame
15:38:30
selected I will activate all layout then I will set the padding to
15:38:36
zero now let's set the frame to hug hug
15:38:42
right now let's select the arrow which is the vector that's inside of the frame all right this
15:38:48
one and then let's click here in the properties panel to maintain the aspect ratio and then let's set the height to
15:38:55
32 pixels now we make a copy right of this uh icon
15:39:04
and then we select the arrow and this Arrow will have a height
15:39:09
of 24 pixels okay so I created two extra icons
15:39:15
and this one the largest one has a height of 32 pixels then this one a
15:39:23
height of 24 pixels this one 20 pixels and then this one 16
15:39:30
pixels so here we have the icons right it's basically this single icon in different
15:39:36
sizes all right so I quickly created two more breakpoints all right the tablet breakpoint and then the mobile
15:39:43
breakpoint and I've also added the grd for the tablet breakpoint and then the
15:39:49
mobile breakpoint and as well as the typography all right and then the logo as
15:39:54
well all right and we have all the items
15:39:59
if you are following along make sure to replicate all these okay and here um I
15:40:05
don't know if you notice but here I've added the margin right here okay that's
15:40:10
why this is slightly different okay but the value is still the same the next step is to create the
15:40:17
individual components and we'll basically create a component for the icon and then a
15:40:23
component for the logo before we continue I wanted to create the dark mode version of this um
15:40:30
you know icon and then the light mode version as well it doesn't really really matter because at the end of the day we'll use variables but I wanted to have
15:40:38
this here as a reference we will use variants for the different sizes and then we'll use variables for the
15:40:43
different colors so one for dark mode and then another one for light mode and you might be wondering why not
15:40:49
use variables for both and that's because figma has a limitation with the
15:40:55
aspect ratio so so basically when we create a variable for an icon and then we want to resize it we have to set the
15:41:03
WID and then the height individually all right and that's not ideal and I think that figma is working
15:41:11
to overcome this limitation but for now the best approach is to create variants
15:41:16
for the different sizes and then variables to switch between
15:41:21
colors okay this is what I mean so here we have this component all right and
15:41:27
then here we have a variable which is the icon height okay and each of these values represent a size now if I go here
15:41:35
in the properties panel and then I apply the variable and then try to switch to a
15:41:41
different size it doesn't automatically maintain the aspect ratio okay as we can
15:41:47
see here all right and then if I switch to a smaller size we can see how this is not
15:41:55
ideal the the ideal thing would be to be able to maintain the aspect ratio automatically as we resize the icon with
15:42:02
variables but as I said figma is always um you know updating their software and
15:42:07
adding new features so check it out because maybe by the time you are watching this video theyve already um
15:42:13
added that feature okay so let's continue by creating the components let's create a
15:42:20
new page for this all right we call this page components then we go back to the
15:42:26
design system page now let's select the
15:42:32
icon make sure you select this Frame all right and then let's press and maintain
15:42:38
alt on our keyboard and then let's create a duplicate now let's do the same thing
15:42:44
with the logo so make sure you select this um
15:42:50
frame and then we press alt on our keyboard and then we create a duplicate let's move it here
15:42:57
let's select both then copy them we go to the
15:43:03
components page and then we place them
15:43:08
here now let's uh select the icon and then we create a component and then we
15:43:14
do the same thing with the logo we can rename them something like
15:43:23
this and then this one as well
15:43:30
and now we'll have the components here in the assets tab all
15:43:35
right the next thing we have to do is create the variance all right for the um
15:43:41
for this icon so let's go back to the design system page and then we select
15:43:47
this Frame all right and then we copy this as a PNG we go back to the components
15:43:55
page and then we paste it here all right let's move
15:44:02
it let's resize it maybe swap okay now let's select the icon and
15:44:11
then let's move it up a little bit right here and then we right click
15:44:17
and then we go to main component and then we add a
15:44:24
variant now let's resize these icon and you have to make sure that uh you
15:44:30
know the vector has these uh activated all right
15:44:35
to maintain the aspect ratio okay and then the container should be
15:44:42
set to hug hug because when we resize the vector right we want the um you know
15:44:49
this Frame to also resize automatically so now let's select the
15:44:55
vector and then then let's change the height to 24
15:45:04
pixels now let's rename this variant and when we double click we can see how it says property one equals variant 2 all
15:45:12
right so we have to change only this part for now okay when it says property one we'll change it later to
15:45:22
size now if we create an instance of this component Let's uh do it right now so we press alt and then we click and
15:45:29
drag and this is the instance right and then here in the properties panel we can switch between
15:45:36
variants okay as you can see perfect let's remove
15:45:42
this for now and then now let's create all the other sizes so let's move this up a little bit then let's resize it we
15:45:51
select the main component and then we make a duplicate now let's select the
15:45:59
vector and then we set the size to 20 pixels all right the
15:46:04
height and here we have it now this layer all right this frame
15:46:12
has a padding right here and to fix it we just have to set the height to
15:46:24
hug now let's change the name we do the same thing we select this
15:46:33
part that's it now let's create the last one so you can basically press alt and
15:46:39
then drag to create a duplicate or you can click this plus sign let's move it
15:46:47
here as we can see this Frame is already said to hug hug all right so we have to
15:46:54
select the vector and then resize it to 16
15:46:59
pixels that's it let's now rename this
15:47:06
variant
15:47:11
so and let's rename the main component as
15:47:24
well now let's align this perfect quickly by activating Auto layout on this Frame and then let's set the
15:47:30
spacing between items to 32 pixels and now let's do exactly the same
15:47:36
thing with the logo oops I just noticed that I was naming the icon logo so let's
15:47:42
change this all right so now it makes sense
15:47:48
okay and I've also noticed that this icon right here has the WID set to fill
15:47:55
and it has to be set to hug okay
15:48:00
great now let's create all the variants for the logo following the same process so let's go to the design system
15:48:08
page and then we select this uh frame we right click then copy as PNG we go back
15:48:15
to the components page and then we paste it here let's move it then resize it
15:48:22
something like this now we select the logo then we make
15:48:28
sure that this layer right the uh main container has the width set to hug and
15:48:36
then the height set to hug as well we can already rename
15:48:42
this to now to logo 32 pixels and I'm using an M Dash
15:48:50
but you can use a hyphone if you want or a space whatever you want
15:48:57
now let's select this component and then let's click this plus sign to add a variant let's resize
15:49:05
this we move the variant here we make sure that it's set to hug hug okay and
15:49:12
then we select the vector and we resize the height to 24
15:49:20
pixels now let's change the name
15:49:28
and then let's create the last variant we do the same thing we select
15:49:34
the vector and then here we change these to 20 pixels this
15:49:40
time and then we change the
15:49:49
name now let's select this Frame okay and then we activate UT layout out
15:49:57
and we set this space into 32 pixels now let's duplicate the default variant and
15:50:04
then let's see if it works right here we change all right it works
15:50:14
perfectly let's remove this and then
15:50:23
this and now we have our two first components let's go back to the design
15:50:30
system page we can remove this
15:50:35
already and now it's time to create our molecules and the first molecule will
15:50:42
create is a button specifically this button okay and
15:50:47
obviously the text will be centered all right I'll rearrange the atoms here okay and then we will place
15:50:55
the molecules right here and no worries because we will basically reorganize this later on so it looks nice and clean
15:51:03
all right so let's select this button and then let's duplicate it right
15:51:09
here now let's select it and then let's activate Auto layout now let's select this
15:51:15
button and then here in the properties panel we can see that it has a height of 64 pixels so we'll apply that height to
15:51:23
this button 64 four and then we'll add a padding on
15:51:30
each side of 24 pixels and then a padding to the top and
15:51:37
the bottom of 16 pixels so this button is our first
15:51:43
molecule now I've added the button here in the tablet break point and it's slightly smaller okay and this will be a
15:51:53
variant now let's turn this button into a
15:51:59
component and then let's add a variant since we want the properties of
15:52:06
this button applied to this button we can just select this button right and
15:52:12
then we right click and then copy paste as and then we click on copy properties
15:52:18
all right and now we select this variant and then we right click and then copy paste
15:52:25
as and then we paste properties okay now we have to make sure that the
15:52:32
text inside of this button is set to button text tablet okay
15:52:38
instead of
15:52:43
desktop now let's change the name of the component so we can name it something
15:52:49
like simple button all right so now let's rename the
15:52:55
variance and and this one will be basically used for desktop and then this one for tablet that's why we'll call
15:53:02
this one on desktop and then this one tablet because this works in this context if we wanted to basically use
15:53:10
this button in different sizes throughout the side regardless of the device we would call this one large and
15:53:17
then this one small right and obviously I would create another one for uh mobile
15:53:22
because here in in the real world when we click on this button we should also show this CTA right when the when the
15:53:30
mobile menu appears so let's create another variant for mobile so we click here and then we click this plus sign to
15:53:36
add a variant and then we select the text all right and then here in the properties panel we change it to the um
15:53:43
button text mobile okay for this button all right we will change the height to
15:53:49
56 pixels all right now let's change the name so this one the default one will call
15:53:58
it simple button let
15:54:04
stop and then let's reorder it we place it here and then this one which is the
15:54:10
one for tablet we move it here then we change the
15:54:18
name and then we do the same thing with the mobile one
15:54:30
now let's create an instance by duplicating this button right here and let's see if it works so we select the
15:54:37
button and then here we change the property all right and as we can see it
15:54:46
works now we can remove this instance and I will actually change the padding
15:54:52
uh you know on the sides for this button okay so it's a little bit more consistent with the other one so we can
15:54:58
change it to 16 pixels and it looks better now now let's
15:55:04
create the different states for this button and we can create a hover State and we can also create a click State
15:55:11
let's start with the hover state so let's resize this now let's select these three
15:55:17
buttons and then let's change the background color to
15:55:23
this all right so now before we continue with the hover State let's select these uh three buttons right and then here in
15:55:29
the properties panel where it says property one we change these two size all right because this property will
15:55:36
represent the size and as you can see it will also update here all right so instead of property one it says
15:55:43
size now let's select these three buttons okay and then here in the properties panel we select the last
15:55:49
variance so this one variance six and then we move it up now we have this organized and then we know that variant
15:55:56
4 is this one so it's basically the desktop button so here we can copy this
15:56:03
name actually we can copy everything and then paste it here we add a comma and
15:56:10
then State equals hover and now for this button we have
15:56:18
the size and then we have the state now let's select this button all
15:56:23
right the desktop button and then here in the panel we have to basically add this to the name State equals default
15:56:32
because this is the default button right and then we copy this and then here we do the same thing and then here we do
15:56:38
the same thing and now if we select this three buttons we can see how we have the size
15:56:46
property and then the state property now if we duplicate this and create an instance all right we can see here how
15:56:54
we can change the size all right and then we can change the
15:57:01
state okay we could also create an active
15:57:07
State and also a click State it's basically the same process all right for this example we will only use these two
15:57:16
states so let's see this in action let's select this button and then let's paste it here then
15:57:23
we remove this one now we select this button again then
15:57:28
here in the properties panel we click on Prototype right here then we go back to the button and
15:57:34
then we'll see this little circle right here all right we click on it then
15:57:40
hold and then drag to connect it to this variant and now we change the trigger
15:57:47
to while hovering okay and we have some more options but we'll keep it like this
15:57:52
for now we close it now let's preview this page by selecting
15:57:58
it and then here we click on this play button and now when we hover over this
15:58:05
button we can see how it's working perfectly now we can close
15:58:13
this now let's copy this component or we can cut it by pressing
15:58:18
control or command X and then we go to the components page and let's paste it
15:58:24
here
15:58:30
now let's select this component and then let's change the name of the property to
15:58:37
size the same thing here okay this is already set now let's
15:58:45
go back to the design system page now let's create the first organism
15:58:52
the Heather so let's select the he together and then we press alt on our keyboard
15:58:58
then we drag to place it here now we can cut it by pressing contrl X and then we go to the components page and then we
15:59:05
paste it here now let's convert it into a component all
15:59:12
right now let's add an instance of this logo here okay because this logo right
15:59:18
here is not an instance so let's go to assets right here and then we click here
15:59:24
and then we click and drag this logo right here now we can remove this one so
15:59:30
basically every change we make to this logo right here will reflect here as
15:59:39
well let's change the color of this logo Back to
15:59:45
Black all right so now let's create a variant and this will be for the tablet
15:59:52
so let's change the name here
15:59:58
Heather tablet and then this one will be for the
16:00:10
desktop now let's reorder this by moving these up and then let's select the
16:00:16
tablet Heather and then let's change the width
16:00:21
to 810 pixels which is basically the default WI of our tablet
16:00:28
breakpoint now we can make all the necessary edits so let's select the logo and then we change the size to 24
16:00:37
pixels which is the one we are using for our tablet breakpoint now we can select this menu item and then remove it and
16:00:44
then change this one to menu and then select this button and change the size to
16:00:54
tablet now we create another variant and this will be the mobile variant so we
16:01:00
basically change the size I mean the width right of this heer to 390 pixels
16:01:07
which is basically the size we are using for the mobile breakpoint now we select the
16:01:13
button and then we remove it because we have no button here now we select the
16:01:18
menu text and then in the property spanel we change the texti to the tablet
16:01:24
uh version right this one and then we select the
16:01:30
logo and then we change the size to 20
16:01:35
pixels now let's select the mobile variant and then let's change the name
16:01:42
here Heather mobile let's move the tablet one
16:01:52
up now let's select the component and then and let's change the property name to
16:02:00
size now let's make a copy of uh this variant all right the test app variant
16:02:06
and while it's selected here in the properties panel we change the size to see if everything works
16:02:12
correctly perfect now we can remove this
16:02:18
instance now let's go back to the design system page and this will be basically the
16:02:25
design page okay so we will change the name later but for now since we have this right here okay we can keep this
16:02:32
name for now but this will be in a separate page all right let's place the Heather
16:02:39
right here so let's go to the assets library right here and then we see the header and then we drag it right here
16:02:47
okay and now we can remove this header so we have the component now
16:02:56
now we go back to the assets library right here and then we drag the header again and this time we place it inside
16:03:02
of the tablet breakpoint the next thing we have to do is go here in the properties panel where
16:03:07
it says size and then change this to heer tablet right now here we have it and then while
16:03:15
we have it selected we go to the properties panel and then we set the WID to fi
16:03:21
container now I can see here in oversight and I want know if you notice but this text is larger than this one
16:03:29
all right and it should be the same so let's right click and then click on go
16:03:34
to main component let's now select the text and then let's set the correct text
16:03:45
stle now let's return to the instance by clicking here this is very
16:03:50
nice and then let's remove this header and keep the component and now let's do
16:03:56
the same thing in the mobile breakpoint we drag it here and then we
16:04:03
change the size we set it to fi
16:04:08
container and then we remove this one all right so I did the same thing
16:04:15
with the footer okay so we have this component let's go to the component so I
16:04:20
can show you all right so it's basically the same process so if you are following
16:04:25
along make sure to create it
16:04:32
okay now let's create our second organism which is basically this card all right but first I want to style this
16:04:38
button differently so let's select it and then I will change the padding on the sides to 16 pixels and then set an
16:04:46
automatic um space between items and now this button looks much
16:04:53
better now let's select this card then then we press alt on our keyboard and then we drag this here and then we
16:05:00
create a component then we cut it by pressing control or command X and then we go to
16:05:07
the components page and we paste it right
16:05:13
here now I will add some default text in here so right here I will add
16:05:23
this and then I will change this to title and then this
16:05:29
to something like this and now let's create a
16:05:34
variant select it and then here I will resize
16:05:41
this and this will be our tablet variant now we have to make sure that
16:05:49
this text is set to desktop right now it's set to tablet so let's check change
16:05:58
it and then let's verify this this one is set to desktop so it's good and then
16:06:04
this one is also set to desktop now let's select this text to
16:06:11
confirm that it's set to tablet perfect now let's select the
16:06:17
title and then let's change it to
16:06:23
tablet same thing with this button
16:06:31
text now let's create a new variant and this will be for the mobile
16:06:37
breakpoint let's go back to this page and then let's select this card we
16:06:45
right click and then we copy the properties then we go back to the
16:06:50
components page and now we paste the properties
16:07:00
now we can change the size of the text we change it to the mobile
16:07:07
breakpoint and then the title as well and the button as
16:07:20
well so this button right here is a molecule right and then this car is an
16:07:26
organism what we'll do now is basically create a variant of this um you know
16:07:33
component and it will be styled like this Bon and then we'll place that
16:07:38
molecule here let's resize
16:07:43
this all right now let's move this here and then let's resize this as well
16:07:52
and now let's create a variant
16:07:57
let's change the background color to white let's add a stroke set to Black we
16:08:05
set the stroke to two pixels and then we select the text that's
16:08:11
inside and then we change it to Black now let's choose one of these
16:08:19
Arrow so let's select this one for example and then we press and maintain alt on our keyboard then we drag this
16:08:25
right here and as we can see this is too large so let's select a different size
16:08:32
so we select the arrow and then here in the properties panel we can choose a different size like 24 pixels for
16:08:39
example um it's still too large so let's choose 20
16:08:45
pixels this looks fine now let's select the button and then here in the properties panel we
16:08:51
double click here to set the space between two automatic all right so now let's change the name
16:08:58
of this variance so instead of simple button we'll call it
16:09:08
alternative now let's move this up and then let's create another
16:09:16
variant we select the text and then we change these two button text tablet and
16:09:23
then we do the same thing again and this time we change the text to
16:09:31
mobile and then for the mobile variant we'll also change the arrow size okay so
16:09:37
basically we change it to 16 pixels now let's change the names so
16:09:43
this one will be
16:09:50
tablet and then this one I mean this one
16:09:56
will be
16:10:01
mo all right so this setup works but it's not ideal and I will show you why
16:10:07
right now let's create an instance and then here in the properties panel we can see that we can change the size but then
16:10:14
we have this mixed up right because we have the size and then we have the type
16:10:19
so basically we have to create an extra property that says type and then we can choose between a basic button and then
16:10:26
an alternative button so let's do it let's remove this instance and then let's change the name
16:10:33
of these three uh variants so let's select them and then here in the properties panel we know that we have to
16:10:39
change the name of these three okay so let's click and then this we change it
16:10:44
back to simple then we can copy this and then here as
16:10:52
well and then here as well
16:10:59
now let's select all these instances right the basic ones okay and then while
16:11:04
we have them selected here in the properties panel we right click and then we click on rename you can also press
16:11:10
control or command r on your keyboard and then here we'll see this window pop
16:11:15
up we click on current name because we want to keep the current name and then
16:11:20
we add a comma and then type equals base
16:11:26
and then we click on rename and now we have this new property
16:11:33
created and now we select these three variants and then we press control or command r on our keyboard and we'll see
16:11:40
this window again then we click on current name then we add a comma and then type equals and this time we will
16:11:49
write alternative right and then we click on rename and now if we create an
16:11:57
instance of this button right and then here we can see in the properties panel that we can switch between the size okay
16:12:05
and then between basic and alternative now all right and then we can change the
16:12:10
size as well amazing now we just have to create a
16:12:17
hover state for these variant you might be thinking okay so why this Arrow right
16:12:23
here is uh so close to the text and here is more separated and then here is more
16:12:29
separated and this doesn't really matter because at the end of the day these buttons will be set to fill container in
16:12:36
the design right so it the width doesn't really matter if you want you can do
16:12:41
this right if you if you prefer it doesn't matter and also the space
16:12:47
between items is set to Auto all right so let's proceed to
16:12:52
create the hover state so let's resize this and then let's select these three
16:12:57
variants and then we duplicate them now let's select these three variants and
16:13:03
then let's change the background color to this
16:13:08
color now while we have these three variant selected we change the state to
16:13:14
hover and then let's see what happens if we change the state of this instance
16:13:27
excellent and this is the magic of variance we can basically change the
16:13:32
size of the button the state of the button all right and then the type of
16:13:38
the button from the properties panel and I know that for some beginners
16:13:44
this might seem a little bit complex but if you get it right you will save a lot of time and your design will be cleaner
16:13:53
and whenever you have a question or F stuck make sure you ask in the community
16:13:58
I am very active there and there are other very Advanced designers in there as well so don't be shy and ask
16:14:05
questions all right so let's continue let's remove this instance and then let's scroll down until we see the
16:14:13
cards now let's go to the assets library and then let's click on this button and
16:14:19
then the size should be desktop then the state default and then the type alternative
16:14:26
and then we click on insert instance now we have the instance here now while we
16:14:31
have it selected we press control or command X on our keyboard and then we
16:14:36
select this nested frame and then we paste it here now we have the instance
16:14:42
here and we can remove this button now we select the instance and
16:14:47
then here in the properties panel we set the wi to fi container now while we have this button
16:14:53
selected we press control or commence see and then we select this nested frame here in the tablet breakpoint and then
16:14:58
we paste it here now here we have the instance and we have to remove this button right
16:15:04
here now we select the instance right and then in the properties panel we set the wi to fill
16:15:12
container and now this time when we have this instance selected we change the size to tablet right and then we do the
16:15:20
same thing we copy this instance and then we we select this nested frame and
16:15:26
then we paste it here we remove this button and then we select the instance
16:15:33
and we make sure it's set to fi container now we change the size to
16:15:39
mobile and that's it all right so now let's change the names of these variables so this one is
16:15:46
the desktop one we can already changed the property here as well and instead of
16:15:51
size we can call it device so device equals card desktop and then we copy
16:15:59
this and this one the second one is the tablet one so we paste this and then
16:16:09
tablet and finally this one is the mobile
16:16:17
one now let's go back to this page and then let's place the instances
16:16:24
of the card component here here in the assets Library we click
16:16:29
on this component and then we insert this instance now while we have this instance
16:16:37
selected we press control or command X on our keyboard to cut it and then we select this uh nested frame all right
16:16:43
the one containing the three cards and then we paste it here now with our keyboard let's move it to the left all
16:16:49
right right here and then let's select this card and then let's move it out let's make make sure that this text is
16:16:56
set to desktop now we copy it and then we paste
16:17:02
it here then we select this title we copy
16:17:08
it and then we paste it here now following the same process let's add the other two
16:17:15
instances all right so now we have the instances here and we can remove these cards now let's do the same thing with
16:17:22
the other two break points all all right so now we have all the instances
16:17:28
placed now here as you can see I've added the um I mean I've created these
16:17:34
components okay and then I placed these instances here we can see um here if we go to the
16:17:42
components page so here is the article card and then the page
16:17:48
title and now what I want to do is basically hide this icon right here
16:17:55
in this button and we can do this in multiple ways we could create a new button variant but there is a much
16:18:02
cleaner and organized way to do it and that's by applying a Boolean variable so
16:18:09
let's do that let's go to the components page and then let's scroll until we see
16:18:14
the buttons now we click on the canvas and then here where it says local variables we
16:18:20
click now we'll see this window pop up we click click on create variable and then we create a Boolean variable now we
16:18:28
can rename this collection to
16:18:34
buttons and then we change the name of the variable to
16:18:40
Icon visibility now we create a new mode by
16:18:47
clicking on this plus sign all right and we will rename this mode show
16:18:54
and then this one hide now we click here and then we close this
16:19:00
window now we have to link these icon to the variable so let's select this
16:19:06
icon and then here in the properties panel right next to appearance we'll see this icon right here then we click and
16:19:14
then we click on icon visibility now let's select the icon in
16:19:20
this variant all right and then we press and maintain shift alt on our keyboard
16:19:25
then we select this one and then this one and then this one and this one and we do the same thing here in the
16:19:31
properties panel we click here and then icon visibility all right so there is an
16:19:38
issue that I notice and if we go to this page and then we select this Frame all
16:19:45
right this one and then we click on this play
16:19:52
button when we hover over this button we can see how it's not working as it's supposed
16:19:59
to and this is very easy to fix so let's close this and then let's go back to the
16:20:05
components page and now when we select this button and then here in the properties
16:20:11
panel we click on Prototype we can see how this button is still linked to this uh variant okay to
16:20:21
remove this connection we just have to uh click on this Arrow all right and then we press delete on our keyboard
16:20:27
and now we hover over this button and then we click on this plus sign and then we maintain the mouse button pressed and
16:20:35
then we drag and now we can release the mouse button and then we change the trigger to wide
16:20:42
hovering now we can close this and let's see if it's working let's go to this
16:20:50
page and then while we have these frame selected we click on this play button
16:21:01
again and we can see how it's not working and that's because we have to
16:21:08
basically remove this
16:21:16
connection and now it's going to
16:21:22
work perfect
16:21:29
as you can see instead of basically removing or editing mistakes I fix them
16:21:35
as I Advance because this is how it works in the real world as I always say oversight are very normal all right
16:21:43
because there are so many moving pieces and mistakes are bound to happen but
16:21:48
what's important is your awareness and the problem solving skills
16:21:54
all right so let's continue now we can close this all right so now let's select this
16:22:00
variant and then we press and maintain shift we select this one and then this one and then this one and then we go
16:22:07
here in the properties panel and then we click on the Prototype Tab and now we press and maintain shift
16:22:14
and then we select this connection and then this one and this one and this one and then we press the delete key on our
16:22:22
keyboard and since uh in this design this button and then this button will be
16:22:27
used in tablet and mobile we don't need a hover State because it doesn't make sense so no need to connect them all
16:22:35
right so you might be wondering why we created then the hover States for these buttons right if we are not going to
16:22:42
activate the hover State since they are for um you know tablet and mobile and
16:22:48
that's because we are basically thinking about the future right because maybe we create a page and we want a button
16:22:54
that's smaller than this and we can basically repurpose these buttons and then use them for desktop as well in
16:23:01
that case what we would do we would name them small medium and large all
16:23:07
right okay so now let's select this variable and then in the properties panel we click on this icon right here
16:23:15
and then buttons and show okay we click on show and now we'll see this little drop down menu and we can hide and show
16:23:22
the icon all right now we select this one and then we
16:23:29
press and maintain shift we select this one and then here in the properties panel we do the same thing we click here
16:23:35
and then show this little drop down menu will appear and now we can basically do
16:23:41
the same thing hide and show now let's scroll
16:23:47
down and then we select this button and now here in the properties panel we hide
16:23:53
the icon and now we can see this update applied
16:24:03
here now let's organize our file a little bit so let's select all
16:24:09
these frames all right and then we press control or command X on our keyboard and
16:24:15
then we create a new page and then we'll call this page design and now let's
16:24:21
paste it here
16:24:27
now let's go back to this page and then here I will basically
16:24:34
organize this so it looks beautiful and clean all right so now we have this
16:24:40
organized and clean and this is the logo and then here we have the icons the
16:24:48
spacing the grids the typography all right and then the color
16:24:55
and the corner radius so these are the atems here we have the
16:25:03
design very simple and then here we have the components all right everything very
16:25:09
organized and clean and then now it's time to work on the variables let's start with the colors
16:25:17
but first I will change the names because this is more accurate if we call these
16:25:22
ones neutral and this one's main
16:25:30
colors and this will be our Primitives all right let's create the color variables so we click here and
16:25:39
then we create a new collection and then we name these collection
16:25:45
colors now let's create a color variable and then we call this color
16:25:52
white then we create another color variable and and then this one will be black now we click here and then we
16:25:59
click on the Color Picker and then we choose this one now let's select these
16:26:05
two colors and then let's create a group and now we name this
16:26:13
group neutrals now let's click right here on
16:26:18
all variables and then let's follow the same process to add all these colors
16:26:24
all right so now we have all the colors then we select all of them and then we
16:26:29
create a new group and then we call this group main
16:26:37
colors now we will link the color styles to the variables all right for
16:26:43
example this color black we click here and then libraries and then we link it
16:26:49
to the black color variable and now we can see here how it's now
16:26:55
linked next we follow the same process with the other colors while linking the Styles I notice
16:27:03
that we are missing one color variable right this one so let's create it let's
16:27:08
first quickly create the color card so we select this and then we make a
16:27:13
duplicate and then we call this one cinnamon and then we change the fill
16:27:19
here in the properties panel and then we check the code
16:27:25
copy it and then we paste it
16:27:35
here now let's create the color variable we change the name to
16:27:43
cinnamon and then we select the color with the Color
16:27:49
Picker and that's it now let's link the style to the
16:28:05
variable I will move this color card here okay so we have our Primitives here
16:28:12
and then we have the color styles linked to the Primitive colors all right now it's time to create
16:28:19
the aliases let's close this and then we go to the components
16:28:25
page and now we'll create some pretty detailed aliases okay so let's create a variable
16:28:33
collection and then we name this collection
16:28:39
semantics and now we create a variable a color variable and then we name this
16:28:45
variable logo now let's create an alas so we
16:28:51
right click here and then we click on create alas and then remember that these are our um
16:28:57
primitive colors all right and then we click on black all right and this will be the default color for our logo and
16:29:04
then we'll have the logo in dark mode and also in light mode now let's assign this variable to
16:29:11
the logo so let's go to the components page we can close this
16:29:17
now now we press and maintain control and then we click on the logo and then while we have uh control pressed we
16:29:25
press shift and then we click on this one and then this one as well make sure you are selecting the um you know the
16:29:31
vectors all right now here in the properties panel where it says fill we click on this black color and then
16:29:37
instead of being linked to the color style it has to be linked to the semantic color all right so this one now
16:29:44
we click and that's it let me explain again how this works
16:29:49
so you better understand it if you have any doubts so here we have the primtive colors all right and we can even change
16:29:55
the name of this collection to primitive so it's more clear Primitives all right so these are
16:30:02
The Primitives these are the main colors we are using and we could be using different shades for each color all
16:30:08
right so multiple shades for example like a lighter um Clementine all right a
16:30:14
darker cinnamon all right many shades and then here in the um you know semantics we have variables that are
16:30:21
more descriptive so we have the logo we will also create the primary button and then the alternative buttons and so on
16:30:28
right and then let's say that later on in the future we want to change the shade of the logo or the button or
16:30:34
whatever instead of creating a specific color style right because if not like imagine we have multiple items and then
16:30:41
each item has the same color and then we and then we create a color style for each we would have like a ton of color
16:30:48
styles sharing the same color and then that would make the design system very messy so for for example for the logo if
16:30:55
we wanted to change the shade right or the even the color we only have to click here right and then change it right here
16:31:02
and that's it and it would update throughout the entire design let me make a little demonstration so here we have
16:31:07
the logo right and let's say we want to change this logo to Clementine all right
16:31:13
we can just go here and then change the color
16:31:18
right and now we can see the change apply throughout the ENT enre
16:31:26
side okay let's change this back to
16:31:32
black if you are still confused about how this works don't worry because I
16:31:37
will give you another example so keep watching all right now let's go back to
16:31:43
the components page and then now we create the uh semantic colors for the
16:31:50
buttons all right so here we have all the variables for the buttons so if you are following along make sure to create
16:31:57
them all right and now we'll select all of them so we press and maintain shift
16:32:02
and then we click this one to select all of these and then we group them right and then we name this new
16:32:08
group buttons we can also create a group for the logo even if it's just one variable
16:32:16
for better organization all right
16:32:25
okay so now let's apply the variables so here we select this button right and
16:32:30
then we press and maintain control shift and then we select this one and then this one and then here in the properties
16:32:37
panel where it says fill we change it to to this one primary background default
16:32:42
all right and then now here in the properties panel we can already see that this is the text okay so so let's also
16:32:49
apply the variable which is this one okay
16:32:54
perfect now let's do the same thing with the hover state so we select them all all
16:33:00
right and then in the properties panel we do the same
16:33:06
thing this one and then for the
16:33:12
text this one and now we repeat the same process
16:33:18
with this okay so we select them
16:33:24
all right and then here in the prop panel we set it to this
16:33:30
one and then the text will be this and then here we have
16:33:36
a stroke right so we have to basically create a new variable right new color variable and then we name
16:33:46
it shoke then default right and then now we create an
16:33:53
alas and then we link it to the Primitive
16:33:58
black right now let's duplicate it and then
16:34:05
this will be for the hover and even though it's the same color I will create it just in case we
16:34:12
want to change it in the future now we select both and then we drag
16:34:17
them here and then now here in the properties
16:34:23
panel we change change these to the default one right now let's select these three
16:34:30
variants and then let's follow the same
16:34:41
process and now this for the text now it's time to create a variable
16:34:48
for the icon okay all right I've created the variables here they they are now we
16:34:55
press and maintain control we click on the icon and then we press while we have control pressed right or command if you
16:35:02
are on a Mac we press shift we maintain shift and then we click on this icon and then we click on this icon make sure you
16:35:09
have the vector selected right and then now here in the properties panel we apply the variable which is this
16:35:17
one and now we do the same thing with the icon that's in the hover state
16:35:24
we select them and then we apply the variable this
16:35:30
one all right so now let's apply I mean let's create a variable for this um icon
16:35:38
okay which is basically the main component all right so let's create the
16:35:45
variable we can call it right arrow and then we
16:35:52
map the this to the Primitive black okay and now we create a
16:35:58
group and then we call this group
16:36:09
icons now let's double click here inside of the component and then here we apply the
16:36:17
variable this one all right so so the beauty of this
16:36:24
is that let's say we want to change the color of these icons let's say we have these icons placed in different places
16:36:30
throughout the inside design and and we want to change the colors of all the instances right we can basically just
16:36:37
change it here okay and then the ones that we have
16:36:43
in the buttons remain intact because they have their own alas right and then let's say
16:36:51
we want to change this color we can do so here all
16:36:58
right even though this is too light this color is obviously not ideal for this
16:37:03
but I just wanted to show you an example and now this one remains
16:37:11
intact let's change this back to black all right here is a little
16:37:18
exercise create and set the variables for all these components and the
16:37:24
variants and as always if you feel stuck make sure you ask any questions you have
16:37:30
in the community all right go to webdesigners collective.com here is a shortcut so let's say we want to create
16:37:37
a group for these cards all right in this case this one and then this one right we would create a new
16:37:45
variable and then here we write the name of the uh group first so in this case
16:37:51
cards and then slash and then then the name of a subgroup for example info
16:37:57
cards right and then we press enter and then now we have the group right here
16:38:03
and now we create a subgroup so we right click and then we click here new group with selection and then we change the
16:38:09
name of the sub group to info cards all right and then here we can add something
16:38:17
like background for example and then we press enter now let's link this variable to
16:38:25
the Primitive color through an Alas and something that I forgot to mention is that you can create an alas by right
16:38:32
clicking like I did in the beginning or you can just do this
16:38:38
right it's basically the same thing here I don't know why figma is adding this
16:38:43
extra space here between info and card because I didn't add the extra space
16:38:50
right so but it doesn't really matter right it appears correctly
16:39:00
here here I also noticed that after giving you the example I didn't change
16:39:05
the U you know the color of the icon that's inside of the button back to black but no problem because I will do
16:39:12
it right now right
16:39:18
here perfect okay so let's continue with the cards
16:39:24
here we can create another variable and then we'll call this one article card and then we can place
16:39:33
it here and then this one will be the background and now we connect it to the
16:39:42
Primitive which is this one now let's select these two variables
16:39:48
and then we create a new group and then this group will be called article
16:39:54
cards and then now let's move this group here and now we have these two subgroups
16:39:59
inside of the cards group okay so here we have all the aliases all right and they are link to
16:40:08
the elements that form the components and since you have access to this figma file make sure to create them if you are
16:40:14
following along all right now let's create the corner radius variable
16:40:24
here we have the corner radius and we know it's six so let's go here and then we click on local
16:40:31
variables and the corner radius variable we leave inside of The Primitives
16:40:36
collection so let's create the variable and this time we choose the number
16:40:43
variable and then we call it Corner radius this will be the name
16:40:50
of the group and then slash Corner
16:40:55
radius default and then we press
16:41:02
enter the value should be six and for the corner radius variable
16:41:09
we don't need a uh you know an alas because we are using this single variable throughout the entire design
16:41:15
okay now let's apply the corner radius variable to the buttons all right the
16:41:21
Heather the footer the info cards and then the oracle
16:41:27
cards this is how you apply the variable let's select the component all right and then we press enter now we have all the
16:41:34
buttons selected and then here in the properties panel where it says appearance right here okay we click on
16:41:40
this icon and then we click on the variable now you will see the value of
16:41:46
the corner radius inside of this white square and that means that now the corner radius is applied through a
16:41:55
now follow the same process to apply the corner radius to all these different
16:42:02
components you can basically select them all since they all share the same Corner radius so you press control and then you
16:42:09
hold and then you press shift and then you click to select this one and then you select all these different
16:42:18
components all right and then now in the property SP
16:42:23
panel we apply the
16:42:28
variable now it's time to create the spacing variables so let's go back to the design system
16:42:38
page now we have to create a new group inside of The Primitives okay and then this group will
16:42:44
be called spacing okay so let's create the group and then let's add the extra
16:42:50
small space which is basically eight pixels let's click on create variable and then
16:42:58
number now we add here the name of the group which is spacing then slash and the name of the
16:43:09
size we press enter and then here we add the value
16:43:15
which is 8 pixels and now let's create variables for all these
16:43:21
spaces all right so I just created all the sizes okay and the next thing we
16:43:27
have to do is apply them in the design let's go to the design
16:43:35
page all right so to set the space in variables we select the frame all right this frame in this case and then as we
16:43:42
can see this one has a space of 120 pixels right if we go here in the
16:43:48
properties panel we'll see this space right here then we click on this Arrow
16:43:53
and then we click on apply variable and then here we'll see the variable right
16:43:58
and we don't have the 120 and that's on purpose because I wanted to change it to
16:44:04
80 because in this case I felt like 120 pixels was too large of a space for this
16:44:11
particular area all right so now this space is basically linked to this variable and
16:44:18
then if we change the value of this variable so let's write here on three 300 for example we can see how it's
16:44:25
applied automatically right let's change it back to
16:44:31
80 pay attention because this is very important and very easy to overlook whenever you see a you know an instance
16:44:38
of a component like this for example and we want to apply the spacing between
16:44:44
this uh you know the title and then the button we have to set it at a component level okay so basically you go to the
16:44:51
component
16:44:57
and then you set the space here okay the variable okay now let's apply the
16:45:03
different sizes throughout the entire design and since you have access you can just check the figma file whenever you
16:45:10
are stuck all right so I've applied the spacing variables throughout the design
16:45:15
now I want to show you something so you can really understand why we set aases
16:45:20
all right so check this out when I select this instance right and I select the space here between the title and the
16:45:28
button we can see how it said through a variable to 32 pixels right and then the
16:45:36
menu items have a space between items of 32 pixels also set through the spacing
16:45:43
variable right now let's say we want to change the space between the title and this
16:45:48
button 272 pixels right so we change it here
16:45:53
and what happens is that this space changes right but then this space also
16:45:59
changes and we don't want that right we only want to change this
16:46:05
space and what we have to do create a unique alas for this
16:46:12
space let's change this back to 32 and then let's create the
16:46:19
alas we go to semantics remember that
16:46:24
and then here inside of info cards all right inside of this
16:46:30
subgroup then let's create a number variable and then we can call it
16:46:35
something like title plus
16:46:42
button spacing now let's create the Alas and then we select the desired
16:46:49
space size which is this one now let's go to the component of this
16:47:00
instance now we select this and then we press contrl and shift on our keyboard
16:47:05
and then we maintain it we select this and then this as well and then now here
16:47:12
we click on this arrow and then apply variable and now we apply this
16:47:20
variable all right so this will be our default setting okay so basically we
16:47:25
will have this spacing right here connected to this variable okay through an Alas and if we
16:47:33
want to modify increase or decrease or whatever um all spacing that is
16:47:39
currently 32 pixels we leave this as it is right now connected to this variable through an
16:47:45
alas okay and then if we want to modify this spacing specifically we add a
16:47:52
number value here instead of an alas okay let me show you so this spacing right here is 32
16:48:01
pixels right and then this right here all right between uh menu items is also
16:48:07
32 pixels as we can see here and the space between these menu
16:48:14
items and then the CTA is also 32 pixels and if we scroll
16:48:21
down here we have a spacing of 32 pixels as
16:48:28
well so let's say now we want to update the spacing for all these elements to
16:48:35
let's say to 40 pixels right we would go to The
16:48:41
Primitives right here and we would probably change this one all right to 48
16:48:48
pixels and then this one to 40 pixels and now all elements that have this
16:48:55
spacing between them like this for example will be set to 40 pixels as we
16:49:00
can see and then here as
16:49:05
well 40 pixels and then here as
16:49:14
well 40 pixels now let's set this back to 32
16:49:20
pixels and 40 pixels
16:49:26
now this spacing is set to 32 pixels again and let's say we want to change it
16:49:32
to 72 pixels for example and we only want that change to be applied to this
16:49:37
spacing we would go to the semantics and then we would unlink these
16:49:45
alas right right here and then we would modify these two
16:49:50
72 pixels and that's it as you can see this is now
16:49:57
72 pixels and then
16:50:02
this is 32 pixels and this is the magic of
16:50:08
using aliases okay so now for padding okay we
16:50:14
can use the same values we are using for the spacing okay so we use the same
16:50:20
variables all right let's go to The Primitives and then we can use these values because it doesn't make sense to
16:50:27
create a new collection since this overlap right so we can use the same Primitives and this is for this specific
16:50:34
case maybe in a different scenario we would create the uh padding collection separately but in this case we will
16:50:40
organize it this way maybe we should change the name of the collection to
16:50:46
spacing and padding right okay so you know how to apply this
16:50:53
we have this Frame selected and then we can see how we have 40 pixel um you know
16:50:58
a 40 pixel padding on all sides so we press and maintain control and then we
16:51:04
click here and now we click on this icon and then we set the desire padding which
16:51:10
is 40 pixels okay and that's
16:51:16
it and we should also apply the padding variables to our components so we go to
16:51:22
our our components and here we apply the padding
16:51:29
variables to all our components and variants for example here in this
16:51:34
variant we have 32 pixels on both sides and then 40 pixels at the top and then
16:51:40
40 pixels at the bottom so here in the properties panel we click here and then
16:51:45
we set the variable which is 32 pixels and then
16:51:51
this 40 pixels all right so if you are following along make sure to apply the padding to
16:51:58
all these variants and also here on these frames
16:52:10
okay all right so I've applied all the paddings all right through variables and
16:52:15
I've also added a new primitive variable which is this one let me show you
16:52:23
this one all right so every time you need a new
16:52:29
variable you can just add it here okay and this is the beauty of using variables it keeps everything very
16:52:36
organized and it's still very flexible all right so now it's time to
16:52:41
create a dark mode for this uh design and we'll use variables for that and
16:52:47
variable modes of course okay let's open the local variables
16:52:53
and then here inside of the semantics collection we basically create a new mode by clicking here okay and then we
16:53:02
call this mode light and then this one
16:53:09
dark now let's create a color variable and then we will name the group
16:53:18
pages and then the variable
16:53:25
background here we have it now for the light mode we'll set this to the white
16:53:31
uh primitive and then for the dark mode
16:53:37
we'll set it to the black
16:53:43
primitive now let's test it so let's close this for a moment and then we select this Frame and
16:53:51
then here in the proper pel we detach this variable by clicking this icon all
16:53:56
right and then we click here and then we click on libraries and now we search for
16:54:02
pages and then we click here now here right next to appearance
16:54:08
we click on this icon and then semantics and then dark it works all
16:54:16
right this little drop- down menu will appear and then here we can switch between dark and light all
16:54:24
right let's open the local variables again and then basically now all we have
16:54:30
to do is translate this color so for example if the primary background of
16:54:35
this button is black in the light mode is going to be white in the dark mode so
16:54:41
we change it here this Remains the Same for now and this will be black as
16:54:48
well all right so here we have all the colors for the dark mode
16:54:56
so if you are following along make sure to add them as well okay I've also created a new variable for the display
16:55:03
text all right and then I applied that variable to this text and then this text
16:55:08
as well as we can see in the properties panel okay so let's test it if we select
16:55:16
this Frame and then we go back to the properties panel right here and then we click this icon and then semantics and
16:55:23
then we choose dark boom perfect here is a very cool thing we can do so let's
16:55:30
select this Frame and then let's switch this back to Auto all right now let's
16:55:36
click anywhere on the canvas and then here in the properties panel we'll see this icon right here then we click and
16:55:43
then we choose the dark mode
16:55:50
brilliant now I will show you show you something very interesting you can also use variables to translate your content
16:55:57
for example you can basically use variables to translate this website from English to Arabic or any other language
16:56:05
and then you can quickly switch between languages and I will show you how to do it right now so let's say I'm uh making a design
16:56:13
for a company that's in the United Arab Emirates and they want to see the content of this design in Arabic I would
16:56:20
first copy this page as a PNG all right and now here in chpt I would paste
16:56:28
the image of the page right here and then I would write this prompt can you please translate the
16:56:37
content of this page section I section
16:56:43
to perfect
16:57:01
and here we have the translation and now let's go back to
16:57:07
figma and then let's open the local variables and now we create a
16:57:13
collection and then we name this collection
16:57:20
language now let's create a string variable and now the first text we'll
16:57:27
translate is a research so we call this string variable
16:57:33
research now we create a mode by clicking here and then we'll call this mode
16:57:41
English and then this one
16:57:47
Arabic now we write here the word in English which is research
16:57:54
and then here in Arabic so let's go back to chat GPT now let's copy this word in
16:58:02
Arabic and then let's paste it
16:58:07
here now let's select this instance and then let's go to the main
16:58:13
component now let's select this menu item all right and then here in the
16:58:18
properties panel we click on this icon right here and then we search for
16:58:24
research and then we apply this uh variable now here in the properties
16:58:29
panel we click on this icon right next to appearance then language then
16:58:36
English now this little drop down menu will appear and then here we can switch between English and Arabic all
16:58:46
right now let's switch back this text to Auto right here
16:58:53
and then let's go back to the design page now we select this Frame and then
16:58:59
here in the properties panel we click on this icon right here and then language and then
16:59:08
Arabic brilliant I will switch this back to
16:59:16
Auto now let's create the rest of the variables to translate all this content
16:59:22
and we'll do that by following the same process all right I'm here in the components page and as you can see I've
16:59:29
added some of the translations okay and then here in the um you know in the info
16:59:34
cards okay I'm here in the components page all right in the info cards I've made uh some structural changes and what
16:59:41
I did was basically to separate these text all right and this title so now
16:59:50
they are in a separate text fields and I did this because when I added the translation right here all
16:59:58
right I couldn't add this line break okay this space so I solve the issue by
17:00:04
changing this structure and the other thing I wanted to mention is that in this case all
17:00:09
right for these cards you don't have to apply the variable here okay in the
17:00:14
components page you have to apply the variable in the instance here is where you apply the variables all right these
17:00:21
are the instances so after adding the variable here okay and then the
17:00:26
translation you select the text in this case this title and then here in the
17:00:31
properties panel you apply the variable by clicking here and then you can write itom and then this is the one we want
17:00:38
right now the title so we click and now it's applied
17:00:45
okay we can see it here now if I select this instance and
17:00:51
then here in the properties panel I apply the variable I change the language to Arabic
17:00:57
we can see it's working and if you are wondering why we
17:01:03
didn't apply the variables here all right in this instance and it's because
17:01:09
the header is the same on all pages right so we basically are using the same
17:01:14
information we have here okay so this doesn't change it doesn't matter if this is in the homepage or the about page the
17:01:21
Heather and the items inside of the Heather will be the same okay let's go back to the design
17:01:27
page and then if you are following along feel free to continue applying the
17:01:34
variables all right so here we have all the variables and let's see if it's
17:01:39
working let's select these three frames and then here in the properties panel we change the language to
17:01:47
Arabic amazing and then we can can apply dark mode
17:01:54
too Sensational we can change it back to
17:02:00
English and then back to light mode now let me show you something very
17:02:07
nice so let's create a frame right here something like this right and then I
17:02:13
will change the language of this page to Arabic now I will select this
17:02:19
instance and then I will move it here look what
17:02:26
happens automatically and this happens because
17:02:31
the default language is English right if we select this Frame and then we apply the language you
17:02:39
know the Arabic language it
17:02:45
changes now let's see what happens if I create a frame right and then I set the page background
17:02:53
color variable so this
17:02:59
one and then I activate the dark mode Let's see what happens if I start
17:03:05
dropping elements inside so this one
17:03:11
whoa and then this one this is amazing and this happens because the uh
17:03:17
components of these instances have the color modes set to Auto okay let me show
17:03:24
you let's go to this um component and then here in the
17:03:30
properties panel we can see how the um you know the the mode is set to Auto
17:03:35
right if we set it to light for example and then we go back to the instance we
17:03:42
can see how it doesn't matter what background color this frame has this instance will show the light
17:03:49
mode let me switch the component back to
17:04:02
Auto okay so here we have this Frame right and this Frame is set too dark
17:04:08
okay and then we have this Frame which is set to light right and then we have
17:04:14
these two instances right and then the components of these instances have the
17:04:20
variable mode set to Auto okay as we just saw so when we move these instances
17:04:27
to this other frame right they inherit the mode of the parent right which in
17:04:33
this case is this Frame okay because it's set to light so basically the frame
17:04:38
acts as the parent and then the uh instances that we place here act as the
17:04:46
child all right and then if we change the mode of
17:04:52
this Frame all right we can see how the
17:04:58
instances change as well and then if we change the mode of
17:05:04
the frame back to light we can see how the instances
17:05:10
inherit the mode we applied to the frame okay now I will show you how to
17:05:16
switch between modes on a page level right so instead of having to select the
17:05:21
um you know these three frames and then switching it here we can basically
17:05:27
switch them on a page level all at once because here we only have three frames
17:05:32
right the desktop breakpoint and then we have the tablet breakpoint and then the mobile breakpoint but imagine we have
17:05:38
like hundreds of pages right and each page has three breakpoints we could
17:05:44
select them all right but there is a more efficient way to do it let me show you here when we click on the canvas and
17:05:50
we deselect all these um you know frames we can go to the properties panel right here and then right next to page we
17:05:57
click on this icon right and then language and then we change this to
17:06:02
Arabic and as you can see it changes everywhere and now if we want to change
17:06:10
the uh mode to dark mode it won't work and I will show you why so let's go here
17:06:15
and then we um change this to dark mode and it doesn't work right and that's
17:06:21
because these frames are set to light right if we set them to Auto we can see
17:06:27
how it changes and now we can change it from here
17:06:37
okay and once you have the mode here right and you want to basically um
17:06:43
switch the mode on one of these frames you can do it by selecting the mode I mean selecting the frame and then here
17:06:50
you can basically apply the mode and it will work why because the frame will
17:06:57
have priority over the page all right now I will show you how
17:07:02
to set responsive typography variables all right so in the beginning of uh this
17:07:08
uh module I'll show you how to create different um you know textiles for
17:07:13
different breakpoints right but this is not ideal this is what most uh beginners do right and I wanted you to understand
17:07:20
how to do it as well because sometimes you will encounter it right but there is a better way to do it and that's through
17:07:28
variables and modes so let's create a new variable collection and then we'll name this
17:07:35
collection
17:07:41
typography now let's go to the design system page and then here we have the
17:07:49
typography right here okay
17:07:54
next we will basically delete all the textiles for mobile and then for tablet
17:08:00
all right we only will uh leave the ones for desktop for now so here we identifi
17:08:07
the last one for mobile which is this one and then we press and maintain shift we click and then now we go up and then
17:08:13
we identify the first one for tablet which is this one and then we press and maintain shift and then we click and now
17:08:19
we have all these textil selected now we right click and then we click on
17:08:26
delete now let's remove the desktop part of the name on all of these textiles all
17:08:32
right on all of these the names should look like this
17:08:38
now and now here inside of the typography collection we create a new
17:08:43
number variable now let's add a name to the variable so we'll first add the name of
17:08:49
the group which is font and then slash and then the subgroup which is font size
17:08:56
and then the first font size which is display now we press enter and then we
17:09:03
have the structure now we create a new mode and then another one all right and
17:09:10
then we name this first mode desktop and then this one tablet and then this one mobile
17:09:21
the size for desktop is 160 and then for tablet is 88 and then for mobile is 44
17:09:29
now we create the next one which is
17:09:37
H1 and then we do the same thing here it
17:09:43
is and now it's time to do the same thing with the rest of the
17:09:49
sizes okay so here we have all the Fone sizes all right and the next thing we
17:09:55
have to do is create a new variable and this time it should be a string
17:10:00
variable and then this one will be for def font family so we create the subgroup and then we write
17:10:07
enter and then we press enter here we have
17:10:14
it sorry here we shouldn't add the um Fone family name right here we should
17:10:21
add add title and then here we should add the name of the font family which is
17:10:28
enter and here as well because in this case we are using the same font family
17:10:33
across all
17:10:38
devices all right so we'll use this one for the title and then we'll duplicate it and then this one will be for the
17:10:45
body text and for this design we are using
17:10:50
this same font family for um you know for the title and then for the body text okay I've added the rest of the
17:10:58
variables and as you can see here under font family I've added the font families
17:11:03
for the display text right because let's say in the future we want to change the font family for the large display text
17:11:10
we can do it right here and we have the um you know the font weight here as
17:11:15
well and you might be wondering why you didn't add the line height and I didn't
17:11:20
add the line height because at this moment in time figma doesn't allow us to add percentages here as values for the
17:11:28
variables they will probably make this possible in the future but for now we'll keep the line height percentage value in
17:11:36
the textiles now let's make the text Styles
17:11:42
hold the variables so let's close this and then let's click here to open the
17:11:47
settings of this textile right here and then here where says enter we click and
17:11:53
then we click on this icon and then here we write font
17:11:59
family and then we click on display now we click on regular and then we click
17:12:05
here where it says apply variable and then here we write font weight and then
17:12:11
we click on display and then now we click here and then we click on this icon and then here we write font size
17:12:21
and then we click on display now we can close this now we click on this one
17:12:26
right and then we do the same thing we click here and then we search for font
17:12:34
family and then this time we click on title okay because this is a title and
17:12:40
then we click here and then apply variable and then we search for font
17:12:45
waight and then we click on H1 and then we click here and then this icon
17:12:51
again and then we write font size and then we click on
17:12:58
H1 now we close this and then do the same thing in the rest of the text
17:13:05
stes okay so now these text styles are holding the uh typography variables okay
17:13:12
what we have to do now is go to the components page now let's select the desktop
17:13:18
variance so we press and maintain control and then we press and maintain shift we click on this one and then on
17:13:24
this one and then on this one and then now in the properties panel right next to appearance we click on this icon and
17:13:32
then we hover over typography and then we click on
17:13:37
desktop now we do the same thing with the uh tablet one so we select them and then here in
17:13:44
the prop panel we do the same thing and then this time we click on tablet
17:13:52
and now we do the same thing but with the mobile
17:14:03
one and now the buttons so these ones we set them
17:14:10
to desktop and
17:14:17
then this ones
17:14:24
tablet and then these ones
17:14:33
mobile all right I've just noticed a little oversight and it's that I'm using the same phone size in the buttons for
17:14:39
tablet and then for mobile and I've noticed because obviously the phone size in the mobile uh buttons should be a
17:14:47
little bit smaller right but no worries because fixing this is very easy let's do it right now let's go to
17:14:54
the design system page and then here we can see how the uh phone size for the
17:14:59
buttons in the tablet breakpoint should be 20 pixels and then in the mobile
17:15:05
breakpoint should be 18 pixels let's go back to the components
17:15:12
page and then let's open the variables and then let's update the
17:15:19
value in the button text phone size for the mobile breakpoint 18
17:15:26
pixels and now this makes
17:15:32
sense now let me show you something extremely nice so we have these two
17:15:37
frames right this one is the desktop breakpoint and then this one is the
17:15:43
mobile breakpoint okay and then we have a text with the display text stle
17:15:53
if I select this text and then I move it here nothing happens right but then
17:16:00
let's see what happens if I select this uh frame and then I click here this icon
17:16:08
and then I hover over typography and then I click on mobile then I select this
17:16:16
text and then I move it here did you see
17:16:21
that and then if I move it back to the mobile breakpoint it changes
17:16:28
automatically amazing and the same thing happens with instances if we take this instance and
17:16:34
then we move it here in the mobile breakpoint we can see how the uh Tex size changes right it becomes smaller if
17:16:42
we move it back to the desktop breakpoint we can see how the text size
17:16:48
increases in this lesson you learn learn what a design system is what the atomic design system is and how to use it and
17:16:56
how to create a design system from scratch let's move to the next lesson components are the building blocks of
17:17:02
any design system ensuring consistency and scalability across projects in this
17:17:07
lesson you will learn how to effectively document components in figma making them intuitive and easy to use for designers
17:17:13
and developers documentation in design is the process of creating a structure guide that explains how a design system
17:17:21
its elements and its processes work it includes details about design decisions
17:17:26
components guidelines and the best practices to ensure consistency Clarity and effective collaboration across teams
17:17:34
documentation can be a broad topic right but in this lesson we'll specifically focus on uh component documentation so
17:17:41
basically how to document the technical aspects of individual components to make them clear usable and accessible for
17:17:48
everyone component documentation can be very tedious right and if we have um a large
17:17:56
collection of components it can take a long time for us to really document everything right to make sure that every
17:18:03
technical aspect is clear so I want to show you this plugin that helps us tremendously in terms of efficiency and
17:18:11
speed when documenting the specs of our components to install the plugin simply
17:18:17
click on this icon right here and then click on plugins and widget and then search for specs and then
17:18:23
install this one so click on this one and then click on
17:18:31
run now with the plugin Open click on any um component so we select this
17:18:37
component and then we click on run and now here we have all the
17:18:43
technical specs of the component and everything is very detailed right we
17:18:49
have all the information if we had to document all these one by one it would take a lot of time right so
17:18:58
this plugin helps us a lot in terms of efficiency this plugin is amazing like
17:19:04
as I said it saves us a lot of time make sure to install it and play
17:19:10
with it so you can see how it works in this lesson you've learned what documentation is and how to document
17:19:15
components automatically in figma all right congratulations on finishing modul 11 in the next module I
17:19:22
will give you advice on how to have successful meetings with potential and existing clients thanks for your
17:19:29
attention and I will see you soon hey what's up do you want to discover a key strategy for landing more web design

17:20:23
preparing for meetings conducting the meeting engagement and communication
17:20:28
post meeting strategies and tools to use for online meetings in this lesson we'll
17:20:34
go over everything you need to do before the meeting begins you will learn how to research your prospects set clear
17:20:40
objectives and create a well structure agenda finally we'll highlight common preparation mistakes and how to avoid
17:20:46
them let's get started so the first thing you have to do is to do some research try to learn as much as you can
17:20:53
about your prospect right go to their website go through their social media profiles and even try to talk with some
17:20:59
people that work for that company even if they are not um you know decision makers right you are just trying to
17:21:05
gather as much information is possible try to understand their business by identifying their target audience their
17:21:12
current products or Services any challenges they may have their main competitors their brand positioning
17:21:19
their company size or stage you know are they a startup a small company a medium
17:21:25
company or a big Enterprise and also try to identify their market conditions the next thing you have to do
17:21:33
is to set clear objective many people schedule meetings without uh knowing exactly what they have to talk about
17:21:39
right and that's a mistake because you will waste a lot of time right your time and your prospect time so make sure you
17:21:46
write down everything you want to discuss in the meeting beforehand for example if the schedule meeting is for
17:21:51
the first strategy session uh one of the objectives would be to understand the prospect's vision and also to gather as
17:21:58
many details about the project as possible the next step is to create an agenda and an agenda is very important
17:22:04
because it helps you stay on track and cover everything that's important so here is a strategy session
17:22:11
agenda okay I put together these template so you can check it out um I will leave a link in the description the
17:22:18
first thing we have here is Introduction right and here is when you introduce yourself and then you let um the other
17:22:25
people in the meeting to introduce themselves as well and then after the introduction you proceed with the purpose of the meeting so for example
17:22:32
today we'll ensure we fully understand your goals and create a road map for success and try to keep the introduction
17:22:40
short right like five minutes if it's 7 minutes or 10 minutes or whatever it's
17:22:45
fine but make sure it doesn't uh take too much time okay
17:22:50
the next step is business Discovery and this is when you ask general questions about the business your goal here is to
17:22:57
basically get a general overview of their business offerings and also a very interesting question to ask is uh what
17:23:05
success uh looks like for for their company in the next 6 to 12 months and also it's important to have a
17:23:13
conversation to understand uh their customers right you want to know who their customers are and also you know
17:23:20
what their um ideal customer Avatar and all that stuff because you will
17:23:25
basically use that to create the Persona profiles for the website another important question to
17:23:32
ask is what do they admire about their competitors and what they want to differentiate from in their online
17:23:38
presence and then here we have the success metrics like how we measure
17:23:43
success do they want leads or sales or you know more user engagement and this
17:23:49
is important because we have to know exactly what they want so we can make a better offer for example if they say that the
17:23:56
most important metric is leads we would work on optimizing the entire website for you know to increase the leads right
17:24:03
and then if they say that the most important metric is sales we would optimize the conversion rate of the
17:24:09
website to increase the sales and then if they say that what's important for them is a better user engagement we
17:24:15
would work heavily on the ux and these metrics are related because if you want
17:24:20
sales you need leads and if you you want sales you need user engagement right but
17:24:25
the thing is like some businesses might have a lot of leads because they nail down the advertising part of the
17:24:31
business but then when users land on the website the user experience is poor and
17:24:37
therefore the sales are low so it's our job to identify the problems and then fix them and here we have the next
17:24:44
phases of the meeting we have the project scope then we have the budget discussion and then we have the process
17:24:50
overview and then we have the next steps so since you have access to this document feel free to click the link in
17:24:56
the description and check it out and if you have any questions let me know in the comments so what you have to do once you
17:25:02
access this document is to go here where it says file and then you click on make a copy and here you change the name all
17:25:10
right and then you click on make a copy and then every time you have a call schedule you send these to your
17:25:15
prospects okay before the meeting and try to send it like one day or two days before the meeting if possible don't
17:25:21
send it like 10 minutes before the meeting because your prospects have to go through
17:25:27
it okay the next thing is to make sure that everything is ready whatever you uh whatever tools you are using if you are
17:25:34
using figma or uh Zoom Google meet or blue jeans whatever like whatever you
17:25:39
are using make sure you prepare um you know the software before hand and you
17:25:45
have all the settings and everything is clear uh check your audio the video Everything like your camera because if
17:25:51
not um you will uh run into technical issues sometimes right and that's very annoying like let's say you have a
17:25:57
meeting and then 5 minutes before uh the software doesn't work or your camera doesn't work and that's not ideal and if
17:26:05
you have a presentation you want to share during the call make sure the phone size is right make sure the images
17:26:11
are crisp make sure that everything looks good because the worst thing is to present something that doesn't look good
17:26:17
so make sure you take your time before the meeting to check Che everything now let's discuss the common
17:26:24
mistakes to avoid the first one is not setting a clear agenda and we already talked about this right going into a
17:26:30
meeting without a clear purpose or structure number two failing to confirm the meeting time assuming the client
17:26:37
remembers the time or converts the time zones correctly when you set a meeting inside of your Google calendar and then
17:26:43
you share it with your prospects they will see the time in their time zone however before you set the meeting you
17:26:49
have to make sure you got the time zone right to get the time zone right I always use this website called
17:26:57
world.com and as we can see here we have different cities and we can add um extra
17:27:03
cities for example London and we click here we have London
17:27:08
here and then here we can change the format and now we can see how 7:00 p.m.
17:27:14
in Barcelona is 1: p.m. in New York 10:00 a.m. in Los Angeles 3:00 a.m. in Tokyo and 6:00 p.m. in
17:27:23
London now let's say I have a client based in New York I would remove this and then this and this and if I'm in
17:27:31
Barcelona I will check the time and then I would know that 1: p.m. in New York is 700 p.m. in
17:27:38
Barcelona after I confirm the time I would go to my Google Calendar and then
17:27:43
I would set the meeting at the right time
17:27:51
and then after you check the time in the different time zones you send an email to your prospect with uh I mean
17:27:57
containing this message so something like hey I hope you are doing well and then you follow up with uh this
17:28:05
message the third mistake to avoid is scheduling without a clear goal so basically not having a specific outcome
17:28:12
in mind for the meeting before you jump into a call you have to define the goal
17:28:17
what's the goal so if you are scheduling for a a strategy call you want to close the deal in that call right you don't
17:28:24
want to have multiple calls to close the deal and all that stuff obviously it depends on the magnitude of the project
17:28:31
but most of the times you want to close the deal with one call in this lesson you will learn how
17:28:38
to lead meetings confidently stay focused on your goals and create a positive impression that strengthens
17:28:44
your professional relationships we'll cover everything from building rapport with clients to
17:28:49
staying on on track listening actively and using tools like AI to make note taking simple and effective you will
17:28:56
also learn how to avoid common mistakes that can derail a meeting the first thing you have to do after the meeting
17:29:01
starts is build rapport and it's very easy you just have to um start with a
17:29:07
little small talk to break the ice like where are you calling from um how was your weekend just some little talk to
17:29:13
get the conversation started and if you did some research as you should you can
17:29:18
also complement them say something like I saw your latest product and it's amazing I really like the design and the
17:29:25
whole execution of the project this demonstrates that you've done your homework and that you are aware of what
17:29:31
they are doing it's a powerful way to start a conversation meetings can easily get off topic so it's very important to
17:29:37
gently guide them back to the agenda for example if the conversation drifts you may say something like um that's a great
17:29:44
point to make sure we cover everything today let's put that on our list to revisit later and then you can follow
17:29:51
with uh for now let's tackle the project scope for example when you're Prospect speaks make
17:29:59
sure you listen carefully and show you are paying attention by nodding making eye contact and saying things like
17:30:06
that's a great point and then sometimes summarize what they say to confirm you understand so if somehow they say that
17:30:13
they want a cleaner uh homepage you can say something like okay so you'd like uh
17:30:18
the homepage to have a cleaner layout is that correct this not only builds trust but also avoids misunderstandings so in
17:30:26
a nutshell be a good listener it's very important taking notes during the call
17:30:31
is super important and back in the days we used to take notes with pen and paper by ourselves or we used to have an
17:30:38
assistant or somebody to take notes for us and with AI everything is different
17:30:43
now so we have tools like order or fireflies that can automatically transcribe your Zoom calls
17:30:50
or your Google meet sessions you know they can um summarize discussions highlight key action points nowadays you
17:30:57
can use artificial intelligence as your personal virtual assistant basically by leveraging these AI tools you can ensure
17:31:04
nothing is missed and you can also create sharable meeting summaries for your team or for your clients these
17:31:11
tools allow you to search transcripts by keyword U making it easy to revisit
17:31:17
specific parts of the conversation I advise you to integrate an AI notaker to enhance your workflow and keep your
17:31:24
meetings efficient and actionable here are some common mistakes to avoid during the meeting you have to always give your
17:31:31
prospects and your clients the space to express their needs ideas and concerns
17:31:36
always remember that good communication is a two-way stet number two is mismanaging strong personalities be
17:31:43
ready to deal with strong or outspoken people who might uh take the meeting off
17:31:49
track always stay calm and guide the conversation back to the main topic
17:31:54
basically make sure that everyone that's in the meeting gets a chance to share their
17:32:00
ideas the third one is not taking notes failing to document key points decisions
17:32:06
or action items can lead to misunderstandings later and you don't want that so as I said before use AI
17:32:12
tools or even traditional methods if you don't want to use AI to capture essential details in real time
17:32:21
communicating clearly and keeping your prospect or client engaged during meetings is a skill that can set you
17:32:26
apart as a professional in this lesson we'll explore how to maintain a professional tone explain technical
17:32:32
Concepts in a way that anyone can understand and handle challenging questions with confidence you will also
17:32:38
learn how to manage time effectively so meeting stay productive and on schedule while avoiding common communication
17:32:43
mistakes that can lead to confusion and frustration always communicate in a way
17:32:49
that is polite clear and respectful build trust by being approachable and responsive to your prospects or clients
17:32:56
needs and pay attention to their communication style whether they prefer brief direct updates or detailed
17:33:03
explanations and then adapt accordingly to maintain a good relationship sometimes you need to
17:33:09
explain complicated ideas but keep it simple use examples or comparisons that
17:33:14
the client can relate to for example instead of saying I will optimize the SEO for better ranking you could say I
17:33:21
will make some changes to help your site appear higher in the search results so more people can find it this approach
17:33:28
ensures your prospects and clients understand and appreciate your work because it's simple language if a
17:33:34
prospect or client asks something challenging stay calm and think before answering like take your time and if you
17:33:42
don't know the answer be honest and promise a followup for example you can say something like that's a good
17:33:47
question I need to look into it to give you the best answer can I get back to you tomorrow clients will respect your
17:33:53
honesty and willingness to find Solutions it's way better than making up
17:33:58
stuff you have to always respect the prospects or client Time by sticking to the meeting duration if you are running
17:34:05
out of time summarize the remaining points and suggest a followup for example you can say something like we
17:34:11
are almost out of time but I will send you an email with details on the last two points time management shows you are
17:34:17
professional and value efficiency here here are some communication mistakes you should avoid number one is using
17:34:23
technical words Under Pressure it's easy to sleep into technical language when feeling nervous or challenge but this
17:34:29
can confuse prospects and clients try to stick to simple clear terms especially in tough moments of course this depends
17:34:36
on the context speaking with an agency owner is different from talking to a business owner who might not understand
17:34:42
technical details so tailor your language to match their level of understanding number two is getting
17:34:48
defensive about feedback reacting defensively to feedback can harm trust so instead treat feedback as an
17:34:55
opportunity to improve and to show that you value their input don't let your ego
17:35:00
get the best of you number three is ignoring non-verbal cues overlooking
17:35:05
signs of confusion like a client's puzzle expression can lead to misunderstandings so pay attention and
17:35:12
check in by saying something like would it help if I explain that differently obviously understanding body language
17:35:18
through a video call is a skill and you will get better at it with time but always try to pay
17:35:24
attention in this lesson we'll cover how to write effective meeting summaries follow up with clients to keep
17:35:29
Communication open and reflect on the meeting to find ways to improve you will also learn about common post meeting
17:35:36
mistakes and how to avoid them after the strategy call send a clear and concise
17:35:41
summary to your prospect via email include the key points discussed decisions made and the next steps in the
17:35:47
process for example you can send a message like this via email okay something short and concise containing a
17:35:55
very brief summary and then the next steps stay in touch with the client regularly even between meetings a quick
17:36:01
update email shows that you are proactive and keeps them informed you can send something simple like
17:36:08
this make sure you take a few minutes after each meeting to reflect on what went well and what could improve like
17:36:15
did you stick to the agenda were there any communication gaps learning from each meeting helps you improve your
17:36:22
skills and deliver a better experience for prospects and clients in the future now here are some common mistakes to
17:36:28
avoid during post meeting strategies number one delaying meeting
17:36:33
summaries waiting too long to send meeting summaries can lead to forgotten details and misunderstandings so send
17:36:39
them promptly to make sure everyone stays align number two writing vague action
17:36:45
items action items without clear owners or deadlines can cause confusion usion and delays so be very specific and
17:36:53
finally number three ignoring unresolved questions leaving questions or concerns and address can create uncertainty so
17:37:00
even if you don't have immediate answers acknowledge them and commit to followup
17:37:06
promptly all right so here is my technology stag for meetings I use calendly to schedule calls and then I
17:37:12
connect uh calendly to my Google Calendar to have everything connected and synchronized and then I use zoom or
17:37:18
Google meet for video calls and then figma slides for
17:37:23
presentations I was going to add a lesson inside of this module showing you how to design effective uh presentations
17:37:30
using figma slides but I decided to record a separate video for that and upload it to my YouTube channel because
17:37:37
I really want to dedicate time to create a very comprehensive video about figma slides and at the same time I don't want
17:37:44
that video to delay the release of the entire course so stay tuned And subscribe to the channel if you haven't
17:37:50
already because I will be uploading amazing design content very often okay so I use Gmail for my email
17:37:58
communication and then fireflies as an AI notaker here are some bonus tips the
17:38:04
first one is keep your workspace clean a clean and organized workspace promotes focus and minimizes distractions during
17:38:11
the meeting it also helps you project a professional image when your environment
17:38:16
is visible on camera and if the background that's visible on camera for whatever reason it's not organized or
17:38:23
whatever make sure you use the blur background option during the call the
17:38:29
second one is to drink Mata tea 30 minutes or so before the meeting Mata tea provides a steady energy boost and
17:38:35
enhances Focus making it a great choice before meetings limit to two to three
17:38:41
cups per day to avoid excessive caffeine intake and also avoid to drink it close
17:38:46
to bedtime leave a 3 to 4 hour gap to ensure it doesn't disrupt your sleep and
17:38:52
if you have a high caffeine sensitivity try a regular tea or something I personally prefer matcha because it
17:38:59
gives me an energy boost the effect it has on my energy is
17:39:04
amazing the next one is to do some light cardio or go for a walk before the
17:39:09
meeting physical activity releases endorphins clears your mind and reduces stress a short walk or light exercise
17:39:17
can improve your mood and confidence help helping you approach the meeting with energy and focus and the next one
17:39:23
is to always turn on your camera using your camera builds trust and engagement it shows professionalism and fosters a
17:39:30
stronger connection with others and as I said before ensure your background is tidy your lightning is good and also
17:39:37
make sure you dress appropriately for the meeting be prepared to deal with mean people who might disrespect your
17:39:44
time and effort unfortunately not everyone will respect your time or contributions but try to stay calm and
17:39:51
professional in such situations if this happens in a life call politely redirect the conversation
17:39:58
and set clear boundaries for future interactions and you have to know that
17:40:03
frustration is is very normal you will get frustrated sometimes the important
17:40:08
thing is not to let your emotions dictate your behavior and the last bonus advice is
17:40:15
aim to sleep at least 7 to 9 hours per day proper sleep is essential for for mental Clarity emotional regulation and
17:40:22
decision making so to finish this module I want to recommend you three books the first one the one on the left hand side
17:40:28
is never split the difference and this book will help you learn how to negotiate even complicated deals so it's
17:40:36
extremely valuable the next one the one in the middle How to Win Friends and Influence People is a very nice book that will
17:40:44
help you deal with different personalities and many other factors about human interaction so so check it
17:40:50
out and lastly on the right hand side you see a book called spark and I
17:40:56
already recommend this book in model one but I wanted to mention it again because it's such a great book it talks about
17:41:04
the importance of exercise and how it can help the brain work better and also how it can improve overall mental
17:41:10
performance hey congratulations on finishing module 12 you've now completed all the main modules of this course if

17:41:36
your attention throughout this course remember this is just the beginning enjoy the journey




----



When I first started dabbling with web design about 15 years ago, I knew very
0:05
little about it. There were very few courses or tutorials on the topic and I
0:11
had to learn a lot by myself. As a beginner, you'll probably be stuck around the same notions that I did many
0:19
years ago. And you'll probably have the same questions like how do I pick type
0:24
faces? How do I pick colors? How many colors? What about icons? How do I use
0:29
them correctly? Where do I get them? What the heck is whitespace? Uh how do I position elements correctly? How do I
0:36
size them? Well, that's exactly the kind of information that you'll find in this
0:42
course. But hey, if we're just meeting, my name is Adi Portilla and I'm a web designer from Romania. My goal is to
0:50
help you become a better web designer and developer by creating content that's
0:55
easy to follow and offers great value. I'm a big animal lover and I currently
1:01
have 22 dogs and cats in my care. And uh my god, that number just keeps getting
1:07
bigger and bigger. But that's enough about me. Let's talk about you and how
1:12
this course can help you. First of all, it's a pretty big course. It has 36 lessons uh structured in 14 chapters and
1:22
uh I made it this long on purpose because I wanted to properly cover the fundamentals as well as some common
1:30
patterns in web design. In terms of fundamentals, you're going to learn about color, typography, spacing,
1:37
sizing, and imagery. In each of these lessons, we'll discuss the theory uh
1:43
behind each concept. I'll show you some best practices and also a few tools that
1:48
you can use to make your job easier. When it comes to common patterns, uh you'll learn about the various types of
1:55
elements you can use to design a web page. Things like headers, hero areas,
2:01
buttons, image galleries, contact forms, and more. Now, for each common pattern,
2:07
we'll look at its definition and some use cases, and then we'll apply that knowledge to a demo project. And the
2:15
demo project is a three-page portfolio website that I designed specifically for
2:22
this course. I won't show you the full design process, but instead together,
2:28
we'll design the various common patterns presented in the course. So, for
2:33
example, when we're discussing headers, we'll first define what a header is,
2:39
I'll show you some best use cases from live websites, and then together we'll
2:44
design the header for the demo portfolio website. You'll also learn about uh
2:50
project briefs and wireframes. I believe that every good website should start
2:56
with these two elements because even before considering colors or type
3:03
faces, you need to know about the content of the website. Finally, we'll
3:08
uh wrap up the course by learning about responsive web design. This is a crucial stage in any web design project and I'll
3:16
give you some general information to get you acquainted with the topic and then we'll uh change the design of our
3:23
portfolio website so that it looks good on smaller screens. Uh we'll be working
3:28
in Figma because it's awesome. It's free and it's crossplatform. You can also use
3:35
it in your browser. But any technique or principle that you learn in this course
3:41
can be successfully used in other UI design software out there like Adobe XD
3:48
or uh Sketch or any really any software
3:53
that you plan. Now throughout this course I'll be using some third-party resources in the form of stock photos,
4:01
UI kits and logos. And uh most of these are downloaded from Envado Elements.
4:07
Nowadays, this is my go-to place for these kinds of resources because on Invato Elements, you can get unlimited
4:14
downloads of web templates, fonts, icons, and UI kits. That's millions of
4:20
creative assets already to use and with simple commercial licensing. Plus, no
4:26
locking contract means you can cancel anytime. Check out the link in the description to subscribe.
Course brief and assignment
4:32
[Music] All right. So, as I've been saying previously, uh in this course, we'll be
4:38
working on a demo project and uh there will also be an assignment for you. Uh
4:45
don't think about it as homework because nobody likes doing that but instead as
4:52
an opportunity to um take what you learned during the
4:58
course and putting it to good use to practice. Right? So uh first let me show
5:03
you the course project and then we'll talk a little bit about the assignment.
5:08
All right. So for the course project, we are designing a three-page portfolio
5:15
website for a nice chap called Robert Fox, who is a freelance UI designer and
5:22
web developer. Now, obviously, this is a fictional character. Um, this will be a fictional project brief, but I think
5:30
it's going to be a great example for this type of course. So we need to
5:35
design uh as I said three pages a homepage an about me page and a contact
5:41
page based on a project brief which I'll
5:46
show you very soon. [Music]
UI design vs. UX design vs. web design
5:51
All right. So let's see what's up with all these acronyms. UX web designer.
5:56
What's their deal? Uh how is a UI designer different from a UX designer?
6:01
are both web designers or are they just something completely different? Let's
6:08
find out. First, let's look at the term web designer. Uh this refers to a person
6:14
that is in charge of designing the front end of a website or web application.
6:20
Front end meaning uh everything a visitor sees and interacts with. So for
6:25
example, if I look at a website like Invato Elements, everything I see and
6:30
everything I can interact with like buttons and links is the work of the web
6:36
designer. That includes colors, typography, spacing, the shapes of elements, the information architecture,
6:44
how I get from point A to point B, and so on. This is the front end. The back
6:51
end is where you'll find the engine that drives this whole experience. You'll
6:56
find the code, the databases, the files, and the scripts that transform a static
7:02
design into a functional website or app. Now, the person that is responsible for
7:08
the back end is called a web developer or as it's called in some places, an
7:14
engineer. So uh the web developer is in charge of the back end while the web
7:19
designer is in charge of the front end. I wanted to explain this difference
7:25
because sometimes people employ a web designer and expect them to do
7:30
everything not knowing that it's not in their job description to build a website
7:36
or vice versa. They hire a developer to do the uh design logo and coding. So you
7:43
need to be careful both as a client and as a professional and you need to carefully define your boundaries so
7:50
people can know what you can deliver. Anyway, we're getting a bit off topic.
7:57
Um we were initially talking about UI versus UX versus web designer and we
8:03
defined the web designer. Now let's look at the other two. A UX designer is in
8:10
charge of creating or designing the front end of a website or web app from a
8:16
user's perspective. That means they need to understand what
8:22
users want and what they need and based on that create a seamless experience.
8:28
Right? This is actually where the UX acronym comes from user experience. So
8:35
UX includes things like information architecture, user psychology, usability
8:41
testing, content strategy, wireframes, interaction design, and so on. It's all
8:49
the little things that you never know they're there if done properly. For example, information architecture or how
8:57
the uh content is structured within the website, right? If a user can very
9:06
easily find the information they're looking for, then the information
9:11
architecture is correct. The website is properly structured. So, the UX designer
9:18
did his job or her job properly. Here's another example. Let's say you want to
9:24
test a service or app and upon sign up, you need to fill in this form. Are you
9:31
really going to stick around to fill in every single field? Most likely, no.
9:37
However, a good UX designer will use this form instead because there's no
9:42
point in collecting every single information at signup time. An email
9:47
address and a password is enough for now. The rest can be filled in later
9:53
from the user account section. So when looking at both of these, which one are you more likely to use and complete the
10:00
signup? Obviously, option B, right? So these are the kind of decisions that UX
10:06
designers need to make and often they work, you know, from the shadows, so to
10:13
speak, from behind the scenes, and don't always get the credit they deserve. Uh,
10:18
but they do play a very crucial part. Now, a UI designer is also in charge of
10:26
the front end of a web project, but covers aspects that relate almost
10:33
exclusively to the visual appearance of the project. UI stands for user
10:40
interface. So, it's all about things like color, typography, spacing, sizing,
10:47
shape, and so on. UI designers are usually responsible for taking the
10:53
structures defined by the UX designers and dressing them up with the things
10:59
that I mentioned earlier. So, uh from choosing the shape of a button to um how
11:07
far apart elements should be to uh how thick or thin the headings should be,
11:15
right? And of course they need to do that while also keeping balance and
11:20
making sure that the overall experience of the user is not damaged or
11:26
compromised. So then uh now that we defined what each term is all about, how
11:32
do we use these in the same sentence? Well, it's pretty simple actually. Both
11:38
UI and UX design are two separate specializations within web design. There
11:47
are areas of overlap between the two of course, but in the end they fall under
11:52
the same umbrella term of web design. Uh so it's also correct to say that you are
11:59
a UX web designer or a UI web designer. It just means that you're a web designer
12:05
that specializes in UX or UI or both. Uh
12:11
you can be a UI and a UX designer at the same time, which is great news for you
12:18
because that uh just gets uh or increases your value as a professional.
12:24
Uh, for example, I consider myself to be a web designer that specializes on the
12:31
UI side of things, but I also have some knowledge on the UX side of things,
12:38
which is something that I plan on improving in the future. All right, so with that said, let's take a look at
12:45
some key takeaways. A web designer is in charge of designing the front end of a
12:51
website or web application. A UX designer is in charge of creating the
12:56
front end of a website or web app from a user's perspective. UX, which stands for
13:03
user experience, includes things like information architecture, user psychology, usability testing, content
13:11
strategy, wireframes, and interaction design. A UI designer is also in charge
13:17
of the front end, but covers aspects that relate almost exclusively to the
13:22
visual appearance of the project. UI stands for user interface. So, it's all
13:28
about things like color, typography, spacing, sizing, shape, and so on. Both
13:34
UX and UI design are two separate areas of specialization within web design.
13:41
It's correct to say that you're a UX web designer or a UI web designer or both.
13:48
All right, so hopefully that answered some of your questions regarding these three terms and the correct way of using
13:56
them. Now it's time to move on and start discussing about some UX aspects of a
14:03
web design project. And we'll kick things off with project briefs.
Learning to work with project briefs
14:11
Every web design project should start with the UX part, right? The user
14:17
experience because that's what we need to focus on. Uh even before considering
14:22
colors or type faces, we need to know uh about the structure of the website and
14:27
we need to know who we're designing for. And this is where a project brief comes
14:32
in very handy. So uh for this application, we'll pretend we're the UX
14:38
designer and we just had a talk with the client. Based on that talk, we created a
14:44
project brief. So let me quickly walk you through it. You can find a link to
14:49
this project brief in the video description. So go ahead and download it
14:55
and let's see what we got. So, we are designing a website for Robert Fox, who
15:02
is a 30-year-old freelance UI designer and web developer based in New York. We
15:09
have a little background on him, the companies he's worked for, and we also
15:14
have some contact information. Uh, Robert also provided us with his logo,
15:20
which is an abstract view of a fox, right? Based on his name. Now, moving
15:26
forward, we land on the website structure. So, we need to create a
15:32
three-page website that um will showcase Robert's work, will provide some
15:38
information about his services, and also allow potential customers to contact
15:45
him. So, the three pages are homepage, about, and contact. Next up, we can see
15:51
u a short description of what the homepage should uh should contain. And
15:56
then the same thing for the other two pages. And then because the header and footer
16:03
are common on all pages, uh we can see their structure here. So we need the
16:09
logo, nav menu, and some social media lo icons uh in the header. And in the
16:15
footer, well, we have a CTA or a call to action area and the usual copyright
16:22
text, external links, and again some social media icons.
16:28
Then we move on to the website content and based on the discussions with
16:34
Robert, we created this uh structure and we outline exactly what we need to place
16:41
in the website as content. Right? So for the hero section for example, we can see
16:46
the title, the subtitle or short description. So this is roughly the the
16:52
final copy or content or text content that needs to go into the website. And then on the
17:00
client section, right, we want to display a list of these logos and so on
17:05
and so forth. The project brief kind of gives us all the information we want or
17:12
need to move forward with the project. And then we have the content for the
17:18
about me page, all the sections laid out. We have the
17:24
testimonials that we need to include. And then we move on to the contact page
17:29
and so on and so forth. Then we land on
17:35
the final page which is for the design guidelines. So Robert in our talk told
17:41
us that he wants a modern looking website that would be easy to use by
17:46
anyone and also that he likes to keep things nice and simple and clean and
17:52
loves designs with with lots of white space. And we also asked him about
17:58
colors and he said that he really likes the color scheme of his logo and that he will be developing the website himself
18:06
making it responsive of course. So we do need to make sure that our design works well on other screen sizes. So that is
18:15
the project brief. Obviously I won't uh like
18:21
go through every single piece of it. uh you can download uh the brief yourself
18:27
and uh study it more closely. But yeah, that's this is our starting point. This
18:34
is what the wireframe and eventually the final design will be based on. And
18:39
whenever you're starting a new project, I highly recommend you have a sit down with your client. Ask him a bunch of
18:47
questions, try and figure out what he wants from that website, uh who he is,
18:54
who are his clients, and then put all of that information into a PDF like this
19:00
one, so that you can uh move forward with your project much more easily. All
19:07
right, now let's take a look at some key takeaways from this lesson. Uh, always
19:12
start a web project with a brief. In the brief, be clear about what you're making
19:19
and who are you making it for. Be as detailed as possible regarding the final
19:25
content and include that in the brief. The project brief will serve as a basis
19:30
for the wireframe. All right, so now we have a project brief. We know what we
19:35
need to design, who we're designing for, and we also have relatively the final
19:41
versions of the content for the project. Uh the next step is to create a
19:48
wireframe based on this project brief and that wireframe will serve as a basis
19:54
for the final design. So let's go ahead and do that next.
Working with wireframes
19:59
[Music] All right, let's talk about wireframes. Uh, these are low-fidelity versions of
20:08
your final design. You can even call them sketches. And the idea with a wireframe is that it represents or it
20:16
shows the final content of the project and also its structure, but in a way
20:24
that overlooks any aesthetic decision. Meaning in a wireframe we
20:30
don't care about colors. We don't care about uh type faces, spacing, sizing,
20:37
any of that. A wireframe is purely representing the content and the
20:44
structure of that content. Now coming back to our project, we're still on the
20:50
UX side of things, right? We're still looking at things from a users
20:55
perspective. And because we have a project brief ready, uh we can get started on a
21:03
wireframe. And uh to save a bit of time, I went ahead and created the wireframes
21:08
for this project. And now I'm going to walk you through and explain uh my
21:14
reasoning for or how I made uh those wireframes based on the project brief.
21:20
Let's go. Uh because we have three pages to design, I created a wireframe for
21:26
each of them. And I did that in Figma because it just makes sense. Uh I'm
21:34
creating the final design in Figma. So I'm also creating the wireframes in
21:39
Figma. Uh there are specialized uh apps for creating wireframes. You can
21:45
do a Google search if you want. But I think that
21:50
uh Figma is more than capable of doing this kind of thing. So this is what I'm
21:56
using. So what I did is I went through uh the project brief and I started with
22:04
each section and each page. So on the homepage, right, if we scroll down here,
22:10
we of course have the the header and footer which are present in all pages.
22:15
So, for the header, I know I want a logo, a nav menu, and social media
22:20
icons. So, I went ahead and I just typed in logo
22:26
and then a simple menu with the pages
22:31
and then some social media icons. These don't necessarily need to be the
22:37
final icons we'll be using in our design. They're just here uh to tell the UI designer, hey, this is what you need
22:44
to do. All right. And remember, this is a sketch. So then besides the header in
22:52
the homepage, we start with a hero section where we have a title, subtitle,
22:57
and description. So I took those and I arranged them in a way that obviously is
23:04
not final. I put the subtitle here, the title here, the uh sub um the
23:10
description and then under that because the hero area should also display the
23:16
contact email and phone number and a button. I uh put those uh elements here.
23:22
So, email, phone, and button. Will this be the final layout? Probably not. But
23:29
it doesn't matter because remember the purpose of a wireframe is to display the
23:34
content. And currently this is the content. It's then up to the UI designer
23:41
to dress this up. And he can decide to, you know, align this to the left. He can
23:48
decide, okay, I don't want this button here. Maybe I'll put it below. Maybe I don't want this contact information
23:55
here. So it's not like what you see here is the final version of the project. No,
24:03
the UI designer can also make some changes as long as he doesn't compromise
24:09
the overall user experience. So then I did exactly the same for the rest of the
24:16
content. just checking the project brief, adding content to my wireframe
24:23
without having to worry about color or you know type faces. I just used
24:29
whatever uh type face I had selected at the time which was robboto and the color
24:35
is just pure black. And I did the rest of the sections. So
24:41
here we have uh the portfolio section and this is um where we should put the
24:47
portfolio images. Uh this is a testimonial and this is the footer call
24:53
to action right with its title, subtitle.
24:58
Uh some additional information. Uh this is the footer which contains the
25:03
copyright information, external links and again social media icons. And then
25:11
the about me page has this structure again based on the project brief. We
25:18
have a introduction section here, some images, then some uh benefits for
25:24
working with Robert, some testimonials, some services. Uh these are the tools
25:32
that Robert uses for design and development. And then the footer again.
25:37
And finally, the contact page looks like this. Again, an intro section with much
25:44
more visible contact information, uh, a Q&A, and then the call to action, which
25:51
in our case is the contact form. So, these are the wireframes. Basically, you don't have to get fancy with them. Uh,
25:58
you don't have to worry about how elements look like, what color they're
26:04
using. any of that stuff. You just start putting elements in the page and it's
26:11
then going to be up to the UI designer to dress it up. Now, in case you're the
26:16
UX designer, but also the UI designer, then, you know, you will probably make
26:23
the wireframes a little bit more visually interesting or a little bit uh closer to the final version because you
26:31
already have an idea of where you want to take this project. But if the UX and
26:37
the UI are handled by two separate people, then it's totally okay for a
26:42
wireframe to look messy, unorganized, uh just like a sketch basically because
26:50
again its purpose is to present the content and the structure of the content. Now if you want you can uh
26:57
create your own wireframe based on the project brief or you can use the one that I created. That's totally up to
27:05
you. But if you want to use this one, uh, check out the video description, uh,
27:10
for a link to the final Figma file, and that's going to be there as a separate
27:17
page. Okay, time for some key takeaways. A wireframe is a lowfidelity version of
27:24
the final design. A wireframe should display the final content as well as its
27:29
structure. A wireframe should be devoid of any intentional aesthetic decisions
27:34
like color or typography. All right. So with the wireframe complete, uh we can
27:40
now move on to the UI design side of things. Uh so far we covered the user
27:47
experience, but now we can move on to the user interface and start uh dressing
27:53
it up as I've been uh saying. Uh before we do that though, we need to uh decide
27:59
on which UI UX design software we need to use. So more about that coming up.
Picking the right design tool
28:11
All right. So as we're slowly getting into the UI design parts of this course,
28:18
uh it's time to figure out which uh design software we're going to use. And
28:23
I'm sure this is one of the main questions you're asking yourself as a beginner because sure it's uh relatively
28:31
easy to learn uh how to use a design software, but it's always helpful to know about
28:38
certain pros and cons uh of um all the all the software that's available
28:43
nowadays so you can make the best uh decision. When I started designing
28:48
websites um back in the day, you only had like one option for the software and
28:54
that was Adobe Photoshop. A lot of people were were using it. Um you know,
29:00
a lot of templates that were up for sale were Photoshop templates.
29:07
Well, let's just say that was a painful time compared to today. All right. uh
29:14
Photoshop wasn't and uh still isn't to this day designed to be used for this
29:20
kind of task. Eventually, I moved on to Sketch. Back then, it was obviously a
29:26
lot different than it is today in 2022. I think the version I started on was
29:32
version three or something like that. But just so you understand um how much
29:39
better it was moving to Sketch, I remember this interview with Bill Gates
29:45
and Steve Jobs. And when talking about iTunes being available on Windows, Steve
29:52
Jobs said that it was like giving a glass of ice water to someone in hell,
29:59
right? And that's that's pretty much how I felt moving or switching from uh
30:06
Photoshop to Sketch. It was definitely a breath of fresh air and it also gave me
30:13
a good insight into today's software and today things are very different. We have
30:20
a lot of design software available to us. We have uh Sketch, we have Adobe XD,
30:27
Figma, Invision Studio and a few others. Uh and
30:33
even today, of course, you can use Photoshop or Illustrator to design a website. But do you really want to? I
30:41
promise you, you don't want to do that. Instead, take my advice and use one of
30:47
the apps that I mentioned earlier. Photoshop and Illustrator have their
30:52
uses. They're designed for something something completely different. So, let
30:58
them um be used on those things that are good at but for UI, UX design, things
31:06
like this. Use uh one of the apps that I mentioned previously. You'll thank me
31:12
later. Now, for this course, I'll be working in Figma. Nowadays, this is my
31:17
go-to app for UI/ UX design and for a lot of other things, and I've been using
31:24
it for a few years now. I also made a dedicated course on the topic that digs
31:29
a lot deeper, and you can find a link to that down below. Now, obviously, you're
31:34
free to use any design software you want, but if you're still on the fence about this, I would highly recommend you
31:41
take a look at Figma. It's very easy to use. Um, it works in the browser, it's
31:47
cross-platform, it has all the features you need for web design. Oh, and it's
31:53
also free. So, five great reasons for using Figma. Sketch is also a great
32:00
option, but it's a paid app and only works on Mac OS. Adobe XD is also very
32:06
popular and works on both Mac OS and Windows. Uh, it's free and it has some
32:12
pretty unique features, but honestly, XD seems to have fallen behind its
32:17
competitors in terms of features. It's still updated regularly, of course,
32:24
but the features that are coming in seem a bit underwhelming compared to what
32:30
Figma and Sketch are are doing nowadays. Of course, I might be wrong about that.
32:36
It's just my personal opinion, but still my recommendation is Figma. Of course,
32:43
you're free to use any design software you want. Everything that you'll be learning in this course can be
32:50
successfully applied to other software other than Figma, of course. Um, but if
32:58
you're a beginner and you're looking to start working with something that just works great out of the box, then Figma.
33:07
So then, uh, my young Padawan, have we learned anything from this lesson? Well,
33:13
for UI design, uh, avoid Photoshop and Illustrator and focus on using a more
33:19
appropriate app. Sketch, Adobe XD, and Figma are great options to consider,
33:24
each having their own pros and cons. Uh, and my recommendation is Figma because it's free, crossplatform, and works in
33:32
the browser. All right, so hopefully at this point, uh, you've chosen your weapon, so to speak. So now it's time to
33:39
go to battle. But before we go to battle, we actually need to learn a bit
33:44
more theory. And the first theory that we'll start with is the color theory.
33:51
That's coming up next. [Music] When it comes to color theory, there is
Color theory
33:58
a lot of information out there. And if you did any kind of design work before, then you're probably familiar with the
34:05
basics of color theory. But if you're not, or maybe you just
34:11
need a refresh, well, this lesson is all about that. And I'll try and give you all the critical essential information
34:19
about working with color in web design without making it overly complicated. So
34:26
let's see how it goes. Let's start with the three main categories of color. We
34:32
have primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary colors are red, blue, and
34:38
yellow. They're called primary because you cannot mix any other colors to
34:43
obtain them. They're the building blocks from which all other colors are created. Secondary colors are obtained by equally
34:51
mixing primary colors. So if we mix red and blue, we get purple. If we mix red
34:58
and yellow, we get orange. And if we mix yellow and blue, we get green. Tertiary
35:04
or intermediate colors are obtained by combining primary and secondary colors.
35:10
These are blue green, blue violet, red orange, red violet, yellow orange, and
35:17
yellow green. It's also important to know the color terminology. So, let me
35:22
show you a few key terms you need to understand. And I'll explain these uh
35:28
concepts while working in Figma. So, I opened up the color picker. And the first term I want you to get familiar
35:35
with is hue. And hue represents the dominant color in a color family, right?
35:43
For example, pure red, pure blue, pure green, just pure yellow, etc., etc. So
35:52
the ones that you can see here in this section are the hues
35:58
and they represent like the purest colors in uh in the family and more than
36:04
often when we use the term color we actually we are referring to the hue. So
36:12
then after hue uh we have to talk about tints, shades and tones. A tint is
36:22
when you add white to a specific color. So, for example, if I were to duplicate
36:29
this color and I'm going to create a white background over it and set its
36:34
opacity to let's say 10%. Or let's say 40%, so you can uh more
36:41
clearly see. We just created a tint because we mixed white
36:47
with the color that we had before, right?
36:52
And of course, this works with any base color. If I change this to a blue,
36:57
you'll see that I have the original hue right here. And then by adding white,
37:04
I created a tint. That's all there is to it. Uh using a color picker,
37:11
we can add a tint by moving the color cursor to the left. See where
37:20
the white is right here? So, we actually stay on top
37:27
and we move to the left. And we're going to achieve exactly the same result. By
37:32
doing this, we're basically mixing uh that pure color that we see here
37:38
right in the top corner with white. So that's a tint. A shade is mixing that
37:45
color with black. So if I change this to black instead, we'll get a darker
37:52
version of that hue. And in the color picker, you can get that by moving the
37:58
color cursor down towards black, right? Essentially mixing that color with
38:07
black, just like this. So that's a shade. It's a darker version of the hue.
38:14
Now, a tone is when you mix a pure color with a gray. So, black and white. So, I
38:24
can basically take this and I can move my cursor
38:30
something like this. So, this is like an equal mix of white and black essentially
38:36
giving me a gray color. Right? And in the color picker, because I'm mixing
38:41
with both black and white to mix with gray, I can move this cursor like this
38:49
diagonally or I can move it like this or like this. Depends on um the kind of
38:56
gray I'm looking for. Right? So, as you can see, as I'm moving it
39:02
like to to this side, we're kind of getting the same uh the
39:07
same color as we did here. So, that's a tone. It's the mix of a pure color with
39:14
gray. Another term that you'll um hear a lot when talking about color is
39:20
saturation. And saturation basically refers to how rich or how dull a color
39:28
is. So for example, if I set this color right here, it's the purest version. So
39:35
it's saturation 100%. But if I start mixing in some gray,
39:43
you'll see that that color becomes desaturated,
39:49
right? It's muddier looking. It's not as sharp and as vibrant as the pure color.
39:57
So that's saturation. Another term you'll hear is brightness. And that just
40:03
basically tells you whether the color is closer to white on the scale or closer
40:10
to black on the scale. Right? So this is in terms of brightness.
40:15
This is less bright than for example this one because this one is closer to
40:20
white and this is closer to black. That's brightness. And finally uh let's
40:27
talk about color temperature. That basically tells us whether a color is
40:32
warm or cold. And cold colors are considered these right here. So blue uh
40:41
green purple. So around this area and warm colors are considered these yellow,
40:48
orange, red. That's what color temperature refers to. When working with
40:54
color, it's also important to understand the different color models that are
41:00
applicable like RGB, CMK, um HSB. And
41:05
I'm sure you've heard about these terms before, especially RGB. Uh, but maybe
41:11
you didn't you weren't curious what they mean or maybe you read about them and it
41:17
sounded too complicated. But it's not really it's actually very simple. CMYK
41:23
stands for cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. And to create colors,
41:29
this model uses what's called subtractive mixing. I won't go into details because this model is used for
41:36
printing. So, it's not that important for this course. This next one is
41:42
important and it's called RGB. We all know the term, right? Well, RGB stands
41:48
for red, green, and blue. And it uses additive mixing of light to create
41:54
different colors. When overlapping red, green, and blue at full brightness, we
42:00
get white. And this is how screens work. A very simple explanation would be this.
42:07
Every pixel on our screen is made up of three dots that emit red, green, and
42:14
blue light at various intensities. So the brighter those three dots are,
42:22
the brighter the color is going to be. When all three dots emit red, green, and
42:29
blue light at full intensity, the result is white light.
42:36
When those three dots don't emit any color, so zero brightness, the result is
42:42
black because that pixel is not lit up. So in RGB, you basically mix red, green,
42:49
and blue to get the color that you want. Let me show you a quick example. In
42:55
Figma, I open the color picker and I'm going to use the format switcher
43:02
to go from hex to RGB. And you can see that this pure red has the code of 255
43:12
0. The first value is for red. And as you can see, it's at max.
43:19
And by the way, if you didn't know this, 255 is the maximum value in this format.
43:25
Zero is the minimum. And then green is zero, blue is zero. To
43:33
get pure blue, we can set the red to zero, green to zero, and blue to 255.
43:42
And then we get pure blue. Same goes for green. If I make this 255 and the other
43:49
zero, so 02550 is pure green. But then to achieve a
43:57
certain color, I can start mixing these values. I can say
44:03
let's go with 100 for red, 150 for green, and maybe 240 for blue. And we
44:12
end up with this color. But usually you don't really do that
44:18
with RGB. You just, you know, use the color picker. You define your hue and
44:24
that's going to give you exactly the amount of red, green, and blue in that
44:29
color. And as I was saying previously, if we set 0 0, that's black because no
44:37
red, green, or blue is used. And if we go max on all of them,
44:45
we get pure white. So that's RGB.
44:50
The third and final color model we'll talk about is called SHB
44:56
and it stands for hue, saturation, and brightness. This uses a mix of these
45:01
three attributes to create different colors. This also works in digital design and I actually think that you get
45:09
way more control over the resulting color when you're using this model. Let
45:15
me show you what I mean. So when we're switching from RGB to HSB,
45:22
we get a similar um interface. This first value stands for hue, second
45:28
saturation, third brightness. So, here's how this works. Every hue on
45:37
the color wheel can be represented by a value from 0 to 360°.
45:43
So, for example, red is both 0 and 360°.
45:51
But then, as I move the slider to the left, you can see that
45:58
the hue number changes. For example, blue is around 200°
46:05
like so. And then the second value, saturation.
46:11
This basically tells us how pure that color is. So if I bring this all the way
46:17
up to 100%. It's going to be fully saturated. I can set it at 50%
46:25
and that's going to be the midway point between no saturation and full saturation.
46:31
And then brightness, how bright is this color? 100%. Okay, then it's totally
46:38
towards white. But if I set this to 50%, then it's halfway down towards black.
46:46
And I said that this is a great way of getting finer control over the resulting
46:54
color. And that's because let's say that I want, you know, a color that looks something
47:00
like this. And I want to find other colors. But I don't exactly like the way
47:06
this is going. So maybe I can tamper with the saturation a little bit. Maybe 70%.
47:14
Or maybe I want more saturation. Let's say 85%. Maybe I want a bit more brightness.
47:21
Let's say 90%. Right? So I can fine-tune a color by using these numbers. This
47:29
also comes in handy when I want to create a color palette. Right? So let's say I want to add another color to my
47:37
design. And let's say that I want to keep the same levels of saturation and
47:42
brightness, but only change the hue. Well, I can very easily do that. I can say, okay, let's try it with this hue.
47:50
Or maybe that's not working. Let's try it with something like this, 25°
47:57
for the hue, which gives us this orange color. All right. Or maybe I want to go
48:02
the other direction. Maybe I want to add a purple, something like this. So by
48:08
using HSB or hue, saturation, brightness, you can fine-tune
48:14
uh the resulting colors in your project. Now there is another color format that's
48:20
widely used and that's the hexadimal or in short hex. Uh this is made up of uh a
48:27
hash sign in front and then six letters or numbers. This is a friendlier way of
48:35
displaying RGB colors because the first two letters or numbers refer to red, the
48:42
next two refer to green, and the last two refer to blue. So, if we jump back
48:50
and we switch to hex, you can see that this is the uh the color format right
48:57
here. it's without the hash sign in front but um usually in in CSS you would
49:03
use a hash sign. So for now this is comprised of A7 for red 22 for green E5
49:14
for blue. Uh these are written in hexadimal format hence the name of the
49:20
uh of the color format. And as I said, it's a friendlier way of representing an
49:26
RGB color. So instead of, you know, using this format,
49:34
it's much easier to just copy this, paste it somewhere else, and it's just
49:39
as good. In fact, I think the hex format is the most popular when it comes to web
49:46
design. A lot of websites that work with color like gradient generators or color
49:51
scheme generators will usually provide um the colors in hex format and then you
49:58
can copy those you can paste them in your uh design software and you're good
50:04
to go. Now let's see some key takeaways. There are three primary colors red,
50:11
yellow and blue. These represent the building blocks for all the other colors. The secondary colors are
50:18
obtained by mixing the primary ones. Red plus yellow equals orange. Red plus blue
50:25
equals purple. Blue plus yellow equals green. Tertiary colors are obtained by
50:30
mixing primary and secondary colors. A hue is the dominant family of a given
50:37
color. Tints, shades, and tones are obtained by mixing a color with white,
50:43
black, and gray respectively. The CMK color model, cyan, magenta, yellow, and
50:49
black is used for printing. The RGB or red, green, and blue, and HSB, which
50:58
stands for hue, saturation, brightness models are used in digital media. The
51:04
hexadesimal or hex color format is a more friendlier way of representing RGB
51:11
colors. All right, so now that you hopefully understand more about um how
51:17
color is created and represented on our screens, let's dig a little deeper and
51:23
learn about how to pick the right colors for our projects. And it all starts with
51:31
color harmonies and psychology. That's up next.
Color harmonies, psychology and tools
51:39
Working with color can be daunting at times, especially for a beginner, because sure, you know the theory, but
51:45
how do you put it into practice? How do you pick colors that work best for your
51:51
project, but also work well together? Well, to answer that, let's begin by
51:57
learning about color psychology or the meaning of color. Uh, let me just start
52:02
by saying that what I'm about to show you is not an absolute truth. It's more of a set of guidelines because color can
52:10
have different meanings in different contexts, in different cultures. But
52:15
generally speaking, it goes something like this. Red is the color of passion
52:21
and it's great for grabbing attention or getting a message across. It represents
52:27
intensity, energy, excitement and it's very often used in sports related
52:32
websites or in websites that want to make a bold statement. Next up is blue,
52:39
the color of the skies and the seas. This is the most used color on the internet, fun fact. and it conveys
52:47
trust, calm, peace, intelligence, security. It's highly used by tech brands like
52:54
Twitter and Facebook, but also by a lot of financial institutions and political parties. Let's talk about yellow. Uh,
53:02
this is a very fun yet very bold color. It's the color of the sun, so it brings
53:07
joy and happiness. It can also convey warmth and energy and it's used a lot in
53:13
the entertainment industry and in children's toys. Next up, green, which
53:18
is the predominant color of nature. It represents health, well-being, balance,
53:24
fertility, safety, and it's usually associated with brands from the health
53:30
industry, with eco brands, with medical products, and of course, with anything
53:36
related to landscaping, gardening, and so on. Orange is the color of happiness,
53:43
joy, and confidence. Since it's made of red and yellow, it also borrows traits
53:49
from those two, like energy and optimism. Orange is said to be the color
53:54
of communication, but it also works really well in lots of different contexts because it's complimentary to
54:02
blue. And finally, we have purple, one of my favorite colors. It stands for
54:08
luxury, royalty, wealth, sophistication, and it's usually associated with luxury
54:15
brands and high-end products. All right. So, now that you have an understanding of how color can be perceived, let's
54:22
talk about color harmonies. Let's say that you picked a primary color for your
54:27
project. But how do you know which colors work well with that primary? How
54:34
do you create a color palette for your project? Well, this is where color
54:40
harmonies and a color wheel uh come in very handy. Let me show you. Let's say
54:46
that you picked this blue color as your primary. And what you need to do is copy
54:52
its color code and you need to go to color.adobe.com. This is a great tool that I recommend
54:59
for every web designer. And what you do is you find the color that is indicated
55:04
by this carrot, which is the base color. And then you paste in
55:11
your blue. And just like that, Adobe is going to give you updates. Uh, sorry about that.
55:18
I meant suggestions, not updates. Uh, suggestions for possible colors. And
55:26
these suggestions are based on color harmonies. And we have a couple of them
55:32
here. And if you switch between them, you'll see the suggestions of colors
55:38
change, but also you'll see how those colors are being built. So let's start
55:44
with analogous. This harmony will basically pick neighboring colors
55:51
for your bass. And as you can see, if I'm going to move my base color around,
55:59
the neighbors will move as well, right? And of course, the resulting color
56:06
scheme will be changed as well. Uh monochromatic will basically give you
56:13
tints and shades for your base color. Triad looks something like this,
56:22
right? So you get kind of a threepoint star with the base color being on one
56:30
end of the star and it just creates a color scheme like so. Uh complimentary
56:36
is the most contrasting color scheme because it uses colors from the opposite
56:43
end of the spectrum. So for example, if I were to use that blue
56:48
that uh I got from sketch uh as a complement, it gives me a nice orange
56:56
color that sits on the opposite end of the spectrum. And of course, as I switch around, you can see uh the colors that
57:05
are being generated. Uh split complimentary is pretty similar. Instead of one color on the
57:12
opposite end of the spectrum, it kind of picks two. So it gives you uh more variation in
57:20
your color palette. Double split complimentary is very similar but on top
57:25
of the opposite colors it also picks two neighboring colors.
57:30
And then we have square which looks like this compound. And then uh you can also use Adobe color
57:38
to get shades of a base color which is really cool. Now out of all these I
57:45
believe that analogous uh monochromatic and complimentary are the most used but
57:52
obviously don't let that stop you. If you cycle through these and you find a color combination that you like and you
57:59
think would work well, then by all means go ahead and use that in your project.
58:06
But usually you'll probably stick with these three, analogous, monochromatic or
58:12
complimentary. Now, since I showed you Adobe Color, which by the way is an awesome tool and I recommend it to
58:19
everyone, um I'm also going to show you a few more so that um whenever you need
58:25
them, you know exactly where to go. So, here are a few more useful tools for
58:32
working with color. The first one is called Color Space. It's currently in
58:38
beta. You can find it at myolor.space. Uh but basically what you do is you
58:44
paste in your color code or you can use the picker um to um to pick your color right here
58:51
and there and you click generate. And that's going to generate a bunch of
58:57
color uh palettes for you with your base color as the origin as the first one
59:04
here. So you can just cycle through them and when you find one that you like, you
59:09
can simply copy that and use it in your project. So that is uh color space. Next
59:16
is color hunt. You can search for pallets based on uh
59:22
the color that you want. You can also uh use some of these filters here like
59:29
retro and that's going to give you like a pre-selection of different color palettes which is really nice. You can
59:37
you know click on a specific color and that's going to copy it to your clipboard. Really cool. Next we have
59:45
Musli color colors by Invision. Actually this is a very cool app. So you can
59:52
paste in a color code or name or you can pick one of the colors. And what's
59:58
really cool about it is it gives you a live UI kit demo. So you can see how the
1:00:03
color palette uh that you pick will work on that UI kit. Right? So you
1:00:12
just hover and you can see the colors being used in
1:00:18
real time and then you can um you know
1:00:23
of course randomize this. You can click on a specific uh pallet and you know
1:00:29
copy the colors from there. But yeah this functionality
1:00:35
that just uh shows you how it looks like in a real environment is pretty cool. So
1:00:41
that's Musli Colors by Envision. Uh then we have uh web gradients. Uh this is a
1:00:50
website that I use frequently whenever I want to get some really cool gradients.
1:00:56
There's a bunch of them pre-made. And you can copy each color individually or
1:01:03
you can copy the CSS and just use it in your project. Another
1:01:08
uh source for getting color inspiration is dribble. So for example, I can open a
1:01:14
dribble shot. And if I scroll down, I can find the color palette that's being
1:01:19
used here. And I can download this as an acco file. I believe this is for
1:01:24
Photoshop. And I can also click on an individual color.
1:01:30
And that's going to search like all the shots that contain that color or
1:01:36
probably something similar to that color. Pretty cool. And finally,
1:01:43
uh, one last suggestion here. If you're using Mac OS, uh, there is an app called
1:01:49
Color Snapper, and it's a really cool app. You set a shortcut. Mine is
1:01:54
commandoption C. And it brings up a systemwide color picker, which I can then use to pick any color I want from
1:02:03
my screen. And that gives me by default a CSS hex like so. But
1:02:11
I can choose the format from this list. I can grab RGB, RGBA, HSL, and so on and
1:02:20
so forth. So, that's Color Snapper. It's a paid app and it only works on Mac OS,
1:02:27
but it's really, really cool. Very helpful. All right, so with that out of the way,
1:02:34
let's take a look at some key takeaways. Colors can have different meanings in
1:02:39
different scenarios or different cultures. Color harmonies allow you to easily create a color palette. A
1:02:47
complimentary color palette will give you the most contrast, while a monochromatic one will give you the
1:02:53
least contrast. Use Adobe Color to explore color themes or create your own.
1:03:01
Okay, so now that you know how to work with color and how to create a color scheme, let's take that knowledge and
1:03:08
apply it to our project coming up. [Music]
Creating a color palette for our project
1:03:14
All right. So now we're in the realm of UI design. We have a project brief, a
1:03:20
wireframe, and a pretty clear direction of where we need to go. Now our job is
1:03:25
to create a design based on that wireframe. And the easiest place to
1:03:32
start with is a color scheme. So let's go ahead and create that. I'm in Figma
1:03:39
and I renamed the initial page to assets and this is where I'm going to keep
1:03:45
everything that's color related, typography related and so on. So to get
1:03:52
started, let's um settle on the primary color. For that, I'm going to jump back
1:04:00
to my project brief and I'm going to pick a color from this logo. And I can
1:04:07
either go with, you know, the orange, maybe the more yellowish, or I can go
1:04:12
with this pinkish purple kind of color. So, let's go ahead and sample
1:04:20
one of these two. I think I'll go for this one. Right. So,
1:04:26
here I'm just going to create like an oval. Just make it 160 by 160. And I'm
1:04:32
going to paste in that color. So, this is a starting point and I'm going to open up the color picker. And I think I
1:04:40
want I want this to be a bit more towards red. So, I'm going to move the
1:04:46
hue to the red. And maybe I want a little bit more brightness to it. So,
1:04:51
I'm going to move it, you know, to the top. Something like that. And after
1:04:57
playing around with it a little bit, I ended up with this version. So, FC3A79.
1:05:03
This is uh currently our primary color. So uh in
1:05:10
Figma, we can actually create a color style. We can click these four dots
1:05:16
here, click plus, and we're going to call this primary. So now every time I have another element
1:05:25
that I want to apply that color to, I can simply click here,
1:05:31
select it, and it's going to be the same. If I'm going to change that color
1:05:36
and let me actually switch uh this view mode, I can click on edit style,
1:05:43
right? And I can update it to whatever other value I want. And
1:05:50
that's going to update all the other elements that use that color. It's a pretty sweet uh functionality, but for
1:05:56
now, we're going to stick with this one, FC3A 79.
1:06:02
So, that's the primary. Based on the primary, we can now start building our color palette. And for that, I'm going
1:06:08
to use Adobe color. So, I'm going to jump in here, paste that in. And
1:06:17
I'm actually going to use an analog harmony rule because I feel that using
1:06:24
uh colors that are closer to our primary on the color wheel is going to be a good
1:06:31
thing. First of all, because the logos colors are pretty much like that.
1:06:38
They're all using kind of an analogous um color harmony. But also if you
1:06:44
remember the color theory or the meaning of color right uh these that we see here
1:06:52
are you know oriented towards uh red orange so they represent energy and um
1:06:59
you can use them to draw attention and this works really well with the kind of
1:07:05
website that uh that our client Robert Fox is trying to create. So, I'm going
1:07:12
to use this color scheme and I will grab this kind of reddish orange
1:07:18
as my secondary. So, let's copy that. Let's duplicate
1:07:24
this one and let's unlink. Paste in the new color and then we'll
1:07:31
create another color style called secondary. Awesome. Now I'll also be creating a
1:07:40
gradient uh between these two colors. So under
1:07:45
fill I'm going to choose uh linear.
1:07:54
So we go from this color to this color.
1:07:59
So we go from the secondary to the primary. And let's make sure this is 100%. And also uh let's make the
1:08:06
gradient from left to right like so. And let's uh
1:08:14
rename this. Or actually let's create a style which will be called brand gradient. Awesome.
1:08:23
So now we have the primary, secondary, and then a gradient. At this point, you
1:08:29
can go further than that and create, you know, tertiary colors, you know, picking
1:08:34
these or variations of that color. But for me, for this type of website, I
1:08:40
think just primary and secondary colors are more than enough. Now, let's turn
1:08:46
our attention to the grays because this is super important. Grays will basically
1:08:51
be used for text and other elements, but mainly for text. So, it's really
1:08:57
important that we get it right. Uh, one thing I would advise uh against doing is
1:09:04
to use pure black. So, if you go this and this and you plan on using that for
1:09:10
text, that's a big no no. Uh, pure black is just it contrasts too much and it
1:09:18
just doesn't look good. Instead, what you can do is use a darker gray. You
1:09:24
know, something like this. just tone it down a little bit so that it's not too
1:09:30
harsh on the eyes. Now, what I also like to do is mix a
1:09:36
gray with my primary color and have that as my resulting black color or gray
1:09:43
color. So, essentially, I'm creating a tone of my primary color. A couple of
1:09:50
ways to do that. First of all, I can,
1:09:56
you know, go to go to the color here and just mix this directly like so,
1:10:06
you know, with black and with white. So, mix it with gray basically until I get
1:10:13
to the desired result. Or uh something else you can do is you
1:10:20
can uh duplicate this on top of itself, fill it with pure black and then reduce
1:10:25
the opacity to you know 80% or 90%. It
1:10:31
really depends on how much of uh how much black you want to mix into this.
1:10:37
Personally, after um a little testing, I got to the following color, 261F
1:10:45
22. So, I'm basically mixing my
1:10:51
primary hue with a bit of gray. And on a color picker, I'm around here somewhere.
1:10:58
Okay. So, I'm going to again create a color style. I'm going to call this
1:11:04
black. And then I'm going to duplicate this to create some variations. And the
1:11:10
first variation is going to be 75%. And I'm going to call this
1:11:17
black 75. The next one
1:11:23
is going to be at 50% and I'm going to call this
1:11:28
black 50. And we'll do the same 25%
1:11:33
black 25%
1:11:39
black 10 and then finally 5%
1:11:45
black five. So what this allows you to do is first of all have a great
1:11:51
selection of color styles you can always edit and apply to multiple elements. Uh,
1:11:58
but also it saves you the trouble of searching for
1:12:06
tints of the same color later on during the design process. So, for example, if
1:12:11
you want uh a piece of text to be more muted, well, you can just simply choose uh
1:12:18
black 50 or black 25. If you want to create like a line separator, you can
1:12:25
use the black five or black 10 color. All right. So, they're right here. Easy
1:12:32
to access. And if at some point you decide to change the underlying color,
1:12:38
it's really easy to do as well. You just edit, for example, black 50. If you want
1:12:44
to choose a different one, just, you know, change it hue from here.
1:12:50
it's going to keep its transparency and because it's a color style um that
1:12:55
change is going to be reflected on all the elements that are using it. And
1:13:01
finally, I want to create a let's call it a contextual color for errors because
1:13:08
uh you know we have forms and maybe in those forms at some point we'll have to display an error message
1:13:15
and to properly color the error message we usually use um some kind of red
1:13:21
color. So if we go back to the color palette uh we can see we have a kind of a red here which is pretty nice. So,
1:13:28
we're going to copy that, paste it in here, and we're going to
1:13:34
call this error. Pretty simple. So, that is our color
1:13:41
palette. We have the primary, secondary, we have a gradient if we decide to use
1:13:47
it. Then we have uh the the grays as that column starting with the base color
1:13:56
and then a couple of tints. And by the way, uh maybe you're a bit
1:14:02
confused about the whole transparency thing. Uh this is another way to create tints. So instead of mixing the color
1:14:09
directly with white, right? If I have a
1:14:15
a white background behind
1:14:22
those elements and I lower the transparency of one of the colors, I
1:14:28
basically get a a tint of that color because I'm mixing the original with the background
1:14:34
because of the transparency. Does that make sense? If not, leave a comment uh
1:14:39
down below and I'll try to uh to explain this again. But, you know, when creating
1:14:45
tints for this type of color, you can also do it the oldfashioned way. You can
1:14:50
open up a color picker. Let's say we have this color and we want to mix in some more
1:14:58
white. Well, you can simply uh you know drag uh the cursor up
1:15:06
until you get to the uh to the desired hex value. In our case, that value would
1:15:13
be something like this. So, a little bit higher up than um than what I showed you. But I find this approach with the
1:15:21
uh opacity much easier to manage because if you want to change the underlying
1:15:27
color, you don't have to redo those tints
1:15:33
because of the transparency. They're done automatically for you. Okay. So, we
1:15:39
have the uh primary, secondary, gradient, the grays, and then a
1:15:45
contextual color for the error messages. Now, before we end this lesson, quick
1:15:53
word about color contrast. You see, when whenever you're using text
1:16:01
in a web design, you have to ensure that it has proper contrast compared to its
1:16:06
background, right? so that people can read it properly, especially people with
1:16:12
visual impairments. And there are online tools that can do that for you. You can
1:16:19
simply search for online contrast checker. Uh, personally, I use an app
1:16:25
that's called contrast. Let me see if I have it open here. There it is. So with this app, I can
1:16:33
basically sample any color from my screen and then I can sample the
1:16:40
background color and that's going to give me a test result. Double A+ with a a contrast
1:16:47
ratio of 3.94. That's a pass, right? So any text that's
1:16:55
this color on a white background passes my contrast check. This is what you're
1:17:01
always aiming for. Let's see about the secondary color. Okay, this passes as
1:17:07
well. My primary black passes with an
1:17:12
even higher ratio. My 75 passes,
1:17:19
my 50 passes. But then once I get here,
1:17:24
I get a fail because I have a too low of a ratio, which means any text that is
1:17:31
this color on top of a white background will be hard to read because it doesn't
1:17:36
have enough contrast. Okay? So, this is something you should always check uh to
1:17:41
make sure that the colors that you're using for your text have enough contrast
1:17:47
to meet the accessibility guidelines. And there are plenty of apps. Uh if
1:17:54
you're using Mac OS, then I highly recommend this app. It's called Contrast.
1:18:00
Uh let me see if I have an about. There we go.
1:18:07
Uh this is a paid app by the way, but there are a couple more. Uh there are uh
1:18:12
a few color pickers like SIP that have an integrated color uh contrast checker.
1:18:19
There are online tools and those are probably the uh the easiest to use for
1:18:24
everyone. But just remember to check for color contrast uh before uh signing off
1:18:30
on uh on a color palette like this. All right. Now for some key takeaways. When
1:18:37
starting the design process, it's always easier to begin with the colors. Create
1:18:42
the palette for primary and secondary colors first, then move on to grays.
1:18:48
When creating the grays, mix in a bit of the primary color. Make sure that every
1:18:54
color you're using for text or interactive elements has enough contrast. All right. Now, it's your turn
1:19:01
to create the color palette for your version of the project. And I encourage
1:19:07
you to be a little bit more adventurous here. While it's totally fine to follow
1:19:13
exactly what I do, uh you could also pick a different primary color, for
1:19:19
example, and a different harmony for that. If you want, you can choose a
1:19:25
different logo for your version of the project and base your color scheme off
1:19:30
of that. Again, it's totally fine to to copy exactly what I do, but you know, feel
1:19:37
free to to change it up every now and then and make it your own. Uh with that
1:19:43
said, uh now that we have the color part taken care of, let's move on to
1:19:51
another fundamental aspect of uh web design and that is typography. I'll see
1:19:58
you very soon.
Let’s talk about typography
1:20:03
Arguably, typography is the most important part of any design because the
1:20:09
majority of content is usually text. So, if you're not using the right type face,
1:20:16
um, font size, line height, font weight, and so on, everything else just kind of
1:20:23
falls apart. And it doesn't really matter how good-looking your website is or the rest
1:20:30
of the website is, if your typography is subpar, uh, that's going to translate to the
1:20:37
other things. So, how do you get started with typography? How do you uh pick the
1:20:44
right type faces and the right attributes for the fonts that you're going to be using? Well, it's a
1:20:50
multi-step process and I'm going to try and simplify it for you, but it all starts with uh choosing where you get
1:20:59
your fonts from. Most often you will get your fonts from foundaries or font
1:21:05
libraries, but there are also individuals that uh or teams that sell
1:21:11
uh fonts on marketplaces like graphic river. Inado elements also has a huge
1:21:17
collection of fonts and you can easily refine your search by various font
1:21:22
categories, spacing, size and so on. But marketplaces aside, uh it's very easy to
1:21:30
get a hold of fonts nowadays, quality fonts, I mean, and since you're
1:21:36
a beginner, I recommend you get your fonts from either Google Fonts or Adobe
1:21:42
Fonts. First of all, let's have a look at Google Fonts. It's a service provided by
1:21:48
Google and it's totally free. Uh you can find a bunch of fonts here. Once you
1:21:55
access it, uh you can um browse this entire list. Uh you can type your own
1:22:02
sentence. Hello. And you're going to see a preview of
1:22:07
that sentence using every single font. Uh you can also search for specific
1:22:13
fonts like so. And you can also browse the
1:22:19
various categories of fonts. serif son serif display handwriting monospace and
1:22:26
so on. So if I'm looking for example uh for a monospace font I can just select
1:22:31
that and I'm going to see all the options here. Now Adobe Fonts also has a
1:22:38
ton of fonts you can choose from but this is paid. So you need um an Adobe uh
1:22:45
Creative Cloud subscription to access this. And I believe you can also access
1:22:51
it separately, although don't quote me on that. I'm not exactly sure. But uh personally, I do use an Adobe Creative
1:22:58
Cloud subscription, so I do have access to Adobe Fonts. And I think this has um
1:23:07
higher quality fonts than Google, but that's to be expected. This is a paid
1:23:12
service. This is a free service. And even though you can find really high
1:23:18
quality fonts here, uh you can find more of them right here on Adobe.
1:23:24
And this is like exactly the same. You can go to all fonts and you do have some
1:23:30
extra options here. You can um filter by the various languages,
1:23:37
but also by some predefined tags. For example, I don't know, let's go with
1:23:44
cursive. And these are lists curated by the team at Adobe Fonts. And then you
1:23:51
also have some additional properties here. Classification allows you to choose just like Google fonts from sans
1:23:58
serif slab serif script and so on. Uh but also you can filter fonts by weight,
1:24:06
width, x, contrast and a couple of other things here.
1:24:12
So you have a much more granular uh control over the filters in Adobe than
1:24:18
you have with Google. Uh you can also type in
1:24:24
your own sample text or you can, you know, choose from a pre-existing one. Uh
1:24:30
you can modify the text size. And what I really like about Adobe Font
1:24:36
is that once you're signed in and you're also signed into the desktop app, the
1:24:41
Creative Cloud desktop app, uh once you find a font that you like,
1:24:47
uh you can activate it and that's going to automatically download it to your computer so it's ready to use right then
1:24:54
and there. So, that's a quick look at Adobe Fonts and Google Font. the two
1:25:00
places I recommend you get your fonts from as a beginner. Okay, so let's say you picked the place where you want to
1:25:08
get your fonts from. What's next? Well, it's time to pick the actual fonts. And
1:25:14
for that, uh you need to understand the brand that you're designing for and also its end
1:25:21
users, right? So the people that are going to be using that that website
1:25:26
basically. uh that part should mostly be done in the UX stage where all the user
1:25:31
research is happening and all that. So now you need to decide on what style of
1:25:38
font uh you want to use and what would help uh the brand get the message
1:25:45
across. For example, if you need to design for a luxury brand and the
1:25:50
feeling you're trying to evoke is that of luxury and sophistication,
1:25:55
then you might go for a serif font as the big headliner like uh Saroski is
1:26:01
doing here. However, you wouldn't use that serif in a tech website like
1:26:07
Stripe. Here you would use sun serifs to evoke a feeling of modern and trust. One
1:26:15
very important factor in font choice is readability. So, uh after you've chosen
1:26:21
a couple of fonts that you think would work well with your project, uh think about how those fonts would look like in
1:26:28
different sizes, especially smaller sizes. Because if you're displaying all
1:26:34
this text content of your website on a mobile device and the text is like
1:26:40
really small and people can't read it, then what do you do? Loading time is
1:26:47
something that we often forget about. And the thing is the more fonts or font
1:26:53
weights we use in our design, the slower the loading time of that website is
1:26:59
going to be and uh the bigger the impact on the performance. And yes, I know that
1:27:06
website performance is um is on the web development side of things. So
1:27:13
technically not our job, but if you're sending a developer um a design that um requires them to
1:27:21
load six or seven different fonts or font weights and the website performance
1:27:28
has to suffer because of that. Well, that's on you because you should have thought about that. See how
1:27:35
uh there's an overlap between two different specializations
1:27:44
um web development and web design. You got to be mindful about these things and
1:27:49
always um have the bigger picture in your mind. Right? So yes, technically
1:27:56
you're the designer, but uh you must also design the website in such a way
1:28:01
that's not going to pose problems to the developers, right? And finally,
1:28:08
we're talking about font attributes. So let's say that you picked your font or fonts uh for your project. Next, you
1:28:16
need to decide on the uh font roles and their attributes and role meaning what
1:28:24
font will be used for what element for the headings. What will you choose?
1:28:30
Uh for paragraphs, what will it be? And attribute meaning size, weight, line
1:28:37
height, and so on. In regards to roles, it's very simple when you're using a
1:28:43
single font family for the entire website, right? Because all the elements will be using fonts from that family.
1:28:50
But when you're using two different font families, or as they're also called, type faces, then it gets a bit trickier.
1:28:59
Personally, I like to use the fonts with the greatest readability for smaller
1:29:04
elements in my UI like uh you know body text uh buttons, menus, captions and
1:29:13
that sort of things and uh use the other type face on larger elements like
1:29:19
headings. So that takes care of roles. Now we need
1:29:24
to talk about attributes. So, how do you pick the right font size,
1:29:31
the font weight, letter spacing, and all that? Well, when it comes to font sizes,
1:29:36
because that's probably the biggest deal. Uh, thankfully, we have something called type scales. I made a separate
1:29:44
course on Tutts Plus on this topic. So, if you want to learn more about type scales, go ahead and check that out.
1:29:52
Naturally, I will be using type scales in this course and I'll show you how to create them because uh they make our job
1:30:00
infinitely easier. But I won't go into as much detail as I did in the dedicated
1:30:08
course for type scales, right? Because it's pointless to repeat uh the same
1:30:13
information. Now, uh let's see about some key takeaways for this lesson. To properly
1:30:22
define the typography of your project, there are a few steps you need to follow. First, decide where you want to
1:30:30
get your fonts from. I recommend Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts. Then, decide which
1:30:36
fonts would work best for the brand and audience based on the message you want
1:30:42
your website to convey. Fonts should also be picked using criteria like readability and loading time. After you
1:30:50
picked your fonts, you need to set the proper roles and attributes like size,
1:30:56
line height, weight, etc. All right, so now that you got this introduction to
1:31:01
typography, uh let's focus on our project and see what fonts we'll be
1:31:06
using and how we'll be using those coming up.
Creating the typography for our project
1:31:11
[Music] All right. So, let's um follow the steps
1:31:16
that I described previously and uh pick the right typography characteristics for
1:31:22
our project. Let's begin. First step, let's pick where we'll get our fonts
1:31:28
from. Personally, I am a big fan of Adobe Fonts. I have access to the service and this is what I'll use. Next
1:31:36
step is to pick the fonts that would work well with the brand and the
1:31:42
audience and the message that we're trying to convey. So, if we look back at
1:31:47
the project brief all the way down here under designing guidelines, uh it says
1:31:53
that Robert wants a modern looking website and he likes to keep things
1:31:59
clean and simple. So in terms of fonts, when I hear the word modern, I
1:32:06
immediately think son serif, right? And if you don't know what um the
1:32:11
differences between serif and sun serif, well let me show you. This one right
1:32:17
here is a serif. See these embellishments on the letters? Well, these are called
1:32:24
seraps. But a son serif or without serif is just
1:32:30
a cleaner looking type face, right? You can't see any of the seraps here because
1:32:38
well there are none. And usually seraps
1:32:43
are considered to be more classic more old school type faces while son seraps
1:32:49
are considered to be modern. So we settled on sans seraps. Now which ones?
1:32:57
Because there are so many right if we click on this uh category we have uh
1:33:03
almost 800 font families of son sun serifs in Google fonts. Well, Robert is
1:33:10
what? A UI designer, right? So, let's think about what keywords come into mind
1:33:17
when we think UI designer. One of them could be geometry, right? So, maybe geometric. Well, there is such a thing
1:33:24
as a geometric type face. It's one of the classifications.
1:33:29
And there are a couple of geometric type faces out there. One of which is Brandon
1:33:36
Grotesque. and Brandon grotesque looks something like this.
1:33:48
You can see all the different fonts here. This looks really good. Adobe Fonts also shows you some uh some use
1:33:56
cases here on the top. And I think for this type of website, for a designer's
1:34:03
portfolio, basically this um font family would work awesome. So this is one of
1:34:11
the fonts that we'll be using. Brandon Grotesque from Adobe Fonts. Now I'll be
1:34:16
using two type faces in this design
1:34:22
and I'll be using Brandon for the larger elements like headings. So that means we
1:34:28
need another type face that I'll be using for the smaller elements like the
1:34:34
body text captions button menu items and so on. And you know you can Google this
1:34:41
stuff you'll find font pairings font combinations from different foundaries
1:34:46
but uh from my experience I know that Brandon Grotesque uh pairs very well
1:34:52
with Proximanova. This is another um sans serif type face
1:34:58
which looks something like this. It's relatively similar to Brandon grotesque
1:35:04
but also has a distinct characteristic. And um Proximanova also works well on
1:35:13
smaller font sizes. Like if I were to reduce this to like 18 or even 16 pixels
1:35:21
and I try to read the text here, it's very readable, right? And it looks very
1:35:27
good even in bold itallic. It works very well. In contrast, if I
1:35:34
were to use uh Brand and Grotesque in smaller font sizes, right, it's uh it's
1:35:40
readable, but it's not as readable in my opinion as Prox Manova. So, these are
1:35:46
the two uh type faces that we're going to use, Brandon Grotesque and Proximova.
1:35:54
So once um we install these on our system, we can jump back to our design
1:36:01
software and we need to determine the roles and the attributes. So for that
1:36:08
I'm going to create a frame and I'm going to call it typography. And inside
1:36:15
I'm just going to start listing a couple of elements that I want to showcase.
1:36:22
elements like a paragraph. Just some uh some dummy text for now. Let's just
1:36:28
resize this. And for font size, I'm going to use 21, which is our base font
1:36:34
size. And the line height is going to be 30. All right. So, that's going to give
1:36:39
me an exact representation of what my paragraphs will look like. And I can
1:36:44
even go one step further and choose the exact color that we're going to be
1:36:50
using. Let's say black 75, something like that. Next up, uh we're
1:36:56
going to make a list of all the headings that we plan on using. So, we start with
1:37:04
heading one, or you can start with heading six, um the other way around. It's really up
1:37:11
to you. Let's start with heading one, heading two, and let's duplicate this. 3
1:37:17
4 5 6. All right. Let's set their uh font family to brand and grotesque.
1:37:25
Let's make all of these bold. Now, let's set their font sizes. For that, we're
1:37:33
going to use a nice tool called typecale. So, we'll go to typescale.com.
1:37:39
And this is a tool that creates typographic scales, the thing I
1:37:45
mentioned earlier in the course. So with a typographic scale, it's very simple.
1:37:50
You start with a base font size and a scale or a ratio. And the algorithm
1:37:56
basically creates font sizes based on these two elements by multiplying the
1:38:03
base font size with the scale and then just keep repeating that process until
1:38:11
you get this. Right? So for example, uh 16 pixels multiplied by 1.25
1:38:20
will equal 20 pixels. 20 pixels multiplied by 1.250
1:38:26
is going to be equal to 25 and so on. You take this, you multiply it with the scale, you get to the next value and the
1:38:34
next and the next and the next and so on. So for our project, we're going to
1:38:40
use a base font size of 21 pixels. So, a bit larger than usual, but because uh
1:38:48
Robert wanted uh an airy website with lots of white space, uh I
1:38:55
think a larger than usual typography will serve as well. And when it comes to
1:39:01
the scale, it goes something like this. The smaller the
1:39:07
ratio, the smaller the contrast between lower font sizes and bigger font sizes.
1:39:15
And you'll see that as I'm increasing the scale,
1:39:20
the contrast between small and big gets more and more
1:39:26
obvious. And if I go like to a golden ratio, you
1:39:31
can see that it's uh a crazy amount of contrast between this and this. Uh for
1:39:39
this type of project, I will choose an augmented fourth scale or 1.414.
1:39:48
And this gives me uh a nice balance between smaller font sizes and bigger
1:39:55
font sizes. So once I do that, all I have to do is reference this tool and
1:40:03
apply the font the font sizes to my elements here. So the first one heading
1:40:12
one is 118.70 and we're going to round that up to 119.
1:40:21
So 119 and also the line height. This is very
1:40:29
important. In Figma, you actually get a bit of help if you delete the original value and leave it on auto. Figma will
1:40:37
kind of calculate that for you based on a certain multiplier. But to truly see
1:40:44
if you're happy with the line height, you can just enter some additional lines
1:40:49
of text and then work on this uh experiment with different values until
1:40:55
you find that this text looks as it should. In my case, 144 is um the
1:41:04
correct line height that I'm looking for. There's not too much space between the lines, but not too little either.
1:41:12
For example, if I were to set this at 90, the the text would kind of be crammed in
1:41:18
this very small space, and I don't want that. So, 144 it is for the heading one.
1:41:26
And following uh this exact uh same procedure, I do uh the rest of the
1:41:33
headings. So for heading two, I will use 84 pixels of line height of font size,
1:41:41
excuse me. And for the line height, I'm going to set it to 112. And I'll keep doing that for the rest of
1:41:49
the headings. So after doing that, the type scale looks something like this. We
1:41:55
have the heading one, 2, 3, 4, 5, and six. Now let's see about font weights.
1:42:03
because these are headings. Uh most of them will be bold, but every
1:42:09
now and then I think um kind of a a change in this rhythm can be beneficial.
1:42:16
So what I like to usually do is have the heading three use a different font
1:42:22
weight. Usually something that's uh a lot different than the others like
1:42:28
light. So heading one and two will be bold, four, five and six will be bold,
1:42:35
but heading three will be light. And I think this will create uh some nice
1:42:40
visual interest in the page. It will contrast really well with the other
1:42:46
headings. And overall, I think it's going to be a welcome change. And
1:42:51
finally, what I like to do is name these uh frames to also reflect the base
1:42:59
font size and also the ratio.
1:43:04
Just so I know um in the future if I want to change something or I want to
1:43:11
add another element in the mix, I know exactly what the base font size was and
1:43:17
the ratio. And then of course if we want we can select all of these we can give
1:43:22
them the color of black and we can even create text styles for them. So we can
1:43:29
select our paragraph. Go to text. Click on these buttons. Click on plus
1:43:35
paragraph. This
1:43:41
H1,
1:43:46
H2, H3, and so on. We'll do the same for the
1:43:54
other three. And that's it. That's how you get your typography started
1:44:00
with Figma and this great tool called Typescale. Uh there is another tool I
1:44:06
wanted to show you that's called archetype. And with this tool you can uh pick your fonts here. You can define the
1:44:14
various sizes for the base paragraph for the scale ratio and you can see a nice
1:44:21
uh a nice preview here. Personally, I prefer working with typescale. I find it
1:44:27
much uh faster to use. It's much more fluid. Uh but as an alternative, um
1:44:33
archetype is also there if you need it. Okay. So, with the typography taken care
1:44:40
of, let's see about some key takeaways. Start your typography process by
1:44:46
defining the type scale, font weights, and line heights. Use tools like type
1:44:52
scale and archetype to make this task easier. If your design app allows it,
1:44:57
create text styles for elements like headings and paragraphs. Okay. Uh now
1:45:03
it's your turn. So go ahead and create the typography for your version of uh of
1:45:10
the website. And of course you can copy everything I do, but I encourage you to
1:45:15
try other things. Try other type faces, other type scales. Play around with the
1:45:22
font sizes, the font weights, see what what looks best uh to your eye. Uh now
1:45:28
the main aspects of our project's typography are in place. So along with
1:45:35
the colors that we defined previously, we now have a solid foundation to build
1:45:40
on. But speaking of foundation, u there are still some fundamental
1:45:48
aspects about web design that we haven't talked about or that we haven't covered.
1:45:54
And uh one of them is spacing and sizing. So let's go ahead and do that
1:46:00
next. All right, spacing and sizing in web
Spacing and sizing in web design
1:46:07
design. This refers to how much space you should use inside and outside of
1:46:13
elements and also how big or small they should be. And sometimes these will
1:46:18
overlap because the size of an element can sometimes be dictated by the
1:46:25
interior spacing. Like for example in a button, right? The bigger the padding
1:46:31
inside a button or the bigger the font size, the bigger the button will be. Now, for both spacing and sizing, I'm
1:46:38
using something that's called the eight point system. And in this system, every
1:46:45
dimension is basically a multiple of eight. So, for example, this button has
1:46:51
a padding of 16 pixels on top and bottom and 32 pixels left and right. Both of
1:46:58
these values are multiples of eight. And I use the system everywhere from margins
1:47:03
and paddings to distance between elements to uh widths or heights for
1:47:09
images or other fixed dimension elements. Um I've been doing it for a
1:47:14
while now. It's worked out great for me and I think the main two reasons I use
1:47:20
it for are uh simplicity and consistency. simplicity because it's
1:47:26
very easy to remember the multiples of eight and uh consistency because no
1:47:31
matter what project I'm working on, I know all the measurements are made using the eight point system. So even if I
1:47:39
come back to a project after a while, it's easier to make changes because I don't have to check all the time what
1:47:45
the existing measurements are. Not to mention it's also easier for developers because once you tell them that hey I'm
1:47:52
working with the eightoint system. Uh it becomes much easier for them to u deduce
1:47:58
certain measurements without having having to measure every single time.
1:48:03
There are also more technical reasons for using this system and you can read more about that in this article on
1:48:11
medium. You can find the link in the video description. But for now, uh please uh take my recommendation and use
1:48:17
this system at least for this project and you know give it a go. Uh I'm sure
1:48:23
you'll be very happy with it. Now you might be wondering about grids. Uh those
1:48:29
are used for sizing and aligning content, right? Well, yes they are. But
1:48:34
I'm not going to use grids for this project. And let me tell you why. So the
1:48:39
use of grids in web design is pretty straightforward. Basically a grid
1:48:45
consists of a set of columns that are of equal width and between those columns
1:48:51
there is a fixed amount of space and in Figma you can um easily create one using
1:48:57
the layout grid functionality. So you just add one here you select columns and
1:49:05
you input the number of columns. Typically, you would use a 12 column grid for various reasons. And you can
1:49:13
play around with the with the margin. Let's say 32 pixels. That's going to add like a small margin here. And the gutter
1:49:21
is the distance between each column, right? So, this is a typical grid. And
1:49:26
then once you start placing the content on your page, you would basically align
1:49:33
it to the grid. Right? Let's say you have another
1:49:39
element. You can align it like so. Maybe another one, you know, you can align it
1:49:45
like this. Maybe you have a piece of text and you're going to align it like this.
1:49:51
So, that's, you know, the whole point. It it creates a nice set of uh
1:49:57
guidelines for you to align and size your content. And it's also um
1:50:03
beneficial later on when you're uh developing the project, right?
1:50:10
When you're writing the HTML and CSS because there are grid systems in place
1:50:15
that you can just uh include in your project and it's going to make it much
1:50:21
easier for the developer to create the layouts or build the layouts that you
1:50:26
created in your design. With that said, sometimes grids can add a certain degree
1:50:33
of complexity to a project and you don't really need that complexity, right? For
1:50:40
certain projects, grids are not absolutely necessary. And especially if
1:50:46
you're a beginner, I don't really recommend you would work with a grid system because there are far more
1:50:54
important things to consider when it comes to web design um than you know grids or how
1:51:01
your content is um is placed in the page. So that's why I'm not using grids
1:51:07
in this course. Instead, I'm going to show you a much simpler method for aligning and sizing content. And that's
1:51:15
going to allow you to focus on the more important aspects of um of UI design. So
1:51:22
the technique that I'm going to use is with guides. So I'm going to get rid of
1:51:27
this layout grid. And to activate the guides, you would go to the Figma menu
1:51:34
view. You need to show rulers.
1:51:40
And that's going to uh display these rulers at the top and at the left. And
1:51:46
then you can simply click and drag a guide and just snap it to your content.
1:51:52
And here in red at the very top, it's going to show you uh the exact position of that ruler. You can also click on it.
1:52:00
And then you can do the same, you know, on the other side. And here our ruler is
1:52:07
at 135 pixels. And then you do 1280 minus 135. This gives you 11:45. And
1:52:15
then just grab this and using your arrow keys, just move it into place. So right
1:52:21
now you'll have the exact same distance from both sides. And you can create as
1:52:26
many guides as you want depending on the type of
1:52:34
layout that you want to make. And if you want to hide the rulers and the guides, you can simply press shift R and that's
1:52:41
going to hide both. And you can use this shortcut to toggle uh to toggle the visibility basically. And of course you
1:52:48
can create um horizontal rulers just like this.
1:52:56
And if at any point you want to delete one, simply click on it, select and then uh press the delete key or the backspace
1:53:03
key. And I think this is much easier for a beginner rather than, you know,
1:53:10
getting caught up with grids and, oh, how many columns do I want? What kind of
1:53:15
space do I want? And for a website design that's not
1:53:20
focused heavily on a gridlike layout, using rulers is much much simpler. And
1:53:29
that's what uh we'll be using for this project. Of course, if you want, you can use grids. There's nothing wrong with
1:53:35
that. But if you're just starting out, I recommend uh you start with the uh with
1:53:41
the rulers. All right, let's see some key takeaways from this short lesson.
1:53:47
Spacing and sizing are very important in UI design because they will dictate the
1:53:52
amount of white space and also the visual hierarchy. For spacing and sizing
1:53:58
elements, use the eight point system where every margin, padding, width, etc.
1:54:05
is a multiple of eight. Grids are not always necessary and can sometimes add
1:54:10
an unwanted degree of complexity to a project. Using guides is a perfectly
1:54:15
fine replacement for grids. Now, we don't have a practical exercise for
1:54:22
spacing and sizing uh because I'm going to show you how to apply those principles once we start designing the
1:54:28
various components of our website. And we're actually very close to doing that.
1:54:34
But there is just one last thing I want to to talk about uh before moving on.
1:54:40
And that is uh the proper use of imagery and icons in web design. That's coming
1:54:46
up. All right. So before we start putting
Using icons and images in web design
1:54:52
pixels on the screen, uh I want to give you a few pointers for working with images and icons. First of all, an icon
1:55:01
should be meaningful, right? Because you usually put an icon next to a piece of
1:55:06
text or inside a button. So the icon should visually represent
1:55:13
what the associated text is saying. For example, here we have a button that says
1:55:19
send message, but that check mark icon is not really appropriate, right? It
1:55:26
doesn't exactly represent what the text is saying. But if we replace it with
1:55:31
this icon, then it looks much better, doesn't it? The icon and text work
1:55:37
together to tell a story. Of course, there are standalone icons like the ones
1:55:43
for uh social media, and these work just fine by themselves because uh they're
1:55:51
basically the logos of well-known brands. So, a user seeing those icons
1:55:56
know exactly what they do. Another thing to be careful about when working with
1:56:01
icons is the style. Uh you need to be consistent and use icons with the same
1:56:07
style. They don't have to be from the same icon set as long as they share the
1:56:13
same style whether that is outline, solid, duo tone, etc. In this example, I
1:56:19
have two outline icons and a solid one. See how weird it looks that mismatch? It
1:56:27
will look a lot better when I replace the solid icon with an outline one. Now
1:56:34
everything is nice and consistent. So, be careful about the icon style. Uh
1:56:40
there are plenty of uh highquality icon sets out there and most of them are free. Uh a simple Google search will
1:56:47
give you a bunch of results. Uh and you'll be good to go. Uh however, u I
1:56:53
have a couple of icon sets that I use regularly. They're some of my favorites
1:56:59
and I want to share those with you. First one is Bootstrap icons. Um, if
1:57:05
you're not familiar, Bootstrap is one of the most popular front-end frameworks, and they offer a an icon set called
1:57:13
Bootstrap icons that looks something like this. It's very nice. Over 1,600 icons. It's
1:57:21
free to use. So, I would highly, highly recommend this. Another one is Font
1:57:27
Awesome. This is probably the most popular icon set. There are
1:57:34
14,865 icons in the pro version, which you know is is a paid uh version of the set, but
1:57:43
there's also a free set. And they come in multiple styles like um thin,
1:57:48
regular, and so on. And they also provide a web font that you can use for the icons,
1:57:55
which is awesome. But uh yeah, font awesome another great option. Uh hero
1:58:01
icons. This is a smaller icon set with just 230 and it's licensed MIT so it's
1:58:08
free to use even for commercial projects. Uh these come in two varieties outline and solid. And overall this is a
1:58:16
really really good icon set. Ion icons
1:58:22
again is another set that I recommend. You have uh some different uh options
1:58:29
for the style and you can go ahead and download the free designer pack forge
1:58:36
icons. Really cool icon set. This is actually uh the set that I'm using for
1:58:41
this project. I really like them and they're also free. And then I recommend
1:58:49
you also go to Invato Elements for icons because if you go under uh graphics
1:58:57
icons, you'll find tons and tons of icon sets. And if you have a element
1:59:04
subscription, you can download as many of these as you want. And uh they're really really high
1:59:10
quality sets. And finally, uh it's not really an icon set, but instead it's an
1:59:16
app that allows you to organize icon sets. It's available for both Mac OS and
1:59:22
Windows. It's free and it looks pretty awesome. Let me show you right here.
1:59:28
I've been using this for uh for a while now. This is what it looks like. These are all the icon sets that I saved on my
1:59:37
computer. And whenever I need an icon, I can simply search for one. Let's say
1:59:43
arrow. That's going to give me all the icons that match that search criteria.
1:59:49
And I can search, you know, the various icon sets. I can search for all icons.
1:59:56
And whenever I find one, I can simply copy it from here as SVG or simply as an
2:00:02
icon. I can paste it in my project and I'm good to go. So, I highly recommend
2:00:08
this. It's a free software, crossplatform, and if you're constantly
2:00:13
working with icons, I think it's a no-brainer. Just go ahead and get it. Now, images. Uh, this is a pretty broad
2:00:22
subject because the images you'll be using are directly tied to the text
2:00:27
content, right? But as a general rule, try and stay away from stock photos as
2:00:33
much as possible. Instead, talk to your client and um try and get real pictures.
2:00:41
So, instead of, for example, showing some just random stock photos of fancy
2:00:47
offices and uh you know, the people working in them, get pictures of the
2:00:52
real office of the business and the real people working there. You want to be
2:00:57
genuine, right? Of course, uh stock photos have their place. So, when you want to display an image that's
2:01:04
representing a broad picture of your business type, like say landscaping, you
2:01:09
can get away with grabbing a stock photo or two. The point is, try and keep it as
2:01:15
real as possible. It's very jarring, at least for me, uh, to see, for example, a
2:01:20
business website that shows, you know, stock businessmen, you know, with fake
2:01:26
smiles, uh, shaking hands or pretending to explain something on their laptop
2:01:32
screen. Just don't get me started on that. Keep it real. All right. So, let's see what
2:01:39
we have learned from this lesson. Uh, icons should be meaningful and use a
2:01:45
consistent style throughout. Some icons work just fine by themselves, for
2:01:50
example, social icons, but usually you want to pair them with text. Use stock
2:01:57
photos sparingly and avoid the cheesy, overused, cliche ones. Whenever
2:02:03
possible, use photos that are provided by the client. Keep it real. And with
2:02:09
that, we conclude the initial theory part of this course. Now, it's time to
2:02:15
roll our sleeves and get to work. And we'll start by looking at common
2:02:21
patterns. Um, if you're confused by the term common patterns, well, it's
2:02:27
actually very simple. So, a pattern is something that's repeating itself, right? And in web design, a pattern is
2:02:37
a solution to a common problem. Example, uh let's say you want to
2:02:44
display multiple blocks of similar content in a very small area. How do you
2:02:51
do that? Well, the answer would be tabs, right? So tabs because they're very
2:02:57
effective became the solution to this very common problem. They became a common pattern.
2:03:06
Okay. So for the next 18 or so lessons, we'll uh look at some of these common
2:03:13
patterns. We'll uh um try to define them. We'll take a look at some real
2:03:19
world examples. So what other people are using these patterns for and then we'll
2:03:26
apply that pattern to our project. Ready? Let's start with headers.
Definition and use cases for headers
2:03:34
[Music] Before we design a header, let's look at
2:03:40
what it is. A website header is usually the top section of a web page that
2:03:45
contains the logo, navigation menu, a call to action, and optionally a search
2:03:51
form. Now, this is a generic definition and it depicts a typical header. Uh because of
2:03:58
that, you can distort this structure and adapt it to your needs. So, for example,
2:04:04
maybe you don't have a search form in the header. That's totally fine. Maybe the call to action and the navigation is
2:04:12
hidden or are hidden under a menu button. Also, uh headers are typically
2:04:18
horizontal, but they can also be vertical. And I think that as long as uh that top area
2:04:26
of a web page contains a logo or some kind of brand identifier and a
2:04:32
navigation, it can be considered a header. Now, let's take a look at some
2:04:37
real world examples and see the commonalities uh but more importantly
2:04:43
the differences. We're going to start with one of my favorite websites uh that's Stripe. And here we see a very
2:04:51
simple header. We have the logo, the navigation, which looks fantastic by the way, and
2:05:00
also the call to action. Now some people say that this area here is also part of
2:05:07
the header. Uh personally I call this the hero area. So it's something separate. But there are those who say
2:05:15
that the entire area that's above the fold or in this case you know from here to
2:05:23
the top uh that's part of the header. They might be right. Um, I don't think
2:05:28
there's an exact definition of where a header should start and where it should end. Uh, personally, I I just consider a
2:05:36
header the uh the very top area of the website. Uh, let's go to the next
2:05:42
website for Adidas. Now, this has a slightly more complex header. We of
2:05:48
course see the uh the logo, the navigation. Uh here we have a search bar and we also
2:05:56
have some distinct controls for the shop because this also has a web shop. So we
2:06:04
can see a link to probably the user account or the profile uh the list of
2:06:09
favorites and the cart. Uh this header also features some extra links here for
2:06:17
various sections of the website and also um kind of an information or a promotional bar right here at the top
2:06:25
with uh you know offers and then some information about shipping and returns
2:06:32
and also another promotional bit here. So yeah, very similar to the one that we
2:06:38
saw on Stripe, but also very different because it features a lot more elements.
2:06:45
Uh, next we have the header from Dribble. And here again we have the logo
2:06:50
and navigation, but also a search bar, a call to action, and also controls or
2:06:56
links to access various sections of the website. So, as you can see, the headers
2:07:02
kind of change their structure depending on the type of website they're being
2:07:08
displayed on, but at their core, they feature roughly the same elements.
2:07:14
Here's another example from KBD Fans. Search, logo,
2:07:21
shop, links, and then main navigation. And then also an announcement bar right
2:07:28
here on the top. just like we saw on Adidas. Next up,
2:07:33
let's take a look at the Amazon header. So, again, a lot of stuff crammed into
2:07:39
here, but with some of these headers, you can really see the main focus or the main purpose of that. And in the case of
2:07:46
Amazon, it's this big search bar here. So, they want people to to use this
2:07:51
header to search for stuff on their website. And again roughly similar
2:07:56
structure, logo, navigation, search, uh cart, so web shop, um elements. And here
2:08:05
we also have a language switcher. Pretty interesting. Next, uh we have the header
2:08:11
for Invato Elements. Again, we can see where the focus is on the navigation and
2:08:18
also on the search, right? So, it's much more beneficial to have a big search
2:08:24
form on a website like this where you go and where you go to find certain
2:08:30
elements, certain assets and stuff rather than using a very small search
2:08:36
field like we do in dribble. Next, we have uh the website of Simon Gets.
2:08:44
Pardon me if I mispronounced your name, Simon. So here we don't really have a
2:08:50
header, but instead we have this bit here, which kind of acts like a header,
2:08:56
but it also acts like a hero area. So it's kind of a mix between the two. We
2:09:01
don't really have a navigation here. Uh we just have the brand identifier, which is the name, and then we have a
2:09:10
description of who that person is and what they do. So this is actually a
2:09:16
really really cool website. So as you can see, not all websites need
2:09:22
that header with logo navigation and call to action. You can you can distort
2:09:28
that structure and adapt it to your needs. As I was saying, uh here's another website. Now, this features a
2:09:35
vertical header and you know it's part vertical actually part horizontal
2:09:40
because we have the logo here horizontal but the rest is here vertical and we
2:09:48
have some um some links here for contact and projects and then a link to the menu
2:09:55
and then some social media icons. So, this is a pretty unusual um use for a
2:10:02
header. And finally, we have um this website for Irene Studio. It's probably
2:10:10
pronounced differently in French. Uh but this is a very simple header. We have
2:10:17
the logo and then a menu button, which if we press,
2:10:22
it's going to show us the menu. And technically this kind of um modal window
2:10:30
that's being presented to us here is also part of the header because it shows
2:10:36
us the uh the navigation uh some links here. We have a language
2:10:41
switcher. So even though you know it's not your typical header that's displayed
2:10:46
horizontally like this uh I believe that it's still part of the header because it
2:10:51
contains the navigation. So there you go. a few examples of headers,
2:10:58
how they're being implemented in some real websites, and hopefully that gave you some inspiration for
2:11:06
uh creating your own. All right, let's see some key takeaways. A website header
2:11:12
is usually the top section of a web page that contains the logo, navigation menu,
2:11:18
a call to action, and optionally a search form. A header is highly customizable and can hold other types of
2:11:25
content. Headers can also be vertical. All right, so now that we have a general
2:11:31
idea of what a header is and what we can do with it, let's go ahead and create one for our project. That's coming up.
Let’s design a header
2:11:42
To design the header, I'll use the wireframe as a starting point. And because I'm working in Figma, I'll be
2:11:49
using the auto layout feature pretty heavily. But don't worry, I'll explain how it works uh as we're building stuff
2:11:56
with it. So, let's go. So, I created a new page in Figma where I placed all the
2:12:05
wireframes. And this should be your starting point as well. And what I'm going to do is
2:12:12
simply copy the index page, go to my design page
2:12:17
and paste it in. So now I can work directly on the wireframe. Right? I
2:12:24
think this is much easier because you make the wireframe in Figma and then you copy it into your final design page and
2:12:32
you start working directly on it. You don't have to recreate any element. It's
2:12:37
all there. All you have to do is play around with colors, typography, spacing,
2:12:43
and sizing, which is pretty awesome. So, let's start with the logo. I'm going to
2:12:50
delete this one, and I'm just going to paste in the logo. I'm going to choose
2:12:55
32 pixels as its height. Remember the eight point system. Yeah. And then I
2:13:02
need to know where I'm going to position this logo from the edges, right? So, I'm going to bring up my rulers. Shift R and
2:13:09
I'm going to drag a ruler to 64 pixels.
2:13:17
64 like that. And then I'll just align the logo to that ruler. Next, what do we have? We
2:13:25
have the menu about me and contact.
2:13:31
Now, I already created um a frame with auto layout for this menu. as you can
2:13:37
see here. But let me show you exactly what that does.
2:13:44
So let's say that I have two elements, right? This and this. Two text elements.
2:13:50
And I want to position them in the same group. So they're perfectly aligned
2:13:57
and they also have a consistent spacing between them. Now, if I were to create a simple group with these with command G,
2:14:04
whenever I would change one of them,
2:14:09
nothing would happen really. The first link would just overlap the other one.
2:14:15
And I can also, you know, move these around and nothing really would change. The group would just resize along with
2:14:22
them. But with auto layout, things are very different.
2:14:28
So, let's select these two again. Let's ungroup them.
2:14:33
And with them selected, I'm going to click on the plus under auto layout. You
2:14:39
can also go to um object add auto layout or shift A.
2:14:46
And that's going to create a separate frame for these two elements. And then I can
2:14:52
go in here and I can say okay I want 16 pixels or maybe you know 32 pixels
2:14:59
between elements and I can also make sure they are
2:15:06
aligned properly by using these controls here. So now if I change one of them,
2:15:16
Figma will automatically keep the same distance of 32 pixels between these
2:15:22
items. And by the way, I'm holding down the option key and hovering on this
2:15:28
element to learn the distance between these two. It's a very handy feature. Now, for this particular project, I
2:15:36
would like the menu to be positioned right next to my logo. So, in the wireframe, it's positioned in the
2:15:42
middle, but I think it would work much better if it was positioned right here.
2:15:49
So, what I can do is I can grab the logo and I can simply drop it in to frame 19.
2:15:54
And that positioned it right at the very end. But I can use my arrow keys left
2:16:02
to bring it into the position I want. And because this auto layout frame
2:16:09
is set to align items vertically, everything is aligned automatically for
2:16:15
me. And of course, I can change it like this, like this,
2:16:20
and so on. But I prefer vertical. And I'm also going to change the spacing to
2:16:25
64 pixels. again a multiple of eight. So then let me just bring this and align
2:16:32
it with the grid or with the uh with the guides. And now let's start working on
2:16:39
these two links. Let's go back to our assets and check out our typography.
2:16:45
We can see that the lowest element here is heading 6 which has a font size of 21
2:16:53
pixels. So let's use that. Select these two. We'll use Proximanova
2:17:01
bold 21 and 30 for line height. Now just
2:17:06
looking at this I find that these links are a bit too big. So I'm going to reduce their size. Now if you remember
2:17:14
from the typography example we used a type scale right of 1.414
2:17:21
and 21 pixels was the base font size. So if we're missing one of the sizes here,
2:17:29
we can just do it ourselves. We can say 21 divided by 1.414.
2:17:38
And it's actually like this. And it gives us 14.85.
2:17:43
And we'll just round that off to 15. So let's do that. And I'm also going to
2:17:50
lower the line height to 24 pixels. again a multiple of eight and that will
2:17:56
give us the final properties for the menu items. Now what about color? Let's
2:18:03
select both of these and I'm going to set the color to black and I'm going to
2:18:09
show this as a list. So select black from this list. Awesome. What's next? We
2:18:17
have the social media icons. Now, for the social media icons, I'm
2:18:23
actually going to use icons from a different icon set called Forge icons,
2:18:28
which are these right here. So, I'm going to search for Twitter.
2:18:34
Click and drag here. And I'm going to resize this to be 32 pixels. Now by resizing it
2:18:43
like this we actually encountered a small problem because uh be the icon
2:18:50
uses um kind of a stroke for uh for the lines. So whenever I resize it using
2:18:56
that method the stroke just keeps getting thicker and thicker. So if you
2:19:02
run into this problem and you have issues resizing an element in uh in Figma, you can scale it
2:19:11
like so or pressing the K keyboard shortcut and then holding shift
2:19:18
click and drag until you get it to the desired size, which in my case is 32
2:19:24
pixels. Okay. Uh what else? We had uh Instagram
2:19:30
and dribble. So, let's grab those
2:19:38
again. K. And resize this to 32.
2:19:44
Like that. And finally, dribble.
2:19:51
And this is actually a bad rendering of that icon. See how
2:19:56
the lines are kind of messed up here? Uh, Figma does that sometimes, unfortunately. It's one of its
2:20:02
drawbacks. It doesn't render correctly some uh some SVGs. So, in that case,
2:20:08
we're going to have to look for our icon elsewhere. So, I'm going to search for
2:20:14
dribble here. And as you can see, we can find roughly the same icon in uh in Font
2:20:22
Awesome. So this was the one that we're planning to use
2:20:29
and this is the one from Font Awesome. So let's grab that. It has the same style which is outline
2:20:36
and this is a much bigger icon by default. So let's just resize it like so
2:20:44
to 32 pixels like that. And we might need to tweak it
2:20:50
a little bit because these icons here, they have kind of this padding. Twitter
2:20:56
does as well, but this is uh Oops.
2:21:01
This is a bit different. So, we're just going to have to gently resize it until
2:21:07
they're roughly the same uh the same size here. So, let's also grab
2:21:17
a guide and align them like that. And one here.
2:21:24
And let's resize the Twitter icon as well
2:21:31
to something like that. Okay. So, now we can go ahead and delete these two guides
2:21:38
and we can grab these icons. Shift A to create an auto layout. Align them
2:21:44
properly in the middle. And we're going to set 32 pixels of distance between them, like so. And then let's move them
2:21:52
to the left a little bit. And let's go ahead and leave a 64 pixel gap like
2:22:01
that. Be uh between this and the edge. And then we can even drag a guide right
2:22:08
there. Okay, so those are the social icons. So, our header is starting to
2:22:14
take shape. Uh, let's see about this line here. This is a separator. And I'm
2:22:20
going to keep it, but I'm going to change it stroke color. And I'm going to
2:22:26
use black, probably black 10. I think that looks pretty good. So, it's just
2:22:31
it's barely visible, but it's still there. And just so we don't forget,
2:22:36
let's select uh these icons. And Figma has this awesome feature. When you
2:22:42
select more than one element, it gives you all the colors that are present in
2:22:47
that selection. So I can change the color of multiple elements at the same time.
2:22:53
So I'm going to use black for these as well. So our defined black color. Now
2:22:59
let's take a look at our header. See what else it needs. So, it looks pretty good. But one thing that's bothering me
2:23:05
is that this contact information is here in the hero area. And I think it would
2:23:12
work better if it was placed here next to these social media icons because
2:23:18
they're both ways to contact Robert Fox. So, it would make more sense to have the
2:23:25
contact information here in the header where it's more visible rather than
2:23:31
here. So, what I'm going to do is grab these two. Command X
2:23:41
and I'm going to paste them here. For fill, I'm going to use black. But
2:23:48
for the email, because I want this to be a link, I'm going to use the primary
2:23:53
like so. I'm going to select them, shift A to create an auto layout frame,
2:23:59
and I'm going to select 32 pixels. Align them vertically like so. And then I'm
2:24:05
going to select this and this, shift A again to create another auto layout
2:24:11
frame using all of these elements. And I'm going to select 64 pixels
2:24:18
distance between these. And I'm also going to align them in the middle like
2:24:24
so. And I'm just going to make sure that the alignment there is correct. On
2:24:30
top of that, I want to add a small separator between this section and this
2:24:37
section. So I'm going to select this frame. Press L for line tool. Click and
2:24:46
drag while holding down shift. I'm going to create a small
2:24:54
line that's one pixel wide and 16 pixels in width. And for the
2:25:01
stroke color, I'm going to select black 25.
2:25:07
And because I used auto layout, simply by inserting that element into the
2:25:14
parent frame, all the other elements were pushed aside to make room for it. So now we have this bit which sits
2:25:22
nicely at 64 pixels between the left side and the right
2:25:27
side. Now I also want to add some top
2:25:33
padding and bottom padding for this section. So, I'm going to select this
2:25:38
and then this. And I'm going to group them up. Shift A to add an auto layout
2:25:46
on all of these sections. And I want to make sure they are properly aligned at
2:25:51
all times. And here's a cool thing in Figma.
2:25:57
Right now, Figma automatically set a 486 pixel spacing between these items.
2:26:06
But what I can do is I can select the parent element and I can set the item distribution to
2:26:15
space between instead of packed. And that will basically push one element to
2:26:22
the left. So the this left side will be pushed to the left and this right side
2:26:27
will always be pushed to the right regardless of the size of the parent which is
2:26:35
fantastic. Now what I can also do is I can set a
2:26:42
padding on the top of 32 pixels and a padding on the bottom of 32
2:26:49
pixels. And I can grab this element and align it at the
2:26:55
top of the page. So now I can take this, I can move it down.
2:27:04
So I now have my 32 pixel padding on all elements. That's pretty cool,
2:27:11
isn't it? And now I can grab this element and this element and I can group them up as
2:27:18
header. And that's it. And now for for instance, if I want to change the size
2:27:25
of this header, all the elements stay exactly where they need to. This is one
2:27:31
of the uh awesome things about Figma auto layout. And that's our header.
2:27:38
Okay, now it's your turn. So go ahead and design the header for your version of the website. And you can use my
2:27:45
design, that's totally fine. or you can create your own. Maybe you want the
2:27:50
navigation to be centered. Maybe you don't want the contact information to be
2:27:57
there. Maybe you don't want the social icons to be there. You know, play around with it. Create your own version. Put
2:28:05
your own spin on uh on the project. Now, after the header, we can usually find a
2:28:12
hero area. So, let's see about that coming up.
Definition and use cases for hero areas
2:28:19
Hero sections were once considered to be a passing trend, but they actually stuck
2:28:24
very well in uh in web design, and nowadays pretty much every website uses
2:28:31
one. A hero is the area immediately below or next to the header. Because
2:28:37
this is positioned above the fold, it's considered prime real estate. So, it
2:28:43
displays critical information like the brand offering, benefits for working with the brand, and a call to action. A
2:28:51
lot of websites use sliders in the hero area to display, for example, articles
2:28:58
if we're talking about an online magazine or maybe offers and products if
2:29:05
uh it's an online store. But generally speaking, a hero area usually contains
2:29:12
uh a strong message along with a call to action uh and then some supporting media
2:29:18
like images and videos. So let's see some realworld examples. The first one
2:29:24
is from Stripe. Again, one of my favorite websites. And here the hero
2:29:32
area is this one above the fold. And on
2:29:37
this website, the hero contains, you know, the strong message, in our case,
2:29:43
payments infrastructure for the internet, a small description, call to action, and then supporting media in the
2:29:50
form of these images. And of course, we have this uh amazing shifting uh
2:29:56
gradient background that uh really adds to uh to the whole experience. Let's look at another one.
2:30:03
This is from site ground. Again, we have the message, description, call to
2:30:10
action. We have also some pricing information here and a supporting image.
2:30:16
Uh, Invato Elements has a slightly different
2:30:21
hero area here. Uh, they showcase free courses. uh they have a counter for you
2:30:28
know how many items were added this week and also provide links to illustrations
2:30:35
to fonts. So it's very much tailored to what the website has to offer. You know
2:30:41
if it was like an online store it would probably present some products or
2:30:47
special offers. Well, here it's displaying
2:30:52
links to categories, to certain items, and so on. Uh, monday.com
2:30:59
has a slightly different hero area. Again, we have the strong message, but the call to action here is a bit
2:31:07
different than the rest because you basically uh can select a bunch of these uh elements
2:31:14
and uh it's a really cool technique. Here, the gradient actually changes as
2:31:20
I'm selecting or deselecting multiple categories.
2:31:26
Pretty cool. Um, so you're basically selecting a bunch of these and then you
2:31:33
get started and that's going to take you, you know, to a signup page and moving forward to uh to an experience
2:31:40
that's tailored uh to you based on what you selected. um earlier. Very
2:31:47
interesting. Uh craft has a very simplistic minimalistic uh hero area,
2:31:55
strong message, call to action, and then a small announcement here.
2:32:01
And then uh timely has um something similar. So again, the message, the call
2:32:07
to action, which in this case asks for any email address. we have the
2:32:12
supporting uh media and then also some benefits for signing up which is really
2:32:20
really good. So that's a sample of a couple of hero areas from real websites
2:32:27
just to show you kind of an overall structure and what you can expect from
2:32:32
this kind of common pattern. Now let's see some key takeaways. A hero is the
2:32:39
area immediately below or next to the header because it's positioned above the
2:32:44
fold. A hero is considered prime real estate, so it displays critical
2:32:49
information. A lot of hero areas show sliders, but usually they display a
2:32:55
strong message and a call to action. All right, so now that we have an idea of what hero areas are all about, let's go
2:33:02
ahead and design one for our website. coming up.
Let’s design a hero area
2:33:09
Okay. So, previously we designed the header for the website of Robert Fox.
2:33:15
And if we look at the wireframe, right below that, we can find a hero area. So,
2:33:21
let's take that and work our magic. The first thing I'll do is actually resize
2:33:27
this index page to 1,800 in width. I forgot to do it uh last time.
2:33:33
And then I'll simply resize this bit. And I'll reposition the guide like so.
2:33:40
And then I'll add some extra guides here. And those guides will help me size
2:33:46
up the content for this hero area. So I'm going to add the first guide at 256,
2:33:53
which is a multiple of 8, like so.
2:34:00
And then another one on the other side. And that's going to be placed at
2:34:07
1544 just like that. So now we have 256
2:34:13
pixels of distance between or on the right side and on the left side of the
2:34:19
page. So now for this element we're going to use an H3 H3 that we defined
2:34:26
here in the typography stage and we created a text style for it. So let's go
2:34:32
back and choose H3 from here. And as for the fill
2:34:40
color, I'm going to use the brand gradient. Then this is the main message. So, I'm
2:34:48
going to choose an H1.
2:34:53
And for color, I'll choose black. And let's resize this a little bit. And
2:34:58
also, let's make a bit of room. I'm going to select some of these
2:35:03
elements. I'm going to make this a lot bigger.
2:35:08
And I'm going to select this. And I'm just going to push it down like
2:35:15
so. And I'm using the arrow keys while holding down shift. And also, I don't think I'll be needing this line here, so
2:35:22
we'll just delete it. Next up, I'll grab the text
2:35:28
and I'll choose the paragraph style for it. And for fill color, we'll go with
2:35:34
black 75. And that's what I like to usually do. Headings, I usually leave
2:35:40
them on the black color that we defined. But for
2:35:46
regular text, I go with a bit of opacity. In this case, 75%.
2:35:51
Just so there is a bit of contrast between the lighter text or the smaller text and the bigger text. Then I'll uh
2:35:59
select this text and I'll resize it to fit within my guides like so. And this
2:36:05
is actually an a group. So let's ungroup this for now.
2:36:12
and ungroup this. And let's properly resize it like that.
2:36:20
And now what I can do is select all of this, shift A
2:36:26
to add auto layout. And I'm going to select 32 pixels of spacing between
2:36:32
these items. And I'm going to align everything to the middle like that.
2:36:40
Then I can also play around with the uh with the width of this text element.
2:36:47
Maybe make it something like that. A little bit bigger so it the text fits
2:36:53
in two lines. So with that done, the only thing left
2:36:59
to do here is work on this button. Uh, we'll do that in a future lesson. But
2:37:04
for now, I want to add a bit more spacing between the button and this text.
2:37:11
So, because that diff that distance is higher than 32 pixels, which I have set
2:37:18
right here in my auto layout, we can do the following. We can select the text
2:37:24
and the button. Shift A to create its own group with auto layout. align
2:37:31
everything to the middle and then we'll set this distance to 96 pixels.
2:37:39
96 is also a multiple of eight. So I'm using the eight point system in all
2:37:45
aspects of this design. And finally we need a bit of uh breathing room a bit of
2:37:52
distance between the contents of uh this hero area and the element above which is
2:37:59
the header. Currently, this distance is 141,
2:38:04
but I'm going to move this to 256.
2:38:11
And I'm going to remember this number because that's the distance I'll be
2:38:18
using between all major sections of the website. So, 256.
2:38:24
And with that, my hero area is almost done. We just need to make this button,
2:38:30
but that's for the next lesson. Cool, Beans. So, now it's your turn to design
2:38:36
the hero area. And you can do it in any way you want so that it fits whatever
2:38:42
style you've been using so far. If it's exactly the same as mine, great.
2:38:47
Otherwise, uh be more adventurous with it. And also you can use the examples
2:38:53
uh of hero areas that I showed you previously for uh some added inspiration. Now let's see about that uh
2:39:01
that button that was left unfinished. Uh so let's give it the final coat of paint
2:39:07
that's coming up. I think everybody knows by now what a
Definition and use cases for buttons
2:39:14
button is, but just in case, let's do a quick recap. In UI design, a button is a
2:39:21
fundamental interactive element that serves as a middleman between the user and the product or service. That's
2:39:28
because buttons are gateways, right? You click a button and it takes you to a
2:39:35
different page. For example, you land or you open a landing page and by clicking
2:39:42
the button in the hero area, it takes you to the signup form for that service
2:39:48
or the um the product page for that product.
2:39:55
And buttons can also perform certain actions like for example toggling the visibility of an element uh doing
2:40:02
something in the back end or um you know opening a window in that page. So
2:40:08
they're really versatile. They're not used only for navigation. Uh with that
2:40:14
said, let's take a look at some realworld examples. Here we have the website of Avacode and
2:40:22
we have a couple different buttons. Let's take it from the top. This one will basically take us somewhere else as
2:40:29
do these two. So these two are actually part of the call to action. Uh we also
2:40:37
have two other buttons here for cookies. And by clicking these,
2:40:43
they perform an action, right? They close that UI element. We also have a
2:40:50
button here that says start free trial. This is also part of the main call to
2:40:55
action from the hero area. Here's another button that's not used for navigation. This opens up a popup for
2:41:03
this support module and this closes it. What about
2:41:08
this website for notion? So on the login page, we have uh three buttons here that
2:41:14
will basically take us somewhere else or perform a certain action. But if we go to the main website again, we have a
2:41:22
button that closes that popup and the rest are used for the call to action.
2:41:28
They will take us somewhere else. Same goes for the Adidas website. We have
2:41:36
three buttons here for the call to action. But if we look here, we also have two buttons
2:41:43
that don't really take us anywhere else, but instead they perform
2:41:48
a specific action in the UI, in which case they cycle through a bunch of
2:41:54
slides. And if we scroll further down, we can see some other buttons that will
2:42:00
take us to other pages. Here we have a button that opens up filtering and
2:42:05
stuff. And as you can see, we have several visual styles for buttons. So
2:42:12
these that you saw up here, they have a certain style.
2:42:18
These here, they have a certain style. These have a
2:42:24
certain style. And also these have another different style. These are with text and icon. So within the same
2:42:31
website, you can have two, three, four different styles of buttons. Let's see
2:42:38
another example. Uh the timely website. Right off the bat, we can see two
2:42:43
buttons for the call to action. Right? So they share roughly the same style,
2:42:50
but they have small tweaks to them depending on where they are. So the
2:42:55
button in the header is white and it turns green on hover. Uh the button in
2:43:02
the hero is a darker color and then turns green on hover. So you know
2:43:08
they're different but they also share some common features
2:43:14
like for example the hover color. They're both rounded. They use the same font and so on and so forth. What about
2:43:22
YouTube? YouTube has a lot of buttons in its interface. All you got to do is hover on a specific video and you have
2:43:29
two buttons here for watch later and add to cube. If you open a specific um
2:43:37
video, there are a couple more buttons here on the video player. Play, next
2:43:44
one, make full screen, theater mode, uh this uh default view and so on. So as
2:43:51
you can see buttons are really versatile elements and they can be used for both
2:43:58
navigation and also for performing certain actions in the back end. For
2:44:04
example, if I click the save button here, that's going to save it to my watch later list and that's performing
2:44:11
an action in the back end. So a few key takeaways in UI design. A button is a
2:44:18
fundamental interactive element that serves as a middleman between the user and the product or service. Buttons are
2:44:26
not used solely for navigation. They can perform various actions like toggling an
2:44:32
element's visibility, performing a task in the back end, etc. All right. So, now
2:44:37
that we saw some use cases for buttons, let's turn our attention to the buttons
2:44:43
in our project that's coming up. [Music]
Let’s design some buttons
2:44:49
My hero area is incomplete at the moment because I still need to design that button. So while I do that, I'll also uh
2:44:57
give you some tips and tricks for designing good looking buttons and also usable buttons. Let's begin. So let's uh
2:45:05
zoom in here. The first thing I'll do is set the typography properly. So, I'm
2:45:11
going to be using Proximanova uh 21 and 30, I believe it was. Let's
2:45:18
double check in our typography stuff. So, the H6 is
2:45:26
2130. Yes, 21 representing the font size, 30 representing the line height.
2:45:34
And I'm also going to make it bold. And then I'm going to change this arrow
2:45:40
because it's just hideous. So, let's go ahead and delete that. And I'll open my
2:45:46
icon set app. And we're going to pick a nice uh icon. I'm going to be using the
2:45:51
forge icon set. So, let's search for an arrow. Let's see what we can find here.
2:45:58
Maybe down. There we go. So, I'm going to be using downward. Click, drag, paste
2:46:06
it in. And as you can see, this is already inside a frame that has auto layout. I'm
2:46:12
just going to use a 16 pixel gap between these two elements. And I'm going to
2:46:19
resize the icon uh using K. And I'm going to make it 32 pixels like
2:46:28
that. Then I'm going to select my parent
2:46:33
frame and I'm going to give it a fill of brand gradient.
2:46:39
I'm going to round off its corners. Let's say like 100. That's going to create a pill button. And I'm going to
2:46:46
add some padding. Because I'm using auto layout, this is super super simple. So,
2:46:52
I'm going to be using 24 pixels top and bottom, 48 pixels
2:46:59
left and right. And this is how I like to make my buttons. Basically, whatever
2:47:04
padding I set on the top and bottom, I double it on the left and right. And
2:47:11
this creates a nice visual balance. Then with the button selected,
2:47:17
as you can see, I'm using the brand gradient as the background, but the
2:47:24
other color is black. So, I'm going to actually swap this to white. Just like
2:47:29
that. Finally, I want to give this button a bit more emphasis. You know, I
2:47:36
want it to stand out. So, one way I can do that is by adding a shadow, a drop
2:47:42
shadow. So I can select the button and I can go to effects and use the drop
2:47:48
shadow from here. I can also click this button and change its properties.
2:47:54
But actually I have a a very nice Figma plugin that's called smooth shadow and
2:48:01
that basically adds layered shadows to elements.
2:48:07
And you can you know play around with the different layers here. You can play
2:48:13
with the offset, the blur, the alpha,
2:48:21
right? And this creates a very very nice shadow. Uh, personally, I just leave it
2:48:27
at default. So, let's run that again. Smooth shadow. And I'm going to apply it.
2:48:34
And if we zoom out, you can see that we have a very nice, very subtle shadow
2:48:41
applied to that element. So, our button is almost complete. But here's a quick
2:48:47
tip. Uh, whenever you're designing a button, there are a few things you need
2:48:53
to keep in mind to make it usable and to make it look good. First of all, you need to make it look clickable and easy
2:49:00
to find. And I do that by using this bright color or colors because I'm using
2:49:07
a gradient. So it does look like a button with the rounded edges and stuff.
2:49:13
And it's also really easy to find because if we get a bird's eyee view of
2:49:19
what we've done so far, this button immediately stands out, right? Because it's so colored and because it has a
2:49:27
nice size to it. And size is also important. You need to make uh this button easy to click but also more
2:49:35
importantly easy to tap on a mobile device because uh the human finger is a
2:49:41
lot bigger than a cursor. So you need to make it large enough to be able to be
2:49:47
easily tapped with the finger on a mobile device screen. And finally you
2:49:53
need to tell the user what the button is doing. In my case, I want this button to
2:49:58
scroll the page to the portfolio section. So that's why I used this
2:50:07
downward arrow and also the text see my work and the because my work is further
2:50:15
down the page. Looking at this, the user can, you know,
2:50:21
automatically deduce that, hey, if I'm going to click on this button, it's going to take me somewhere down because
2:50:26
of the because of the icon. But the wording is also very important. So,
2:50:32
whenever you're creating buttons, uh, be explicit. Tell the user what that button
2:50:38
is doing. Now before we wrap up this lesson, there are a few more steps we
2:50:44
need to take to make sure that our design is ready to be sent to the developer. And when it comes to
2:50:50
interactive elements, we must also consider the different states that
2:50:55
element can be in. So for example, what happens when I mouse over this button?
2:51:03
It needs to change somehow, right? What about when I click it? What about when
2:51:08
it's a disabled button? So, let's go ahead and cover those things right now.
2:51:14
So, what I'll do is I'll copy my button. I'll go back to my assets
2:51:19
and I'll create a new frame here and I'll paste in that button.
2:51:25
So, this will be my default state. Then, I'm going to duplicate it and I'm going
2:51:32
to create my hover state. And I think it would be interesting on hover to kind of
2:51:38
increase the distance between these two elements, between the text and the icon.
2:51:45
So instead of 16, I'll use 24, an 8 pixel increase.
2:51:53
Now, this also increases the size of my button, and maybe I don't want that. So
2:52:00
I need to take that difference and subtract half
2:52:05
of it from each side. So because I'm using 48 pixels of
2:52:10
padding, I'm going to say 44 and 44. So now I'll have the exact same
2:52:18
size for the button on hover. Of course, we have different sizes here because the
2:52:24
text is different. But if I change this to default, you'll see that the width is
2:52:32
267. 267. So I hope that made sense. On hover, we just increase the distance
2:52:39
between text and icon and we deduce that
2:52:44
increase from the left and right padding. So the button stays exactly the same size.
2:52:51
Uh what about the active? when you click on the button. Right? So, we have the hover state here. We're going to use
2:52:58
that as a template. We're going to call it active state. And when I click it, I
2:53:04
want a more visual change. Right? So, I'm going to select the background. And
2:53:12
one thing I can do is decrease the opacity to like 80%.
2:53:18
All right? So that's an immediate visual differentiation between uh when it's hovered and when it's clicked. And
2:53:25
finally when it's disabled because we might have instances when we need a
2:53:31
button to be disabled. I'm going to bring back the opacity to 100%. But
2:53:37
instead of this brand gradient, I'm going to choose my primary color.
2:53:43
I'm going to give it a solid color. And then I'm going to create a tone for
2:53:51
that color. Something like that. So something that's more towards gray.
2:53:59
Maybe even like this. And I think that would work just fine. On top of this, we
2:54:06
can also create a secondary style for the button, right? So one that's not as
2:54:12
emphasized as the default one. So, for that, I'm just going to duplicate this
2:54:18
again. I'm going to get rid of the shadows. Remember, we want this to be a bit more
2:54:25
subdued. And instead of using a gradient at as its background, we're
2:54:31
actually going to use a solid white color and use a stroke instead. And we
2:54:39
can actually make the stroke the gradient like that. Or we can simply use
2:54:46
a primary or a secondary color. Or we can use the black. And that's exactly
2:54:51
what I'm going to do. So use the black. Make this a little bit thicker. And also
2:54:56
the text inside should also use black. But I'm going to
2:55:02
select black 75. Oops. And that also colored the button. So we don't want
2:55:08
that. I just want the text and the icon to have that color. So, that's the
2:55:15
default state. Let's create a hover state. For the hover, how about we
2:55:21
switch things around? How about we uh add a fill
2:55:27
that's using the black color? And for the text,
2:55:32
we'll use white. And let's also give this an opacity of
2:55:37
about 85%. So I don't want like pure white on a
2:55:42
dark background. Just tone it down a little bit. Active state is for
2:55:49
when you press it down. In which case, let's swap the black for black 75. And
2:55:57
disabled. How about we do the border black 50,
2:56:03
the text black 25 or the uh the fill
2:56:09
and the text uh let's make this black 75
2:56:14
or even less than that black 50
2:56:20
something like that. So that should um should be a hover state. Pretty easy,
2:56:25
right? I think it's an important part of the process of designing a button. You
2:56:31
need to consider, okay, this is my button, but I also need to add these
2:56:36
various states. But what if I need to add another button in the future that
2:56:43
may be not as important as my primary? That's why you create a secondary style.
2:56:49
But the secondary style should be more subdued. It shouldn't be as emphasized as um the
2:56:57
main button. All right. So now it's your turn to design the buttons for your
2:57:03
version of the project. Just remember as I kept saying uh take care of those uh
2:57:10
secondary styles for the button and also the different states hover, active,
2:57:15
disabled and so on. Uh, with that said, let's move on to the next pattern on our
2:57:22
list, and that is image galleries. I'll see you soon.
Definition and use cases for image galleries
2:57:30
All right, let's talk about image galleries. And I think the name is pretty self-explanatory.
2:57:36
An image gallery is a way of displaying a collection of images while allowing users to see several items at once. It's
2:57:44
great for photography websites, but also for online stores, for example, because
2:57:49
you can view variations of a product or multiple angles of the same product. And
2:57:57
uh image galleries are also can be linked with a slideshow that allows you
2:58:02
to view bigger versions of the same image. And you know, you usually control
2:58:09
that slideshow with your mouse or with your keyboard. So, um, let's see some examples of image, uh, galleries. Here
2:58:17
we are back on the Adidas website. And if we open up one of these categories
2:58:24
and we open a product, we can see an image gallery right here. So, we can use
2:58:31
the controls to view, you know, the same product from various angles. I can also
2:58:38
use the arrows here. I can click and kind of
2:58:43
move around, see a kind of a blown up version of the
2:58:48
product. I can also click this bit and that's going to show me an even bigger
2:58:53
picture. Right? So, that's one use of an image slideshow. Uh what about this
2:58:59
website for Groveade? Well, this also has an image gallery
2:59:04
right here, but it's uh a little bit different. Uh, you simply drag with your
2:59:10
mouse and it's going to show you the images from the slideshow. Pretty
2:59:17
cool. You can also click
2:59:23
and that's going to cycle through them. Here's another example. This is for like
2:59:29
a real real estate website. And if you scroll all the way down, here is a nice
2:59:38
gallery with some uh interesting uh hover effects. And I can also cycle through these like so.
2:59:45
So very nicely done. This is a very very smooth gallery.
2:59:51
Uh here is another one. Right, you have a bunch of pictures here and you simply click on one of them and then you can
2:59:59
move on. Very cool.
3:00:05
See how many uses there are for image galleries. Essentially, you know, they
3:00:10
do the same thing. They present, you know, several images, but there are so many ways that you can
3:00:17
uh implement an image gallery. We have another one from this website
3:00:25
here. You simply hover on a picture and it's going to show you a bigger version of it.
3:00:34
Pretty cool. And also we have gallery on the Apple website for AirPods Max. So if
3:00:41
we scroll all the way down to the colors, you'll see that
3:00:47
when I change the color using this picker, the images also change.
3:00:55
So this is another use or another implementation
3:01:01
for an image gallery. So then uh key takeaways, an image gallery is a way of
3:01:08
displaying a collection of images while allowing users to see several images at
3:01:13
once. Image galleries are heavily used in online stores to show product
3:01:18
variations or angles. Galleries can also be linked to a slideshow that will
3:01:24
display larger versions of the images. Okay, so now that we've seen some um
3:01:31
examples of image galleries, let's see how we can implement one for our website
3:01:37
coming up. [Music] based on the wireframe. Our website also
Let’s design an image gallery
3:01:45
has an image gallery. Although ours is a bit more like a portfolio showcase, but
3:01:52
because we're only going to display images there, I think um we can uh safely categorize it as an image
3:01:58
gallery. So, uh let's get to work. This is what we have in the wireframe. We
3:02:04
have a title, small description and then a list of you know the portfolio entries
3:02:10
where we'll display a single image. Uh and these are also cut off by um a
3:02:17
testimonial although we're not going to uh deal with this right now. That's for
3:02:22
a future lesson. But uh yeah, that's that's basically it. So let's go ahead and start with this section right here.
3:02:31
First of all, it has an auto layout applied to it with 32 pixels of spacing between items. And it's aligned in the
3:02:39
middle. Uh let's also align it in the middle of the page like so. And let's
3:02:46
position it at 256 pixels
3:02:53
from the element above it. And remember 256
3:02:58
is the distance we set as default between the major sections
3:03:05
of uh of our layout. So we're going to use the same here. Now
3:03:11
let's apply some uh typography to this. Uh this uh should be an H3 based on the
3:03:19
positioning in the uh in the layout. So let's choose H3 from here.
3:03:27
But the thing is I want this to be bold. Right now the H3s that I have uh or the
3:03:33
H3 style that I set is light but I want
3:03:39
it to be bold. So I can have both a light version and a bold version. Uh to
3:03:44
do that simply you can unlink or detach the style and choose bold and then you
3:03:53
if you want you can create another style called H3 bold.
3:03:59
So now you have two options basically you can use the H3 bold or the regular
3:04:05
H3. This should be a paragraph. So let's set that. See how easy it is
3:04:12
with text styles. You don't have to worry about remembering the exact text
3:04:18
properties. You just create a font style or a text style and uh you use it when
3:04:24
you need to. Awesome. Next, let's see about these images. And I've prepared a
3:04:31
couple of images. Now, normally uh for a real project, I would use uh images from
3:04:38
like real client work, but because this is a demo project, uh I'm just going to
3:04:43
use some placeholder images uh that I got from Invato Elements. They're uh
3:04:49
like a collection from various UI kits that I found on Elements, and you can find links uh to that down below. Now,
3:04:58
what I'm going to do is simply delete these because I'm not going to use uh this exact structure.
3:05:06
So, in fact, I I might just leave one of them like so
3:05:12
because I want to use it as a background. So, let me reposition it
3:05:18
like that. And then I also want to leave a fixed amount of space between this
3:05:24
element and the title. And I'm going to use half the distance I used from here
3:05:29
to here. So 256 / 2 is 128. Also a multiple of 8, of course. So just move
3:05:37
this down. 128. Just like that.
3:05:43
Now let's see about those images. I have a couple prepared and I'm just going to copy and paste them for uh convenience.
3:05:50
Right. This is one of them. And it's actually the the exact size that we need.
3:05:57
And that size I calculated like so. Uh the first guide that we
3:06:05
created was at 64 pixels. So I'm going to add another one at 128 on both sides.
3:06:13
Okay. So basically we have 128 pixels of
3:06:18
space. now on the left and on the right and this image fits within exactly that
3:06:25
amount. Now, here's the thing. This is not like an image that you would drag
3:06:30
and drop and it would be standalone. It's actually a shape with an image
3:06:37
background. And using it like this allows me to use
3:06:44
various fill modes like fit, crop, tile and so on. I have it set to fill so I
3:06:52
can easily resize this image container basically
3:06:59
and it's only going to display parts of that image which fit in the container.
3:07:05
As you can see, the image is much bigger, but I can choose how much of it
3:07:11
I want to display. So, for height, I'm actually just going
3:07:17
to go with 800 pixels because that's divisible by 8, the 8 point system. And
3:07:24
between the image and this background, I'm also going to use 128 pixels.
3:07:31
However, I want this background to also have 128 pixel distance between this
3:07:38
edge and this edge. You know what I mean? So, I'm just going to make it
3:07:46
slightly bigger until this distance right here, this is 128
3:07:54
pixels. And I think it just creates uh a nice visual balance.
3:08:00
because I'm essentially moving this element down
3:08:08
128 pixels. And finally, I'm not going to leave that gray background. Instead,
3:08:14
what we can do is we can sample a color from the actual image like so.
3:08:22
Or maybe we want something from this side. You can press I on the keyboard to
3:08:28
sample it. It really depends on, you know, how you want to combine the colors, but I find that uh picking the
3:08:37
primary or the accent color uh from an image works really well. So, I'm going to stick with this purple.
3:08:45
Cool. So, that's the first portfolio entry. We can now um duplicate this and
3:08:52
create the other entries. Let me just move this down. So, holding down option or alt and
3:09:00
shift, I can just drag and drop to create a copy. And I want to make sure that I have 128 pixels of distance
3:09:10
between these two elements. And let's get the other
3:09:16
images. And again, just for convenience, I'm simply going to paste these in
3:09:23
like so. Same deal. These are basically shapes that have an image background set
3:09:30
to fill. And I just went ahead and arranged them
3:09:35
in um this fashion just to give them a scattered look. And now I can simply do
3:09:43
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13. That's
3:09:49
130 pixels from the edge. It's actually a bit more.
3:09:57
And then one two to create that 128 pixel gap. Make sure everything is right
3:10:04
here. 128. These are nicely aligned
3:10:10
to my guides.
3:10:15
And then finally going to take this sample color. Let's go with this uh with
3:10:21
this green like so. Or maybe this one. I think it's actually the same color. So
3:10:29
that's the second entry. And finally for the third entry, let me move this
3:10:36
content a little bit further down. Again, holding down shift and alt
3:10:45
holding down shift and command to select the items in this group. Delete those.
3:10:52
And let's paste in the final portfolio entry. Let's make sure this is sized
3:11:00
accordingly. So holding down command shift arrow up
3:11:06
we go 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110
3:11:13
120 and then I'm letting go of shift. So I go in increments of one. So we go 1 2
3:11:20
3 4 5 6 7 8 to reduce the height. So now
3:11:26
we are at 128 pixels. And finally, let's sample the color.
3:11:33
Let's go with this one. Nice. And let's not forget, we also must
3:11:41
include this testimonial part in the portfolio area, but we'll do that in um
3:11:48
in the future lesson. For now, this is our image gallery, and we chose to
3:11:54
present it like this. As usual, now it's your turn to create the image gallery
3:12:00
for the website or the portfolio section. And while it's totally okay to
3:12:06
copy exactly what I did, I encourage you to explore a different layout, maybe one
3:12:11
that uses columns or maybe you can draw some inspiration from
3:12:17
the examples I showed you previously. So, make it your own. um get inspired
3:12:24
and try and create something unique. Uh with that said, let's move on to the
3:12:30
next pattern on our list, which is the footer. [Music]
Definition and use cases for footers
3:12:37
All right, time to work with footers. But uh first of all, let's try and define them. A website's footer is an
3:12:45
area positioned at the bottom of every page in a website right below the main
3:12:51
content. Now, footers usually contain information that help with the usability
3:12:57
of the website. For example, a navigation menu placed in the footer
3:13:02
allow uh allows users to navigate the website without having to scroll all the
3:13:08
way back up. a call to action placed in the footer will u actually help a user
3:13:13
make a decision much easier because it's, you know, right there uh so he
3:13:18
doesn't have to go back up. Plus, it's a very strategic uh place to position a call to action
3:13:26
because you read a website from top to bottom. So, uh, on a landing page, for
3:13:32
example, you read from the top, you see the main message, uh, you see the benefits of using, maybe some user
3:13:39
testimonials, and once you get to the bottom, maybe you've already made up your mind and
3:13:45
you're ready to go. You see that call to action and you're more inclined to uh to
3:13:52
make a decision right then and there. And the examples can go on and on. Uh,
3:13:58
the footer is also a perfect place for content that doesn't really belong anywhere else in the page. Things like
3:14:06
copyright text, links to external resources,
3:14:12
u social media icons, right? All of these have um a really good place in the
3:14:20
footer. So, let's go ahead and see some examples. Let's start with the Adidas website. And
3:14:28
the footer here, if we scroll all the way down, contains a call to action
3:14:34
displayed in a very bright yellow. And also, it contains a site map. And a site
3:14:41
map is basically a list of your website's pages. This is really, really
3:14:46
important for SEO. And then at the very bottom, we have a location selector. We
3:14:54
have the copyright text and some links that don't really belong anywhere else
3:15:00
like cookie settings, privacy policy, terms and conditions, and so on. Let's
3:15:06
go to Groveade where uh we also have um a very simple footer. This one has a
3:15:15
scroll to top button or go up as it's called here. And then we have a navigation menu, a newsletter signup,
3:15:24
right? This is another type of call to action. And then the usual links,
3:15:30
copyright text, and social media icons.
3:15:35
Next up, let's see the Stripe website. Here we also have uh a pretty
3:15:41
interesting footer. We have the call to action. Uh some additional content that
3:15:46
sends the user to various parts of the website and then a big site map information
3:15:54
about the location and also probably a language switcher. Yep, there it is. And
3:16:01
then a very simple copyright um copyright text right here. If we go to
3:16:08
the Avocode website, uh we can also see links to very important pages in the
3:16:17
website. We can see a logo. This is also uh practiced a lot. Site map.
3:16:25
Another call to action here. Very interesting. And the usual copyright,
3:16:30
social, and uh links. And finally, let's take a look at the
3:16:35
timely websites footer. Here we also have a big call to action with, you
3:16:42
know, benefits for signing up. And then we have the company logo. Uh we have
3:16:48
some awards here next to this uh this call to action button. Uh some links for
3:16:54
downloading and then sitemap and then finally copyright, social and the usual
3:17:01
links. So, a lot of similarities between the footers of all of these websites,
3:17:07
but also some pretty big differences. All in all, this should give you a really good idea of um what a footer
3:17:14
should contain and how other designers would implement this common pattern in a
3:17:22
website. All right, now time for some key takeaways. Uh, a website's footer is
3:17:27
an area positioned at the bottom of every page on a website right below the
3:17:33
main content. Footers usually contain information that improve the usability
3:17:39
of the website. Footers also display content that doesn't belong anywhere else, like copyright text, external
3:17:46
links, and site maps. All right, so now that we know what footers are all about,
3:17:52
let's go ahead and design our own. that's coming up. [Music]
Let’s design the footer
3:17:59
All right, time to get busy again and use our massive knowledge of footers to
3:18:06
create our own. Ready? Let's go. So, let's take a look at our footer. Uh,
3:18:12
it's made up of two sections basically. So, we have the call to action
3:18:19
here and then the other one with the copyright info, some links, and the
3:18:27
social media icons. So, then let's start by deleting this line here. And I'm
3:18:34
going to change things up a little bit here uh from the original wireframe. So,
3:18:40
instead of this being a subtitle, I'm going to make it a title. And I'm going
3:18:46
to make this be a regular paragraph, like a description. So, let's uh start
3:18:51
with that. I'm going to use an H4 for this and a paragraph for this.
3:19:00
And let's not forget to make this black and this black 75. And I just remembered
3:19:09
I think I forgot to apply the proper colors here. Yeah, let's go ahead and do
3:19:14
that right now. Black 75. Perfect. And I'm going to align the contents of
3:19:23
the CTA area with the contents of the CTA area on the top. So, we're going to
3:19:30
use the outermost guide, the one at 256 pixels. So, let's
3:19:37
scroll back down. Let's do a proper alignment here. Like so.
3:19:43
And I think this text is a bit too long. So, I'm going to make it just a tiny bit
3:19:48
smaller. I'm going to use 640 pixels for width. Why 640, you might
3:19:56
ask? Well, that's divisible by 8. So, I really like that number. Uh, this one
3:20:03
also 640 pixels. And the frame they're
3:20:09
inside also has auto layout applied. 32 pixel spacing between items. That's
3:20:15
perfect. But one thing that I don't like is the way these are positioned right
3:20:22
here. I don't want them there. So instead, I'll delete them. I'll go back up to my
3:20:30
header and I'll just drag them from here because these are already styled.
3:20:35
they're already inside an auto layout frame, so I don't have to do that again. So,
3:20:43
I'm just gonna select one of the elements inside my auto layout frame and
3:20:50
I'm going to hit commandV and that's going to paste it immediately after.
3:20:56
Now, what about this? This should be a button, right? So then let's go to our
3:21:03
assets and I'll grab a button from here. I also want this to be or to use the primary
3:21:11
button style because I want it to stand out. So going back here.
3:21:18
I'm just going to paste it in. I'm going to change the text and I'm
3:21:24
going to get rid of the icon. And then I'm going to get rid of this.
3:21:31
And I'm going to select both of these. Shift A to add auto layout. And I'm
3:21:38
going to use the same distance between the button and the rest of the CTA that
3:21:45
I used uh previously on the top. And that's 96 pixels. And if you scroll back
3:21:52
up, just to show you what I mean, the distance between this button and this
3:21:58
text is also 96. It's all about consistency, right? And that translates
3:22:03
to paddings, margins, distances, and so on. So with that, the CTA section is
3:22:12
pretty much complete. Let's just bring that up a little bit. And now we can get
3:22:17
started on this section here. And actually this section is very much alike
3:22:26
or very much like our header. So to make things easier for me, copy that. I'm
3:22:32
going to paste it down here. Make sure it's properly aligned
3:22:41
like so. And now all I have to do is replace the
3:22:47
content. So for this content, I'm going to use the paragraph style with black
3:22:54
75%. And I'm going to take this command X and
3:22:59
I'm going to paste it inside my header, which will now be called footer. So
3:23:05
paste that in. And actually the frame with auto layout is this one,
3:23:12
frame 23. So, let's move it there. And that's actually going to place it
3:23:18
correctly uh within this auto layout. And then I
3:23:24
can just change its position like so. I'm also going to delete this logo. The
3:23:30
two links will be privacy policy and
3:23:35
terms and conditions. Uh, we don't actually need these two
3:23:42
separators here. So, we'll delete that. And what else? Let's see. Delete these.
3:23:50
Uh, delete this one. Instead, we'll place
3:23:55
that line on the top of the element like so.
3:24:01
And I think actually for this piece of text, I'm not going to use the paragraph
3:24:06
style. I'm going to use a smaller font size like 15 like the one I used here.
3:24:13
So we'll go 15 24 regular color black
3:24:18
75. Let's make sure these have the proper color as well. Let's delete this.
3:24:27
And now what I'm going to do is position this
3:24:32
a little bit further up so that we have the proper spacing of 256
3:24:40
pixels. And while doing that I actually realized
3:24:46
that I have a typo here in the header. It says about me link
3:24:54
instead of about me. So, let's fix that. And
3:24:59
that's pretty much done. This is now our footer. We have the CTA
3:25:06
and we have this section that has the copyright, the external links and the
3:25:15
social media icons. So, as you can see, we made some slight changes compared to
3:25:21
uh the original wireframe which uh had, you know, the contact info
3:25:26
here. Uh this was more of a subtitle instead of a title. But as I said, a
3:25:33
wireframe is not final. It doesn't dictate how elements are displayed or
3:25:39
laid out in a page. A wireframe simply provides you with the content. And then
3:25:44
as a UI designer, it's your job to take that content and dress it up and make it
3:25:49
look nice. So, we went from this to this.
3:25:57
Let me actually zoom in here a little bit so you can see it better. Cool.
3:26:03
And that's how you can design a footer or one of the ways you can design a footer. And of course, now it's your
3:26:09
task to design the footer for your version of the website. So, make it
3:26:15
exactly like mine or do your own thing. It doesn't really matter as long as you
3:26:20
practice, practice, practice. So, um let's move on now to the next pattern on
3:26:29
our list, which is testimonials. And with that, we'll actually wrap up the
3:26:34
homepage that's coming up.
Definition and use cases for testimonials
3:26:40
All right, testimonials. What are they? Well, basically they're nice things or
3:26:47
hopefully nice things that your customers have to say about you, you, the business, the brand. And you would
3:26:54
use testimonials to establish credibility. So, when someone sees that
3:27:01
um other people are saying good things about you, uh they're much more likely
3:27:06
to to become a client because you established credibility with them. Now, before we look at some examples, I want
3:27:13
to give you probably the most important piece of advice, and that is to not use
3:27:21
fake testimonials ever. Um, it doesn't even matter if you're
3:27:30
just getting started and you don't have clients. Don't use fake testimonials. No
3:27:35
testimonials is much better than fake testimonials. So, if you're a new
3:27:41
business, wait until you get some real feedback from your clients and then publish those testimonials. Trust me,
3:27:48
you'll thank me later. Oh, and if you're wondering why you shouldn't use fake
3:27:53
testimonials, well, first of all, it's unethical. It's manipulative, and um
3:28:00
second of all, it's also illegal. So, there you go. Now, let's see some
3:28:06
examples. The first uh example comes from the Asana website, which is a
3:28:12
project management tool. So, if we scroll down, and I mean all the way
3:28:18
down, we can find a nice section for testimonials. And as you can see, they have a video testimonial here from
3:28:25
Ashley George. We have the actual quote here, uh, the logo of the client's
3:28:32
company, and also here we can see the testimonial author and its position,
3:28:39
right? And then you can use this to view the rest of the testimonials, which is
3:28:45
pretty cool. It's like a slider. Very nice. See how they're using real
3:28:53
people, real testimonials? That's exactly what you should do as well. Uh
3:28:59
let's go to ConvertKit, which is uh another great website, and we can find
3:29:06
their testimonials. Here we have pictures of the testimonial author. Uh
3:29:12
some other pictures for context, you know, the testimonial itself. And here
3:29:18
we can, you know, cycle between the different testimonials. Very nicely done. So here they don't
3:29:26
have a slider like a sauna, but they have kind of a tabbed interface
3:29:33
that you can use to cycle between these. Pretty cool. Uh, next we are seeing the
3:29:40
website of your next agency. And if we scroll down, we can find the section for
3:29:47
testimonials right here. And this is yet another type of slider. You can use
3:29:54
these controls. You can just click on them. You can, you know, use the heart bullet points here
3:30:01
to switch between them. And again, picture, name, position, and the
3:30:08
testimonial itself. Uh, next one is from Lus Ludus.
3:30:15
And their testimonials look something like this. And instead of displaying
3:30:21
like what you've been seeing so far, they actually display tweets about this
3:30:28
product or service. And finally, let's look at the Invision app website.
3:30:36
And um this presents testimonials a little bit differently. They're using a
3:30:42
much more minimalistic approach. They just have uh one area here uh between
3:30:49
the product features and they just display the quote, the author, uh the
3:30:57
logo that's associated with the author and a picture. Very simple. No slider,
3:31:04
no nothing. So, if you just want to display one great testimonial, you can
3:31:09
do that. Absolutely no problem. If you want to display multiple testimonials,
3:31:14
you can also do that. No problem. It really depends on the uh the layout
3:31:21
of your website. So, now let's take a look at some key takeaways. Testimonials
3:31:26
are what clients have to say about your business. Use testimonials to build credibility with your audience. Never
3:31:34
ever use fake testimonials. It's unethical and illegal. All right. So now
3:31:40
that we saw some realworld implementations for testimonials, let's go ahead and create our own that's
Let’s design some testimonials
3:31:48
coming up. [Music] All right. So our website has two places
3:31:55
for the testimonials, the homepage and the about page. And we'll use a slightly
3:32:01
different style uh between these two pages. Let's begin. We'll start with the
3:32:06
homepage where we have this one. This is actually the very last uh element that
3:32:13
we need to style. So let's start with the text first. Uh I'm going to use the
3:32:19
uh proper color here. I'll use black. And for the text properties, I'm going
3:32:25
to be using the H4 style. But in this particular instance, I want it to be uh
3:32:31
light instead of um bold for the font weight. So, I'm going to detach uh the
3:32:39
style. And I'm just going to change from bold to light. And if we want, we can
3:32:46
create another text style. We're going to call it H4 light. Cool. Next, let's
3:32:52
see about this text. We're going to use uh black.
3:32:57
And actually, I want to use a different style for the second piece of text.
3:33:06
And we'll be using black 75. As for the text uh style, let's go.
3:33:16
Uh let's see what styles we have selected here. We have saved here. we
3:33:21
don't have any that would match what we need. Uh the thing is I want it to be a
3:33:27
bit uh smaller than a uh a typical paragraph. So we're going to use the
3:33:32
same style that um we used for uh some of these links here in the footer, which
3:33:38
is bold uh 15 font size and 24 line height. So let's
3:33:46
do that. So proximova bold 15 24 and this will keep it uh regular
3:33:56
15 24. Let's uh group these two into an
3:34:02
auto layout frame. And I'm going to use 32 pixels spacing between items. And I'm
3:34:08
going to align them in the center like so. And actually 32 pixels is way too
3:34:14
much. Let's go with like eight. Or maybe actually let's do no spacing
3:34:21
because they have their own line heights. And I think this would actually work out pretty well. I'm actually going
3:34:28
to keep the exact same uh style for the avatar and the company logo here. I
3:34:34
think they look really good. Uh but I'm just going to change the fill here to maybe a black 10. And this is actually
3:34:42
supposed to overlay, but because we have a transparency,
3:34:47
we don't get that cut off effect here. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to sample the exact color. And I'm going to
3:34:54
use that one instead. 100% opacity. Just like that. Making sure the logo has the
3:35:02
proper black color. And let's see, the
3:35:07
distance here is 32 pixels. That's spoton. And the distance here between
3:35:13
the text and the other elements is 64 pixels. And that should work out just
3:35:21
fine. And then finally, uh I think I'm going to make this just a little bit bigger. Something like 800 pixels. And
3:35:29
then take this, align it in in the middle. And I'm actually going to move this up
3:35:36
between the second and the third uh portfolio entry. Uh making sure of
3:35:43
course the dimensions or the margins here are uh exactly the same. So 128.
3:35:51
So let's move this down. Let's bring this up. Oops, I didn't click it.
3:35:59
Making sure that it's 128 from
3:36:06
that uh portfolio entry. Bring this up until it matches. And we're done. That's
3:36:13
the first style for our testimonial. Now, I'm going to copy this
3:36:21
and I'm going to move on to the about page. And we're still using the wireframe
3:36:28
here. And what I can do is I can delete this bit. I can paste in
3:36:35
my testimonial. And we also need to make this bigger
3:36:42
1,800 pixels. Don't worry about the rest of the elements. Uh some of them will be
3:36:48
designing in this course while uh others will be uh up to you to uh to design for
3:36:55
your assignment. But you know, I'll also provide the finished design so you can
3:37:00
uh you can see exactly what I did. So for this uh particular style, I want to
3:37:07
make this text a little bit smaller. So we'll go with probably an H5
3:37:13
like so. And I'm going to take the entire frame.
3:37:21
I'm going to give it a fill color of white. And before we do anything else,
3:37:26
let's get rid of this bit. We don't need it. Uh I want to add like a solid uh
3:37:34
faded background behind these so that the containers
3:37:40
that have the testimonials look like cards. Okay. So let's grab the rectangle
3:37:47
tool. Draw a rectangle. Something like that. I'm going to use command
3:37:54
and um left square bracket to bring it
3:38:00
or to send it to the back of this element. You can also rightclick
3:38:06
and you can say bring to front, send to back. Uh, so you know, bringing to the
3:38:13
front, sending to the back just alters the order
3:38:18
of the layers here in Figma. So if you want an element to be on top of another,
3:38:23
you just change its order. Okay. And for the fill color, let's go with black 10.
3:38:32
That should work out pretty well. Maybe black five.
3:38:37
That's a bit It's a bit too low in terms of transparency. So, let's go with black 10.
3:38:43
Okay. So, I'm going to just do this and I'm going to give it the proper width.
3:38:50
And then I'm going to add some padding to this element. So, I'm going to go here under auto layout, and I'm going to
3:38:57
say 128 top, 64 right, 128 again on the bottom,
3:39:04
and again 64 for the left. Let's also give this uh a nice
3:39:12
border radius, maybe like 8 pixels. And then let's um give it a drop shadow. Now
3:39:19
for the drop shadow, you can use a similar process like we did on the buttons. We used the smooth shadow um
3:39:28
plugin and this creates layered shadows which look much much better than a
3:39:34
single shadow or you can do a single shadow. It really depends on how you want it to look. Uh for me personally, I
3:39:41
like the appearance of uh this one. I'm not going to tamper with this. I'm just going to apply the shadow uh directly.
3:39:48
Now, we actually need to fit uh two of these
3:39:53
in this page. So, we need to make the text here a little bit smaller. I'm thinking something around
3:40:00
640 pixels, something like that. And we also need to uh position it correctly
3:40:08
from the edges. So, for that, shift R to bring up the rulers. And we're going to
3:40:14
create some guides. So the first one is going to be at 128 pixels
3:40:22
and the other one is going to be at 1672.
3:40:27
And I just use the homepage uh as um as a reference. So 1672 just
3:40:34
like that. And we can actually work out exactly how wide these elements can be.
3:40:43
Uh let's move this out of the way for now and let's do a simple calculation right.
3:40:51
So first of all let's figure out how wide this container needs to be and for
3:40:57
that we can do a simple calculation. We can say the following. Our page here
3:41:04
is 1,800 pixels. From that we subtract 128 pixels from each side. So that's
3:41:11
256. And we also subtract the gap that we
3:41:17
want between the two testimonials. Let's say 96 pixels. And that gives us 1448.
3:41:25
So 1448 / 2 gives us 724
3:41:31
pixels. So we're actually very close. Right now this element is 726
3:41:38
pixels. That means we just need to um resize this to 596.
3:41:47
And now we have the correct width for our element. So now we can duplicate it.
3:41:53
We can position it, align it with the guides like so.
3:42:05
And now we should have exactly 96 pixels in between.
3:42:10
Let's um change the text here. I'm just going to copy and paste.
3:42:18
And let's also change the author
3:42:24
like so. And we also need to change
3:42:29
these two elements. So I'm just going to copy those. I'm going to paste them in,
3:42:35
remove the old one, and make sure the fill here is set to the correct color,
3:42:42
black, or sorry, we actually need to
3:42:47
to get a a solid color from here. And the logo should be set to black,
3:42:56
like so. And finally, let's go ahead and group these two. Command G. And
3:43:04
I want to position these in such a way that they have 128 pixels on the top as
3:43:10
padding. And let's resize this bit.
3:43:17
Let's move this down. And I'm going to resize this bit
3:43:23
like so.
3:43:29
so that we have 128 pixels on the bottom as well. Shift R to hide the rulers and
3:43:37
the guides. And there you have it. This is the second
3:43:43
testimonial section. And with that, we've covered one more pattern, the
3:43:48
testimonials. And uh now, of course, it's your turn to design the testimonials for your version of the
3:43:55
website. And as always, I encourage you to explore different layouts from um or
3:44:02
compare to what I'm doing in uh in my version of the website. Uh once you do
3:44:07
that, you'll be ready to move on to the next uh pattern, which is tabs. More
3:44:14
about that coming up. [Music]
Definition and use cases for tabs
3:44:19
All right, let's talk about tabs. And I'm sure most of you know by now what a tab control is. But uh just in case you
3:44:26
don't, uh let's uh take a look at a quick definition. A tab control is a UI
3:44:32
element where content is separated into different panels with only one panel
3:44:37
visible at a time. The hidden panels can then be accessed through user
3:44:43
interaction. Tabs are used for displaying large amounts of content in a relatively small area. And while they
3:44:51
can be styled in a variety of ways, the basic operating principle remains the
3:44:57
same. So, uh let's have a look at some examples. First one is from Avaode. And
3:45:04
if we scroll down to the testimonial section, uh we can see tabs being used
3:45:10
here instead of a traditional slider. So you basically click
3:45:17
on a tab link to change the content of the tab control. Basically pretty cool
3:45:24
implementation. Uh moving on to timely. Uh here we have some tabs
3:45:31
uh right here also for testimonials right and clicking these will basically
3:45:37
change this area right here.
3:45:46
Next let's go to Omnitype. And if we scroll down, this is an
3:45:52
e-commerce website by the way, and we can change
3:45:58
this area right here, we can view information like specifications, shipping info, reviews, where to buy,
3:46:05
and so on. This is actually used a lot in uh certain themes for e-commerce
3:46:12
where these informations are presented under various tab
3:46:17
controls. Uh next let's go to drop and they also
3:46:23
use tabs to separate the various types of content for each product like so.
3:46:32
Then we have a nice website here Canal Street Market
3:46:38
and they are using tabs as navigation basically. So if you want to see the
3:46:44
various uh sections of the website, you would use this kind of tabbed control
3:46:52
which is pretty cool use. And then you can go back to the homepage.
3:46:58
And then finally we have the imagineers website which also uses
3:47:06
tabs for navigation. So, as you can see, there are a bunch of
3:47:11
uses for tabs. They're not just for um divining
3:47:17
blocks of content in uh in the main areas of the website, but you can also
3:47:23
use them for the entire website content as navigation. You can also use them for
3:47:29
testimonials like we've seen in these two examples.
3:47:36
So tab controls are pretty versatile. Now for some key takeaways. A tab
3:47:44
control is a UI element where content is separated into different panels with
3:47:50
only one panel visible at a time. Tabs are used for displaying large amounts of
3:47:56
content in a relatively small area. While tabs can be styled differently,
3:48:01
the operating principle is the same. Okay, so now it's time to design some
3:48:07
tabs for our project. See you in a bit.
Let’s design some tabs
3:48:14
Based on the wireframes, the tab control that we need to design is in the about page and its purpose is to present the
3:48:22
tools that Robert Fox is using for both design and development. So let's get
3:48:28
started. We are back in Figma. So let's go ahead and zoom in here.
3:48:34
I'm just going to move these out of the way and I'm going to focus solely on the
3:48:39
tab controls. So the idea here is pretty simple. We have two tab uh links uh that say tools
3:48:47
I use for design, tools I use for development. And whenever we click on one of these uh this content here will
3:48:55
change. And to represent this type of content
3:49:00
which is basically a list we can do a lot of things. Uh we can use a simple like text list but that would be too
3:49:08
boring and uninteresting. So instead uh I'm
3:49:13
thinking we'll use we'll keep the same um principle that we have here. So boxes
3:49:20
or cards or whatever you want to call them. But I also want to add some imagery. Uh, and I'm thinking the logos
3:49:28
of the actual tools. So, the Sketch logo, Figma, Adobe XD logo, and so on
3:49:35
and so forth. But first of all, let's start with the tab links. And I'm
3:49:40
thinking of using a similar design that I use for the buttons. So, something
3:49:47
rounded like this, like a pill shape, but without the shadow. uh the button or
3:49:55
the text should keep the exact same style, but in terms of color, they'll be much
3:50:03
more muted. So, I'm thinking, you know, just so I'm thinking two shades of the
3:50:09
black color that we're using to represent the active tab and the inactive tab.
3:50:16
So, let's go ahead and do that. Uh let's see. We are using 24 pixel and 48 pixel
3:50:23
for padding. So let's keep that in mind. And let's go back to our design. Let's
3:50:30
see. Do we have an auto layout frame? We do. So let's remove the distance here
3:50:38
between items. Let's set 24
3:50:44
48 for the padding.
3:50:49
like so. Make sure the uh item distribution is
3:50:56
set to packed. And also this shouldn't be a fixed width.
3:51:03
Just set hug contents here. And that means the uh the parent frame will just
3:51:09
resize to fit whatever text I have inside here. So now if I change the text
3:51:14
for example, you see the the parent element just
3:51:21
resizes along with it, which is exactly what we want. Then I'm going to remove
3:51:27
the stroke. And for fill, I'm going to use black. Let's also give this like a
3:51:35
100 border radius to make it round. the text inside.
3:51:41
Let's select both of these. That's going to be Proximanova bold 15 font size 24
3:51:48
line height. And let's make this white.
3:51:54
And let's make this black 50. And actually, you know what?
3:52:00
Let's uh remove this one. And let's duplicate this frame
3:52:07
because it's much easier like that. And now all I have to do is change the text
3:52:14
black 50 and the uh background color to black 10. Just like that. Now let's
3:52:23
select the parent container for these two elements. And this has auto layout
3:52:29
applied. That's good. But I also want to give this a fill color. So, let's go with black 10. Let's also
3:52:36
make this round. Let's give it an 8 pixel padding. And
3:52:42
let's remove that spacing between items like so.
3:52:47
So, then I can go to this element and I'm going to remove the background.
3:52:55
Okay. So, now it looks like we have an active tab. And then when this is
3:53:00
clicked, they're going to swap styles, right? This will have the dark background. This will have no
3:53:06
background. Does that make sense? So, those are the tab links. Now, let's focus on the tab
3:53:16
content here. And I'm going to start with uh with this one with sketch. Uh
3:53:21
let me bring in a sketch logo. And this is pretty easy to come by. just uh search uh Google for you know sketch
3:53:29
logo SVG or vector and then I'm going to select the parent
3:53:34
frame which has auto layout applied and I'm going to switch it direction from
3:53:40
horizontal to vertical. I'm going to set a spacing between items at 16 32 for
3:53:48
padding. I'm going to move the text below the image. I'm also going to make
3:53:54
sure that all the items inside are centered like so. And then the text
3:54:01
should use the H6 style just like that. And then the background should be black
3:54:10
10 so that it matches what we have here. And I can also round off the corners by
3:54:17
using 8 pixel as a border radius. Now for the rest, it's really simple. I can
3:54:23
actually select all of them. Apply
3:54:29
the correct fill. Apply the correct border radius.
3:54:35
1632. Make sure everything is aligned in the middle.
3:54:42
Then I can select the texts, the text elements,
3:54:48
and I can make sure they all use the H6 style we defined. And then we can simply
3:54:55
uh copy and paste the rest of the logos. So here is the one for Figma.
3:55:02
And also, yes, I forgot to change the auto layout direction from horizontal to
3:55:08
vertical. like so. Here is the Adobe XD one. And
3:55:19
oh, let's also change this back to where
3:55:24
it's supposed to be. Uh, we actually did this once, but we had the direction set
3:55:29
to horizontal, but then when we switched it to vertical, it was still aligning
3:55:35
everything in the middle, but it was doing that based on the original direction. So now that uh we changed the
3:55:41
direction to vertical, we need to also reapply uh the alignment here. Let's
3:55:46
grab the Photoshop logo like so. And by the way, all of these are 48x 48. Again,
3:55:53
multiple of 8. And finally, the one for Illustrator. Cool. Now,
3:56:01
you can see these are not sized equally, and I don't want that. I want every
3:56:07
single one of these cards to have equal size regardless of the content inside.
3:56:14
So, how do we do that? Well, it's actually pretty simple. I have a frame with auto layout,
3:56:21
correct? Well, I can resize this the parent frame
3:56:29
so that it's full width, but also it has the correct spacing
3:56:38
from the edges like so. So, 128 128. We can even bring in the guides and resize
3:56:45
it like that. So with that done, we can select each one of these elements and
3:56:54
under resizing instead of hug contents, which will resize it to fit the exact
3:57:01
contents of each element, we're going to set it to fill container. And fill container basically tells each box to be
3:57:09
as wide as the container as the parent container, which in our case is
3:57:14
1544 pixels. But because we have several items, that
3:57:21
distance is divided between each one and each gets
3:57:27
a fixed equal width of 296 pixels.
3:57:33
You'll see that when we resize the parent container,
3:57:39
these elements are resizing along with it, which is really cool. This is such a
3:57:45
cool functionality in Figma and it actually gets us really close to
3:57:53
realworld behavior. So when you're uh developing this website and you're
3:57:58
writing the CSS for it, you can use something called flexbox which behaves in exactly the same way.
3:58:07
And then finally, let's um grab this and position it at
3:58:12
I would say 96 pixels from the tab control. And 96 pixels is a measurement
3:58:20
that we've used in other places. For example,
3:58:26
here, right? The distance between this button
3:58:32
and the text is 96 pixels.
3:58:38
So, we're using it the same here, but obviously uh you know, you can position it in any way that you see fit. If this
3:58:46
looks better to you, then go ahead uh use this measurement. But since we're using the 8 point system, make sure the
3:58:54
distance you're using is a multiple of eight. Uh in my case, I think 96 uh
3:59:00
pixels actually looks just fine for this application. So I'm going to stick with
3:59:05
it. So there you have it. That is our finished tab control. And if you want to
3:59:13
design the other part, the development, well, all you have to do is move the
3:59:19
active state to this link and just change the content here to whatever you
3:59:27
want. Right? Then the tab control is done. We've crossed it off our list and
3:59:34
now we can move on. As usual, now it's your turn to design the tab control. And
3:59:40
once you do that, we are ready to move on to the next pattern, which is the
3:59:45
accordion. So that's coming up. [Music]
Definition and use cases for accordions
3:59:51
Okay, let's talk about accordians. Uh these are box shaped musical instruments
3:59:56
of the bellows driven free read a phone
4:00:02
type. Hold on. I think I searched the wrong Wikipedia page here.
4:00:11
How about we try that again? H. Okay, let's talk about accordians. Now
4:00:18
in UI design uh these are very similar to tab controls in the sense that uh the
4:00:25
content is split up in multiple panels which can be opened by the user.
4:00:31
However, unlike tabs, accordians can display multiple panels at once and
4:00:36
they're used for simpler content like text. This is a very popular uh UI
4:00:43
pattern for an FAQ section that stands for frequently asked questions. Uh so
4:00:49
let me show you some examples. We are on Tesco's website. Uh we're looking at the
4:00:55
frequently asked questions uh section and here they have a very simple design
4:01:01
with an accordion that allows us to open multiple panels
4:01:06
at once. And uh this accordion is also nested, right? So we have an accordion
4:01:12
within an accordion. The next example is from Heineken. And let me actually
4:01:20
confirm my age here. So on their FAQ page, they can also or
4:01:27
they also display an accordion
4:01:32
which looks like this. Uh the difference here is that they uh kind of organize
4:01:39
uh their questions into various categories,
4:01:46
but at the end of the day, it's still an accordion.
4:01:53
Next, uh we have uh the website from material kitchen. And again, this uses
4:02:01
a slightly different approach. in the sense that we can only display
4:02:07
one accordium panel at a time and this is not animated. So, it's kind of
4:02:13
choppy, but it's an accordion nonetheless.
4:02:22
Next, uh we have the urban jungle beauty website
4:02:28
which again uses some nice animated accordians uh to display frequent
4:02:34
questions and answers. And again, this uh has the accordion items kind of
4:02:41
organized into various categories. And finally, we have another FAQ page. Uh but this
4:02:49
time the layout is very different from what we've seen so far. The
4:02:55
functionality is of course the same but the questions themselves are like
4:03:02
display in in this big section here and we have one for each question.
4:03:12
Very interesting.
4:03:18
But in the end, yes, it is an accordion.
4:03:24
Pretty cool. So now, let's take a look at some key takeaways. Accordians are
4:03:30
similar to tabs in the sense that content is split up in multiple panels
4:03:35
which can be opened by the user. However, unlike tabs, accordians can
4:03:40
display multiple panels at once, and they're used for simpler content like
4:03:46
text. Accordians are used heavily in FAQ pages or frequently asked questions.
4:03:53
Okay, so now that we saw what an accordion is and we also saw how other
4:03:58
people are designing accordians, let's have a go at it. that's coming up.
Let's design an accordion
4:04:04
[Music] Based on the wireframes, our accordion
4:04:09
is for a Q&A section inside the contact page. So, uh, let's get to it. So, I
4:04:18
brought in the wireframe into my, uh, design page, and I'm just going to zoom
4:04:24
in here. Uh, because this section
4:04:29
is in between these two and it's kind of in the middle of the
4:04:34
page. I think uh a darker background uh would work just like we did here for
4:04:40
the testimonials. So, I'm going to copy that and I'm going to paste it in here
4:04:48
like so. Making sure it's in the correct uh frame. And because we are using the
4:04:57
uh darker background approach, we don't actually need these uh separators. Let's
4:05:03
move that to the uh to the back. And then we'll start as usual with the uh
4:05:09
typography. Let's move this. Let's align it with the 256
4:05:15
guide. And for the title here, let's uh set the color to black. And for
4:05:22
the text, let's use an H3 like this. Let's make it a little bit bigger.
4:05:27
Something like 640 pixels. And then let's start with each individual item in
4:05:35
this list. In the wireframe, I just used a plus sign here, but we're going to
4:05:40
delete that. We're going to use an uh an icon for a plus, or we can use an arrow
4:05:46
down. It really depends on how we want it to look. But I think I'll use the uh you know the plus.
4:05:53
I think it looks good. So first let's see about the typography. I'm going to be using Prox Manova bold. Uh 21
4:06:04
for font size, 30 for um line height. I
4:06:09
want to make it uh the same size as a regular paragraph basically. Uh, but for
4:06:14
the color, because this is not the active item, I'm going to make it black 50, I
4:06:20
think, would work. Well, let's actually check
4:06:27
the contrast. So, I'm going to use the background as this gray and this one as
4:06:34
the text. And we do get a good contrast. So, that what that's what we'll use.
4:06:41
Next, let's see about that icon. And to draw it, it's actually very simple.
4:06:47
Let's grab the line tool and let's draw a line that's about 12 pixels
4:06:54
in width. And let's make the stroke 3 pixels. And
4:07:00
for the color, I'm going to be using secondary. Okay. So now we can just duplicate this.
4:07:06
Command D. And then holding down shift, we'll rotate it.
4:07:11
And actually we'll make it uh 13 pixels
4:07:17
just so we we can properly align these two. Something like this. And then we
4:07:23
can just group it up. And that's going to be our plus sign. Now let's take this
4:07:29
and I'm going to paste it here inside this this frame which has by the way uh
4:07:35
auto layout applied as you can see here. But I'm going to take this and the text.
4:07:43
Shift A to create my own auto layout.
4:07:48
And I'm going to make it horizontal. I'm going to align everything in the middle like so.
4:07:55
The text should actually be to the right of the plus sign. And then I'll use 16
4:08:03
pixels as a distance between the icon and the text. Okay. And let's also make
4:08:11
this parent element 640 pixels. And I'll have each question or each question
4:08:18
frame set to fill container so that it matches the width of the parent.
4:08:25
Next up, uh let's create a separating line.
4:08:33
And let's set this to fill container. And I'm going to set the stroke to black.
4:08:38
25, maybe black 10. No, black 25 should uh
4:08:43
should work just fine. And then select the parent frame
4:08:49
and set the uh distance between items to 32. Just like that.
4:08:57
Now it's simply a matter of duplicating this element for the rest of the
4:09:03
questions and also setting the proper style for uh the answer. So let's go
4:09:10
ahead and do that. We need 1 2 3
4:09:15
four more items. So let's duplicate that along with the separator. So that's one,
4:09:23
two, three, four. And then we can grab each separator and
4:09:30
just move it whenever wherever we need.
4:09:38
Like so. And let's make some more room here for
4:09:44
for our content. Let's move this down
4:09:50
like so. Maybe make this a little bit bigger. We'll resize it um
4:09:58
later on. Now, it's simply a matter of
4:10:03
putting the right questions in. And let's go ahead and delete this, this,
4:10:11
and this. And then for the answer or the expanded version of the accordion,
4:10:19
here's what we'll do. We'll grab this that says I do not charge by the hour.
4:10:25
And I'm actually going to place it inside my parent element. Let's go ahead
4:10:31
and move that up to right here. And then I'll grab these two. Shift A to add
4:10:39
another auto layout frame. I'm going to set the distance to 16
4:10:45
pixels. I'm going to set the text style to paragraph for this one. I'm going to
4:10:51
make sure that this is set to fill container.
4:10:57
I also need to offset the distance here. Right? So, the
4:11:03
distance from this text to the edge is what? 29 pixels. So let's do that.
4:11:13
Let's add a auto layout to it as well.
4:11:18
Set this value to zero. And then the left padding, set it to 29. Like so. The
4:11:25
rest can be set to zero. And finally, grab this because it's the
4:11:33
active link. Set it to black. and also make a quick change to the
4:11:40
icon. Let's turn it into a minus instead of a plus. And if you feel that
4:11:47
this isn't aligned properly, well, you can't really move it down because it's
4:11:53
using the parent element is using auto layout, so it doesn't work.
4:11:58
But you can apply auto layout to it. In fact,
4:12:05
we already have a group set up for it. So, let's apply auto layout. And we can
4:12:11
apply a margin or sorry, a padding manually. Let's say 3 pixels. And that's
4:12:17
going to push it down slightly. And by doing that, we created the
4:12:24
expanded version. And let's actually set this to fill. And also its parent
4:12:30
element. We're going to set it to fill. And finally, let's uh get this whole
4:12:36
thing, move it up so that we have the proper padding
4:12:46
like so. And then
4:12:52
let's hide the rulers. And that is our accordion which we used
4:12:58
to create a frequently asked questions section in our design. Okay. So my
4:13:05
version of the accordion is done. Now it's your turn. Once you finish that and you're happy with the result, we can
4:13:12
move on to the final pattern on our list and that is the contact form. Coming up.
Definition and use cases for contact forms
4:13:22
I'm sure we don't really need a definition for this pattern, right? It's pretty self-explanatory. A contact form
4:13:29
is a web form that people use to contact you. Uh now, my only advice here would
4:13:34
be to keep it simple. You need to make it as easy as possible for people to get
4:13:40
in touch with you to send you a message. Therefore, keep your contact form
4:13:45
simple. In the end, you don't really need to know the shoe size of the person
4:13:51
who's contacted you, right? Or what they had for breakfast. All you need is their
4:13:56
name, email address, and their message. That's the bare minimum.
4:14:01
Um, so let's have a look now at a few real world examples of contact forms and
4:14:08
see how other people are designing them. Let's look at the Avocode website. uh
4:14:15
they're using a pretty simple form. So they they ask for name, email, phone
4:14:21
number, and message, but also a few additional fields that they consider to
4:14:26
be required like what's the company name and what's the company size and also the
4:14:33
purpose of the inquiry. Uh this is okay
4:14:38
when you're you know you're a big organization you have maybe multiple uh
4:14:44
support channels. So for example selecting the purpose of your inquiry will uh direct that message to the
4:14:51
proper team. Let's look at another example from u made by Chroma. And we
4:14:58
have a a contact form here that's uh to be honest a little bit too large in my
4:15:04
opinion. a lot of fields. They're asking for name, email, business name, uh
4:15:11
website, what services you're interested in, and the budget, and how long you've
4:15:17
been in business, some business backgrounds, additional details, how did you hear about us. And
4:15:24
granted, uh these two fields are not uh mandatory, so you can skip them. But
4:15:30
even so, it feels maybe a little bit too stuffy for a for a contact form. Uh
4:15:37
let's go to sketch.com. Uh they have um a much simpler contact
4:15:43
form. So email, they're not even asking for a name. Uh which topic
4:15:49
or what's the purpose of the um of the contact email, subject, and full
4:15:55
description. And that's it. Next, uh we have uh a contact form from uh Gradienta
4:16:03
or Gradienta. Um very simple name, email, message,
4:16:10
send, and that's it. And finally, let's take a look at monday.com. Uh they also have a relatively simple
4:16:17
contact form. first and last name, email,
4:16:23
phone, company name on company size, and of course the message. So that's it in
4:16:29
terms of structure. Also, I want you to pay attention to how these fields are
4:16:35
laid out, right? So in a typical form, you would find everything kind of in one
4:16:41
column like chroma is doing here. Uh sketch is also doing that. Gradient is
4:16:48
also doing that. But you also have cases where you can display form fields side
4:16:55
by side like this. And also notice the label of each field
4:17:02
is positioned on top of the field on top of the input. That's also a
4:17:08
detail that you need to pay attention to. And also on Monday they they're
4:17:13
using a similar layout. They have two columns here, a full column here just in
4:17:21
case the phone number is larger and then two columns again. One column
4:17:26
for the message. Also notice the uh the position of
4:17:32
the label above the field. And of course, the examples can go on and on. Pretty much
4:17:38
every website nowadays has a contact form. So, if you want more examples,
4:17:43
just uh check out your favorite websites. Uh but for now, with these
4:17:49
examples all taken care of, let's take a look at some key takeaways. Keep your
4:17:55
contact form simple so that your potential clients can easily get in touch. As a minimum, a contact form
4:18:03
should require a name, an email address, and the message. Okay. So, now that
4:18:08
we've seen what's out there and how other people are designing their contact forms, uh let's take care of our own
4:18:16
that's coming up. [Music] Okay. So, based on the wireframe, the
Let’s design a contact form
4:18:22
contact form is placed in the contact page. Imagine that. So, uh let's get
4:18:29
started. So, let's uh zoom in to our contact page. And this is the wireframe,
4:18:37
of course. So, now it's our job to take this raw
4:18:42
form and polish it, give it a good coat of paint, and make it look awesome. So,
4:18:49
then let's start by actually ungrouping it. Uh I'm thinking because I have this
4:18:56
horizontal space available to me on the larger versions or on the versions for
4:19:02
larger screens, I'm going to have a side byside uh layout. So text on this side, form on
4:19:10
that side. And also having all this text in like a big heading
4:19:18
seems a bit excessive. So instead, I'll split it up
4:19:23
in two. And I'm going to have this as a paragraph.
4:19:30
And I'm going to have this as maybe an H3 like this. And maybe we'll use the bold
4:19:37
version. Do we have a bold version? H3 bold. We do. So let's use that. So
4:19:44
now this as for color should be black 75. This should be black. Let's shift A
4:19:54
to add an auto layout. Set the distance between them to 32. And I think that's
4:20:01
going to be just fine. So now let's turn our attention to the contact form. I
4:20:08
think I'm going to make both of these sections uh equal in size and have a a nice
4:20:14
generous gap between them. Right. So let's see
4:20:20
uh we can make actually a simple calculation here. This is the amount of available space
4:20:28
we have. Let's say I want to subtract 128 pixels as the gap between. So the
4:20:35
size would be 1544 minus 128.
4:20:42
And then we'll divide this by two and that gives us 708 pixels. And so
4:20:47
actually keep that because I want to get a guide in here
4:20:54
just like this. So now you know I can make this
4:21:01
708 pixels and now my form will span from here
4:21:11
to here basically. So then let's take every single one of
4:21:17
these fields and we'll have it fill the container
4:21:25
and let's get to styling these fields. First of all, let's uh set their
4:21:33
background color to black 10.
4:21:39
Let's make rounded corners using 8 pixels as value. And for padding, let's
4:21:48
use 24 pixels on all of them.
4:21:56
Like that. Let's target the text inside. I'm going to be using Proximanova
4:22:04
regular. And you know what? Actually, I'm going to use the same style as the paragraph,
4:22:10
but for color, I'm going to use black. Okay. So, this should be the uh the
4:22:17
style of the text that's inside the input. Uh now, we need to add the
4:22:23
labels, right? So, for that, let's uh actually copy
4:22:31
a piece of text from here. Let's move it up. And let's call this
4:22:39
your name. It's also going to be 2130 for font size and line height, but I'm
4:22:46
going to switch to bold. And then I'm going to group up these two elements.
4:22:52
And I'm going to set a distance between them of 8 pixels. And let's move on. Duplicate this. This
4:23:00
is for email. This is for project details, budget range, and timeline.
4:23:09
So, let's change the text here like so. And then finally, we need to do the
4:23:14
same. Shift A, change the distance to 8 pixels between the input
4:23:21
and the um label. Shift A, eight. And
4:23:28
finally, we have these two. Shift a eight pixels. There we're almost done.
4:23:36
But the one thing that I don't like is that this form is pretty tall, right?
4:23:41
And we have certain fields like name and email address that don't need to be this long. Budget range, timeline. Also, they
4:23:50
can be a lot smaller. So what I can do here is I can take these
4:23:59
I can shift A to add auto layout and then I can change
4:24:05
the uh orientation to horizontal and then I can make sure that both of these
4:24:12
items are set to fill container and then I'm going to take the parent
4:24:19
and I'm going to resize it
4:24:24
to fit my layout. And let's see what happened here.
4:24:31
So, this is set to fill container. Fill container. Oh, we must also set these to
4:24:37
fill container
4:24:43
like so. So now, no matter how much I resize my parent, those two fields will
4:24:50
automatically resize with it, which is awesome. Let's do the exact same thing
4:24:55
for these two elements. So, select shift A,
4:25:02
change this to horizontal and then resize it
4:25:09
while making sure that everything inside is set to fill container.
4:25:17
And we also have some other frames inside this which we need to set as fill
4:25:24
container. Just like that.
4:25:32
and this as well. And of course, project details.
4:25:40
This uh can span the entire width.
4:25:49
So let's make sure fill container is applied everywhere.
4:25:54
And now you'll see that everything resizes
4:26:00
accordingly. Awesome. Now let's see about the button. For that I'll go to my
4:26:05
assets. I'll grab a button from here and then just paste it in. Let's delete the
4:26:12
old one. Also, let's delete this icon because we're going to replace it. So,
4:26:18
let's open our icon set app and let's search for uh an icon that's meaningful
4:26:26
to to this button. So, the button basically
4:26:31
sends a message. So, let's look for a paper plane. Let's look at all the icons
4:26:39
and let's see what icon we can find that has uh the style that we're looking for,
4:26:44
which is kind of an outline style. So, uh, this could probably work,
4:26:50
uh, from Font Awesome. Uh, maybe this one,
4:26:55
which is, um, very, very similar.
4:27:02
Maybe this one from Iron Icons, but I think I'll go with the one from
4:27:09
uh, from Font Awesome V5. So, let's resize this to 32
4:27:15
m. Maybe a bit less. 24. Something like that. Let's make it white.
4:27:24
And maybe for this uh for this button,
4:27:29
we could do it a more clear message. So, let's just say send message. And now
4:27:38
I want to make this button fill in all the available space in the form. So
4:27:45
make it full width basically. So instead of hug contents, I'm going to set it as fill container.
4:27:52
And I'm going to align the text to the middle. And that's it. Now let's take
4:28:00
uh these two elements. Shift A to add auto layout. And I'm
4:28:05
going to align them vertically like so. So then I can take my form, make sure
4:28:13
the distance from it to the section above it is 256 pixels.
4:28:21
And we're almost done. This is the
4:28:27
contact form that we designed. But there's also one last thing we need to do here and that is to
4:28:36
create alternate states for these inputs. Like what
4:28:41
happens when a user focuses the input? How does it look like or when an input
4:28:46
is disabled? Okay, so let's go ahead and take
4:28:52
this element and let's go back to our assets page.
4:28:59
Let's create a frame inside here. You can name the this form controls.
4:29:06
Let's paste that in. Right. So, this would be
4:29:12
the default. Let's do one for uh focus slh. So when we hover with our mouse
4:29:20
over it or when we focus it with, you know, our mouse or our keyboard, uh it's
4:29:26
going to look exactly the same. And when that happens, let's uh do the following.
4:29:33
Let's maybe add a small uh stroke.
4:29:40
So stroke one pixel on the inside. Uh for color, let's add black 25.
4:29:47
And let's also reduce the opacity of the background color to black 10 uh black
4:29:54
five, excuse me. Just like that. And maybe increase the
4:30:02
uh the stroke to black 10
4:30:07
like so. Or I guess we can go one higher. Black 25. Yeah, that should work just fine.
4:30:17
And then let's do another state for disabled. This time we'll take the uh
4:30:24
text color and we'll drop it to like black 50. And also the
4:30:31
stroke color we'll set it to black 10. So it's kind of very very muted. And
4:30:38
then finally let's uh create one alternative for the error state.
4:30:46
Now for the error, how about we do the following?
4:30:53
We also add a stroke. That's going to be the color of
4:30:59
error. But let's make the
4:31:06
background color white. Something like that. And we can even go one step further and make uh the color
4:31:13
of the text red. And that should give us a clear indication that hey there is an
4:31:19
error in this field. So with that done and
4:31:26
with our form complete we actually finished all the common patterns that we
4:31:32
uh set out to explore. We started with the header and then we moved on to the hero to the buttons um the image
4:31:40
gallery. We covered tabs and accordians and we ended up with the contact form.
4:31:46
So now it's your turn to complete or to design the contact form for your version
4:31:52
of uh of the website. And as always be adventurous, try out new things, new
4:31:58
layouts and u see what you come up with. On top of that, you should uh now make
4:32:04
an effort to finish designing the rest of the elements in the website if you haven't already. Uh you saw that I
4:32:11
didn't cover everything because that would make this course way too long. But I did fill in the gaps off camera. So
4:32:19
now my design is complete. And once you've done that, once you've completed the entire design, you're ready to move
4:32:26
on. And we are actually moving on to responsive web design. Now, this is a
4:32:32
it's a pretty big topic, but I'll try and make it as simple as possible while also trying to uh show you how to apply
4:32:41
the principles of responsive web design to certain elements in uh in our project
4:32:47
and uh that's coming up. [Music] All right, let's talk about responsive
What is a responsive website?
4:32:54
websites. And I want to start by telling you a short story. Uh in the early days
4:33:00
of the internet, meaning late '9s, early 2000s, all websites were nonresponsive,
4:33:08
meaning you would create a design, code it, and that would be the final version
4:33:13
for everyone. And that was okay because uh the majority of computers back then
4:33:20
were using uh screens of similar size, usually 800x 600 or 1024x
4:33:30
768. Fast forward to when smartphones started
4:33:35
to become popular and people were using them to browse the internet. But those
4:33:40
small devices had problems displaying websites properly because websites were
4:33:45
designed for much bigger screens. Then came the idea to create a separate
4:33:51
version of the website that would only open on mobile devices while the original version would open on computers
4:33:58
with larger screens. Uh that mobile version would um
4:34:04
be hosted on a subdomain called M. These were also referred to as m dots. So m
4:34:12
dodomain.com that would uh serve a user the mobile
4:34:18
version of that website. Facebook uh even today in 2022 still has that
4:34:24
functionality. If you go to m.fas.com, you'll get a mobile version of Facebook.
4:34:31
And uh that worked for a while, but it soon started to become problematic. First of all, you had two versions of a
4:34:39
website that you needed to manage and that was time consuming. Any change that
4:34:45
you would make to one version of the website, you'd have to make to the other version. Uh second of all, smartphones
4:34:52
started to become more and more popular and more and more companies were making
4:34:57
them in different sizes. And that was the biggest problem of them
4:35:03
all because suddenly your mobile device or your mobile version, excuse me,
4:35:10
wasn't guaranteed to work on every single smartphone size out there. and
4:35:16
creating a separate version for every single smartphone size was just
4:35:21
preposterous. So what to do? Well, thankfully we have an amazing human
4:35:27
being in our community and his name is Ethan Marott. In 2010, he wrote this
4:35:33
article for List a Part where he outlined a new way of thinking about
4:35:39
flexible web design. He named it responsive web design and this term
4:35:45
stuck ever since. And Ethan is actually credited for coining this term. Based on
4:35:51
that article and the widespread adoption of media queries in 2012, uh responsive
4:35:58
web design became a standard. So no more mobile subdomains but instead one
4:36:05
website which will adapt its layout or respond to various screen sizes. That's
4:36:12
the essence of responsive web design. So then what have we learned from this
4:36:19
lesson? Well first of all in the early days of the internet all websites were
4:36:24
nonresponsive. After mobile devices came out, developers were using a subdomain to
4:36:31
serve a mobile version of the website. In 2010, Ethan Marott wrote about
4:36:37
responsive web design and that became the standard that we all use today.
4:36:43
Okay. So, with this short introduction out of the way, um let's see how we can apply some of the principles of
4:36:50
responsive web design to our project that's coming up.
Making layout changes for tablets and phones
4:36:58
Okay. So, first let's see what kind of problems our layouts might face when
4:37:04
displayed on a smaller screen. And after that, we'll uh think about some
4:37:10
solutions. What you see here is the finished design. And as I was saying previously, I kind of filled in the gaps
4:37:17
as we were going along and I completed the um entire design for this project
4:37:25
off camera. And I also did it in a way that allows me to select this main
4:37:31
container for all my elements and resize it. And all the other um elements inside
4:37:39
the container will resize as well. And this way I can easily mimic, you know,
4:37:45
resizing a browser window and um try and see the potential issues that
4:37:53
my layouts can have on different screen sizes. And this is done, of course, in
4:37:59
Figma. It's using the auto layout feature and all the resizing options
4:38:04
like uh hug contents and fill container. that's a bit more advanced and maybe
4:38:11
I'll do a separate course on that in the future. Let us know down in the comments if you would like to see that. But for
4:38:18
now, let's have a look at some of these pages and see the problems that we might
4:38:24
have on smaller screens. So, I'm going to start by resizing the
4:38:30
contents of the homepage. And as you can see, even on uh smaller sizes, things
4:38:37
are still looking pretty good. Let's uh scroll down here. The images because I'm
4:38:43
using them as backgrounds are doing okay, but they are slowly
4:38:48
becoming too tall. Right? So, this is one of the areas that we can improve on.
4:38:56
Also, because I offset this section, for example, by quite a lot, when I'm
4:39:05
getting to smaller screen sizes, I have an imbalance, right? I I have more uh
4:39:13
space here on the left compared to the right side. So on a smaller screen, this
4:39:20
section would be moved to the left. Uh let's uh take a look at the about screen
4:39:27
or the about me page. I'm going to do the same thing.
4:39:34
Here's another issue that we're facing. On smaller screens, this text
4:39:40
should um be a bit wider. And also uh this entire section could be offset by a
4:39:48
smaller margin. So maybe align it with the menu items like this.
4:39:54
Uh the images have the same issue. They kind of resize
4:40:01
widthwise, but they also need to resize like this. They need to be less tall.
4:40:08
Some of these uh columns are starting to become way too crowded
4:40:14
for this screen size. Same goes for the um the testimonials.
4:40:22
And let's take a look at the contact page. Right. So if we start to resize
4:40:27
this one, this is actually doing pretty well. But
4:40:32
we will start to see some problems here in the contact form.
4:40:38
You see the email address is now cut off. So in this instance, instead of using two columns for some of these
4:40:45
fields, I might need to use a single column. So these are the types of
4:40:51
problems that you need to keep an eye out for. Responsive design is not just
4:40:56
about uh you know how the navigation menu will look like on smaller screens and how you
4:41:03
can you know hide that and swap it for like a menu button. It's also about the
4:41:09
content the entire content of the page. How is that
4:41:15
being displayed in smaller screen sizes and the way you can go about that? Well,
4:41:20
there's more than one way actually. And most people will do the following. They
4:41:26
would think, okay, let me design this page at 1,800 pixels, right? At the size
4:41:33
I have here. and maybe they read online, you know, stuff about responsive web
4:41:39
design and break points and they say, "Okay, I'm going to follow the
4:41:44
traditional break points, um, 1024, uh, 768,
4:41:51
480." So, what does that mean? It means that
4:41:56
on those break points, you're going to apply some changes
4:42:01
to your layout. Okay? Uh, but there's a problem with this
4:42:08
approach. Let's say that your layout looks good on
4:42:13
what did we have here? 1,800 pixels, right? And you want to start making
4:42:19
changes at a set break point. Let's say 1024, which is about
4:42:28
let's say about this much. But what if you're having problems with some
4:42:33
elements before that 1024 break point, right? So let's say I'm around, I don't
4:42:40
know, 1,200, something like this. And 1,200 is an area that you're still
4:42:47
having problems with. Well, that's the downside of using like these common
4:42:52
break points because they might work for some layouts, but they might not work
4:42:58
for others. So, my layout could do very
4:43:04
well in the in the range of 1,800 to let's say 1,000.
4:43:10
But other layouts might not. Other layouts might need a change around 1,500
4:43:15
pixels. Right? So relying on those fixed
4:43:21
break points is not ideal. Instead what I do and I started doing uh recently is
4:43:29
use ranges. And I have three ranges defined in my project 1 to 1200 and I
4:43:37
call this a laptop range or a big screen range. Then I have a
4:43:44
tablet range of 1200 to 600. And then I have a phone range with
4:43:51
screen sizes of less than 600 pixels. So what I usually do is I use this um
4:43:59
process in Figma with auto layout and resizing and stuff to create my layouts
4:44:05
in such a way that I can, you know, grab this container and resize it as I see
4:44:11
fit. and I just go slowly until I spot a problem. And when I spot
4:44:20
a problem, that's when I add a break point. So in my case, I started noticing
4:44:26
that around 1,200 pixels, some elements were starting to
4:44:34
be problematic, right? So it's around here. So when my layout is 1200 pixels,
4:44:40
you know, the images are getting a little bit too big here. Uh this section
4:44:45
on the bottom will have will start to have more space on the left compared to
4:44:51
on the right. And the same goes for the other pages as well. For example, if I
4:44:58
resize this bit to 1200 pixels, if I look at the layout, then it's still
4:45:05
acceptable, right? Apart from the email address being a bit too long, but that's not such a big deal. The rest of the
4:45:12
elements still look good. But as soon as I go under 1,200 pixels, uh, some of the
4:45:19
problems are starting to become more and more obvious. So then
4:45:27
I set up a break point at 1200 pixels.
4:45:33
So that means that this is the time I start making changes. And what exactly did I change?
4:45:41
Well, let me show you. And I'm actually going to open the Figma desktop app for this because it seems that uh some of
4:45:48
the elements are not displayed uh correctly in the um in the browser
4:45:53
version. So at 1200 pixels, I did the following. I moved the menu items in a
4:46:02
hidden menu that can be accessed by clicking this button. So the header is
4:46:08
now different. It looks like this. Let me actually hide the interface here.
4:46:16
I also started tweaking the font sizes
4:46:23
for my type scale. So if we look at the uh typography section here, I have
4:46:31
three different type scales. I have one for laptop and above which is
4:46:38
using um 21 pixel font size as a base and 1414 ratio. So
4:46:46
this is the scale that I've been using in this whole design process. But then
4:46:52
for tablet or that 1200 to 600 range.
4:46:59
I lowered the base font size from 21 to 18 pixels using the same ratio but lower
4:47:09
font size lower base font size and that gave me another type scale than I that I
4:47:16
can use. So for the laptop range, I replaced
4:47:21
or I updated the font sizes on all the elements.
4:47:27
And then for the phone version, I have yet another
4:47:34
type scale. This time 18 pixel base, but I changed the ratio.
4:47:40
And I did that so that there wouldn't be so much contrast between the smaller font sizes and the bigger font sizes.
4:47:48
Because if you think about it on a mobile phone, you don't want to see super big font sizes. It's just going to
4:47:54
take up too much space. So you need to work on the typography scale a little
4:48:00
bit to, you know, have a difference between the headings and the base font
4:48:07
size. But it doesn't have to be that much of a difference if you know what I mean. So then I of course went and got
4:48:15
this type scale and I applied it to the
4:48:20
phone range. As you can see the font sizes for the headings
4:48:28
are lower here than they are on the tablets.
4:48:34
And of course much lower than what I have here on the uh on the main design,
4:48:40
the one for larger screens. So that's one part taking care of the typography.
4:48:46
I also started shrinking the distances, the
4:48:52
margins, the paddings. As we're going lower and lower in terms of screen size,
4:48:58
those distances need to get lower and lower as well because on smaller
4:49:03
screens, you don't have a lot of real estate to work with. So, you got to make sure that you're not wasting it by
4:49:11
using, you know, too much white space. So to give you an actual example,
4:49:18
the distance between each major section on large screens is 256.
4:49:25
On the tablet, that distance is reduced to 168.
4:49:35
And on smaller screens, the phone range, that
4:49:40
distance is only 96. And I did the same for the rest. For
4:49:48
example, if you remember on the large screens, the distance between this text
4:49:53
and this button was 96 pixels, but on the phone it's 64 pixels.
4:50:00
So, we're doing, you know, incremental smaller changes that will basically
4:50:06
allow our content to display properly on these smaller screens, but at the same
4:50:12
time without, you know, compromising uh readability and without making the
4:50:19
layout look too cramped. So then um once I did that,
4:50:24
it was time to work on other areas that needed fixing. For example, the height
4:50:31
of these images. Remember, if we look here in the homepage, this
4:50:37
image was 96 pixels in height. Here it's 640 pixels in height. And that
4:50:45
means that I can now resize it and still get a good enough ratio on the on the
4:50:52
image. Uh I also moved this section
4:50:58
a bit more to the left. So now when I resize,
4:51:04
I still get good spacing to the left and to the
4:51:10
right of the section without that imbalance that I told you earlier.
4:51:16
What else? In the contact page,
4:51:21
I also did a couple of things here. First of all, instead of the two column
4:51:27
layout I was using on the contact form section, I now have one column
4:51:33
with the uh text on the top and then the contact form at the bottom.
4:51:40
And also notice the contact form now uses full width for the first two form
4:51:47
fields on the large screens. These were uh sharing one column each.
4:51:58
Also the footer is different. Here is the footer on
4:52:05
uh a larger screen. All right. So it's displayed like this. contact uh copyright info,
4:52:13
menu, social icons display displayed on one row. But if we look here,
4:52:21
everything is now stacked one on top of the other. So that means
4:52:28
that I can now resize this
4:52:33
and it's still going to look great. So those were the changes that I made for
4:52:39
this range 1,200 to 600. Now how did I get to this
4:52:46
600 number? Well, I repeated the exact process. I started resizing my content
4:52:54
until I could see some problems emerging. And that's when I added
4:53:00
another break point. In my case, it was around 600 pixels. So on 600 pixels
4:53:08
when we have a very very small screen to work with. I have yet another version of
4:53:14
the header without the social icons. This time the logos here
4:53:21
are starting to become stacked. I made these images even smaller in
4:53:28
height 320 pixels. And then I also checked uh what was
4:53:35
happening on the other pages uh in uh in the about me page. This gallery is now
4:53:41
stacked. And on the contact page also a few changes on the contact form
4:53:50
to be more uh specific. All the form fields are now full width. in tablet
4:53:57
mode. These last two were actually being displayed on one column each. So these
4:54:04
are, you know, the the changes that you need to make. You need to see, okay,
4:54:10
typography wise on smaller screens. Is the text too big in certain areas? If it
4:54:18
is, go ahead and change it. use a different type scale, you know, and you
4:54:23
can reduce either the base font size or the ratio like we did for the smaller
4:54:30
range here. And then you got to check each section of your website. How does
4:54:36
it look when I make it this small? Maybe there are some sections that need
4:54:41
to uh be displayed stacked like for example in the footer.
4:54:48
Or maybe there are some things that I need to hide completely like we did for
4:54:54
the navigation menu right here starting with the tablet range and also these
4:54:59
social media icons that uh are completely hidden on mobile devices. And
4:55:06
that's all there is to it, right? It's kind of a recursive process. You just got to go back and forth, see what
4:55:12
works, what doesn't work on a specific range, and then make the necessary
4:55:20
adjustments. Now, I only showed you a few changes here and uh you can see the
4:55:27
full um website design, including the uh responsive versions uh if you uh check
4:55:33
out the link in the video description, and you'll see exactly how I approached this problem. Now, it's your turn. So,
4:55:41
if you've been um you know, doing things differently than me, then awesome. Uh but it also means that you have to do
4:55:48
the responsive changes yourself. You cannot just copy uh everything I did
4:55:54
because the layouts will probably be different. But yeah, now it's up to you.
4:56:00
Go ahead and make the responsive changes and do exactly as I said. Just uh go
4:56:06
through each section, resize it, uh see how it works on smaller screens. Uh you
4:56:12
might need to reposition some of the items manually if you're not using auto layout like I was, but you know it's a
4:56:20
learning process. So I'm sure that at some point you'll get the hang of it. But yeah, once you do that, uh you'll
4:56:27
also come across a few components that will probably get you wondering like
4:56:35
let's say tabs. How do you make that into a responsive component? Well, let
4:56:41
me show you uh in the next lesson. [Music]
Making a component responsive
4:56:47
Making a website responsive is not a very difficult task, but every now and
4:56:53
then you're going to stumble upon a certain UI component that's going to give you a hard time. Uh for example,
4:57:00
tables. Now, we don't have any tables in our design, but we do have tabs. And
4:57:06
this can prove uh or these can prove to be problematic at times. So in this uh
4:57:12
lesson I'm going to show you how to make a tab component responsive. Let's go. So
4:57:20
we are back here in Figma and this is our starting point, right? We have this
4:57:27
uh tab control that allow us to see the tools that our client uses for both
4:57:33
design and development. And the version we've designed right here works really
4:57:39
well on larger screens. But what about smaller screens? So,
4:57:44
let's go ahead and copy this. And I'm just going to create a blank
4:57:52
frame here. We'll just make it 1,800.
4:58:00
And let's make it a bit smaller. This will serve as uh as our playing ground
4:58:06
like so. Let's paste that in. And now we'll do the following. And let me
4:58:12
actually make this bigger again. And I'm going to duplicate this. And I'll try
4:58:17
and make it fit inside a 1200 pixel container. For that,
4:58:25
let's draw a rectangle that's 1200. And let's go ahead and add some guides here just
4:58:32
so we can see what the boundaries are. So now we can delete that. So then we'll
4:58:39
resize this bit to 1200.
4:58:46
I'm also going to resize this like so. And as you can see when it's
4:58:53
1200 pixels, it still looks pretty good. But as soon as I start
4:59:00
making it even smaller, then we're getting to a point where we see changes that are not exactly right.
4:59:08
The text here goes on two rows. Maybe these are getting a little bit too
4:59:13
cramped for you. So, let's try and find an alternative for that.
4:59:19
And remember the version that we're designing now should work very well
4:59:24
between 1,200 and 600 pixels which is the uh the limit or the range that we
4:59:31
defined for our project. So when I make the 600 pixels you can see that we have
4:59:38
a lot of problems on both um these elements here as well as on the tab
4:59:45
links. So let's actually start with the tab links. This is a pretty easy fix.
4:59:52
All you have to do is re remove the parts that are repeating themselves. And in our case, it's the text tools I use
5:00:00
for I use it here. I use it here. So if I remove that and I also remove that,
5:00:09
suddenly we have fixed the tab links.
5:00:16
Right now, they fit nicely in the range of 1,200
5:00:23
to 600, which is about here. Now, let's see what to do about
5:00:30
these items. And the easiest thing to do is make them
5:00:37
smaller, obviously, but also stack them. When you don't have enough space horizontally, you can start stacking
5:00:43
items. And here's what we'll do. Let's make this um Oops.
5:00:52
Let's resize this back up. And we'll do the following. We'll select
5:00:58
each one of these items and we'll switch the auto layout from vertical to horizontal.
5:01:06
We'll then select all of the icons and we'll make them a little bit smaller, 32 pixels instead of
5:01:14
48. And then again, we'll select everything and we'll switch the padding
5:01:20
around items from 32 to 24. And also the
5:01:26
text elements, select them and instead of fixed width, just set them to hug contents. And also
5:01:34
we have a fixed height. defined here. Just select hug contents. So now we have
5:01:41
to stack them. And probably the easiest would be to just stack two of them on
5:01:47
one row. So you would do the following. We have a big parent element here called
5:01:54
tool list that lists these elements horizontally like this. And then each
5:02:00
item is represented by what I called here column. So, I'm going to select two
5:02:06
of them. Shift A to group them up. Then the next two. Shift A.
5:02:14
And this one I can just leave by itself. So now I can go to the parent
5:02:19
container which is tool list and I can change the direction
5:02:25
to vertical. And also the height I'm going to set it to hug contents. Now, we
5:02:31
seem to have uh a small issue with some of the elements here. Let's just change
5:02:38
hug contents. Hug contents. Figma does that weird uh thing sometimes. So, now
5:02:44
we can select the parent and make sure everything is aligned to the middle. And
5:02:50
then you can see that some of the elements don't quite resize according to to their
5:02:58
contents. So we can select that hug contents and let's do it for all of them.
5:03:12
Just like that. So now even if we resize this to 600
5:03:21
pixels and even lower than that, it's still
5:03:26
going to look great. But we can't go too low like for example 355
5:03:33
because then we'll start getting into problems. So for that we need to do yet another
5:03:40
version. So the one that we have now the second one works very well in the range
5:03:46
of 1200 to 600. Now, we're going to duplicate this.
5:03:54
And let's use a side of 600 pixels here to
5:04:02
drag some guides. And let's resize this to 600 pixels.
5:04:13
So then for this third version, which should work on screens that are less than 600
5:04:20
pixels, let's see what happens if we start resizing.
5:04:25
We get into the issue of not having enough space on the top. Possible
5:04:31
solutions. Well, we could probably decrease the amount of padding that we
5:04:37
have on some of these uh buttons, like for example 24 instead of 48, and that
5:04:44
would partially solve the problem. But it would also
5:04:50
compromise on how this looks, and I don't want to do that.
5:04:55
Instead, a pretty good solution for this is to replace the text with some icons.
5:05:04
So, I went ahead, I searched for some icons that could, you know, in theory
5:05:09
replace the word design or are related in some way to the word design. And I
5:05:16
found this a 32x 32 pixel icon of this
5:05:22
roller. And then what I can do is simply get rid of the word design.
5:05:28
And I'm also going to set a 16 pixel padding on the entire
5:05:35
button. And also I'm going to set its width to fill container. And then I'm going to
5:05:42
target its parent and I'm going to set it to fill container like this.
5:05:48
And then let's center that icon. And the first uh button is ready for
5:05:55
development. I did exactly the same thing and I got this icon.
5:06:02
So let's remove the text as well. Let's set a 16 pixel padding here. And
5:06:10
let's set the resizing to fill container and this to the middle.
5:06:17
So now because we have icons instead of the text and we also reduced
5:06:26
the uh padding on those items, I can now resize
5:06:36
my elements and they're still going to look great even on extreme or extremely
5:06:41
low widths like 200 pixels. So by making this I ensure that it's going to look
5:06:47
great no matter what. Now let's see about these elements here.
5:06:54
Because it's about a small screen, we're going to stack absolutely everything and
5:06:59
we're going to make it full width. So, first things first,
5:07:04
we need to ungroup the items that um we grouped earlier
5:07:10
and then select each one and set its width to fill
5:07:16
container. Just like that. And we're done. Now, I can resize this
5:07:24
and it's going to look good even on very small screen sizes.
5:07:31
And of course, if you want to go like even smaller, you know, you find these
5:07:37
problems with the text not being exactly as it
5:07:42
should. It's way too big in our case, you can simply go and change the font
5:07:48
size to something smaller, maybe 18 pixels or something like that. But in my
5:07:56
case, I seriously doubt there are any screens
5:08:01
that are 200 pixels wide. So,
5:08:08
this solution will work just fine. Another solution would be to simply get
5:08:14
rid of the icons, you know, when screens are getting really, really, really small
5:08:19
and just keep uh the text. And then finally, one last touch here
5:08:26
would be to reduce the distance between these elements from 96 to 64.
5:08:33
Just like that. And this is how you make a component
5:08:39
responsive. We started with the big version
5:08:44
or the version that we use for bigger screens. Then for the 1,200 to 600 range, we're
5:08:52
using this version, which works well between those two break points. And then
5:08:57
anything that's under 600, we'll be using this version. All right. And with
5:09:04
that, it's almost lights out. We successfully designed a three-page
5:09:10
website based on a project brief and a wireframe. And we also made sure that
5:09:16
our design looks good on smaller screens by uh applying some responsive design
5:09:22
principles. Now where do we go from here? Well, technically it's job done
5:09:29
for the web designer. You can take the design, ship it to a developer, and
5:09:36
they'll take it from there. But there's actually one extra step that you could do, and that is called prototyping. And
5:09:43
before we end the course, I want to briefly talk about this because I feel uh it's uh it's pretty important. So
5:09:51
that's coming up. [Music] So what is a prototype? Well, it's
A quick word about prototyping
5:09:59
basically an interactive mockup of your design. It doesn't necessarily mean the
5:10:04
final version of your design, but instead a version that allows you to
5:10:11
better see the functionality and the user's journey throughout the
5:10:17
the website or the web app, whatever it is that you're building. A prototype
5:10:22
allows you to link between screens and demonstrate how the website will
5:10:27
function before the actual development has started. So for example, you can set
5:10:34
the links or the menu items to take you to the corresponding pages when you
5:10:39
click on them. And prototyping is very useful for identifying areas of
5:10:45
improvement in your design before it gets to the
5:10:51
development stage. Uh you can create prototypes in pretty much any major uh UI design software
5:10:59
nowadays. Uh but there are also dedicated apps just for prototyping. But
5:11:06
uh you can do that really easily in Figma, Adobe XD and so on. And uh right
5:11:12
now I want to give you a quick demo of how to create a prototype in Figma. So
5:11:18
this is my finished website. And let's say that before I send it off to
5:11:23
development, I want to show the client how it functions. How would a user get
5:11:32
from point A to point B? So to do that, notice that in Figma, we have uh three
5:11:38
tabs here, design, prototype, and inspect. We need to switch to the prototype tab. And what you do is you
5:11:48
select an element, let's say about me. And then I want to I want this link to
5:11:55
take me to the about me page when I click on it. So I hover until I get the
5:12:02
blue plus sign here. And then I just click and drag
5:12:10
to the about me page. And that's going to open up this model telling me, hey,
5:12:15
interaction details. How do you want the the interaction to be? And I'm going to select on click, navigate to the about
5:12:24
me page, and I can also uh select an animation. Is it instant, smart animate,
5:12:30
move in, move out? Uh there are a bunch of options here. Let's um choose
5:12:35
instant. And also I'm going to select the contact
5:12:41
link
5:12:48
and I'm going to have this take me to the contact page.
5:12:53
So now once I made these connections I can simply click the play button.
5:12:58
That's going to open a new window for uh prototyping. And inside prototyping, I can basically
5:13:06
just see the entire design.
5:13:11
But then when I click about me, well, that's going to take me to the
5:13:17
about me page. Then if I go to the about me page and I select the contact
5:13:25
link, I'm going to tell it to take me to the contact page. So now if I open up the prototype again.
5:13:33
So now I can click about me that's going to take me to the about me page. And then clicking contact will take me to
5:13:40
the contact page. And you can do this for every single element out there.
5:13:47
Maybe you want this um button here that says see my
5:13:53
work. Let's go ahead and create an interaction for that. And I want to tell it to take me to
5:14:00
this section here. Right. So on click, I want it to scroll to my work. And let's
5:14:08
add also an animation. And let's see how that goes. All right.
5:14:14
So I'm going to scroll down. And when I click this button, it's going to take me to my work. Now
5:14:20
obviously there are options here. uh you know you can fit the width
5:14:29
and that's going to work much better. So that's what prototyping is about really.
5:14:35
Of course you can get really creative with it. Uh it's not just about moving from page to page. You can scroll to
5:14:42
various elements and you have a bunch of other uh interactions here. for example,
5:14:50
on drag, while hovering, while pressed. You can also press a key. Uh you can
5:14:55
also tap into the mouse events here. So, you can certainly do a lot, but at its
5:15:00
core, prototyping is used for simulating how the the user will navigate through
5:15:09
the website. And it can turn out to be very
5:15:15
beneficial because you can spot certain problems before uh the actual
5:15:20
development starts. And with that said, let's have a look at some key takeaways.
5:15:26
A prototype is an interactive mockup of your design that allows you to see the
5:15:31
functionality and the user's journey. A prototype allows you to link between
5:15:37
screens and demonstrate how the website will function before the actual development has started. Prototyping
5:15:45
allows you to identify areas of improvement long before the project goes into development. All major UI design
5:15:53
apps offer prototyping features. And there you have it. That's a very short
5:15:58
introduction to prototyping. Uh we're at the end of this course. So for the
5:16:04
conclusion, we'll have a look at next steps and some key takeaways. That's
5:16:10
coming up. [Music] Well, that was a big course. Uh 36
Next steps and key takeaways
5:16:17
lessons, over 3 hours long, and a lot of hopefully useful information. So,
5:16:23
congrats for finishing it. I hope you learned something new. And if you have any questions or comments, please leave
5:16:31
a comment down below. Now, what should you do next? Well, I strongly encourage
5:16:36
you to do the assignment. That's a very practical exercise, and it's going to help you lock in uh those theory bits
5:16:44
that you learned during the course. And you can do it side by side as you're watching the course, or you can do it
5:16:50
after that. It's really up to you. But I recommend you do it side by side. I
5:16:55
think it's much easier like that. And that's actually how I designed uh this course. I would give you a bit of theory
5:17:03
and then a bit of practice and then it would be your turn to um to do that part
5:17:11
of the uh of the assignment. As for the key takeaways, well, there's a lot to
5:17:17
say in a course this size, but I don't want to drag this for too long. So, I'm
5:17:22
just going to say this. Always start a project on the UX side of things. That
5:17:28
includes a project brief and wireframes. Pick the right design tool. Stay away
5:17:34
from Photoshop or Illustrator and work with something that's made for UI and UX
5:17:40
design. Study the fundamentals as much as you can. Color, typography, spacing,
5:17:46
sizing, and imagery. Get to know the most common web design patterns and see
5:17:52
how other people are using them. And finally, when designing website, make
5:17:57
sure it looks good on smaller or larger screens. Responsive web design is
5:18:02
critical. And that's it from me. Thank you very much for watching and don't forget to check out the Invato Tuts Plus
5:18:09
YouTube channel to learn more about WordPress, Figma, Adobe XD, and much
5:18:16
more. I'm AI and until next time, take care. Uh this is this refer first
5:18:23
project brief coming. Okay. Okay. Okay. The that goes by doing
5:18:32
this we're mixically we're mixally Jesus what what
5:18:38
the word don't blame

going to be showing you I'm going to be giving you a proven framework on how to remove yourself from this company from
2:15
the day-to-day operations while the business keeps growing now I know you're probably thinking that won't work but
2:21
just have an open mind going into this training because we did it firsthand and I'm going to be showing you step by step
2:29
how we did that these strategies will be key if you want to grow to multiple six figures per year in recurring income
2:37
meaning even if you get no new clients you are still making money every single
2:43
month I haven't seen anyone launch a course like this that's paid let alone completely free like you're watching
2:49
right now I'll be giving you full import links and website samples full contracts you can use with your clients full
2:56
checklists you can even hand off and use yourself and also everything in between
3:02
to manage and run this company and by the way even with successful website Freelancers there're still a big problem
3:09
one month they might make thousands and thousands of dollars but then the next month they're back to zero they are
3:15
working and grinding they're on a hamster wheel of constantly trying to get new clients they work hard and then
3:21
they neglect their client getting processes and systems in their business and so they're always grinding always
3:28
working for that next client what kind of business is this there is no steady
3:34
and predictable income with this model now look once you see the third step in our process you'll get that aha moment
3:41
everything will click and make sense and you'll be wondering why you didn't do this from the beginning so let's dive in
3:47
this training was done in front of a live audience and divided into three separate days now the host occasionally
3:54
stops me and asks me clarifying questions so let's dive in here's exactly what we're going to cover in day
4:01
one we'll cover the business setup everything about the old website design model versus the new model picking a
4:07
niche picking an industry that you can work with and actually charge high prices and they'll be willing to pay
4:13
them everything about crafting your offer your packaging and making sure that people actually want it everything
4:19
else that you can offer with web design and then pricing and payments how to
4:24
collect money from your prospects now day two we'll cover the sales proc
4:29
process and actually finding clients how to find clients how to get them interested our copy paste messages how
4:36
to actually sign them setting appointments like a professional and then day three is what happens after you
4:42
sign the actual client how to deliver the services how to grow your business how to automate your business I'll be
4:48
breaking down our entire assembly line process that automates a lot of this
4:54
stuff we're going to talk about onboarding importing everything building the actual websites project managing and
5:00
then even scaling your company with $4 per hour virtual assistance that can run
5:05
everything or help you even book more appointments with potential clients and then the next steps on how to scale past
5:12
$1,000 $20,000 a month and why most bottleneck at about 3 to 6,000 per month
5:19
now I know all of this sounds amazing fun and exciting but I do want to warn you not to skip around because if you're
5:25
just curious on how to sign clients but you don't understand this new model that we have it won't make sense once we
5:32
actually start reaching out to them if you want to learn about how to hire virtual assistants but you don't know how the business model Works how we
5:39
actually sign clients how we deliver those Services things won't make sense so if you skip around you're just going
5:45
to get confused watch this all the way through if you want to maximize the benefits now I also want you to sit with
5:52
a notepad grab a pen and take down notes jot down what you found was interesting
5:58
or important because this is going to maximize the benefits that you are going to get from this video now real quick
6:04
before we dive into the meat and potatoes who is pava who am I and why
6:09
should you even listen to what I am saying the first thing is I started from
6:15
nothing we had nothing we came to America I'm a Ukrainian immigrant with
6:21
$56 in our bank account in our pocket actually we didn't even have a bank
6:26
account here in the US we came here in Refugee status I've been broke my entire life we came here and we had no
6:33
connections no people to rely on no people that we knew and no one was
6:39
giving us a handout I remember going to school and both my parents worked two jobs while also trying to learn English
6:46
so I never saw them and I was in after school programs and this and that and a whole bunch of other stuff now let's
6:52
fast forward I started my agency in 2017 but it works now better than ever before
6:59
I wish wish I had all of these tools that we're going to be covering in this training and I wish I had someone else
7:05
that gave me the blueprint like I'm going to be giving you here today we
7:10
didn't have any of this building a website used to be very very difficult and being a web designer required code
7:16
and you had to learn HTML and CSS and a whole bunch of other stuff so these
7:22
Services have gotten way easier and we're getting clients now way faster than ever we just signed on a client
7:29
yesterday and delivering the services was insanely quick and easy now I started traveling full-time with this
7:35
model in 2019 it doesn't mean I was rich or made that much money but I was making
7:40
a fulltime income now as you can see it took me a couple years to actually figure this out because I had no
7:47
direction and I had no handholding now if you fast forward to this day I send
7:53
my mom a full-time salary every single month and everything is going extreme
8:00
well I'm now making over 100K per month between all the businesses all online
8:05
I've coached more than 2,000 people that are inside our monthly private community that have chosen to stay month in and
8:13
month out because of our Frameworks and in the bottom right is a photo of me in Brazil with a bunch of my friends we're
8:19
doing an event in the favellas and this is only possible because I'm able to travel full-time with this business now
8:26
I'm going to show you a couple wins within our community just to show you that it does not just work for me at the
8:33
top left here we have Jose got a first day first sale with Pav's strategy then we had someone else say they had a small
8:39
win book 28 demo presentations for the week he was super excited because this
8:45
was the first time that he actually saw this kind of success then at the top we have Sydney who closed her second MedSpa client for a three-month contract at
8:51
$7,000 and a whole bunch of other people I'll let you read these testimonials if you want just so you know they're there
8:57
and then we have way more on our website as well but a warning this does take time okay I started in the marketing
9:04
space over 7 years ago now it takes hard work sometimes this could even take 10
9:10
to 12 hours per day everyone starts off at a different point if you're going
9:16
from beginning meaning you have zero clients you have nothing the first few clients will always be the hardest but
9:24
at the end of the day it is still so so worth it this is not a Magic Bullet this
9:30
is not a magic pill that's just going to work and copy and paste and it's just easy and you're going to sit back on a
9:37
beach no you're going to have to figure this out you're going to have to put this together and then yes you can
9:43
automate it and Outsource it but it is hard work now I want you to think about
9:49
how much time and money people actually invest in college or investment
9:54
properties to make this level of income if you really think about it if you signed on three clients at $300 per
10:01
month which is not going to be very difficult I have live sales call recordings of me doing just that with
10:07
the services that I'm going to be teaching you okay you will make $900 per
10:13
month there are people that invest six figures into six figures into a rental
10:19
property and they'll be happy to make $900 per month in profit and you don't
10:25
have to invest any of that that's the crazy part about this model you can push
10:30
this for as far as you want if you want to make a full-time income you want to make this a sixf figure income or you
10:35
just maybe want to use this to help you pay your rent it doesn't matter this can
10:40
work and you can choose how fast and how large you want to grow it so how did I
10:46
actually stumble upon this business model my first year I got three clients
10:52
and I wasn't good at any of this this was difficult for me every part of this
10:59
process and even as I got better by the way I still had to find a job so that was my skill that I initially learned I
11:06
started off in web design this is what I did my first job that I landed in web design I needed something to get out of
11:13
my situation and I ended up dropping out of college I did go for two years and I
11:19
I did end up getting a degree I was I was supposed to continue and get my bachelor's and I I decided not to do
11:24
that and I went all in on the web design business and I needed something so I actually learned how to code I learned
11:30
how to write HTML learned how to write CSS JavaScript PHP and my first job that
11:36
I landed I had to handr write code on a piece of paper like physically on a
11:41
piece of paper and I landed that job so my background isn't code definitely not sales and um this is
11:50
what I had to do but as I started working that job and as I was making a a
11:56
pretty decent income I realized that sitting in a in a cubicle my whole life
12:01
isn't what I wanted that's not the reason we came to this country that is not the reason that I got into this
12:08
business I needed money so I was working it of course it did also teach me a lot it
12:14
taught me how to build good websites taught me how to build High converting websites it also taught me you know business things why people actually sign
12:20
up for websites but at the end of the day I
12:25
still felt like it sucked because I saw how much they were charging for their
12:30
websites 5 67,000 for a custom website and that gave me enough
12:38
confidence to actually charge what my websites were actually worth I started charging at first 2,000 3,000 $4,000 for
12:46
a website and by the way when I said these prices I was shaking like that was very hard for me the first time I
12:52
charged over $1,000 for a website is I went into a meeting and I had just finished a negotiation book and in that
12:59
book it said let the other person give you an offer first so I went to this meeting and I asked him he already met
13:05
with another web designer and I asked him what did this person quote you what price did they give you and he told me
13:13
they quoted him $2,000 now I came into that meeting and I was going to offer him this service for
13:20
$800 now guess what because he told me it's 2,000 I was able to say okay I'll
13:26
do it for500 and we can get started today and I ended up closing him and that was
13:31
my most expensive website that I sold this is in year two by the way no recurring Services just one
13:38
time and even though I was very happy and very proud of this the downside of
13:44
this business is it's very much so feast and famine one month you can make right you
13:52
get two clients maybe that's 3,000 a month or maybe later on I got better and I started charging 3,000 4,000 for a new
13:58
website so sure one month you get two clients let's say you made
14:04
$67,000 you feel amazing you feel so great because you're making thousands of
14:09
dollars per month now however what happens the next month
14:15
the next month you start from zero no monthly
14:21
subscriptions no reoccurring income does this sound like a real business to
14:27
you most likely not if you're anything like me and this really hit me one day this
14:35
really hit me because I was coming home from work right from this same job and I remember coming home I would typically
14:41
after traffic and everything I got home and it was about 5:30 maybe closer to
14:47
600 and my mom got home at about sometime between 6:00 and 6:30 6:15 6:30
14:52
and I remember walking in and seeing the expression on my mom's
14:58
face and I saw how tired she was she was working 12-hour days and she got home
15:05
and it was just this face of exhaustion she was grinding all day now
15:11
we also have a puppy and I asked her if she wanted to take the dog out with me take it out for a walk and she was so
15:19
tired and so exhausted that she didn't want to go with me she got home and she
15:25
just sat on the couch and I started noticing and this has happened before but for some reason this day really
15:30
stuck out to me because it just hit me she spends all
15:35
day at work and she comes home and she's in this half asleep half awake tired
15:42
mindset and what kind of way is this to live did we really struggle all this way
15:49
to come here to America to sit here on a couch and not even have the energy to
15:56
enjoy anything outside of work now sadly this isn't an uncommon site I think a
16:01
lot of people live this way we lived paycheck to paycheck so it's not even like we're working towards something we never took vacations we never had any of
16:08
that and it just hit me that I'm grinding here and I'm trying to build
16:13
this business which by the way we all know it's it's more of a side gig right if you're doing one-off projects that's
16:20
not a business it's a side gig it's all that it is it's
16:26
oneoff and it hit me that this isn't just about you this isn't just about me
16:33
right it's not just about signing clients for yourself so you could be free and maybe quit your job or maybe
16:39
grow your business but it's about the people that are around you and I realize there's no way in my
16:47
future when I have a family there's no way I'm going to sustain myself with this absolutely no way let alone help my
16:54
mom retire let alone help my family actually live a good life so they're not
16:59
just coming home and not having any any
17:06
energy and that motivated me and that fueled me to keep grinding and to keep
17:11
working waking up before my job staying after my job going to a Barnes & Noble
17:17
or to a bookstore or to a library or to a Wei workor or to a Starbucks and working on my
17:24
business and I use that as fuel I use that as motivation that's what worked for
17:31
me and at the end of the day I think that is the big benefit of all this
17:36
right we're not just building this website model and this and that so we can make more money that's great but
17:41
what are you actually going to do with that money chances are you probably have a family that isn't necessarily retired
17:48
or maybe they can't retire and they're not going to actually tell you hey I wish you paid me a salary
17:55
right very selfish but realistically that's probably what they wish you did and that's my fuel and that's my
18:04
motivation so let's actually dive into this training so who is this for this is for
18:09
two people the first person is the actual web designer the skilled web designer
18:16
like I was WordPress web flow whatever platform you use maybe you hand code
18:22
websites this can be for you as well it is for the skilled individual
18:29
that wants to create a reoccurring business because on the backbone of this business you can upsell your custom
18:34
website Services while building a longterm steady monthly recurring business the other person that this is
18:42
for is for either the go high level expert or someone that's brand new to go high level and doesn't even know how to
18:48
use the automations you can be a beginner and use this model to get monthly recurring clients paying you 150
18:56
a month 300 a month 500 a month it depends you I'm going to show you what additional Services you can offer with
19:02
the website in a day program with our website designs even if you don't know
19:07
much about web design I'll show you the basics of what you need to succeed in that business and what business owners
19:13
more importantly what your clients and what business owners actually need at
19:18
the end of the day that is the most important thing so let's dive into our
19:24
lead offer so the website in a day how does it actually work we create one website
19:31
template for one Niche and we reuse that for everyone we tell people that we
19:38
built them a free website and then ask them if they want to see
19:44
it once they say yes we're going to duplicate that template we're going to
19:50
add their logo at the top and we're going to show it to potential clients on zoom and they are going to pay us a
19:57
monthly hosting fee if they want to keep it we're going to launch it on their domain as well now from there you're
20:05
going to upsell different Services as they need them including custom website
20:11
if they want something Beyond that's just copy and paste right they want to change a bunch of stuff on this
20:16
website and they want to change something outside of your highlevel copy and paste website that
20:23
you built then they're going to have to pay more we do have a more advanced option
20:31
so I'll just show you this very briefly and then we'll dive back into the slides so if you are on the SAS plan you can
20:37
actually automate a lot of this for example you can have this kind of package on your website right they
20:42
choose it they hit the free trial they type in their details right and then it automatically
20:48
creates the website so they fill out an onboarding form looks like this boom they put in all their details
20:55
automatically builds in a website like this automatically Imports it and so it looks like this they type it in boom all
21:01
the content is done again I'm not going to spend too much time on this but essentially all you would have to do is
21:06
just launch and Link the client just like that give them the content uh or sorry give them access to your CRM to
21:14
your high level and then it is all done and then you just simply upsell the other services so you can actually
21:20
automate the the website in a day program like this they fill out the form website gets done so here's the process
21:26
right prospecting reach you're going to reach out then you're going to go on Zoom you're going to do a zoom demo you're going to
21:31
give value you're going to sell them their website in a day so you're going to get a website in day client or or
21:36
you'll do a custom website if they actually need more than just the cop something that's copy and paste then
21:43
we're going to onboard them then you're going to Auto enroll them into SAS and you're going to give them the first month free and again we'll go way more
21:50
in depth into EV each and every one of these steps guys so I'll cover that as as we go into it this is just the the uh
21:57
overarching bird's eye view here then you're going to enroll them into a paying monthly retainer then you're going to upsell them and then you're
22:03
going to collect case studies and you're going to collect referrals so what is
22:08
the benefit of this of doing it this way of selling your SAS this way of selling
22:14
your website services this way it doesn't sound salesy it's hard to say no
22:21
to an offer that is so good it gets your foot in the door in a value driven way
22:27
so they actually have a reason to jump on Zoom how many people say hey let's
22:33
book in a call and immediately it sounds like you're booking a sales call not like a demo call where you're showing
22:40
them something that you've done for free even though it takes you 5 minutes right
22:45
we all know how the website template Works in high level you take it you hit copy you just put their logo on it and it's done less than five
22:51
minutes it catches the prospect off guard because it sounds different and they want to see what you actually have
22:59
for them because of how we phrase our Outreach messages this concept works for
23:04
all channels and on day two I'm going to cover literally live sales calls that I've done live Outreach that I've done
23:11
and I'm going to show that to you but this works on everything DMS emails code
23:17
calling you can watch me do this Live on YouTube I booked four meetings before lunchtime in a couple hours in person as
23:24
well so let's go over the pricing the website in a day I like to charge
23:31
$150 per month this is just for hosting you duplicate a template you
23:37
customize a couple things you give it to them they pay you $150 per month to keep
23:43
it up on their domain on their website they're not paying for SEO
23:48
they're not paying for any optimization they're just paying to have a website up which a lot of times is still a massive benefit to them because if a website if
23:56
a client has a really bad website a or no website at
24:02
all that client that business is missing out on so much new opportunity and so much new
24:09
business because they're just not trusted right if you're hiring someone to fix your roof or to remodel your
24:15
kitchen let's say that's a big thing right your kitchen is in the middle of your house it's a big you spend a lot of time in your kitchen you go to someone's
24:22
website and it looks like it's a website from 1990 or just an old website or a crappy website or even a website that's
24:28
just not optimized meaning they don't have their reviews at the top they have no photos of their work you're not going
24:33
to trust them versus someone else that does and that's what we're doing if you
24:38
offer a website in a day with SAS I recommend you charge $300 a month you can charge 500 if you have better sales
24:44
skills and whatever if you're doing more custom work you can charge 500 custom
24:50
website I recommend you charge four to $6,000 for that custom website you can
24:55
build it in WordPress in the web flow any other web Builder that you enjoy
25:01
plus hosting is going to be $100 per month of course you can also set up
25:06
their own if they don't want to pay the 100 which very rarely does this happen if someone just paid you 4K 5K 6K
25:13
they're happy to pay $100 a month so you can host their website and the benefit of them hosting it with you would be
25:19
that you can always make sure the website's up you can make sure the website doesn't get hacked you can
25:24
update any photos that they need you can update any service Pages as they have more and a lot of times clients are cool
25:32
with this this is what I used to do before high level this was my monthly recurring business it was $100 a month
25:38
just hosting you can also integrate go high level SAS with any custom website that
25:43
you have so what I would do build a custom website use the highle forms use
25:50
the live chat from high level right put it in on that custom website now charge
25:55
them $300 a month now you have a monthly recurring
26:00
client example website I'll show you an example website
26:05
that we have here inside of my sub account so I do see also a question in
26:11
here that I want to tackle we'll do questions later but this this one is just very specific to this point and why
26:18
does goad level not not recommended for high-end custom websites so it is recommended and you definitely could
26:24
build these high-end custom websites inside of high level because they have the WordPress hosting so you can host
26:30
your WordPress websites in here or you can build the high-end websites in here
26:35
right I never said you have to go off of it you can have a website here and just tell your clients hey this is our
26:41
website in a day if they want a bunch of changes and they want to completely redesigned you can take this template
26:47
redesign it and make it custom and add in gifts and add in different
26:53
backgrounds that move and add different things and then charge four grand three grand 5 grand for a website that is
27:00
under this website tab right here that is completely up to you so let me actually show you one of these templates
27:06
that we have now what you're seeing is there's no phone number listed right here because this is a sample uh account
27:13
here as you can see right un able to find form however this is the general outline once you fill out the custom
27:18
values it looks like this it's going to plop in the phone number right here it will put in the email right here it's
27:23
going to put in the address right here across the entire website
27:29
now as you scroll down what you'll need to do obviously is replace the content
27:34
replace the text you can replace certain images we've built these website a day templates for a lot of different niches
27:41
and so for example if you're working with just landscapers you build this website at one time you put in all the
27:47
landscaper content that you have right here right here and you you link up all the different pages and the dropdowns
27:54
and then all you have to do is just replace the logo and then replace a couple photos right like maybe take this photo off and put the photo of a
28:00
business owner there so really should not take much time this is one example of a site as you saw it was built
28:06
completely in high level so you replace all this if you use the custom values it will replace all the social media links
28:13
it will replace everything let me briefly show you how the custom values actually look inside
28:19
here so you can get an idea so here it is right value you're going to put in
28:25
everything in here and it replaces it on the website so with that being said let's go ahead
28:32
and keep on moving all right offer variations so if they don't have a
28:38
website here is again we'll cover Outreach messages and everything in day two but I want to give you a sneak peek
28:44
a preview on what you can actually say hey are you still open I was looking for
28:50
landscapers in Los Vegas but it says closed I actually built you a website
28:56
because I liked some of the photos I found of your business would love to show you let me know if you're free sometime
29:02
tomorrow so this obviously sounds amazing you built them something for
29:08
free so now they have a reason to jump on Zoom with you so you can actually
29:13
show them something we have the existing website so if you get a list of people and they
29:19
have an existing website you can say hey I found something broken on your website are you guys still open question mark I
29:25
actually fixed it for you and rebuilt a couple things do you want to see it let me
29:31
know now you're probably wondering well what if they don't have anything broken the thing is a lot of these business
29:37
owners if they have a custom website designed it's probably not by a niche
29:42
expert meaning they could be a custom web design expert they could build this beautiful website but what we found is a lot of these websites are not optimized
29:50
to actually bring them sales so even though some custom web
29:55
designer charged them thousands of dollars for it and spent a a bunch of time on it doesn't mean that you can't build them a higher converting website
30:04
I've managed so many websites over the years I mean literally at at once we had hundreds of websites that I was managing
30:10
and I saw the metrics I saw the statistics I saw the analytics of who was get who was getting roughly the same
30:16
amount of traffic and who was getting more website form submissions more phone calls than another
30:22
website and I started linking this up in my mind and thinking why is this one doing better and that's how I develop
30:28
these principles when it comes to web design I'm just not seeing much good training
30:33
online right now and that's why now even if if you go to my YouTube a lot of the stuff is around web design because I had
30:41
to figure this I had to figure out all of this on my own and I'm just I'm not seeing this type of training be released
30:49
so yeah exact scripts uh that you can copy and paste will be coming up so one
30:54
thing that I want to mention here so this is the offers page so for everyone
31:00
that does upgrade their existing goad level account or sign up for a new account this is the link that you can
31:07

32:08
you get access to everything I hold nothing back this is the main thing that I do everything that I offer is inside
32:14
of the community so let's keep on question for you for if I'm somebody
32:19
that I'm new to marketing um I'm not really familiar like with masterminds
32:25
with communities with members ship courses but just like working with other people that have done what I want to do
32:33
now they've done it already and kind of receive that from them can you share a
32:38
little bit about when someone joins your community um or your program what that
32:44
what that transition looks like or maybe describe a little bit about what they can maybe expect outside of maybe a
32:50
normal setup or another type of community that may be out there yeah absolutely so what are the main things
32:57
that that we do that has worked very very well for people and for members
33:02
inside of our community and by the way even if you're on the highest level go high level plan there's still ways that
33:08

33:44

33:50
that we have on how to actually get clients we have one slide let's say that
33:56
covers all of them and I'm going to talk about bit about every single method I'll give you a couple different scripts of course but inside there we go in depth
34:03
each video is 20 30 40 minutes into every single one of those bullet points that we have I go very far in depth and
34:09
show you live real examples of how we actually get clients this is the most
34:14
in-depth thing that I have seen on this I've been a part of many different
34:19
coaching programs and mentorships and everything and anyone that sees this my friends that have also paid for coaching
34:25
and mentorship tell me this is like a 51 ,000 program that I'm giving away for free literally if you just upgrade your
34:32
high level or sign up for a new high level account using my link so and for those that may not know you you right as
34:39
as as others may know you um what you said you were part of other coaching programs right what did that do for you
34:46
like when did that when did the light turn on for you and inspire you to Now teach others like when did that
34:52
transition happen yeah so I'm quite passionate about
34:58
coaching programs and mentorships because it's helped me so much you know when I was a web designer again I didn't
35:06
start traveling if if if you look at my story I started my company in 2017 I didn't start traveling until
35:12
2019 and I even when I started traveling I was only making like four or 5,000 a
35:18
month so if you think about it it took me years to even get to a full-time income and actually quit my job and also have some savings because I thought hey
35:24
if I lose a few clients I'm going to have to move back in uh back in in my hometown which is which is in Buffalo
35:30
and I so I hate the snow so I was very motivated to leave and one of the biggest differences is in 2020 is when I
35:36
first started making over $10,000 a month and once I started making over 10K a month I never made less than 10K a
35:42
month again and the biggest shift that I had right why did it take me years to get to a full-time income and then it
35:48
took me 6 months to get to 10K and then in another 6 months I was already at 15 so the exponential growth came from
35:55
coaching came from mentorship came from people that were able to give me feedback and say hey this thing that
36:01
you're doing you should tweak it a bit right you should alter it a bit Hey
36:06
try this offer right hey this sales call isn't going like you expect because of
36:11
this if you look at all the best athletes right Kobe Bryant LeBron James all these people what do they do right
36:18
boxers they rewatch their own tapes they rewatch they replay their performance
36:24
and they critique themselves chess players do this as well they rewatch their games and they think how can I be
36:30
better next time I think in the beginning I was trying to be a solopreneur I think when you're a web
36:35
designer and that's your background you think you you could do everything yourself you think you're the expert and you think you don't need anyone else I'm
36:43
here to make money people pay me because I'm me because I'm the designer and that's fine you can think
36:49
that way but at the end of the day when you actually do get help and when you have feedback and when you have a community and people that are around you
36:56
that you can even meet in person and you meet them and you're inspired by
37:01
them you think in the back of your mind you might even think how does this guy make so much more money than me when
37:07
he's not even that smart right like this and so this this happened to me these people are just like me why are they all
37:13
making more money than me this makes no sense and so you have a glass ceiling growing up I never even knew someone
37:18
that made six figures so of course I'm not going to make six figures of course my cap is going to be 4 5K a month
37:24
because that's what everyone around me makes I don't know anyone that makes makes more money than that and so when I
37:29
started joining these communities these coachings when I started making these friends and masterminds that all made way more money
37:37
than me it started breaking my mental beliefs my mental barriers that I had
37:42
regarding money because we haven't we never had none never had any and I think that really is probably
37:51
one of the most beneficial parts of joining any kind of community of course there's access and trainings and all
37:57
that stuff but that's that's great that's one part of it but also just getting the feedback if you jump on Zoom
38:03
I also do Zoom calls every single week with everyone you can jump on and ask me questions hey this is what I've tried
38:09
for the past three months hey this is what I tried in the past week in the past whatever how can I make it better that's
38:16
how we tweak it that's how we improve Einstein said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a
38:21
different result if that's what you're doing how in the world do you expect to scale and
38:27
actually grow your business yeah I appreciate you you digging a little deep in that because
38:33
you know we get into right the concept we get into the framework we get into the strategy and the mindset so
38:39
important it's so important and I know you got some some some some details here
38:45
that you I didn't mean to hold you up um but but I just feel like for our newer members our newer Community um
38:51
participants new users I level so so much and I'm like where do I start like
38:57
this this guy is great I want to follow him and I'll take take his advice but like I'm lost overall so thank you my
39:04
friend um I'm going to sit back here because uh I know you got some some good nuggets coming up of course man let's do
39:10
it so let's talk about your 20K Evolution so you need to level up who
39:15
you are first before you make any real money in the business it will be a
39:20
reflection of how much you've actually grown improved and how much you've
39:26
reinvested in yourself this could even be books in the beginning I didn't have mentors and courses and this and that nothing like
39:32
this existed when I started in 2017 I had books and that's it if you want to make at the end of the day doctor or
39:39
lawyer level income after a couple years without spending most of your 20s stuck
39:45
in school you have to put in your dues and that's what people don't realize I
39:51
was ready for it to take 10 years for me to make over $10,000 a month
39:57
and I was I was fine with that there's a lot of people that go to school and invest hundreds of thousands of dollars
40:03
and will'll never see the kind of income that you can generate from this business not even to mention by the way the
40:09
freedom right how much do doctors work how much do lawyers work a lot of freaking hours a lot of
40:17
hours you need to take imperfect action do not be a perfectionist so many web
40:22
designers I see it's so common in the web design industry oh because it's a design field oh this needs to look
40:28
perfect and these elements and this and that oh but this is not ready yet and this is oh but this automation isn't set
40:34
up and this workflow isn't that's not how you grow a business
40:41
you grow you take imperfect action and then you adjust as you go it's ready fire aim that is the philosophy you get
40:49
ready you fire you send the messages you go out you do the sales calls you meet the People You Meet the prospects and
40:56
then you adjust and then you do it again and then you do it again and that's how
41:01
it goes take freaking action every day even
41:06
if it's small you have to progress daily it took me far too long because some
41:11
weekends I'd be crazy productive other weekends I'd be out with my friends and
41:16
I'd be doing other things and by the way you don't have to sacrifice your entire life for this right but would it be
41:23
beneficial to go into a monk mode period to where you're just grinding and you're just working
41:28
before work after work weekends I think so if you can grind and work in monk
41:34
mode for a couple years to reclaim the rest of your life and make a full-time income yes the answer is yes that makes
41:42
sense prospecting is King you have to get more appointments at all costs this
41:48
is the biggest thing that you need to focus on in your business how can I actually get more appointments how do I
41:53
test more offers I think a lot of people both in web design and in go high
42:00
level Focus way too much on the tech and I think that's great you you definitely
42:06
want to understand what you're doing and we're going to cover that in day three we'll cover the deliverables how it all
42:11
works but at the end of the day that should not stop you from reaching out you don't have to have everything
42:17
figured out get more appointments get clients sign them up
42:22
and then figure it out as you go you're going to learn way more if you're working on a live client then you will
42:27
if you're just sitting in your room obsessing about a problem that doesn't even
42:34
exist get more appointments at all costs test everything you possibly can and you
42:40
will fail so fail as soon as possible fail ASAP you'll you'll send a
42:45
100 messages three people will respond and they'll tell you they're not interested great change the message keep
42:51
going keep moving anxiety and nervousness is also a good thing if you're doing sales calls and you're
42:57
nervous if you're selling websites if you're charging a price you're not comfortable with that's fine that's what
43:02
growth feels like if you never get uncomfortable and if you never feel a
43:07
little bit of impostor syndrome then that means you're just not grown you're so comfortable that you're
43:13
not doing anything new so think of the gym imagine if you
43:18
go to the gym and you do the exact same workout every single day not even every day a couple times a week right three
43:24
four times a week yes you'll build a little bit of muscle but at some point you just won't grow anymore you won't
43:30
get in better shape you have to progressively overload you have to struggle you have to put on
43:36
more weight that is how you improve so here's my Epiphany that I had
43:43
College $50,000 $100,000 plus investment four years of life most are happy with 4
43:50
to $6,000 a month salary working for 40 hours a week until they die
43:58
investment property 150,000 200,000 investment and most are happy with $900
44:05
a month profit three clients at $300 a month or
44:11
a few custom websites per year does that for
44:18
you right so you don't even need that much I think a lot of people set this goal of I want to make 10,000 I I want
44:25
to make $20,000 a mon month but honestly just making 1,000 a month could be lifechanging I mean that's that could be
44:32
potentially your rent payment your mortgage payment that could be your car payment and this is the ultimate if you
44:38
want to just treat this like a side hustle this also is the ultimate side hustle because the payments keep coming
44:43
in every single month and if you think about how much time people invest into
44:49
these things into college into investments into all of this it's actually pretty insane and we get to do
44:54
that with just our mind we get to create this money basically out of thin air right it's not like we're going in and
45:00
selling a service right we're not making uh a shoe and then selling that shoe right we're not handcrafting things
45:06
we're not building a desk like this one and then selling it we're creating this on the internet with our minds and with
45:12
our effort so the scientific method feedback loop this is what you should follow you
45:18
make an observation you question it you create a hypothesis you experiment you
45:23
form a conclusion you look at the results and then you restart then you ask more questions why
45:30
did I get this outcome this is true for your life this is true for your Outreach this is true for anything that you do
45:36
you make another hypoth hypothesis and then you try again and you keep moving
45:41
and you keep on going forward so what do we actually sell with web design let's dive into this I have another board here
45:49
for you since I see you guys love those and uh so there's two ways go high level SAS $3 to $500 a
45:56
month month then we have advertising Services 1 to 2K per month we're going to cover that here so first one for go
46:03
high level SAS this is what you could sell with web design Google reviews
46:09
right instant results you sign on a client get them a bunch of Google reviews this is a easy and quick win all
46:16
of your website design clients want this why do they have a website so they can
46:21
build their online reputation having a beautiful website without Google reviews will do
46:27
way worse than having a lot of Google reviews but having a simple basic
46:33
website next one database reactivation campaign also instant results if you're
46:39
working with we we'll cover niches here soon but if you're working with a client
46:44
like let's say massage therapy they might see eight people per day if they have multiple masseuses they could see
46:50
15 20 people per day they probably never reach back out to those people imagine
46:56
if you got a list of all their past customers thousands of people maybe even
47:01
tens of thousands of people and you just sent them a text message and email saying hey existing customers get 10%
47:07
off schedule an appointment now you just did that you came into their business
47:12
and now they are crushing it you just instantly in the first week potentially book them 10 20 30 40 appointments on
47:19
their calendar by doing what by running one campaign and the best part is we already
47:25
have this built out so you don't even have to distort this from scratch chat bots so live chat Plus
47:34
Google review responding you add this and this is a huge value ad this could
47:39
potentially replace an employee and by the way all of these things think about
47:45
you want to start thinking about how much value does it actually add to a business owner so how much money would
47:51
you make them if all of a sudden you're getting them all these appointments from a database reactivation how much are
47:56
they making from this probably a large amount right if you if
48:01
you're getting them that many appointments you're making them a lot of freaking money so we work with kitchen and bathroom remodelers and I know that
48:08
one remodeling project is 20 3040 $50,000 I get them 10 appointments they
48:14
close one client I just made them $20,000 in the first week that they worked with
48:20
me next is reputation management so a lot of local business owners forget to ask for Google reviews so if you can
48:27
help them build the habit of using your go high Lev SAS and logging into it every single day and then just marking
48:34
at the end of the day marking everyone that turned into a customer has sold we can automatically send this
48:41
automatically send a review request to their customers without any effort on
48:47
their part tracking everything so local
48:52
business owners really don't track anything right they if you ask them most of them if you ask them where do your
49:00
calls come from they just say online oh they just come from my website or oh
49:06
just online and they don't actually know if you keep digging deeper what do you mean by online you mean Facebook you
49:12
mean Google I mean do they come from postcards do they come from the billboard that I just saw you had up they have no idea so you can even just
49:19
put tracking numbers on different things on if they have a billboard one of my
49:25
best clients was spending over $20,000 000 per month on a billboard and he had no idea how many freaking phone calls are coming from that so I gave him a
49:32
tracking number we put that on the billboard we put one tracking number on his Google ads one on his Facebook ads one on his website and now he can
49:38
actually see what's getting the most amount of phone calls so now he's able to allocate his budget based around
49:44
what's actually getting him results this is extremely valuable Unified Inbox I've
49:50
seen a lot of local business owners that just forget to check their Google my
49:55
business or Google business profile messages they forget to check their Facebook they forget to check their
50:01
Instagram so we're going to basically unify everything get all the messages
50:07
inside of one platform that platform is your wh labeled go high level SAS and
50:12
the best part is they download this on their phone they don't even need to be on a computer and they can look at
50:17
everything answer everything back to back to back to back lead followup a lot of people miss
50:25
their appointments right they get a new lead and they don't respond to them instantly it takes them an hour two hours three hours to even
50:32
respond just by automatically responding or offering missal text back or automatically helping them book
50:37
appointments a new website form comes in maybe that person that you're working with doesn't even want more website
50:43
forms they actually want appointments so what if you can redirect them to a calendar what if you can text them a
50:50
calendar link and just say hey we're so excited to see you here's a calendar link book yourself in I'm excited right
50:58
how much value would that add a lot automated social media posting is also ongoing so they can use AI to
51:05
create content um you can also do this for him there's a couple ways you can structure social media management
51:11
but you can do that inside of your white labeled go high level so I recommend as
51:18
you grow you can get from 0 to 5K a month just with these Services if you'd like my recommendation is as you're
51:25
growing this side of the business also start to learn these services that you can charge 1 to 2K per month for because
51:31
if you get to 5K a month charging 300 a month or $500 a month offering these Services all you have to do as you learn
51:38
these advertising Services is just offer them to your existing clients maybe you already have website design clients that are paying you for hosting or maybe you
51:44
have old website design clients maybe you have SAS clients if you learn these skills right here you can turn that $300
51:49
a month client or $100 a month client into paying you $1,000 a month and
51:55
instantly boost your in like crazy so P before you get into the to more goodies
52:00
here if I am somebody who has taken maybe one of the challenges at high
52:07
level and they talk about the Gateway offer which is maybe the misal text back
52:13
or the the AI uh receptionist if am I understanding this right that the web design as a service
52:21
could be my Gateway offer correct okay so that being my Gateway
52:26
offer let's say I'm somebody that was in sales selling for a larger company
52:32
whether it was advertising software but now I am leaving or I'm preparing to leave that Corporate America job and now
52:40
I want to start my own marketing service provider or a
52:46
Professional Services Company I could use high level this framework if I have
52:52
a passion for web design as my Gateway offer and what you on covered here is basically the expansion offer of how
53:00
it all intertwines with the web design as a service am I tracking with you right that's perfect exactly so web
53:07
design is the foot in the door all of this is after they come in okay and and I know that you know
53:13
folks there's a series of of questions around well I don't know how to design websites I don't know how to fulfill it
53:20
there's resources that are tied into that there's additional trainings but aside from that um when we talk about
53:28
price point of a website whether it's $199 website or a $15,000 website is it
53:35
safe to say based on your experience and what you teach to your community the price varies on the time of the design
53:43
so let's say it's a 150 page website then time and money would would fuel
53:50
what that end price would be would that be one way of of how pricing is determined by time and money 100% time
53:57
that's required okay and then there is another section if I'm understanding this right of like functionality maybe
54:02
there's custom coding there's custom database build out things of that nature
54:08
um that would be another way that it would be maybe a 10 15 $20,000
54:14
website so aside from the time and maybe functionality for the for the average
54:19
business owner or average Professional Services high level does everything they're going to need it's just how much
54:25
do you want to charge per hour is that accurate that's certainly one way that you can do it but I like to get away
54:33
from the per hour structure because I want a scalable
54:40
company and I want to focus mainly on doing Outreach and actually getting more clients so the way that I've always
54:47
charged per custom website is 4 to $6,000 and really this isn't even very
54:55
heavy on the code or super technical the main benefit and the main difference is
55:01
just them wanting to customize it and a lot of times they're cool with paying for that of course there's some clients
55:06
that they're going to want custom code and they want little features and it depends right if you're building like an e-commerce website then of course you
55:13
need more technical stuff and checkouts and this and that but at the end of the day if it's a local business owner if it's a massage therapist if it's a um a
55:21
chiropractor a remodeler a roofer they I mean they don't really care what tech you use use they don't care about any of
55:27
that and you can charge them a high ticket price just because they want something that's custom done they want
55:32
to uh they want you know if they want SEO they need a custom website because they they need all the custom content
55:40
right they need a Content writer and I'm going to show you how to how to Outsource all that and actually have a scalable business around this
55:46
but just customizing everything and making it function and work to what they
55:52
want and then also using your skills and making making sure it converts a lot of the website visitors into paying uh
55:59
customers for your clients is why they're paying you 4 to 6,000 versus the
56:05
the $150 per month and even just like embedding a calendar right so saying hey
56:10
we'll have a automatic booking calendar or we'll have an automated um estimate
56:16
form directly on your website so people can fill out a survey type in let's say
56:21
like how big their lawn is or how many trees they have or this or that and it automatically calculates a price this is
56:26
something we have inside of uh inside of our Landscaping snapshot and just just having these kind of like estimators
56:32
even they're willing to pay more for this yeah and and the reason I just wanted to touch on it because you're
56:39
making it very black and white like this is you can do this and offer this like it's very simple to understand and it's
56:47
very easy for the mind to say well what's the catch or that's not realistic so I wanted to just kind of maybe unpeel
56:53
the onion here and really make show like in detail here how easy this really is
56:58
to implement with all the features that it's already in high level and then the framework and and the you know tutorial
57:04
and the process you're sharing so I appreciate you digging in deep I'm going to throw the mic over back to you of
57:11
course yeah appreciate your your input there so let's dive in so we have the advertising Services first one is going
57:18
to be Facebook you learn Facebook ads a lot of these clients just want new leads this is great after you do the database
57:24
reactivation typically clients are going to okay wow you got us a bunch of appointments we got a bunch of sales what now what's next how else can we get
57:31
customers great well now we've exhausted your list we actually have to do some marketing we have to do some paid
57:37
advertising so we can actually get more leads we can get more potential customers Facebook you can also use
57:44
upack right here if you don't know how to run Facebook campaigns free upack.com
57:49
if you want to use that basically this allows you to run the the Facebook ads right here
57:57
inside of your go high level profile as you can see you have a tab right here manage Facebook ads you click that you
58:03
can launch ads right inside of your go high level account with three clicks I
58:08
think that is amazing so next one is SEO I'm not going to dive too deep into honestly any one of these could be a
58:14
three-day Workshop so we're not going to dive too uh too far in depth into how to provide these services but you have SEO
58:20
which is ranking at the top of Google then we have Google ads of course that's you actually running ads so you appear
58:27
at the top you can also do Google profile ads then we have Google local which is a separate program you can
58:32
Google that and look into that all of these Services you can charge 1 to 2K per month for if you would like to get
58:39
your clients more leads we charge $2,000 per month by the
58:44
way at at this point so those are the additional Services now let's go back into the slides here okay so what do we
58:52
sell with web design we cover that glorified freelancer versus actual business owner or an agency so here's
58:59
what Freelancers do they micromanage everything they never Outsource anything
59:05
if a client asks for another service and they don't offer it they just turn down money and by the way I'm saying this
59:12
not not making fun of web designers by by by any means or Freelancers because I
59:18
did this I'm sharing all of this by the way out of pain out of thinking back and thinking I literally had clients that
59:24
were asking me hey do you do Facebook hey can you help me with my social media posting hey can you help me with this
59:30
can you help me with that and I just said no right like i' I've tried to pitch custom websites and people said hey I
59:36
don't have a budget uh I could just pay for hosting can you just give me something basic and I said no right I
59:42
didn't think I could just copy and paste a website a lot of Freelancers adopt the Craftsman mindset and try to do
59:48
everything themselves the company cannot run without them their income is capped
59:55
to how many hours they actually work they believe they are the best at everything and no one can do what they
1:00:03
do business owners on the other hand they build an agency with a team to
1:00:09
handle different project stages so this could be working with other Freelancers and hiring contractors to do one-off
1:00:16
projects or ongoing projects and here's an example you have an assistant for $4
1:00:21
an hour that sets up different website templates create content with creates
1:00:26
content with chat GPT creates your automations puts together your prospecting list your people of who
1:00:33
you're going to reach out to people that actually need your service people that you need to reach out to
1:00:40
imagine Michael Jordan pumping up basketballs before his games instead of actually practicing and training in his
1:00:48
craft doesn't make sense you want to create a monthly
1:00:53
recurring business so that you don't start from zero every single month like a
1:00:59
freelancer and then you want to have Outsourcing and referral Partners this doesn't always mean that you need to
1:01:05
want that you need to be the one that's delivering these Services you can have referral Partners or you can hire
1:01:13
contractors you can pay them per month per client to actually handle everything
1:01:18
for you making it impossible for you to lose money imagine hiring someone per hour
1:01:26
you get a new client that signs up they only work when you have work you pay them to work per hour imagine if you
1:01:33
have a referral partner that has the SEO skill the Facebook skill the Google ad skill that has all these skills that you
1:01:39
don't maybe have at the moment so as you're growing your business you can charge your clients $11,000 per month
1:01:45
for a service and then Outsource it for $300 per
1:01:50
month you want to adopt a CEO mindset and do what your best stat these
1:01:56
business owners this is what they do you want to Outsource the rest and create systems around everything you want to
1:02:04
create Frameworks and templates that are replicable increasing output without
1:02:10
decreasing your quality by delegating you can actually
1:02:16
take on more clients you can take on larger clients you can deliver better results and faster results making a far
1:02:23
superior experience for your customer customers plus actually demand higher
1:02:29
prices everyone wins you win because you can now grow your business you can scale your company and your clients win
1:02:35
because everything is seam everything is streamlined everything is done quicker and they're getting an amazing service
1:02:42
business owners focus on refining client onboarding project management and delivering
1:02:48
processes so and again we'll cover all the operations and all that stuff in the
1:02:54
future days here and I'm going to cover inth depth where I go to hire these virtual assistants exactly what I
1:03:00
Outsource I'm going to share my assembly line process okay this person is in charge of this then this happens then
1:03:06
this happens and I have checklists for all this stuff that I'm going to be sharing let's talk about niching down
1:03:12
why do we actually pick a niche you want to be able to speak their language become industry experts this allows you
1:03:19
to charge more this allows you to productize your business meaning you can
1:03:24
build it once you can replicate funnels you can replicate websites you can replicate workflows etc for each and
1:03:32
every client if you sign on 10 website in a day clients and there are 10
1:03:37
different niches one's a massage therapist one's a roofer one does Plumbing one is a builder one does
1:03:45
kitchen remodeling one does basement you're all over the place one's a chiropractor one's a doctor one's a
1:03:50
surgeon it's going to be hard for you this will just take too much time and also you're not going to know what's best for them
1:03:56
you're not going to know for example that landscapers actually want booked appointments versus actual just website form submissions or just leads you're
1:04:03
not going to know these things you're going to have to start from scratch for each and every new client and at the end of the day there
1:04:10
is no perfect Niche every Niche has good every Niche has bad play to who you are
1:04:15
and your competitive Advantage right think about your warm Market who is in
1:04:21
your close Circle who are you around is your dad a dentist is your your mom a
1:04:26
massage therapist is your dad a massage therapist think about this right think about who you know do you know anyone
1:04:32
that's in a certain industry it could be a friend it could be a family friend just look at who you're around there's a
1:04:37
lot of business that's in your warm Market that you don't even realize even for example
1:04:43
look at the people that you've recently hired maybe you recently hired someone to fix your garage door maybe that's
1:04:50
someone that you know the owner the owner came and you can call him up right now and say hey what's going on this is so and so and they're likely to take
1:04:57
your phone call because you paid them right and this is something that you want to think about I am notorious for
1:05:04
home services so I work in the kitchen and bath space like I mentioned and I
1:05:11
like the Home Services I've been dealing with contractors I've tested a bunch of
1:05:16
different niches in fact in the beginning my Niche was anyone that would freaking pay me but then I started
1:05:23
niching down and that's when I really started to grow my company and I actually stumbled into Contracting I had
1:05:28
a friend that did tree service so that was one of my first clients for SEO it was just Tree Service I didn't know
1:05:34
anything about the business I learned a lot from him and then I started realizing that a lot of these Home Services they use certain language they
1:05:40
want more jobs they want more estimates and I started understanding what that meant and so as I sign on more clients
1:05:47
and spas and this kind of thing I just realized the clients that got the best results for me were contractors and so
1:05:53
in the beginning the perfect Niche could be just signing up anyone and
1:05:58
everyone so let's keep on moving is the niche data easy to find I'm going to show you how to do this in day two I'm
1:06:04
going to show you how to actually export your Niche and how to find these leads and how to find potential people to reach out to but you want to make sure
1:06:10
that that they're easy to look up is this a recurring service or a one-time service right Roofing versus massage
1:06:17
therapists Roofing obviously is one time your roof is leaking you get it repaired you don't need it again massage therapy
1:06:24
you can get it every day if if you want you want to look at niches that are medium to high ticket or medium to high
1:06:32
volume but ideally a bit of both look at chiropractors look at
1:06:38
dentists right it's a recurring Service uh massage therapist is good and if you
1:06:44
need help with this you can use our sheet to help so I'm going to show you what we have here and this will be
1:06:50
linked I have a bunch of niches here that I exported from Google my business and then I have a couple common niches
1:06:57
here like carpet cleaners you know gyms salons chiropractors all that and then I
1:07:02
also in the very bottom here I listed the niches by the lead price so you can
1:07:08
actually go into here and these are exported and you can look at how much each Niche right here this is in home
1:07:15
service how much they're paying per lead so as you can see right cabinets they're
1:07:20
paying $32 per lead but to build custom cabinets it's $52 per lead
1:07:26
and so this will give you great feedback on any Niche that you want to go after concrete right junk removal anything
1:07:35
that you could be wanting to get into so let's keep going you have to understand
1:07:41
your Niche you start to pick up on their way of speaking this is what's actually going to help you convert more leads
1:07:49
into customers and anything else these people feel like you understand them and you actually use the words that they use
1:07:54
like I mentioned estimates appointments jobs this kind of thing you want to
1:08:00
learn what their most profitable Services is so for example Roofing not everyone does metal roofs but metal
1:08:07
roofs are very very expensive and you want to find out do they like shingle roofs right what do they actually want
1:08:12
more leads in dentists not all D again not every single business prefers these
1:08:19
kinds of clients but you want to know what they charge High ticket for for dentists this is implants right very
1:08:24
expensive concrete asphalt paving or foundation work very expensive electricians generator installation you
1:08:31
could look a lot of this stuff up inside of the spreadsheet that I also
1:08:37
mentioned next keep tweaking your messaging until you find something that actually gets replies and gets you
1:08:44
customers so what I've learned is that in Home Services if you talk
1:08:49
unprofessionally and if you have spelling mistakes you ironically just get higher open rates and direct
1:08:55
language does better if you're very direct that's how these guys communicate that is how these guys talk and when we
1:09:03
go over my live sales calls and my live sales Outreach and my live sales uh actual meetings of Me closing clients
1:09:09
you'll see I'm very unprofessional and I'm very laid-back you you're not going
1:09:14
to wear a full suit if you're meeting with a home service contractor but maybe
1:09:19
if I'm talking to a surgeon it would be different another way that you can
1:09:25
research is go to Amazon you can find books related to that field read skim them read the comments read what people
1:09:31
say so for example type in like landscaper marketing and sometimes this
1:09:36
is done by a retired landscaper or retired business owner that now does coaching or something like that or even
1:09:43
sometimes it's it's it's made by other marketing companies but there's still good data in those books so use Google
1:09:48
and uh also Facebook ads manager to find other people that are targeting that Niche and look at their language and look at what they are saying so let's
1:09:55
talk about setting up your agency brand first thing you want to do is set up your website so we do have a template
1:10:04
that you can take a look at right here inside of this spreadsheet this is our best agency tools spreadsheet and I will
1:10:10
be sharing this again all the resources guys will be here this is a preview of the
1:10:15
website the import link is right here so agency funnel import link and this is
1:10:22
what it roughly looks like again it's all Lauren mson uh we do give this fully customized and
1:10:28
fully built out for anyone that signs up with our uh link to high level this is completely done so you actually don't have to write any content it's all done
1:10:35
but this is your portfolio this is where you can show your sample websites and and all that stuff so when you build
1:10:41
your web design portfolio on your domain uh you want to link it to your website and you want to have case studies this
1:10:47
is one of the best things that you can actually do I like to use name cheep for domains I already know someone's going
1:10:52
to ask what do you recommend for domains name cheps what I use I'll show you how to actually purchase the domain and Link
1:10:58
it up to your websites and to your funnels the first thing you want to do is go over to name cheep you can use any
1:11:05
platform you want realistically but I just like name cheep it's cheap it has free privacy so it just works so go
1:11:11
ahead and type in your agency domain right here you could type in. com.net dog anything you want just as a sample I
1:11:20
ended up purchasing this one right here.org and it's going to look like this what you want to do is go over
1:11:27
inside of your go high level dashboard you can hit settings right here and then you can hit domains right here and what
1:11:33
it's going to do is it's going to give you a field so let's say I want to add this one inside of the account boom I
1:11:41
keep always keep this checked off then I hit continue it's a setting up your domain and it's going to give us values
1:11:48
that we can put in under the advanced DNS so go ahead and click here and again I'm moving very quickly here but if you
1:11:54
just follow along exactly what I'm doing he'll be just fine so there's that okay
1:12:01
here are the records so the host is a so all you're going to do is go in here you're going to type in the a record
1:12:07
host is going to be this and then under IP okay let's copy that and then we're
1:12:12
going to paste it in here boom I always do change it to five minutes here you can hit publish save changes and let's
1:12:20
do the next one next one is www so let's do that right we have the C
1:12:26
name www paste and there it is change that to 5
1:12:34
minutes or 1 minute actually even better so boom now you are all good I'm going to change this to 1 minute because that
1:12:41
means it's going to be done faster and now when you go back over to your
1:12:47
platform to your go high level platform you're going to hit verify record sometimes this takes a little bit of time sometimes this is instant but what
1:12:54
this will allow you to do is use this on your websites on your funnels on everything and look this is the same way
1:13:01
that you're going to link up your client's websites and this is also the same way that you're going to link up different subdomains right so imagine if
1:13:09
you want to do a demo website you can just add a subdomain before this meaning
1:13:14
client's name dot your company name FMP OB say not my company name but you get
1:13:21
the point go in here there it is yay domain was added successfully so we are
1:13:26
all good there it is inside now I can go under funnels or websites or anything and it's completely linked go here go
1:13:34
under where it says settings domains boom you can select anything you want now you can hit save and then it will be
1:13:41
live on the domain also it'll be live under websites and by the way per sub
1:13:47
account inside of here you can have unlimited websites you can have as many websites as you want as many domains as
1:13:54
you want and you can link them all up now what I suggest is you get a new sub account right a new drop down here for
1:14:01
every single client this will allow you to set up the automations and everything else but if you're just starting from zero you could be on any plan here and
1:14:09
have as many websites as you'd like there it is domain go under settings hit save and now that website is live very
1:14:17
very easy next thing you might be wondering is how do we link up emails both for my company and also for our
1:14:23
clients so if you go under settings here there's going to be an email field right
1:14:29
here where it says email Services now after you click that it will actually
1:14:35
ask you to create a dedicated domain and that's exactly what you're going to do so you're going to type this in right
1:14:41
here let's say we want to call it what they recommend which is lc. our domain so let's type that in
1:14:50
boom just like that and you want to hit add and verify Now what is it's going to
1:14:55
do is it's going to ask you connect your domain connect your subdomain right and I'm going to choose ad record manually
1:15:01
right here and all you're going to do is just copy and paste everything the same way that you saw right this record is a
1:15:08
txt all I'm going to do is go in here right so pick txt very easy right and you're just going to take it copy and
1:15:14
paste everything over to here and then everything is going to be set up once you hit verify now what is the benefit
1:15:20
of this the benefit of doing it this way is when you go over to conversations this will allow you to email people okay
1:15:28
from your agency account from your agency domain this could be your name right John fmpd do.org you're able to do
1:15:36
all that within this conversations tab within this conversation dashboard right here you hit create new message you can
1:15:41
select the contact we don't have one but once you select that you'll be able to write any email you want from this new
1:15:48
email that you just purchased and you can manage everything inside the conversations tab so it keeps everything
1:15:55
everything nice clean and easy to view uh make the website Niche specific talking to that industry so should be
1:16:03
very very specific and if it's kind of broad that's okay you can even say something like Home Services if you want
1:16:10
to bring on more people all right let's go into pricing and payments so we use
1:16:16
stripe for billing and another one is PayPal and by the way this is we use go high level for
1:16:23
the invoicing and for sending out the bills for collecting reoccurring payments right here Auto billing
1:16:31
everything at the end of the day though it doesn't really matter we were collecting cash in the in the beginning
1:16:37
I would drive the clients to their their like literally their physical location and they would pay me the the way we
1:16:43
used to charge for custom websites is they would pay half up front half upon completion they would pay me in cash
1:16:49
they would pay me in cash at the very end I'd go to their office we would sit down we would do a meeting I would have my laptop I would turn my laptop show
1:16:56
them what we built we did nothing on Zoom this is in 2017 2018 all that now
1:17:01
it's easier now it's much easier before we begin we do have a few things that we must cover the first thing that I want
1:17:09
to do is talk a bit about learning okay learning equals being in the same
1:17:16
circumstance but your behavior has changed I first heard this quote by her MOSI and I absolutely loved it so for
1:17:25
example if you're going through this training and storing information in your brain but you do not act on any of the
1:17:33
any of the information then you have learned nothing if you have knowledge in your
1:17:40
head but in 6 months nothing has actually changed in your life then you
1:17:45
have learned nothing and the reason I'm saying this is because we're going to cover a lot of stuff here today guys okay we're going to cover Outreach
1:17:52
messages and scripts and how to download lead list and all the stuff that John just mentioned however if you don't take
1:17:59
action on any of it your life just will not change even though you know this information even though you know the
1:18:04
different angles that we're going to have your life will not change unless you actually do something about
1:18:12
it before we begin you want to have your niche in mind as we go through the exercises now it's okay if you don't
1:18:18
have that yet we covered niches yesterday if you don't have one yet just think of one that you reson with it
1:18:25
doesn't have to be perfect you can change it later on but right now just have one in mind it'll be easier as I go
1:18:30
through the different exercises as I give you samples as I give you different templates it'll be easier for you to
1:18:36
have one in mind if you don't have one in mind pick something in Home Services pick something like Landscaping I'm
1:18:42
going to be using Landscaping a lot in these examples so as a default just pick something in home services and then it
1:18:48
will be up to you and you can always switch it later so let's go ahead and keep on moving
1:18:55
I want you to remember why you are doing this because we're going to cover some
1:19:00
of the rejection that you might face and just in general some of the hardships that also will come with this the
1:19:07
Outreach messages that we have do make sense but you also will get rejected and that is normal and we're going to talk
1:19:13
about that but I have found that in those days
1:19:19
where you're getting a lot of NOS maybe you're even trying to send a bunch of
1:19:24
different emails you're trying this strategy or that strategy and nothing is working I want you to remember your why
1:19:30
I shared mine yesterday I told you about my family I was very transparent I told
1:19:37
you about my mom what motivated me where I come from and I want you to visualize
1:19:44
potentially if you're like me and you're doing this because of another person I want you to visualize that
1:19:51
person and I want you not just to do this for yourself but to
1:19:57
visualize looking that person in the eyes and asking them where they could go
1:20:04
in the world if they were financially free if they could travel anywhere they wanted if they could do anything they
1:20:10
wanted to do what would they do and maybe this isn't and maybe this is even an exercise that you can do in
1:20:16
person maybe you can even ask this person and this is something that I did
1:20:23
I want to know where my mom wanted to tr Trav to or she wanted to go just in general what does she want to do and I
1:20:29
want you to use that in the back of your mind as fuel as motivation as something that you can
1:20:37
Circle back to when times get tough so let's dive in what is the goal
1:20:44
of building prospecting lists the goal is to get a list of potential customers that you can
1:20:49
actually reach out to the old way is to find a business and then just just reach out and I used to do this I would go to
1:20:56
Google and I would just type in landscapers near me roofers near me plumbers near me I would type in these
1:21:03
different Search terms or maybe I would even see a truck right so I'm driving in a road I'm sitting in traffic and I see
1:21:08
a car that drives by and it's a plumber or it's a tree service company and I would actually even take a photo of it I
1:21:15
would do a bunch of research on this company I would find out how many reviews they have I'd look at their website I would do all this due
1:21:20
diligence and then I would try to reach out to them and then they would just say no or they would just go post me or they would ignore
1:21:26
me this is a very old way of doing things and this takes a lot of time it takes a lot of time investment I'm going
1:21:33
to show you how you can customize emails and messages and DMS and scripts in bulk
1:21:38
that's going to be the first part of today's training the new way is to gather a spreadsheet of people that you can contact and then reach out to all of
1:21:47
them I'll show you how to place an offer in front of them and actually set an appointment the goal is not to sell them
1:21:53
a website yet this is very important because a lot of people when they first reach out they immediately try to sell
1:21:59
their service hey your website this and that and that don't sell your main service you want to sell the meeting and
1:22:06
you want to sell the value that they're going to get you want to sell the value that
1:22:11
they're going to get on the meeting that they have with you when they jump on Zoom it should not
1:22:19
feel and we're going to go over the sales process and and and everything here but when they jump on zoom and when
1:22:25
you're actually going to present what it is that you have you want to make sure that they are getting value and they see
1:22:32
this as a very valuable call almost like a like a consultation it they should walk away
1:22:38
from that sales meeting that Zoom meeting like they paid for it they should feel like they got a steal by getting it for free so here's the
1:22:45
information that we want we want names we want emails we want phone numbers we
1:22:51
want the address City social media Pages Facebook pages Instagram LinkedIn a
1:22:58
website link or lack of a website link meaning they don't have a website Google
1:23:03
Business status Google review count and rating or Facebook or Google pixel installed or
1:23:09
not so here's how we use this information you will use this information to craft customized messages
1:23:15
at scale this is roughly how it's going to work you're going to see and again I'm going to show you what tools I like
1:23:20
to use and where we actually get get this data but this is the bare minimum of what want as you can see some people
1:23:26
don't even have their Google Business verified it's just false right here right say false right here so imagine if
1:23:33
you had this list and you categorized it by people that don't have their Google Business verified right so you hit right
1:23:41
here and you sort it by people that say false and you just reach out to
1:23:46
them and you even pull their reviews and they're rating into that message How likely are they to respond much more
1:23:53
likely than having some some generic copy and paste message you want to pull the reviews and then even you want to
1:23:58
know whether they have a Facebook pixel or a Google pixel I'm going to show you what this looks like live as well this is that same
1:24:05
spreadsheet and this is all here and you can categorize right here by the site by
1:24:10
the website a lot of people a lot of people have asked me how do you actually find the people that don't have a website well this is how I would do it I
1:24:17
would generate a list I would categorize it now look we have all these people that have websites and then you scroll
1:24:22
down and there's a list of businesses that don't have websites but you still have a bunch of information about them
1:24:29
like phone numbers I didn't include the phone number in here cuz I mean these are these are random businesses but as
1:24:34
you scroll we do have a bunch of a bunch of information to the right of the screen and as you generate this list you
1:24:40
will also have that so let me give you the first
1:24:46
example here what sounds more convincing version one hey name so hey
1:24:54
Bob I saw your website online and thought you could use some improvements it seems your metadata is not configured
1:25:01
correctly and your page speed is 13.2 seconds which is above average also when viewing your site on mobile I noticed
1:25:08
there was an indexing issue and the menu buttons aren't functioning properly we are a high-end web design firm that does
1:25:14
in-depth analysis of business owners like yourself we fix all issues for a reasonable cost I'm bored just reading
1:25:19
this we would love to build you a brand new website for no cost and you can pay only after you like it uh please let me
1:25:26
know if this is something that you are interested in I have clients that forward me messages like this and I see these
1:25:35
and I it seems that people don't alter their messages because there's a lot that all sound like this so this is
1:25:42
version one compare that to version two is this business owner's name or
1:25:48
just the business name it depends typically when you have a lead list you want one or the other is this
1:25:54
ABC Landscaping was looking for a landscaper in blank city in Las Vegas
1:26:00
just looked you up online ABC Landscaping Las Vegas but couldn't tell if you were open loved your photos and
1:26:06
the fact that you have X reviews right loved the fact that you have five reviews or 55 reviews but the website
1:26:12
looked messed up thought I'd build you a new one for free maybe you like it better plus get more estimates question mark anyways let me know if you want to
1:26:18
see it the first draft is already done if not no worries I can throw it away
1:26:23
let me know so the first thing that I'm going
1:26:28
to say is if there's any English teachers on here they probably hate me because the grammar is absolutely terrible and
1:26:37
that's okay from doing a bunch of different AB testing I have tested using
1:26:42
Correct punctuation you'll notice the W's lowercase all of this stuff is on
1:26:48
purpose I have just found that when my email sounded like this when they looked
1:26:53
like this just organic like you're writing to a friend or to a family member a cousin anyone it just got
1:27:01
higher respon rints people just resonated more with a message that is
1:27:06
like this and we're going to go more into the examples and everything that's just the
1:27:12
general philosophy and two examples yep p before you you start getting into into
1:27:17
the into what everyone is anticipating here to be the meats and potatoes of bringing this script to life right and
1:27:23
and really feeding feeding the prospecting machine um two questions for
1:27:28
you well could you help me understand how today do you really find like good
1:27:35
messaging like there's so many different ways of you know approaches whether it's through the DM through email through
1:27:41
phone call um without sounding salesy and cheesy what do you typically do or
1:27:48
do you coach on on others you know that you work with on how to create a personality for themselves you know
1:27:54
that's that that everyday personality in business yeah so I think the the first
1:28:00
part of your question is how do you know what channels you should use to actually reach out to people and I think the channels are different depending on the
1:28:07
industry for example if you're working with a dentist or a plastic surgeon or
1:28:12
someone that is more sophisticated perhaps you don't want it to be this laidback if you're working with a home
1:28:19
service contractor a roofer a plumber if you show up on Zoom with a full suit and
1:28:25
you give them these in-depth analysis they're just they're not going to understand they're going to sit there
1:28:31
quietly and they're just going to hang up or if you try to cold call them they're just going to hang up and yeah at the end of the day you
1:28:39
have to understand uh what your Niche is what your space in what your space is in
1:28:44
and what people react to and what they respond to well for example I used to
1:28:50
think that my industry of remodeling kitchen remodeling bathroom remodeling they hang out on LinkedIn right what
1:28:56
rofer do you know is using LinkedIn on his phone and all this and for a while I didn't send any messages on LinkedIn we
1:29:02
would use Instagram we would use Facebook my industry they hang out in Facebook groups um some are on Instagram
1:29:10
but then I started testing LinkedIn and what I realized was the bigger companies do hang out on LinkedIn the average
1:29:17
roofer doesn't hang out on LinkedIn but the person that's qualified that's making multiple seven figures a year and
1:29:22
his roofing business and his business and his landscaping business they do use LinkedIn they understand the power of
1:29:29
it and so I would suggest if you are starting and you don't know exactly which channels they hang out with they
1:29:34
hang out on just test all of them and I'm going to show you how you can test all of them in bulk like at the end of
1:29:40
the day you already have the spreadsheet that we just covered here
1:29:46
and you're going to have as you can see their Facebook profile you're going to have their LinkedIn you're going to have
1:29:51
their Instagram you're going to right there LinkedIn not every single person but you'll have a bunch of their social medias you might
1:29:58
as well test it and try to reach out on all channels and then like I mentioned
1:30:04
in yesterday's call use the scientific method make a hypothesis send the
1:30:09
messages see the results and then make a new hypothesis and keep going that is what I recommend you do
1:30:17
some niches email campaigns are going to work some niches you'll find it better on Instagram Facebook up to you
1:30:24
that brings a lot of clarity thank you for that and then like like this you know this paragraph or this six seven lines of content um like if it's a
1:30:32
Facebook Messenger is it best to go longtail direct message or do you open
1:30:38
up the conversation with like a hey like there's so many different ways right so there's no one cookie cutter away but
1:30:43
like I'll get DMS and sometimes I'll have like a good sentence and a half hey look I'm reaching out because of this
1:30:50
this and this would you be open to talk some resonate some don't and then I've also seen others where they like they
1:30:56
get right to the the whole menu and they just throw it at me and I'm like I'm not even reading this and I move on what is
1:31:03
like a good approach is it the long game where you're sending a few messages liking comments and building upon it or
1:31:09
is it you know just kind of sending a short paragraph and see who bites back yes that's a great question the way that
1:31:16
I would do DMS is I would send it I would not send a huge bulk message right in the
1:31:22
beginning I would would go with the first message is this blank name was
1:31:28
looking for a landscaper in Las Vegas let's say is this ABC Landscaping was looking for a landscaping for a
1:31:34
landscaper in Las Vegas right you can also tie that up
1:31:40
with that this second line just looked you up online blank right uh if you're messaging them on Instagram don't send
1:31:46
them their own Instagram link but send them the website URL but couldn't tell if you were open let them respond first
1:31:52
start the conversation first and you can have virtual assistance and we're going to talk about Outsourcing and and hiring
1:31:58
people to do all of this for you and starting conversations for you as well so you can just pick up on the ones that
1:32:03
are interested in book calls with them but that's essentially how I recommend you start and then you can go in and say the
1:32:10
rest of this message but I would not do it in one bulk message I've made that mistake that's why I'm asking right and
1:32:17
and I I've went out you know just right you get in Desperate mode you're like I'm just going to message 15 people
1:32:23
because they say 15 messages a day and it's the numbers game and then I'm messaging on LinkedIn on Instagram and
1:32:29
then I'm doing email blast so it's very overwhelming for someone that is one experienced that's like this is
1:32:35
different than what I do now and then someone who's brand new who's like I don't know what to do and you don't want their account to get suspended or maybe
1:32:41
you know do it in a way that offends people or makes them upset so thank you for jumping into that with Clarity
1:32:49
amazing let's do this so how do you actually build this Prospect list well
1:32:55
there's a bunch of free tools here there's Chrome plugins there's bunch of
1:33:00
other ones some of my favorites are gmaps free.com we have instant data scraper
1:33:05
this one also is a chrome plug-in that you can install you just go to Google business and then you can hit export and
1:33:11
it'll export everyone that you're looking at on your screen and again all tools will be inside of our best agency
1:33:17
tools spreadsheet at the end so don't worry too much about researching this and typing this in right now they're all
1:33:22
going to be there at the end so no worries paid tools outs scraper this one
1:33:28
is my favorite outc scraper is the one that I use for all types of prospecting
1:33:35
whether I'm selling websites or SAS or paid ads or really anything because as
1:33:41
you can see it gives you all the data that you need so if you want to go in
1:33:47
and pull in their reviews or pull in uh anything else that they might have how
1:33:53
many five star rating uh they have right what's what people are saying you can
1:33:59
even pull that in here and you can have virtual assistant go in and alter this data as well so for example something
1:34:05
that we used to do is we have the reviews link right here and what I would have what I would do is I would have a
1:34:12
virtual assistant go in and click on this link and just put the name of the person that left the most the most
1:34:19
recent review and then in my emails in my DMs I would would reach out and I
1:34:24
would say hey ABC Landscaping I just saw that blank name left you a review
1:34:30
awesome job boom now I could continue so now when they open that it seems super personalized super customized and all
1:34:37
you do is send this to a virtual assistant and say hey just click on this link and put in the name of the latest
1:34:43
person that has left a review so that is one example okay how to build prospecting list part two you want to
1:34:50
focus on segmenting people that you reach out to you can use the data scraper Chrome plugins that I mentioned
1:34:55
before you can use outs scraper or you can use the highle tool completely up to you but there's other platforms that you
1:35:02
can use and this is going to be not for every single industry however Groupon
1:35:08
works for a whole bunch of different niches and industries and categories and I was actually going to show an example
1:35:14
but Groupon is down today so I can't but if you go to Groupon and you go under
1:35:19
the local business category there are contractors on on there there are massage therapists on there and these
1:35:25
are people that are actively looking to sign clients and they're actively giving discounts so if you approached a massage
1:35:32
therapist that's giving 15% off you can approach them and by the way Groupon takes a hefty percentage of the people
1:35:39
that actually pay them as well what you can do is reach out to those business owners and they have their their their
1:35:45
business name in there all you have to do is go to Google and then just Google them and you'll find their phone number
1:35:50
you'll find their website you'll find their email reach out to them and if you're selling websites and they don't have
1:35:56
that offer on the website tell them you can update their website tell them you can add different things tell them you
1:36:01
can add a website online scheduler you can add an calendar that links to their website form you can add a live chat
1:36:08
that's going to redirect to the calendar they can actually get more booked appointments because these people are paying to get more
1:36:15
customers and not only that but if they're offering discounts a it's a great lead for ads if you offer ads but
1:36:23
it's also a great lead for just database reactivation right get a list of their
1:36:28
past customers and that same offer that they're already offering ask them hey
1:36:33
have you sent an email blast have you sent an SMS blast to all your past customers how big is that list 10,000
1:36:41
people 11,000 people go in send that blast to all those people with that same offer and
1:36:47
they're going to get more appointments than they know what to do with it's a great place to find people and also when you reach out you can even say when you
1:36:54
segment it and you find a bunch of businesses on Groupon you can say that in your email hey is this business owner
1:37:00
or is this ABC Landscaping just saw you had a discount on Groupon right and now
1:37:07
you can and now when you scrape all of Groupon you can use that message for all for everyone for all of the businesses
1:37:13
Angie's List so this is specific to like contractors and Home Services you can go on and there are people that are paying
1:37:19
for leads that are using this website and so this is good because these are people that are hungry for more business
1:37:26
and they want they're actively overpaying for leads that are also being shared with a bunch of other contractors
1:37:33
then of course you have Yelp and there's a ton of different websites I'm not going to list all of them but then there's Yelp and all these other ones
1:37:38
and people are paying for ads on Yelp obviously they need more business right you can even look at Google ads and all
1:37:44
this other stuff and you can segment that hey is this blank I saw you on Yelp
1:37:50
right now you can reach out to all those people you can also build a list based
1:37:56
around if you're targeting local now this is actually how I started all of my clients now like I mentioned previously
1:38:03
my Niche was anyone that would pay me but more specifically my Niche was my city that I lived in I met everyone in
1:38:09
person in the beginning and I'll tell you one thing if you get a noow on Zoom it's much better than getting a no- show
1:38:15
in real life when you're sitting in traffic driving through snow that's for
1:38:20
sure and if you're targeting local this is amazing because you can say hey is this
1:38:27
blank would love to sit down get coffee maybe don't lead with that but you can have that later on in your
1:38:33
messaging and instead of having a call to action let's book in a zoom call you can have a call to action that says hey
1:38:39
let's sit down and grab coffee let's meet at the Starbucks on this corner and so forth and they'll be way more open
1:38:46
because again who are you competing with you're competing with people that are targeting an entire city if you're in Las Vegas and I'm not and I'm sending my
1:38:53
lasas Vegas messages and you're at the end of yours you're saying hey let's meet here for coffee that business owner
1:38:58
a lot of these local business owners are much more traditional they like the handshake deal in fact they're willing
1:39:04
to spend more if they could just shake your hand and I've sold websites like this when I was doing it in person I
1:39:10
would join these like BNI groups and Chamber of Commerce and this and that and I would just shake hands and people would tell me that they got they're
1:39:16
getting cheaper quotes over email and online and from people that are overseas
1:39:22
and instead of moving forward with them they would much rather pay me the $4 or $5,000 a month now that's not to say
1:39:29
that you can't charge those prices and work with people all over by the way I'm currently in Colombia and I'm signing
1:39:35
clients in the US right with my Us number and everything us so you can be
1:39:41
remote if you want but use whatever you can as your superpower use whatever you can to your
1:39:47
advantage if you're local start to find clients locally so let's keep moving Chamber of Commerce director so all US
1:39:54
cities so again what you can actually do is you can segment it by even chamber
1:40:01
Commerce hey business owner I saw that you were in the Chamber of Commerce or
1:40:07
hey business owner are you part of blank Chamber of Commerce Las Vegas Chamber of
1:40:12
Commerce and so this is a good resource that you can go in and you can click on uh anyone right so choose a city you
1:40:18
could go into this one uh greater New York anyone you can you can research
1:40:24
this yourself and ask if they're a part of it because now that's very specific right and no one else is saying that everyone is copying and pasting these
1:40:30
messages and you're asking a question hey are you part of this anyways I found something broken so that's another idea for
1:40:38
you now after you generate this list using any one of these methods you can
1:40:43
automatically generate it you can use his Chrome plugins you can even hire someone on Fiverr and tell them hey I need all the businesses from Groupon on
1:40:50
X and they'll do it for you but now you you actually have to clean them you have to clean this list because not every
1:40:58
single email is going to be valid not every phone number is going to be valid and that's okay that's why we use Fiverr
1:41:04
uh we use neverbounce and then also for phone numbers we use clearout phone. you have to just make sure before
1:41:10
you start sending anything that these are actual um these are actual numbers
1:41:15
actual emails here's an example you can go on F type an email verification bunch of people here go through just find
1:41:22
someone that High reviews scroll through there's a bunch not expensive 20 bucks get your list verified it will also save
1:41:29
your uh your your email sender from being all Spam P if I could jump in here
1:41:36
really quick because you know everyone's at a different level when they're working with us at high level whether they're on the $97 plan 297 or $497 and
1:41:44
their knowledge and their experience as a whole for someone that has not yet set
1:41:50
up their maybe their lead connector email or their mail gun or their
1:41:56
SMTP um if they connect their Google Gmail or their Outlook Gmail into high
1:42:03
level um and they're starting out message one by one by one um is that
1:42:09
still okay to start to get going like if you're at that level like you have to
1:42:15
have the fancy stuff and I think I know the answer but I just want to put it out there to make sure that everyone understands that you know what are your
1:42:22
thoughts on that yeah so yes your question is can you do it one by one instead of doing everything in
1:42:28
bulk yeah and and really studying everything for hours and reading manuals and Analysis paralysis by analysis right
1:42:36
just you said it before like just do it yeah 100% just do it at the end of the
1:42:42
day you don't need any fancy tools right like the one that I gave you of outs
1:42:47
scraper I would honestly you don't need any tools all you need is outs scraper that's the main one or just use the tool
1:42:52
inside of level you're already on High level just use that one and just reach out to people one by one then if you
1:42:58
want right open up all their Facebook pages like this right you have them in a
1:43:04
spreadsheet open them up in new tabs and just start sending messages like you don't need funds you don't need virtual
1:43:09
assistance you don't need all of this you can start by sending 20 50 we'll go over the volume here in a second but you
1:43:16
can absolutely do all this yourself just make sure that you're doing enough volume right don't send five messages and then come back and say you know
1:43:23
it just doesn't work this model that pav taught and you know this this Workshop just something doesn't work I've sent
1:43:29
five messages no one responded and actually one person said they're not interested it's broken doesn't work
1:43:35
right and and I I'll share experience when I was first getting started out and these are stories I hear also um you
1:43:41
know the email deliverability the the warming up all these different uh
1:43:46
processes you know if you're sending out authentic personalized emails from high
1:43:52
level and you turn off the email validator and have your you know method of payment in there um that's a start
1:43:59
but you want to I'm assuming personalize kind emails and then you could scale as
1:44:05
you go with what messaging and N you're working with do you coign that would you
1:44:11
am I align with what you're teaching yes correct and and and honestly even if you don't want to go that far and you want
1:44:16
to keep it really simple just make another Gmail and just just send it from the Gmail like I it's not really about
1:44:22
all these fancy tools it's just about taking action just make a just they get
1:44:27
tied up I don't want I don't know what to do and they watching this yeah get yeah and I'll I'll go over
1:44:33
some some tools that are Advanced that you can send 50 100 500 emails per day
1:44:38
but at the end of the day you can just make a Gmail don't send it right away
1:44:43
and just use it subscribe to a couple things and just use that Gmail for sending you
1:44:50
know just send 20 a day yourself and then slowly build it up to 30 a day and 40 a day and so forth and we'll go over
1:44:58
the numbers here in a second so let's go ahead and keep on moving so organic prospecting warnings if you don't want
1:45:05
to invest money you have to invest time volume is King and this goes along
1:45:12
nicely with what we just talked about because if you don't have money you can't pay for these Advanced tools to send 100 emails 500 emails a day then
1:45:19
you just have to invest your time you have to make that Gmail and just send it manually just send it yourself you have
1:45:24
to open up all the all the Facebook links and the Instagram links in a new tab so you have 50 tabs open you know to
1:45:31
the point where all you see is the icon you can't even see what tab is open and then you have to click into it and maybe
1:45:36
copy and paste a couple messages um you know and then just input their name or
1:45:42
input their city and so forth so sometimes that's what you have to do in the beginning each person situation is
1:45:47
different but volume is King no matter what you have to do enough perfect script don't exist you
1:45:54
have to test you have to test test test and you have to keep on testing even once you're done testing everything is a
1:46:01
testing as a marketer you should always be testing new angles new scripts this
1:46:06
is how you get better you are effectively a scientist
1:46:12
like we talked about yesterday the scientific method even once you get something that works that's getting you
1:46:17
paying clients I want you to sit and still test that message and try to find something
1:46:23
that works better sometimes it'll work worse but keep trying to find something that's
1:46:29
better and better and better and you're always testing so let's keep moving follow-up
1:46:35
here is king So we have email you can follow up on email and I'm going to show
1:46:41
you how to tie this all together here we have SMS we have voicemail drops you
1:46:46
have DMS and more and then you can use free phantombuster
1:46:53
with their social media I'll show you briefly what this looks like as well and this kind of ties it all together so
1:47:00
what I like to do is if you're going to reach out to them on email or DMS or
1:47:05
anything again using the same list so we're talking about this list find the people that say that have Instagram and
1:47:12
you're going to import the same list this is how we get maximum return on investment you import it to a tool like
1:47:18
this and then it will automatically comment on their Instagram it'll automatically follow them it'll
1:47:24
automatically like their posts right and you can use something like this to even
1:47:31
like their stories like right there story Auto Watcher so you don't have to sit there on on on your Instagram it
1:47:37
will automatically watch that story and heart their stories so now you are reaching out to them on every
1:47:45
channel that is imaginable and this is that omnipresent approach of course if
1:47:50
someone says they're not interested don't bombard them you don't want to spam people don't don't do any of that
1:47:56
but imagine if you called them they didn't answer and then you automatically left them a voicemail then you
1:48:02
automatically texted them hey I just tried to call you I wasn't able to then you also emailed them and you also sent
1:48:08
them a DM on Instagram and then you also started watching all their stories and then you like their post and then you commented on their post on Instagram now
1:48:15
what if you did that on linked in as well would they be way more likely to
1:48:20
respond to your messages if you have a good offer if you have a good message again if they say no then just remove
1:48:26
them from your list and don't reach out to them so let's keep going so I'm going to give you the biggest
1:48:31
hack if you do this one hack all of your Outreach will be multiplied I want you to call everyone
1:48:40
that responds with anything other than not interested or no or stop emailing me
1:48:47
or texting me or don't call me everyone that shows even a little bit of Interest
1:48:53
I want you to call them and I know for some people that might scare you but look at the end of
1:48:59
the day calling people is not that scary right you're dealing with business owners they're on the phone all the time
1:49:07
they had to face their fears right they went 200k 100K in debt they had to rent
1:49:12
out all this equipment and they had to hire staff and this and that and they're paying payroll taxes and this and that
1:49:18
like we don't have all that stuff in this business all we have to do is face our fears so what I want you to do when someone
1:49:25
responds positively is to call them and I'm going to go over the script and what to say and everything once we go over
1:49:30
the intro calls but if you do this even if they say how much does it cost you reach out
1:49:36
to them about a website hey Uh something's broken oh well what's broken maybe that's what they say just call
1:49:43
them hey John what's going on yeah this is blank this is so and so I just saw your text just want to
1:49:49
give you a quick call boom right start the script this is going to be way better
1:49:55
than you trying to sit over text and trying to sell the demo or trying to sell your services or try to say oh our
1:50:02
website's $100 a month or $150 a month no call them and actually book that demo
1:50:09
call call them and book the zoom call and sell it as a consultation call we'll
1:50:15
go over that though all right disclaimer this will be hard okay I know it seems
1:50:20
kind of easy okay you just download a spread cheat you use these tools you just send a bunch of emails wow I'm
1:50:26
going to I'm going to be rich I'm going to get a million clients but you must expect rejection a lot of people will reject you none of it's personal none of
1:50:34
it is personal most people won't respond and just leave you un red that is to be expected if you send 100 messages and
1:50:42
you get two meetings out of it three meetings that's good like that's pretty
1:50:49
good so that just shows you the volume that's necessary to even book anything
1:50:56
and just because you sent your first 100 emails or your first 100 DMS or your first 100 Outreach messages and you get
1:51:02
zero responses that doesn't mean that it doesn't work it just means you need more volume you need to improve your message
1:51:08
you need to keep testing these people don't know you and they probably get contacted daily by
1:51:15
others Now using R messages it's much more value upfront approach so you will
1:51:20
get a higher response rate than if you're trying to sell Facebook ads or SEO or your metadata's broken and blah
1:51:26
blah blah your page speed no it's not personal and never get
1:51:31
emotional they're not saying no to you they're just labeling you as another one of those they're saying oh this just
1:51:37
another guy oh it's it's just Spam it's just whatever it's this it's that even if they genuinely need your service
1:51:44
that's okay just move on take it on the chin and just move on if you want more clients and to make more money you need
1:51:50
to push past this and evolve it's seems like some people just don't do well with rejection but it's it's a normal part of
1:51:58
business your clients also get rejected right every house let's say they go to
1:52:06
they're not going to sign that house as a client they're doing a roof they might visit and I know this because I asked my clients and I know their closing rates
1:52:12
in remodeling bathroom kitchens these guys are closing like 30% they literally drive out to a
1:52:19
customer's home they draw up plans for what a new kitchen is going to look like sometimes they put in Crazy effort they
1:52:25
put in money they draw it out they sometimes even have a designer and they give this all out for free and they're only closing three out of
1:52:33
10 and sometimes we just need that perspective that not everyone's going to be a client and that's okay too many
1:52:40
people send 50 messages on Instagram for two days and then report back that a few people responded not interested and then
1:52:47
they give up don't be this person don't let that
1:52:52
be you our ancestors fought Tigers we survived illnesses right we had to learn
1:52:58
how to hunt making a couple calls when someone says interested or sending more messages is not that bad it's not that
1:53:06
scary I promise you you will get over it this is a marathon this is not a Sprint
1:53:11
play the long game so next Point your work works on
1:53:17
you more than you work on it let me explain what that means as you are doing this and as you are
1:53:23
building your business you must understand that you are evolving as a person and you will
1:53:30
see progress in the same linear graph as how fast you are able to evolve if you've
1:53:37
been working on yourself for 5 years and reading personal development books and
1:53:42
studying and you have laser focus maybe you're in sales maybe you're in this maybe you're on that and you've already
1:53:47
evolved that skill you're going to see success faster and that's just a fact
1:53:53
if you don't have that experience it might be a little bit slower but fear not because you only have to get good
1:53:59
one time once you learn these skills how to reach out guys remember we are literally
1:54:07
creating money out of thin air I mentioned this yesterday we're not
1:54:13
selling a physical product here we're just calling people using our voice and then money appears in your bank account
1:54:19
of course you're delivering virtual Services right but this is a superpower you are
1:54:26
learning how to get people interested you're learning marketing and then once people show that interest and you get
1:54:31
them on a call you are learning sales and once you get good this will transfer into anything and everything
1:54:39
that you do this is very important to
1:54:44
remember this is what it looks like you may have seen this portrait but I love
1:54:50
this this is all the stuff that you're working on no one's going to see it the first six months again my first year I got three clients three clients very low
1:54:57
paying everyone thought it was a waste of time dude why are you doing this why' you why'd you leave school for
1:55:03
this what's your backup plan but I was building everything below
1:55:11
this this is extremely important to remember because in the
1:55:16
beginning people they might doubt you they don't see the results that you're generating
1:55:22
you have nothing to show for it you're working extremely hard and you have nothing and that's okay because this is
1:55:30
that Rocky cut scene right this is that Rocky cut scene to where you are training and you are putting in that work and then once you get the success
1:55:37
it'll look like an overnight success it's like this year right I I I became a
1:55:44
top go high level affiliate but no one sees that I started my company in 2017 no one sees that I started traveling full-time in 2019 took me years and
1:55:51
years and years and then even after I was already successful I was running this business for years and years and years and years before I ever became an
1:55:57
affiliate and sort of teaching anyone anything Focus you could you know just
1:56:02
if you could help us understand here for someone that is is is trying to figure out like public you're sharing all this
1:56:10
you know helpful insightful you know encouraging information but like is websites the
1:56:18
right way to lead um is is you know can can websites really help me grow my
1:56:24
business like everybody could build their own website everybody can go to a website provider and do it themselves
1:56:30
why do they need me could you share a little bit about how you started to see your product Market fit from a
1:56:36
professional service doing it hands and setting everything up and then at that point taking off and and and automating
1:56:43
it or or you know putting processes to to be done like an assembly line like you've shared before how did that switch
1:56:50
happen yeah definitely mind like like websites that's it there's obviously
1:56:55
more to it but could you share something yeah so websites are the foot in the door offer
1:57:01
websites is what we're leading with websites is what we're starting with and yes a lot of people already do have
1:57:06
websites but their websites suck I've gotten clients that already have had a website I've had clients that have just
1:57:13
gotten a new website one year ago or two years ago if you show them their websites and their competitors's
1:57:18
websites or you show them how to build a proper High converting website with a phone number at the top and we're
1:57:24
going to cover this in day three but with the phone number at the top right a form at the top a everything above the
1:57:31
fold something that's actually going to help them get more clients to get them more booked appointments they are way
1:57:38
more likely to hire you it doesn't matter I showed you the spreadsheet okay
1:57:43
there's a lot of people that don't have websites so yes we're leading with the website in a Day offer some of these
1:57:49
people will want custom websites that's fine charge them 4K 5K 6K some of these
1:57:55
people that you reach out to right here again we're mentioning their reviews right so you can lead with the website
1:58:02
maybe they don't want the website but they want the reviews now you can sell them go high
1:58:07
level sass so this is just the Outreach method once you're actually on Zoom you can sell them anything you want whatever
1:58:14
their pain is you're going to sell that and we're going to cover the demo call and the zoom consultation call and we're going to cover all of that here soon
1:58:22
so again I just want to emphasize this is simply what we're leading with right and it's up to you it's up to
1:58:30
you what you want your core offer to be you can also take these messages and gear it towards reviews as you can see
1:58:38
so and also even if let's say these people have 215 reviews 4.8 start
1:58:44
rating let's say that their website doesn't feature any reviews how do you
1:58:49
sell a new website well they have all these review reviews and maybe their website is not bad but it's not
1:58:54
featuring reviews at all there's no social proof on it you can even say that to them on Zoom hey look you have 215
1:59:01
freaking reviews people love you people Rave about you but when I go to your website it looks like you have no
1:59:08
clients you have two images of your team and zero project photos right specific
1:59:15
for landscaping this right as as I'm we're here you know an hour into this
1:59:20
intense framework strategy what you're saying to me if I'm understanding it right is be the
1:59:26
business advisor correct look at from a business perspective look at others that are in
1:59:33
their market and how they're doing it and just let them know that hey look you might be too deep in the weeds in your
1:59:39
day-to-day operation this is what I recommend we start implementing on a road map of how
1:59:44
we can help you get more of those customers and show them more of your talents is that aligned with your
1:59:50
approach or how you do it yes that's 100% correct and we're going to go into how I actually sell this but my sales
1:59:58
method is very Socratic and what I mean by that is I ask questions and I just have them tell
2:00:05
me look Mr business owner this is your website this is your top competitor's
2:00:10
website let's just say hypothetically you were a Potential
2:00:16
Prospect right you didn't know yourself and you didn't know your competitor just by looking at this like
2:00:22
let's scroll down and then let's scroll down on theirs on yours we don't see any photos of you there's no photos of a
2:00:27
face they're all stock images there's zero reviews on this website in fact on
2:00:33
mobile it doesn't even look good it looks completely disarranged and messed
2:00:38
up your competitors have it nicely look at this they have all their reviews at the top they have their phone number
2:00:44
here nicely they have a bunch of project photos they have even a case study video of their clients raving about them and
2:00:50
and then look at this look how it looks on their phone look how it looks on mobile if you were a potential customer
2:00:56
who would you hire who like who would you rather work with who would you trust your money with your hard-earned money
2:01:02
who would you spend it with and I'd let them tell me okay yeah
2:01:09
okay maybe it's them and then if they still don't get it I bring up the I ask
2:01:17
them how they spend money on Amazon and I say look you're on Amazon right you don't know what business from who you're
2:01:23
just looking for the best product for the cheapest price with the most reviews and I'll even ask them that hey
2:01:28
when you're on Amazon you're shopping for boots or I don't know a t-shirt how do you
2:01:35
shop for that what do you do there's no brand loyalty there you're just on there you just need a t-shirt or you just need
2:01:41
some boots you're going to look at the product you're going to look at which one has good images that are not grainy
2:01:48
that look legit and then what you look at their reviews you look at which product has the
2:01:54
highest not just rating but has the highest number of reviews in general you
2:02:00
were you're looking at people that are leaving photos and so forth and then once they confirm that's how they shop
2:02:05
on Amazon that's how they shop and that's how people do it online then they're they're usually
2:02:11
pretty receptive to that message does that make sense John cool let's keep going Focus let's
2:02:19
talk about Focus the only way to get where you want to go is by focusing on needle mover activities you want to keep
2:02:26
testing different messages and channels we've talked about that let's talk about what you should stop focusing
2:02:32
on what's the newest web design Trend how do I get better at creating visual
2:02:38
elements on my website let's keep making more website templ let's just live in
2:02:44
the Builder and keep dragging and dropping different things so let's focus on all the tech and all the automations
2:02:51
what's the best way to stop style a hero image background what's the best way to design what's the newest Trend and this
2:02:57
and that what's the newest theme no what when I mention all of this I'm
2:03:04
not saying that these aren't important especially if you are an experienced web designer or web developer you probably
2:03:12
well you might even disagree with what I said and that's okay but I'm not saying that these aren't important I'm saying
2:03:18
you need to bring in cash flow first and then you can can get better at your craft with real clients and real
2:03:24
feedback from the market to actually get better you need Real
2:03:30
Results how do you think you're going to get better if you're not actively working with
2:03:37
clients how will you get better if you're not getting feedback
2:03:43
and you're not speaking with your actual Market you change something on a website and you ask your client hey how does
2:03:49
this look hey how do you like this hey what else do you want to see on this website you can spend all the hours in
2:03:55
the world tweaking it and studying and this and that but until you start working with real clients and delivering
2:04:01
actual websites actual results actual Google review campaigns and database reactivation campaigns and once you
2:04:07
start all of this before you even feel like the expert and you learn on the job you
2:04:12
learn as you go that's when you're going to get better and better and better and better and you'll learn more about your
2:04:19
Niche so let's craft your Outreach message they have no
2:04:24
website is this business name is this ABC Landscaping I was looking for a landscaper in Las Vegas just looked you
2:04:31
up online insert their their Facebook link Instagram link LinkedIn link whatever but couldn't tell if you were
2:04:39
open love that you have four reviews but it said closed for some reason thought I
2:04:44
build you a new one for free and maybe you'll like it better plus maybe get more estimates now again this is
2:04:51
specific two landscapers they speak in estimates and jobs and so forth so again I know their language so the email
2:04:58
resonates anyways let me know if you want to see it would be a good place to feature those reviews the first draft is
2:05:04
already done if not no worries I can throw it away let me know so this is again a
2:05:12
template that you can take and you can use as you can see it sounds custom it
2:05:18
sounds like we sat down and wrote this all out and even if you're not using any fancy tools just do this yourself right
2:05:24
just copy this and then just insert all the data that you have here if you don't have a budget you don't want to spend
2:05:30
any money just insert the data here very simple this this is very simple and and
2:05:37
as I'm trying to like I'm saying it to myself you know if I were to take my phone and I say you know hi is is this
2:05:44
JB's Landscaping awesome I was looking for a landscaper in so and so my area I just
2:05:51
looked you up on online went on to your social media but I couldn't tell if you were open are you guys open that's
2:05:56
amazing okay great love that you know have a bunch of reviews but it said you were close for some reason thought I'd
2:06:02
build you a new website for free and maybe if you like it and it's better
2:06:07
than what you have now in your opinion we can help you get more estimates would you be okay with that anyways let me
2:06:12
know if you want to say like like it's going to take some practice but as I'm just winging here with you and I have my
2:06:18
phone in my hand it it comes off at least question give them room to respond
2:06:24
question give them room to respond and I've seen you do this on your YouTube video but for someone that's like
2:06:29
learning and listening to this like can't be that easy if it was that easy Buble John and audience members wouldn't
2:06:37
everybody be doing it what is your answer to that I think I think no one has actually
2:06:45
tried it because I also think if you're cold calling which by the way we are actually going to review a live sales
2:06:51
call I'm not just going to show it to you but I'm going to break down exactly why I said what I said and I'm going to break down my tone because if you say
2:06:58
the same message in a different tone than I say it in it can still sound very
2:07:04
bad and you'll still get hung up on so it is important that I break this down for you when it comes to emails and all
2:07:09
this other stuff honestly no one is really doing this right and even when you do it right I mean still like I said
2:07:16
if you book three meetings that's that's a win and not only that but some people
2:07:21
we just drop the ball on the actual demo call on the zoom sales call so yeah you might get meetings but maybe you're just
2:07:27
better at sales than someone else or maybe you resonate with this person than someone else right we all have our own unique
2:07:34
personalities so let's keep going we got got that live sales call coming up here
2:07:39
very soon so this is another variation is this ABC
2:07:44
Landscaping is this still your number boom you insert their phone number are
2:07:50
you still open I couldn't find your website I actually built you one for free because I liked some of the photos
2:07:56
that I saw online do you want to see it first draft is already done if not no
2:08:02
worries I can throw it away let me know again very very very simple and I'm
2:08:07
going to show you how to find something wrong with the website or if it's open
2:08:13
or not open and by the way I say this for everyone that doesn't have a website if they don't have a website then I just
2:08:18
don't know if they're open I tried to look them up there's no website don't know if they're open so in case you're
2:08:24
wondering that is how I do it I say are you still open to anyone that does not have a website let's go over the Live
2:08:31
code call
2:08:39
here hey uh sorry you you broke up there for a second did you say this is
2:08:44
B&B yes sir this is BM okay okay so why did I say you broke up there when
2:08:50
you can clear really see that he did not break up that is because I want to lead with a question that he says yes to I
2:08:57
want him to immediately as soon as he picks up I want him to agree with whatever it is that I'm saying that's
2:09:02
the first thing and I want him to also engage I want to hear his voice I want to and
2:09:10
also I just want to know that I'm talking to the right person as well that is why I lead with this most people when
2:09:17
they cold call they do it completely wrong they have some kind of crazy
2:09:22
script that they're going after they they they pick up the phone hey is this John then they say yes and they say hey
2:09:30
John this is Susie from ABC web design and we actually reached out we run a web design firm that can optimize websites
2:09:37
and I've actually noticed that you have less Google reviews boom no no that no click hasn't they
2:09:44
hung up on you they hung up because I used to do it that way when I first started
2:09:49
exactly exactly and that's how you get hung up on so let me keep playing so you can see
2:09:57
what I say cool yeah I just I wasn't sure if uh you guys were open it it said closed for
2:10:03
some reason I didn't see a website or anything you guys are still like open and and doing service calls
2:10:09
right uh yes sir me the company did change about three years ago like during Co so I know we did close down for a
2:10:16
brief time but yes sir we are uh it's under new ownership okay
2:10:24
so again I want him to talk about himself hey it's a close you guys are still open right like you're doing work
2:10:31
and sometimes I'll even follow up with that because sometimes they'll say yes and if they just give you a one-word answer again this is just on a cold call
2:10:37
but this is a general philosophy that you can use on all the other Outreach channels but if they say yes sometimes I
2:10:43
I might probe even further I'm like cool so what is that that that's like kitchen remodeling bathroom remodeling like
2:10:48
basements like all that stuff right and so I just I I want them to get in the habit of responding to me so then
2:10:55
they're less likely to hang up on you and I also want this to feel like a conversation cold calls should not be
2:11:02
just me talking the whole time and then they just say yes or no okay yes I'm interested okay you want to book a
2:11:07
meeting sure because even if you do book meetings that way a lot of times they won't show up so let's keep going is a a
2:11:16
beautiful website if if I do say so myself uh if you like it you can you can keep it is that something you would you
2:11:23
would even want to look at okay so
2:11:28
I the way that I like to do this is to sound
2:11:34
like a local guy next door I think a lot of
2:11:39
these business owners are bombarded with phone calls and what I want to do is I want to sound different if I sounded too
2:11:45
professional and if you notied I'm stumbling in in some of them right so I
2:11:51
am am I'm saying yeah so look I mean I I I built you this thing right so I said I
2:11:56
a bunch of different times and that's because I just sound like a normal guy I sound like I'm just it doesn't even sound like I'm selling something cool
2:12:02
man so look I yeah I just kind of like just buil you this this website it's pretty beautiful I like it anyways do
2:12:08
you want it it sounds more natural it sounds way more normal it sounds like a
2:12:14
human being and it doesn't sound like everyone else that's reaching out to them and this is good
2:12:22
possibly you already have it built yes sir I have the homepage built uh I didn't build out the rest of the site I
2:12:28
believe in giving value first so I can show you the okay so I already have the website
2:12:33
built do I have the website built no I don't have the website built what I do
2:12:39
have built is the template though I have the template built that I'm going to be covering on day three here and this
2:12:46
template all we do is we go in there and we put his logo at the top mention this
2:12:51
already before but it's very simple if you want to replace us a couple other images as well that's fine but it takes
2:12:56
5 minutes I literally upload his website I hit copy right inside the go high level website builder I hit duplicate I
2:13:03
put his logo on I do it 5 minutes before our actual Zoom call and then I look at his I'll show you what we do but we
2:13:09
actually look at the uh the prospecting tool inside a high level it tells me how they're ranking it tells me the reviews
2:13:14
it pulls in their reviews it does all that stuff so I do that 5 10 minutes before the call the homepage and then if
2:13:20
you like it we could we could maybe um you know work together okay that sounds like have to
2:13:27
be a little bit later I'm currently on pretty massive mini escavator in the middle of a project but um we can
2:13:34
definitely take a look can you give me a call around like 3 o' yeah for sure man I was going to say it'd be better if we
2:13:39
just book it in and we could jump on zoom and I'll just show you because it's not live obviously I'll just I could just show you uh when we're on a zo
2:13:46
that's something we can definitely do let's shoot for around give me a call around 3 3:30 and then we'll sit down let me get my business partner on to him
2:13:53
and then we'll meet but it's definitely something we'd be interested in cool you guys don't have any website right now right no no apparently we do not so
2:14:01
again I want to solidify this meeting further because if I just say okay great I'll see you then and we don't really
2:14:07
have any sort of like conversation I don't know anything about him he's way less likely to show up so typically even
2:14:13
after he agrees I'll ask a couple questions and I'll just say Okay cool so like you don't have a website right now
2:14:18
okay interesting why not did you ever have a website oh okay
2:14:24
interesting and so I just let him talk more about himself okay I
2:14:29
got you know looking possi like forat and we'll talk he's even possibly
2:14:36
looking for formatting and scheduling does that sound familiar do we know do we know any kind of software that does
2:14:43
formatting and scheduling and followups I think we do let's go PA that's that's
2:14:48
on peeling the onion and that's if your ears didn't perk up and your eyebrows didn't go up like mine this is what
2:14:55
we're listening for I love this part of it all awesome man let's do it good CL
2:15:02
we'll go from there yeah for sure man I'll just show you what what I already have built uh if you want it you can you can keep it um if not that's that's cool
2:15:09
too so all right sounds good I'll chat with you at three awesome thank you cool
2:15:14
bye okay booked I do want to show you one more where I actually asked him a couple other questions after so let's
2:15:20
listen all right one meeting
2:15:27
booked and by the way I'm calling everyone inside of the go high level dialer so I'm actually doing it on my phone and I have the lead connector app
2:15:34
and I'm just I'm typing it in and I'm calling it right from within go high level hey this is uh Jr and also I'm
2:15:41
going to show you how you can automate calling one business from another so what you can essentially do is I'll show
2:15:47
you this after but you can import a list of all the contacts that you have and then it will actually automatically call
2:15:53
first person second third fourth fifth you don't have to manually type in each phone number one by one it'll just dial
2:15:58
all of them if they don't pick up it just starts dialing the second one
2:16:05
Landscaping yeah okay uh nice cool I wasn't sure if you guys are open it said said closed for some reason you guys are
2:16:12
open right I have to uh activate my account what
2:16:18
happen oh okay that's that's interesting um I actually built you guys a a beautiful site if uh you like it you can
2:16:25
keep it is that something you want to look at yeah I'm sorry I didn't hear you
2:16:34
well sure yeah I just said that I built you a beautiful website uh if you want
2:16:40
it you can keep it do you want to look at it can you send it to me by email well
2:16:48
it's not live like it's not on it's it's not online um it's I have it here on my computer so if you want I can just share
2:16:55
my screen and show you on Zoom so this will actually happen a lot when you do this method whether you're doing emails
2:17:00
or DMS or whatever some people will say okay sure send it over now again I always say call them no matter what
2:17:07
level of Interest they have anything outside of no I'm not interested call them call them and literally follow the
2:17:13
script treat it as if it's a warmer call but still call them and say hey Bob what's going on Yeah man so I just shot
2:17:18
you that Instagram on um sent you that message on Instagram uh telling you about that website so it that does sound
2:17:26
like something you would you would want to see right yeah yeah yeah uh sure but let me see it or or or or they'll say
2:17:31
how much does it cost and you could say well of course John it depends on exactly what it is that you want so
2:17:38
let's do this I can't really share you a link because it's on my screen it's not live obviously I'm not going to publish a website for you on the internet right
2:17:45
so phrase it in their benefit so let's actually go in before I publish anything let me just show you what I have and then if you want it of course we can
2:17:51
publish it so that's how you can phrase it I could do some time later today if that
2:17:56
works yeah can you to me uh well it's a zoom link so let's let's schedule and
2:18:02
then also notice so so my tone is also laidback right I doesn't I'm sure if I
2:18:09
worked in a call center they would fire me because I don't sound like every other salesperson which is actually good
2:18:16
right I'm just leaning back I'm hanging out sure man so do you want me to send it later or like what time is good for
2:18:23
you and I'm not overly excited I'm not too down I'm I'm using my tonality but
2:18:28
I'm also just presenting myself as a normal guy we we could jump on zo have you used Zoom before oh yeah yeah yeah
2:18:36
yeah okay what what did you say was down for you like why does it say that you're
2:18:41
closed I us like to start website on okay so he said yes already oh yeah Zoom
2:18:47
okay sure let's do it so now I'm probing for more there's a high chance this guy's not
2:18:52
going to show unless he tells me more about his business I could just tell that even if I book in the call he's not going to show up so now I want to get
2:18:59
some pain out of him and I want to understand why is your website
2:19:05
down uh online yeah I um I got so busy though like I
2:19:11
never finish it up like the last few things to post my uh website yeah but uh
2:19:19
if you can send me first so I can probably finish it up that' be nice yeah for sure man I could help I mean if it
2:19:25
says I could also probably help you with the uh the Clos thing that you have
2:19:30
going on um so let's do this are you free today at like 300 p.m. we could
2:19:37
jump I could jump or 3:30 I could jump on Zoom just send me the link on a text
2:19:43

Link at 3:30 over text yeah just jump on I'll sh my I'll uh I'll share my screen with you and then I'll just show you the
2:19:55
full website and then we'll just take a look at what you have going on sounds good sweet all right I'll see
2:20:00
you later bye all right and then also by the way when I say I'm texting him I'm
2:20:06
texting him inside of go high level right using our tracking number and I'm texting every everything is done and managed inside of high level so anyways
2:20:15
that is uh two calls hopefully that made sense and hopefully you enjoyed that let's keep going
2:20:21
very common that I get well what if they already have a website doesn't everyone have a website a the answer is no but if
2:20:28
they do have a website here's a good script for you is this ABC Landscaping was looking
2:20:33
for a landscaper in Las Vegas just looked you up online insert their website ABC Landscaping Las vegas.com
2:20:40
but couldn't tell if you were open it said closed for some reason loved your photos and the fact that you have 56
2:20:48
reviews or five reviews but the website looked broken in a few spots thought i' build you a new one for free and maybe
2:20:55
you'll like it better plus get more estimates question mark anyways let me know if you want to see it first draft
2:21:01
is already done if not no worries I'll help you fix the issue for free and I can throw away mine happy to help let me
2:21:09
know one of the scripts I want to jump in here P this this second to last line
2:21:15
is I I love the delivery anyways let me know if you want to see it the first draft is done
2:21:22
I've already put some time into I validated that put some time into it you can see the first draft is ready to go
2:21:28
right um this the one below that if not no worries I'll help you fix the issue
2:21:33
for free I can throw away M like so like for me I'm going to put on my
2:21:39
experienced agency owner haton or maybe I've been doing this for a long time like I don't have time for free right
2:21:47
what is your response to that I don't got time to give away people free stuff I'm running a business I got a family to
2:21:52
feed how do we unpack that a little bit to understand what you mean by that yeah so it's actually nothing here is free
2:22:00
the thing is the first draft is free and the first draft is literally you copying and pasting one of the templates that we
2:22:07
have and that's it so you would jump on Zoom let me just show you then to while
2:22:12
you do that while you do that you know every conversation we have is you giving
2:22:18
your time your time is worth money um so you know look at this you know what what
2:22:23
Paul was going to show you is the technical end of that of what's not free or what is you know a value but you're
2:22:29
positioning it as free information but you spending 10 15 minutes with somebody
2:22:35
is no different than you chatting in the aisle five of the supermarket with someone from your kid's school or family
2:22:41
or a neighbor right it's all about using the time in your experience to make that time worth your time so he's not saying
2:22:49
to give anything away from free he's just saying if you're going to take a few phone calls maybe you you you block out three appointments a day to give
2:22:57
value for 15 minutes those will pay off in the future with maybe some follow-ups
2:23:03
or at least a relationship to pick up where you left off is that accurate do do am I aligning
2:23:10
here I don't want to put words in your mouth pubble but I do want to make sure cu the audience might have different
2:23:15
opinions on this yeah so yeah one thing I want to emphasize because I also see
2:23:21
this I see this sometimes with people that don't fully understand this model but nothing here is free what we do is
2:23:28
we sign is we get them on the zoom call we phrase this as a as a as a consultation they jump on and you just
2:23:36
put their logo right here remember how we did the custom values right so you go in here you add the custom values if
2:23:42
you'd like you're going to make a separate sub account this is going to get a little bit technical but you make a separate sub account if you want even
2:23:48
a lot of times I don't even do this I I just go right here let's say concrete boom clone I just hit clone and
2:23:55
that's it I put their logo at the top and I just show them this look this is the first draft of the site and if you
2:24:01
work with all concrete companies maybe you have content already in here that just talks about concrete yeah this is the first draft look at our site look at
2:24:08
your site he's going to say oh well that's that's not me well we don't have those reviews we don't have these photos exactly John that's why I said this is
2:24:14
the first draft we built this for you and then the next draft we're going to build out everything else for you
2:24:21
now if you want that it's $150 a month let's keep going so we covered this has a website is this you so this is the is
2:24:27
this you method is this ABC Landscaping is this still your number question mark
2:24:33
are you still open your website wasn't clear and had a few things broken boom right so ABC landscaping.com actually
2:24:40
fixed the errors for free and even built you a new one because you seem to have raving reviews do you want to see it
2:24:45
first draft is already done if not no worries I can throw it away let me know
2:24:51
another angle again it's a slight variation on the angle and you can ab
2:24:56
test this and I wanted to give you a couple different angles so you can actually see for yourself on how you can
2:25:02
go in and switch this around a little bit so it sounds
2:25:07
different so how do you actually create winning variations you don't want to be a one-trick pony copy and paste
2:25:14
entrepreneur the best people that succeed with this model or with any model they slightly tweak it it right
2:25:21
you have so much data you have their social media you have their if their Google my businesses verified take these
2:25:27
variations play around with them put different lines on top maybe take different lines and put them below the
2:25:33
other right maybe you want to say in the very first line I built you a free
2:25:38
website first draft is done right I don't know now maybe don't say free website I built you a free first draft
2:25:45
boom that's what you want to say so test all of this find some kind of advantage that you have over
2:25:50
everyone example if your dad's a dentist mention that in your Outreach right so you can mention that in your message if
2:25:57
you have CA if you have case studies or testimonials mention that as well in that message or you can mention it in
2:26:04
the follow-up messages you should always be testing different variations angles messages everything biggest impact will
2:26:11
always be the first line and subject line in your DMs and in your messages if you're sending emails very simple
2:26:17
subject lines work like is this blank right is this business name is this business owner name that kind of stuff
2:26:24
that's what I would do don't be a one trick pony copy and paste entrepreneur it's added in there twice so where to
2:26:31
actually Reach Out Instagram page you can do 30 to 50 DMS per day Facebook
2:26:37
page 30 to 50 a day Facebook profile add plus send 30 to 50 per day LinkedIn you
2:26:44
can send about 30 to 60 messages per day and then cold email if if you want again
2:26:51
just make a new Gmail warm it up a little bit and by warm it up I just mean like just subscribe to a couple newsletters and just wait a week to two
2:26:57
weeks let those newsletters come in so it's not a brand new email and then just start sending 20 emails per day from that uh if you want to actually scale
2:27:04
that up and send 00 per day uh this is the tool that we use is called instantly
2:27:10
so there it is and then of course cold calling some other strategies would be
2:27:15
Facebook groups you want to make value posts and connect with other people people and add them as a friend now
2:27:21
about Facebook groups you don't want to go in and promote anything just go in and just start asking questions or my
2:27:28
favorite strategy is going in and just posting memes just go in there just make a meme use a kind of meme generator for
2:27:33
that Niche and post that in there everyone that likes him just add him as a friend or just go in and just start
2:27:39
sharing stuff and start commenting on other people's posts and from there you can also and this is a bit more advanced
2:27:46
but it works so well you can connect with the owner of the Facebook group
2:27:51
let's say you're in landscaping just to keep the examples consistent imagine you met the owner of that Facebook group and
2:27:59
you did all of their marketing for free or whatever is that you're offering you built him a website for free maybe
2:28:04
you're doing Facebook ads or Google or automations right you're offering the high level SAS stuff you did all that stuff for free
2:28:11
form and then you even partnered up with him you said hey you see how this
2:28:16
works could you promote this in the group happy to give you you a percentage and you give him a percentage of each
2:28:23
sale now he's just promoting you he's doing all the selling for you this is
2:28:28
called a strategic partnership he owns this massive Facebook group for him he just makes a couple posts and now he
2:28:34
just went from zero to 5K a month to 10K a month to whatever number you want and you don't have to actually reach out to
2:28:40
clients you have someone that's advertising you raving about you on your behalf that is another good strategy so
2:28:49
Partnerships Al together connect with anyone that does business with your Niche and actually one of the first
2:28:55
marketing agencies that I used to work at when I was an employee I was a senior web designer I did all their websites we
2:29:01
did hundreds of websites they had a strategic partnership they were in the dental
2:29:08
Niche and they specifically worked with implants and they partnered up with a
2:29:14
dental implant lab meaning a lab that creates the actual implants that goes inside people's mouths who did they sell
2:29:22
to who buys implants dentists dentists buy the implants so what do they do they
2:29:28
partnered up with them they gave them a percentage and now all they have to do is send emails from that dental lab to
2:29:35
all their existent clients and they're making so much money both people it's a strategic partnership CU that dental lab
2:29:42
they're double dipping they already have the customers now all they have to do is promote another service and they get to
2:29:49
get get all of the referral bonuses and they can make thousands of dollars per month extra just by referring something
2:29:57
out this company scaled from zero to over a million dollars in their first year a million dollars per year that is
2:30:03
in their very first year it's a seven figure agency local business groups BNI Chamber
2:30:09
of Commerce when you join these groups you can choose a category on where your business is and you can
2:30:16
choose a category that you want to be classified is you can choose a web designer I would recommend you choose
2:30:22
digital marketing or digital advertising because then it kind of encompasses everything and then you don't have to switch and typically what
2:30:28
they do is they have one person in that group so you're sitting at a table of 30 business owners I think in Europe and in
2:30:34
like the UK they also have these groups they're called something else but BNI and Chamber of Commerce are just us-based and you're sitting at a table
2:30:41
of 30 business owners sometimes 20 sometimes 40 and these are owners these are CEOs and you're there and there's
2:30:48
one person in each industry meaning you're the only digital marketer in that room there's one guy that owns a
2:30:54
landscaping business one guy owns a real estate company one guy that owns an HVAC business one guy that owns a roofing
2:30:59
business one guy that's a chiropractor and they all do business with each other great way to scale your
2:31:06
company locally it's not scalable because you have all the different Industries and there's only so many
2:31:12
clients of course you can get from that but it is a great place to start so let's look at some bonus
2:31:18
Outreach channels you can send automated video Outreach messages so this is Advanced by the way this is going to be
2:31:25
more advanced you can send automated video Outreach messages to prospects with your face talking to a camera I
2:31:30
recommend you do this after you already have some clients but I did want to throw it in here so it's not all basic
2:31:36
strategies but we have some advanced stuff you film a video one time you upload it to this website right here it's TR reply
2:31:42
q.com upload the list of prospects that you again you already have you already generated the prospects and this tool
2:31:48
will pull up their existing website or just Google Maps listing in their area
2:31:54
and put your face in front of it like your scrolling like you're filming a loom
2:31:59
video and like you're making them a custom video like this so you choose okay what do you want to show in the
2:32:05
background I'll show you what this looks like in in in practice here as well so you choose a website if they don't have a website you choose Google right here
2:32:12
and it's just going to pull it's they're just going to see all their competitors all the landscapers in Las Vegas right
2:32:18
this is how it looks you send that email right so use one of our scripts and then you say hey I have
2:32:24
a video outlining that boom your face right here that you have in the bottom left you film that one time and what
2:32:32
this tool does is pull up their website and it actually Scrolls down through the website as if you're talking to a camera
2:32:37
like this and as if you're scrolling and screen sharing and everything else same as this video and it does it
2:32:44
automatically so again you can't say the the business owner's name in the video of course but you can customize the
2:32:50
email and then just share something about their website right share that you found something broken and they'll watch
2:32:56
the video and they'll think that you made it specifically for them that's how you could do this in bulk I don't see
2:33:02
this tool talked about very much so hope you uh take advantage of that um
2:33:07
we'll talk about a couple different tools so again we have this I'm going to show you I just have one more uh tool
2:33:14
that I want to talk about with cold calling and then we'll actually dive into the
2:33:21
uh because this is inside high level and then we'll dive into how to actually convert people on the on the
2:33:27
call on the zoom call into paying customers so let's look at this this is the power dialer so all you do is you
2:33:34
import a list like this right with their phone numbers again you want to make sure they're cell phone numbers so that
2:33:40
way you're calling cell phones and you're going to import them into here and it's going to automatically call one
2:33:45
business owner after the next after the next I'm not going to explain what every single step does because we'd be here for a while all you have to know is it
2:33:52
dials one person then the next then the next then the next if if they don't pick up if they obviously if they answer then
2:33:57
it stops and you talk to them that's the automated way to do it this is what happens this is the follow-up message
2:34:03
and if they don't respond so if they don't respond if it's a good number then it waits one minute sends
2:34:10
him a text message and it sends him voicemail one right then it waits a day did they reply did they not
2:34:18
reply day number two right sms2 voicemail 2 sms 3 voicemail 3
2:34:25
this is Advanced but long story short you have something like this you're cold calling and if someone doesn't pick up
2:34:31
you just mark them as no pickup now they're getting automatic text messages they're getting automatic voicemails dropped in their inbox so you don't have
2:34:37
to spend all of your time texting them and emailing and this and that and and now as someone responds to a text you
2:34:43
can call them once again and now you can really maximize the whole point of all
2:34:48
this is to maximize this list that you generate cuz a lot of people try to generate these lists and this and that
2:34:54
and this and that and then they say oh well it's it's run out and by the way this is not very expensive to do this is like a couple dollars outs scraper is
2:35:00
one of the cheapest tools you can get it's a couple dollars to get this not very expensive so that is a tool within
2:35:07
high level let's actually go back though and let me show you okay what do we actually say to get people to pay us our
2:35:15
sales process so again that intro call our process is a two call close we do the intro call just
2:35:21
introductory and then we do the actual demo call where we sell them and we collect payment on that call that's it
2:35:27
the first call if you if you're Cod calling that first call is the intro call so as you notice on my code calls I
2:35:33
am going in and I'm booking in the zoom call the zoom consultation call the official Zoom
2:35:38
call that is the intro call on that call it's going to be 5 to 10 minutes okay
2:35:43
and you're going to get the prospect on the phone so again if you're reaching out on LinkedIn on Instagram on Facebook
2:35:49
any any way anytime they show anything any kind of interest and by the way don't ask for their phone number as well
2:35:55
if if you're talking to people on DM like these are local business owners guys you can Google their business name
2:36:01
and find their phone number it's easy to find so do that if someone says yes Google their business name and you could
2:36:08
text them again let's say you're on Instagram and say hey this is your best number right question mark boom plop in
2:36:13
their number or you might have it in that spreadsheet and just call them get them on the phone don't ask them if you
2:36:19
can call them just call them show them you're real and friendly right make some jokes just be a normal human being stop
2:36:26
being robotic and stop following a script so yes we do have a script I've given you some scripts you've heard me
2:36:32
cold call but just be a normal person hey man what's going on yeah I saw that
2:36:37
you did X hey I saw that you did y dude I got to say your photos are amazing I like this one right here I'm on your
2:36:43
website right now wow you did this wow you've been in business for how long dude that's awesome I'm actually kind of
2:36:48
shocked that you've been in business for for for seven years and you only have seven reviews I'm assuming I'm assuming
2:36:55
you have more than one customer per year right then you just both laugh about it yeah yeah I just I just forget to get
2:37:01
reviews and and you know uh I'm just so busy I'm a business owner and uh I just don't ask for reviews because I don't
2:37:08
know how you said okay cool I mean uh would it I mean do you have the link like do you know how to actually share
2:37:14
like your Google my business link with your customer so you can actually get more reviews sometimes they'll say yeah it's it's lost somewhere it's this and
2:37:20
that and then again you can use that and that's part of your demo okay well cool well how about this John uh I'm actually
2:37:25
going to look you up and I'll I'll actually find that review link for you that you have lost and on our demo call
2:37:30
when I find it I'll just give it to you so again provide as much value as possible okay cool so I'll just find that link and I'm just going to give it
2:37:36
to you so you can just start sending it to your past customers right away because honestly all your competitors have like 77 reviews so let's at least
2:37:43
you know get another 10 or 20 reviews and I'll show you exactly how to do that on on the next call so again you see I'm
2:37:49
selling value this isn't just a sales call cool and I'm going to find this for you I'm going to do this for you and that's very easy to do right we all know
2:37:56
how to do that you just Google the business and then you have to Google my business just hit the share link and that's it ask good questions and make
2:38:02
them think find the pain this is the Socratic method again do not sell yourself on these
2:38:09
Services sell what happens on the demo call you are there as a consultant you
2:38:15
are there to even say things like look I'm to do an in-depth analysis into what
2:38:22
your competitors are doing and I'm going to show you what they're doing do you want to see do you know who ABC or XYZ
2:38:28
Landscaping is oh yeah yeah they've been in business actually we've been in business longer than them but they you know they're just new and I see their
2:38:35
trucks all the time like a lot of these guys know their competitors right whether it's a chiropractor who who else
2:38:40
right they all know their competitors and so we want to use that to our advantage and say cool well what if I did an in-depth analysis I'll just take
2:38:46
a look at like where they're showing up online and where they're getting their customers from would you even want to see that right what person is going to
2:38:53
say no that's a good offer that's like a paid consultation you're analyzing their business you're analyzing their their
2:38:59
Marketplace and a lot of times you'd be shocked these people never actually even Google their own business they never Google and see who the top competitors
2:39:05
are and they're so busy for us it's common sense right you need to have an internet presence but it's not common
2:39:11
sense to a lot of these people or maybe they checked it a year ago but so much can change in a year and so this is
2:39:18
value this is how you can show them value to get them on that demo call ask them good questions like
2:39:26
this so let's keep moving our sales process demo call so the demo call is the actual sales calls is the actual
2:39:32
sales call you want to get on Zoom you can also use Google meets and you want to integrate this
2:39:38
inside of high level so we actually book everyone with the highle calendar and then it automatically emails them a zoom link or the Google meets link so and
2:39:45
then they automatically get followups you want to follow up with people when you're doing the demo call the same day so we follow up with them first thing in
2:39:51
the morning and you also want to follow up with them 10 minutes before the meeting maybe even like 3 hours before
2:39:56
the meeting too if you want to really ensure that they show up call them first thing in the morning like you're
2:40:02
starting your day maybe at 7:00 a.m. 8:00 a.m. 9:00 a.m. whatever time you start just call them first thing okay
2:40:08
just look at your calendar I got three meetings today Bob Joe Susie call them all just one after another and hype them
2:40:15
up for the call hey Bob what's going on yeah man dude I'm super excited for a call I found some crazy things about
2:40:22
some of your competitors I looked at some of your reviews I'm so excited to show you like it this going to be a great call man anyways so 3 p.m. is
2:40:29
still good right yes okay cool see now I hyped them up wow dude I did all this research D this website I built for you
2:40:36
it's so cool I'm so excited for you to see it right they're hyped up way more likely to show up review their existing
2:40:43
website and you want to critique it again show it side by side pull up their competitors and the way you pull up
2:40:49
their competitors is if you're working with landscapers in Las Vegas just go to Google right in front of them on Zoom
2:40:55
share your screen just typ in landscapers Las Vegas and then go to Google my
2:41:02
business go to where that pack is hit more businesses and just keep scrolling on Google Maps and be like hm I can't
2:41:09
find you now you know they're going to be lost I can't find you for some reason do are you seeing yourself because I'm
2:41:16
not seeing you hm okay let's go to page two and I'll spend like 3 minutes just like scrolling I'm like do you see
2:41:22
yourself okay I don't either now I know they're like on page seven but I
2:41:28
physically make them tell me no I don't see myself because now they're they're selling themselves wow I didn't know I
2:41:34
was so lost I didn't know all these competitors were in front of me man this is this is crazy that's how you do it show
2:41:43
competitors now we will be showing the go level automations and I'm going to show you how to do that without
2:41:49
being insanely technical don't show them the automations like I'm showing you right I'm showing all of you because
2:41:55
we're all insiders here I'll show you how the workflows work and this and that you're going to sell them the benefit of
2:42:01
the automations look when someone calls you and you don't pick up it's going to automatically text them it's called
2:42:08
missc call text back this way it saves a lead so they don't call the next person right what's the benefit of missall
2:42:13
textbook don't tell them it's going to text them instantly tell them what is actually going to happen how is that
2:42:20
going to make them more money a lot of web designers forget about this these people don't just want a website they want to make more money the website is a
2:42:26
vehicle it's just helps them build the reputation it helps showcase who they are to the world so they can charge
2:42:33
higher prices when you do lead followup when you do automatic appointments right
2:42:39
appointment booking all of this stuff telling them the benefit now you don't have to spend time you know trying to
2:42:45
call people when they're at work and playing phone tech now they're calling you back but you're busy just to book an appointment we're going
2:42:51
to send them a calendar link let them book the appointment themselves when they're available big thing is you want to
2:42:58
collect payment on this call on the demo
2:43:03
call so make sure you try to over we'll talk about objections here and and and
2:43:09
closing but this is the general framework you always collect payment whether it's a custom website website in
2:43:15
a day you collect payment on this call as I mentioned earlier we don't do anything for free here's a live website
2:43:21
sales call I'm not going to click into this this is a a YouTube video but I'm not going to click into this uh we'll have this in the resources at the at the
2:43:28
end here but you can actually watch me close a live client and then collect this credit card at the end and this one's actually interesting because this
2:43:34
guy told me that he was spending like $60 a month or $40 a month and he said that was too
2:43:39
expensive so I sold him a $4,000 website you can see how I did that on
2:43:45
that sales call so demo call outline finding the paino so again always on Zoom you have to learn about them you
2:43:51
have to audit them this is like an audit call share your screen look at their website online presence reviews and ask
2:43:57
them questions the way you sell is by getting them to realize that they actually need you or need your services
2:44:04
and that they need to improve and at the end you tie it all back and say look we could do all this I mean do you
2:44:11
want us just to take care of this for you then the they've been saying yes the entire call and they're just going to
2:44:16
say okay sure yes they know they the pain most people I feel like when they
2:44:21
pitch web design anything SAS anything they just list out all these
2:44:27
features and they talk 80% of the time that is not how you should
2:44:33
sell my style of selling again Socratic method I ask questions have have they
2:44:38
had a website in the past so Bob have you had a website in the in the past or or if they have a a bad website hey so
2:44:45
has your website always been like this like has it always been kind of broken like this or what are your
2:44:50
thoughts right have them tell you oh yeah uh I haven't had a website in so long or I used to have a website or yeah
2:44:57
I had this other website and it was better blah blah blah just have them talk about themselves all of these guys or girls want to talk about themselves
2:45:04
how much traffic do they get hey John so on average like how much traffic do you actually get on your website a lot of
2:45:10
times they don't know that's a problem too you're like oh interesting I mean do you know how many phone calls you get
2:45:16
okay so you're not tracking that either uh how many people see your your your Google business profile like do they
2:45:22
click there and then they go to your main website or like how how does it work how many people fill out the form right point out stuff that they're
2:45:29
probably not tracking and then they're going to be like oh you're right I don't know that why don't I know
2:45:36
that point all this out what don't they like about it what don't they like about
2:45:41
their existing website what do they like hey if we can improve something like what do you really love about this site
2:45:48
what do you not like about it ask them and they'll just tell you and then so at the end you could you can sell that to
2:45:53
them they'll tell you what they want is someone managing the website right now how much do they actually
2:45:59
pay how are they getting their website leads delivered currently is it SEO are you paying
2:46:05
someone to optimize your Google Business someone doing SEO on your website is someone running Facebook ads Instagram ads like how how are you promoting this
2:46:12
is it all word of mouth is it newspaper ads is it TV commercials is it radio
2:46:17
commercials do you want leads or you want booked appointments this is crucial we have clients that will tell us hey I
2:46:23
want more leads I want more this I want more that but at the end of the day they don't want that they want booked
2:46:28
appointments and so I'll tell them look at the end of the day you want booked appointments I'll tell you right now our
2:46:35
leads as soon as I fill out this form this estimate form it redirects them to a calendar where they can automatically
2:46:41
book and sometimes people say oh well well I don't want them to be able to book like let's let's say it's a chiropractor I don't want them to book
2:46:48
directly into myice office I want to speak to them first I want my front desk to speak to them first or let's say a
2:46:53
landscaper that goes out to someone's home says well I don't want I don't want them just to schedule it because what if
2:46:58
they're too far I don't want to drive out there no problem here's the solution you book them the initial phone call so
2:47:05
for them they're doing an intro call now and you're going to help them do that intro
2:47:11
call right and so you're going to book that intro call so now they now they wake up in the morning and they and they
2:47:17
look at their phone they look at their calendar and they see a bunch of meetings on there and sure it's phone meetings right
2:47:22
just like 15 minute 10 minute phone meetings but you're automatically booking this so now they don't have to like try to code call their leads and
2:47:29
and reach out to these people that submitted a website form now they're calendar appointments of when their
2:47:35
potential customers are looking for them to call them so what do they want for
2:47:41
their company in the future right show do you want to show more images of your work do you have staff that you want to
2:47:47
add to the website what it is what is it that you actually want ask good questions show them you understand their
2:47:54
Niche so I know we covered a lot there John you have any questions for me so you know if I'm listening to this
2:48:02
I'm thinking wow you know this went from what I thought was just an easy concept
2:48:07
of right positioning websites templates um and and maybe depending if if the
2:48:13
person is like well where did this shift happen what
2:48:18
you're giving here is a lot of context around the framework the conversation the prospect experience
2:48:26
building Authority building um you know um recommendation getting the right to
2:48:31
to tell them that you're the right choice to help them make this a reality it's not just hey let me get you a
2:48:37
website and and get you going it's more of building the friendship relationship
2:48:43
um and saying Hey I want to work with you side by side and then upselling and growing their business with them because
2:48:49
of that so it's more it's more strategy than just technical website building it
2:48:55
looks like here if from as we're looking at what we're doing here am I right yeah I mean h 110% you'll get some people
2:49:02
that they'll just they're cool with the website being 150 a month they'll ask for it you can tell them and they'll
2:49:07
just they'll be happy to just pay you will get that but also some people here are selling custom websites if you're
2:49:12
selling a website for $6,000 you have to do all this right now I recommend you do all this anyways because the goal is not
2:49:19
just to get a $150 a month hosting website right you want a SAS client paying you $300 $500 a month then
2:49:25
eventually as you learn ads and you learn all the other add-on Services you could charge $2,000 a month how do you do that you do this you do that with
2:49:32
this as the foundation so let's keep going show don't tell you want to show
2:49:37
them their competitors and their websites this is how I do it I just pull up their competitors Google reviews uh i
2:49:43
p their their competitors websites who would you rather move forward with and let me show you some something else that
2:49:49
I like to show this is a go high level prospecting Tool uh and so now we can
2:49:54
actually dive in I'll show you what that looks like so you're going to go in here where it says add a prospect this is your agency view you're going to hit
2:50:00
prospecting let's say you type in landscapers Las Vegas near Las Vegas
2:50:08
Nevada boom it's going to give you a bunch of businesses now here's the cool thing we talked about
2:50:14
segmenting and what you can do as this is loading is you can segment People
2:50:19
based around whether they have WordPress right their Google business profile status based on their reviews based on
2:50:27
anything that you want okay there it is now it's loading in this tells you whether they have WordPress or not so if
2:50:33
you're selling a custom website for $66,000 and it's on WordPress then you can go in and see
2:50:40
who's not running on WordPress and then try to sell them that buil an out build an Outreach message around that and so
2:50:46
forth so let me actually show you what a report here looks like so I did one
2:50:51
right here again this is this is not a client this is a random business that I just picked so if you click into it you
2:50:57
can scroll down and it will give you show
2:51:02
report boom it'll give you a bunch of data it'll tell you whether they have a
2:51:08
chat widget it'll tell you whether it's a WordPress site text enabled business number this is super powerful if they
2:51:14
miss a call they should be automatically sending text messages if someone fills out a contact form on their website they should be automatically responding via
2:51:21
text right their claim status review replies are you responding to all your reviews now this business is doing an an
2:51:28
awesome job most aren't most businesses are definitely not responding to 100% of their reviews it'll show you their
2:51:33
ranking right here how are they showing up it'll show you other competitors it'll even show you their listings and
2:51:40
it says a lot of them are inaccurate so now as you can see the Outreach message is I found something broken this tool
2:51:46
will pull that for you it'll show you what they have that's broken boom online reputation again most
2:51:53
people are not going to have only fstar reviews and it even pulls in their exact reviews then it shows their listings
2:51:59
this could be another thing so what's broken well what's broken is I see you're not on Facebook I see you're not on all of these other search results and
2:52:07
so you're missing out on a bunch of traffic the other thing you could say is I saw you know maybe the page speed is
2:52:14
not that good maybe the SEO score is not that good or maybe the errors right here the desktop
2:52:20
report this is all the stuff that's broken now I think though if people see this
2:52:27
tool and by the way you could generate this as a report as well uh at the top here it says export PDF so if you didn't
2:52:33
want to send that to them you could and it basically says all that info in like a nice PDF like this right analyzes
2:52:39
everything and I think you are at risk though of being too technical with this
2:52:46
because it does give you a lot of technical info the business owner wants to know what's in it for them what does this mean for them and that's why I
2:52:53
always say compare it to their competitors show them this is what's
2:52:58
happening there's an error but at the end of the day John look I'll be honest your website yes it has all these errors
2:53:04
and it's not list all these different platforms and sure you're missing out on leads that are maybe searching on Bing
2:53:09
or on Yahoo or on wherever you're not listed but at the end of the day honestly if we just put your phone
2:53:15
number at the top and we just added a calendar next to your website form submission and we just called it in estimate form and put it at the very top
2:53:21
dude you're going to get way more potential customers way more leads so relate it all back make sure you speak
2:53:28
their language only then do you go into what you have prepared right so show your website in a day explain why things
2:53:35
are the way they are in depth so example people read left to right so we have the
2:53:40
form right here to the right of the text we have the image this way we have the phone number at the top so people can
2:53:45
just call you when someone fills out a form and goes to this calendar and it and we send exactly this message right
2:53:51
here to followup because we found that it works even if you say because you just add in any reason you want because
2:53:57
X it's going to make you way more trusted I think I read that once in a psychology
2:54:03
book people went into a store and the the experiment was essentially people said hey can I get a discount because X
2:54:10
and no matter what they said because whatever because I because it's my birthday because I feel like it because
2:54:15
anything they were more likely to get that discount so just say because X because Y and then
2:54:23
they'll like you and they'll trust you more if they like it keep the website in a Day package if they dislike it maybe
2:54:28
they don't like the website in a day that you show them they want to change a bunch of things that's great too amazing
2:54:34
no problem John again this was just the first draft I'm excited to get this custom for you we can adjust everything so you want all organic content look
2:54:40
we'll have our writers write it for you we'll do X we'll do y we'll do Z everything boom sell them a custom website that's 4K assume they want the
2:54:48
SAS lead follow-up automations as well so just package it up if you're doing custom website designs website in a day
2:54:55
sell the lead follow-up sell the Google reviews the database reactivation everything together as if it's one
2:55:00
package focus on what they said their pain was earlier in the call that is how
2:55:06
you're going to go in and close so closing last part of the demo call
2:55:12
find what they like the most so out of all this John what sounded the best to you like look where do you see the value
2:55:18
like where what do you think would help you the most and then gaug it off of that sell that collect payment on the
2:55:25
zoom call at the end of the demo call you should have a paid invoice and recurring billing set up here's how much
2:55:31
we charge and again we do this inside of high level there's a payments tab you're going to go in there and you can create
2:55:36
the invoice and collect the payment there website in a day 150 a month website with SAS 300 a month custom
2:55:43
website $4 to $6,000 upfront then $100 per month hosting
2:55:49
we usually accept half UPF front so if they're paying let's say $6,000 we'll collect 3K up front 3K upon completion
2:55:57
but you can also break it down so if they need to do $2,000 payments and or all they can do is 2K then just collect
2:56:03
2,000 per month for 3 months even though you launched the website let's say in a month you can collect it over multiple
2:56:11
months once the call ends and payment is done you're going to send the welcome email with the onboarding form link and
2:56:16
by the way I'm going to show you all that I'm going to show you the exact onboarding email that we sent I'll show you exact onboarding form how it all works that is what's happening in the
2:56:23
next call here on day three then you're going to send the contract and I will give you my contract as well you can
2:56:29
send within go high level for them to sign few things here we have a not to-do
2:56:36
list what you should not do is talk the majority of the call and just read
2:56:41
slides the whole time okay if you're just sitting there and you're talking and talking and talking and talking and talking your clients will not convert if
2:56:49
you focus too much on the technical web design things or concepts like WordPress or webflow or anything else well we're
2:56:55
going to put in this plugin and we're going to run this Automation and this and that they don't care show them how
2:57:01
it benefits them we're going to run this automation so that your clients get
2:57:06
followed up with instantly so they don't move on to anyone else and they start a conversation with you so you can
2:57:11
actually close them and convert them into a paying client don't focus on anything technical within go high level
2:57:17
you can show them brief but don't Focus too much on the technical focus on every feature on go high level and everything
2:57:23
you're going to integrate don't tell them about the social planner and the Google reviews and the automations and the calendar and then the payments you
2:57:29
know you can collect deposits with the payments and this no find what is the most valuable thing that they told you
2:57:37
that they're most excited about it could be reviews it could be anything and just sell that and then once you onboard them
2:57:42
now you can show them hey by the way did you know you can actually check your Instagram messages inside of our dashboard and your Facebook
2:57:48
and your anything and your Google M business right show them all that stuff hey you can actually post on your social
2:57:55
media on one platform all within our platform so instead of posting 10 times just posting here it goes everywhere
2:58:02
sell that later during the onboard don't be monotone don't be serious the entire time make some jokes don't let them
2:58:08
think about it without overcoming some of the main objections a lot of times I see this people say okay no problem I
2:58:14
want to think about it and then they just say then they just let him off the call okay sounds good let me know John
2:58:19
and then and then they let them know so don't do that let them pay the invoice
2:58:25
after the call so I was actually um this actually just happened with my salesperson so I was training them on it
2:58:30
always always always try to collect either some kind of deposit gauge their interest make sure they actually want
2:58:36
this if they don't want it and they're genuinely not not interested just move on okay is this something you even want
2:58:42
John no okay well no problem so how do you plan on solving this yourself
2:58:49
right phrase it that way so now let's overview this entire sales process and go into the weeds so these are my slides
2:58:57
right here as you can see they are built out I'm going to show you exactly how you can import them and this will allow you to sell this website and a package
2:59:04
very easily as well as custom websites and on top of that I do have a sales
2:59:11
call script that we will outline here along with some good questions you can ask some good bullet points and
2:59:17
everything else now before we dive into those slides let me show you how you can actually copy and paste them into your
2:59:24
account so if you go inside of our private Community here you can see we actually just added in a uh a bunch of
2:59:30
snapshots here uh that everyone is loving and it's funny actually when I loaded this I just saw this message
2:59:37
right here six new website subscriptions in two days hey guys I've been doing website design for a while but recently
2:59:43
in the last two days join this program and while within my first two days we've onboarded two clients needing six
2:59:49
websites each which is absolutely insane again this is a free community so uh
2:59:54
that is amazing amazing so anyway someone else asked me hey could we do
3:00:00
all of the prospecting and could we use all the strategies that are inside of this course right here and the answer is
3:00:06
yes right this is the web designer course and this is where we have the resources if you go under this section right here it says sales script and demo
3:00:12
slides so if you click on this you'll be allowed to click copy and you can copy this into your account make it your own
3:00:19
you can also view the sales script that will outline here as well uh here we have some live sales calls and then also
3:00:25
here we have a bunch of bonus like resources and you know import links for the funnel and everything else if you
3:00:32
want more ways to actually get clients if you go inside of this one right here um of course there's like full setup on
3:00:38
on go high level and all that stuff but if you go into this section right here under prospecting slinding clients as
3:00:43
you can see this is a 30 minute video and all of these are quite long that go really really in-depth into each and
3:00:49
every one of these strategies the only thing is you'll just have to change the offer from what we have here into the
3:00:55
website in a Day package so without further Ado let's dive into the sales
3:01:00
script template here so I want you to treat this script as the foundation okay not something that you're going to
3:01:06
follow word for word you want to familiarize yourself with it and then also adapt it to who you are in your
3:01:13
style and then just personalize it right the aim is to use this as a support supportive tool during the calls uh not
3:01:20
something that's super super strict now when you're doing this uh we have a preparation for the video call so you
3:01:26
want to log in on Zoom or Google meets a couple minutes early make sure you're ready you want to make sure you have the
3:01:31
slides open that we're going to outline here have your go high level sample account ready so this is even if you have no clients like just have an empty
3:01:37
account open like this that you can at least reference right where you have your funnels you have your websites or maybe this is a client that you did a
3:01:44
homepage for and so you want to make sure you have that open inside of sub account you want to make sure everything's working your microphone
3:01:50
webcam right have a notepad you can also take these uh online using some kind of notepad tool or anything else like that
3:01:57
and then just relax okay make sure you breathe and then start the call off very friendly hey John how's it going man
3:02:04
how's your day you know make some kind of joke about where he's from or where you calling in from and then just
3:02:10
resonate with him a little bit be a human being don't sound so robotic sometimes inside of our community uh
3:02:15
when people ask me to review their sales calls and we actually go in and take a look on Zoom I see that they're so
3:02:22
robotic they play it and I'm watching the recording I'm thinking dude would you even buy from yourself like you
3:02:28
don't even sound like a normal human being so anyways setting the agenda cool and then just ask him hey is it cool if
3:02:34
we just jump right in people will always say yes and then just go ahead and get started these are good questions you can
3:02:39
ask yourself I'll let you review this document yourself I'm not going to uh read every single one but these are pain
3:02:45
driven questions so what's your process for qualifying buying leads right how do you handle follow-ups with potential
3:02:50
leads and so yes I know it's not necessarily with web design but you can even ask questions that are related to
3:02:55
web design like hey if you saw your competitor's website and yours who would you hire who would you move forward with
3:03:02
ask them obvious questions like this that are pain driven a lot of times they uh don't have a follow-up process or
3:03:08
they don't have a process for qualifying the leads and so forth or when you ask them what sets you apart from your
3:03:14
competitors they don't really know and that's a great thing because it allows you to find the pain and then sell for
3:03:22
that yeah and then here we have some closing notes if there's any aspects of our offer that you're unsur about let's
3:03:28
discuss them now to see how we can align any solution with your needs now again I make this this is a general principle
3:03:35
you want to make this more friendly and also more like natural right this is an exact sentence that I would say but this
3:03:42
is still something that you want to keep in the back of your mind so let's start with the first slide here I always start
3:03:47
with the meeting outline because this shows them what your process is and it keeps them in line with your flow and
3:03:54
exactly what your program is we do your business quick background results decision and then execution so he knows
3:04:02
from the very beginning that he has to make a decision on this call and I love this very important let's dive into your
3:04:08
business so again when we start I want him to talk about his business I want to see where his business is at your
3:04:15
current online presence what happens when potential customers Google you is it easy to find you your online
3:04:20
reputation what's your current review process let's check your reviews so during this slide I am just on a new tab
3:04:26
and I'm just Googling him I'm looking at his website I'm critiquing his website I'm giving him advice on his website I'm
3:04:32
just talking to him like a normal human being and sometimes we'll go off tangent cool man so how many projects are you doing per month like how many new
3:04:39
massage therapy clients are you seeing every single day how many people call you every single day how many of those
3:04:45
go to voicemail how many of those do text back so I'm asking a lot of very good questions along this slide this is
3:04:52
deeply for your clients and you can spend as much time as you want on this slide so don't feel like you have a time limit in fact the more this potential
3:04:58
client tells you about their business the better off that you'll be so let's keep moving here let's look at your
3:05:04
competitors okay Google let's Google your services reviews how many reviews
3:05:10
does everyone else have so this is you going into Google and maybe not necessarily Googling like their business
3:05:16
name ABC Landscaping or ABC massage therapy but you're going to go to Google and just type in massage therapy Las
3:05:23
Vegas right or massage therapy Miami Florida wherever they're located you're going to do that and then click on the
3:05:28
Google my business and just start scrolling down and being like do you see yourself I don't see your I don't see you why is that have You' been in
3:05:35
business longer than these guys right start finding the pain and start showing them that they are nowhere to be found
3:05:43
then we talked about the audit inside a go high level prospecting tool so you can do that here under step three and
3:05:48
then thoughts what do you think do you have a plan in mind how do you plan to get this better right this is asking
3:05:54
your clients hey do you have something in place already the answer is probably no and then they're going to admit that
3:06:01
they need you and that is what we are trying to extract here that they don't have a plan
3:06:08
and they have no idea what they're doing so they freaking need you let's go ahead and keep moving I would put in your
3:06:14
reviews right here so again if you have screenshots of videos or maybe you just have some
3:06:21
people that left your Google review I would just put them in here if you don't have this yet and you are just getting started you're brand new in this process
3:06:27
then just go ahead and delete the slide you don't have to show anything because the next slide is going to be high
3:06:33
converting website sample so these are the website in a day templates that we give you you can keep this exactly as is
3:06:39
Right use these if you have other templates and other samples then feel free to add them in below this or even
3:06:46
replace them this is again fully custom so it it's it's completely up to you what you want to put in there also if
3:06:53
you want to go in and actually like have links below this where you can click into it and show your clients like other
3:06:58
websites that you've done that's cool as well you can do that I've also done that before but I usually wait for clients to
3:07:03
ask me sometimes clients want the in-depth and they want to see live examples and when they do ask then we
3:07:09
show them now we dive into the mechanics how our system works we have the
3:07:14
estimate collection blast build your conversion machine website prove credibility over main
3:07:19
competitors and then capture and communicate with potential client requests in one place now I know they
3:07:25
signed up for like a you know website in a day or even a custom website but I've renamed all of this for example this is
3:07:31
a database reactivation campaign I just call it an estimate collection blast because in my niche of contractors and
3:07:39
remodelers they want more estimates so you can see how I'm speaking their language and this is very powerful and
3:07:46
now they know this is geared towards them so let's keep going next slide is our process estimate collection blast
3:07:52
this is how it works generate projects and collect cash in the first 30 days here's how it roughly works right so you
3:07:58
provide previous customer list or previous list of leads that did not close we send proven email and text
3:08:05
sequences incentivize referrals right we get repeat business you get new jobs or
3:08:11
new projects right sometimes my clients call them jobs within 30 days we follow up and nurture your customer list or
3:08:17
your lead list every 3 months boom and then an average result on what they can expect here's the process build your
3:08:24
high conversion machine website and then lastly we say we follow up and nurture your customer list every 3 months or so
3:08:32
this really depends on how big their list is if they have thousands and thousands of people there's a different
3:08:37
process than if they have a 100 or 500 people and then we give them an average result so let's go ahead and keep on
3:08:42
moving here next is going to be the build your conversion machine website and again this is geared towards them we
3:08:50
don't just say now we build you a website no what's in it for them it's a high converting machine it's a high
3:08:58
converting website so let's keep moving here's what most companies do they have a website or Google page asking for
3:09:04
basic information name email phone no prev vetting to see if leads even need work done nothing sometimes can even get
3:09:11
spam or not work at all you'd be shocked sometimes even on this call like I fill
3:09:16
out their uh their contact form on their website and I show them that it doesn't work I say hey can you find this website
3:09:22
form submission and then I just watch them stumble and they check 10 different emails and then I asked them how many
3:09:28
leads are you missing like you don't even know where to check them right that's a pain Point all these questions
3:09:34
are geared to seeing what they need to seeing the pain to seeing what we can
3:09:40
solve for to seeing the Gap that we can fill there is a book that I love about
3:09:45
sales it's called Gap selling and all it says is widen the Gap right so your clients know they probably don't have
3:09:50
the website that they need our goal is to go in in between there and widen that
3:09:56
Gap and show them they actually don't know anything they actually don't know what they need they don't have a good
3:10:01
process they don't follow up and now instead of them feeling like oh no we're we're almost there maybe we're not at
3:10:07
100% but we're almost there and then you go in there and you just show them look there's so many things and now at the
3:10:12
end of this call they're feeling like wow actually this isn't just like a one small template change that we need but
3:10:18
we need all this right you show them that they are further than they actually think because they have no plan and so
3:10:25
here I am showing that people redirect a contact form into just this message your message has been sent this is how most
3:10:31
people do it this is completely incorrect they're missing out on a bunch of leads by doing it this way if you
3:10:37
don't answer the potential customer calls the next business inside the Google M business so here what I'm selling is called Miss call textback so
3:10:44
for example as soon as they call our client I want them to automatically send a text
3:10:50
to that potential lead or to that potential customer then we show them this main criteria for Success no
3:10:55
urgency call someone else after I haven't seen any any of your reviews or past work or anything like that and then
3:11:01
I show them the high quality homeowners that we get and then we go into our home services closing software you can rename
3:11:07
this to anything you want our masseus you know High converting software whatever your software name is you can
3:11:13
put that in there track all new leads every Source into one platform take advantage of our automated text and
3:11:18
email followup manage and truly understand your new lead pipeline if they are also running ads like some
3:11:25
clients for example are running Google ads or Facebook ads or Tik Tok ads or
3:11:30
maybe they're doing anything else this is an amazing opportunity for you to go in and say how much is Tik Tok
3:11:36
generating you how much is Google generating you okay you're doing some stuff on LinkedIn or on Instagram how's
3:11:42
that working because a lot of times they have no idea so you you going in and
3:11:48
just helping them track different things okay it's game changer for them think about that they're spending money they
3:11:54
have no idea what the return on investment is I had a client that was spending over $20,000 per month on ads
3:12:00
and a big portion of that was on billboards and he had no idea how many freaking phone calls were coming in think about that it's insane these
3:12:06
business owners are out there they need us then I show them this okay team Calendar Book Online automated followup
3:12:13
every message one inbox get more fivestar reviews smart web chat Google my business messaging
3:12:18
so sometimes I'll even ask them hey how many messages do you get on on on Google business and so forth and then I just
3:12:25
watch them as they have no idea typically what I'll also do is ask them
3:12:30
which one sounds the most valuable to you what do you like the most so far out of everything that we talked about
3:12:36
because this is kind of overwhelming and so by asking that question they are giving me fuel and they're telling me
3:12:42
what they like so that way when I go to close that's what I'm focused on the big problem with all these different
3:12:47
features and this and that is people spend an insane amount of time on every
3:12:52
little detail and okay look inside high level what we could do is this and these websites and
3:12:58
automations that's not how you sell any of this you find what they like you find the Gap in their business they don't
3:13:04
have enough reviews just focus on reviews you could charge them 300 500 a month just for the reviews you don't
3:13:09
need all these things so make sure you do that also big key point and I already mentioned this but you should not be
3:13:18
talking 80 90% of this call and just going down the slides like this these
3:13:23
slides are to help you and to steer you in the right direction but this should still feel like a conversation between
3:13:29
you and the client or the potential client rather so that you can turn them
3:13:35
into a paying client and it's too often that all people do is sit down go through each slide they read every slide
3:13:41
and they just it's it's just this one-sided like you're like you're just presenting to a wall and you're just reading % of customers read reviews BL
3:13:48
blo as soon as you're done you move on to the next one and that's not how you do it make this a conversation 90% of customers read reviews look at pictures
3:13:55
of jobs less than 5% of people who view Google business listings uh actually
3:14:01
convert more than ever customers want to be able to text with someone how often do you check your Google Business messages again we're finding the pain
3:14:08
how many lead opportunities are you losing every month using by not using the website chat this will lead to
3:14:14
immediate New Leads now if you already have a go high level
3:14:20
account and you have clients that are onboarded that are using the website chat using the live chat then around
3:14:26
this part I would actually start going into your go high level account in fact around this if they tell me the most
3:14:32
important thing is their five star reviews I will actually go into my high level go into a live client account that
3:14:39
I know that we did the review campaign for and I will show them a live review campaign from an existing client this is
3:14:46
going to be extremely powerful and what this will allow you to do is to sell them without selling because you can't
3:14:53
argue with results now even if you don't have any clients you don't have any results just yet that's okay that's okay
3:14:59
you could just go through these slides and it'll be fine but I promise it will help once you get your first client and
3:15:05
you do your first reactivation campaign you install the website chat and you have live leads from a client that is
3:15:11
getting freaking results and you go in there and you go into the dashboard and you go into the conversations and they
3:15:17
see the tag from live chat and they see that they're actually getting results or even better if they have closed projects
3:15:23
from the live chat you can show them that right here inside dashboard and we have clients that have closed like 50
3:15:29
60,000 from the live chat and I show them that so again it sells itself when
3:15:35
you once you can actually show all that this is a live screenshot from our account this is actually a a real client
3:15:41
so from here we say track everything in one place no more guess works so if they tell me that they are running ads for
3:15:48
anything or they're doing any sort of marketing or advertising even if they're putting up yard signs I tell them cool
3:15:55
here's what we can do we'll use different phone numbers on your yard sign a different phone number for your billboard for your magazine for your
3:16:01
pamphlet for anything else that you do and we'll track it like this you can see here it says Facebook lead form right so
3:16:07
this client specifically we were running ads so we can track exactly which ad it came from but nonetheless if they're
3:16:13
doing Google ads and Facebook ads already go in there and just integrate everything inside here so very easy this
3:16:19
is an automated text message right an appointment reminder and this is someone that is responding and then next we have
3:16:25
the high converting website in a Day package you get a full website that's geared towards sales and helping you
3:16:31
convert website visitors into booked appointments maximize your leads create a strong online presence right always
3:16:38
updated showcasing your best work promoting your services 247 don't just say website tell them what they're going
3:16:43
to get within this website why do they need a website now from here this is
3:16:49
where I recommend that you actually show them the website in a day custom homepage that you built for them and
3:16:56
basically when I say custom homepage I mean you just add their logo to it and that's it right so now you again go in
3:17:01
here you go to the websites tab you take the template that you have uh inside of your like website in a day sub account
3:17:08
here in high level right again you do this before the call you just go in here you just hit clone you put the logo on
3:17:13
top and that's it so you're going to show them that homepage and start start getting their data maybe even compare it
3:17:19
to their competitors maybe compare it even to their existing website side by side which one would you hire which
3:17:26
website looks nicer to you who would you trust more if you were moving forward with this service right ask them these
3:17:32
good questions and then they'll be way more likely to close even if you're doing a custom website I would then talk
3:17:39
about the custom website here and also this slide is usually where I find out whether they want a custom website or
3:17:44
they want the website in a Day package because again even if they're doing the custom website they're still getting all
3:17:49
these other features that we have now really the way we sell the custom website will be towards the end and you'll see how we do that here in a sec
3:17:56
okay build your conversion machine website maximize your website and get qualified prospects reaching out build
3:18:03
build an online brand people actually trust prove credibility over main competitors let's dive into that so
3:18:09
here's the accelerated five-star review machine that we have again look at the different names we're not just saying oh
3:18:15
we do a review campaign oh we just sent some review emails no
3:18:20
this is an accelerated five-star review machine powerful right make this sound
3:18:26
good make this sound exciting generate 20 to 35 new Google reviews in the first
3:18:33
four weeks we can actually do it in the first two weeks honestly I just tell them four weeks and then again I like to
3:18:39
overd deliver and then we do that in the first two weeks and now they love us now they're extremely impressed okay how
3:18:44
does it work you provide a previous C customer list we send proven mail and text message sequences you get positive
3:18:51
reviews coming in immediately we set up simple systems for submitting future customers as well so I want to show them
3:18:57
that yes we're going to collect reviews from your existing customers however in the future we're going to make it very
3:19:04
easier for you to collect reviews you go into our dashboard you just attach a tag that says customer sold or customer
3:19:10
project complete or any tag you can name it anything you want you attach that tag
3:19:16
to that customer and we'll automatically send a review request and also what we do from here is we can even filter the
3:19:24
reviews so if they choose anything less than four stars or five stars it gets redirected to a form that the potential
3:19:30
lead just fills out and it goes to your client's email okay and this is just done via a funnel so this is how it
3:19:36
looks like right here this is the funnel the client has their logo up top if they choose five stars it redirects them to
3:19:41
Google or to Facebook anywhere you want to actually leave a review if they choose let's say two stars guess what
3:19:47
sorry to hear you're not satisfied name email feedback boom just sends directly to the client which saves them from
3:19:52
getting bad reviews and this is what we do if you don't want to use something like this that's also okay you can just
3:20:00
redirect him to Google business I know some people I've seen have issues with this we've never had any problems with
3:20:06
this I've never even heard of someone that has any issues with this so completely up to you how you want to do
3:20:11
that redirect it to Google directly or to our funnel that we use okay our process now we capture and communicate
3:20:18
with all job requests in one place again my Niche calls it job request you could be project request or all massage
3:20:25
requests or all Landscaping requests up to you lead connector messenger app how it works so phone calls text right
3:20:31
messenger everything goes to your app the lead connector messenger app so lead connector it links up to high level this
3:20:38
is what they use and then they get everything on their cell phone they complete a project right and we can even
3:20:44
make multiple users if they have staff or employees that are doing a lot of work they get their own login they mark
3:20:49
it hey this is done boom automatic review request all good very very very
3:20:55
very easy to do and to manage for your clients bonus automated Miss call text back of course this is an amazing
3:21:01
feature we talked about that earlier and this is where I typically talk more about that during the actual sales process so here's our process bringing
3:21:07
it all together rapid job collection blast build your conversion machine website and an accelerated five-star
3:21:14
review machine uh lead connector messenger app and then from there I ask
3:21:19
them what sounds most valuable to you what are you the most excited about
3:21:25
we've covered a lot of stuff here what are you most excited about and then I just go back and forth and I chat with them a little bit right we just covered
3:21:30
a lot any questions so far have you ever tried anything like this every single time people say no because this is
3:21:37
different this is new right they came on here for a website but now they're getting an entire branding package because you have to think why do they
3:21:44
want a website they want a website to improve their online presence all of this stuff genuinely helps their
3:21:49
business and improves their online presence so wrap up right six-month program after that you can opt out any
3:21:55
time if you'd like guarantee ensures that campaign stays on track so for this you can do a three-month
3:22:03
minimum a six-month minimum anything you want 12 month minimum I've seen people doing that this is just a contract okay
3:22:09
it's a minimum and then it goes month to month or they can renew a contract up to you how you want to phrase it I
3:22:14
recommend if you have no clients then do it for three months then your next
3:22:20
client do it for six months and if you're having trouble with that you can even just do it month to month but
3:22:26
honestly this is so cheap you're not like it's it's not that big of a deal clients aren't really giving me price
3:22:33
objections whenever we sell this so guarantees and transparent tracking website and results guarantee if you
3:22:38
don't absolutely love the first draft of your homepage will'll send you a full refund if you don't get any responses on
3:22:44
the reactivation campaign or Google review will send you a full refund now if they don't have a list I don't give
3:22:50
them that um that guarantee meaning if they tell me we have no one we can reach out to we have no past customers then
3:22:57
obviously we don't have this guarantee right and that's not going to work so so we just stick with the um the homepage
3:23:03
guarantee okay website custom website website in a day this is again where I
3:23:08
decide okay what do you want what are you interested in what sounds better to
3:23:13
you what are your needs hey and then I even sometimes even give them a a price range of cool well look honestly custom
3:23:20
websites are thousands and thousands of dollars but they do work very very well so are you more interested in just
3:23:27
getting something that's that's a bit cheaper just having your online presence or do you want something that's custom and unique and you know everything this
3:23:33
and that has all the bells and whistles and a lot of times you'll get hints throughout this call it's not going to be a surprise typically by the 26th
3:23:41
slide here there's not going to be surprises you'll know roughly what they want you'll know their bu budget you'll
3:23:46
know how big the company actually is so you'll know exactly what to sell them so then I asked them where would you like
3:23:51
to go from here so I want them to ask me for the price I never just go into the
3:23:57
price cool so what else would you like to know does everything here make sense
3:24:02
what sounds the most valuable to you I know you mentioned earlier uh we looked at your reviews and this and that so I'm
3:24:08
guessing you want to improve the reviews but um also I'd be curious to know I mean how come you aren't getting the
3:24:13
reviews yourself right now right that's I would recommend you asked that question earlier when we're talking about the Google review campaign and the
3:24:19
program and all that stuff but around this point they should be asking anything else I never go into the price
3:24:26
and you should never go into the price if they have more questions about your product once we know that they are sold
3:24:32
on the product then we go in and we sell them what we have we sell them the service but before then if they aren't
3:24:40
telling you they aren't giving you feedback they're just sitting there quietly just sit here on this slide cool
3:24:45
so what you like to do I mean is there something you want or is there something you don't want like I want them to say
3:24:51
yes I want this and then I and then I'll even dig further okay nice well where do
3:24:57
you think this would help your business the most is it the reviews I mean like what what do you feel how do you feel
3:25:02
this is going to fit into what you're currently doing right I want them to be sold before I go into the price okay
3:25:09
let's keep moving okay pricing website in a day 150 a month again you could change this to meet to meet your needs
3:25:16
you can I wouldn't go less than 100 a month honestly and then 150 seems to be
3:25:21
a good sweet spot you're just copying and pasting a website template and just adding in like an about us image and and
3:25:28
and some content there that you can take from chat gbt but then we have the custom software 300 a month includes the
3:25:34
website so if they sign up for this custom software and you can actually change this to say the custom software
3:25:40
name so this is your version of of go high level right so mine is goet digital
3:25:45
and so what will say is goet digital software and if you want that software plus the website it's just $300 a month
3:25:52
if they say they just want the software and sometimes people are sneaky and they'll say oh I already have a website
3:25:58
why don't I just do the software uh would that be 150 less the answer is no the software is 300 if you want the
3:26:03
software the website's free that's that's that's how it works it's $300 a
3:26:09
month no less than that and you can even charge 500 honestly if you want to upsell them let's say like upex right
3:26:15
like right here manage Facebook ads or maybe they're interested or intrigued in Facebook ads maybe they want to run it themselves or maybe uh they just want to
3:26:22
manage a couple Facebook ads and they want to test it then you know you can
3:26:27
you can include this for500 a month so up to you play around with the pricing what you can even do is
3:26:33
have multiple pages on here like as you can see I have two right here right 28 and 29 you'll see it once you actually download this template um but from here
3:26:41
if they want a custom website I'll just skip over this one and I'll just click right on page 29 here so we do have a
3:26:47
discount available so if you pay for the full six months upfront or whatever your contract is if it's three months um if
3:26:53
it's six months or maybe it's 12 months whatever it is I like to give a discount if people pay upfront not that many
3:27:00
people do it but some do and it's kind of nice then you just get a massive you know check for thousands and thousands of dollars and then you can even give
3:27:07
that um that as a discount so here's the the custom website so custom website okay 6,000 one time and then we do the
3:27:13
custom software at 300 a month but the first month is free obviously you have to talk about hosting and you know
3:27:19
there's more complex things if you're doing custom websites then you already know this like you probably already have a server you're hosting your website
3:27:24
somewhere like I recommend HostGator and you can craft this to be your price even
3:27:30
if you charge less than 6,000 I would actually keep the 6,000 here and I would say look I'll be honest our custom
3:27:37
websites are 6,000 but you know I see this or I see that or maybe you know you said you only need X Pages typic
3:27:43
websites are 20 Pages you only said you need like 10 so I can actually decrease it quite a bit and what we can do is we
3:27:49
can get started for 4,000 does that sound fair enough and then you just wait for them to speak whenever you say the
3:27:57
price do not talk this is the most important part in closing when you say the price cool so it seems to me that
3:28:04
you want the software once they actually agree here that they want the software you could say great so I think this would be the best package for you You'
3:28:10
get the website in a day and the custom software we do have a discount available here as you can see so it's just going to be only $300 per
3:28:18
month and I want you to sit there just sit there and let them Square
3:28:24
them oh okay sounds good but this and that just keep your anwers short keep it sweet
3:28:32
cool sit calmly it's okay to be in the space it's okay to have some silence
3:28:39
some silence this is how you close Okay say the price and shut up that is it I'm
3:28:45
being abrupt now say the price and don't do anything else even for the custom website so it seems like you want the
3:28:50
custom website amazing look most of our custom sites are pretty big and they're
3:28:55
usually 6,000 for yours I know you only said it's about this many pages so we can do it for
3:29:02
4,000 and just sit that's it everyone gets automatically enrolled into the
3:29:08
software like I mentioned at $300 a month first month is going to be free and this is after the the website launches so if it takes you a month to
3:29:14
do the website then you're not going to do anything in high level and then you would launch it um alongside the website
3:29:20
right and if you want to do some kind of discount you can also do that that is going to be personal preference so as
3:29:26
you can see we pretty much have everything covered here in the slides if you have anything custom though then feel free to add it just do not go far
3:29:33
into the weeds and make sure that your client is actually speaking to you and this isn't a one-side conversation now
3:29:40
again if you want to download these slides and use everything go inside of our course here you can hit classroom
3:29:45
right here go into the web designer course and by the way we also have way more down below this you can you can go
3:29:51
in and uh check those out once you're inside the community uh if you alter this slide I would recommend you jump on
3:29:57
our um our live call so we have calls every single day that are live so jump on there and ask me for my opinion on
3:30:04
your slides uh and just show me some of the stuff that you tweaked because it is important that they are still high
3:30:10
converting and they still have and maintain this core message so go in here hit this it should open up in a new tab
3:30:16
once you have it just hit file at the top left there hit copy don't request this from me hit copy paste it into your
3:30:22
own Google Drive account and you can edit it from there all right so let's go ahead and dive in so the past couple
3:30:29
calls we've covered a lot of stuff how to design this business model and how to structure the entire company and then on
3:30:36
day two we covered how to actually get clients so if you follow all these things you will get clients you'll get a
3:30:42
lot of interest so now what happens after you signed a client I just signed
3:30:48
someone now what so let's dive in here is what we are going to cover what
3:30:53
happens after you sign the client we'll cover the onboarding process here we'll
3:30:59
cover the website in a day program how to actually build the website in a day
3:31:04
we'll cover the custom website process we'll cover how to optimize and automate
3:31:09
everything here how to upsell monthly services so they keep paying you forever
3:31:15
cuz at the end the end of the day you just get a one-time fee up front that is not good enough we are trying to build a
3:31:22
long-term business project management and how I've managed hundreds how I've managed hundreds of websites at the same
3:31:28
time hiring vas Outsourcing and reclaiming your time I will give you
3:31:34
exact Sops and exact assembly line process that you can follow as well and then even next steps and how to scale
3:31:40
past $20,000 per month in profit most bottleneck around3 to 6,000 per month
3:31:48
from my experience and then also throughout the training we'll be putting in links in the slides you know tools
3:31:53
free website Imports all of that but if you wait till the end I'll be giving a bunch of free resources to everyone to
3:32:00
the public as long as you have a high level account you can hit import it'll be imported into your account so let's
3:32:06
go ahead and dive in so what is the process we covered this previously and this is now covering the second half of
3:32:13
this process right after you sign a client how do we actually upsell them how do we onboard them so let's dive in
3:32:19
here's the goal the goal here is to create Sops sop stands for standard
3:32:26
operating procedure and the reason we want to do this is because this will
3:32:31
allow your business to scale I can show you how to onboard clients today but if
3:32:37
you don't have a scalable process then you're always going to be busy and bogged down by tiny little details so
3:32:43
what we want to do is set this up correctly from the ground up and this will work for you whether you don't have
3:32:49
your first client or maybe you have 50 clients or maybe you have 150 clients this is stuff you can start doing today
3:32:56
the earlier you start implementing this the better now as you do tasks in your
3:33:01
business you want to record them I like using loom.com but really it's just a screen recorder I think there's like
3:33:07
free Chrome plugins that you can download that will record your screen I think even Mac has a built-in screen
3:33:13
recorder and later the goal of this is to hand this off if you hire a virtual
3:33:19
assistant they can take over look at exactly how you do tasks and replicate
3:33:25
that because you have a video of you doing it so it's just as good as you sitting next to them and showing them
3:33:32
hey this is the best way to do it except now you can do it virtually in a scalable way and once you do this
3:33:39
process correctly you you're going to have a resource library and this is
3:33:44
important because any new hire any new virtual assistant or anyone else that you bring onto your team all you have to
3:33:49
do is give them the videos that you already recorded So it's very easy and there'll be a perfect fit into your team
3:33:55
so you want to think assembly line where every person has a task even if you don't have a team this will just in
3:34:02
general help you organize things and then you can hire easily so if it's just you you still want to follow this
3:34:08
process because it'll give you a nice checklist so you're not waking up and thinking okay what did I say to this
3:34:14
client what stage is he in in and just it removes any doubt and any uncertainty
3:34:19
that you might have in your business you want to leave the freelancer clients only want me mindset
3:34:28
all web designers completely mess this up they live in this mindset do all the
3:34:33
work yourself I'm the expert I'm going to do all of the work imagine if lawyers or plumbers thought this way imagine if
3:34:41
a plumbing company with tens and 20s of employees right imagine you called him to fix your toilet and the owner the CEO
3:34:48
of the company came how far would he be able to grow his business five people a day four people a
3:34:55
day that he can see right no you pay him right so we just had recently some
3:35:01
Plumbing work done and it was like A1 $150 for a guy to come and fix something
3:35:06
I'm willing to bet he's paying his employees $3 $40 $50 per hour so he's making a lot of profit and this is how
3:35:13
we want to operate and by the way I'm talking to myself here for years I did
3:35:19
this I followed this path I tried this that's why I know that it doesn't work
3:35:24
and it's only when I started pivoting out of this mindset that I started seeing success so you want to create a
3:35:32
perfect balance of having a boutique small business owner agency in the beginning while Outsourcing as much as
3:35:39
you can you can hire virtual assistants for $4 to5 per hour and they will work
3:35:45
out hourly as you scale up they should be helping you with all
3:35:50
of the backend services so you can add time back to your day this is roughly
3:35:56
how it should look and by the way when I mention this the $45 an hour some people think oh
3:36:02
that's so low no one's going to work for that look I live in Colombia right now
3:36:08
and I was at the gym and I was talking to a guy that had perfect English I'm talking perfect English and he was
3:36:14
working at a call center making like 100 150 cold calls per day for this business
3:36:20
he was working in he went to college he has a four-year degree can't remember in what but he ended up graduating good
3:36:28
college good University and he was making like $450
3:36:33
$460 per month that was his salary he had to drive to work sit in traffic so
3:36:41
by you paying someone $4 or $5 an hour you're already giving them a arrays but
3:36:46
also making their life better because they can work remotely and by the way I pay my team much more than this but if
3:36:52
you're hiring someone in the beginning that's just starting you can start here and also you have room for raises for
3:36:58
room for improvement these are normal people that have real
3:37:03
skills so the assembly line imagine if I'm going to get my mouse over here
3:37:10
imagine if you had a person let's say here we packaging phones imagine if you
3:37:15
you had a person that was grabbing a phone grabbing a box and then running over here grabbing a box from the other
3:37:21
room and then packaging up this phone himself and then running over to the other side of the room or the warehouse
3:37:28
putting on the shipping label putting on the the uh all the Post-it notes and
3:37:34
just adding in everything himself and then handing it over to the mailman himself how long would it take to ship
3:37:40
out one phone a very very long time now imagine if you had like in image here a
3:37:46
person that is just putting together the boxes right then you have another person
3:37:53
that just has a box of phones and he's putting the phones in the boxes and this person is packaging them in the actual
3:37:59
box that is going to be shipped down then you had another person that's putting on the shipping label and then you had another person that's actually
3:38:04
giving it to the mailman how many phones would you be able to package and ship out in an hour in a day way more now
3:38:13
here's the big benefit you don't have have to hire full-time employees so if
3:38:19
you're small you don't need to hire all these five six employees right away you
3:38:25
no longer need this you can hire these virtual assistants that are very affordable from other parts of the world
3:38:32
and have them work per hour this is very powerful this is very
3:38:39
powerful because it now allows you to only pay them as you have work as you
3:38:44
get clients as you have projects you pay them so you have a virtual assistant
3:38:50
here as soon as you get a new client it's like a new phone let's say for this example they can go in install the
3:38:57
website template they can add their logo at the top right if you're doing custom websites they can sit there install WordPress for you right build the
3:39:04
foundation of how you want the website to even look like what theme to use they can do everything themselves then you
3:39:09
have a copywriter a Content writer again that you pay hourly that goes in and just replaces all the content on the
3:39:15
website so by the time you see it everything's installed it's all unique content it's all organic content it's all done you just take a look maybe make
3:39:22
a couple tweaks and if there's a couple errors then of course you can walk around and you know talk to that
3:39:27
employee and tell them what they can do to improve so now you have a proper
3:39:34
business you have a business that you can scale up and if you don't have any clients then you're not paying
3:39:42
fees so let's dive into the welcome email let's dive into this onboarding
3:39:47
process into the start of this assembly line so let's look at the welcome email
3:39:53
that we have now the welcome email is going to contain the onboarding funnel link and this is the exact one that I
3:40:00
use welcome this is the subject line your onboarding form I'm so excited for
3:40:05
you name so excited for you Bob below is the link for the onboarding funnel and then I put in parentheses will take a
3:40:11
few minutes to complete I did this because I noticed that when I did that people just took more time to fill it
3:40:16
out and they just answered it better and they were more prepared for it you're going to drop in that link and don't worry I'm going to show you everything
3:40:22
I'm going to show you all the questions we ask during the onboarding I'll show you everything I'll need a few additional details however the form
3:40:28
above will cover the majority of their requirements and we can start building on our end please complete this ASAP so we can get started looking forward to
3:40:35
helping you crush your goals get more jobs and grow your company now when I say jobs this is equivalent to saying
3:40:42
projects or um basically more clients in
3:40:47
my niche in my space that's how they talk and then this actually isn't an image this is a gif so in their email
3:40:53
it's a gift of a baby basically celebrating I do this again just to provide just to give a uh a friendly
3:40:59
atmosphere and a friendly environment to my clients and also I'm just more laid-back so um that's the kind of
3:41:05
relationship that I want to have with them so let's go into the next slide
3:41:11
here so we have the onboarding funnel so page one we have the form we we have the Google Drive creative
3:41:17
link and so we get them to fill this all out we get them to upload all their all their photos and then they go to a
3:41:23
scheduler meaning they schedule their onboarding call with us automatically we
3:41:28
book The onboarding Call 3 to 5 days with the zoom link let me show you what I mean first page funnel landing page we
3:41:37
have this video page I'll talk about that in one second here's the calendar that they book now again it blocks it
3:41:44
off for 3 to 5 days all depending on your process and how long it takes you if it takes you a day to build this website this website in a Day template
3:41:50
you can unblock it for a day right so they can so they can't book it same day maybe they can't book it tomorrow but they can book it in two days so you can
3:41:57
create that and embed that inside the calendar we typically just do five days and of course if it's a custom website
3:42:03
you might mean more so you can adjust that as you like and then once they fill that out it goes to a thank you page and
3:42:08
I'll show you all of these in real life now this video page is optional let me
3:42:14
briefly talk about why we have the video page so after they fill out this onboarding form it asks them everything
3:42:21
that we need and then it redirects to this video page and what you can do here if you'd like is just help build your
3:42:27
brand a bit more and say hey I'm so excited that you fill this out super exciting here's the next step in our
3:42:32
process you're going to book in a time we're going to go over X we're going to go over y by the way you need this and so you can kind of just talk a bit
3:42:39
further now the way that we used this video is I actually told my clients to
3:42:46
film on their phone on their iPhone a thank you page
3:42:51
video now what this actually is is again we're overd delivering for the clients on the client's website
3:42:58
form as soon as someone fills out the information sometimes we redirect them to a calendar so they can book an
3:43:04
appointment like we talked about in the previous calls other times we redirect them to a thank you page now what does
3:43:10
everyone else in the space do every other website that you've seen typically you you fill out that form and a little
3:43:16
message appears little message box hey thanks for submitting we'll be in touch with you shortly is this really the best
3:43:23
message to send people I think not and so what we do for our clients is we tell
3:43:28
them to film a video and imagine if you're let's just stick with landscapers because that's what we've been talking about in the past couple days and
3:43:35
imagine if you're landscaper had a video after you submitted the form and he says
3:43:40
hey what's going on I'm so excited so again he's holding his phone like this it's holding it sideways he could be standing on a yard on a on a lawn on one
3:43:48
of his client backyards and he's just filming saying hey thank you so much for submitting your information I'm super
3:43:54
excited to get started working with you whatever you might need whether you want us to mow your lawn maybe you want us to
3:43:59
install some plants around your yard maybe you want us to add some rocks or maybe you don't even know what you want you want us to design your entire yard
3:44:06
I'm super excited to get started and actually meet with you to come out to your property again this is no obligation I'm happy to give you my
3:44:13
advice on all the Lawns that I've seen and what I think would look good in your property anyways thank you so much for
3:44:19
submitting your information go ahead and book in a time right now so I can actually know when I should call you by
3:44:25
the way I'm going to be texting you so look out on your phone and again this is all automatic right so now the automatic text messages sent now the calendar
3:44:32
links sends to him and he's prefacing this lead so do you think do you think a
3:44:40
client's going to be happy with that process do you think that is going to help him convert more of his website
3:44:45
visitors into actual paying customers of course of course and I don't have to do this this is harder for
3:44:52
us right this is more work for the client but I know how powerful this is and again we're overd delivering here
3:44:57
and that's kind of the the theme hopefully that you've been catching on is we want to overd deliver and provide genuinely an amazing service that helps
3:45:04
them get more customers and make more money so that's what they do sure go ahead us S interrup Help Us
3:45:12
understand here how long did it take you what what uh what obstacles have you go through to really perfect this I mean
3:45:19
you're giving a finished product very generous of you you're walking through in detail but what was that Journey
3:45:25
looking like of getting this far and what should our what should our
3:45:30
receiving audience expect with customization and patience and really implementation because you made it look
3:45:37
easy but not everybody's at your lovely yeah so actually and and it's funny because clients also don't know exactly
3:45:43
what to say so we actually give our clients a script so in this video If you see I'm uh I'm going over a document so
3:45:48
we give our clients the the script of roughly what to say it doesn't have to be perfect having any videoos better
3:45:53
than having no video honestly it came from a lot of trial and error again I've worked I've managed hundreds of websites
3:45:59
at the same time and I I don't mean like these website in a day websites some of them were these templated websites but
3:46:05
most of them were custom WordPress websites and I've just seen the analytics on the back end we had this
3:46:11
one client just had a lot of videos and we just one day just put put the video on his thank you page and then all of a
3:46:17
sudden he was getting more replies on his leads and I was wondering well why why is that he's getting just as much
3:46:22
traffic as this other client why is he doing better is he just a better business owner is he better at sales is he better at X is he better at Y and
3:46:29
then I realized although he might be better at sales he was just wasn't scared of filming videos and so now we
3:46:35
tell all of our clients to do it and the cool thing is everyone has a smartphone so you give them a script your clients
3:46:41
aren't going to be against this idea it might be uncomfortable for them but no one's be against the idea of hey I'm
3:46:47
going to make my leads more qualified because at the end of the day it's true right if you're potential if your customer your clients call their leads
3:46:55
and call their website form submissions and they already know what their face looks like what their voice looks like
3:47:01
they're way more likely to sign up so and especially if you're working with like a chiropractor or like a massage
3:47:06
therapist imagine if you had a video that that it was maybe like a quick tour hey what's going on thanks for submitting your information I just want
3:47:12
to give you a quick tour of our massage studio of chiropractor clinic this is our you know this is this expert this is
3:47:18
that expert like that'd be cool you feel like you're building a relationship now let me actually show you what some of these look like I'm sure some people are
3:47:24
curious well what questions do you ask on the onboarding form and so forth so let's actually take a look so this is
3:47:29
the onboarding form again you're going to just put your logo at the top boom name company name I'll let you take a
3:47:35
look at this and screenshot it if you like uh we also have a Google creative folders for example clients have a bunch
3:47:41
of images I used to sit back and forth trying to email them and this and that just have a button opens up a new Google
3:47:47
drive folder all the clients can import all their photos that they want on the website in here and then literally they fill this all out the whole idea with
3:47:55
this process is as they go through once they go through this process and hit this thank you page you have all the
3:48:00
information that you need you have everything so we want to automate a lot of this then what happens is they go to
3:48:07
the video page but again that's optional but you can just redirect it to the calendar page as well if you'd like and
3:48:13
this is what it looks like here so you're going to have the calendar below uh it's not pulling my calendar since this is on a demo account but looks very
3:48:20
simple nothing crazy there and then the thank you page has your logo again it says you're
3:48:27
booked it pulls in their name we look forward to speaking with you then we've emailed you confirming the day time and
3:48:33
then of course talk soon it be your name and then also your agency name right here and then FAQ right what do I need
3:48:39
for the call we use zoom so you can just tell them to install Zoom if they don't already have it and then what do I need
3:48:45
you can make you can customize this yourself right so that is the process
3:48:50
automated okay contract signing so how does that work everything is going to be inside of go high level contract go high
3:48:57
level sign feature this is how it looks we actually just had it here so let me
3:49:02
show you what that looks like if you are inside high level you can go under payments and then right
3:49:08
here documents and contracts click this you hit new and we usually just upload a PDF since we have all our contracts in
3:49:15
PDF form and then it will tell you that it'll ask you to put in fields just
3:49:23
like this and you're just going to drag it and drop it name company signature and now they can eign it electronic
3:49:29
signature boom all done all inside high level okay now you're going to add this
3:49:36
client inside of clickup so what is clickup clickup is a tool that we use to manage everything I'm going to show you
3:49:43
that in a second and you're going to add in all of the details so once you open it up you're going to have a tab that
3:49:49
says client management and then once you actually open that client you'll have all of the checklists let me show you an
3:49:54
example of how this is going to look so once you load this up and you make an
3:50:00
account it's going to look like this you're going to have clients and then we also talked about doing internal Sops
3:50:05
right standard operating procedures this you can build out with time so this is
3:50:11
an example right so you go in here you can have recording and you know here's tutorials on how to send emails you know
3:50:18
so again this is for outreach so if you're automating reaching out to different people then you can have
3:50:23
tutorials on that Outreach scripts our sales process everything right how to do Facebook outbound everything so but this
3:50:29
is the more right like how to edit content and how to uh install a website form how to embed the code how to
3:50:35
install live chat so you can give this over to your team this is what it looks like under clients so you get a new
3:50:40
client and it should look like this and right here you again you can automate
3:50:46
this process as well where you can use zapier to link that form so when someone fills out a form it automatically pastes
3:50:53
all their information in here but right now what I do is when someone fills out the form we actually uh I email my
3:51:01
assistant he gets all the form questions he automatically goes in his first task is to go inside clickup add him as a
3:51:08
client and the way you do that you hit add task right here and then it gives you something below boom you can put in the client's name and then he goes in
3:51:14
and he pastes all of the client details inside of here as a comment and then he Imports these checklists so as you can
3:51:20
see you want everything with checklist this is the biggest life hack send client welcome email boom done send
3:51:27
contract inside a go high level done again check it off like this import all information uh into clickup from the
3:51:34
onboarding form done create client Discord channel so what we do is we used to use slack we use Discord now for all
3:51:41
of our clients uh I found that works just as well and it's free so we just
3:51:46
create a separate account on Discord or slack and it's just for that client so we can just talk about that client we'll
3:51:52
talk about the web design launch process here in a bit so let's dive back into the slides and I'll show you the other
3:51:57
checklists here soon okay website in a day buildout here's what you're going to
3:52:03
do you're going to create a new sub account inside of your high level you're
3:52:08
going to import our website snapshot or create your own again towards the end
3:52:14
I'm going to give you you a website a a template that you can take you can import this allows us to copy paste
3:52:19
websites in all the settings very easily right so where are the custom values
3:52:24
custom values change the entire website easily I also have other custom websites uh or other custom values that I've been
3:52:31
experimenting with when it comes to Colors so you go under custom values you type in a new color and it changes all
3:52:38
the colors on the website that's still in in beta phase so I won't show that but it is possible you can automate this
3:52:44
with the SAS plan so again I think I mentioned this in day one but you can to have all of this automatically imported
3:52:50
if you're on the SAS plan and they check out on your homepage of your website and so you want to shoot to get everything
3:52:57
done here in one to two days especially if you're just importing it so if you
3:53:02
imported let's say a snapshot then it can be inside here
3:53:09
it'll be inside websites and again if you're just showing it on a sales call then I just
3:53:15
have one sub account for everyone for like demo presentations but if you're actually making it for the client you
3:53:20
want to take the main one so we import it right here it'll say the client's name in the top left and then you have
3:53:26
the main one you can go in and start editing the website right here right you click into it you hit edit boom edit in
3:53:32
a new tab and then now you can change and edit everything so let's go ahead
3:53:38
and keep on mve in here okay finalizing the actual website so let's talk about
3:53:44
the web site content you can use the same content on all of the pages for the basic plan so if somebody's paying us
3:53:50
$150 a month that's not an SEO package it's not a Content package and I know
3:53:56
what some people are thinking oh well what if one client sees the same website as another client so that's never
3:54:03
happened that's never happened to us before because we work with clients all over the US okay and also by the way I'm
3:54:11
willing to bet if you sat down and you looked at a bunch of people's websit ites you'll realize that a not only do a
3:54:16
lot of other agencies these massive companies do this exact thing and they install the same template for all their
3:54:22
clients on a basic level plan but also how many original ideas can you come up
3:54:28
with if you change images and if you just change how it looks like there's only so many ways that you can make a
3:54:34
website especially if it's for this basic plan if they pay for a custom site make it all custom you know do this and
3:54:40
that but if someone has any objections upsell them the custom website this is a
3:54:45
basic plan we're not optimizing for SEO or anything else we're just getting something up they can have linked to
3:54:50
their Google my business and trust me I've actually seen these websites with the same content rank because they're in
3:54:56
different cities and they're they're still ranking on Google even though we're not fully optimizing it it's not terrible for SEO and you could throw in
3:55:03
like basic onpage optimization again you can customize this to whatever is that you want you can throw that in add like
3:55:09
a setup fee 500 a th000 you know for basic SEO uh upfront
3:55:15
so change this for each client uh you want to change the pictures and the business bio on the about us page so
3:55:22
obviously the about us can't be copy and paste I also just recommend you change the photos on the homepage definitely
3:55:28
the about us and maybe even some of the service Pages you can even have like a gallery page if you want and then swap
3:55:33
those photos that doesn't need to be custom for the client but again if you have a virtual assistant all they're going to do is go to that Google drive
3:55:39
right that we had the client upload all their photos and you're just going to take photos from there if you want custom content you can either write it
3:55:46
you can hire someone to write it or just use chat gbt so for my assistance we have prompts that are inside of clickup
3:55:53
right inside these dropdowns prompts that we give that they can say hey this is the client details and we literally
3:55:59
just put in their onboarding form into chat gbt and you can say act as a copywriter for a website give me content
3:56:05
around X around Y and it'll give you content so install live chat all the
3:56:12
contact forms should be go high level and you also want a tracking number we just use tollfree because it's very easy
3:56:17
to get approved um with a2p and then later you can switch it to a local number if you want so again if you're
3:56:24
doing a custom website use the contact forms inside of go high level also use the live chat feature we install this
3:56:30
for everyone again you want to assume even if they just paid for the website in a day you want to assume they want
3:56:36
the SAS plan and just automatically enroll them into SAS I suggest creating this once and
3:56:43
everyone gets the same content on unless they pay for SEO meaning if you're working with landscapers build one
3:56:49
website in a day website for landscapers the same content obviously you can build
3:56:55
out all the different Services maybe not every client does all those Services maybe one client doesn't do lawn design
3:57:01
another client does do lawn design so you could just hide that page for that client but have a master template and then just give them all the same content
3:57:08
so that way you don't have to redo it every single time so onboarding meeting for website and a day clients so you're
3:57:16
going to be showing the website so the goal of this meeting right so this is after you build it again couple days
3:57:23
later or if it's a custom website could be a week later the goal of this meeting is to get domain access so you can
3:57:29
actually launch the website this could be name cheap GoDaddy if they don't have one then you can just purchase a domain
3:57:36
for them we always do this on the client behalf I don't want to own their domains I just have them share their
3:57:42
screen like I'm doing now they go into name cheap and they buy the domain then
3:57:47
you link it to go High Level under it's it's under settings domains very easy to find you just link it to high level and
3:57:53
then it's officially launched and live on his domain you're just going to attach it to that
3:57:59
funnel now you want to collect past leads also on this call so past leads
3:58:04
they never closed or even a past customer list so again it depends on
3:58:09
your industry but let's say you're working with a landscaper and they have
3:58:15
30 website form submissions on their website per month so let's look at last
3:58:21
month they had 30 people reach out and I would ask him how many of those 30 people turned out to be customers if
3:58:27
they say 10 okay great you have 10 pass customers you have 20 people that you never closed that's what I mean now this
3:58:34
is easier for some Industries more difficult for others but I would import everyone and also some Industries you
3:58:41
can reactivate their old customers so so let me give you an example massage
3:58:46
therapy I would just get or chiropractors I would just get one giant list and I would do a reactivation
3:58:53
campaign for all of them and then I would get another list that's just definitely their customers and then do the Google reviews campaign for them if
3:59:00
you're a roofer I wouldn't take past customers of roofers and try to sell them a new roof because if they fix the
3:59:07
roof 6 months ago one year ago chances are they probably don't need necessarily a new roof but you can still reactivate
3:59:13
people that they never Clos people that reached out a year ago or 6 months ago that they didn't actually turn into a customer that still makes sense and so
3:59:21
again they just signed up for a website package but you're going to do this to overd deliver then you connect you
3:59:26
connect everything to go high level so if you hit the Launchpad at the top of go high level I'll show you what that
3:59:33
looks like right here you hit Launchpad and you just connect all of this okay so
3:59:38
again if they're on WordPress you can connect that here but connect the Google my business the Facebook the messenger
3:59:43
if they're not using stripe no problem but connect everything and when you do Facebook it'll do Instagram as well so
3:59:51
that's going to be huge you want them to download the Go High Level app so on the App Store it's
3:59:57
called lead connector and I think it's on that Launchpad as well and have the client download this because this is how
4:00:03
they're going to check on their business when they're on the go when they're driving when they're doing anything they
4:00:08
they should definitely have it on their phone and where they can respond to all the messages and you can show them hey this conversation's t all your Facebook
4:00:15
messages all of your Instagram messages they're all going to go here no longer have to open up 10 different apps to
4:00:22
send messages and then also on that onboarding you want to send a test text
4:00:27
message so they see that this is real and they can see that in real time type something in hit send it'll go to their
4:00:33
phone they'll respond and they'll see that it happens in real time and appears in the dashboard they just love it I
4:00:38
mean it's kind of common sense for us that this works but they just love it if it's the first time they're seeing it they're going to get excited about it
4:00:44
so about goad level don't ask them again next part of our this is the way that you're going to phrase it so the next
4:00:51
part of our process is connecting everything to our dashboard so you can check your contact forms your leads your
4:00:57
calls and website performance everything in one place and it's true they can if
4:01:03
they are even just doing a website right you go in here you can go Under reporting you can check their calls you
4:01:09
can check everything we want to help them track everything so assume the sale automatically onboard them into
4:01:16
everything SAS if they want changes on the website if it's website in a day upsell them the custom website 4,000
4:01:23
5,000 $6,000 so let's talk about custom websites custom website buildout so I
4:01:29
picked 5 to 10 themes that I loved on on theme forest I used to do all of my custom sites on WordPress and so I'm
4:01:35
glad you mention that because we have a lot of that so let me show you theme forest and again if you also don't know
4:01:40
much about websites the best way to learn is just go into a a Marketplace
4:01:46
like this like theme forest and just look at what's high performing look at
4:01:51
what's selling out look at what themes people love cuz if 26,000 people love this theme and they all have a five star
4:01:58
rating it's probably a pretty good theme and it's probably a pretty good look now even if you're not purchasing these themes if you just want website ideas
4:02:04
you want to see what a nice website looks like the these are literally people raving about these websites like if you want to become a better web
4:02:11
designer if you want to become better at design look at what these guys are offering look at their designs and just
4:02:17
start asking yourself okay cool I kind of like this element here I like this here I like this there and so forth so
4:02:22
you can learn a lot by just going into these and again you have live previews so click into the live previews of all of these and just explore it so and at
4:02:31
the end of the day if you're doing the custom websites and you are using Wordpress then I picked I had 5 to 10
4:02:38
themes and even my custom websites were kind of templatized they weren't fully custom I used the theme and then I built
4:02:44
off that theme so I picked one uh for a client here's an example of one of my
4:02:50
actual websites that I used for a client of course I changed all the addresses and names and phone numbers so this is
4:02:56
all like dummy text and this is an actual live custom uh website well it's not live again because I replaced all
4:03:02
the stuff but I did use this for a client uh the only thing that we had on the client is we had the website form
4:03:08
right here on the top right so you can see that's empty field we had a form and
4:03:14
as you look at it it looks quite nice right it's we have a good attention to detail here with the lines here we have
4:03:19
nice icons uh we have their testimonials and by the way you can integrate the the
4:03:24
highlevel testimonial Builder and it will automatically populate this with the newest reviews that they get on
4:03:30
Google as well and so we have it all built out we have a gallery they can go through all of this right uh I typically
4:03:38
like to uh add a little bit of humor on the website so I'll put like cups of coffee or something like that to uh be a
4:03:44
little bit cheeky there and then yeah so there's a form and then we have a couple more testimonials and then that is the
4:03:49
website and then when it comes to the dropdowns again when it comes to the this is all about conversion so as you
4:03:55
can see this is highlighted free andural consultation we have that there five star rated company we have the phone number as you scroll down in the bottom
4:04:01
left we have this this highlevel live chat widget on every single website this
4:04:06
is amazing as well and all this is it doesn't even have to be a live chat this is just a another version of a website
4:04:12
form that's it and it goes into their dashboard into your dashboard then under
4:04:18
Services of course we have different pages and everything for whatever it is that they offer so this is an example of
4:04:25
a website that you can build always embed the Google my business because it also does help with um SEO so when
4:04:32
you're doing this I noticed the chat widget on the bottom um you mentioned the embed form so the real power of the
4:04:39
website for those that may not be familiar with the strategy they understand the con just not the detail
4:04:44
strategy you want to embed the form fills you want to activate the chat maybe activate the conversation
4:04:51
AI um add the calendar feature um like you said add the Google business profile
4:04:58
map in there maybe add the uh testimonial um feed from the reputation
4:05:05
management so you're adding these features right yes to take time but that's has that worked best for your
4:05:12
clients yes 110% you always want to add in the email field but this is how you would do it you would go under here boom
4:05:18
chat widget you do this and then once you hit save right there you get the code you just paste the code and then
4:05:24
you have it across the entire website so very very easy to do same thing with the forms you just hit Builder and then you
4:05:29
just get the code and you copy and paste it there it is and you could even choose if you want it to be uh right live chat
4:05:35
you could choose you know different AI stuff and this and that we just have it be an SMS just because it's it's just simple but that's apprciate showing the
4:05:43
simplicity of it because you know it's easier said than you know for many easier said than done but you're doing
4:05:48
both you're talking about it with confidence because you've done it but you've also coached others but now you're showing like look click here
4:05:54
click there and you're everywhere so I appreciate that exactly exactly
4:06:02
now the way that I would do this is I would assign all of this technical stuff to a va va is a virtual assistant have
4:06:09
them install everything if you're doing the custom website then they should be the one that is
4:06:15
installing the WordPress theme have them add the dummy text VA adds everything go
4:06:20
high level they gener they create the form on High level they embed the code they embed the live chat they add the
4:06:27
surveys the calendars everything they should be taking care of this now if you want to make things custom you can do it
4:06:34
now so maybe add sections and and and so forth and now you need content so let's
4:06:42
talk about how to actually get content so this is a live search that I did on upwork I like upwork they have reviews
4:06:48
they have a bunch of stuff maybe some of you have used this before as as someone that's looking for work I've only really
4:06:54
used this as someone that is hiring so I think it's uh it's another point you can
4:07:00
hit up sign up and then you can choose your category but go ahead and type in something like website content writer
4:07:06
and you will find people that will literally write content for your entire website look at their job success look
4:07:12
at how much money they earned chances are it's probably pretty good and you don't even necessarily need people that
4:07:17
are us-based if they have a good job success score and they've earned a lot of money then people probably like them
4:07:24
look at their reviews and just scroll down and you can see the fees $15 an hour $35 an hour right $15 an hour 35
4:07:31
you can even find people in the states right us $35 an hour and I know that might kind of seem like a lot oh well
4:07:37
it's 35 an hour or $50 an hour but it's really not they're writing content on your entire website if you're doing
4:07:42
customs you're charging four five $6,000 so you're charging 6K for them to just
4:07:49
write content across the whole website if it's a more simplistic website like this that has you know Services all of
4:07:55
this it's not going to cost that much the whole thing is going to be less than $1,000 and they will have done all of
4:08:01
the work so you're pocketing still 5,000 and then maybe Outsourcing this for a
4:08:06
th000 and that's expensive by the way they should be done in half a day a full
4:08:11
day so depending on what their hourly rate is I mean it should cost you $3
4:08:16
$400 to get content for the entire freaking thing 500 600 again all depends
4:08:22
on who you hire and so that's how you can do it I would suggest uh you hire a few and then work with one that you love
4:08:27
that has great reviews just hire a couple people have them do different things some people are more responsive than others some people take forever to
4:08:33
respond some people are very quick so just find someone that you like work with them consistently and again you're only going to pay them as you have work
4:08:39
so you don't need a full-time employee so now let's cover how do you actually find a website copywriter So Below this
4:08:45
video I'm going to have a link to upwork the way you're going to do it is you're going to post a job right here well first you have to make an account uh
4:08:50
make a business account and you will be assigning people projects so I would suggest that you choose shortterm right
4:08:56
here that way it's kind of like per contract I already created a template so I'm going to show you what that looks like but you're going to start with I
4:09:02
want to create a new template and I'm going to give you this template also below this video so you can copy and paste it into your own and really at the
4:09:09
end of the day this is all that you need you know you can add whatever you want and I even included like a standard project looks like this right a thousand
4:09:15
words about Roofing Services roof repairs flat roofs roofs with shingles and so forth right uh we give them the
4:09:20
business name we give them the phone number here's a dummy website and so forth and then they just go from there um you can adjust your hourly rate to
4:09:28
whatever you want I mean obviously if you pay more you'll probably get a higher quality um person and someone
4:09:33
that's more experienced and then you know maybe they'll even know like some copywriting principles and so forth so you can also do it per thousand words so
4:09:40
I've done that before as well hey I'll pay you $50 for th words versus $20 an hour to write something I like the per
4:09:47
project as well um you play around with both and you can see because honestly I Haven I don't really care how long it
4:09:53
takes as long as a thousand words get done but typically I mean you know it shouldn't take that long to to write
4:09:58
that much so there's that scope I would choose medium uh worldwide is what I select there so budget $10 to $20 you
4:10:05
can do more like I mentioned previously uh and when you're setting up your first profile it's not going to look like this
4:10:10
this is like an already done one it'll look more like this you you'll just have to copy and paste it uh and then you'll
4:10:15
be all good these are just my settings this is very important for the screening questions uh make sure these are not
4:10:21
optional so these have to be um required and if someone doesn't fill these out
4:10:26
then just don't even bother interviewing them like they're they're not a good fit you want two main questions so one is
4:10:32
describe your recent experience with similar projects right so you want them to put that in and then you want to include this question right here
4:10:38
important we will not look at your application without this please send us a loom video link of you talking to your
4:10:45
camera and sharing your experience your life work experience Etc around one to two minutes please this is really just
4:10:51
to vet out the people that are skimming through these job applications and just spamming the apply on every one that
4:10:56
they find um and then you want to have a second question link the Articles or anything you've written that relates to
4:11:01
our job posting um so yeah and then you can check this off as well if you'd like so let's go ahead and keep on moving so
4:11:08
what I typically do English English level conversational or better uh I don't really choose a Time requirement
4:11:15
since it's not like a it's not a job you can say more than one person or one
4:11:21
person I just keep it more than once that way it allows more people to keep on applying even if you hire someone
4:11:27
because in the future you might get someone else that applies that's really good and then the second website or third or fourth you could just test them
4:11:33
right so you just test it that's really the key to a lot of this is honestly hiring a bunch of different people and then just giving them actual live
4:11:39
projects so if I were uh doing this again today and I didn't have anyone I would just hire like three people like
4:11:45
if you have like three content projects or maybe you have one website that you're doing I would just hire different
4:11:51
people one for the homepage one for the you know different Services pages one for this service page one for this one
4:11:56
and then just see who you like talking with see who's faster uh see who responds better and and so forth so
4:12:02
let's keep going uh job post preferences so I've messed around with invite only
4:12:08
because sometimes when you choose all you get a lot of applicants that just aren't qualified
4:12:13
but this is certainly not a bad way to start because you can vet them out um if you do invite only then what you have to
4:12:19
do is like like we just talked about you have to search for the website content
4:12:25
writer and then you have to specifically invite them meaning your job is not public and only the people that you
4:12:30
invite can actually see your job but um yeah if you're just starting just select
4:12:36
include anyone um you know search engines all that stuff and I've also paid for this to boost the job's
4:12:41
visibility and this does work if you need some ASAP you can also pay for this if you'd like like if your client just
4:12:46
paid and you just want to get this done ASAP you know just pay someone again this is you know these are clients that
4:12:52
are paying you thousands of dollars so it's it's not a it's not a huge chunk that we're putting in even if it's a
4:12:57
couple hundred dollar for Content so yeah that's that and then you just hit post job so very simple very easy to do
4:13:04
this now what does this actually look like once you hire someone once they give you some sample work that they like you want to make sure that it's not AI
4:13:10
uh generated and the way that you can actually do this is you can go into chat GPT and then tell jat uh ask chat GPT
4:13:20
was this generated by AI take the content paste it in there and chat gbt
4:13:25
will tell you so pretty simple there now what does this actually look like in
4:13:30
practice so this is what I typically do this is let's say you have a homepage done right so you have a homepage you
4:13:36
have a bunch of dummy text right so you have Lauren ipsum this is just Latin just dummy text and you're going to give
4:13:42
your contract the URL of the website so it would be so we typically use subdomains like I showed you in this one
4:13:48
right here so here's our subdomain on top of our lit media development again if you're just doing this inside high
4:13:53
level and you're doing this inside of like the website in a day you could just paste like the the public uh preview
4:13:59
link so it could be you know app.you agency uh right so it' be your
4:14:04
agency.com whatever you set up as like your your white label domain and yeah just give them the link that high level
4:14:10
generates for you and then what they're going to do is they're going to go through the entire website and
4:14:16
screenshot it like this and then create new content for you this is an example this is a slider and so you see my
4:14:22
content writer went in and took a screenshot of the slider it gave me okay
4:14:27
Kitchener modeling slide boom kitchen or modeling and then refurbish your old look into a classic one into a classic
4:14:33
One S the brand new installation or mix and match boom so now you have content right and we have a second slide for
4:14:39
bathroom remodeling now we have this section right here and if you notice this is uh a very similar template that we're using on here boom so now free
4:14:47
quotes and estimates right so that came in included and then that says lauram ipsum there so that's all dummy text as
4:14:52
well and now they gave us content that you or your editor your virtual assistant can go in copy this and paste
4:14:59
it inside of this section same thing with the second one a locally owned locally owned this is the content boom
4:15:06
so let's keep going so now there's like a welcome section so you scroll down right this is like the the welcome section um and you can put in boom
4:15:13
welcome to blank we are blank right so that could be underneath it that could be like a subject line or it could be
4:15:19
part of the uh the actual content there it is right as you scroll down we have a bunch of their project projects and so
4:15:26
yeah so this website template is a little bit different we switched around a bunch of stuff but nonetheless if this was all Laura myum then your uh your
4:15:32
client would go in and then they would replace okay our projects right are this are that and then they would give you
4:15:37
content that you can use for every little thing so again screenshotted
4:15:42
content placed all good there it is right here's a bunch of content and here so this was an SEO client and so what we
4:15:48
did was we needed a th words on the homepage and so we just have like a bunch of bunch of client here A bunch of
4:15:53
bunch of content here below this Gallery so that's going to be there and so as you can see boom bunch of content right
4:16:01
all good all in there nicely Laura msum and then feel free to contact us if you have any questions comments anything so
4:16:09
ideally this a very long document but ideally what you do is you send they fill this document out to you you see it
4:16:16
you just simply take this you give it to your virtual assistant and then they go through it and they put in all of the
4:16:22
content that this writer just wrote for you and they paste it right they paste
4:16:27
it or if you're doing a custom website and it's your design no problem give them a link to your design with the dummy text and they're going to write
4:16:34
everything doesn't matter if it's custom websites or you're building it you know on WordPress Weebly uh not Weebly web
4:16:40
flow um don't use Weebly uh web flow anything else any other platform doesn't
4:16:46
matter this is the general concept screenshot content below it right so very very simple uh we typically do this
4:16:52
first on the homepage the client sees the homepage they approve the design they approve some of the content and um the direction that we're going in then
4:16:59
sometimes I will say you might have to go in and just make it sound a little bit better right or replace certain
4:17:05
things or you know adjust certain things and and that's okay once you actually work with a Content writer that you know
4:17:11
like and Trust will get better and better and better and better so don't be scared if right out of the first you
4:17:18
know page of content that they give you is not perfect just give them some feedback big thing is we don't want Ai
4:17:23
and this has to be organic if you're doing SEO if you're charging for custom websites and that sort of thing so hope
4:17:30
that's answered any questions that you have around hiring someone it's a pretty simple process but extremely extremely
4:17:36
effective give them the client onboarding form give them the existing site that your virtual assistant right
4:17:42
here created or if you don't have one yet that you created right give them the WordPress theme give them or even your
4:17:48
go high level theme right go inside your account and just give them that website and say hey all of this content needs to
4:17:54
be replaced and now they know what they have to replace and they will do everything they'll go over the entire
4:18:01
website and replace all the homepage content in a Google doc so in this
4:18:06
section of what we're doing eventually you want them to do the whole website but in the very beginning you want them to just do the homepage because I
4:18:14
typically go over the homepage first I do a meeting with the client so this is just for the custom website by the way I
4:18:21
will do the first meeting just going over the homepage and the theme and I just show them everything because I
4:18:26
don't want to build an entire website and then have them tell me actually I don't like how this looks and then we have to switch to a different theme so I
4:18:32
show them the homepage we have all the content on the homepage and then you go and you build the rest so this is how it works then right
4:18:39
so you do that you just do the homepage onboarding meeting for the website client now you show the website so the
4:18:45
goal is you show them this homepage that you built and say from theme forest maybe it's a go high level homepage maybe it's whatever you collect your
4:18:52
past lead list again as we did in the website in a day you collect the Google reviews list you connect everything to
4:18:58
go high level again don't ask just say this is the next part of our process we're going to connect everything so you
4:19:04
can check all of your website forms your leads your phone numbers all your calls everything and then once homepage design
4:19:12
theme is approved proved meaning they like it they say hey cool this is a good theme keep going then the copywriter writes content
4:19:19
for the rest of the website so just to clarify you sign up a client 5 days later you show them the
4:19:26
homepage if this is a custom website once they approve that then you book
4:19:31
another meeting so you can actually build out the rest of the site or you don't even have to book it you could say great this usually takes two weeks I'll
4:19:37
let you know and we'll schedule meeting once we're done so you don't have to set that third meeting so again a sign sign
4:19:42
the Google Doc to your VA to replace the content um to the upwork contractor
4:19:48
they're going to go to the rest of the website and replace all the content add relevant icons and images and everything
4:19:54
else you're going to review it first but once you actually trust them you don't even really need to uh review all the
4:19:59
different pages like once you find a good upwork person that will write the content quality that you want and that
4:20:05
you're used to and you know that they're going to be picking good images and good everything you don't necessarily have to do much else so you may go back and
4:20:12
forth a few times maybe tweak things yourself if you're an actual designer right like you might want to have a say
4:20:19
in the design and you want this and you want that that's great go in at the very end and even train your designer train
4:20:25
your virtual assistant on your style and how you like to do things or maybe you can always have a last finishing
4:20:31
Finishing Touch on the things that you like and it could be it could be your thing that you do if if that's something that you take pride in and and at the
4:20:38
end of the day these are expensive websites that we're selling so you should be happy with them as well final
4:20:44
custom website meeting so once the website is 100% done you're going to show the client the
4:20:49
website and launch it live on their domain usually they give us access to the domain but I like it again to be on
4:20:56
their own account I want them to own the domain go so the go high level WordPress
4:21:01
hosting is going to be a great option for you if you're building WordPress websites um we used to host everything
4:21:08
back when we did hundreds and hundreds of websites we hosted everything on HostGator so I like that platform as
4:21:13
well and you can still integrate it with highle uh using the forms and the embed codes and all that stuff so email or
4:21:20
call the client once live so as soon as this website is live on the domain email them wow your website's live so excited
4:21:26
you know hype them up a little bit then you're going to run the database reactivation campaign and the Google reviews campaign you're going to run
4:21:33
both we want to get them as quick of wins as humanly possible imagine your client is really excited they have a
4:21:38
brand new website what do they want on that website right they want to see action they want to see action so by
4:21:44
doing the database reactivation by emailing and texting all their old leads and customers their dashboard is going
4:21:50
to start filling up and they're going to instantly feel good inside and hopefully even make money from it more often than
4:21:57
not if they have a good list or at the very least get a bunch of reviews they'll be very very happy with that and
4:22:02
even though it's not directly linked to the website that's still linked to you and they'll be very happy with you cool
4:22:08
rough time frame two to three weeks but we can tell client takes a month and then overd deliver so I always tell them hey for a custom website it's going to
4:22:14
take a month to get it live we've gotten it done because you're systematizing everything like this and it's not just
4:22:21
you building the entire freaking website and trying to put it all together like
4:22:26
that image that I showed you earlier you're running around and putting the phone in the box and this and that we have people doing everything you can get
4:22:31
it done in two weeks if you really want and then we just overd deliver tell them hey man what's going on it's done it's
4:22:37
been two and a half weeks right and then now again they feel good so set the expectation overd deliver okay upsell
4:22:44
meeting so typically 2 weeks after after this period after this point you want to
4:22:50
get on and see how they like everything see how they're using it and then start upselling so after you run the Dr
4:22:56
campaign and Google reviews that's when you're going to chat with them right you want to see and then you want to jump on
4:23:02
zoom and ask them how there how have the results been have you got more Google reviews and sometimes they don't know so
4:23:09
you can just show them look and if you want you could even take screenshots take take a screenshot before and take a screenshot after look at how many
4:23:14
reviews you had before we got started look at the reviews now you literally doubled your reviews you went from 20 to 47 reviews show them that show that
4:23:22
right in their face review results of the campaign go over the leads that
4:23:28
responded go over all the leads inside of the conversations tab inside of high level ask them how they like the system
4:23:35
right ask them if they're using the software and the Unified Inbox hey so how are you liking it how are you using
4:23:41
the mobile app because some people people will genuinely say oh I never use it you'll run this database reactivation
4:23:46
sometimes and clients have no idea like they're getting email notifications every time someone responds right maybe
4:23:52
even the the app is putting notifications on notifications on their phone but they just ignore it it's crazy
4:23:58
so you want to follow up and make sure that they're seeing everything and you can do this by also checking their high level account and seeing that that
4:24:03
they're actually responding to their website form submissions that they're actually calling these people you want them to use this we're helping them
4:24:09
build a habit this is how they're going to stay paying you is if they're actually using it so you want to show
4:24:15
the other features do it live with them on their business so on this meeting again we didn't even talk about social
4:24:21
media posting or any other feature that we have inside of high level like the invoices and all that stuff but do this
4:24:27
with them now right so make a social media post I love doing this everything's linked now make a social media post and launch it to all the
4:24:34
social media platforms and watch them be amazed again we're just overd delivering and overd delivering and overd
4:24:39
delivering for the client that they're going to think wow this is really cool I can make posts on everything this saves me a bunch of time also show them how
4:24:47
you can use AI to automatically respond to reviews it's literally just a checkbox
4:24:53
if you go under reviews inside of high level and then it just says AI uh review
4:24:58
response you're going to check that off and automatically responds to all their reviews because a lot of times they don't have time to do this show the show
4:25:05
the auto AI review messages if they sent make sure you show that to them make sure they have access to the mobile app
4:25:11
make sure everything works and they know how to use all of this so very simple it
4:25:17
might kind of seem like a lot but I promise once you do this stuff one time I learn best by doing so if if you're
4:25:23
confused trust me just go through this we have this all checklist we have this all um sopd out so you can go through
4:25:29
and actually do all of this clients are always going to want more from you don't
4:25:34
always listen because you know best as the expert don't make every single change that they request and Mark all
4:25:42
the changes inside of clickup this is something that I was not taught as a web designer but if you've been a web
4:25:48
designer and you've been signing clients on for websites or honestly any kind of freelancer work any maybe it's graphic design maybe it's
4:25:54
anything that is design it's tough because sometimes clients ask for things
4:25:59
that are just dumb they just don't make sense or they look ugly or they it's just it's and then they don't even like
4:26:06
it that's the best part so something I learned was that sometimes you have to
4:26:11
say no it's okay they paid you but they also paid you because you're the expert
4:26:16
imagine if a roofer came to your house and he did something on your roof and you're like no no no I don't like it I
4:26:22
don't like I don't like it that way don't put the roof together that way and then what happens a rainstorm comes and
4:26:27
your roof is leaking and now there's a puddle on your floor why because you told him to do it your way is the roofer
4:26:33
going to listen to you no he's going to do it the way that he knows is right so you actually get the maximum benefit of
4:26:39
that roof and that is how we need to view this let me actually show show you what clickup looks like so this is the
4:26:44
same clickup page that we talked about earlier let's go through so this is the
4:26:49
web design and again every single client right this ABC Landscaping every single client you're going to import this
4:26:54
template you hit use template and you just import it boom it's all in there so we have create go high level sub account
4:27:00
and this is just reiterating everything that we just mentioned purchase the toll-free number add custom values right
4:27:06
change content replace images SMS email campaign Google reviews page uh create
4:27:11
the website form live chat set up the triggers test test the lead so again
4:27:17
this is what we're doing before we even show the client the website and this is what I hand off to my assistant my
4:27:23
assistant goes through and checks off every single thing here and as they do
4:27:29
that as you can see right we checked this off 42 minutes 42 minutes ago it tells me when they completed these tasks
4:27:36
so now also I know and you can set up notifications hey my assistant completed this and now you're notified client
4:27:42
onboarding zoom boom so show the client the website link everything show client the dashboard uh link up the credit card
4:27:49
for SMS and email so we didn't even talk about that but you can link up your clients's card so every time they're
4:27:54
sending emails and these SMS messages you're actually making profit like you're upcharging for the SMS and the
4:28:00
email so if they don't have a website you purchase the domain right or link to an existing go high level ask for the
4:28:06
lead list customer list all that stuff right have client install this and anytime your client wants an update I
4:28:11
just put it in here anytime the client wants anything anytime there's a change anytime this that anything whenever the
4:28:18
content writer comes in and writes content that document everything goes in here so now we have a nice timeline
4:28:23
right with the exact date the exact time on when things got added when things got changed when things got created and
4:28:30
every client gets one of these now everything is super super organized so
4:28:36
with that in mind let's keep going along here so how do you actually
4:28:42
scale this business how do you do this in bulk so if you're doing custom WordPress websites I used to use this
4:28:49
great tool I actually still use it to manage all of the custom uh WordPress websites that we have it's called
4:28:55
managewp you install this and you can essentially update all of your plugins on every one of your WordPress
4:29:03
websites on every one of your WordPress websites update everything all at once
4:29:09
within this one plugin you just check it off you hit update updates all your WordPress plugins updates all of your
4:29:14
WordPress themes updates everything and then the other cool feature here is the calendar so this creates daily backups
4:29:22
of your WordPress website so if anything ever goes wrong it gets hacked all I do is I go to this calendar I just choose a
4:29:27
date before it got hacked or before something went wrong or sometimes clients go in there it's crazy it's it's
4:29:32
just insane to me they go in there they start changing things and then something breaks and then you have to just revert it this is what we use we also installed
4:29:39
tool that's a part of this it's called uptime monitor and it just monitors if the website ever goes down if it goes down it notifies us
4:29:46
and also sometimes when you update something something breaks and then it notifies you as well so this is how I was able to manage hundreds of custom
4:29:53
websites at once when they were paying us every single month so there's a tool okay let's talk about actually hiring
4:30:00
virtual assistants so everything that doesn't involve talking to clients should eventually be outsourced and I
4:30:07
recommend doing this as soon as you can because you can pay people hourly you want your time you need your time we're
4:30:13
not building this right most entrepreneurs or most
4:30:18
Freelancers that are quitting a job they quit a job that's 40 hours and then they
4:30:23
start freelancing and now they're working 80 hours to escape that 40 hour job it's insane right you want to work
4:30:30
on your business not versus in your business everything backend outsourced building the websites outsourced website
4:30:37
changes updates outsourced this especially the only part that I can kind of understanding I can resonate with
4:30:43
like as an actual website designer is is the design part maybe you have your
4:30:50
touch maybe you pride yourself in how you design things and you know you truly are an expert I love that that's amazing
4:30:57
that was me and I understand so you want to have your virtual assistant do everything and
4:31:02
then you do the finishing touches before you assign it to the content you do the finishing touches you design on top of
4:31:09
what they installed for you hopefully that makes sense but everything back in high level should
4:31:15
also be outsourced all the workflows the automatic text messages the emails the the setting this sub setting that
4:31:21
everything virtual assistance next prospecting messaging your ideal
4:31:28
clients setting up new email accounts for sending creating new social media
4:31:33
profiles for messaging these ideal prospects that we previously talked about in your actual list that you have
4:31:41
right putting together these lead lists for you they could be the ones logging into your your outs scraper account your
4:31:47
lead sourcing accounts and generating these for you using these lead scraper tools and talking to Fiverr sellers even
4:31:55
I give them logins to my Fiverr hey use this to verify Mist right use this tool
4:32:00
use this and that I can manage my entire team now with just voice notes this is
4:32:05
how you're able to travel full-time or just in general work less right if something comes up I can open up or
4:32:12
Discord or slack if you're using that and just send a voice note hey do this do that talk to X talk to Y you know
4:32:18
find this person find that boom and it gets done and they're doing it all for
4:32:24
you they're responding for you so anyone that shows that they're interested you can also have them
4:32:31
respond so if they have a lead list they're reaching out to your ideal clients anyone that responds they could also respond and even book them as an
4:32:38
appointment on your calendar if you get someone that's more qualified they can even call people if they have great English what is the best way to hire a
4:32:45
technical virtual assistant that is what I'm going to be sharing with you here today we're going to outline job
4:32:51
postings where to find them and how to even test them before you hire them so let's dive in first thing you want to do
4:32:57
is click the link below this video it's going to be a job form on Google so you can create this anywhere you'd like but
4:33:03
honestly just Google forms just work so well it's so simple it just doesn't fail
4:33:08
allows you to make spreadsheets very easily so go ahead and just do it in there I'm going to link up two of mine
4:33:14
as well that I use we're going to be talking about go High l/ website in a day as well as a web design assistant
4:33:21
like an actual right WordPress web flow kind of expert could even be like HTML CSS anything applies to anything so
4:33:28
let's go over the go high level assistant job application so what I want you to do is use this as the actual job
4:33:34
application okay when you go and when you post in groups when you post in this and when you post in that make sure you
4:33:40
use this as the if you post inside of a Facebook group this is what you're going to post now anywhere that you post we're
4:33:47
going to talk about a couple different platforms upwork uh Facebook uh or any other platform we always send people to
4:33:55
this form and we actually tell them hey anything outside of this form we're not going to consider the only way to apply
4:34:00
is with this form you want everything centralized if you don't do this people are going to start dming you on upwork
4:34:06
then they're dming you on Facebook and then on Instagram it just it doesn't work trust me keep it all in one place
4:34:11
because you're going to get a lot of freaking applicants so let's dive in this is what it looks like uh name email how many years experience do you have
4:34:17
now unfortunately there's no way for me to just give this to you to import into your account so I'll give you a link and you can just copy and paste my questions
4:34:24
inside of here just take note of what's a long answer and what's a short answer very easy to do this you just go in here
4:34:30
and you can just hit this plus icon it'll create a new question right and then you just choose what it is that you want short answer uh paragraphs long
4:34:36
answer I like to just make all of them required just to keep it real simple so how many years of experience do you have
4:34:43
list your previous experience and go high level uh link your funnels websites you've built right and then important
4:34:48
this is one of the most important steps and this is where they're going to send us a loom video we want to see what they
4:34:54
look like we want to see that they have a good internet connection and that they actually speak English because ideally
4:34:59
they don't have to be perfect in English but ideally they understand English so well that you can send them a voice note
4:35:05
and this is how I operate if I'm out and about right if you're traveling if you're doing this or that or sometimes you're just so busy in your day you're
4:35:10
doing a bunch of stuff all you could do is just send a voice note then you want them to be able to pick up on what
4:35:15
you're saying with your voice and then just do it and then they just send you a screenshot hey it's done right like how
4:35:21
nice would that be you don't have to sit there typing everything out voice note done that is how I essentially run um
4:35:28
all the all the businesses so there's that uh what is your per hour requested pay so for the go high level assistant
4:35:34
honestly $4 $5 an hour is what you want to be paying um these virtual assistants
4:35:40
I think that's that's more than good good enough you can go up to like $6 an hour you'll get some people that apply ask for 10 15 20 even $50 an hour these
4:35:47
are people that are us-based they're I mean maybe it could be worth it if you need something super super complex but
4:35:52
in our situation you don't need anything crazy so uh they're updating like the um
4:35:58
website in a days or maybe they're helping you build workflows or integrating Zoom or like doing really anything go high level related for your
4:36:04
clients they can even import the uh lead list they can run your database reactivation your Google reviews
4:36:10
literally everything back end right this is all on them uh where in the world are you located can you work Us hours um
4:36:17
when we need when we need you in case something breaks Etc this is important I never used to do this because I just wouldn't care until something broke for
4:36:24
a client and my assistant was nowhere to be found so uh this is also important especially if you're looking to hire
4:36:30
someone full-time in the future when would you like to get started and then any questions you have for me so as you can see this is very uh highlevel
4:36:37
focused and the way you are going to use this and share this is you can hit send up here you're going to hit this little
4:36:43
icon right here and then you just hit shorten URL just cuz it gives you something that is much nicer and then
4:36:49
you can copy it and let me show you what that looks like pasted boom pasted and now here it is so again
4:36:57
uh you have the job application and then this is where they fill it all out and then once they hit submit it's going to go into your account here under
4:37:04
responses now what I recommend you do is also you click this button right here and it says link to sheets and what it's
4:37:10
going to do is it's going to make you like a spreadsheet inside of your Google Drive and automatically everyone that
4:37:15
applies is going to be automatically added to that spreadsheet so all you have to do is just add like a bookmark and this is what we do I just add in a
4:37:21
bookmark at the time that I'm hiring and then just to this one uh spreadsheet and then I just check it whenever you're
4:37:28
ready the next day a couple days later and you just have a nice list of everyone so you actually don't even have to go back to this page that's also what
4:37:35
makes it so so easy so let's talk a little bit about so again this is go high level as well as the website in a
4:37:40
day program I recommend anyone gets this kind of assistant even if you have one
4:37:45
client two clients three clients it's still worth it because we're paying per hour right so if your client pays you even $150 per month or uh $300 a month
4:37:54
or maybe you're already making $500 or $1,000 a month just get this person they handle so much stuff off your plate and
4:37:59
it allows you to be scalable so you're not working inside the business but you're working on the business so next
4:38:05
one is the web designs this is custom web design so this you're going to have to if you are offering custom websites on webflow WordPress then obviously you
4:38:13
have to go in update where it says WordPress and so forth and then also slightly answer these questions it's very similar to the one I just showed
4:38:19
you because it still is a technical role so list your previous experience in WordPress the more you write the better what have you done what have you created
4:38:26
you know link your previous funnels websites you've built inside of uh WordPress and then also we want a loom
4:38:32
video and also on this loom video that we have on go high level I added you know share your screen and show us the
4:38:38
workflows that you have actually built we want to see that they're actual experienced people what is your per hour
4:38:43
requested pay so for WordPress you could find someone I mean I pay my WordPress guy also like $5 an hour so you can
4:38:50
definitely find someone that is uh from a part of the world where that's that's good money and they'll be happy to take
4:38:55
that as um as payment so where in the world are you located can you work Us hours and so forth right so these kinds
4:39:02
of assistants can handle things like website updates your client text you hey can you replace this photo or like we
4:39:07
mentioned with the writer right they can take the content from a from your cont content writer and actually paste it on
4:39:13
the website this makes it so so scalable so let's keep on moving and also same
4:39:19
thing here right link to sheets and so forth boom you can get the link by hitting send so where do we actually
4:39:25
find people first place is I would say upwork this is a good place especially for like web designers uh there's a lot
4:39:31
of people on here and what I like about upwork is it just kind of takes care of everything and you can just see their past um job success you can see their
4:39:38
past projects and it's just very transparent the other methods I'm going to show you do absolutely work but this
4:39:44
is nice because it everything is just very upfront it's just upfront and it's in your face like how much do they want they want $10 an hour and by the way
4:39:50
just because it says like $10 an hour doesn't mean that they won't accept less or it doesn't mean that they won't ask for more but you can see kind of like
4:39:57
stuff that they've done and what people have rated them so it kind of preets them prefilters them because this person
4:40:03
uh said they paid him $200 for a go high level setup okay cool right so you onboard a new client you need some advanced stuff boom this person has
4:40:10
worked this person has done this and so it just preets pre-qualifies and it's
4:40:16
the same process if you haven't seen the uh job writer post then you can watch that for like a more in-depth like how
4:40:21
to post the job tutorial but you just hit it's very simple you just hit post the job and then you just take the job
4:40:27
description that we have up here and then you can simply post that um yeah so go through look at the job success look
4:40:33
at how much money they earned look at like what they're requesting I mean this is kind of nice five bucks an hour as you can see and so
4:40:40
forth so should be all good there if you need something that's like WordPress or
4:40:45
web flow or any kind of coding just go ahead and type that in right uh type that in and you'll find people in here
4:40:51
and you'll see how much money they've earned and their success and just their Past reviews like I mean this one's pretty good like I mentioned five bucks
4:40:57
an hour right $4,000 earned and again don't expect everyone to be perfect right out of the gate because they're
4:41:03
also adjusting to you and kind of what you want um but if you're just you know giving them very much so like copy and
4:41:09
paste things to do like hey the client wants this image replaced with this image that's so easy they should
4:41:15
absolutely be um that you know they should be more than capable to do that and the cool thing about upwork as well
4:41:21
is they have to they actually track their time inside of upwork as well they have their own like time tracker and
4:41:26
also you don't have to deal with payments like you know you pay upwork directly and then they pay the contractor so everything is just very
4:41:32
transparent it's in one place so I like upwork um a lot a lot of people in
4:41:37
WordPress for sure so that is certainly one place um also like I mentioned before drive everyone they'll they'll
4:41:44
apply inside of upwork but you want to include a link to this application below
4:41:50
okay so go in and let's say this is your application link okay shorten it
4:41:57
copy at the end of your post just have it show up like this because we want them we want to see who actually reads
4:42:04
our description and actually fills out this form and that's how we're going to reach out to people now I don't really
4:42:09
reach out to them via email if you're hiring from upwork I just message them right within upwork and I just keep everything inside of upwork but that's
4:42:15
just a good litus test cuz a lot of people they just won't submit this video I don't know maybe they have trouble downloading Loom maybe they don't want
4:42:22
to show their face or their voice and to me that's a red flag so I don't even interview those people no matter how
4:42:27
good their projects are so that's just me okay next one is going to be Facebook so Facebook groups are amazing uh high
4:42:34
level job Network I'm actually going to link this group up as well for you uh and I'll link up of course upwork and
4:42:40
everything else here but this is the official job Network so as you can see a ton of people in here so whenever you
4:42:47
make a post I mean you'll see a bunch of people commenting and responding and and whatever right full-time go high level
4:42:52
assistant need is perfect right and and by the way if you need more like job posting uh recommendations or not just
4:42:58
recommendations but like more ideas on what you can Outsource just go inside this group and just look at what people
4:43:03
are posting and as you can see boom ton of comments a ton of people applying so
4:43:10
go in and post post if you need snapshots this is also a pretty decent place to go in and ask for different
4:43:15
snapshots or different niched stuff so funnel everyone into the uh the Google
4:43:20
forms link that I sent you so the um the next place this is more for
4:43:27
fulltime so I actually haven't hired anyone that I pay per hour off of uh
4:43:33
onlinejobs.ph this is all like Filipino employees but it still does work very
4:43:40
very well for full-time work the problem if you're trying to hire someone full-time is these guys on Fiverr like
4:43:46
if this person has made $4,000 on upwork and then you interview them and then you tell them hey I'm going to pay you
4:43:52
full-time you know $600 a month they're not going to want to shut down their profile they already have a good profile
4:43:57
they're probably getting a lot of projects from this profile and so if you're looking for like full-time full-time you want someone literally
4:44:03
like on the clock working for you 40 hours I wouldn't pick it from upwork I would choose someone um from
4:44:09
onlinejobs.ph cuz it also is transparent and it shows you exactly what they're asking for right $800 a month WordPress
4:44:16
expert go high level so this is cool if you're doing uh WordPress and go high level then here's one guy that can do
4:44:23
both right so yeah go through and type it in and uh same thing you can go in
4:44:29
and type in WordPress in the search bar and whatever these are all Filipino people just so you know so if you're in
4:44:35
the US or whatever their time zones are completely different so make sure that they're okay with working US time zones
4:44:40
so that is uh the other uh the other site that I have in
4:44:45
mind um I've hired from other platforms like LinkedIn as well but I think for
4:44:50
this for the purpose of what we're talking about for anything technical I would stick to these main sources the
4:44:56
three sources depending on what it is that you're looking for and by the way it doesn't mean that you can't find someone that won't want full-time work
4:45:02
because some people are annoyed by the ups and downs of freelancing and so forth um but start with upwork and go from
4:45:11
there now how do you actually interview them right so let's say you're in a situation now to where you have 100
4:45:17
applicants you have 50 applicant so what I would do is I would just set up the meetings and the interviews back to back
4:45:24
so what I mean by that is take your favorite ones watch all their Loom videos and then just you know schedule
4:45:30
like if you get a 100 like schedule like 10 interviews and just do like quick 15
4:45:35
minute 20- minute interviews and just schedule them back toback just make a calendar inside a high level and just interview all of them but the biggest
4:45:41
litus test with all of this is them actually creating something that is the
4:45:47
most important thing here that we want to know so interview them and just chat with them very very briefly just make
4:45:53
sure that they know what they're talking about and you can actually have a conversation with them but more importantly than that I recommend you
4:46:00
always pick three people and hire three people per hour okay this is how I've hired every single almost every single
4:46:06
person on my team I make them I hire a couple people and then I pick one or two uh the most of the time just one
4:46:12
especially if I'm hiring for a full-time role this is the best way to do it because you don't actually know what someone's like until you actually start
4:46:19
working with them like they might have all this great experience and they sound good and maybe even the interview they
4:46:24
crush the interview but then when it comes to building it takes him like five days would it takes someone else one day
4:46:30
to do that's what you want you want speed as well and the best way to do that is to just make them a sub account
4:46:36
so every single if you're hiring a technical person um you what you're going to do is make a account for each
4:46:41
and every single person and just label it by their name okay says after the
4:46:47
interview you pick your top three people label that sub account and give them a task like just give them a task hey I
4:46:52
need this or if you just want website updates give them a website that's incomplete and just say hey make this
4:46:58
into this and and by the way I pay everyone for this interview process again if if it's per hour it's four
4:47:03
bucks an hour it's not that big of a deal it's a onetime fee because of course you are even if you don't hire
4:47:08
the people that you paid that's fine uh they're still working so you should pay them for their time although other
4:47:14
people have offered to do it for free I just still pay them anyways cuz it's not it's not a big deal to me and I think
4:47:20
that is the best way to do it and get them all inside the sub account and say okay this is the task and you can just film like a loom video like this and
4:47:27
just tell them what the task is and just you know go inside of a sub account and say okay do this do that do that you know show them this show them that hey I
4:47:33
need a workflow that does this hey this isn't working hey build this workflow from scratch right or do this and that
4:47:39
is how you're going to see if they are a a true expert if they can properly do it inside the sub account the way you're
4:47:44
going to add them is if you go under uh settings and then you can go under my staff all you're going to do is just add
4:47:50
him as an employee and just give them access to this one sub account and then you're just going to have them log in on
4:47:55
your url here at the top using their you know their email their whatever and then they have access to that one sub account
4:48:01
if you're hiring for like custom websites then it's essentially the same thing except if it's for let's say
4:48:07
WordPress you're going to give them WordPress logins to to that website that you want them to update and uh have it
4:48:13
be a subdomain so I wouldn't give them like a live client account but I would make some kind of subdomain some kind of
4:48:19
demo website some kind of anything right just install a brand new WordPress website and then say hey this is I want
4:48:24
this theme and I want it to look like this for this client and just see what maybe they could do themselves because you'll be shocked some people will
4:48:31
underperform so greatly where literally they can't even import like a freaking theme like it's so easy and then other
4:48:37
people will overd deliver and they'll likey you know choose uh they'll understand some conversion optimization
4:48:44
and then they'll even change up some images or they'll say yeah and actually I took this form and and I know that
4:48:49
this form should belong up here so I moved it like this then I customized it like this and so you'll just be happy with it so that is how I recommend you
4:48:56
hire I think the biggest mistake people make when it comes to hiring these like technical experts is they don't actually
4:49:02
go in and assign them a real project so there's two main things they don't actually assign a real project for them
4:49:10
to work on before they officially hire them or they just hire one person and
4:49:16
they're like okay cool uh this guy sounds good right they they make one post inside Facebook they get uh 10
4:49:22
people that respond you know two people DM them they they find one guy that's just you know sounds good he sent him a
4:49:28
website that they like they hire that one person okay cool you're not my guy right or my girl that that that is
4:49:33
editing all this technical stuff for me and then they start working with them and then they're just they just don't do
4:49:38
a good job they're not up to par they're not up to the standard that you want them to be maybe they just don't understand your voice notes which I like
4:49:45
doing everything in voice notes like I mentioned I think it's the quickest way to do it and then you can also do it on the go right just on your phone so
4:49:53
that's the way I I chat with everyone inside of Discord so I just get the uh the assistant that I that I hire I just
4:49:59
add them on Discord uh I have the Discord app on my phone uh we'll go over Discord in a different module but that's
4:50:05
how I do it and then I just talk to them all in there and then if they have any questions they ask me on Discord also keep all the communication in one
4:50:11
channel even if you don't have Discord right now and they're applying all inside upwork just keep all the communication inside of upwork and then
4:50:17
when you finally pick those three then you move them over to Discord and just uh chat with them there so that's how I
4:50:24
do it hopefully uh that helps you and hopefully that that all makes sense this is the best way that I have found I've
4:50:30
tried like everything and I don't even see trainings like this um online but that is how I hire that is how I find
4:50:37
good people and by the way maybe in the first round you don't even find someone that you like that's okay don't give up you know go to upwork and boost that
4:50:44
post maybe you have to pay a little bit of money to boost that post or just go through more pages and just start inviting people into your projects right
4:50:51
into your job and these people will apply um and then you can filter out
4:50:56
from the best just because you you know the the first person you hired sucks or maybe the second person doesn't mean you should give up and then say oh well well
4:51:03
no one does a good job I'm the best I'm the best and I know Freelancers have this mindset I did for a long time as a web designer I was like no I'm people
4:51:09
are hiring me I'm supposed to do everything but you could Outsource like WordPress installations or the basic
4:51:15
setup on web flow and this and that so hopefully this all made sense I'll see you on the next one so what should be
4:51:22
your focus monitoring Outreach channels and metrics on a spreadsheet so my
4:51:27
assistants also put the all the different metrics how many people responded how many people actually booked how many people are qualified
4:51:32
who's not qualified on a spreadsheet and then you as the CEO as the executive
4:51:37
even if you have one part-time employee even if you have no employees start thinking like the CEO of this company
4:51:43
and that will help you monitor this you are the one steering the ship you should be doing intro calls sales calls and
4:51:50
follow-ups now again you can Outsource this later on but I certainly don't recommend this in the beginning this
4:51:55
should be your brand clients should be talking to you and at the end of the day that's one of the highest leverage tasks
4:52:01
that you can have onboarding calls a bit of client management work SL phone calls
4:52:06
so for lower ticket Services you don't need monthly checking calls if someone's paying you $150 per month you should not
4:52:13
be calling them once a month just to check in on them right once they're doing marketing then they're going to
4:52:19
have more expectations or you know they want to know more about the leads and this and that like if they're paying our our our fee is 2,000 a month for
4:52:25
marketing services and so you know for clients that are paying thousands per month they expect some kind of checkin
4:52:32
call and performance update and that kind of thing but not necessarily for
4:52:37
hosting so you don't have to worry about that but but in the beginning clients do need handholding and you'll find that in
4:52:44
the beginning you're teaching these people a new habit you're teaching them to use the lead connector app you're
4:52:50
teaching them to use high level for their business to check high level to check their conversations to respond to
4:52:56
their leads this is all very important and actually one thing that I'll add is
4:53:02
even for the onboarding calls this is something you can also Outsource so I did this inside of upwork as well you
4:53:08
could type in onboarding specialist so in the future maybe you don't have enough clients yet you're not making
4:53:14
enough to hire a full-time person to like do client management work but you just want to outsourced onboarding calls so that way you're just signing clients
4:53:20
and then talking to clients after they already have everything set up you can also hire someone to do an onboarding call because all you're doing there is
4:53:27
just showing them a website so you can hire someone else even if they charge 20 bucks or 50 bucks an hour right one
4:53:33
onboarding call is one hour so if you get three onboarding calls that month then whatever right you paid them 150
4:53:40
bucks but you made way more right you made what is that 450 if you get three
4:53:45
clients so the more they can be the more they can be invested into using your
4:53:51
desktop app for their business and the lead connector app on their mobile phone
4:53:57
the better if they check it every day that's the best if they check it every other day not as good if they check it
4:54:04
once a week definitely not good and if they check it once a month they probably won't be your client for very long they
4:54:09
need to get in the habit of checking this and using it for their business so
4:54:15
how do we actually make more per customer so if you want to make more money you have to learn Facebook ads or
4:54:21
Google ads or SEO and offer it to those clients again upsell them this could be a month in two months in three months in
4:54:28
to them being your client upsell them these ads hey hope you're loving this hope you're loving this website I
4:54:33
actually just stumble across this thing would love to show you when's a good time to jump on zoom and again these are your clients you can just call them
4:54:39
right just call them just shoot them a text hey let's jump on a quick call let me know when you're free offer that to
4:54:44
your existing clients you'll go from $300 a month clients to 1,500 or $2,000 per month clients now if you're learning
4:54:51
these skills as you're getting web design clients you're building a baseline level of clients and then once
4:54:57
you do learn this skill and you want to test it for people and again if you're brand new you don't know how to do this service just do it the first month for
4:55:03
free test it on them but that's not the topic of this video that's the the software with
4:55:10
service model in this video we're talking about software with services in terms of web design so I like ads for
4:55:17
clients and also for your agency clients need ads if it's not you they're going
4:55:24
to pay someone else that's the biggest thing so you can sit here and close your eyes and say I'm just a web designer but
4:55:31
all that money is going to be spent with someone else even if you don't want to do it find a partner and send it to them
4:55:37
and they'll charge you 300 or like a white label agency they'll charge you 3400 you can charge your 1,000 or500 and
4:55:44
still make a lot of profit monthly if you don't want to learn the skills you can use upex so again um
4:55:50
we've talked about this before you can run the ads within your goad level account and also the client can just run
4:55:56
it themselves you can hire a media buyer media buyer is an expert that runs all of your ads um example my media buyer
4:56:04
that I found him inside of a Facebook group he's been with me for many many years now and he was spending like
4:56:10
it was like three it was like three or four or or like $5,000 a day in the Home
4:56:16
Services space on like it was a it was a agency and he was managing over 30
4:56:23
clients he was managing so much money per month and they were paying him was like $350 a month to work full-time not
4:56:30
even full-time he's working like 50 or 60 hours a week and he had so much experience and I hired him and I just
4:56:36
showed him hey we work with remodelers very similar to what you did with solar blah blah blah trained him a little bit
4:56:41
and now and then I trained him in high level as well so he handles everything also I just mentioned this so
4:56:47
you have a white label company has a team in place they can run everything for you now let's talk about ads for your agency this right here is super
4:56:54
super exciting So eventually you can run ads to your company so meetings just appear on your calendar every morning
4:57:00
you wake up and you just have meetings of people that are raising their hands saying yes I wanted a meeting at 2 p.m.
4:57:05
at 3 p.m. tell me about these services that you have and these are automatic booked sales calls and as you can see
4:57:13
here amount spent and I'm going to talk about this in a second but if you spend 4,000 200 you can get a Facebook lead
4:57:22
cost of about $10 so for low ticket you may lose money on month one meaning low ticket means if
4:57:29
you're charging $150 a month or $300 a month you may lose money on the first
4:57:34
month but that's okay because we have recurring Services most softwares by the way don't make money until like months
4:57:40
later when they spend money on Advertising so here's an example I know this doesn't just work for me because I
4:57:45
had someone in my community his name is Kai he spent $4.2 th000 this is an exact
4:57:51
screenshot that he shared with me he shared a screen we jumped on zoom and he made 3.2k in recurring income okay so on
4:58:00
month one he actually lost money spent 42,000 right spent a bunch of time doing these meetings and he signed 3.2k in
4:58:08
monthly recurring income but month two he was all in profit right
4:58:15
6,400 now he's in profit month three he more than doubled his money and he has recurring clients and he told me that no
4:58:20
one canceled not one person canel his services and these are recurring right
4:58:26
so he's building a recurring business and again this isn't just me
4:58:31
this is one of my students I can give you my story when when we were running ads for my agency I was selling High
4:58:38
ticket and if you do sell High tick you can be more profitable every time we would spend
4:58:44
$1,000 I would get 8 to 10 meetings roughly so we're spending about 80 to
4:58:49
100 to 100 something per meeting I would always at least close two of those meetings our fee is 1,500 per month so
4:58:59
if you do the math two clients that's $3,000 per month that's our service fee that's not even counting ad spend or any
4:59:04
other uh anything else that the client had to cover so we spent $ 1,000 we made back $3,000 per month in recurring
4:59:11
Revenue it's hard not to grow a business when you have numbers like that so shown you that's one of my students definitely
4:59:18
works it's worked well for us you could do high ticket you could do low ticket completely up to you and I actually
4:59:24
interviewed him inside my community as well and um he shared all of his ads his um ad his his exact ad account the exact
4:59:32
video that he got those people in to his business from and he just like pulled back the carton he shared exactly what
4:59:37
pay sent him to the survey that they filled out uh it's very similar to mine um and then he shared his his entire
4:59:43
process so anyways case studies and referrals uh you can get video case studies where you interview your clients
4:59:52
this is extremely powerful when your clients jump on video some people in the web design space just put in like a link
4:59:57
to a website or screenshots to like here's our past projects I have found that clients don't really really like
5:00:03
this what they enjoy way more is if you just have a video of you interviewing your
5:00:08
client and and you can do this at any point you can collect any win you possibly can because I realized it's not
5:00:15
even about what they say on the video I mean obviously if they say a lot of amazing things it's better than if they
5:00:20
say something negative but even if they get 10 reviews in the first three days
5:00:25
because of your Google reviews campaign or they get five appointments in three days because of your database
5:00:30
reactivation campaign it's not that impressive but it's still cool they didn't spend any money on ads or even
5:00:36
they just love this new website that you built them basically anytime excited about anything ask them at the end of
5:00:43
that Zoom meeting if you can use that clip on your website that's the real way to do it I have testimonials that I
5:00:49
literally asked my clients to film me so so my clients have got out a phone boom like this they're talking into their
5:00:55
phone and then they send me that video and I post that on my website I also have clients that I specifically ask
5:01:01
them hey do you mind doing a client interview with me and I jumped on Zoom like this and we're just talking and I'm
5:01:06
just interviewing them hey so where were you before we got started where you at now how do you like the new website we built how do you like the the ads that
5:01:11
we built are you actually turning these leads into customers like how's it going for you how much money have you made from our campaigns and I actually
5:01:17
interview them and then other times if I'm doing a client check-in call and I'm just asking them right we talked about
5:01:23
this earlier ask them how the reviews have gone and if they're raving about you at the end of that Zoom just say hey
5:01:28
do you mind if I clip that I just put that on my website and just just share that you got these awesome results I've
5:01:34
never had a client say no so even having this is a huge win record every Zoom call so there you go just ask them about
5:01:42
it and they'll most of the time be more than happy to do that for you most potential clients will never watch these
5:01:49
but it will give you insane social proof when new clients are looking you up that's all they want to see a client might click play on one of them watch 5
5:01:55
seconds and hear your client's voice scroll down scroll up and and that's it but now they trust
5:02:01
you so it's not even about having this super long video I have testimonials that are like 45 seconds long because
5:02:08
it's just the client raving about oh yeah we got five appointments in 3 days blah blah blah it was so cool you know we just got started two days ago and
5:02:14
already our calendar has five appointments that's crazy and it is crazy but it's all very possible and
5:02:19
they're all genuine testimonials and now I'm going to be giving you a bunch of free resources whether you're on High
5:02:26
level whether you're not on High level there's still things that you can take away here so the first thing I have
5:02:31
inside of our resources Google doc and this is going to be linked up below this
5:02:36
video as well is the best agency tool spreadsheet so when you actually click on this spreadsheet right here you're
5:02:42
going to get access to every single tool that we have talked about on this training I have compiled it made it look
5:02:48
amazing and also I know we just talked about like case studies and calls so I do want to emphasize here that once you
5:02:55
join our school community and you sign up to go high level um using my link
5:03:00
Down Below in the resources tab if you go under classroom we actually do have a case studies call script right here so
5:03:07
you can essentially have a script that you're following when you're talking to your potential clients as well as you're going to get access to all these
5:03:13
snapshots and bonuses now again you can import all this to your account and everything will be completely built if
5:03:19

5:04:24
custom website the website in a day all you have to do is just change it right here under this first part the services
5:04:30
right so just change maybe what services you're providing and then you can also even change the compensation and payment
5:04:36
although I added in fields so when you drive and drop that like field this is
5:04:41
where you could change it if you wanted to if you want to add like a term like a contract length and stuff you can do
5:04:47
that there but the rest of this I would just keep the same um I've been using this contract for all of my different
5:04:52
services and it's been working very very well so let's go back into the resources

what's up what's up everybody hey how's it going
0:15
i'm always not sure when the live stream actually starts working so
0:20
good to see you all everybody that showed up here um on this kind of last
0:26
minute notice to hang out with me and design some stuff for our website so i i'm
0:33
going to be straight up up front with you i haven't been actually designing websites and
0:39
stuff for quite a while with creating courses and managing the team and everything that's going on with flux but
0:45
as some of you might know uh in a couple of weeks we're releasing a new course and branding course and so we need to
0:51
create a new page on our website and we have a new copy um
0:56
we're working with a copywriter and she wrote a great copy for this page which challengingly uh is not exactly in the
1:03
kind of like template or structure that we have for our other page so i'm going to have to rethink
1:08
structure layout i'm probably going to have to create some new image assets perhaps 3d assets so it's going to be
1:15
challenging and i only have about let's say an hour and a half about two hours
1:21
to do this so let's see how far we go along um thank you all for
1:28
joining i can see your let me open up the comments here what is up
1:33
from delhi from india from serbia what is up everybody thank you so much
1:41
for joining um i'm going to ask you some when i'm not sure about ideas and stuff like this i'm
1:47
going to ask for your opinion so i'm going to try to make this a little bit
1:53
interactive and hopefully fun for you so with that said let's let's get to
1:59
work we're not here to chit chat today we're actually here to work
2:04
um and let me change these things i'm gonna have to move these things over here hopefully
2:11
you can see my screen right now and uh okay so let me show you what
2:18
we've got to work with all right so first of all this is the copy um
Copywriting for landing page
2:24
you you hopefully you all know the flux academy website and then we have courses let me show you how courses pages look
2:31
like right now this is a basic template that we have we have kind of an intro a logo we have our video and then some
2:38
kind of like the benefits some more information about me the curriculum of the course um you know
2:45
about our community it's and that's it basically testimony is it's pretty straightforward now in this new page i'm going to show
2:52
you this is the copy we've got a lot more copy to start working with here
2:59
a lot more materials so i'm still not sure how to structure this we also have three instructors on the new course so
3:06
we have rachel matt and me so new sections to create
3:11
um yeah there's gonna be some challenging things here so let's see how we're gonna start doing it so i'm
3:18
working with figma and this is basically the figma file that we have
3:23
for the flux website it's pretty elaborate at this point
Working with Figma
3:28
but we have most of our pages designed here and because we already
3:34
have some styles and you can see on the right here i've got some textiles i've got the colors so i have a lot of
3:40
materials to work with and a lot of components i can probably reuse i also
3:46
have this file which we call content and just have a bunch of assets that we have created
3:52
you know over time and maybe i'll choose to use some of them but maybe i'll need to create
3:59
new assets so i have here adobe dimension ready for creating some
4:04
3d assets if i'll need to let's see how things are going i also have this streamline icons which is a
4:13
package of icons that um we have an account for we purchased this once and a lot of the
4:19
icons that you sometimes see i think yeah when you see these small icons that
4:25
we have here they're coming from the streamline icon so if i need some icons i can just grab them from here so that's
4:32
going to be useful and okay so let's see
4:38
what i'm going to use so i've created a new page here branding landing page this is what i'll need to create
Designing a landing page
4:44
and i'm going to take i'm going to take i have one called long
4:50
sales page which is we tested this once for webflow like a very long
4:55
sales page as you can see so i'm going to start with this just because i think there's a lot of components here that i
5:01
might want to reuse so let me start by copying and pasting this into the new page
5:08
i'm going to put it here and then what else maybe i'm going to bring the
5:13
web design becoming a professional we have maybe only this one because here we have
5:20
some new types of sections so maybe i'm just going to take this thing
5:25
and i'm going to bring it here can you see and and everything looks
5:30
okay all right cool okay so now that i've got these things
5:37
to help me work with i'm actually going to so let me show you i'm going to
5:42
duplicate this and actually i'm going to delete probably everything that's on it
5:50
okay i'm also let me rename this branding landing page
5:59
for the sake of the people that are going to work here after me and let's start off by just
6:05
these is probably going to stay the same right so this is just going to be called brand
6:12
design mastery uh we need to replace the logo so i i
6:18
have created already we have created a new logo for the brand design mastery
6:24
and it's i'm gonna copy it but there was something that i wanted to do here before so i got feedback from
6:31
our other designers in the team that maybe these
6:38
these rectangulars are too small and they're just like you know they look annoying when you see
6:44
the logo in small shape there's no real reason to do that so maybe i'm going to just delete these
6:51
rectangulars because it doesn't work really well in small scale
6:58
and let me take this logo not sure copying and pasting how
7:05
friendly illustrator because this was designed in illustrator and figma are so
7:11
let's see what happens when i paste this yeah it actually works
7:17
so i'm going to do this same size i'm also going to
7:23
already set this up as svg for expert because joanna is going to go after me
7:29
and redo and you know take these assets to webflow so that it's ready for her
7:34
for export one thing that's weird though that i can see here is i think the colors are not matching
7:40
so this color and this color yeah you can see they're not the same color so
7:46
i'm just gonna let's pick up all of these and choose the color here
7:52
um let's choose i don't know if these are the master
7:58
color but let's use so that all the colors are
8:06
synced actually yeah i can just pick it from
8:12
here so that it's global it's probably what i should have done here as well
8:18
so by using global colors later if we change you know the swatches everything is going to be updated automatically
8:25
put this here okay so let's bring the title
8:34
so if this is brand design mastery it looks like this is the title right land your next big client with full branding
8:40
plus web design solution i don't know about the plus inside of
8:45
heading so maybe maybe we're going to change this to an
8:51
ampersand let's see how this looks lens your length big client with full
8:56
branding and web design
9:02
solution it's a it's a long title i would try to
9:08
make this a little shorter also i'm not a huge fan of the word solution
9:14
land your next big client with a full branding and web design
9:19
project hmm all right
9:25
for now land your next big client with a full branding and web design
9:32
solution all right i'm going to keep it for now
9:38
start learning going to keep it the same here we're going to have a new video but actually
9:46
i think we might need to change this because for most of our courses we have you know
9:51
a lot of people who signed up yet this is a new course so we don't have like an impressive number on it yet the second
9:57
thing is that we have three instructors
10:02
um for this course so i wonder if we should present this
10:09
differently um
10:18
interesting uh because it's complex to put like three names here and
10:24
three images here also we'll have sections on them below
10:29
hmm i am not sure
10:36
what to do with this to begin with already i'm stuck i'm not even in the first section and i'm stuck
10:43
um what should we do because down the line we probably do want to add this so i
10:50
wouldn't want to completely want to get rid of it um
11:03
so what should we do should we put three images here should we do with with with three times it's too much information
11:10
here um so what i'll do for now
11:15
is i'll remove the width and i will put uh this here in the center because it
11:21
doesn't make sense to just i guess left aligned it if there's nothing on the other hand
11:31
and so i think right now we have a better group of about i think
11:37
180 students or something like this 170 students so i'm going to put this here
11:46
should we put it at this point or should we not put it at this point maybe we won't put this at this point
11:51
and then we'll edit down the line 170 is not that impressive so i guess
11:57
we'll start with this because this is the launch of this okay so
12:02
one thing that's going to make it easier for me to design the next section is i'm going to turn the grid on so
12:09
we can see the grid and then we can place content on the grid so what is the first section so the first section is as
12:16
a web designer you know that adding branding even though it sounds like you haven't
12:21
figured out how to make it work for you okay so what we have here in the first
12:27
section is bullet points that are supposed to help the
12:33
you know the person understand if this is their situation so to see if you
12:39
can relate to this so this is a section with bullet points uh and we do have sections with bullet
12:47
points and we can use this kind of like centered section and we do have bullet
12:53
points like this so we can use this type of uh
13:01
this type of section but i wonder if we should
13:06
create an image or do something a little bit more engaging off the top um but let's see let's put
13:14
this here and let's center it
13:20
uh i guess it needs to be centered on the grid exactly
13:25
and let's see what that would up
13:30
what that would look like when we put the actual content inside so as a web designer
13:48
the thing is i don't like to put a lot of text with this big bold text
13:54
um but then again you know what other textiles do we have
13:59
if this is not we do have either display
14:07
as a web designer you know that's adding man that's not big enough for a title but
14:12
then h3 and then that was h2
14:22
this is why sometimes i think that the like the typographic tools that we have
14:27
on our website the style guide that we have on our website right now is not very ideal for long text
14:34
so we should either keep it the shorter text or we should change you know our typography
14:40
um this is a little bit at least more
14:47
readable but i wonder why this looks more readable as if the
14:53
line height here is 98 and over there it looks
14:59
like it's maybe we need to edit the
15:05
the actual yeah you see here we need to change this to
15:10
98 or something no 98
15:16
okay so at least it's a little bit more readable right now
15:26
also you see if i push a little bit beyond the grid
15:32
the composition of this box looks a little better versus this because
15:38
now we have this last word orphan here that doesn't look very well
15:44
um well we'll have to see how this actually
15:50
looks on the website let's bring in the text box here
16:00
and bring in this paragraph
16:05
constantly trying to switch between windows and
16:19
and i should just switch between tabs okay
16:26
so we have this we have this where you know i can copy the text here
16:33
but basically it's let's see how it looks
16:39
uh i'm i'll stop him can't stop doing it
16:47
okay this is sales fizzle out it's a bummer that
16:54
figma does not copy the bold
17:00
[Music] and i don't even have
17:05
i need to unlink so that i can bold the text
17:13
fizzle out or sales conversation fills it out
17:20
okay i'm not going to do the whole typography here just because it's going to be very boring and
17:26
you know joanna can do it later on when she's just moving it to webflow i just want to see how it looks
17:34
uh and whether we do need an image here or we can just go with this
17:40
adding branding to your services meaning creating more value and charging more
17:46
okay so we got this and then we have you don't want to just mill through the
17:51
client project like an amateur you want to follow a complete try and test road map knowing you're not missing and
17:57
skipping steps you want to work with bigger clients okay so what i think is
18:04
we can add some kind of an image here
18:11
we did have two paragraph for three paragraph three paragraphs
18:19
i think we can use this area here to create some kind of a visual that
18:26
we also have this kind of a like a background purple background maybe we'll do
18:32
put that here um just to add kind of like a new section
18:44
and in it later on we're going to put some kind of a visual
18:49
so i'm temporarily putting like a rectangular here like put something here and we're going to think about this
18:57
um in a few minutes maybe we have already something that can be
19:02
perceived as a process because we're mentioning here right process
19:10
you want a complete tried and tested road map showing you you're not missing or skipping any steps
19:17
so maybe we can do kind of like you know you have the steps the strategy and the
19:24
idea and then the presentation and then the design so maybe we can do kind of
19:29
like a little road map so let me leave a note for myself let's
19:36
say this is a road map or some some kind um and we'll do
19:42
road map road map image
19:49
we'll do that a little bit later all right let's see what this next
19:54
section is this could be used six months from now and then there are some
20:00
kind of like quotes of how people would feel after they've taken the course
20:07
basically it looks the same thing like it's saying we can use the same structure in terms
20:14
of headline and bullet points so let me just take this
20:22
here oh
20:30
let me just copy that all right so
20:35
this could be you
20:43
and then we're putting a bunch of bullet points
20:51
actually this can go down here and this can
21:05
okay
21:18
can i put music on youtube live streams uh i don't know is it like are they going to
21:24
copyright this thing so that nobody can listen to anything or what's what's like the static because i feel like it can be
21:30
much funner much fun more fun i guess if we have a little bit of music
21:37
does anybody here knows what's the like legal status of putting music on live streams
21:43
if you do know let me know in the comments okay so we've got this
21:50
section this can be you and then that's why we created
21:56
brand design mastery so now i feel like
22:01
we need to bring in the big guns which means the h ones
22:07
so brand design mastery so we need to create a big probably
22:15
let's turn this into h1 let's do maybe centered and
22:23
bam okay so this is the introduction of the course itself
22:30
so i think whether we need to put in because when we had it for the webflow one
22:36
i think when we introduced it yeah right so this was something similar it's time you meet the webflow master
22:43
class and then we had this image like you see the video course and you see other things that are included
22:50
um yeah i think we should do something similar some kind of a mock-up
22:57
um of what the course looks like or what the course includes
23:04
and i wonder what maybe we should do what we did there where the there
23:10
before this it's time that you meet maybe that's what we need to do here as
23:16
well instead of the that's why we created
23:22
yeah maybe we can take this put this here no but i want this to be so this is h3
23:30
let's turn this into h3 and we remove this from here
23:39
okay so as i said let's leave ourselves
23:44
an image here that says create course we'll do that later
23:52
so this is going to be course mock-up mock-up here okay
24:00
i just rather you know go on the flow of finishing out the content and layout first and then dealing with the imagery
24:06
later so let's see what's after that everything you need to sell and deliver
24:12
full professional brand design as a service so let's put this
24:18
below the image although it probably can also be
24:23
i don't know if h3 or h2 let's see
24:30
let's see how that look likes in h2 maybe let's bring the color back to purple
24:38
everything you need so what do you say we should do it like a big thing
24:45
like an h2 we can have it
24:51
all the way like everything you need or we can make it
24:56
more centered of like the content that we have here
25:01
which is only six columns wide um so six columns wide yeah it's this so
25:09
this maybe let's try h3 no you know what i feel like it's better
25:14
when it's h2 but all around all across the grid so that seems good for now
25:22
of course and by the way this really matters what looks good in figma might not look
25:28
good when it's developed
25:38
do you see okay by the way i see an error here you need to change video resolution
25:46
does everything look okay on the screen just let me know like yes yes yes
25:51
okay no music please all right so i'm not going to put some music
26:00
all right okay so let's get back to it so what do
26:06
we have here brand design mastery is an online course designed to help you out
26:15
so these i feel like these paragraphs
26:22
need to be maybe next to the image versus below the
26:28
image what do we have here no actually we have here also paragraphs
26:36
um okay so let's do that as well let's take a paragraph here let's also bring in
26:41
the enroll button because i saw there was like an enroll button there
26:47
let's try and see how that looks like
26:58
no sorry
27:04
so of course there would be some kind of bold here go from robust strategy to unique
27:11
so visual identity
27:16
to break this so that we can make it bold
27:21
but now we have something which is a little bit weird because we have this title at the top
27:29
which is going across you know the 12 columns and then below
27:34
it we have um just
27:42
six columns so it's weird like it's wide and then maybe we do something different
27:47
maybe we left the line this on six columns and then we put this here
27:57
and we do two columns i don't know that we have this layout before on our website and we have this here
28:06
maybe something like this
28:15
actually i need
28:20
uh i don't know how it's fixed height fixed like
28:28
okay i never know how these things work okay
28:33
i actually think this looks better in two columns what do you think
28:41
i think this the only problem with this is that if this is going to end up looking
28:46
something like this like not a full width it might be weird
28:52
but i can also try and make something wide and then it's going to look good
29:02
might it may be weird because we are centered centered on six columns centered centered boom all of a sudden
29:09
two columns it's kind of like changing out the layout but maybe it's good to break things up a
29:14
little bit right otherwise it may be boring um
29:21
yeah also maybe i need to bring in like purple section every once in a while
29:26
to break things up a little bit all right let's see what else we have yeah you see we need a line to
29:33
understand hey now we're moving into a different section so by the end of this program you'll be able to
29:38
and then we have one two three four
29:44
four kind of like bullet points uh and these have titles so we can put like an icon or something here let me
29:51
see if this fits we can use these these uh
29:57
components although they don't have titles here but i think they might be a good fit
30:03
although we need four of them so let's see how this goes but i want to do
30:09
i want to somehow do make it feel like this is an end of a
30:14
section so i don't know if we should
30:24
actually you know what maybe here's an idea maybe this thing
30:30
needs to be like we're going to have like a purple purple section here all of a sudden
30:37
to break things up to introduce the brand design mastery
30:43
this is going to be purple section
30:49
and this let's say it's going to be something like this and these can be white
30:55
and this can be white as well
31:02
and then we have like a and this can be
31:09
or let's take this to the top um
31:15
this can be where is this we can make this
31:23
light and the text can be purple
31:33
what do you say about this
31:42
all right i see you're asking to disable the the grid let's disable the grid so
31:48
that we can see how it looks all right so we're scrolling we're scrolling we've got an image and then boom we have we're
31:56
moving into a purple section i actually like this idea i think it's like
32:01
you know boom now you're introdu introducing the product so this kind of like highlights and focus
32:08
things over this let's keep going this one i like this
32:14
all right i'm going to bring back the grid just so that it's easier
32:19
all right so now we have the next section which is by the end of this program you'll be able to
32:26
let's copy that and let's take this for example
32:32
can paste it here i feel like this needs to be an h2 probably
32:40
and let's keep it to the six columns that we previously had
32:47
but that annoys me right you see the two it's an orphan like just one word and
32:53
that annoys me ah i see just a little bit and we can wrap it in two
32:58
uh lines now usually i think they were purple but just because we have this purple section
33:05
i think maybe it's good to go with black
33:11
okay so now we want to have four of these things right one two three four
33:18
so the good thing about you know the good thing about
33:23
12 12 column grid is that it's divisible by so many things so we can do one
33:31
two three four now let's see what happens
33:37
when i squish them squished them so the icons don't look good but
33:43
in any case i'm going to replace the the icons here but let's see how this looks if the if the
33:50
headings are going to fit in here
33:55
or if it's even going to make sense so if i turn this into display offer
34:02
full stack solution i think these something is wrong here with the line height this cannot be
34:08
really the line height needs to be i don't know 25 at least
34:14
maybe a hundred yeah offer a full stack solution
34:23
but maybe needs to be bold content low offer full stack solution
34:39
what happen if i just take the medium and then i make it bold
34:46
the problem with this is that it's not really scannable it's going to be difficult to scan
34:52
through this offer a full stacks this is scannable
34:59
but then this is not ideal let's see how much body text we have
35:10
yeah okay so you see because we have a lot of text here i guess four columns is not going
35:15
to be ideal so what i would do is
35:21
i'm going to leave one just so that i have reference to the icon but let's do it
35:27
six columns and then i'll have two of these
35:35
okay and then i can do something like this offer a full stack solution
35:45
i think this looks better we'll bring in an icon in a second
35:52
work faster let's see how this looks work faster
36:07
now you got to note that because this is two lines and this is one line the space
36:12
here is bigger than the space there but it's better i think than just having the same space and then
36:18
this looks weird right so i'm gonna keep it also maybe we have more text here so
36:25
we're gonna have to use or joanna is gonna have to use flexbox to manage the
36:30
spacing when this gets to webflow but yeah i definitely think this
36:38
is much easier to scan and this is a good solution so first
36:44
do we even by the way need to bring in icons what do you think would it be cool with icons
36:50
i think it will be cool with icons
36:58
okay so let's think about icons for this thing well let's bring in the last few of them
37:05
device clients on strategy and then so with confidence
37:23
hmm
37:37
okay gonna take a minute to look at the
37:42
comments good to see you all in the comments what do what's up what's up
37:55
[Music] are you guys having good time here 280 people nice and this was just a last
38:02
minute thing i'm excited thank you for showing up this is really fun doing it with you okay
38:08
so let's check out let's put in some icons here so
38:15
offer a full stack solution what would be a good icon for a full stack solution
38:20
first of all which one is i think that's what we're using streamline lite
38:28
full stack i guess it can be a briefcase like briefcase full of things what is full
38:35
stack uh how does full stack icon let's if i do fool
38:42
what does this show me for fool a lot of people no maybe a box full of things
38:51
maybe briefcase brief case brief brief
38:58
briefcase briefcase
39:06
briefcase briefcase with a lot of things this can be nice for full stack
39:15
let's see what happens if i write full stack
39:23
i actually like this when you see a stack of things one on top of another
39:29
it's actually not a bad idea what else do we have here
39:38
we have this thing which shows a lot of things one on top of another
39:44
you know what this is my favorite icon right now so let's try and use this i can download it
39:50
as an svg to begin with you know what i can already bring it in the right color so why don't we do that
39:58
to begin with right let's take the color here
40:04
let's put the color here bam and then just oh i can actually copy
40:09
it amazing i don't even have to download it bam copy and paste
40:15
amazing the world that we are living in but as i'm scaling this through
40:22
the lines get uh the lines get thinner so the vectors i'm
40:27
gonna have to put this i think 1.5 is what we used
40:33
here right 1.5 yeah so 1.5
40:42
and let's see right now this looks
40:47
okay to me size of the icon let's
40:53
see what other things we have work faster uh i can imagine that i already have an
41:01
icon for fast like a like something moving really fast so
41:08
there's this scooter but maybe clock how do you say this stop watch stop watch
41:16
it's a lot of time this is an icon for working faster because this is what you know sportsmen
41:23
sports people use one thing that is annoying is hey i just
41:30
changed this to purple they could have remembered that right let's copy that
41:35
paste it in here paste it in here
41:41
scale it to something like 46 go through inside and choose to put
41:47
these at a stroke of 1.5 and let's put it here
41:53
by the way remember i said i need to prep this up for joanna so i'll set them up as svg already
42:02
that will be kind of me
42:07
let's why are these this should be grouped
42:14
let's call this faster icon this is also important right when she's
42:20
gonna export it uh that's the name of the file so it's it gotta make sense or it's helpful when
42:26
it makes sense so let's call this full stack icon
42:33
then we have advise clients on strategy all right so strategy usually you use
42:40
things like either uh you know an arrow
42:46
in a target or sometimes you have these strategy
42:52
like soccer strategy strategy yeah so this is the main cliche
42:59
of strategy i actually think we already used this icon somewhere on the website
43:05
um but let's use let's use this one
43:12
all right
43:21
all right copy that
43:27
all right paste it here let's call this strategy strategy icon
43:37
now in an ideal world you know i would know what icons we already have
43:44
on our website i would maybe have like an organized design system file with all
43:49
the icons and whatnot but we're not there yet
43:55
one day we'll be corporate or something but
44:00
we're not there yet hey wait why did you leave your your group friends
44:07
so this is strategy icon
44:13
it's it's not very helpful that they put the help exactly where i need to push the export right it's a little bit
44:20
annoying okay sell with confidence
44:26
so what's sell money handshake sales
44:32
for sale sales sales sale to do no that's not what i want
44:37
uh sale
44:43
deal let's search for a deal two to two
44:50
we see two people talk about money handshake handshake
44:59
let's go with handshake i think that's an easy one for closing deals
45:18
all right
45:32
all right so let's call this sales
45:38
cell cell icon
45:44
it's weird why do we need this to be so big
45:49
we don't need this to be so big
45:59
okay so we're done with this section
46:05
oh we have some leftover thing here but we can put this on top we can group
46:13
these together okay nice okay so this section is done next
46:20
section meet your instructors
46:26
so let's see what we have previously
46:33
we had either this section introducing me there was also on other
46:40
pages this section looks a little bit different
46:48
it looks like this on other
46:59
i think let's just create it from scratch right some something like this but
47:05
let's create it from scratch but the thing is um
47:11
the thing is we want to move into a new section again
47:18
and do we need a divider or something else or we can just take this like
47:27
and just do meet your instructors and that's enough
47:36
and by the way she wrote here meet your instructors period which is weird shouldn't be like
47:43
commas or or something like this because it's introducing them
47:48
this is a little bit too big but this can be nice and then we can choose the purple one
47:57
actually you know what maybe it is good to make it big
48:02
and that's that's how it's going to be clear that this is a new section
48:07
is it too big i don't know meet your instructors last time that we
48:12
had this was brand design mastery meet your instructor this is very big
48:19
but this is too small or
48:32
i don't know i feel like we need something to split between these two sections
48:40
here you see when i cut off every time i cut off it was with a big h1 and here as
48:46
well so i think yeah it's going to be an h1 that's that's a way to separate them to
48:52
make it clear that this is a new section okay so meet your instructors and then
48:58
we're going to have let's say an image here
49:03
half of the thing six columns an image and then
49:08
let's take here some
49:14
text in
49:19
let's see how this looks so first of all we have rachel i wonder if we should
49:25
start with me not because i like to talk about myself first but
49:30
just because most people are more familiar with me than they are with rachel and matt
49:36
um i don't know all right i'm gonna start with with me
49:43
and then and then go with them i think it's better to start with
49:48
something that's a bit more familiar first okay
49:55
so let's break this down into a few paragraphs okay so this is it
50:03
now let's first do the composition and then we'll bring in the images
50:10
and i'm not sure whether we whether it be cooler to do it bottom align versus top align somehow
50:17
it feels better that way so basically now i'm going to just flip
50:23
it let's see if i can just no i can just flip these around
50:32
no god damn it i wish i knew how to use figma i should probably not say this on the
50:39
on these live streams right if i ever want to create
50:44
a figma workshop hint hint soon in the future um
50:49
okay but i will pick up my my figma game don't
50:55
worry about it okay rachel
51:01
this course is so good by the way it was such a pleasure to create this course with other
51:07
experts like rachel and matt it was just so fun and the content is just so good
51:12
i'm very excited to share this with you um so this is rachel and then we have
51:19
matt um we'll bring it up here
51:26
actually why is this not all the way here
51:33
i wonder if i wonder if this should go all the way
51:40
it should probably go all the way
51:48
yeah matt brunton
51:54
how do you like matt's videos on youtube i think he's doing really good he's kicking ass he's funny educational
52:03
check out his videos if you haven't seen them yet on the channel
52:11
all right let's see if we've got images to tell
52:18
you the truth the truth is math has the best image
52:23
so let's hear team pictures yeah matt's got a killer picture
52:29
can i just drop it into this will it work if i just drop it into this
52:35
no why oh why do i need to do mask
52:43
where's the mask thing
52:48
i need to i definitely need to retake my photo
52:56
to make it similar to matt that looks super pro this image i love it
53:05
wait i want to remove the grid so we can actually see what's going on here
53:13
okay so matt's got a killer picture rachel got a good picture but the thing
53:20
is it's not aligned with you know if we want to have similar
53:25
art direction so this is a great photo but i think matt got it right with like a
53:32
clear background and the purple lightning so that that's kind of like how we have it in the course as well
53:38
and i think yeah we need to open we need to do the
53:43
same here so i guess me and rachel are gonna have to take take new pictures
53:52
um it is a great picture though
53:59
but completely different kind of like color scheme and
54:06
but well at least we have something to work with now for me
54:13
my photo is let's go with this one but let's go with
54:19
without the background and then i'll try to create a background fake background like mats
54:26
and see how that goes we'll see if that works for me
54:32
so it's kind of like a similar size but i'm just going to retake this photo
54:45
but for the mask can i add a fill
54:57
no so i guess i'm going to add
55:03
this here where is
55:08
where's mine all right and so we want to make this a gradient
55:18
radial gradient with like black and purple maybe
55:26
the other way around though
55:32
something like this
55:39
somewhat similar to matt although it's fake
55:44
all right so we've got that wait wait
55:52
why is it locked why can't i change it
55:59
i don't know something here is locked okay
56:05
accidentally locked the same okay so meet your instructors and then we have me
56:11
rachel matt i actually feel like we need to space them out a little bit
56:18
so let's group them and then space them out
56:30
yeah all right so that looks good meet your instructors
56:37
so that section is done all right let's take a break
56:51
yeah i'm not gonna cut rachel's photo because again she has her her own setup right
56:59
now which is very similar we all have the same black background purple light setup that we have for recording the
57:05
course so it's going to be easy for her to take a new photo okay so the next thing is here's what
57:11
you'll learn and basically this is the curriculum so we have this here
57:19
in this format actually here i don't seem to have it oh
57:24
we i do have it here yeah here's everything that you will
57:29
learn and you have all the modules i'm not going to
57:37
copy and text all the all the text right now because we can do this later on but and
57:44
this is this is boring for me right now so uh let me bring back the grid
57:51
paste this here whoa no
57:57
put this here we do need though to have a different
58:03
section that says here's what you'll learn
58:12
so because i guess i'm not going to use the comas here and
58:17
because otherwise i'm going to need them here as well so here's what you'll learn this will be the full curriculum of all
58:22
the videos we have this on all of our courses so this just makes sense
58:28
um what else when you join you get
58:36
instructional videos course project 12 months of coaching templates additional resource certification
58:42
okay so this this is really important
58:48
i wonder how we should design this because
58:53
one thing we can do is because there are one two three four five six
58:59
seven we can create these you know one two three kind of like similar to what we did here like
59:07
features kind of like but look what we had in our web design course we broke
59:12
them down into kind of like impressive things with like images so that we can really give a focus
59:19
on these things
59:27
so i think actually yeah i think
59:32
this is this is this is a better a better way to sell it uh it puts more
59:39
emphasis on the things uh including the certification and the community and all of that
59:45
so actually i think let me just duplicate this kind of like
59:56
duplicate everything that's going on here i don't want to take the numbers because just like going one two three four until seven
1:00:04
i don't see the point of that but i'm just going to come here and
1:00:09
paste this and
1:00:15
let's turn this into when you join you get
1:00:22
maybe this will turn this into an h2
1:00:27
although this is a new section it does make sense to keep it at h1
1:00:35
i wonder if it's a problem that it's all just like white sections with title but maybe it's fine maybe it's fine
1:00:44
okay so when you join you get and then
1:00:53
so number one is instructional videos by three expert
1:00:58
instructors so here we have both text heading
1:01:05
here an icon as well i don't really know that we need both
1:01:11
icon and the you know 3d thing on the on the right so
1:01:21
um [Music] should we make it five
1:01:27
let's see
1:01:32
yeah it's more attack so let's do it like four or five columns i'm going to remove the icons from here
1:01:40
and we're just going to have to recreate these um
1:01:45
so you know what i'm just going to put here like create image
1:01:56
it's a placeholder that i need to create oh my god i see that we're one hour in
1:02:02
let's see how further along how many more sections do we have after this invest in your future okay so this is
1:02:08
the payment and then faq okay so actually not a lot more
1:02:14
not a lot more this is the last section then there is the end thing so
1:02:20
in a few minutes we're jumping into creating the visuals all right i hope you're excited about
1:02:27
that alright so this is number one number two is
1:02:36
what is number two number two is course projects
1:02:43
okay so course projects and then we have this
1:02:54
okay and then we'll create an image for that now that i see how many we have i'm like
1:03:02
maybe creating seven different images right now is a lot but
1:03:10
we'll see what we can do okay so 12 months of coaching and support actually we have a full-on
1:03:16
section on that that we already have on our website so i
1:03:23
don't see a reason on putting it here [Music]
1:03:29
you know we have let's see where it is
1:03:34
yeah we have this section about the community and support so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna put that
1:03:42
so i'm removing this templates templates and additional resources
1:03:49
let's see what we had previously not here
1:03:58
so checklist resources and tool recommendations i think i'm gonna
1:04:04
batch this and uh
1:04:10
i'm gonna put this these two things together the templates and additional resources together
1:04:18
um i wonder if i have the psd for this so that i can edit this visual
1:04:28
oh i have this here so yeah all right okay so let's see um
1:04:39
okay i'm getting tired it's actually hard to
1:04:44
design and talk at the same time you know so let's do templates and resources
1:04:53
let's bunch them together temp plates and resources
1:05:00
and let's see get personalized uh to help you work more we share time templates proposal strategies
1:05:11
okay so let's combine the text together do some text editing to help you work more efficiently we're sharing all our
1:05:17
tried and tested templates for proposal strategy session and creative presentation
1:05:24
along with our recommendation for
1:05:31
i'll put this along with recommendations
1:05:38
for further reading and
1:05:45
resources i guess further reading and resources okay
1:05:52
so this is this and then what do we have certification we actually
1:05:59
also have a section for that which we have here
1:06:05
um [Music] so let's let's keep it let's use the same section
1:06:10
that we have right now community that's also a section that we have right now so actually that's it
1:06:16
so
1:06:22
putting it in practice actually you know what i'm looking at what she wrote here
1:06:28
course projects did i miss course projects
1:06:35
or i have it yeah of course
1:06:42
yeah so essentially it's the same essentially it's very similar to what we have here
1:06:48
right so this is content and then checklist and resources and put it into practice
1:06:54
so i think i might be able to use these icons to create these visuals i'm only
1:07:00
going to have to change the images of what we have in the background um
1:07:10
yep okay so that's good that's going to make my life easier so we have these three things when you
1:07:16
join you get and after that i am going to put all of the
1:07:21
sections that we have for community uh
1:07:29
i'm going to take these the sections that we have for community and stuff and i'm going to put them here
1:07:36
as well and actually finish course projects i
1:07:42
might use that here this i'm going to remove
1:07:49
this this looks different right now by the way i think it was changed currently on
1:07:57
the website um but let's see what the
1:08:07
community section looks like right now oh here it is so this is the section that we have
1:08:12
right now
1:08:17
so we're just going to take the section for community i'm going to put it here at the bottom
1:08:24
bam
1:08:29
okay so we've got that now we have the payment thing which we
1:08:35
already have designed so we can take it here
1:08:42
i'm not going to change text and prices here
1:08:48
something here didn't work correctly all right
1:08:54
then faq we probably have faqs
1:08:59
let's bring the faqs in there
1:09:14
and what else we have so this is this faqs
1:09:21
and then it's time to step up your rand design game so this is the final section here it's
1:09:27
kind of like call to action so
1:09:35
let's yeah let's just do it i think we're going to use
1:09:43
you know this title and thing and just figure out an image there
1:09:53
actually maybe this is too long to be an h1
1:09:59
it's no looks okay
1:10:14
let's get started and so we need to bring in the enroll
1:10:21
button or maybe just bring the enroll section again
1:10:27
maybe we'll just no let's have the enroll button
1:10:40
okay so we have finished the
1:10:46
tedious part not tedious but the main layout of this page
1:10:52
i can wrap up this page and now
1:10:59
let's get to some image making
1:11:05
but first let me take a break wait okay so what do we whoa whoa something
1:11:12
here moved i made a mistake i know what happened every time
1:11:19
i change the size of the page in figma because some things are kind of like aligned to the bottom
1:11:25
it move things around i hate it never mind okay
1:11:31
so let's take a break of a second let me read the comments for a little
1:11:37
bit and then we dive into some image making
1:12:05
i need to push control all right hold command to resize the frame got it
1:12:13
thank you for thank you for helping me up my figma my figma game
1:12:19
all right okay so let's dive into it um we have
1:12:25
here the main thing we've decided that we what we want to show here
1:12:30
is kind of like a road map right like a road map of
1:12:36
the branding process or understanding where you're going or something like this
1:12:43
um so what it is it's probably a road map that includes you know the strategy the visual side of things
1:12:50
typography color these these kind of things and maybe
1:12:56
maybe we have already some of these elements that we can use
1:13:01
uh this let's see what we have here
1:13:09
we've got this for color we've got this for maybe ideation
1:13:17
or in this maybe for
1:13:22
maybe for strategy what do we have here
1:13:29
here we have all sorts of different elements
1:13:46
all right so
1:13:52
you want to complete tried and true road map
1:13:57
actually maybe we need to maybe it's going to be easier to [Music] do this
1:14:03
road map as a diagram instead of like a 3d element maybe we can do it with icons do you
1:14:10
think it's there's something about the 3ds that is a little bit more impressive
1:14:16
but let's try to sketch it out
1:14:22
let's say that we have um
1:14:28
and also we need to remember this needs to be responsive so whatever i do now for desktop
1:14:34
should make sense and look visible on mobile because right now
1:14:40
so let's say this is going to be let's say strategy and then
1:14:46
ideation and then creativity or
1:14:55
um maybe like a project strategy let me
1:15:01
write down the idea here so this is going to be project maybe like briefcase
1:15:07
briefcase uh and this is going to be
1:15:13
strategy so let's say target this is going to be
1:15:20
um let's say idea so lamp
1:15:25
lamp um and then this is going to be
1:15:32
um let's say um color palette so color
1:15:40
palette some of these elements we have here
1:15:45
but i somehow thinks that they need to be looking the same
1:15:52
so we'll see in a minute how we'll do it so this is a color palette
1:15:58
and then there is a
1:16:05
presentation so maybe this is how do we show a presentation maybe that
1:16:10
like the uh how people used to present back in the day like a stand uh
1:16:17
how do you call these stands like a painting rack painting rack or something like this
1:16:25
and then or maybe
1:16:33
like what is what can be a good symbol for a successful successful presentation
1:16:38
thumbs up or an award maybe i don't know we'll see maybe here needs to be like
1:16:45
thumbs up
1:16:53
maybe this can be a cursor cursor or pen tool pen tool
1:17:01
and so we can do something like a line that to show a process
1:17:10
you know we can do like a line that goes from here
1:17:16
to here to here to here here
1:17:23
and
1:17:31
maybe actually you know what's going to be simpler if we do a rectangular
1:17:40
from here we round the corners this way
1:17:48
and actually should probably be this way
1:17:55
and then no fill but stroke let's do it in a purple color
1:18:01
let's make it five or something like this
1:18:08
and then no
1:18:22
no i want to now just delete the other
1:18:28
parts of this path so
1:18:35
yeah let's just add it here and add it here
1:18:41
and then we can delete and delete no you know what
1:18:47
it's not what i want to do there's a better way to do it which is probably something like
1:18:55
don't round these corners and just
1:19:00
no exactly this is what i wanted i wanted
1:19:08
this to be open okay so this way no but it also i made a mistake
1:19:18
i wanted to make this not rounded but not the other one
1:19:31
how do maybe you know how do i make i don't want all corners to be rounded
1:19:37
exactly this i don't want this i don't want no
1:19:43
this i don't want nope this i don't want okay thank you
1:19:51
thank you finally that was difficult just to draw this shape
1:19:58
maybe i need to bring these friends here
1:20:04
so that we can bring this in here and
1:20:11
okay
1:20:17
so let's take these things and turn them into circles
1:20:24
um so that it looks like a path and these are kind of like the the steps on the
1:20:31
path and it's clear that it's the path
1:20:36
and so we do this now we do this
1:20:47
also let's remove the grid so that we can see what we're doing
1:20:53
how many more images we have of course mock-up all right
1:20:59
we've got work i don't think i will finish this in 30 minutes
1:21:06
i was optimistic i'm gonna design the whole thing in 30 minutes in like two hours
1:21:13
but life is always more complicated than what you think
1:21:20
okay so we've got this path
1:21:25
and now we want to bring in these elements onto the pass let's see what happens if
1:21:32
we bring in the elements that we already have let's see if it even looks good
1:21:38
we have this now they're not gonna they're not gonna
1:21:44
look good if they're different renders from different things
1:21:51
um if i bring this here color palette
1:22:09
let's put this here and then pen tool we have a pen tool
1:22:16
we have but not not not the right one
1:22:22
do we have one here okay
1:22:28
okay so it looks like we're going to need to do some renders
1:22:36
so let's see how we're going to do this um
1:22:41
just so that remember this needs to be color palette all right
1:22:50
so we've got this we've got this adobe dimension
1:22:57
i haven't played with this in a while so let's try to do something
1:23:07
let's see we have got a bunch of objects here but i can probably
1:23:14
there's adobe stock let's see what happens if i do because i
1:23:20
can import here right i can import 3d model okay let's see if i do
1:23:27
free 3d models briefcase
1:23:32
briefcase briefcase all right let's see what we have here
1:23:41
and see if this works so we have a briefcase briefcase briefcase
1:23:47
we need something rather simple a lot of these things are pretty
1:23:53
complicated um this is free
1:23:59
maybe this is it's good let's try this
1:24:06
details download let's see how that if that works
1:24:14
shutterstock login i actually have a shutterstock login
1:24:20
all right let's see if that works
1:24:28
okay so now we're like briefcase
1:24:35
briefcase briefcase full of money that was nice
1:24:40
price uh was there free yeah free okay
1:24:47
so let's try this again download
1:24:52
bam i don't want to tell you what my industry is move that out of the way
1:25:03
how do i download download choose this
1:25:12
do i just pick what i want to download here um let's see i don't even know
1:25:19
let's do the object let's see what this thing can render
1:25:26
import 3d model okay so we can um import the object this
1:25:34
is nice all right so we have an object here let's move it
1:25:42
okay now it stands on the ground um
1:25:48
[Music] and i wonder i don't even know if we have a camera here on this scene
1:25:57
uh how do we see the camera if we have a camera if we go to render what would happen
1:26:11
cloud rendering is how to turn us you can get faster with cloud rendering
1:26:17
okay wait a second we didn't have maybe we need to pick up
1:26:23
some scenes of how we'd like so we want this three-pointed lights
1:26:30
do we is it too much we want to give this
1:26:35
some kind of i want to give this thing
1:26:42
the right color so let's pick the right color here
1:26:47
base color we want this to be purple we want this what do we have in the past
1:26:53
this is golden thing this is purplishy this is purple and
1:27:02
um let's let's experiment how about we experiment
1:27:11
and let's see let's take this one
1:27:22
okay so we have this material
1:27:33
what do we do what is this translucent okay so this one is
1:27:40
purple now this one they all got the same thing
1:27:45
i don't know okay
1:27:51
i turned the suitcase purple okay let's go to render and see if this
1:27:56
works actual size cloud in beta
1:28:02
psd png start with psd and let's do
1:28:08
suit case test quality high
1:28:15
let's do fast first and then save to
1:28:21
no no no this is do the local render do the local render please
1:28:28
save to desktop render let's start with the low quality just see that we're in the right direction
1:28:40
okay
1:28:46
might be nice i'm not sure how the shadows are going to render and whether
1:28:52
um well we'll see in a second if this gives me like a translucent psd
1:28:59
that i can place on the actual page so we have this
1:29:04
let's open it up and see okay okay so the nice thing is i can remove
1:29:11
the background and then i can place it on whatever i want
1:29:18
so if i would take this it's not perfect but i just want to see
1:29:24
if we're going in the right direction if i would put this here
1:29:41
let's do this with the shadows and everything copy
1:29:47
merged let's see how this comes to life
1:29:56
i think actually this can be potentially not bad uh the background needs to be cleaned up
1:30:03
obviously the suitcase can have a
1:30:10
more interesting so previously we've had these kind of like a gradient
1:30:16
gradient type um
1:30:21
gradient type textures and they were also a little bit more solid like
1:30:28
so let's see what we can try and do but i think overall we're going in the right direction and it wasn't very hard so let
1:30:34
me see i'm going to do this and i just want to create like a gradient here
1:30:42
not a radial just a linear gradient between this and this
1:30:48
and i'm going to export this let's do like four times jpeg
1:30:56
as a texture because i saw that i can use this as a let's call this flux
1:31:02
grad texture
1:31:09
um and let's see let's see if this works so let's jump back into dimension
1:31:16
adobe dimension okay i need to also i don't know if this
1:31:22
lights studio that i've made is good
1:31:28
let's try something else let's try this key something something
1:31:33
try a different lighting and see if we like it in the meanwhile while we're at it let's take this and
1:31:40
try to change this from basic color to an image and then let's choose this
1:31:47
gradient
1:31:54
so this can look cool but something weird is happening in the
1:32:01
middle because maybe this
1:32:06
is all of these panels this has something inside of it that is
1:32:12
weird in terms of how this is structured
1:32:18
what is pivot no this is not what i try to do
1:32:23
select material repeat roughness metallic let's put in
1:32:30
the a little bit more metallic translucent no it's not translucent
1:32:37
properties i don't know i don't know let's see okay so frame selection
1:32:44
okay can i just do
1:32:50
how did this frame selection work frame selection
1:32:57
frame selection camera undo
1:33:06
camera redo camera bookmarks
1:33:12
let's do dolly tool okay pan out a little bit okay
1:33:25
okay let's go to render again and see what we've got now
1:33:32
let's keep it on this for now on the test low quality let's replace the one that we have see
1:33:39
what happens
1:34:03
all right so something with the gradient that we did here doesn't work well okay so we can't use it
1:34:11
as it is now one thing that i'm thinking about trying is
1:34:16
just maybe flipping flipping the suitcase around maybe this doesn't happen on the other side
1:34:24
uh so let's take this let's try to rotate it oh
1:34:29
did you see it worked it worked on the other side there's no problem
1:34:36
okay so the only thing that i'm asking myself right now
1:34:41
is what about all of these shadows three point light or studio key light
1:34:50
okay because i don't want all of the noise in the background
1:34:56
maybe i need to put the intensity a little higher i don't know okay so let's go to render
1:35:04
and now i want to do this high quality
1:35:09
just to see that it works png what is the size of this render
1:35:15
actual size fit the screen render
1:35:20
okay let's see what happens now this is really low quality we'll have to see how we
1:35:27
change this to to make the image bigger
1:35:40
but it looks i think it's starting to look better so while it's rendering
1:35:45
let's open up google and adobe
1:35:51
dimension render size render
1:35:56
size creating high definition resolution
1:36:01
using dimension all right
1:36:07
so not sure what you're looking for
1:36:12
my god why can't you just give me the simple solution select environment size
1:36:18
rendering and exporting
1:36:25
render export okay
1:36:35
rendering cloud better render settings in dimension file now you can
1:36:41
find the options views expert file name quality
1:36:48
expert path format rendering times
1:36:54
but where is size there's nowhere here size okay cloud render is free for all blah blah
1:37:01
blah blah during the beta we automatically add the noise into the final render cloud written have size
1:37:07
limit of but where else do you set the size okay
1:37:12
rendering time result is the size of the image right okay so i'm still not sure where you
1:37:18
change the size okay
1:37:25
rendering and exporting how to render working with canvas size
1:37:34
i don't know then render size is it not clear isn't my isn't my google query
1:37:40
uh clear i don't know okay
1:37:46
looks good looks good uh we're going to have to
1:37:52
clean up the shadings here uh but overall i think it's starting to look good i wonder if it's a little bit
1:38:00
too bright okay you know what i'm gonna cancel for a second just because if we're gonna try
1:38:07
and do something with the 20 minutes that we have left we have to start working fast so i'm just going to
1:38:14
uh render again at low quality
1:38:22
uh why can i render status never mind i want to re-render as a low
1:38:29
quality okay thank you oh actually can i open this save copy as
1:38:37
psd this work let's see
1:38:49
i'll do the renders later later on but so what is the size here
1:38:58
okay it's very small uh definitely not enough for me to work
1:39:03
with right now um
1:39:11
and one more thing that i'm noticing is that it's rendering the shade together with
1:39:18
a suitcase so it's going to make my life harder when i try to clean it up but that's not for today let's just see
1:39:26
if it fits in terms of the um
1:39:31
in terms of the frame and everything let's go back to figma and put it here
1:39:40
nope wait uh let's remove the background copy
1:39:48
merged jump back to figma and
1:39:54
actually it was better i think where it was purple because the background is pinkish
1:40:01
so it was actually better the other way around it was actually better the other
1:40:06
way around also in terms of the yeah the side the angle
1:40:15
so i think we should probably stick to this
1:40:20
okay so basically what i want to do right now is
1:40:27
in in in adobe dimension
1:40:33
i wonder if i should have them all on one
1:40:40
and render them one next to another let's
1:40:45
just to start with let's bring it back to how it was previously
1:40:52
and let's change the color back to purple
1:40:58
yep because this was just better now what is the canvas size how do i oh
1:41:05
this is the canvas size i see it now how do i change the canvas size got it
1:41:13
so let's do the canvas size maybe 4 000
1:41:19
on 4 000 i don't know on
1:41:26
2000 at least and then we can zoom out here a little bit
1:41:35
okay so
1:41:41
this is our suitcase but we need to bring in now
1:41:47
target let's see if we have here a target
1:41:53
so 3d models target do you have a
1:41:58
target to give me for free
1:42:03
let's go here tar get
1:42:09
archer target that's great for free
1:42:17
we do have some for free although it's it's a complicated object
1:42:24
i don't know oh and it's not a free object as well we have these targets
1:42:35
what do we already have in terms of targets we have this but is this going to be a good fit with
1:42:43
what we already have here
1:42:52
i don't think it's going to be a good fit it's nice that with the shadow it looks like it's standing on this path
1:42:59
so target yeah that's not going to work what else do we have
1:43:05
if i'm in adobe dimension and they have your stock what do they have
1:43:12
show me what you've got adobe target
1:43:19
target target target everything is everything is super sophisticated and
1:43:25
i'm looking for something simple looking for something simple
1:43:33
actually you know what i also think that a compass
1:43:39
this is a lot what we talk in the course that strategy is like compass so maybe compass is a good thing
1:43:45
yeah
1:43:52
what do you have as oh this is nice this is actually good
1:43:59
these are also good i like this i like this the most
1:44:08
where you are and where you want to go let's do download i have no idea how this will work but
1:44:14
let's do download for this map
1:44:20
let's bring it in
1:44:32
let's okay so now we have this here
1:44:38
let's bring it close to let's put it down at the ground
1:44:45
now it's touching the ground maybe we need to take it
1:44:51
to
1:44:59
resuming out a little bit maybe we need to
1:45:08
do we need to scale this
1:45:16
and we need to change all of them to purple
1:45:21
so now we're going to have to go inside and change colors to
1:45:27
all of these things
1:45:34
i wish there was a way to apply the colors to everything
1:45:40
is it applied to everything
1:45:47
it is not
1:45:54
some things should be easier than they are right now if i'm choosing all of these things
1:46:03
why can i not apply
1:46:09
i'm just trying to apply a color it shouldn't be so manual and tedious
1:46:16
to do this for each one of these things
1:46:22
oh my god it's going to take forever
1:46:33
okay friends so as we are nearing our s
1:46:38
second almost second hour of this live stream
1:46:44
uh i don't know if to admit to failure you know i'm
1:46:49
i'm trying to because i didn't finish my goal was to finish this one in the middle i want to make it
1:46:55
pinkish so let's bring the pink color before i admit failure
1:47:00
because i didn't finish everything and now i'm going to have to do this tomorrow as well
1:47:05
and i had other plans for tomorrow so
1:47:13
welcome to the life of a designer and this looks all right this looks good
1:47:24
just go to quickly to render first of all i'm going to save this so because i haven't saved it yet so i'm going to
1:47:30
call this branding path 3ds
1:47:37
very important to save your work render low fast
1:47:42
render okay okay
1:47:49
oh i also now remember that i turned it into 4000 pixels so now this is this might take
1:47:56
longer to render it does take longer to
1:48:02
render okay so while this is rendering let's recap what we have and where we
1:48:08
are right now so basically i've finished laying out all of this page
1:48:14
but i do have i want to complete this path of 3d objects then i need to create a mock-up for the course which is going
1:48:21
to be quite similar to what we have here kind of a mock-up with a
1:48:28
laptop and some visuals from the course itself this is done this is done and
1:48:34
then we have these things which actually are going to be variations on what we
1:48:40
already have here but with new visuals so there's probably a good
1:48:47
two more hours into this into creating the visuals and i will try to finish this up
1:48:54
tomorrow let's see what's dimension is telling us it's not bad
1:49:03
not bad it's going to look nice i think this
1:49:08
is going to look nice when we bring it on top so overall i think it's a cute idea
1:49:16
for the path let's just screenshot this and see how it looks
1:49:31
[Music]
1:49:40
okay so my computer also can't handle doing renders and
1:49:46
live streaming at the same time but let's
1:49:51
put this on blend multiply just to see
1:50:01
so i think this is pretty cool i wonder if we should put the
1:50:10
the name of the steps the name of the steps here like closing
1:50:17
a project you know strategy or we leave this kind of like vague so people can
1:50:23
say ooh what are what is this cool process i want to learn this cool process
1:50:28
okay adobe dimension i'm going to close this up right now so
1:50:34
we can wrap up the live stream for today
1:50:39
let me let me go back here into the camera all right so
End of stream
1:50:45

1:50:51

---


hello and welcome back this is rafi once again in today's video i'm going to show you how i have created
0:11
this beautiful mobile responsive landing page step by step from the scratch so this
0:17
landing page is quite a long one as you can see so to cover the full tutorial i might have
0:24
to make two or three separate videos but you are going to get every single
0:31
steps in those videos for sure so let me show you this image which has uh
0:37
these um border ideas looking great as you can see i'm going to cover all of these things we have got this
0:44
section where we have got in one column we have got image another column we have text
0:49
byte now button and then we have got this payment information and if you just notice here we have got
0:56
these comparison tables and then have got this tab wheels we have got this freaking in frequent class
1:02
questions we have got these functionalities as well so just take a look so i am going to cover
1:08
everything throughout this course step by step but for the first video this in this video
1:14
i'm going to cover from this section this section and this section these three section will be
1:21
covered so without further ado let me take you to my um wordpress dashboard and at the very beginning you
1:28
have to install two um plugins one is elementor builder and
1:33
another one is essential add-ons for elementor so let me show you the plugins if you are beginner it will be helpful i
1:40
believe so from plugins i'm going to click on add new and after coming here simply type out
1:46
ili mentor and it is going to load plugins here
1:52
so as you can see here this one is important element to website builder and then we have got essential add-ons
1:58
for elementor so both of these plugins have been installed on my wordpress website and both of them are activated
2:06
as well so you have to do the same for your website and now after that you
2:11
are going to see this template section so from here you can see your saved templates you can
2:17
add a new template so i'm going to add click on add new template by clicking here
2:23
and then i'm going to give the name actually choose the type of the template
2:28
so as it is a page so i'm going to select page from here and after that from name i'm going to
2:34
give the name let's say lp um 1 or let's say 2
2:40
or lp 1 c c okay so i'm going to keep it with this name
2:46
uh you can type out whatever you want based on your need or based on your
2:52
goal okay so let's click on create template here and it is going to load the elementor
2:58
editing page and here we go we have got this one
3:04
here and it has got some of the default things here which we don't need we need
3:09
to start from the scratch and we don't need these um random stuffs here so
3:15
to get this pretty clean we have to simply go here in this gear icon
3:20
in the settings and then click here in this gear and then you are going to find this option you can change the title of
3:26
your page which we have just given so i'd love to keep it as it is you can select the status from draft to anything
3:32
but let's keep it draft it is going to be published soon after i click on publish but before that i
3:38
have to change the page layout here so let's click from default let's change it to elementor can
3:44
bus so let's click it and then click on publish
3:49
and here we go hooray your page is live and if we just reload this page
3:55
we are going to see that we have got a blank template here we have got nothing all right so here we
4:02
go we are ready to go for the next step so here as you can see we have got this header this one is another header
4:10
and then we have got these um uh two sections okay here two columns
4:16
here and then we have got paragraph and then one image and the other stuff so let's just make the
4:22
um basic things first so very at the very beginning what i'd love to do i'd
4:27
love to do some formattings here and i'm going to actually i'm going to do some
4:32
universal formattings or universal color selections let's go for it we're going to
4:37
click on this hamburger icon and then go to site settings and after that from global
4:44
global colors as you can see and global phones i'm going to make some changes here so for global colors
4:50
i'm going to select as you can see these are already been selected because i have worked on the previous project so let's delete
4:58
them and i won't be able to delete the default ones from here so let me show you how you can take the
5:05
global colors and it is going to help you speed up the working process of any elementor project so first of all
5:11
let's say i want to get this color and to get color codes of these
5:17
different colors i'd love to use one tool named pixie so p i x i e
5:24
and the name is here nationwide pixie so let's click on it and download this one as a
5:31
portable application i'm going to save file
5:36
and it's been saved here now let's open it up and here we go now what it is going to
5:42
do it is as you can see here we'll be able to copy colors by using control plus alter plus c uh keys in your
5:49
keyboard so let's say i want to get this colors code so if i as you can see it's been selected
5:55
if i type ctrl alt copy in my keyboard now if i paste it here you are going to
6:01
see that i have got the color code already here so this is the use of pixie and we are
6:07
going to use this tool here so let me just take you here all right now another tool we are going to use
6:15
which is what is font as you can see here this one so if you just type out here what is
6:23
uh font extension for chrome or moji life you are using chrome
6:28
that's fine or you can simply what font extension firefox you are going to find this um extension
6:35
which i am using this one as you can see and you are going to see the work of this extension within few minutes all
6:42
right so now i am going to change the colors at the very beginning so let's go for this color i have just
6:49
hovered over uh over the cursor here on the color and as you can see here i have got the
6:55
orange color already here as you can see this one just take a look here when i am
7:00
taking this carson into the orange color here and now if i uh hit ctrl alt
7:07
copy in my keyboard and i have already copied the code so now let's click on
7:12
add color sorry not this one so let's click on add color and then
7:17
here simply ctrl v and just take a look i have got the color code here added so now let's say
7:24
uh orange and after that i'm going to get another color which is
7:31
this one um which we have got for most of the titles of the page so i'm going to
7:36
again ctrl alt copy and this pixie tool is going to work in the background
7:41
so don't worry about this until you just cross it out so i'm going to type out let's say
7:47
this color is little bit blue and after that i have got this um
7:53
color i'm going to take heading this black color for all of the
7:58
paragraphs so i'm going to delete this one i'd love to go with
8:04
this primary color whenever i need so let's go for the work
8:11
we have got our colors so let's click on update and now let's refresh this page
8:24
and it is going to load up again the same blank page and it's time to go for color adding up
8:31
our contents here so let's go for it we are going to take one column from here and we are
8:36
going to take heading the first heading and then you have got the second heading and one thing
8:42
you can simply uh change the text as well but i'd love to keep this text as it is
8:47
and then let's go for it we are going to get another heading here and after that
8:54
we have got two columns so let's take two inner sections
8:59
and then we have got another paragraph here not here okay so let's go to widgets and then
9:06
text editor okay so we have got the basic structure of the first
9:11
section and it's time to copy and paste these contents so i'm going to copy these contents and then i'm going to
9:18

9:24
contents already so let's give it to center alignment as you have got them here now let's go for this one we are going
9:31
to paste it and we're going to take it to center as well
9:38
and we're going to do all the rest of the formatting soon okay and then we have got this image so
9:45
let me upload the image we have to drag this image part into this column
9:51
and select the image from here simply you can upload image from this page but as i already have uploaded the image
9:59
as i have worked on this template earlier for my client so let's just select this image and insert i've got them here and
10:06
then we have got this icon list so let me show you how we can add this icon list
10:14
and we're going to customize this soon so let's go for these these messages
10:21
not here okay so there is message so i'm going to
10:26
paste them here and i'm going to take them to center let's come back here later
10:33
okay so now let's start from changing the background color
10:39
changing the background color to the original color so i'm going to copy the color code from here ctrl alt copy as we
10:44
have got the pixie working in the background and then i have to click on these six dots here
10:50
go to style and then simply click on background type then color then paste it here and just
10:57
take a look we have got the background color alright so it's working nice or looking nice and then let's go back here
11:04
and we are going to change the section white so the section white
11:10
is going to be like 960 960 is going to look nice though it's
11:18
not looking nice now but it is going to look nice soon okay and now let's change the color of
11:23
this text to white and just take a look how it is going to look like and
11:29
before i proceed on this color doing i'm going to um get the
11:35
formattings or the fonts and other information from here so let's click here
11:40
and let's select this one it is going to show me the font is lotto and the font size is 64 pixels
11:47
and the font weight is 400 so let's go for it we are going to change the typography
11:55
lotto is selected 64 pixels and then 700 pixels so it should be 400 pixels
12:01
and here we go we have got the formatting correct now it's time to
12:07
change the color of this text so let's do this we are going to change the color of the text
12:12
by clicking here go to content and then we have to select the text which is long
12:18
form sales page and take them into spawn tag okay so we are going to
12:24
put here spawn tech these are css works pawn and then close them
12:30

12:49
i want it to orange and i would love to give a id or the class name
12:54
to orange or and now if i take you to advance
12:59

13:14
we are going to take the color code from here ctrl alt copy and paste it here
13:22
add hashtag and just take a look we have got our color done here but these texts are a little
13:30
um baldy so we are going to increase the font weight as well so let's go for font
13:38
weight to 700 and just take a look we have got the proper formatting here for
13:43
this section and now let's go for the second heading and we are going to see
13:49
the formatting's information here so again it has lotto 30 pixels
13:54
and the font weight is 300 so let's go for it we are going to change it from here to
14:01
white and then we have got typography 30 pixel
14:07
300 pixel oh sorry 300 font weight and just take a look we have got this
14:12
done as well so we are going to work on this padding stuff later but let's go for
14:18
setting up this um icon list so let's go back here
14:23
and we are going to change the icon then we have got these white text so let's
14:29
copy this text and i'm going to delete two of them and i'm going to show you
14:35
how to do these stuffs faster so i've just selected and then i'm going
14:40
to place the text here and then let's change this now icon from here to
14:47
icon library and let's say um right arrow okay so this one okay so as you
14:54
can see i've been using this one so let's select this one click on insert and it is looking too small so we're
15:01
going to work on this and we're going to change the color obviously so let's go to style and
15:07
after that we are going to icon change the color to white and
15:14
the size let's say we want 20 size and after that let's go for the
15:21
text we are going to um change the color to white
15:27
and if i just see what is the font okay so it is gentium
15:34
gentium basic plus 22 pixels plus 400 okay so let's change the text
15:42

15:48
basic 22 pixel 400 so it's already been selected as i have been working on this
15:53
earlier so it's already selected so now what we have to do we have to simply duplicate this

16:32
paste here and here we go so now if you just notice here we have got some spacings in
16:38
between these um icons icon list so let me show you how we can give the spacings
16:44
go to style again from icon uh okay so not from icon let me see okay
16:50
from space as you can see if we just increase the spaces as you can see here let's give it to 20
16:57
and it is looking nice isn't it just let me know by commenting below okay
17:02
so here we go now we have got this text which should be um italic
17:10
and then the color should be white so let me show you how we can change this as well
17:15
simply select actually click here go to style change the color to white and the
17:21
alignment is centered and go to typography from style we are
17:26
going to change it to italic and just take a look how it is looking like now so if i simply

18:31
be rounded and the size as you can see here it is it is little smaller so let's see
18:38
the size uh from content we are going to give the size to custom and the white
18:46
let's say 120 apply and i guess yes 150
18:54
would look nice here 150 pixels all right so it's looking
18:59
nice right so now how we can place it here instead of this place so now if i take it here it is just staying
19:07
at the same place but let me show you how you can take this to this place actually here so simply go to advanced
19:15
and after that go to positioning and then from positioning as you can see
19:20
here position default is selected but click on absolute select the absolute
19:26
but you should not use absolute too much for better performance of your website so
19:32
let me just drag it here drag it to this part all right and make sure it is
19:40
centered so i hope it is centered uh actually not this is centered okay so it's looking
19:46
nice right so now what i have to do i have to take another section so let's go for another section and
19:54

25:46
change the color for some reason i don't know why but we can simply skip this color um
25:51

28:56
web builder is and one thing i'd love to show you as you can see here readers are in italic and then we have got the
29:02
bold things so let's say you want to use or make this single as
29:07

29:14
simply select the text and then choose the formattings as you want okay
29:19
so this was it for this section now let's go back to
29:24
our next section which is this one and we're going to work on this this is going to be really
29:30
easy so let's click on plus and set this section here
29:36
and we're going to give take this section actually give this section a white of 960 pixels
29:43

30:26
now let's copy this one and paste them into our text field
30:32

30:37
formattings 44 pixels and 400 and this should be laddus lotto so let
30:44

30:52
yes and now we want to change their okay centered
30:59
now we want to change the color to orange and the text should be bold or little
31:05

31:13
about we are going to take the spawn tag again spawn text started and we are going to
31:21
close the spontak here and in the first spawn tag we are going
31:27
to take a class equal to we are going to name
31:32

32:01
take another class and we are going to give like big
32:08

32:14
update and i'm actually going to test it out if i was able to do this
32:20

32:33
show you again uh this tag this stacks are font weight in 700
32:39
but when i am selecting the whole text the font to it is 400 so we are done so
32:45
this was the process okay so now let's go back again and we are going to change the color of this
32:50
text to white so let's click here to get the editing panel click here go
32:57
to style change the color of the text to white all right yes so this was it so let's add some tweaks to
33:05
make it more closer to our original template as you can see here we have got some spacings in between
33:12
these um first header and then this this header and this sections of this um
33:17
inner section so let me take you back here and then let's just remove the default
33:25
formattings from this page i'm going to remove everything from default formatting
33:30
let's remove go to advanced default formatting everything has been removed now let's go
33:38
back here from default formatting let's change everything and we have got the broken
33:43
page but don't worry we are going to work on this soon so now i am going to give a padding
33:49
to 50 pixel on top and i don't need the right and left sorry
33:57
50 pixel on top and let's delete the right and left and 50 vision so we have got here
34:05
top 50 and bottom 50 so we are going to get this exact spacings here okay and then
34:12
we are going to get some spacings for these tags so i'm going to select this
34:18
one and then we are going to do some padding thing here so let's say i want 20 pixel to the top
34:27
and 20 20 pixel to the bottom of this text and just take a look how it is
34:33
going to look like and now let's let me just review again okay so i missed to add the border of
34:40
this section so let's add the border here so let's select it and then from
34:46
style you are going to find border and you are going to put like let's say i
34:52
want to give one pixel and change the color as you can see oops i have added border radius this should
34:58
not be done but let's keep it or we can simply select to zero okay and from here border
35:05
type let's select solid and then this border size is going to be one pixel
35:13
and the color is going to be white for sure okay so just take a look how it is going
35:19
to look like all right and here we go okay so now i want to give some paintings
35:26
here for these paragraph text so let me do this let's go back here select this one and
35:33
go to advanced and remove the preformattings and padding select this one
35:40
actually unselect and after that on top we are going to give the padding of let's say 20 pixels
35:46
and on bottom we want 20 pixels as well now let's just drag the image in the
35:53
right place and drop it okay
35:58
and here we go all right so now it is going to look much closer to our original web page
36:05
or original design which you have been following right so let's see yes okay
36:12
so i might have to add some spaces right here go back to advance or
36:19
let's say from navigation we are going to select this section style actually advanced let's remove
36:27
this styling and we're going to start from um let's say 50 not 50 50 is just too
36:36
low for this section so i'm going to take let's say 100 pixel because we have got this image
36:41
here and it is going to look nice here from right we don't need any anything from left we don't need
36:48
anything but in bottom we are going to keep 50 pixels which is going to look nice and then we
36:53
are going to remove the spacings of this section as well and we are going to
36:59
give 50 pixel to top and 50 pixels to bottom and it is going to look nicer
37:05

39:14
tutorial series and in this video i'm going to cover this section which has this special paragraph widget
39:20
which has a background and a border and then we are going to add this icon box we are going to add this
39:28
feature list and then we are going to work on this section for sure and then we are going to work on this
39:33
special section which has some custom coding stuffs and we are going to place this image
39:38
nicely so without further ado let me show you the first video which uh we have
39:44
done um actually the first video of this series this this one i'm going to attach the link of this video into the video
39:51
description for you so that if you have missed this video you should watch this because let me
39:56
show you what we have done in the first video i'm going to take you here and then let's
40:01
view this template and here in the first video we have covered this header
40:07
section we have um changed these colors as you can see these are custom coded colors
40:13
we have placed this image by using position and then we have got these sections as
40:18
well so now as i want to add more contents in this template so i'm going to click on edit with elementor
40:25
and i'm going to omit my youtube channel dashboard from here actually the videos list and then i'm going to omit this one
40:32
as well so that will have only two tabs which will be easily navigational or navigateable okay so let
40:38
me take you to the bottom of this page and we are going to add contents right here and let me take you a little bit up
40:46
here okay so here in this section we have got one header or heading we have got this paragraph
40:53
but we are going to take these paragraphs in three widgets so that will be able to customize this
40:58
middle one easily so uh and after that we have got one heading and one paragraph so let us let me take
41:04
the structure first one heading three paragraph one heading one paragraph here so let me
41:10
take you here and then i'm going to take your widgets here we are already in the widget section so let's
41:15
take this heading here and after that i'm going back to widgets again and then i'm going to take text editor
41:23
and i can simply duplicate this one here duplicate again and i need again this uh
41:29
header section so let me take you to widgets heading and after that i need another
41:36
text editor here so we have got the basic structure of this part okay and then we are going to
41:43
take a section here actually inner section and we are going to work take uh these
41:50
um what to say icon box so let me take them so first of all click here and i'm going
41:55
to type out icon and here we go icon box we're going to take it here okay so let's keep it as it is and
42:03
we are going to go for the rest within few minutes but before that we are going to i'd love to um show you the
42:10
customization of this part so let's go back here in our editing section or the editing page and after that here
42:17
as you can see the title here so i'm going to copy the title which has some text with some bold texts here
42:25
and you are going to see how easily we are going to customize all of these things and we're going to match all of these things
42:30
up easily so here let's come back again and click on this header or heading and then
42:37
we are going to select and paste the content which we have copied now let's give the element of this text
42:43
to center and let's go back here and we're going to get the
42:48
measurement of these fonts so i'm going to use this font finder finder extension which i talked about in
42:55
my previous video so let's click here and then i'm going to click here so that it will show me the font
43:02
family as you can see lotto then the font size then the font weight and other information as you can see
43:08
here so i'm going to change it to 44 pixel font size and 400 phone to it and uh obviously
43:16
this is lotto font family so 44 pixels so i'm going back here going to style
43:22
click on typography and it is currently selected to 64 so let's change it to 44 pixels sorry
43:29
44 pixel and the font weight is going to be 400 for the basic one and if you want to
43:36
change the color simply you can change the color if you need but we don't need to change the color for
43:41
this um part so let's go back again and we have got this special sentence or let's say three
43:49
words where we have to play some bold things or do some font weight so let me just show
43:56
you how we can do this with custom code so first of all we have to select these three uh words
44:01
so let's go back here i'm going to click again click on contain and here before simple i have to take
44:09
spam tag and after rule i have to take spawn tag
44:15
uh sorry i have to in the spawn tag spawn okay and here i have to take a class
44:23
equal to double quotation and as in our previous video we have done some custom coding and we have called
44:30
some of the some of the sections or some of the headings already as you can see here we have got the styling
44:36
so we are going to call this custom css um selector or actually the class
44:43
name okay so that it will get this formatting here automatically so let me show you we used big and drastic look we have got
44:51
big or the font weight already been increased so it is really really helping us to get our work
44:57
done faster all right so we have got this header completed now let's go for the
45:03
paragraph so i'm going to copy the paragraph and i i could be or i should i'd be able to
45:11
um i'd be able to go with the what to say the demo contents but i'd love to copy
45:17
and paste all the information from here because i want to give you the actual
45:22
taste of this project or these types of projects so let me just copy and paste everything from here so that it will
45:27
look realistic okay so here i have taken all of these contents for these sections
45:34
now in this paragraph we have got this background and padding for all of these sites from left
45:42
from right from top from border bottom so let's let me show you how i can do and take padding stuffs and how you can
45:48
place this background and border so let me take you back to the editing panel here and we are already been clicked here so
45:56
now let's go to advance and after that as you can see here padding let's keep it selected as it is and then
46:03
if you just place let's say 35 and or 25 whatever it's needed so if you
46:09
pick 25 it is going to be lower and let me see i think it is 30 so
46:16
i'm going to take 30 here okay so 30 painting for top right bottom
46:21
left okay so all of these places has got the got the spaces right
46:28
so now what i'm going to do i'm going to give a background of this section so if you just take a
46:34
look here background so let's click on it and then it is already selected on normal then click on this classic icon
46:41
then choose the color so i'm going to click here and let's go back here and i'm going to take the color of this background by using
46:48
pixi the tool which i talked about in my previous video so let me open pixie here
46:54
sorry p i x i e the tool which is going to help me get the color codes easily as
47:00
you can see here control alter plus copy and you are going to get the html code so let me hover over here
47:06
and hit ctrl alter c in my keyboard and it already copied the color code now let me go back here
47:14
and then i'm going to paste the color code here and just take a look we have got these sections background color
47:20
changed right so now we have got a border uh so if i just commit it and just take
47:27
a look we don't have a burden right now but if you go back here you have got a border so let me show you how you can
47:32
add the border so here is the border option in advanced again so let's click on border
47:38
and then here from border type you have to select solid double dot air dash and group so whatever you want so i'd
47:44
love to go with solid as it is provided on our actual page here so let's go back again
47:49
and then from here it has got the default values but we are going to select our own so i'm going to select
47:56
it again and then i'm going to keep one pixel for all of these sides right so now if i just omit it and
48:04
actually um just take a look here okay so we have
48:09
got these borders added now let's expand it here so that our edit editing panel will be available and
48:15
let's go back here which what else we have got here we have got this section actually this header so let's copy and
48:22
go back here and i'm going to paste them here and let's do the formatting we have got
48:28
let me check out the font size this one is 34 latto and 400 so 34 pixels so let me
48:36
change actually let's give the center alignment first go to style go to typography and it is going to be
48:42
34 and 400 weight right and then we don't have to do anything i
48:48
guess yes we don't have to do anything here now let's copy this paragraph and i'm
48:54
going to paste this paragraph here i'm doing it faster because we have covered many things in our previous
48:59
video so i don't think i should explain everything here but still i'll be able to i'd love to
49:05
give all the hints that needed okay so now let's work on this um a special
49:11
section where you have to add these um icon boxes with this information and
49:16
icons so let me just copy and paste these paragraphs here i've just copied i'm
49:22
just clicked here and if you just notice here we have got the description field where you have to enter our description and if you notice we
49:29
don't have a header or the title here so we are going to remove the title we are going to
49:34
delete the title from here and it's been banished now we can simply click here and
49:41
click on icon library to change the live icon so here we have got a paper plane so i'm going to
49:46
make a search here paper and just take a look we have got paper plane here so let's click on it
49:52
insert and we have got the paper plane now let's customize a little more as you can see we have got this border
49:58
uh which is rounded border and then we have got some padding stuffs as well so let me take you back here we
50:04
are going to select from view we are going to uh click on framed and then circle is
50:09
already selected but you will be able to add square as well if you want but we are going with circle
50:15
and after that we have to click on style then you can simply increase the size
50:23
of this um of this icon and the circle as you can see here
50:28
padding if you want okay so you can simply increase the padding so i think this is the
50:34
accurate side okay and then we have got this border white so it is a little big than our original
50:42
um document here so let me take you back here and we are going to click here and then
50:47
again click and now if i click on let's say one pixel we are going to find everything is
50:53
fine here matching up with your document now let me show you one thing which is uh really funny so if i just
50:58
delete one from one side just take a look it is going to get some custom
51:04
stylus okay so let's say i want to lay in the top and bottom and just take a look how it is looking
51:09
like so you can actually customize these things so i'm if i just put let's say five here just take a look how it is
51:15
going to look like so i'm going to go with one only but you can customize as you want
51:20
so it was my intention to show you some of the work so i just covered all right so here i have got
51:27
them these paragraphs which are already in centered aligned
51:32
actually the icon also centered aligned and what else i have to do i have to do nothing
51:37
for now for this one but what i have to do i have to copy actually duplicate this one so that
51:43
i'll have another section i have to duplicate another time so that will have three icons and now
51:49
if we just click here on the right button of our mouse and then click on delete this part will be deleted
51:55
now it is going to be easier for us to customize everything so let me click here on the icon and
52:00
let's go back here we have got this horn so i'm going to here
52:05
and then click on icon library then search for horn and which is bullhorn here so let's
52:12
select this one click on insert and here we go we have got this icon added now let's go back again here and then we
52:19
have got this bulb so i'm going to click here then change the bulb uh change it to bulb oops
52:27
bulb and select this one click on insert and here you have got this bulb as well
52:33
added so i'm not going to change these tags because there is a basic thing just copy pasting so
52:38
i i'd love to keep them as it is and then i'm going to work on these sections
52:43
okay so here we have got something to learn new so i'm going to add um let me see yes
52:50
these are in one section so i'm going to take one header again here and after that we have got
52:59
on the feature list so let me take you back here then widgets then fda
53:05
okay so here we go feature list and i'm going to add it here all right here we go we have got this
53:13
featured list i'm going to delete few all right so we are going to work on one and then we are going to duplicate it so
53:18
that it will help us speeding up our working process so this is a trick okay so now what i am going to do i am
53:25
going to copy this text copy and paste it here
53:31
and then i'm going to copy the style of this section because we have got a very similar style
53:36
into this section as well so i'm going to paste style and here we go we have got the style okay so this is a way of
53:43
speeding up your working process and then we have got these things so we are going to work on this
53:49
so i'm going to copy the title from here sorry copy the title from here and
53:55
click here so that will have this feature item options so let's click on it and you're going to be able to change
54:01
the icon change the title so first of all let me change the title here which i have just copied and then i'm going to copy this um
54:09
paragraph as well or the description so i'm going to paste them here so here we go we have got the
54:14
title and the description and the icon so now i want to change the icon to this icon
54:20
so let me click here on icon library and then i think this one is the icon so let me
54:26
click on insert and it is going to be updated and if you just take a look here
54:32
i'm going to see um icon shape circle shape view is going to
54:40
be framed so that it is going to take the background as you can see
54:45
and then what else we can do here nothing so let's go to style
54:50
and we are going to work on space between letter but it's not mandatory as of now so let's
54:56
click on icon and then we can change the icon size from here so let's keep it to
55:02
4v and i think it's looking good and you can change the icon size as well
55:08
if you want to keep it to 15 you will be able to do this or whatever size you want you can change the padding as well so
55:14
let me show you how painting works so here it is currently selected to 15 but if i give 20
55:20
uh 25 just take a look it's just increased so if i go with 35 it is going
55:27
to increase more so actually 355 been happened so i'm going to go back to 15 which is the
55:32
perfect size for me and as you can see border width is selected to one pixel but you can select
55:38
it um two more if you want okay so one is perfect for me and then we are
55:46
going to work on the content so here the header
55:51
sorry the title and the content or description so let's click on content and after that we are going to
55:58
click on typography and first of all let me verify the content size here so let's click on the font finder then
56:05
click here 22 pixel 700 font weight and let's see the descriptions 22 pixel 400
56:13
so 400 and 700 so i'm going to click here and here for the title
56:19
we are going to change the font weight to 700 which is already selected and we have got the okay so i've just
56:25
forgot maybe 24 oh sorry 22 okay so 22 is the size and here you have got
56:33
the proper uh sizing and i think the icon side should be a little smaller and i'm going to change it soon
56:39
so let's work on it we are going back for description typography and gantheon basically
56:45
selected 2200 pixel sorry 400 weight all looks good and it's already been updated here
56:51
now let's work on this icon again so let's click on icon and i want this icon size to let's say
56:58
30 and on the icon size actually the size of this whole thing and then the icon size is 10
57:05
will look good here and i think it's looking good okay so now what i'm going to do i'm going to
57:10
click on content and after that i'm going to click on this copy icon then copy again and now i'm going to
57:17
copy and paste these informations just select click here and then change
57:22
the title and change the description from here
57:27
all right so everything working fine all right so now let me take this one as well copy the title
57:34
and paste it here and let's copy this description paste it here and just take
57:42
a look we have got the whole formatting happening here now i am about to change the background
57:47
color to white as you can see so let's take the code control alt or copy and pixie is taking
57:54
the code now let's go back here let's select the whole section by clicking here and then go to style
58:01
then go to background type to classic change the color i'm going to put white
58:06
and just take a look it's looking real nice here and it looks like it's working so now
58:12
one thing as you can see here uh okay so here
58:19
after this tags we have got some padding or margin so let me just make the correction here
58:24
so it will look nicer so i am going to click here and okay
58:29
so first of all i'd love to remove the padding of this section so let's click here
58:35
go to advanced then click on this icon to remove all the default margin
58:42
and default padding so it is going to look much nicer right now we are going to give some padding
58:47
stuff here for this actually margin stuff for this header so let's click here
58:54
go to advanced and then unselect this one the margin and then give some margin to
59:00
let's say 15 to the top and 15 to the bottom and let's see how it goes
59:05
going to look like and you can actually increase it to 20 to the top and 20 to the bottom and i
59:12
think it's looking it's going to look nice right so if i take a look here yes it's
59:17
looking good but we can still customize more if we need now let's go back again here
59:23
and then we have got this section which is really easy to do but let me show you i am going to take another structure
59:30
here and then we have got one heading one paragraph one heading one program so total two
59:36
heading two paragraphs so i'm going to click here drag this heading
59:41
then go back to widgets drag a text editor then go back to widgets actually we can
59:48
simply duplicate this one okay so they're actually duplicating
59:53
uh this way so i'm going to take heading again and let's take a text editor here and
1:00:00
here we are fine with the structure now let's go back here we are going to copy this uh heading
1:00:06
and then select paste the heading here now let's here just take a look we have
1:00:12
got this color changed and this the solution is going to be bold so let me take the information of
1:00:20
this font 44 pixels 400 is normal with latter so let's go back here
1:00:26
and i i'm going to place it to center style and then lotto 44 pixel
1:00:33
400 is normal and we have to work on this the solution text so i'm going to
1:00:40
click here content and select the solution from here
1:00:45
by using spawn tag which we have been using several times from the beginning so i believe you're
1:00:52
clear already spawn tag and then class equal to
1:01:00
um big okay so it's already been big but we have to change the color of this
1:01:06
text to um this color so i'm going to copy the color code from here ctrl alt
1:01:11
copy and go back here go to style and from text color we are going to
1:01:17
change the color to this color all right so it's working nice and looking nice here
1:01:22
so now let's go back here we are going to copy and paste these paragraphs from here to
1:01:28
here and then i'm going to take this heading here to here and
1:01:36
i'm going to take this paragraph from here to this place okay so now it's looking
1:01:43
nice and we are going to get these um yeah so i think these are
1:01:51
similar so i'm going to copy this style copy and paste this style here
1:01:56
and it is going to look like um similar to the other one so i'm going to make the correction here
1:02:03
so let's select this one click here and then i'm going to use spawntex again
1:02:11
and i believe you already know which class you are going to use here class equal to let me see if you can guess
1:02:18
and let me know if you have guessed it by commenting below so you're going to use big okay so just
1:02:24
take a look how it is going to work and we're going to close the spawn tag and it's totally fine now
1:02:32
let's go for the real funny part and it is the part which is really
1:02:37
important to watch okay so i'm going back here and then we have actually got
1:02:42
two headings one paragraph and then one inner section here so let's go back
1:02:48
here and actually okay so first of all let me change the section color section background color
1:02:55

1:03:02
let's click here and go to style go to background type then click here
1:03:08
then paste the color code here okay so we have got different background color here
1:03:13
now let's go for the fun part we are going to take two headings one paragraph
1:03:20
and one inner section so let's go to widgets heading
1:03:26

1:04:14
and the font weight is 300 and then we have got this content in centered aligned now just take a look we
1:04:21
have got this um bold part again so we are going to do the same repetitive stuff
1:04:27
so let me just spawn type of spawn with a class
1:04:33

for the next one so here i'm going to change the number to 3 and let's go here and
1:14:17
let's select the paragraph from here to this part and paste it here just take
1:14:24
a look now so we have got one separator with some um some white so let's just add
1:14:30
this separator into our work document so let's click here and if i take you to style
1:14:38
you are going to find this divider so let's click on divider and then you'll be able to select the
1:14:45
divider white from here and i think 30 is going to be fine but you can put it to 100
1:14:51
but i'd love to keep it to 30 it is going to look nicer here and as you can see it's just touching
1:14:57
each other so i'm going to give some spacings um let's say 30 or 40 is going to look
1:15:03
nice i guess all right so and from this column or this alignment section you'll be able to
1:15:08
set the alignment as you want but i'd love to keep it left as it is and now we have got this
1:15:14
image which should be a little bit bigger and it should look like this right nice curves so let's go back here
1:15:21
we are going to as you can see here we have got two columns so if i place my mouse cursor here in the middle part i'm
1:15:28
going to be able to drag this thing here so just take a look so if i keep it here
1:15:34
i think it's looking much nicer right so just take a look and if i if you
1:15:42
spend more times on customizing and designing this part you'll be able to design
1:15:47
more beautiful and you'll be able to place this image in a good way so let me just take it to
1:15:53
uh middle and this one also take it to middle and now just take a look how it is
1:15:59
looking like all right so this is how you'll be able to
1:16:05
easily customize and easily put your own custom css codes in your work
1:16:12
right so this was it for the tutorial and in the next tutorial i'm going to update it in the
1:16:19

1:19:40
on we are here to start working i'm going to take you to my working document which you have
1:19:46
built by actually by following the previous video so let me take you
1:19:52
here here here so let's click on edit with elementor to start customizing and
1:19:57
start adding contents and i'm going to omit this one while it is on the editing panel is loading here
1:20:04
okay so let's go to the downside and then we are going to start working
1:20:10
from here where we have got a heading then we have got a section
1:20:15
inner section we have got another intersection we have got another inner section but we are going to work on one inner
1:20:21
section and then we are going to duplicate this to speed up our working process and let
1:20:26
me just show you how you can do this as well to save your time your clients time so let's go back we are going back here
1:20:33
we are going to click on this plus icon and then let's select the structure which is going to be the single column
1:20:39
structure so i'm going to click here and after that as you have got this header
1:20:44
and then i have got two actually two columns here so we are going to take one inner section so let's take header
1:20:51
i'm going to click on widgets then heading let's drag it here and after that let's click here on this
1:20:58
widget and then let's drag this inner section right here okay so we are going to move with these
1:21:03
things only so let's just let me show you how beautifully we are going to place everything so fitted so here you need to copy this
1:21:11
text and click here paste them here and then give the alignment to center
1:21:17
and let's take their size and other information by using this font
1:21:22
finder which i talked about my previous videos so let's click here and we are going to
1:21:28
find this lot of font and then we have got 44 pixels then 400 is the font rate so we are
1:21:34
going to do the setup right here style then typography 44 pixel and the font
1:21:42
weight is 400 pixels sorry for 400 all right so here we go we have got the proper formatting for the heading
1:21:48
now let's go back here we have got this image which we are going to upload now so lets go back here
1:21:55
and in this column let's click on it drag this image widget here and then upload the image from your
1:22:02
computer if you want to upload but i already have got this image in my upload media library which i have
1:22:08
uploaded earlier so i'm going to use it from let's say um here okay
1:22:15
i think this image no okay so this one so i'm going to select which is actually
1:22:20
this one i shouldn't have go here so i'm going to select and then let's click on insert media
1:22:26
and then i'm going to give borders to this image so let's go to style and after
1:22:32
that you are going to find as you can see white and other information and after that we have got this border types if you want you can actually
1:22:38
increase the white a little more uh i'd love to keep it to 30 i think 30 is good
1:22:44
and then i'm going to give the border type as you can see let's select it to none and after that border radius it is the
1:22:51
place where you have to work so we have got this border in right side so we are going to
1:22:58
actually we don't have a border in the right side so we are going to give some um border stuff here let's say 50
1:23:04
pixels and just take a look not 50 let's say 100 pixel and it is going to be rounded
1:23:10
and now we want to remove this border from the right side so it will look nicer here
1:23:16
as you look oops 100 okay so i have got this one selected so i
1:23:22
have to unselect and then just take a look so you might not being able to see the
1:23:27
change but i'm going to make it visible to you so first of all i'm going to change the background color with this
1:23:33
one as you can see so i'm going to use pixi which we have been using from the beginning so i'm going to use pixy
1:23:41
and let's drag it here and it's going to help me get the color code so i'm going to hover over here and then i'm hitting
1:23:47
ctrl alt or copy to copy the color code and then let's go back here
1:23:52
and let's select the section from here go to style then background type is
1:23:59
going to be classic then check or actually change the color so i'm going to change the color right
1:24:04
here and just take a look we have got the background color changed and now we are going to take one header
1:24:11
this is heading then we have got a paragraph then we have got another heading then i have got another paragraph so
1:24:17
let's take this element here this widget so let's take you let me take you here in this
1:24:23

1:24:44
from here copy and i'm going to actually remove the
1:24:49
formattings by using my uh tool which i mostly use so i've removed the
1:24:54
formatting now let's copy paste it in notepad so that all the formattings will
1:25:00
be removed which actually causes some um troubles so i don't want to
1:25:06
get any trouble so that i'll be able to change i'll be able to change the colors of the text as well well
1:25:12
they will not have the have the formattings okay so i'm going to show you what i mean uh
1:25:18

1:25:30
formatting first because they caused some troubles remove the
1:25:36
formattings copy and paste them here okay so i have just copied and pasted all the
1:25:42
information here let's drag them a little more here and you're going to work on this letter okay within few
1:25:48
minutes so let me just click here and then get these um font sizes and other
1:25:56
information so i'm going to use one finder again let's click here so it is going to show me the font size
1:26:02

1:26:36
wrong widget here so i have to click again okay so everything fine here and then we
1:26:42
have got these paragraphs so i'm going to click here again let's click here so the font size is 22 pixel font weight
1:26:50
with gentium basic so let me change the formatting here style go to uh typography
1:26:57
and then genteem basic selected 22 is selected and 400 is selected as well so let's keep them as there
1:27:04
and now i'm going to change the color of this text so it will look much closer to original document so
1:27:10
let's click here and i'm going to change the color and just take a look how it is looking like
1:27:15
now let's go back again and we're going to change this um chain maillog and other information
1:27:20
here so let's click here on this font size actually font finder then just take a look font size is 24 pixel
1:27:26
and 300 is the font weight so let me just and here is the color code so i'm going to copy the
1:27:32
color code from here okay
1:27:37
and okay no problem so let's cross it out and
1:27:44
i'm going to see if this is going to work yeah it's working fine and what
1:27:51
was the font size uh it was 24 pixels 300 font weight so 24 300
1:27:58
so let's go here typography 24 and 300 is the size
1:28:05
and after that we have got the job title or rule so let's click here again and it is 22 pixel 300 and
1:28:13
gentium 22 300 gentium so let's click here
1:28:18
22 is selected gtm is selected and 300 is here so it should be also 300 i guess
1:28:24
so let me just check it again i'm sorry i'm doing this um yeah 300 the double
1:28:30
so so that's the 300 and here we have got a beautiful
1:28:36
formatting here now let's change this color as it is in black so i'm going to change
1:28:41
it to black as well all right so we have got this basic part but i might have worked here and let's go to
1:28:48
image okay so 50 or 40
1:28:55
is going to work nice 40 no 50 yeah and
1:29:02
let's just decrease yep and here we go
1:29:11
okay so we have got the proper image size i believe but if you if you spend more time you are going to be able to set it much
1:29:17
beautifully but what else we are seeing here we are seeing a shadow here so let me show you how i
1:29:23
can place a shadow like this so click here on the image and from style you are going to find this
1:29:29
box shadow so let's click on it and after that as you can see it's already selected
1:29:34
some shadow works here but if you want to do some customization you can do this vertically
1:29:40
or horizontally as you want but i'd love to keep it to zero oops no zero horizontally and
1:29:48
particularly let's do this a little bit six okay or five and i think it's looking much better so
1:29:55
i'd love to keep it as it is as of now and then what i'm going to do we have got two more testimonials so what i'm
1:30:02
going to do i'm going to simply copy this section or before i copy i'd love to remove the
1:30:09
default um paddings and margins so let's click on advanced then remove the default padding and
1:30:16
margin and then i'm going to give some margin here to let's say 25 for both top and bottom
1:30:24
and now i'm going to copy this one so copy and paste it right here and
1:30:31
i'm going to paste it again right here okay so uh now okay i have missed something
1:30:37
so i'm going to cross them out i have missed to add the background here and the padding inside
1:30:43
so let me do this first so that it will help us speed up so here as you can see the background so i'm going to click
1:30:48
uh hover over here then i'm going to get the code of the color control alt or copy and change the
1:30:55
background color of this section where we are seeing having this heading and paragraph so let me
1:31:00
click here go to style then from background click on classic then change the color
1:31:06
and paste the color and just take a look we have got a different background here now inside this um section
1:31:14
or column we need to provide some padding so i'm going back here and i'm going to click again
1:31:20
and let's say i want to give 25 pixels of padding and just take a look how it is looking like so
1:31:27
you can actually select what is the padding going best with your uh sweet so let me click again here
1:31:33
and let's see yeah everything looks good now i can copy and paste it here paste and
1:31:41
paste it again here all right so we have got a beautiful formatting here now what else i have to do i have to change
1:31:47
this image and then place this column in the left side and then the image is in the right side so let me
1:31:53
just do this we are simply dragging this one here and pasting it here all right so we have got this column in
1:32:00
the left side um the text column and the image column in the right side easy right so now what i'm going to do i'm going to
1:32:07
change the image of this lady so i'm going to actually of this boy to a lady so i'm going to click
1:32:13
on chose and here is the lady and i'm going to click on insert media and we have got a different style here
1:32:21
so we have to change the border radius into some parts so i'm going to click here go
1:32:26
to style and you are saying that in top we have got 100 pixels so we are going to make
1:32:33
it to 0 and here in this right i'm going to give 100 and just take a look we have got the
1:32:39
formatting as we need right so i am not going to change anything here
1:32:44
because i believe you already got the idea how to customize these parts
1:32:50
uh from this one this video and from the previous video so let's just move on we are going to
1:32:55
the next section which is going to be this one which is very basic as well but let me show you so let's go back again and
1:33:03
let's click on this expand icon so that actually the arrow icon so that will have this editing panel
1:33:09
now we are going to take another um structure here so i'm going to go
1:33:14
with one structure or one column structure and then i'm going to change the background i'm going to copy the background color
1:33:20
controller copy and click here on this section style classic and change the background
1:33:28
after that i have to take one heading here one paragraph and one image so let me take them
1:33:36
one heading then one paragraph and one image so we have to take this
1:33:42
inner section and we are going to widgets text editor
1:33:49
and widgets and then image and we are going to copy this text from
1:33:55
here and let's go back again here and we are going to paste this text copy and we are going to paste it
1:34:03
here all right so now let's change the color of the text to
1:34:08
white okay and then we are going to change this actually upload this image
1:34:15
so i'm going to click here and actually click here and then click on chose image and
1:34:22
upload the image i believe this one which doesn't have the background i'm not sure though so let's click on insert
1:34:28
yeah this image and then we are going to customize a little bit so not that hard
1:34:36
customization here so we actually going to remove the padding stuffs from here first so let's
1:34:42
click here go to advanced and nothing okay so it's working fine and then we can
1:34:49
give some padding inside this um text editor so let's go
1:34:54
advanced go to advanced and then we're going to give let's say from the top actually from each side we are looking
1:35:01
for a padding of 25 pixel and not from the left
1:35:08
okay and on top we could actually increase it a little more and i think it's looking much better right
1:35:15
so you can increase the image to get more beautiful alignment or decrease the image it depends
1:35:21
so i'm going to keep them as there and let's just get this um elements here 34 pixel
1:35:30
and 400 lotto so 34 400 lotto 34
1:35:38
400 and the color is white content should be centered and here we
1:35:43
go we have got this beautiful uh section as well done so let's copy
1:35:49
and paste the text here all right so now we have got a button here which we are going to
1:35:54
work on so let's go to widgets drag this button right here and
1:36:01
it should be in center aligned and after that we have got the background to yellow so i'm going to copy the code of
1:36:08
yellow and let's just what else buy it now so i'm going to make the
1:36:14
changes so first of all click here then as you can see this text we are going to change the text to
1:36:20
buy it now and then we are going to if you want you can
1:36:27
place the link right here so let's say i want to give the link of this
1:36:32
um landing page so i've just inserted and you can
1:36:40
you can just um make the adjustment by doing so so i'm going to keep it too small it's
1:36:45
looking bigger those for some reason okay so now it's time to change the background color so i'm going to copy
1:36:51
the code control ultra copy and go to style and from background color you can change the color code
1:36:58
from here and here we go we have got the background uh changed now we want a different color
1:37:05
in hover so let's go here and from text or not text color background color
1:37:12
we are going to paste the code sorry going to paste the code and let's
1:37:17
make it a little change just take a look it's slightly being changed right so now it's time to give the
1:37:24
border radius so i'm going here button okay and then border radius
1:37:29
as you can see so we are going to give like 50 and just take a look how it is going
1:37:35
to look like right so now as you can see here we have got some extra spreading
1:37:40
extra padding stuffs in right and left side so let me show you how we can do this so as you can see your padding so we are
1:37:46
going to give on right side on top let's say we want 20 pixel on bottom we want 20 pixel
1:37:53
but on right and left we want um 40 pixel or 45 or let's say 50 pixel is going to
1:38:00
look nicer here 50 and i think it's too big here so
1:38:05
15 and 15. just take a look we have got a beautiful button as well so it's a little bigger but we
1:38:13
can simply work on this and let's just go to content from here we can select to not extra
1:38:20
small medium [Music] large or we can simply select it to small and then we can decrease the
1:38:27
text size from typography and we can simply decrease the size to
1:38:34
yeah 30 and just take a look it's almost uh matching up with our design though a little here and there but i
1:38:41
believe i was able to show you the work uh which we have been here to learn okay so now the complex one of the
1:38:49
complex parts i'd say so now let me just show you we need to take another intersection here
1:38:58
and after that we are going to duplicate this one and then we are going to take
1:39:04
in a section here actually and then we are going to take an inner section
1:39:09
right here and we're going to copy this inner section copy and then we're going
1:39:14
to paste it here all right now let's delete this one
1:39:19
and then we have to duplicate few more times okay and i think four icons yeah
1:39:28
four icons so here this is a um this is an advanced task which you might
1:39:34
be facing problem with uh while you are using elementor so this is really
1:39:40
handy to learn so i'm going to click on cross and we have got the structure and now we are going to
1:39:46
okay so i have to i have to take again
1:39:51
let me click here here and an inner section
1:39:56
so it is going to help you for sure so let me copy and paste it here let's delete this one
1:40:04
we have got the same thing for this one as well and delete this one okay so now we have one image
1:40:11
text one image text and then four icons here so let's go back here we are going to
1:40:16
upload the image and then we are going to
1:40:22
widgets and let's say yeah let's say text editor which they
1:40:27
should be in text editor and then another image i can simply
1:40:32
delete this one from here okay delete and duplicate this one
1:40:40
all right so we have got the basic structure what which we need and then let's copy this text or upload
1:40:47
an image upload image which is this one this one actually so let me click on insert
1:40:53
and then copy the text and paste the text to remove all the formattings come
1:40:59

depending on your design or style so here we have got some padding inside this section so i'm going
1:56:08
to click here and i'm going to advance padding and i'm going to select it again 25
1:56:17

1:56:24
and then we have okay so maybe yeah 35 or a little more i am not
1:56:31
sure but let's keep it to 35 so you you just got the idea how it works so we can simply remove these
1:56:38
okay and then we are going to copy this one and then
1:56:44
we are going to paste it here ops not copy and we can paste it here and just
1:56:50
take a look i'm going to delete this one now it's just time to change the color of this text to red so i'm going to

1:57:32
and background hash okay so just take a look now we have got some
1:57:38
border things so we are going to work on this i'm going to click here
1:57:44
and one pixel solid and we have got a slide so i mean back here to style
1:57:52
border and solid it is going to be one pixel and let's keep the color as it
1:58:00
is okay or we can actually let's go with this color okay
1:58:05
and then i'm going to copy and paste the style here all right
1:58:11
so we have got the borders now we need some margin in between these um
1:58:19
columns so let's go back here let's click here and we are going to not right here we
1:58:26
are going to give margin here so go to advanced and click here
1:58:31
and margin right we need to give let's say 15 and this one
1:58:39
advance margin left we are going to give 15 and just
1:58:44
take a look we have got the basic structure as we wanted right so now we can
1:58:51
actually we are going to work on these stuffs so it will look much closer so i'm going
1:58:58
to click here and then am going to oh okay just let's just keep it i was actually about to
1:59:04
work on these uh padding stuffs here so i'd say let's say 45 and
1:59:12
from left side i want 45 and it is going to look nicer i think i don't know but let's click
1:59:20
here and then 45 on a 35 should be everywhere
1:59:28
but here let's say 45 and 45 okay so it's looking much closer
1:59:36
to our example one now as you can see here is one part so we have to
1:59:41
upload this image and then um we're going to work on this so let's
1:59:46
just increase let's click here and we're going to give some margin here in the bottom so let's unselect
1:59:54
this one increase the margin of not margin it should be padding so let's click here and we are going to
2:00:01
give margin top to let's say 50
2:00:07
50 and margin bottom to 350 let's see how it is looking yeah 350
2:00:14
or 450 whatever we are going to match it up soon so now we are going to take another
2:00:19
take another section but before that let me drag this image
2:00:28
okay drag this image right here and we're going to upload the image
2:00:34
which is this one and we are going to place this image we are
2:00:39
going to make it in position so let's go to advanced and positioning position is going to be
2:00:47
obsolete and here it is so let's just
2:00:53
see we are going to take it to 0 to keep it in middle all right and from
2:01:00
offset we are going to move it all right
2:01:07
or we can simply drag and drop it here
2:01:12
all right so i think it's going to fit well and then we're going to take the next
2:01:18
section which is going to be a one header so we are going to take another section by oops
2:01:25
clicking on this plus icon section and let's take okay so first of all let me
2:01:32
give some padding for this section so on top we are going to give
2:01:38
like 350 and let's start from there so let's go for
2:01:44
it and i think it's looking good here
2:01:51
well fitted what do you think let me know in the commenting below by commenting below okay
2:01:57
so let's click here and let's take the heading here and let's copy these
2:02:04
text paste them here and then we have got this same thing so i am going to
2:02:10
copy and paste them copy this section and
2:02:17
paste them right here okay and actually
2:02:27
i have to work on this here so i'm sorry about the sound and let's go back here
2:02:34
uh advantage i made some mistake i guess nope okay so let's
2:02:41
change the background color first control letter copy so it will help me get a little organized
2:02:48
um find navigator alright so let's go to style and
2:02:55
change the background color to white and now it will it is much easier for me
2:03:02
to for me to navigate and work so yeah so now let's just
2:03:09
change the color of this text to yellow so i'm going to copy the yellow color
2:03:15
code and style color
2:03:20
and here we go and then we have this typography
2:03:27
we are going to take from here 44 pixels and 600 okay so 44 pixel
2:03:38
44 pixel i'm going to go with 400 i am not going to make this text bold because i already have shown how to
2:03:45
make this one bulk i simply have to uh select with the spawn and then the class is big and then it
2:03:52
will make the change right so i don't have to spend the time i believe so let's move on we are all actually
2:03:58
let's do this let's do this we are doing it this for everything so why should i miss so i'm going to select
2:04:06
here um class sorry sorry sorry spam tag spun
2:04:14
and here close the spawn tag
2:04:19
and take the class equal to double quotation and then big just take
2:04:26
a look it's been changed and now we have to copy and paste this part but before that let me take
2:04:33
two sections inner sections okay and then i'm going
2:04:38
to copy this inner section paste it here
2:04:45
delete and we can simply duplicate this one right after we made the adjustment and the modification
2:04:52
so here as you can see we don't need this header and we have got this in yellow so let me
2:04:59
take the yellow color code again ctrl alt copy and click
2:05:06
here go here oops go to style and then from icon change the color to
2:05:13
yellow and just take a look we have got the yellow color here but i'm not actually going to work on this text formatting
2:05:19
right so we have got things done here let me just remove the padding and margin stuffs
2:05:27
and then we are going to simply duplicate this one and delete this one all right so just
2:05:34
take a look how it is going to look like right so easily we have just covered and
2:05:40
we actually have to give some padding in the top of this so i'm going to give
2:05:45
some oh no um actually
2:05:51
let me give it to zero but this one i'm going to give some pairing
2:05:57
of bottom pinning bottom let's say
2:06:04
uh 30 okay so 30 is going to work fine and looking good here now we have
2:06:11
um quote some extra extra spelling right after this section so i'm going to click here actually
2:06:19
again go to navigator and it's the section is selected the whole section go to
2:06:24
advanced and from padding we want to give the padding of
2:06:30
let's see 100 pixel
2:06:35
or we can increase it to 200 200 is too much 150
2:06:44
and here we go we have got this beautiful setup here all right so and if you need you can actually do
2:06:49
the placement very easily so let's say i want to get only 320 from the top it is going to
2:06:55
look much nicer and here i want 120 it is going to look much nicer
2:07:00
all right so now let's go for this section and we are going to copy and paste this part from the other part

click here again go to content and from typography 22 pixels
2:12:48
400 all right and so just take a look we are getting it
2:12:54
almost done so now we want to give the background so the content
2:12:59
background is going to be this color so i'm going to copy the color code
2:13:05
and the background color is going to be like this yeah why it's not changing
2:13:12
okay so content and then title the background color is going to be little darker so let me
2:13:19
copy and paste it here and just take a look
2:13:25
we have got everything working perfectly here and then what we are going to do
2:13:31
okay so i have made a mistake i have to click on duplicate nope
2:13:37
sorry i have to go here
2:13:44
okay so i've got them so let's click on delete and here i actually have to take one
2:13:50
inner section otherwise we are going to face some trouble and in this inner section i am going to
2:13:56
copy and paste thing here all right so everything looks good now
2:14:03
now let's delete this one and we are going to have three sections or three toggles here so i'm
2:14:10
going to um duplicate them by clicking here delete duplicate
2:14:19
and duplicate duplicate duplicate okay
2:14:25
so we have got six um toggle bars so i'm going to show you how they are going to work
2:14:33
all right so now if i click on update i didn't update it one single time so it
2:14:38
was a big risk here if i was having any issues i should have lost everything so this is
2:14:45
our landing page so far as you can see a
2:14:50
long long landing page i have never ever seen this long landing pages before but this
2:14:56
one is too long which i worked for my client and i chose to make this video so here i am seeing
2:15:03
some troubles or issues as you can see the original one has
2:15:09
a nice formatting so i'm going to remove the padding stuffs from here okay so it is
2:15:15
going to look nice now all right so let's click on update and we can have more
2:15:21
some more padding let's say 50 it is going to look much better now
2:15:28
let's go for the next section which is going to be the paragraph so it is the very basic thing so i'm
2:15:36
actually going to drag in paragraph widget from here
2:15:41
and paste it here is it no okay so i'm actually going to click here
2:15:47
here we have got a divider so i'm going to take a divider divider here right here all right
2:15:54
and then you can select the double dotted so this one is dotted so i've got the dotted one
2:16:00
and i'd love to keep it as it is and then we have got the paragraph so i'm going
2:16:08
to take the text editor right here and now let's copy everything from here
2:16:17
copy and paste everything here all right and then i have got this text
2:16:23
with this color so let me just show you um
2:16:28
so text editor the
2:16:34
alignment should be centered we are going to copy these texts paste and go to text editor and paste
2:16:41
them here then we need them in this color
2:16:47
so let's copy the color go back here select them all
2:16:52
it has an underline so i'm going to click on underline go to style chose color paste it and
2:17:00
just take it we have got this one as well so now we are done with this part now what we
2:17:06
have to do we have to click on this section we want to remove some padding from the
2:17:11
bottom so let's click here and let's give on top we are going to give 50
2:17:18
pixels of padding and on bottom yeah on bottom we don't need to provide any padding as it is not
2:17:25
here so let's take this footer section and we are going to be done so let's click
2:17:32
here and we need two columns right here and one is going both of them are going to
2:17:38
be actually paragraphs so i'm going to click here as then there are no um what to say no
2:17:46
menus in our uh works so we're going to use this paragraph so i'm actually going
2:17:52
to copy and let's duplicate this one and delete
2:17:57
this one and then we can simply change the text
2:18:03
to disclaimer claim here and
2:18:12
let's remove the paddings all right and we are going to layout
2:18:20
column gap no gap and um vertical alignment is going to be
2:18:27
middle and then we are going to give the copyright disclaimer so let's change the
2:18:32
background color of disclaimer as well so i'm going to click here to copy the code
2:18:37
let's come here and then we are going to
2:18:43
give the border go to style change the color here okay so it should
2:18:48
be a link actually a menu list but for now we don't have a menu
2:18:55
so we can keep it as it is so for some reason the color didn't changed
2:19:01
copy come back here content select style
2:19:11
ah okay so i have got some issues so i am going to
2:19:16
take text editor again and let's put d i s c l a i m e r let's
2:19:24
underline give the underline and go to style change the color paste the code and now
2:19:31
it's working fine and now we are going to take it to the right corner so we are done but we are going
2:19:39
to give some padding inside these um boxes so let's say
2:19:46
padding is going to be top 15 and nothing else for this one as well
2:19:54
we're going to give the padding top 15 and
2:20:00
now let's see this is the color of the background so i'm going to copy the background color
2:20:07
and paste the background color right here go to style
2:20:12
background change color and paste it oops add hash and here we go all right guys so
2:20:20
now let's update this document
2:20:25
and let me cross it out view this in a new tab
2:20:31

1:58
so with that I will hand things over to my list leader Ali schoni and she will get us going awesome well thanks Alexis
2:05
and man we have 60 minutes we'll now about 56 minutes together and we we're
2:11
I'm just excited to jump in and we have probably a full day of content and it's going to go fast and furious so if again
2:16
you do have a landing page you'd like to have reviewed U feel free to drop that in the Q&A and we'll make sure and pull that up here so let's talk about landing
2:23
pages one of the first things that I want to do as we talk about landing pages is really set the stage for what are the characteristics of a good
2:29
Landing p page so if um like on our team we have a QA DOC for how we run webinars and and we do this every month you most
2:36
likely want to have a QA DOC for how you do landing pages too so sometimes let me tell you what happens is marketers or
2:42
marketing team members design great landing pages they get sent to our client they get sent to our boss and all of a sudden landing page that was really
2:48
simple became this giany of content and mess and then it doesn't convert so let's make sure that we all agree on
2:54
what makes for a good landing page so first of all it has one call to action now you can have multiple buttons but
2:59
you typically want one called to action on the page so think about this as a a page that's designed to do one thing it
3:05
has one action only and again we want people to end up at that um at that ends there's additional doors or pathways on
3:12
the site um they're typically Stripped Away now this isn't true of all Sites today um a lot of landing pages may
3:18
still have some pieces of navigation but the less option for someone to essentially take a back door or a side
3:24
door out and do something else you want to strip that away so typically you're going to say landing pages stripping away navigation stripping away footer
3:31
just keeping that 100% focused now again we'll talk about some implications of where you might want to do that and not
3:37
do that but that's typically going to be accepted uh contents written and structured for one goal typically one
3:42
audience so right now we have a client we're working on a landing page campaign with and they have a new offering and it
3:48
actually appeals to three different audiences we're going to have three different landing pages why because each one of those audiences has their own
3:55
very specific pain point and because of that that's what's going to be teased out in the headlin
4:00
and when we don't really get specific on our landing pages that's when our copy ends up being kind of me and just
4:05
vanilla and it doesn't really connect and so that's where you're going to see conversion uh struggle uh it's typically
4:11
going to answer the five W's so if you have any background in journalism same sort of thing applies today people are
4:16
wanting to know who are you what is this why should I do it who else is doing it um you know what are the the details
4:22
like how long again all of that depends on what type of page it is but you have to give enough so that they know what's
4:29
behind the the form or the submission without giving away the farm as we say and then it's typically optimized for
4:35
marketing campaigns not necessarily SEO so again if for those of you that are they're really great on SEO you know the
4:41
purpose of SEO sometimes you're going to have Pages where the page might just be called um you know newsletter sign up
4:47
there's really no way to quote unquote optimize it for search you're optimizing it so that when someone comes from
4:52
whatever the place they're coming from email it might be um they're they're coming from a referral site when they
4:58
get to that page it's optimized for them to convert in that specific path So Paid
5:03
ads is a slightly different story we will talk about the number one thing that makes paid ads convert more effectively toward the end of the
5:09
webinar um and that's actually true of all different landing pages but this one specific secret we'll cover at the end
5:14
is going to dive more into this uh in detail so what are marketing uh professionals and sales teams using
5:20
landing pages for well we're going to Le on HubSpot for this specific uh data they did a study or at a survey last
5:27
year and they were talking about again what are the most common use cases and how do people use uh landing pages so
5:33
we've got essentially six here with other being one of them so we've got four customers or direct purchases so
5:39
this is most likely because a lot of HubSpot customers again if you don't use HubSpot and you're on this webinar that's okay like we're going to talk
5:44
about things that are not specific job spot but a lot of people uh in the B2B Community have some sort of a purchase a
5:50
product they have a software they have a trial they have something so that's what this 33% is for this 43% is probably for
5:57
the reasons why a lot of you are here today and that is we want leads we want contact information we want signups we
6:03
want downloads We want webinar registrations this 43% is where we're going to spend most of our time talking
6:08
about this but all of the things that we're talking about here today have a little intricacies depending on what type of landing page you're using um
6:15
premiums product signups again this is going to be the same sort of like we're getting people to get a free trial or a
6:20
test of something this email subscribers this is a big one for us because we drive a lot of our traffic first to an
6:26
email list as do a lot of companies and then from there we drive all lot more activity at a at a a more further stage
6:32
in the funnel and then memberships or pay cons subscriptions so this is again if you happen to buy access to something
6:38
online that you know like Netflix or or let's say you're going to have a membership to a like a Professional
6:44
Services Community that's where that falls in so that's how people are using landing pages now this is I posted this
6:49
in LinkedIn yesterday and before we dive in um this is yes I drew this this is my chicken scratch but the reason I want to
6:55
pull this up is um when people think about landing pages they typically want to know exactly like what is the layout
7:00
that I should follow and there is no one layout you should follow but there are common elements and I just wanted to
7:06
walk through this with you here before we dive into exactly the different types of landing pages so at a glance if I'm
7:12
looking at this landing page right now what you can see is the pattern of your eye going left to right left to right
7:17
left to right the reason for this is that's how we read that tends to be how we go down a page and that's pretty
7:23
fundamental to web copy now the reason I I bring this up and and kind of harp on that specifically is the first first
7:29
place your eye goes here is typically to this title and the eye-catching or matter effect title is very very
7:35
important and this is one of the first places I see a lot of challenges because the title might be something like so
7:40
let's say for example instead of this webinar today that was about capturing and converting B2B leads if we just
7:45
called uh this webinar like let's say landing page 101 okay that might be
7:50
important that might be effective but we probably won't get nearly as many folks that are going to want to come and learn about 101 they might be like yeah I got
7:57
that or if the if the headline said something that was completely off what we said in our email it might not
8:04
convert as as much the title again if you're trying to be everything to everyone you're going to struggle but
8:09
the title is just the first place think about it like the key to get people to go to the other things now the reason
8:15
why there's a form on this part side of the page is typically High performing pages that have some sort of very direct
8:21
value have a form on the page or it's very clear what the next step is so in
8:26
just a couple of the landing pages that folks had sent in um prior to this webinar I took a look and I'll tell you
8:32
guys that one of the biggest things that I'm noticing is like the form is buried or the call to actions buried or it's
8:38
not clear what's next and on one of the pages that I looked at the form was on the right hand side but I just had an
8:44
email so think about this from the perspective of wherever you came from and it's like we all know every single
8:51
day we as consumers know when we're going to be someone's lead let's make sure that when we get to the point where we are someone's lead it is very very
8:57
clear what they need from us why why would we would qualify because we're still only going to get a small percentage of the people that get to
9:03
this page it's the right ones we want the right people so we'll talk about for structure and then kind of how to do
9:08
that as we go throughout this webinar but that is that is key um and then we've got some again I talked about navigation kind of removing this you do
9:15
want this visual branding it needs to be congruent with your site if your site is you know black and red and gold and
9:20
suddenly your landing pages are purple and green that all of a sudden creates distrust again we see this all the time
9:26
but that's just these are kind of like one-on-one types of things key benefits this has to be like what's in it for the
9:32
customer or what's in it for the lead U on the back side social proof usually is who is it that looks like me talks like
9:39
me sounds like me that has had success with whatever it is that I'm doing um great you know great ebook not
9:46
necessarily a good piece of content if it says man I spent three hours trying to figure this out myself and I watched
9:52
this video series from Alexis and I learned it in five minutes that is social proof that goes on a landing page
9:58
because that tells me okay if I give you my information it's worth it for me to save three hours right so that's the
10:03
kind of social proof we're talking about here uh down below it depends on how much further and how much nurturing you
10:09
need to do on the page to get someone to take action again of the pages that I looked at what I often saw was again
10:15
like title benefits copy copy copy copy lots of stuff button or copy copy copy
10:22
on the left- hand side and then a form that kind of followed you but it was just kind of like stuff there wasn't really any like reason or rhyme at as to
10:29
how that stuff fit together so typically you want to think about in the person's mind on that landing page what did they
10:35
want to achieve based on where they came from what is the process that they go to to validate that information and then
10:41
what else do they need to know before they might submit so this is what this section is and typically this is where
10:46
your who what why when you know how if it's an event what time does it start who else is going to be there who are
10:51
the speakers is there limited registration what's the travel like there's a lot of times even when I'm going to an event if you don't tell me
10:58
if the parking is paid or not I won't convert right away because I got to figure that out like I will convert
11:03
eventually but I might bounce off the page five times because I got to go search that information so think about
11:09
all those things because so much of landing page strategy is is is just that it's it's the little facts and so much
11:16
of the conversion opportunity comes from the strategy not from the little like should I make this button red or green
11:21
if you're on this call because you think I'm going to tell you that like yes your landing page will convert better if you do green instead of red you're in the
11:27
wrong place cuz most of us don't have as much traffic to actually test that that's purely fore e-commerce High
11:33
trffic software most of us on this call are not going to have that type of experience so we're going to bring this back up toward the end of the the
11:39
webinar here as we talk through like some actual use cases and I'll show you a couple things I'm talking about so
11:45
before we dive in I am going to pull up this landing page that was sent in um from uh one of our attendees and just
11:51
let's see if I can pull it up here and we're going to use this as a as a way to just kind of talk through what I just
11:57
showed okay so this is the leing page that we sent in U for us to just talk about and
12:02
this company um I I don't know very much about them but we're going to go ahead and just kind of discuss it here
12:07
together and from what I can tell on the left hand side it's a leadership company this is what you know they probably help
12:13
teams uh it looks like Elevate the pace performance and culture of your company's greatest asset so the the key
12:19
thing to think about when you get to a landing page is like right now I might not be in the best position to analyze the content on the page because I don't
12:25
know the path that someone took to get here so what I when I'm talking about what's on this page I'm ask just going
12:30
to share like best practices so one of the first things that I would say um is an opportunity is if you do have a a
12:37
chatbot that pops up having the chatbot special program this is actually a HubSpot chatbot because I can tell the
12:43
way it's styled having that chatbot pop up in the in the lower right hand side with an actual specific question
12:48
relative to this landing pages key I'm going to show you an example at the end of this webinar of a of the way that a
12:54
company does this and it makes so much sense but if I was looking like do you have questions I'm happy to have
12:59
a better way to use this might be um you know what questions can I answer about
13:04
this program or what you know something along those lines again since they don't know what this program is they probably can't give it to you exactly the other
13:11
key thing that's missing is like in this particular page layout I'm missing an action above the fold I'm missing any
13:16
sort of like there's no button there isn't a form I have to scroll to go figure out like what's happening and
13:22
it's not 100% clear exactly what is being sold so the other thing about keeping the navigation here on top like
13:28
this all looks really clean I don't see a key like there isn't a bottom of funnel action so if I did even get
13:35
referred to this company and ended up on this landing page I might end up going you know what I'm not entirely sure what
13:40
to do here so then again we do what we typically would do either bounce or scroll so in this Cas I'm going to scroll and so you know are you ready to
13:47
take the lead give your first-time managers life-changing professional development okay so I keep going but
13:52
there something so I'm not sure if it's loading um and there's text here there's
13:58
just as I'm going there's a lot there's a lot to read and the reason I'm bringing that up is not because like I
14:04
can't read it typically is something where like if we have to read and figure out everything from text it's going to
14:10
slow us down so best practices of landing page if there was something here if again if it's not showing up if there
14:16
was something here that was like a diagram that quickly showed me like okay give the first time managers
14:21
life-changing professional development if we're talking about creating landing pages that more effectively tease out
14:27
the pain the thing I would tell you here as a person who owns a company as has been a first-time manager and now has
14:33
people managing people what are some of the challenges that first- time managers experience and why might this program be
14:39
a better fit for them so this has everything to do with the positioning and the copy and less to do with like
14:44
the structure of the page but even now I'm being asked to register now but I don't have things like how much is it
14:50
when is it how long who else is in it is it for men is it women like all these
14:55
questions are going to stop me in my tracks and if those are the questions I should continue to go down here what
15:00
does it mean firsttime managers does it mean like if I've been working 50 years and I suddenly managed someone at the
15:06
end of my career that like I can be in this program so all those questions are the things that are in the back of
15:11
someone's mind and that's often what what challenges us when it comes to landing page conversion so I'm going to
15:17
jump back to some examples at the end of the webinar but I wanted to just kind of talk through this because the first things that I see on this page that that
15:23
would probably help first would be creating a call to action that would be above the fold I would simplify this
15:29
100% so first time managers figure out what it is the pain is like you know
15:34
level up your first-time managers in three months or in 90 days give me a time based thing and an outcome that as
15:40
a owner I can actually put myself into this and go you know what this is great it sounds like Alexus has really benefit
15:46
from this program let's now see when it is how much it costs and how I move along okay so that's just one example um
15:53
again if you want some feedback on any other pages that that you're building feel free to send them over even after this webinar i' be happy to to send some
15:59
feedback let's go ahead and and jump back in all right so Alexis can you nope you probably can't see what I'm doing no
16:05
not yet let's try this again right now I'm just gonna talk to myself all right
16:10
cool okay so let's dig into this current slide all right so we're back here yes
16:16
okay fantastic all right so let's talk about the five types of landing pages now real quick what I want to pull out is what I just covered would actually be
16:24
what I would consider to be a product page so a landing page is usually much more
16:29
um again I would I would simplify it even uh down further but I did get a
16:34
couple questions prior to the webinar of like what's the difference between a landing page and a product page and if
16:40
that happens to be something you're thinking about here let's tackle that at the end in the Q&A but a landing page is
16:45
is usually not the same as like you're selling a product or a service because there's usually many many many more
16:51
questions that that revolve around that if I was going back to that leadership example and I wanted to create a landing
16:57
page as a teaser for that lead ship program I might actually suggest creating a piece of content called the
17:03
firsttime manager guide to managing people and I would create a short thing and allow them to download that and that
17:09
would be the leadin that I would use to get them to that product page which again would actually sell the program for me so it might just be that we're
17:15
sending someone to a page about a product or service before they're actually ready to buy and we need
17:21
something in the middle that actually helps them raise their hand and then answer some of those initial questions so let's dive into the five types of
17:27
landing pages so the first one is going to be a purchase this is what we experience this
17:33
might be you know if you happen to go check out a software page if you happen to buy let's say we did buy some of
17:38
these you know coaching programs or something like that online a purchase page we're not going to talk about purchasing a lot of this is Ecommerce so
17:45
we're just not going to dig into that today bottom of funnel I would say the the for folks that said I here's what I
17:50
want to learn on the webinar a lot of people want more contact us submissions or more bottom of funnel sales
17:56
submissions okay join the club guys me too so the key thing is in order for us to
18:01
get more bottom of funnel sales submissions we have to do a good job of finding the people that are at the right
18:07
stage to get them to the bottom of funnel but I will tell you there are some things we can do to actually drive more here so we're going to dig into
18:13
that event registration you're on a webinar that's an event registration page that you probably went through
18:18
we'll talk also about event registration in person but that's a key one a top of funnel content this would be you know
18:24
ebooks guides white papers um toolkits anything you're using at that top of the
18:30
funnel in terms of like product or excuse me problem aware but they might not be aware of your company so you may
18:36
have found us because you may have found our 10 things you should do before you buy HubSpot content you may have
18:42
downloaded it ended up on our email list and then here you're at this webinar so that might have been an example and then
18:47
a support or service landing page and that might be um for some software companies you can't find these because
18:53
they don't want you to contact their support they want you to use their chatbot which uh we're not fans of that
18:59
but uh if you have a service like ticket or a submission typically there's going to be some best practices there so let's
19:05
go ahead and dive into to the landing page and and things to think about so with purchase landing pages this is
19:10
mostly B2B use case is going to be software in this think about this like I call the I call these landing pages
19:17
credit card waivers that just want to complete their purchase and so this is something that um strategy wise if you
19:25
have a product that people want to buy right now and they're ready and they're referred and they have have to go through a whole process it's just
19:31
frustrating um that's we live in a world where we get referred something and then
19:36
we go into a rabbit hole and we can go from never knowing something to buying it in 24 hours like we've seen that
19:42
happen today so they need to be able to buy now there needs to be less friction high amount of trust there needs to be
19:48
like is my credit card information safe um you know if you go to a page that redirects and it doesn't look like the
19:55
previous page the colors change the button size changes all that says oh my God someone just stole my information so
20:01
you have all of this is about trust credibility and professionalism like this is the key and then what happens
20:08
next so just like we do on Amazon like the minute we get a purchase on Amazon
20:14
it's yes your credit card gets dinged here's when it's coming and then PS We Know everywhere our packages at any
20:19
given time so because Amazon set that as the Precedence that has to be the way that we approach this here so bottom of
20:25
the funnel bottom of the funnel examples are going to be book of consult they're going to be things like booking a demo
20:31
um getting a free audit a lot of times people will say let's talk or schedule a call these are these are all fine these
20:37
are all very appropriate these are all most likely driven by either like larger high ticket software Investments or
20:43
product Investments or Services these are probably the most basic and standard
20:49
things that I would suggest here however nearly every company that I go to when
20:54
they say we don't get enough contact us submissions I go to their contact page and I'm like
20:59
okay let me back up they don't have a book a call Page they just have a contact page so first of all if you are
21:05
that company you need to distinguish between like people that might need to contact you and people that want to talk to sales or talk to the consultative
21:12
sales team so you might just need a schedule a call page if you do have a schedule a call Page and you're not
21:18
getting enough submissions there there's a couple things most likely on the page you need to work on one what do I
21:24
actually get in this consultation is it a consultation or are you just pitching stuff at me right nobody wants to
21:30
schedule a call like that how long is it we don't like getting on a call when we think it's 30 minutes and then it's hour
21:36
we think it's 10 minutes and then it's 30 like tell me how long it is tell me what I get at this point when they've
21:42
booked through your link it's most likely that they've looked through a lot of your site or they've been referred to
21:48
you and so they went straight to the form so when we're referred typically we don't do a whole lot of research because
21:54
we just trust the person that told us to go contact the company or look at the products but if they've come in through some other way like let's say this
21:59
webinar or YouTube or LinkedIn they probably paged through a little bit of your content and then went to your form
22:06
so think about like what are the other places someone might go first before they want to book a call and again that
22:12
path to make sure that they know they can book a call as clear and then how soon can they book so I was talking to
22:18
friends of mine over at duct tape marketing and they were saying that um they realized when someone was booked out farther than five to seven days
22:24
their show up rate typically declined and so if that's the case like if you don't have enough availability in your
22:30
booking um also if you're not using an online calendar booking after they submit their form and it's like you've
22:36
submitted your form now wait for someone to contact you again we're back in a world where it's so when we want our
22:42
problems solved we want them solved now regardless of how it works I know sometimes it doesn't work that way but
22:47
they just want to know like how soon can I get on your calendar because now that I'm ready to talk to you I want to talk to you and those emotions are running
22:53
high so how soon can they book and then I'm still flabbergasted at the number of times that I'll sit submit in a contact
22:59
form and I will never get an email I will never get a confirmation the page doesn't even say anything and so you're
23:05
like push push push push and what happens we've seen this in client's portals when we take them over someone submitted a form seven times because
23:11
they didn't think it went through and now you've got data issues inside of your HubSpot like it just leads to a
23:17
whole slew of things so like always confirmation email always follow up and then always make sure that they know how
23:22
soon you're going to follow up with them all right so let's dig into event registration these are the who what we
23:28
when watch event registration yes you have to have this but the thing that will make event
23:33
registration landing pages if effective or going to be scarcity and urgency so if you think about this I'm going to
23:40
give you my secret to webinar registration and it's called sending an email the day before that says this is happening tomorrow everybody the amount
23:47
of registrations that we' found that just happen whether it's our webinar another company's webinar those last
23:53
minute like did you know fomo it works because we all sometimes struggle to plan ahe but we know oh you know what I
23:59
am free tomorrow at noon or I did want to go to that um people want to know is it in person if it is in person what's
24:06
the hotel what's the location what's the travel even little things like um not
24:12
sure if you can you know are you coming from out of state and want to know what it's like you know in let's say Austin
24:18
Texas before you actually register here like check out the weather this might be a little overboard but people do have
24:24
all these questions in their mind before they register so think about that and create the best experience on that landing page um for virtual how long is
24:31
it what are the key takeaways who is it for so you'll notice that like on our webinar registration Pages we have these
24:37
are the key takeaways this is the most appropriate audience to come to this webinar and here's what to expect so
24:43
again if we design our content so that we deliver on expectations we create trust and that's hopefully what you
24:48
should do don't name something as a title just to get people to register and then post registration follow-up is
24:54
critical so the biggest thing that we've noticed over the years is people will do events but then they'll get like they
24:59
just assume everybody is type A and puts it on their calendar and knows exactly what's happening every day and even if I am type A P.S that's probably me um I
25:07
have kids in a business and like other commitments and you know sometimes we just we need a reminder so event
25:13
reminders whether that's text message or if that's emails or it happens to be a fun way to announce up to the event like
25:20
hey you've registered we're actually get it give away X things at this event so we can't wait to see you there give them
25:26
a reason to show up otherwise we live live in a c a culture where it's like you know what I can't go I'm just going to cancel no big deal so keep them
25:33
hooked and engaged otherwise all the work we did to get them to that landing page and convert can actually go away
25:39
all right couple quick um Q&A I just want to stick this in there since we're not doing a whole lot about um event landing pages I did have this come in uh
25:46
as as a request last night so I wanted to throw this into the deck here so we had someone ask us you know we've had issues in the past where clients are
25:52
tentative and they don't end up ring until the last minute so how you know how do you combat that basically
25:58
question is how do you better design a landing page to help us you know group clients that are tenative or budget
26:03
approval confirmed a lot of this has to do with the psychology and the strategy around your event promotion so I think
26:09
it's probably less about your landing page and more about the strategy of how to get people engaged and retain them so
26:15
there's all types of things around here like maybe you have an exclusive part of the event that they only get access to
26:20
if they sign up in advance and if they give up their seat they can't get it back or if there's something on the line
26:26
like um you know these clients get uh a special uh a book or something like that
26:31
so usually having some sort of something on the hook would give them signed up in advance if there are limited seats there
26:37
needs to be constant countdowns and reminders of limited seats and I know again that some people are like you know
26:43
Ally that sounds a little smarmy I don't know if I like that tell you what like sometimes we think things sound smarmy
26:49
but like as humans we just we're kind of programmed to react when things like that happen like I know Alexis is a big
26:54
Taylor Swift fan so if she said if someone said like we've got Limited Edition Taylor Swift whatever at this
27:00
event like she's like I'm there and then if she doesn't show up like the email says Hey five minutes from from event
27:06
time if you don't show up or giving your sweatshirt to somebody else and she's like okay I'm there I'm there right so you just have to think about the
27:12
psychology of your event pages and I would say like something that might combat this is you may actually have a
27:19
registration where it says you know I would like to attend but I'm not sure and then for people that are on that
27:25
list you have a very specific campaign that you go back to them and say tell you what we've had 50 people say that
27:31
they're not short and we only have 20 spots so if you want this spot you need to respond by Friday at 5m again that
27:37
exclusivity because we as humans especially today want to keep our options open but then we end up shooting
27:44
ourselves in the foot and not actually getting to take part because we're we're part of too many options being open as
27:49
marketers we have to help them kind of narrow their focus all right so top of the funnel let's move into this type
27:55
these are typically ebooks guides white papers these would be what I would classify as typical lead generation if
28:01
you're looking to increase increase the conversion of your landing pages I would say this is this is probably the biggest
28:07
area that you have as a company to grow because you you can produce more
28:12
resources and especially if you use HubSpot on your landing pages every time
28:17
you use a form you can create it so that you can ask different questions so if someone actually at if someone downloads
28:24
six pieces of your content and you're using what's called Progressive forums that can actually ask them a different
28:29
question every time and you can learn more about your potential clients and customers as you do that but the
28:34
question here would be onate or gate the content clearly you can't gate you can't track leads from a landing page that
28:40
doesn't have a gate on it but we'll talk more about what that means as we move through here now what's hot like Ally
28:45
what's working on landing pages for people to create and actually download for leads
28:50
three things here proprietary research or insights that we'll call it the do the dirty work for me which is like I
28:57
read a 100 articles about Ai and I summarize them for you here that's the do do the Dirty Work like it's almost
29:04
like instead of sharing the content with people these days it's like oh my God I have so much content can you just read
29:09
it all for me and tell me what I need to know that sort of leg gen thing advisory
29:15
uh step is is working and then a tool kit so anything you can quickly load into like a Google spreadsheet anything
29:21
you can load into a tool like notion or a SAA or even like a HubSpot template those things are going to be good
29:27
toolkits to generate leads top of funnel Landing P just need to tell me what will you get tell me exactly what I will get
29:33
when I submit this form it needs to match my expectations will you spam me immediately after okay I have yet to get
29:41
to a page where someone says submit this page and I'll email you every day now until you tell me to go away if they did
29:46
no one would submit that page we just believe in setting up the experience on the front end so you don't end up with
29:52
this happening so but people do think this and then this is typically a way so again I don't think anybody Wes up in
29:58
the morning and says I hope I join an email list today I don't think we think like that I do think we wake up and go I
30:03
have problems I need to solve I'm going to go find some resources to help me and if I trust you with this great resource
30:09
what more might you have to offer me on your email list that's why you get on an email list so this is a great way to
30:14
grow your email list is to give them resources and then typically folks who come in as leads through these landing
30:20
pages will need nurturing so keep that in mind now we're just going to blow through these support and service Pages
30:26
these are going to be things like support ticket the biggest thing on these landing pages is what what should I expect when I submit a ticket how long
30:33
will it be until you get back to me is there any helpful content that I can use in the meantime while I'm waiting to hear back from you guys and then this
30:40
might be a way to do upsells and cross sales like okay the support ticket you submitted about X is actually for a
30:45
feature that you know we can help you with but it'd be easier if you had this so if you buy this you know you might
30:51
not have this issue again that's more of a software use case so that's going to
30:56
be your five types of Pages now what people will always ask they ask Alexis
31:01
this they ask me will Tyler what is a good majure of success on a landing page
31:07
what should I actually be looking at what metrics should I track so as a general rule of thumb the types of
31:13
things you should track on your landing page are page views how many people are actually getting to the page form
31:18
submissions would also be what we call conversions so the the general rule is a
31:23
landing page has one specific call to action and when you submit that three form that is your submission or your
31:30
conversion so you might depending on if you use HubSpot or if you use a different landing page software or
31:36
WordPress or something like how you call that might might vary but we call F submissions and then what that results
31:42
in is your conversion percentage of the page and then how you look at this in your landing page software may vary so
31:47
I'll show you what this looks like uh here in HubSpot but so those those four things or those three things are going
31:52
to be uh key so let's do some landing page math this is the equation again
31:57
most of your software platforms will do this for you but it is very very careful to you need to know what you're looking
32:04
at so landing page math is conversions come from or conversion rate percentage is conversions or form submissions
32:10
divided by the total visitors times 100 so you can get your percentage and that that's how that shakes out so if we had
32:16
25 form submissions on a page 100 views of that page we would have a 25%
32:21
conversion rate now the question that follows this usually is like well what's a good conversion rate okay that's
32:27
almost that's a it's universally difficult thing to answer because it it depends on
32:32
type of page or variation of page however I will get to it in a minute so let's talk about metrics inside a
32:38
HubSpot first because I want to make sure we're clear so this is what we're after we're after like 25% conversion
32:43
right now if you go into HubSpot and you go into your landing page this is what this is going to look like so if you go
32:49
to landing page and then um like view the page itself and then scroll down half the page there's this area called
32:54
performance View and here we've got total number of page views we've got 186 submissions so if anybody's following
33:01
along how would we would anybody like to do math on the Fly we're looking at submissions page views right and so does
33:08
anybody see a conversion metric on this dashboard here we do not right so if
33:13
your if your team says hey Ally or I I need to go to this leadership meeting they're asking me what our conversion
33:19
rate is on a page um okay PS if they're asking you that they probably read a Blog somewhere they don't really know
33:25
what you're measuring but let's let's humor them for a second you'd have to self- calculate this here because of the
33:30
way that this views however there is a view and HubSpot that we can get that but I'm just I'm sharing this as a if
33:36
you go into Hub SWOT looking for it this is the way it's currently displayed now there are some other metrics here that
33:41
you should keep in mind as a marketer when you're looking at landing page performance and that is exits per page
33:46
view so this would be like they've came to this page and they only did something on this page and then they bounced offu
33:52
for us this page we're looking at is actually a webinar registration page when they register it actually refreshes
33:58
right on the page and there really isn't anything else for them to do so if we wanted to improve our process we could
34:04
redirect to a new than you page that has a next step in the process for them to further nurture on this topic we've
34:11
chosen to prioritize other things in are marketing at this time but that would be an opportunity for us um and then total
34:16
number of people that have come to the page as entrances like they came to our site for this page in their experience
34:24
this shows me that there's quite a few folks that have actually come to our page from outside sources is this is the
34:29
first place they they saw us um this is what it looks like in HubSpot as well but I like this view even better so this
34:34
tells me that we had the majority of our page views for this landing page were driven by email marketing so this is the
34:41
piece when we're talking about like how do I improve landing page performance you have to think about how am I sending
34:46
traffic to the landing page because if you'll notice here like organic search we've got not a whole lot of people are
34:51
coming and that's because they're probably not finding it or in organic search they're probably finding it
34:57
through the two mechanisms up here and that's usually where most of your Landing Page Track traffic is going to
35:02
come it's either going to come from email marketing or getting social or paid traffic or in this case direct traffic is usually email that's lacking
35:09
the the the tracking parameters or it might be somebody that put it in a a referral like a slack or something that
35:15
just didn't have tracking attached so again this gives me a little bit better rate but I still don't see conversion
35:20
right here so hang with me for a second so this is actually in reports report
35:26
collections Channel performance lead capture woo took a lot to get there but this is where you can use a report out
35:33
of the box to understand your conversion rate so suddenly Tada there's the percentage that we've been looking for
35:40
now again I'm kind of curious on hubs spots and like is this how they get you to get to the reporting function instead
35:45
of showing you in the landing page I don't know but it does show you landing page uh conversion there and then if it
35:50
will show you all your landing pages so you can actually go down here and see that it looks like this is actually
35:56
really cool our landing page conversion rate for both of our webinar series the flywheel is a little bit lower maybe 1%
36:03
than the HubSpot series webinars for the product updates but they're pretty consistent if I was a marketer and I was
36:09
looking at this and all of a sudden we had a lower percentage rate for this one that would be cost for me to go okay why
36:15
what's happening how can I dig into this you'll notice that all of our um where did my M go on this tofu this is our top
36:22
of funnel ebook offer form we've got 36% conversion right there so we may have some better quality ification to do or
36:28
we might just be sending people to that page that um you know just aren't qualified so that's how to look at that
36:34
so what is a good conversion rate okay if you do get asked this this is the way to think about this so HubSpot put out
36:41
some data based on their surveys there's a lot of other companies that have put out data as well unbounce is one of them
36:46
but the average across according to HubSpot the average of all landing page performance across you know all the pages that they they looked at was 5.89%
36:55
okay let's take some silence to just realize how low that is and how high a lot of people's expectations are moment
37:01
of silence everybody um it is like we'll we'll have these conversations with clients and it's like man our landing
37:07
page is only converting at 12% what can we do and I was like um you can throw a party because that's pretty good but
37:14
then they see 60% which I just showed you and they're like wow how do I get 60% okay we'll get there in a second but
37:19
10% is going to be your Target and typically again a good conversion rate
37:25
if you're looking for 60% on webinars you might say you know okay well your webinar pages are 60% but what about our
37:30
contact us or book a for book a demo page this is probably more of what your sales team your board your leadership
37:37
might be concerned about is is this um this you know bottom of funnel so first of all every industry is a little bit
37:43
different if you are looking for benchmarks the first thing I would encourage you to do is is look to see if there are industry benchmarks for your
37:49
type of company again I think what you're going to find is it's going to be kind of relative like this but then in
37:54
my experience the biggest challenge is that your trying to increase a landing
38:00
page conversion on what you want is like a lead that's ready to buy now so if you
38:05
know that your contact us form or in this case a book a call form is only booking at let's say 4% yes you probably
38:13
have room to grow with that one if your book a call with us form is booking at 20% you're probably actually doing
38:20
really well and you just need to educate your team that you're doing well but setting your own benchmarks if you
38:25
haven't started tracking benchmarks use those reports that I just showed you to go figure out what your benchmarks are
38:30
if you don't have benchmarks for your own company you're going to have a challenge figuring out where to pull levers and how to communicate the data
38:37
to your team and again you can come off looking like man we're just not doing a good job whereas you're actually dealing
38:42
with an audience that doesn't understand what the metrics benchmarks are for your company and so if you say hey guys
38:48
actually last month our performance was 10% this month it's 15 we're actually doing really well because they heard 15
38:54
and they're like wow that sounds low Okay so let's dive into common landing page mistakes because these mistakes
39:00
will actually be what are may be costing you some of those conversions but before we do real quick we've got another
39:05
webinar coming up in about two weeks that is our um HubSpot updates webinar we do one every month the first week of
39:11
the month um my business partner Tyler he does lead these so many updates from HubSpot in the last um even two weeks
39:18
since we last did I guess week since last week's webinar um that are out so go ahead and join us for that every
39:25
webinar we do is on this webinar's page as well so make sure and register for those all right so number one the
39:30
landing page mistakes that people make number one focusing on the wrong metrics so let's go back to this math equation
39:37
and this is what I love so I'm kind of a math nerd I I was the state trigonometry champion in my high school that's right
39:44
folks um this is not trade but it is really important convergence so if it's
39:49
like you know what Ali I have 10% I want to get to 15% let's talk about how to
39:54
make that number move actually what we should be thinking about is the total makeup of where that number came from so
40:02
on a sample size let's say again for just our clean math we've got a 10% conversion rate so we had 10 submissions
40:08
from 100 visitors you know what we really need to push that like I I read in these blogs that if we can get a 2%
40:14
increase on our landing pages alley if we get 2% we would get a lot more more uh leads okay if we get a 2% conversion
40:22
increase in our specific situation here we get two more submissions
40:27
What If instead we focused on driving more traffic to the page and just kept with that original ratio well if we
40:33
double the traffic to the page and our cons now it's not always true that it always stays linear but if we drive more
40:39
traffic to the page we might end up actually doubling nearly doubling our actually yes doubling our um our number
40:46
of submissions in in a different approach so the reason I bring this up is not because you're doing the math
40:52
wrong it's often times what happens inside of organizations is
40:58
hey Ally we really want to get a better conversion percentage so we give that number to our agency or that number to
41:04
our team and we say we need 5% more conversions and let's actually back up and say what is actually what we want
41:11
out of the end and how can we get there in most cases I'm going to say the more visitors the more traffic getting to
41:16
that page is going to be the answer so think about that because again if if you have anything less than 100 visitors
41:22
anyway like any blog that talks about the color of your buttons or the placement of this or the copy like all
41:28
those things are going to be minuscule if you don't have enough people getting to the page so which brings me to the
41:33
next point and that is like to do the right math you have to drive traffic to your pages so according to HubSpot Again
41:39
part of this same study they did how are you driving traffic to your landing pages the top three were social media
41:45
promotion email and search Eng optimization now this one might be landing pages specific to key service
41:51
offering so I'm going to throw this one out because this is a little misleading um internal blog posts or calls out in
41:57
your in your um content is going to be one ctas and Banners across the website like let's say at the top on your
42:03
homepage it's like you know brand new guide that's going to drive them to a landing page so refer to this graph is
42:09
is a good idea because too many times like there's a lot of ways to use social
42:14
media to drive uh people to their landing pages but as we're going to talk about I think it's mistake number three
42:20
preview um we're going to talk about like if it doesn't look good on mobile like social media promotion is going to be a terrible way to send folks to your
42:26
Landing page because it's just not ready for you H so okay number two it was actually number two so mistake number
42:33
two is the bad user experience and really when we're talking about user experience it's the value proposition
42:38
needs to be above the fold it needs to look good on mobile especially if it's paid traffic so real quick um this is
42:45
maybe a more of a paid traffic um tip here but too many times I'll see
42:50
companies that are spending on paid traffic on mobile and tablet without even realizing it you can select what
42:57
platforms that shows up on and you can select whether or not your ads show up when they're connected to mobile or
43:02
Wireless or not so all of that might be a conversation with like folks who are doing your paid ads or if you need us to
43:07
look at that but but again your landing pages have to look good on mobile if they're going to convert at all um or
43:13
there's there's slow load time so again if they're clicking over and the page doesn't load fast enough we may think
43:19
two to three seconds sounds fast but if you set your phone for two three seconds and you sit there in silence it's
43:25
actually a very long time um you that are were just we watch Tik toks and we have zero you know attention span the
43:32
button text or the form has to be readable and again when we look at uiux sometimes we'll see like sections will
43:37
overlap or there isn't enough breakup in the text when it does get put on the
43:43
page that you end up with like runon paragraphs and bullets that are seven seven lines long like we we just can't
43:49
have that and then this one catches a lot of people by surprise if you have popups and slide-ins and HubSpot has a
43:55
great like CTA Builder do not have those on your landing pages because the landing page remember is a a core
44:02
outcome you need from that landing page you should not be like hey sign up for our webinar series and then bam newsletter and this and popup like do
44:09
not have that happen make sure your landing pages are the pages that you have like basically an exclusion in
44:16
those popups uh from Hub swap number three clutter Alexis and I were talking about this
44:22
right before we we started here I think the number one thing I see I think I've said number one like 12 times okay so
44:28
it's very common but a lot of a lot of the issue here it's just it's just too much so if you want to if you want to
44:37
look at the opportunity to better convert on a linking page I almost guarantee you're probably saying too
44:42
much or trying to say too much so one called to action again I think I've harped on that enough but visuals do a
44:49
lot to show off the products too many times I've had situations where even like a like I'll get a here's the
44:55
product information and then when it shows up on the website and goes back to the team for review it comes back with
45:00
twice as many words okay when we're creating content and showcasing products
45:07
and talking about features and benefits we actually have to use less words more effectively and by less words we also
45:14
can introduce video and visuals but there just has to be a better scheme and
45:20
as I went back to that drawing that I had left right left right left right scroll top to bottom your content has to
45:25
be organized in the way that they consume that diagrams charts mockups for posses and then if you're this is where
45:33
like ebooks and guides typically a mockup to show what they might expect what's behind this curtain is it going
45:39
to match my expectations we do not like to be surprised so lessen the element of
45:44
surprise unless it's a good surprise and on the back side all of a sudden they won $5 like Oh I like that I do not like
45:50
I'm gonna get an ebook and on the back side it's it's not helpful um and then if you have a product that or the
45:57
landing pages for something that's going to fix something highlight the end result so when you go through this
46:02
program for example if we went back to the leadership piece like on the landing page it might be like what your
46:08
firsttime managers may experience as a result of this program increase productivity like you know more time to
46:15
coach staff less time in meetings like what does it look like when you've done what the the promises on the landing
46:22
page so if you need something to read because you don't have enough
46:27
information I would highly recommend this book it's definitely a textbook read but even just if there's nothing
46:34
else like get the book and set it on your desk and repeat this to yourself daily don't make me think this is the
46:41
Mantra that we tend to use and we think about marketing these days period don't make me think the iPhone everybody has a
46:47
smartphone iPhone Android we've made our lives so that we kind of just intuitively know what to do and too many
46:54
times in bdb marketing we want to say all the things and we forget that people are intuitively making decisions so don't make me think this even just
47:01
having this Mantra when you think about Ling pages is important so number four the uh poor headlines in effective copy
47:07
we need copy that converts think about the 8020 rule headlines compel action bullets need to create curiosity and
47:14
create appetite we are in an era of clarity over cleverness any day if
47:19
you're trying to be too clever you have lost me I'm going to bounce off we live in an era where we used to be in person
47:25
in a sales presentation you had to sit through that presentation now if it's digital and you have me on a page and you're trying to be super clever bounce
47:32
I'm out I don't got time for this is us a targeted for a key Persona and then there needs to be Clarity on what the
47:37
visitor needs to know before they convert so again like too many times we're asking people to convert on a bottom of a funnel page but we don't
47:44
have enough information for them to actually know what to expect before they go through that page so a couple of cop
47:49
copywriting rewrites um there is a book that again I'd recommend I don't have it on here it's called Uh how to write copy
47:55
that sells by R Edwards but on the left hand side these are common things we see learn about our Workshop book a call get
48:00
our free ebook on the right hand side you can see this specific there's some element of curiosity here and there is a
48:07
very specific ask so this would be an example of how you might be able to do that so um what do the needs to know
48:14
this is an example for our path you might need help with HubSpot then you think can I fix it myself what if I
48:19
screw it up maybe I should hire them but are they qualified how long will it take what do I need to tell them and all
48:25
these red boxes are places they're probably going on the site looking for more information so you might be like
48:31
why didn't they convert right here well probably because they needed to get down here so what are the places that I could
48:37
create landing pages or offers or content that would help nurture them along that path so um this would be a
48:43
helpful exercise to do if your company hasn't done it yet but that's just an example from ours so I'm going to go
48:49
through and we're going to get to our examples here because I think those are going to be important um conversion we're fighting inertia I had a
48:56
conversation in email with one of you if you're still on the webinar here about um doubt and insecurity doubt insecurity
49:02
and fear are the things that are on the page will I get what you're promising me is it going to be worth my time um are
49:08
you going to spam me all that has to be true um and then I am I going to get that uh confirmation email so if you're
49:15
improving your landing pages here's the things that HubSpot is telling you and this deck's going to be available after
49:20
on our landing page so if you want to grab this this resource a video is going to be your top uh opportunity to
49:26
increase landing page conversion and the reason for that is the video gives a chance to establish a face and a name um
49:32
to that resource so let's say that you were registering for today's webinar and the video went something like this um
49:38
are you constantly creating landing pages but not really sure if you're doing it right or they're not even really converting well in this webinar
49:44
I'm going to teach you AB andc you can see that I'm a person you can see that I have authority and then you actually get
49:50
a better chance of knowing what to expect if our copy wasn't quite there so that's where videos can actually help
49:55
you convert quite well so don't forget this math but just a simple reminder the number one thing so
50:01
what everyone's been waiting for that will increase your conversions is matching the intent of your landing page and the language with the destination
50:07
they came from now I'm gonna read that again so match your intent and language on the landing page with where they came
50:13
from so let me give you an example so this would be hopspot CRM so if someone's searching for hopspot CRM this
50:20
is the destination that they're coming from they're coming from search this is a paid ad so I'm typing in HubSpot CRM
50:26
we can assume assume that someone's looking for the CRM or maybe if we even said CRM pricing um this is the ad I
50:32
click through to the ad and this is the landing page that I get so you'll notice that this landing page is not the same
50:37
as the HubSpot landing page homepage even though in ads you're forced to put basically a display URL but this isn't
50:44
Hobs spot's landing page like homepage this is their landing page for their ads and we've got two as I told as I said
50:50
before like this is the path get started or book a demo PS these both go to the
50:56
same places okay and then this is a social credibility piece and as I mentioned
51:01
prior this is an example of how they're using their chat bot down here to better
51:06
align with the original intent that someone had from that ad do you have questions about HubSpot CRM I have
51:12
answers so again it's a little teeny piece but I think it's really powerful and a good example to follow this is an
51:18
example from Twitter this is notbook clip post and Opus clip is something that takes your viral your video and
51:24
supposedly turns it into viral shorts um traded uh let's just say that it's not quite as like as as I like it but it's
51:32
that there's still work involved so this is what it's promising me so turn any video into 20 plus varable shorts
51:38
okay has anybody noticed the difference in numbers wait what you said 20 plus
51:43
wait one long video 10 viral Clips 10 times faster suddenly all the numbers all the things you know CTA CTA CTA if
51:52
they literally just said okay this is my ad turn any video into 20 viral shorts
51:57
the page in my opinion should be here's how to turn a 20 a video into 20 viral shorts sign up start today if it's free
52:06
screw all this other stuff on the page you're Miss missing the boat uh this is an email that I got from the Gardner
52:11
again like I'm using these these are real companies like we know them they're big um introducing the chief marketing
52:17
officer Journal even download now I would advise this should say download the journal or get the journal and this
52:25
then takes me to this page which is like shall I share it first or shall I read over here first like what are all these
52:31
numbers and what's going on and become a client big companies can get away with this kind of stuff because they just have so much volume when you as a small
52:39
company follow the like something like this and try to do what they're doing you will fail because there's just too
52:44
many things here that can can go AR so take an action from today's uh webinar take inventory of your landing pages do
52:51
you have one at every stage of the buying Journey if you don't you certainly need to because that's going to affect your overall conversion right
52:57
um go find those top performing landing pages and identify your metrics and benchmarks today how are you performing
53:03
what are one or two things you could do to improve don't improve don't pick everything if you're going to change one thing add something above the fold see
53:10
if that changes I will I will bet that for most people on the call here today you w you probably need to improve the
53:17
amount of traffic coming to your pages before you make any big changes but um test iterate and repeat and then again
53:24
don't forget to drive traffic to the page itself so that's what we have for today um lots of opportunities to I
53:30
think do some custom uh review if anybody is interested but definitely uh hope that you can see some improvement
53:36
after today

[Music]
0:11
[Music]
0:15
so today i'm going to be talking to you
0:17
about designing your course platform and
0:19
landing page
0:21
um very excited to be here my name is
0:23
orite i'm the creative director at
0:25
coarse creek
0:27
and today we're talking specifically
0:30
about this implementation
0:31
so you saw this this chart here that
0:33
robert showed you earlier with the
0:35
different
0:35
phases we're talking specifically about
0:38
implementation
0:39
so you're building your platform where
0:43
your course sits but also your landing
0:46
pages maybe your your lead magnets and
0:48
we'll talk more about that as well later
0:50
um but you're offering basically right
0:52
so this is kind of
0:54
what a platform funneling strategy
0:58
looks like so you might have
1:01
an entry-level course like a mini course
1:03
out on a third-party platform like udemy
1:05
or skillshare
1:07
you might be funneling people from
1:09
social media doing some content
1:11
marketing there
1:12
or doing paid advertising but all of
1:14
that traffic is funneling
1:17
onto this your website your beautiful
1:20
high converting website and this is
1:23
where you're offering your course this
1:25
is where you're letting people know who
1:26
you are
1:27
and what you have to offer and how you
1:30
can help them
1:31
so it's extremely important to
1:34
make a good first impression and to make
1:37
sure that your
1:38
your design and your layout and what
1:40
you're saying on your page and your
1:42
website as well
1:43
is in line with your target audience
1:46
and what problems they're going through
1:50
so i have over a decade experience in
1:52
digital marketing
1:54
and course creation graphic design all
1:57
types of
1:58
different elements in the marketing
1:59
space i worked with
2:01
all the way from solo printers to
2:03
organizations major influencers
2:06
many different clients in different
2:08
areas i actually
2:10
i graduated from the university of
2:11
british columbia with a psychology
2:13
degree and also
2:14
i took some pre-med pre-medicine courses
2:17
i was supposed to go to med school
2:20
but realized it wasn't for me long story
2:22
short because i wanted to do something
2:24
more
2:25
creative and um so i started a business
2:28
and started creating
2:29
basically in short creating specifically
2:32
marketing materials
2:34
and websites because i had to learn how
2:36
to do all of that
2:37
for myself and my business and as i was
2:40
learning
2:41
other people were asking me how to do
2:43
this so
2:44
you know what i do infuses the best of
2:47
all three three of those worlds it's
2:49
it's marketing it's design and it's
2:50
psychology
2:52
um we're in the business of people
2:54
doesn't matter what you're selling
2:55
we have to speak to we have to speak to
2:58
people's problems and challenges and
3:00
struggles and
3:01
and let them know that what we have
3:03
created
3:04
is is going to help them so
3:07
um i i can geek out over this stuff for
3:10
for hours i love learning what makes
3:11
people click
3:12
what color combinations um make someone
3:15
feel luxurious
3:16
versus cool common collected versus bold
3:19
and ready to take action
3:21
um and you know but ultimately what it
3:24
comes down to
3:26
and these are the two questions that i
3:27
focus on for all of my clients is
3:30
how can i make a great first impression
3:33
in seconds when someone lands on that
3:36
website
3:37
and how can i immediately capture
3:40
attention
3:40
and keep them engaged and lead them to
3:43
buy
3:44
to buy my course so um you know
3:47
immediately capturing attention has to
3:50
do with
3:50
those visuals the layout you know um
3:54
what your headline what you're saying
3:56
there right right away because people
3:58
aren't going to sift through all this
4:00
text you can't expect them to read
4:02
everything they're going to get that
4:03
information in seconds with your design
Before After
4:06
so your design and copy must be
4:09
attractive
4:10
because this is what ultimately converts
4:12
your customer
4:13
to buy from you so just to show you
4:17
a few examples here i'm going to do a
4:19
few before and afters so
4:21
this is a client site that he has a
4:24
course
4:27
uh it's a course specifically that helps
4:29
leaders
4:30
with um building great teams and just um
4:34
helping helping leaders become
4:36
outstanding leaders themselves
4:38
so this was something you know if you
4:41
land on it ultimately
4:43
what we see right away here is this
4:46
image the picture itself captures
4:48
attention we have tom looking at us
4:50
which is great it's compelling
4:52
but it's kind of confusing where to look
4:54
um it's
4:55
there's a lot of information happening
4:57
and actually i think you can
4:58
probably see this better if i just pull
5:00
up the website here
5:02
um so there's a ton of links at the top
5:04
there's there's
5:05
a ton of texts and it's like where where
5:08
do we look
5:09
you really want to use design to guide
5:12
the eye
5:13
where to look so it's important in the
5:16
use of colors
5:17
in the size of your text with your
5:19
headline and your headline
5:21
shouldn't necessarily be what the name
5:24
of your course is
5:25
it should be something that communicates
5:29
what transformation you can provide
5:31
to your your client uh it should be
5:34
something that
5:34
lets them know how you can solve a
5:37
problem for them
5:39
we really only get that information you
5:41
know if we do
5:42
read this text down at the bottom here
5:44
there's something that says
5:46
become outstanding leaders well that's
5:48
the transformation
5:50
that we're selling to someone who's
5:52
landing on the site but
5:53
you know they only get down here before
5:55
they can actually see it
5:57
and there's all these you know extra
5:59
links and there isn't really even
6:01
an enroll button or how do we even buy
6:05
this course
6:06
um so this is what we did for tom here
6:08
is
6:10
right off the bat you're landing on here
6:12
it's pretty obvious where to look
6:14
dead center become an outstanding leader
6:16
deliver legendary results
6:18
if that message specifically
6:21
communicates to someone who lands on
6:23
here and someone's like oh
6:24
yeah i want to do that that's something
6:26
that i want to achieve
6:28
they're going to be compelled to
6:29
continue reading on and
6:31
you can see here as i'm scrolling down
6:33
the page again
6:35
i'm guiding the eye through design where
6:38
to look it's pretty obvious
6:40
there's no i mean i'm forcing you where
6:43
where to look
6:44
and what to read because there's nothing
6:46
else anywhere
6:47
on the sides or at the top it's you know
6:50
all laid out
6:51
this way so that we can communicate
6:54
clearly
6:55
what's going on here with this course
6:57
and also using you know buttons to be a
6:59
different color
7:00
there's an entire there's so many
7:02
studies on color of buttons and which
7:04
colors convert best and that kind of
7:06
thing
7:07
ultimately you have to do a lot of split
7:09
testing but generally it's
7:11
you know orange green uh you know bold
7:14
colors that really stand out
7:16
from every other color that you have on
7:17
the page is going to
7:19
be more compelling and what you say on
7:21
those called actions as well
7:23
is important so you know we
7:26
again using design we wanted to create
7:29
visual elements here even though
7:31
the modules in this course that he's
7:33
selling they're just video trainings
7:35
it's just
7:35
you know they're all separate videos but
7:38
we're just creating something concrete
7:40
and tangible because it is a digital
7:41
product offering so let's make it just a
7:43
little bit more tangible with what they
7:45
get
7:46
you know showing them here the course is
7:48
accessible on all different devices
7:51
again using different colors is just
7:54
more compelling
7:55
compelling this way and it makes it
7:56
easier to navigate and that's really
7:58
what you want to do is just simplify
8:01
create
8:02
clarity and um and it's got to be clean
8:05
in this way um with absolutely like
8:08
remove the clutter another just quick
8:11
example here as well
8:14
with jeff um so let's go open this up
8:17
here
8:18
uh his headline right at the top when
8:20
someone lands on his website
8:22
jeff is a a marriage counselor or
8:25
relationship
8:25
expert so he has here i'll help you move
8:29
forward
8:30
this is something that's very vague you
8:32
don't want to again leave any question
8:35
in the mind
8:35
of your your potential clients you want
8:38
to tell them specifically
8:40
how you can help them we all hope that
8:43
our products and services create
8:44
positive change in the lives of others
8:46
but tell them what that is even this
8:49
button here let's talk it kind of blends
8:51
into the background
8:52
it doesn't really stand out and we need
8:55
to again
8:56
use design use colors um and
8:59
and this contrast this idea of contrast
9:02
to really
9:03
guide the eye and where to look so i
9:06
created something like this for him
9:08
where right when you land meet your
9:11
relationship coach
9:12
jeff and then he's specifically again
9:15
saying
9:15
how he's helped people with this
9:18
transformation
9:19
um i've helped thousands of men and
9:21
women who have broken trust in the
9:22
relationship
9:23
go from problem serious betrayals
9:26
with seemingly irreversible damage to
9:29
solution
9:29
transformation success rebuilding loving
9:31
relationships
9:33
join the boot camp this is a direct call
9:35
to action here
9:37
there's also another type of call to
9:38
action which is called a transitional
9:40
call to action so if someone's not ready
9:42
to buy from you yet
9:43
directly at least have some form of
9:46
blade magnet
9:47
here which is an opt-in freebie an
9:50
offering it could be a guide
9:52
it could be a series of video trainings
9:55
um
9:55
you know a an e-book whatever it is that
9:58
you have to offer here
10:00
you're offering value in exchange for
10:02
their email address so at least
10:04
you can continue to engage with them
10:07
and tell them about your course um
10:09
through your emails and
10:11
and keep that communication going with
10:13
your your customer and that lead magnet
10:15
is really something again that's
10:17
compelling the topic of it
10:19
is is um is really like
10:22
the sexy offering that someone's looking
10:24
for to their problem
10:26
and it's a little bit of what they're
10:29
gonna get their
10:29
their it's it's again a first impression
10:32
of your content
10:33
and how it can help them before they're
10:35
ready to actually go ahead and buy
10:37
your online course so reduce clutter
10:41
quickly capture attention again you have
10:43
seconds to do that
10:44
clear call to actions something that
10:47
says um
10:48
download your free ebook now
10:52
is more compelling than download now or
10:55
even learn more um again eliminate the
10:58
vague
10:59
be specific be tangible
11:02
so this is how i kind of work with my
11:05
clients
11:05
is segregating it into
11:09
these steps because it can be very
11:12
tempting to just dive in
11:13
and start designing these things these
11:15
creative assets and
11:16
and the landing page but we need to be
11:19
grounded
11:20
in our messaging that's the most
11:22
important because that's what's going to
11:23
stay consistent across
11:25
your you know your course creation
11:28
you're building out your platform
11:29
as well as launching your course so get
11:32
to know your market
11:34
very well research your market see what
11:35
other people are your competitors are
11:37
offering
11:38
to and and see how you can make them
11:40
better read the feedback
11:42
on those courses as well get
11:45
clear on your brand identity and
11:47
messaging
11:49
you got to know exactly who you are what
11:51
you stand for and very specifically
11:54
we use a tool that is called the story
11:57
brand script
11:58
so i kind of use this and walk with my
12:00
clients
12:01
through it's kind of like a story line i
12:03
mean every every
12:04
movie follows this kind of plot from
12:07
character
12:08
so really defining what your target
12:10
audience wants
12:11
uh what problems do they have uh
12:14
you are the guide in their storyline and
12:17
the story is about them
12:18
not you so again that ties that goes
12:21
back to
12:22
how you know in your landing page it's
12:24
not about your
12:25
the title of your course it's about how
12:27
you can help them and create that
12:29
transformation for them
12:30
so we go through this script to really
12:32
get clear
12:33
on messaging um and get really grounded
12:36
in that so that we can make sure that is
12:38
in the forefront
12:40
so the other thing as well step three is
12:42
really about creating a map
12:45
that is a brand guide so the brand guide
12:48
is a tool
12:50
that just you know helps everyone stay
12:53
on the same page
12:54
in terms of messaging branding
12:57
layout design it's really important
12:59
especially when you're working with
13:00
other
13:01
subcontractors or agencies to help you
13:03
out in this process
13:05
having something that clearly states
13:07
what colors to use
13:08
your logo your fonts and how it how it
13:12
works together
13:13
see all these elements working together
13:16
is important because you're going to
13:17
take that
13:18
and you're going to put that messaging
13:20
and the that layout that design
13:22
again everywhere on your platform on
13:24
your social media sites
13:26
um everywhere that you're engaging with
13:29
customers
Graphics Assets
13:32
so the other thing here the next step is
13:36
once you've done all of that foundation
13:39
and you're grounded there in your
13:40
messaging
13:41
then you create your graphics and assets
13:44
and these are some of the things that i
13:46
create specifically
13:48
for my clients who are selling their
13:51
courses
13:52
and it's lead the first thing on there
13:54
you see here is the lead magnet and
13:56
again i have this
13:57
as an example to show you um again
14:00
it's that really compelling offer for
14:03
someone to opt in
14:04
but it's designed with the same branding
14:08
and it at the end gives a call to action
14:11
to get people to take the next step and
14:14
this is specifically
14:16
uh diving into his course his um boot
14:19
camp
14:19
trust building boot camp course so after
14:21
they've received this
14:23
they're asked to um start with them here
14:26
that this this button right here goes
14:28
directly to his landing page
14:30
to the trust building boot camp so
14:33
there's the lead magnet there's also an
14:36
important one is the
14:37
hero website banner so this is this
14:41
first thing that they see when they land
14:43
on your
14:44
site what is that messaging what does it
14:46
look like
14:47
what feeling does it emote
14:50
that's really important and also the
14:52
call to action
14:53
is important as well
14:57
other things that you may want to
14:59
consider creating
15:00
is 3d product graphics like i showed you
15:03
before there
15:04
so make a visual representation of your
15:07
digital offering
15:08
it's way more compelling uh
15:11
it's tangible people can see what
15:13
they're getting and
15:15
it's you know showing it on different
15:16
devices or
15:18
separate pages like this is just going
15:20
to
15:21
increase the quality of your your site
15:24
and
15:24
also it's going to engage better with
15:26
your your potential customers
15:29
and then again taking that design and
15:31
branding into social media so here i
15:33
created a facebook
15:34
group banner actually it's his first
15:37
facebook page
15:39
facebook page banner with um
15:42
again the feeling the branding it's all
15:44
there it's consistent
15:46
happy marriage uh and also a call to
15:49
action
15:49
so put your call to actions everywhere
15:52
um
15:52
download our free guide and this button
15:54
goes to the on the facebook page you can
15:56
change the call to action button so we
15:58
have it at
15:59
i think is sign up and that goes to them
16:02
opting in and here again linkedin banner
16:05
specifically says what he what
16:07
transformation he
16:08
he he plays a part in rebuilding
16:10
relationships from crisis to connection
16:13
so all of those things um tie in
16:16
together
16:17
and make an impression uh the biggest
16:21
mistake people make in terms of design
16:23
with their
16:24
course platform and their landing page
16:25
is that they make a poor first
16:27
impression uh so really don't overlook
16:30
the design
16:30
aspect of building and launching your
16:33
online platform
16:35
you have seconds to make an impression
16:38
so
16:38
make sure you communicate immediately
16:41
what you're about
16:42
and how you can help your potential
16:44
customer
16:45
um you know your your layout your design
16:48
your copy your call to actions
16:50
all of that plays a role and
16:53
and make sure that you you make it easy
16:55
for people to buy
16:56
as well um don't don't
17:00
make it difficult for them to find that
17:02
buy now button uh
17:04
or take away you know take away all
17:06
those questions in their mind about
17:08
whether you know confusion about your
17:10
offer or confusion about whether you can
17:13
provide
17:13
the result that they seek so this is the
17:16
one
17:16
major takeaway that ties absolutely
17:19
everything that i've talked about
17:20
together
17:21
and that's a confused mind never
17:24
buys so make sure your design is clear
17:28
it's actionable your your viewer
17:31
shouldn't be left questioning
17:32
anything uh because if so you might be
17:34
leaving money on the table
17:36
and you know if it's hard for you to
17:39
judge to make that judgment because
17:40
sometimes we get so close to our own
17:42
content
17:42
that it's hard to see things from a
17:44
bird's eye perspective
17:46
but if that's hard then you know talk to
17:48
get your colleagues ask for your
17:49
colleagues feedback your partners
17:51
your existing clients or even us as well
17:54
you know but get that get that down make
17:57
sure
17:57
that your design is compelling and
17:59
engaging
18:00
so that you can convert and sell more of
18:03
your courses
18:04
so thank you very much for your time and
18:06
i'm happy to answer any questions as
18:07
well
18:10
thanks so much for that uh hurry that
18:12
was a really excellent
18:14
i i noted down earlier and what you're
18:15
talking um
18:17
that um you know communicating
18:19
communicating the transformation you can
18:21
provide is so critical and
18:23
that's critical for any business but you
18:24
know if you're in if you're in the
18:26
business of education if you're trying
18:27
to teach people you want them to learn
18:28
something
18:29
you know they're doing that because they
18:30
want an outcome they don't want to take
18:32
a course
18:32
um i mean that people don't go out and
18:34
wake up in the morning say i really want
18:35
to take a course they wake up and say
18:37
i really want to change my life in this
18:38
specific way and i think your other
18:40
point about really being specific about
18:43
that being clear
18:44
being concise being to the point
18:45
eliminating confusion when somebody
18:47
shows up on your site they ought to be
18:48
able to see
18:49
this is what this person is going to
18:50
help me do and here's what i need to do
18:52
to take advantage of that
18:53
period you know if you if you go look at
18:56
your own site right now i'll give you
18:58
permission to leave for a little bit go
18:59
go take a look at it just load it up
19:00
real quick and look at it does it do
19:02
that for you
19:03
um and if it doesn't that that's your
19:04
starting point for for work on it
19:08
fantastic
19:10
you


-----


What's up guys? Welcome back to the channel. In this video, I am going to show you how to create a high converting
0:06
landing page that you can use to sell your online course. So, if you look at
0:12
the page that I have right here, we have the main section with my VSSL for this
0:18
course. So, once I start driving traffic to this page, the first thing people see
0:23
is this video. And once they go through it and they like what I'm selling, they
0:29
can click the join now button to buy this course. But we also have other sections like the about me section where
0:37
I got to introduce myself briefly because usually when selling anformational product, people want to
0:44
know if you have the experience and the expertise to teach them what you are
0:49
trying to sell. Then we have this benefit section where I listed what people will get from this course. We
0:56
have another call to action button. And then I have this section where I talked about why people love this course
1:03
particularly. So you need a unique selling point. What would differentiate your own course from what everybody else
1:09
is selling out there. Then as usual, if you are trying to sell something, reviews and testimonials are very
1:16
important. So, I have this section with reviews from people who have already taken the course. Then, we have another
1:23
call to action and frequently asked questions to answer some of the questions that customers might have. And
1:30
by the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to create a landing page like this for yourself. And let's say
1:37
somebody comes over here and they want to buy my course, they can just click on the join now on button and that will
1:42
bring them over to the course page where they will see the full outline of this course. Now, if you remember, we able to
1:49
set up this course together in my previous video. So, if you've not seen that video, I recommend you watch it to
1:56
see how to set up your brand new website and how to set up your course. So, we
2:02
covered everything in that video and the link will be in the description. But basically, once they come over here and
2:09
they decide to buy, I can add it to my cart and proceed to check out. Here we
2:14
have Pay Stack as our payment method that customers can use to conveniently
2:20
pay for this course. And once they complete the payment, they'll get access to the course automatically while you
2:26
make your cool cash. So, I'll show you how to set up something like this for yourself. But before we get started, I
2:32
need to mention that I am hosting this website on Hostinger. And I picked
2:38
Hostinger for two main reasons. The first is because they ensure that I get
2:43
the best experience when setting up my website. Hostinger is very easy. You can
2:48
set up your website in just a few simple clicks. Then the second reason is the
2:54
fact that Hostinger will ensure that anybody who buys my course or anybody
2:59
who visits my website will get the best user experience because with Hostinger
3:05
my website is fast, secured and reliable. Students will not experience
3:10
any form of delay or any kind of issues when trying to access the course. So, if
3:16
you want to set up a new website and you want to get the best results both for
3:21
yourself and for your customers, then I recommend you use Hostinger. The good
3:26
thing is their Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales is currently on. So, if you
3:32
click the first link in the description of this video right now, you get up to
3:37
78% discount on any of their hosting plans. For this website, I picked the
3:44
premium plan and the 24 months period because that will ensure that I get a
3:50
free domain name for one year, which is an extra benefit for me. And this will
3:55
cost just 2,900 NRA per month. And when you go to check out, you'll see this
4:02
area for have a coupon code here. What you want to do is to check the description of this video again. You'll
4:08
see my coupon code right here. AD AA NU and this will give you an extra 20%
4:14
discount from your total bill. So you can use this to save some money for
4:20
yourself. And one problem I have noticed when trying to buy services like this from Nigeria is that sometimes your card
4:27
does not work. But the good thing with Hostinger is that you can conveniently pay for any of their services with your
4:36
OP account. And that's the payment method that I used to buy the hosting
4:41
for this website. Once again, the link and the coupon code will be in the description below. Just go ahead, get
4:48
your hosting, set up your website, and now let's dive in and build our landing
4:53
page. So, from the previous video, I already showed you how to set up WordPress. Just open your WordPress
4:59
dashboard. From the previous video, we installed this Astra theme. So if you
5:06
don't have ASCAR, you can just go to add theme, then install and activate this
5:12
ASCAR theme. Then we also installed some plugins. The ones we are going to use
5:18
right now is Elementor and start templates. If you don't have
5:24
these two plugins on your website, you can just go to add plugin, search for Elementor.
5:30
You'll see it right here. Install and activate it. also search for starter
5:36
templates and then do the same for this as well. But I already have these two
5:42
plugins. So we are going to use them to build our course landing page. To get
5:48
started, just go to pages, click add page. For the page title, I'm going to
5:54
use landing page. or you can just use the title of your course as the page
6:00
title because that will help with your site SEO. Then come over to template.
6:07
You'll see template on the sidebar right here. Change the template from default template to Elementor full width. Now
6:15
click publish. Then the next step is to open Elementor where we'll do most of
6:21
the work. So over here you will see edit with Elementor. Just click on it and
6:27
that will open the element page builder. The good thing is Elementor is beginner
6:32
friendly and super easy to use. And since it is a visual editor, it just
6:37
feels as if you are working on a design tool. So while you are building your page, you can actually see what the
6:44
final product will look like right inside the editor. Now, before we start adding different elements to this page,
6:52
the first thing I want to do is to set the colors and the fonts I'll use
6:58
throughout the project. That will make the process easier. Instead of trying to reenter the same colors over and over
7:04
again or trying to set the same font over and over again, you can just set them as presets and then if you need to
7:12
style any element with that color, you can just select it. So what you want to
7:17
do is click on this element logo at the top left corner. Then go to site
7:22
settings. Here you will see design system theme style and settings. Under
7:29
design system you'll see global colors and global fonts. Let's start with
7:34
colors. So go to global colors. Here you'll notice that there are four default colors. Primary, secondary,
7:42
text, and ascent. Now, you can decide to modify these default colors, but what
7:48
I'm going to do instead is to add my own custom colors. I already have the colors
7:54
I want to use and the color codes. So, I'll just copy the first color, which is
8:00
red. Come over here, click add color, and then select this color palette.
8:07
Add the color value for the color I want to bring in. This is the first color and
8:13
you can decide to name it. Let me just use red. So this is the red color I'll
8:18
use throughout my website. Then I'll repeat the same for the purple color.
8:25
Click add color. Enter the color code and then set the
8:30
name to purple. I can just go ahead and repeat this same process for the remaining colors.
8:37
Once you have everything in place, click save changes. Now let's go to fonts.
8:43
Click global font here. I'll change the primary font to Monserat. You can search
8:51
for any font you need right here. Or you can even upload your own custom font. Then for the weight, since I intend to
8:58
use this font for headings, I'll change the weight to 700. Then transform to
9:05
upper case and also increase the font size a little bit. I think 45 pixels
9:11
should do. You don't need to get it perfectly right now because even while building your page, you can still edit
9:17
the text and the colors whichever way you want. Then I'll go to the secondary
9:23
color. Set this to Monterat as well, but this time the font weight is going to be
9:28
500. And then the size will be around 30 pixels. For the text, I'll use a font
9:36
called enter. Then increase the font size to around maybe 18 pixels. And
9:43
repeat the same for the final option which is accent. Set the font family to
9:50
enter. Set the size to like 14 pixels.
9:55
And once you have all of this in place, click save changes. Now that we are done organizing the colors and the font, it's
10:03
time to get into the main part. So let's go over to the page editor again. Now
10:09
the first part of every page is the hero section and that's what we are going to
10:14
start with. And if you remember earlier we installed a plug-in called starter templates and I mentioned that it is
10:22
going to make the process easier for us because we'll get templates for different sections on our landing page.
10:29
So over here you'll see this starter template icon. Click on it. Here you'll
10:34
see customizable page templates. So if you want to bring in an entire page, you
10:41
can select one of these. But right now we need a template for our hero section.
10:48
So come over to blocks here. You will see templates for different sections. So
10:54
instead of trying to build everything up from scratch, you can just use these as shortcuts to get things done faster. So
11:01
you can use this search box to search for the section you are looking for or
11:07
you can just come over and click this drop down and you'll see different options. Right now we need a template
11:13
for our hero section. So I'll select hero. Now you'll see templates for
11:18
different style and layout. You just want to pick the one that you like for your website. I actually like this
11:25
particular one. So I'll select it. One of the reasons why I am picking this
11:30
particular template is because it has an area where I can embed my video. But you
11:37
can still pick a template without video placement and still add your own video manually. But usually it is better to
11:44
just pick a template that looks closely like the final product you have in mind.
11:49
So because I want to add my VSSL to the hero section, I will go with something that has an area where I can embed my
11:58
video. So once you select the template that you like, just click import block.
12:04
As usual, I already have the content I want to use for my landing page. So the
12:09
process will be faster. And what I need to do is to bring in my heading. just
12:16
copy this heading that I have right here and use it to replace this heading text.
12:23
So if you select any element, this editor will pop up on the left sidebar
12:29
and then I can just delete the old text. Paste my title. Then according to the
12:36
layout that I have here, after the title, we'll have like a subheading. Then we'll have the VSSL and a call to
12:44
action button. So I am going to delete this button. Then copy
12:51
my subtitle and paste it right here.
12:56
Then copy the link to my VSSL. So I just made a video, uploaded it to YouTube,
13:03
and then I'll use the link. Just select this video. You'll see the area where
13:09
you can post the link to your video. Just paste mine right there. Now, even
13:15
though we've already linked our video, let's say if I try to play this video, the actual video comes up, but you'll
13:22
notice that we still have this old image covering the video. So, to remove it,
13:27
you get all these different controls that you can use to customize your video. Let's say if you want the video
13:35
to start playing automatically once somebody gets to the page, you can enable autoplay. You can also mute it or
13:42
loop the video depending on what you want to do with your landing page, but
13:48
most times the default setup is just fine. The only thing I'll do is to come
13:53
over to image overlay and then disable this option. Now we have just the video
14:00
or let's say you want to add a thumbnail like an image to cover your video. You can just select the image you want to
14:07
use. But for now, I'll just disable this option. While you are doing all of this, don't
14:14
forget to save your changes. So, you click publish to save your work. Then,
14:19
to see a preview of what your website looks like, you can click on this
14:24
preview icon. And that will open your website on a new tab. This is what we
14:30
have so far. But even though we've added our title, subtitle, and VSSL, it is
14:37
still looking like the template we started with. So, let's do some styling to make this area look better. So, go
14:45
back to Elementor here. The first thing that I'm going to do is to select this
14:51
section. Then go to style, scroll down to background overlay, and
14:59
then I'll change the color of the overlay. And remember, we've already set the colors we want to use. So I'll use
15:07
the black color. Then select this text, go to style
15:13
and just increase the font size so that it is more pronounced. I will also
15:19
select the sub heading, go to style again, go to typography
15:25
and increase the font size as well. Maybe 20 pixels will do. Then for this
15:31
particular text, I'll go to advanced because currently the space between this text and the title and the video is too
15:39
much. So I'll just remove the top margin and the bottom margin as well. I think
15:45
this looks better. I'll also do the same for the video. The space between this video and this text is too much. So
15:52
select the video, go to advanced, then reduce the top margin to zero. Now, this
16:00
is looking good. Don't forget to save your changes and let's preview what we
16:06
have. All right, this looks better than what we started with. So, we'll move on
16:11
to the next section where I'm going to have like an about me because most times
16:18
before people will buy stuff from you, they need to know you to an extent. Especially considering the fact that
16:23
this is an online course, people want to know whether you have some kind of experience and some kind of expertise in
16:31
the knowledge you want to sell to them. So, I'm going to add an about me section. But before we do that, I just
16:38
want to show you something. When building your page, you can switch between desktop mode, tablet mode, and
16:45
then mobile mode because you don't want a situation where your website looks
16:50
good when people are using their laptops, but when they try to visit your
16:55
website with their phones, everything just looks out of place. For instance, you can see that on mobile, this text is
17:02
too big. So I can just select it, go to style, typography, and just reduce the
17:08
font size for mobile. The change I'm making on mobile view is going to affect
17:14
just the mobile version of the website. So I'm going to bring this down to a
17:21
very good level. Let's say 30 pixels. I think 30 pixels look good. I'll repeat the same for the subheading. Go to
17:28
style, typography, and reduce the font. So you can see that the mobile view now
17:36
looks better. And this is something you want to keep in mind while building your
17:41
page. You want to make sure that it looks good on desktop, on tablet, and on
17:46
mobile so that everybody can use your website regardless of the device that they use. Now with that out of the way,
17:53
let's move on to the next section, which is going to be the about me section. And just like we did with the first section,
18:01
we are going to use starter template. So just click on this starter template icon. Go to blocks. Then this time we
18:08
are looking for an about me section. So I'll select about and that will give us different templates that we can use for
18:16
this section. You just want to go to this template and pick the one that will fit into your website. For instance, I
18:22
am going to pick this particular template. So I'll just select it. Then click import block. Now you'll notice
18:30
that this new section is covering the top section. So to fix that, select the
18:36
section, go to advanced, and then add some top margin. Maybe I'll use 100
18:42
pixels or let's say 150. This looks better. And just like we did with this
18:48
section, you just want to bring the content you have for your about me and
18:53
then style it. So over here I already have the write up I want to use. I can
18:59
just copy all of these. Come over and paste.
19:05
Then we'll have something like this. I will delete the signature. To delete any
19:10
element just right click and then you'll see this delete option. With these icons
19:17
you can decide to link your social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. But I'm going to take this out
19:23
as well. Then I'll need to replace this picture with my own picture. So select
19:28
it. Then click choose image. Go to upload files and upload the picture you want to
19:35
use. Then click select. To make this image look like what we had on the
19:40
template, just come over to image resolution and change it from full to
19:46
custom. Now change the width to 650. Click apply. And this is looking good.
19:54
Then we need to style the text as well. So I'll select the about me title. Go to
20:00
style. I'll change the text color. Then select the second line. Go to style
20:06
again. Open typography. I'll reduce the font so that it is
20:12
smaller than the main heading. Then I'll change it from uppercase to capitaliz.
20:20
and also change the text color. Now I'll select this text.
20:27
Go to style again. I will change the text color. Then maybe adjust the font
20:33
size a little bit. Then I'll select this part.
20:38
Make it bold. All right, this looks better. Another thing I want to do is to
20:44
remove the drop shadow behind this video and also add a call to action button to
20:51
this section. So select this video. For this particular option, go to advanced.
20:57
Then scroll down and look for border. Here you'll see box shadow. Let me try
21:03
to reduce the intensity of this shadow. So, open the color and then reduce the
21:09
opacity. Maybe we'll keep it around this area. Now, this looks better. Then, the
21:17
next thing that I'm going to do is to bring in our call to action button. So,
21:22
click add elements. That open this widget area where you can add different
21:28
elements to your page. Let's say if you want to add a new button to your page,
21:33
just grab the button widget and drag it into the area where you want to place
21:39
your button. This is looking a little bit off, but we are going to fix it. And
21:44
one way to do that is by adding top margin to the button. So, select it,
21:50
come over to advanced, unlink the margin values, and then add a top margin of
21:57
maybe 150 pixels. But that does not really give me the kind of result I want
22:02
because I like the fact that this video is kind of overlapping the border of
22:08
this section. So what I'm going to do is to change the position property under
22:13
advanced. You'll see this position option. And you can change this to
22:18
either absolute fixed or use the default position. Right now for what I am trying
22:24
to achieve I'll use absolute. Then change the vertical orientation to
22:31
bottom. And then adjust the vertical offset to get the button to an area
22:37
where you like. Let's say minus 200 in this case. That means we need to
22:42
increase the top margin on this section so that they are not overlapping each other. So I just come over change the
22:49
top margin to 200 pixels or maybe 250.
22:54
Yeah, that looks better. Now select our button again. Go to style. Change the
23:01
position to center because I want the button on the center of the page. Then
23:06
I'll change the background color of the button. Let's say I want to use this red
23:12
color. I'll also adjust the padding to make the button look bigger. So we're
23:19
going to use a top padding of let's start with 10 pixels. Bottom padding 10.
23:25
Right and left will be 20 20. Still looking small. So I'll change the top
23:31
padding to 20. The same for the bottom padding. Then we'll use 40 and 40 for
23:39
the right and left padding or probably 50 and 50 for the right and left
23:47
padding. We also need to work on the text. So go to typography.
23:52
change the font weight to 700 so that it looks bold. I want the text in upper
23:58
case. So go to transform, select upper case and just adjust the font size to
24:04
like 18 pixels. To add a slight animation when you hover your mouse on
24:09
the button, go to hover and then come down to hover animation. I'll just
24:15
select grow. Now, if I drag my mouse on the button, you'll see that we get this
24:22
nice animation. Then I'll go to content. For the button text, I'll use join now.
24:29
And then this area where you have link, just add the link to your course. So
24:35
once people click on the join now button, it will take them to the check
24:40
out page where they can pay and get access to this course. So, with all of
24:45
this in place, I'll just click publish. Then, let's preview what we've done so far. And you can see this is beginning
24:53
to look like a proper landing page. The next step is to add a section where
24:59
we'll list the benefits people will get from this course. And at this point, you
25:04
already know the process. Just go to starter templates, go to blocks. This
25:09
time, we want to add a benefit section. So the option that we use is features.
25:15
Here you see templates that you can use to showcase your course benefits. And
25:21
let's say if you want to add a testimonial section, you can come over to testimonials and you'll see a lot of
25:30
testimonial templates. Basically, whichever type of section you need, you'll likely find a template for it
25:36
right here. Let's say if you want to add a call to action section of frequently asked questions, these are the different
25:43
blogs you probably need on your landing page. A lot of the time you find all the
25:49
templates you need right here, but there are cases where you need to improvise.
25:55
So right now that I want to add my cost benefits. I'll go to features, select
26:00
one of these templates. Maybe I am going to pick this. Then click import block.
26:06
And just like we did with the first two sections, you just want to go ahead customize and style this section. Then
26:13
basically repeat the same process for all the remaining sections you need on your landing page. For instance, in my
26:20
case, after I add the benefits, I'm going to include a section where I will
26:26
list why people love this course. Then I'll add another section for reviews and
26:32
testimonials. After that, we'll have a call to action. Then a section for the
26:37
frequently asked questions. So now that you know how the whole thing works, you just want to go ahead and complete the
26:44
rest of your landing page. So after everything, this is what my page looks like. We have the hero section, the
26:51
about me section, then the benefits section where I listed what people get
26:57
in the course. And then we have why people love discourse, reviews and
27:03
testimonials. Here we have a call to action section and finally frequently asked questions.
27:10
So at this point everything is in place. Now we just need to fix the header of
27:16
our site and I think the footer as well. You can see that right now there are too
27:22
many items on our menu. So to fix this, let's open the theme customizer. Just
27:28
click customize. And here the first thing that I'm going to do is to upload
27:33
our site logo. So go to header, open site title and logo. Select logo. Then
27:41
upload the logo for your website. This is the logo I'm going to use. Something
27:46
very simple that I made on Canva. So click select. I'm going to skip copying
27:53
and this is what it looks like. So we are going to reduce the width so that it is a little bit smaller. Then I am going
28:01
to remove the site title since we already have our logo showing up right here. So just uncheck title visibility.
28:10
This looks better. Then down here I'll go to site icon and upload your site
28:16
icon. I'll just use the same logo as my website icon. This is the icon that will
28:22
show up on browser tabs. Again, skip cropping,
28:28
then publish to save your changes. After the logo, let's work on the menu. So,
28:34
come over here, go to menus, click create menu,
28:41
and we are going to set this as the primary menu. So, make sure primary menu is checked.
28:46
Click next. Okay. I'll need to enter the name for the menu. So I'll just use primary
28:53
menu. Then click next. Now you can click add items.
28:59
Then select the items you want to have on your menu. For a website like this,
29:04
the only item I need on my primary menu is the link to students dashboard. But
29:12
you can add as many links as you want. But right now I'll just add a link where
29:18
users can visit their dashboard. So over here you can search through pages, post,
29:24
products, courses, lessons and stuff like that. So from pages I'll just look
29:29
for dashboard. This is it right here. Add it to the menu then save. So this is
29:36
it right here. Now let's go to the footer. Select footer. And here I'm not
29:42
going to do much. I'll just remove this powered by Astra text. So go to
29:47
copyright then use this text editor to delete that part. Then instead of using
29:54
the site title which is displaying my domain name I'll just use my name. So
30:00
something like this work save this. Another thing that we need to do here is
30:06
to set this landing page as our website homepage. So go back then go to homepage
30:14
settings for your homepage displays. Select a static page and then select the
30:21
landing page. So this is it right here. Remember we used the title of the course
30:27
as the name of the page. Then publish. And that's basically all you need to do
30:32
from this part. So let's see what our website looks like now. You can see that
30:38
we've cleaned up the header and everything basically looks good. Once we
30:43
start generating traffic to this page, people can come over here. If they want to buy this course, they can just click
30:50
on any of the call to action buttons. So, assuming that I want to take this
30:56
course, I'll click enroll now and that will open the course page with all the
31:01
information people need to know about this course. then I can add it to my
31:06
cart and proceed to check out. But here we have one problem. There is no payment
31:13
method that people can use to buy this course. So we need to fix that. And like
31:20
I mentioned at the beginning of this video, we are going to use pay tag as our payment method. But you can decide
31:27
to use any payment method you prefer, whether it's PayPal, Stripe, Flutterwave. And if you want to use any
31:33
of those methods, I've already made videos that will show you how to do that. But for Pastag, the only thing you
31:40
want to do is to make sure that you have WooCommerce and the Past plugin
31:45
installed on your website. So I have Past right here. So let's go to WooCommerce settings. Go to payment. If
31:54
you have the plug-in installed, here you see Past. Click complete setup. Here you
32:00
just want to enable past tack then you can decide to customize the title,
32:05
description and all this other stuff. But the most important thing is to add your pay
32:12
secret key and your public key. So to get that you need to set up a pay
32:18
account if you don't already have one. Then log your account. Click on this
32:24
account icon at the top right corner. Go to profile
32:30
then go to API keys and web hbooks. Here you will see two sets of API keys. The
32:37
live mode and the test mode. And from the name you probably already know that
32:42
this is what you will use to test the payment method. And when you are going
32:47
live with your website, this is what you should use. Right now let's use the test
32:52
mode. So I'll copy the test secret key. Go to commerce. Also on oocommerce you
33:00
have this test mode option. While testing you want to enable test mode but
33:06
when you are going live you want to disable this. So we have test mode enabled. Then I'll paste my secret key
33:16
and also copy the test public key. Paste it right here. Scroll down and click
33:22
save changes. You should also copy this webbook URL.
33:28
Go to paste tack. You will see the field for web hook URL. Paste it right here.
33:34
Then save. And with all of this in place, our payment method should start working properly. So let's go to the
33:41
check out page again. Refresh. And now you'll see that we have pay tag as our
33:47
payment method. So I'll proceed to place order. The good thing with pay stack is
33:54
that customers will get multiple options. So they can either pay with bank transfer, card, zap or USSD code.
34:02
So let's say I want to pay with card and just proceed to complete payment.
34:08
Payment successful. And now I have access to the course. So this is
34:14
basically how to set everything up. But before you launch your website, there
34:20
are still some things you need to do. Like I mentioned earlier, you need to go to live mode with your payment method
34:27
both on WCommerce and on Pack. Then you also need to go to site visibility
34:36
and change your website visibility from coming soon to live. This will make sure
34:42
that anybody will be able to access your website. Save changes. And finally, go
34:48
to settings. Use your course title as the site title. This will help with your
34:57
website SEO. You can also add a site tagline. Then save. With this, your website is
35:05
fully ready and you can start selling your course. So, I hope you found this

understand what landing pages are you understand what six pages are so you can go ahead and Skip you know just if
2:19
you're if you're watching this if you downloaded it you will see two folder Theory and design so go ahead and click
2:27
on the design folder and you can get started from there so the beginning here is what's a
2:33
landing page and what's the sales page landing pages
2:39
and sales pages are very similar because they are designed to convert visitors into customers
2:46
but there are differences you know there's some kind of differences so for
2:51
landing pages that's why the reason why they call it land you know like when you're Landing when a plane is landing
2:57
the reason they call it land is because it's just that best point of contact between you and your customer especially
3:05
if you're a solopreneur the main reason why people view landing page or why you want to be the landing
3:12
page is because you really want to um you really want the customer to take a
3:18
specific action that's the reason why you would use a landing page some of those actions could be filling
3:25
out of form it could be getting their WhatsApp number it could be booking a
3:30
card it could be you know it could be making a purchase sometimes but a lot of
3:36
times you really don't think that if I land on your page the first time I'm gonna make a purchase ah you I might
3:42
make a purchase if I like the product so much or if I know about you before then so but if I don't know about you I might
3:50
never ever make that project but what but my sixth page is focused on selling
3:56
something that's what the six pages focused on just selling selling selling so the
4:04
reason the reason why you build a sales page is because you really want to say hey once you come to my website I really
4:10
want you to make the purchase immediately for example if you sell fashion items
4:15
you will create a sales page and that's this page is for anyone who's coming to that website to make that purchase as
4:22
fast as possible that's the reason why they're coming to that website because you want them to make that purchase and
4:28
also for in terms of content landing pages are very minimal
4:34
they contain very minimal amount of content you know especially those landing pages that we want to give you
4:39
an ebook for you to leave your your um for you to leave your email address so you would see the ebook you would see
4:45
reasons why you should download the ebook and then you'll see a space where you should put your email address and that's it
4:52
but fit for for sales page they have tons and tons of content some persons
4:57
even add storytelling so they tell stories even how they met their mom how the business change their lives just so
5:05
many stories and ending why because they need to capture your attention not just your eyeballs they
5:11
need to capture your heart and at the end of the day capture um your pocket that's the way it is some of
5:18
this content might include testimonials uh my include pictures videos you know
5:25
jigs lots and lots of it just because they want to capture your attention then
5:30
when it comes to design I would say that for the sales page and the landing page they are really clean you make them very
5:36
very clean but when it comes to design landing pages they're very very clean and very minimal but for sales page yeah
5:42
they're not very clean because of the too many things that you're putting in there but when you take this course
5:49
you will learn how to create very very clean sales page that just takes a user
5:54
from where they are currently to where you want them to be so in summary sales
6:00
landing pages is focused on capturing leads you know visitors attention and directing them to perform a specific
6:06
action but for sales Pages it's focused on closing the sales so I hope you
6:12
understand that go ahead check out some pages on the internet and see the difference between a landing page and a
6:17
sales page I'm going to be showing you that here but just go ahead and figure it out yourself and join me in the next
6:23
session thank you stand the reason why now that you understand the difference between a landing page and a sales page
6:30
then you want to ask yourself why do I as a small Business Solutions focused on
6:36
doing my own thing need a landing page so this is the reason first people will
6:42
buy for you from you on to the know you and trust you if they do not know and trust you there
6:48
is no way they are buying from you so a landing page is designed specifically to generate leads you know just think of
6:54
potential customers for your online business or for your offline business for example if you sell cake items
7:03
if you sell cake items you might want to create something Elite generation form that will tell people the best cake to
7:08
use for their wedding imagine that imagine uh you run an advert online that
7:14
tells people these are the 10 top 20 cakes to use for your wedding massive right massive or tough 20 kicks to break
7:21
forward and massive that's some some that's one of the reasons why you need a landing page because it helps you to get
7:27
your attention to your business number two it enables you to optimize
7:33
your conversions so I think these are very these are very complex English but I'm going to you know bring it down when
7:40
I make conversion conversion means making a sale that's what it means it means making a sale so for for a landing
7:47
page it means that you'd have more customers to sell to so it increases
7:52
your potential of making money from your business then again a landing page can increase
7:59
your engagement so a lot of people uh a lot of small businesses have websites
8:04
you know they have tons of websites they have uh traffic coming to that website
8:09
but then they just the people just come there and they do nothing
8:14
they do nothing if you're very few A very wise business owner I will figure
8:21
out a ways you know these persons will come into my website I want them to drop their email I want them to drop their
8:27
phone number I want just do something so that you can get their attention
8:32
increase your engagement and then you can sell to this person or make them an
8:38
offer in the future number five a landing page will enable you to track your results with a landing
8:45
page you can track the health of your business you can track how many persons are buying from you how many persons are
8:51
not buying from you you can track where they are coming from and who is bringing
8:57
them I mean are they coming from your social media handle are they coming from Twitter are they coming from you know
9:02
where exactly are you come are they coming from so you can track your marketing effort one thing that I always
9:09
advise businesses small business solopreneurs one thing that I always
9:14
advise them to do is that for every time you want to create a new product create
9:20
a new landing page for every product you want to create create a new landing page it's something
9:27
I always advise because you will be able to measure each of your marketing effort
9:33
so um that's it go ahead and think about this if you have a landing page before
9:38
now go go ask yourself what exactly do you use your landing page for so it's
9:44
going to be directed to you hey what exactly do I use my landing page for go ahead and check that and answer that
9:50
question for yourself and join me in the next class where I'm going to show you the landing page framework
9:56
we've not stopped talking about this page okay the landing page is just the basics I'm
10:02
going to show you both framework landing page framework and sales pitch framework in the next lesson I'll see you then
10:08
this is the framework that I used to build my entire land a bit you know every landing page that you see me build
10:14
every landing page have launched courses with this is the exact framework that I use and I can tell you it pays and I've
10:21
checked other persons you know I've seen other person's framework it is so similar to this particular framework so
10:28
if I were you I would copy it paste it somewhere close to my PC or paste it on my notice board so I can always remember
10:35
this framework we're gonna go through it together we're going to go through it together
10:41
and I will show you some other sites that using this same framework to sell so the first thing first of all every
10:47
landing page is the headline your headline you want your headline to be benefits based for example if you are
10:55
a gym instructor and you're looking for someone to come to your gym normally you will say lose body fact
11:03
that's an advantage yes but it's not very cool you might say
11:09
get into shape that's that's an advantage but something
11:14
like we make you look beautiful we make you we make you look beautiful
11:20
we help you attract your dream man because the reason why a lady will want to come to the gym yes the lady will
11:25
want to be healthy but lots of people want to be able to get into very healthy relationship that's one of the reasons
11:31
it goes to the gym so you're looking for the benefits you're looking for the benefits so for
11:37
example if you are an XE or a spot and you're trying to create a landing page
11:42
how would you say it you would say I help you turn you say something like turn website
11:48
visitors into customers in 10 days increase your traffic by 100 in five days that's the Ben that's what people
11:55
want increase your conversions in 10 days that's what people basically want they want the resort so if you are
12:01
creating a landing page your headline should be the resort and then after the headline you have the subheading
12:08
you have the subheading the subheading is just supporting the headline that's what it is I'm going to show you a
12:15
headline from another website so you see what I'm talking about so if you look at this agency you will
12:23
see it's an excellent it's called Excel agency and here it says add six figures to your business while working less
12:28
hours by leveraging automation so this agency they help you to automate your business
12:34
then that's the headline then you have on on average we serve Agency on we save agency owners 10 hours per week letting
12:41
you focus on high value activities within your business so you can see
12:46
that they haven't had they're starting with the benefits and the benefit is that hey if you go with us you're going
12:52
to make money that's the benefit if you decided to decide to trade with us you're going to
12:57
make a whole lot of money and then how are you how they helping you make money by Saving you tons of hours
13:04
so I want you I want you to look at this other one look at this other one optimized High
13:09
Landing converting landing pages for digital entrepreneurs optimize High Landing High Landing converting Pages
13:16
for digital entrepreneurs and then you have casually make convert landing pages
13:21
aesthetic functional and turn them into money making machine so what's the benefit hey the first thing first is I'm
13:27
going to create a landing page for you and the second thing you're going to make money with this landing page when I
13:32
create them for you so that's something you want to look at you want to be like what's the benefit of my product and
13:38
what is the result what will I do for you and what's the result
13:44
and once you're good with that the next thing you want to you you might want to add is a video sales letter so the thing
13:50
is that these days human people are watching videos like never before that's
13:55
what people are doing people are watching videos like never before if you look at this guy this guy just you know
14:01
straight up straight up uh headline supporting
14:07
statement and then put a video says later this is the way I like to I like to fix
14:12
my page I like people to I like my audience to get to know me and I like to introduce myself to my audience and so
14:18
they can see what I can do this is very important for you try this and you will really like it introduce yourself to
14:25
your audience make them see what you can do physically and then it just really
14:30
really makes sense to you to them as to you know what you're offering them and how you're offering them that particular
14:36
service very important but you don't really have
14:42
to have a quick match to do this there is a service called Loom l-o-oom just go
14:48
ahead and say I use Loom it's free it's free record yourself you know talking
14:53
about your product or if it's a digital product record yourself talking about it but if it's your physical product just
15:00
take your phone take your friend's phone if your friend have an iPhone a Samsung or any phone in a well-lit environment
15:05
and just talk about your product as ordinary as possible it doesn't have to be something special though if you put
15:12
some creativity to it it will be a lot it will be super good so let's run through this the next thing
15:18
that you want to do so um that's the next thing you want to do is to add social proof
15:23
you know people nobody wants to be the first person to buy from you they want
15:29
to be the second they want to be the third person when they've had other people buy from you and they find success using your product
15:36
so you want to add testimonies of other persons who have bought from you then you want to add benefits what's the
15:43
benefits you're buying from you you know the first time doing in the headline you added benefits and this time you want to
15:48
add plenty benefits what's the benefits of buying from you what are people going to get when they decide to buy from you
15:54
and after that you want to add the process this thing that you're doing how are you
16:00
doing it how are you making it this soup that you're selling how are you making it this bad how are you getting it this
16:08
digital product how are you doing it so this is just allow people to know the underlying process behind your products
16:15
it's not a terrible thing at all it just enables your customer to see through what you're actually doing
16:22
if we go back to these landing pages go back to this landing pages you will see they have a call to action here
16:29
yeah we didn't talk about the contraction I'm not sure we have a contraction here if you see this guy this person have a call to action which
16:35
is book a call one thing that I want you to understand about the call to action is this
16:40
don't tell people click here please don't tell people click here
16:45
don't tell people um let us chart no tell people what you want them to do if you want them to sign
16:52
up for a free try and say sign up for seven day free trial if you want them to order for the product order the product
16:59
now make it an action word what you want them to do if you look at all this if
17:04
you look at this guy book a call that's an action word I'm looking free calls that's an action
17:10
word you really want them to say hey this is what I've come here to do and that's what I'm gonna do and here you
17:15
can see this person has a testimony testimony testimony and then there's
17:20
another call to action here and then there is what we do can you see it there is what we do
17:28
and then there is another call to action so this same person testimonies
17:34
about me yeah there's a chance to put about me but I personally I would love to put it further down so when I tell
17:41
you about process you can see the process they all make an offer Outreach combat
17:46
that's a process so this is this also is a process 90-day timeline
17:53
so what you want to do you just want to add process you just want to add all this sauce to your page to make it make
18:00
sense and then you also want to add what they will get this is very important if I buy your
18:06
course what am I going to get if I buy from you what am I going to get what are you going to give me if you know you're
18:12
going to give this person maybe an ebook a video list it out this is what you're
18:17
going to get if it's a course at least all the topics that you're going to get when they make payment to you
18:24
then also you want to add a seat you want to add more CTX so after each you
18:29
know feature you can add CTA that's fine you want to add about yourself that's a very cool thing you want to add more
18:35
social proofs and FAQ this part about FAQ it's very important people have
18:41
objections and people I want to ask you questions questions might be why are you pricing
18:49
the way you do where do you deliver to where are you located how do I refund how do I reach you these are basic
18:56
questions so you want to answer those questions for yourself and then there is a CTA again and then privacy policy if
19:04
you're selling items that have contains very sensitive information if you're selling items that might Bridge the
19:10
right of other people if you're selling things like plus 18 you know anything that has to do with plus 18 you're
19:17
selling things that have to do with things that are alcoholic not for teenagers please put privacy policies
19:23
and include terms and conditions they're very very very important so that's it that's the landing page framework go
19:31
ahead and you know think about it if you have if you're watching this with a friend discuss it with your friend
19:36
and then we'll again go ahead and see the sales page framework that um it's
19:42
very important that you understand the spiritual path before you go ahead and start building your landing pages
19:49
meanwhile I really don't want you to refund the money so I have to give you um I have to give you a good
19:57
I have to give you a good course you know I have to give you good information so that said
20:03
before six pages it is very similar to landing pages just that you talk more stories it's just just imagine you you
20:12
want to collect the person's email like you want to sell the person in the car or an iPhone 14 pro Max
20:17
they talk the convincing will be different one is so easy just drop your email for me and
20:24
the other one the one the first one is so easy drop your email book a call that's so easy the person is not making
20:29
any Financial commitment but for this one you want the person to make Financial commitment immediately
20:36
so what's very important in six pages it's majorly the offer
20:41
the offer itself is very very important the offer and the
20:47
and testimonies basically two things are really really really really really really
20:52
stand out for me so you can see from here that you have the value provide how you create a value
20:58
visualize it which it pictures social proofs CTA features and objections bring your offer
21:06
to life using social proof FAQ CTA and found this note all the scenes are very they are similar
21:13
to what you would have on your landing pages but this time you have to really do a lot of convincing this is where
21:19
your copywriting has to be on has to be on point you have to write your sales
21:25
page like you're seeing the person like you're talking to the person right there and there that's how you'll do it if
21:31
you're just doing it like a like you're just thinking about it from your head no
21:36
it doesn't make sense so it's because that you if you want to write this page very well just go to an email shop and
21:44
see the way he convinces you okay if you're watching this in Nigeria evil people are very amazing people that
21:51
know how to sell very well just go to your favorite person the person who sells to you that favorite person
21:56
whatever City you're watching this go there and just observe try to buy
22:02
something and you know try to buy something and act like you're not buying try to put some objections try to put
22:09
some restraint create resistance for the other person and see how the person relate to you
22:14
especially if you know that this person is a very cool sales person if you notice the person will tell you
22:20
so many things they will tell you about how one person bought this particular product and the person has been using it for 10 years how one other person bought
22:27
this body Club product and the person has been using it for 15 years how somebody bought the product and the
22:32
person came back again and said thank you how they're going to give you a warranty like hey bro if you buy this
22:39
product six times you buy this product and it's not working in 30 days bring it back for me in one year if it does not
22:46
work bring it back for me if you buy a refrigerator and in one year it's still not working bring the refrigerator for
22:53
me uh sometimes they would say you see this particular thing this particular Appliance we just have two left what's
23:01
the person trying to do scarcity the person who's trying to tell you hey come back three months you still be if it's
23:08
not if it stops or you can bring it back forwards it's trying to provide to you a warranty
23:13
that's easiest way to learn to learn writing this copy go to your favorite person who markets in a local shop and
23:20
listen to what the person says then transform that into writing for your business and trust me you would sell a
23:25
whole lot but don't forget you can also if you don't have time to go out you can also follow this framework and it will
23:32
make a whole lot of sense to you let me show you a few sites that follows this framework
23:39
so this is uh so this is it this is somebody who's selling baking
23:44
masterclass master class for baking so you can see stop fighting fools the master class
23:50
this is just a picture and then the person goes is this you
23:55
this is the story this storytelling so the person is trying to cry he's personally just trying to get your attention
24:01
so the person keeps going keeps going you know keeps going
24:06
keeps going you're not alone and these are testimonials so you see what I'm saying these are testimonials these are
24:12
testimonials lots of testimonials I wasn't even giving you a click to get more testimonials
24:18
and then you see what you're going to get when you choose the Mastercards and
24:24
then you see more objections you see more objections the person is trying to you know get your attention more
24:30
and then you see what you're going to get this is core mode is where you're going to get keep
24:37
going keep going this is what you're going to get and then you see what people are saying these are more testimonials
24:44
so if you look at it any page that I want people to buy immediately has tons
24:50
and tons of testimonials people read the copy yes what people focus on the testimonials way more because they know
24:57
they're going to be putting in their card right there so you also have this one DIY baking
25:03
website so this is very minimal and then you have you have
25:09
um what you're currently going through is this you then now this is the way the person is
25:14
going to help you and then you scoot down and you're seeing what you get
25:22
and then now you're seeing yeah what you get what you get your instructor course curriculum frequency ad question I think
25:29
the only thing that this person doesn't have is testimonials that's the only thing this
25:35
person doesn't have and I think if she adds testimoniality or it is going to be excellent
25:41
and then you have this one you can see the name of the instructor or what you're going to get this is a
25:47
fashion illustration drawing drawing course and then you have
25:53
if you screw down if I scroll down like this you can see what you're going to get about the instructor cost curriculum
26:00
and a whole lot more so majorly that's the same sequence that almost every
26:05
sales page will follow follow it and you're going to make more money for
26:10
yourself so that's it that's it that's what it says Pages that's what the landing pages
26:16
so next I'm going to introduce you to the tool that we're going to be using to design the landing page and also I'm
26:21
going to introduce the constant line so it doesn't get so boring for you so to join me next you know we'll get a cup of
26:28
coffee give somebody a warm hug you know stand up stretch and then you come back and join me for the next lesson I'll see
26:36
you then you see the way I create my coaches I like it to be very detailed
26:41
the reason why I like it to be very detailed is because I want you to watch just this course and take action
26:47
because if you watch this course and watch the other one watch the other one because it's not complete so you won't
26:53
be able to take action at the end of the day so I'm this is the framework that we're
26:59
going to go through it's pretty long yes it's pretty long and you might be saying
27:04
hey Paul this course is too affordable it's fine all I want you to do is to
27:10
learn it I'm taking hours upon hours to create this but I really want a lot of business people to be able to
27:16
to be able to sell more spend less and make more money so they can live the life they really want to leave yeah I'm
27:23
a Christian by the way it's beautiful so this is the landing page outline so I
27:29
will get you introduced to the page builder that we're going to be using then we will Design or try to design a
27:35
landing page customizing it we'll talk about colors typography speed refine your landing page we will
27:43
talk about social proof craft instructor strong call to action
27:50
integrating payment like stripe and pay stack so if you are in an if you're in
27:55
Africa then you can use stripe if you're in Nigeria you can use stripe but if you're using any other payment Gateway
28:00
it's going to be very very similar for you then we'll talk about in athletics we'll talk about analytics or
28:07
then personalize our landing page just like that so it's going to be it's not going to be
28:15
this straightforward like it's not going to be like a four minutes cost so I think you should really be ready to
28:20
learn a whole lot it's not going to be a fun man it's classy but we're just going to go one step at a time and so if you
28:26
have questions regarding any of this you'll irrespective of the platform where you're watching this you will see

29:02
introduce you to the tool that we're going to use to build this landing page
29:07
so the tool that we're using is called Elementor uh Joe it's it don't it's Elementor
29:14
itself is a it's a drag and drop tool for creating a website so anyone can use it you really did not need any
29:21
experience to use Elementor to create a website as you can see right here it's super straightforward I wouldn't say
29:28
it's the most easy tool in the world but it is super straightforward you can use it to create anything landing pages
29:35
online store blog and the rest but this time will focusing on creating sales
29:40
pages and landing pages using Elementor so it is
29:47
um you can like I said it is responsive that means it works on both mobile and
29:53
desktop it is very responsive they have a very good community and it's pretty affordable
29:59
if you go back to the pricing you will see that um if you go to the pricing you will see
30:04
that it is around 49 US dollars to actually grab this yeah it's around 49
30:10
US dollars to grab this I'm wondering why it's not um so I'm gonna just reload
30:19
okay I think they're having issues so I'm just going to say slash pricing
30:25
okay so you will see it's 99 a year for you to for you to use your WordPress
30:31
hosting but that's not what we're using well just you you're gonna use the Elementor itself so the Elementor itself
30:37
it's 49 US dollars per year that's how much you'll pay for the Elementor but
30:43
since you're taking this course and your best friend now you're gonna get it for free you're gonna get it for free there will
30:50
be if you're watching this on YouTube there will be a link below if you if you bought the course speed I mean you're
30:55
watching it somewhere else you will see a folder that will contain Elementor so
31:00
just click on it and you'll be able to unzip it and you'll be able to use it on your website
31:07
I guess you could you could give me a high five for that right you're getting 45 for free and that's cool so that's
31:13
what we're going to be using for viewing that website and then for hosting our
31:18
website we're going to use the service called namechip so the reason why I do advise you to use
31:24
namecheap is because it's very affordable for solopreneurs you really want to figure find something that is
31:30
very affordable but yet very effective name chip in itself it's very affordable
31:35
you can see let's see how much this will cost you can see for Stella you're just
31:41
paying 1.98 let's say on the average two dollars a month for for Stellar plus if you need more
31:47
speed and more domain name you're paying just two dollars three dollars a month
31:52
that's what you're paying to get is up to speed I know I just I'm saying a couple of things that are very new like
31:58
domain name and hosting so let me tell you what domain name is for example if I'm coming to your house
32:05
if I'm coming to your house you're going to say hey Paul come to
32:11
Montgomery number 995 Montgomery Street yeah come to number 20 Lillian Avenue
32:20
so what you're doing is that you're telling me a place in a city that's where you want me to come if I take that
32:27
place and put it on Google Map I will be able to find your house similarly to what my name is domain name is just a
32:33
place an address that says this is where your website is located
32:39
then when it comes to your host host is like the house itself domain name is the
32:45
address of your house then the host is the house itself remember it's your house that contains your bed your
32:50
furniture your cushions and the rest same thing your host is your host is like a big memory card on the internet
32:57
where you can store your website images pictures videos and any other thing that
33:02
you have in there so that's basically what your host is don't let it confuse you if you know how
33:08
to use your memory card then you know how to use the hosting address it is that simple don't let it confuse you a horse is like
33:16
a big memory card in the internet that you can store your website files and you can retrieve them whenever you need them
33:22
so why why you're still here go ahead and click on go ahead and register for namecheap so
33:30
you will just you know sign in um you just go ahead and sign in so how you
33:35
were doing it's um so I'm gonna go ahead and sign off right there so how you do it is uh you will
33:41
just click on the sign up and you would enter all your details just like when you sign up on any
33:47
Services you know enter your details and then um to just click on sign up do this and
33:53
come back and I'll show you how to purchase a domain name and a host on namechip thank you
34:01
so I hope you were able to create your account here if you weren't able to do it just go ahead and try again you need
34:07
a username that is unique you need the password confirm your password full name first name last name and the email
34:14
address that's what you need and then you click on the login so I have those already I'm just gonna click
34:21
on I'm just gonna go login when you open your account and you're trying to log in it may ask you to your
34:28
entire verification code you just go to the email that you open your account with and you'll get it there
34:34
so now when you log in you will see a dashboard like this and the next thing that you want to do is to click on the
34:39
domain and say domain name search this is where you would put name the
34:45
name so this is the way it is these things work your domain name doesn't have to be your name doesn't have to be
34:51
your business name it can be the product name for example if I'm teaching people how to create fashion stitches I could
34:57
say fashion stitches fashion Stitch School
35:04
Stitch school.com I could say I could just pull
35:11
that and figure out if it's there don't spend too much time trying to choose a germanium just try to think about the
35:17
name of the product that you want to create and just buy something that fits you can see this version Stitch school
35:23
that I just thought about in my head it's available don't think it too much because the more you think the more you
35:28
delay the more you delay the less money you'll make don't think about it too much just create it and that's all you
35:34
have to do and also you can you can buy many domain name for
35:41
as many products you want to launch for each product you believe you launch you buy a new domain name for HBO to launch
35:46
you just buy a new domain name because you can launch a product and you like it you just want to leave it there not
35:52
every product have to be under your name my name is Paul okudua for instance I have a product called porno called it's
35:58
a service company and the way you bought this particular one is a different it's a different domain in mentality so don't
36:04
make it very very restricting for yourself and so once you do this you're going to
36:10
go ahead and add it to cart that's the first thing you do you add it to cut and once you added the cards the next thing
36:16
you do is to purchase a hosting purchase a web hosting so you can purchase it from here like so just click on it
36:23
you can purchase it from here or you can go in here and click on hosting click on hosting and figure out the plan
36:30
that works for you so you have this Stellar hosting you have the Stellar business hosting yeah
36:36
it just you know it just works every time so you can click on it and you can purchase one of those
36:43
this is the hosting you want to click shared hosting that's the one you want to buy this one it is way cheaper for
36:49
you to for you to purchase you know purchase with this so you can say get started just click on it and that particular
36:55
hosting will be added to your account so you would say add to cart that's what you would say add to a new domain yeah
37:09
so this supposed to be added to a new domain and um
37:16
add it to a new domain and uh it's supposed to work
37:30
okay this is not working like the way I wanted to but um so I'm gonna consider
37:35
the purchase go back here view cart and I'm going to remove this
37:45
so I'm going to remove this so we can try again I'll go back to namecheap click on hosting shared hosting click on
37:52
the get started which is Stella hosting then I would say how to cut
37:58
so when I say add to cart when I say add to cart you will see this part where it
38:03
says promo this is this is another opportunity for you to you know get something off your
38:09
order so instead of paying 32 dollars you'll pay less more so that's why
38:15
when you're doing this I would like it if you use um the Microsoft edge browser because it helps you to find coupon
38:21
so one thing that you see is that it will help you to search for coupons and this coupon says just save the four
38:29
dollar 88 Cent but really you don't want to check out like this you can just you know
38:36
forget about it don't check out like this instead refresh
38:41
refresh remove the coupon and figure out remove the coupon and
38:47
just um so you would refresh remove the coupon and then you would go ahead and
38:54
you know click you know just click on these coupons like this and
39:00
you'll find the coupon you will see some of this coupon they are removing you will see your balance change you see the
39:05
balance change like so just figure out the one that that reduces it the most and then you can
39:13
um you can actually apply that particular coupon on your on your page and you can
39:20
also click on the side here should cancel you can click on the side here you can say we find 20 off
39:27
so you can just try most of this coupon like copy this one this is going to save you 50 50 percent [Music]
39:33
so this is going to save you 50 say apply and let's see what's gonna happen
39:41
so just apply this to you so now it's applying the coupon
39:47
it's so you could get lots of uh you know lots of things off your order when you try to do it like this and then you
39:54
can also go to the internet and find coupon for yourself that's just another way for you to save
39:59
a couple of bucks before you check out so once you're done with that you'll go
40:04
ahead and confirm order after confirming order you would enter your gun details and then you make payment
40:12
so but if you are in Nigeria and you're trying to buy from you're trying to buy
40:18
from here if you're from America this is going to work seamlessly but if you are in
40:24
Nigerian what you'll do is you will go to you go get a card from somewhere so you
40:30
can get a card from this website called geekpay foreign you can get a card from here they can
40:36
give you you know a card for you to for you to use to make this payment so you
40:42
can get a card from here or you can use your maybe Banks like fcmb card GT pay
40:48
you can use your domiciliary account if you want to because there's some restrictions there's restrictions and
40:54
cards that you that you that you can use here and also
41:00
another way to make this payment is also use the Bitcoin so you can use Bitcoin
41:05
from binance to make this payment if you want to Super straightforward so that's
41:11
basically it if you still have you're still having trouble making this payment feel free to send me your email or reach me on WhatsApp on Twitter
41:18
and you'll be able to and I'll be able to you know help you find specific cards but if you're not from Nigeria you're
41:23
from places Africa or Ghana um it works seamlessly but this is just
41:28
basically the reason why it doesn't work for Nigeria seamlessly is just because of um Central Bank policies that has
41:34
been implemented on our cards here so that's it go ahead and purchase your domain name on your hosting and then you
41:41
join me in the next lesson I'll see you then once you're able to log in or once
41:48
you're able to make payments and register you will get a couple of emails like this you'll get a couple of emails
41:54
says welcome to namecheap and then you will get to this immediate verification required
42:01
so what you will do is that you would just click on this registration agreement and that's all you have to do just
42:08
confirm this and that's all you have to do this is just going to make sure that your your website doesn't get
42:13
blacklisted or anything in the future so once you're done with that you come back to your your page here you're
42:20
hosting your landing page here and you click on hosting hosting list
42:27
is where you click and then go to cpanel so what you see might scare you a little
42:33
bit but really you don't need to be scared because you're not going to be using the entire sleep on it you really
42:39
don't need to be scared all you have to do is to follow a few instructions on your good you don't have
42:45
to be scared because of the interface there are two things that you'll be doing here one of them is the name chip
42:50
XSL which is um which is a security secure security layer
42:56
this and then spectacular installer and then that's that's an email
43:03
so all these are pretty straightforward so don't think think of it too much over and complicated
43:09
first thing first is to go to the namecheap XSL so you can see what else it does for you is that it helps you to
43:15
protect your website so it's an end-to-end encryption so you can see
43:20
this key here this is a key you can see this key here
43:25
connection to this site is secure you can see this key it's secure so what you're looking for you want to add that
43:31
key to your own personal website so that you'd be secure for you also so you will say ready to install install
43:37
via Excel installed so you will see you you see
43:43
the sprinkler one is actually active so you can add more XSL to this you will
43:48
see this particular one is already active but you will see it here when when you come here you will see your
43:54
domain name and you just tell you install but if you're finding very difficult to do this what I'll advise you to do is to
44:01
go to your dashboard and say live chart when you click on the live chart you'll be able to speak to an agent so you just
44:08
click on this you're able to speak to an agent and tell them say hey I want you to install XSL for me so if it's XSL that is your
44:15
trouble click on the XSL here and say hey I really want you to install Excel for me they are very responsive that's
44:21
one reason why I asked you to register here on namecheap because you're very responsive to queries
44:28
so once you install that the next thing you come around to do is to you know create your email address
44:33
so to do that say email this is very important for you but this is just a web mail but really you can
44:41
create any other type of email that you want to create you can use Google Mail you can use any of that email it's fine
44:47
it's all right it's more accessible if you want very beautiful interface like this you can
44:52
use Google email it's nine dollar a month for Google email but if you don't if you can't afford
44:57
neither like months I would definitely advise that you just go ahead and create an email so just go ahead and say create
45:03
here pull the username of the email pull the password and say create just the same way you would create any other
45:09
email address and when you do so you'll be able to check it so you will just say
45:14
let's just say demo let's put the name of this username and say demo let's put
45:20
the generate password this password you have to keep it though you can always change it when you come back when you
45:25
come back to the dashboard yeah then you say create once you do this you can see how easy it
45:31
is that's the only thing you have to do then you could go and say check email that's all
45:37
check email is to it's so similar to your Gmail that you wouldn't even believe it's really similar to your
45:43
Gmail you see your inbox you see your you see your sent item so go ahead and say open you see your inbox send items
45:50
and you're able to do everything here
45:56
so you can see that we have inbox we have draft we have sent we have junk we have tracked and we have archives that's
46:03
it you want to create an email you want to send an email to somebody click on compose and when you click on compose
46:09
just like any other email service you will be able to create emails just
46:14
simply by clicking on that so you can see compose to who subject email click on send and there's something else I
46:20
really want you to see if I go back again I will say check email you can follow the deal of time that for
46:28
an entrepreneur you would not be you would you wouldn't want to be coming here all the time you want to use one single email which is your Gmail so you
46:35
go ahead and say folder and then you add the folder so the folder here you just put in your
46:42
personal email address like for example this is my personal email address and
46:47
I'll just go ahead and add this and I'll say add forward so the way you're doing this is any email that comes here will
46:53
just automatically be forwarded to your Gmail account so you don't miss any email when people try to contact you
47:00
and another thing that you can do also you can also add an autoresponder so what an autoresponder is is I'm just
47:07
telling people hey I got your email I really am really going to get back to you in the future so this is an
47:13
autoresponder click on it just say I got your email and I'm going to get back to
47:18
you in the future so I had an autoresponder and say interval how many hours after
47:26
maybe five hours after sending an email it's gonna be from who subject the body
47:31
and send so this is just going to send it immediately so if your accept the
47:36
office see it's going to send it it's going to send it to the person hey Paul is going to get back to you so you can be immediately similar I send a mail to
47:43
you you want to send me back I can also responder saying hey Paul I'm gonna get back to you as soon as possible
47:50
so that's why you can do that and also there's there's sometimes where you want to create something called a sub demand
47:55
so your domain is like www.paulnocool.com by soap demand is like www dot
48:05
courses.paulnocode.com you see the same thing with porno code
48:10
just that it's a sub it's it's something is an address that I can give to other persons and I can do whatsoever I want
48:16
with that particular address for example uh you can see the address here is google.com right and then the
48:24
sub address is mail.google.com you can see right you can see this one the address here is
48:31
teachable.com and the server address is kissing color.tgbowl.com so if you want to
48:38
create something like that what you can do is to say is just click here and say add on just just type the word add a d
48:45
click on add-on domain click on add-in domain and then you will
48:50
just call it whatever you want to call it so if yours is course so I'm going to call my course
48:57
like so and I'm gonna say um create
49:02
so this is not valued why foreign
49:10
oh sorry it's not supposed to be an add-on domain supposed to be a sub domain sub demand that's where it is
49:16
forgive me it's a supplement so um this male is a supplement this is the
49:22
main domain which is the domain itself and this is the sub so anything that is under is called a sub so it says create
49:28
the sub domain I'll just call it courses or let's just call it a landing page
49:35
.com so we'll say create
49:45
it's going to take a little while for you to do this so this will also give me an opportunity to go show you how to install an SSS
49:52
certificate like this on this particular sub domain so whatever an add-on domain
49:58
can do a sub domain can do it it's just that the name is not straightforward whatever an add-on whatever is an add-on
50:04
domain can do a supplement can really really do it so you can see it's been created and you can see now it's telling
50:11
me enable positive essay certificate for this guy so I'm just going to click on post
50:16
device as well okay this is telling me to buy I don't
50:23
want to buy anything so come back here go back here and I will click on
50:28
namecheap SSL because I don't want to pay for anything so that's the thing about being a
50:35
business you're looking for a way to not pay for anything so I'm just going to say reconnect
50:43
and start via namecheap
50:48
so you can see that we have this other one and landing page blah blah blah landing page dot this the domain
50:54
name.com in progress and it's pending that's how yours is going to be and one thing I see why I love why I told you I
51:01
love namecheap it gives you 50 SSS certificate and this is application you're supposed to buy like five dollar
51:07
per one but it's giving you 50 for free so it's gonna be pending and hopefully when we come back when you come back
51:13
from the next lesson I'm going to show you that this pending has done to active once you do this we'll go ahead and
51:18
learn how to install WordPress so I didn't tell you about what price before so Elementor runs on top of what
51:25
price I'm going to explain to you what WordPress is when we come back to this course just go ahead and install your
51:32
access certificate and enjoy me in the next lesson thank you
51:38
part of the tutorial we want to keep on exploring the C panel and I want to show
51:43
you what WordPress is you know like I said before your your website is going to be built on top of
51:49
Wordpress WordPress in itself it's an open source so we mean open source mean it's free anybody can use it anyone and
51:56
anyone Inc everyone including you you can use WordPress to build almost anything you can use your
52:02
build e-commerce store blog landing pages sales Pages real estate application anything you want to be
52:08
builded with what it means is that you can modify it freely to do anything that you wanted to to do
52:15
so in order for us to to do this we're going to install we're going to use this subtacular install it's just over here
52:22
if you you can't find it here just come to the search and just type the word soft type the word stuffed soft and come back
52:29
here click on it and when you click on it you'll be able to access this
52:34
installer so here you're going to say install so you see this place where it said in store WordPress you can see
52:41
there are tons of other applications that you can install with subtitles but the choice application for us it's
52:46
WordPress so we'll click on it where it says install and here you will choose the
52:52
domain where you want to install it so I'm going to install it here but you can choose you choose the domain name but
52:58
make sure that you have this https and this that's what you're choosing you're choosing this https protocol this means
53:05
that it's just you know very very secure and in yours you might see a in
53:10
directory you might see WP here but so when you see WP just swipe it up and
53:16
make sure that this WP here is empty and when you come back here you can write the name of your site so I'll say
53:22
landing page you can type the description best landing page
53:27
then you can add the username username can be your name so my name is Paul knuckle I'm going to say that to my
53:33
username and the password itself you can leave it that way but just go ahead and copy it and paste it somewhere you know
53:39
like go to your notes and create something create a new notes and just paste it here so you can always remember
53:47
remember remember you take your username is not it's something that you can't remember also copy your username and
53:52
paste it there for your admin email you can change it to your Gmail if you want to or you can change it to that email that
54:00
you created in the in the super nail earlier select your language my language is
54:06
English so that's what I'm going to use backups you can always determine how many times your site should be backed up
54:13
here I'm saying that you can click just back up and it's going to back it up daily weekly but don't worry don't worry
54:21
about don't bother selecting this particular plugin it's fine because you
54:26
can do that you can your your hosting plan will do that for you automatically we'll do that
54:31
for you by itself and um you can see here where it says backup
54:36
so you have once in a day once in a week once in a month so I'm going to say once in a week so this will just ensure that
54:43
your site gets your your your sites if anything
54:48
happens you can go back and roll to the previous backup that you're using before and here when it says rotation backup
54:56
partition you can click here to see um you can click here to see if you click
55:01
on this on this button you would see what it means by all of the Sims so what it means right backup rotation is how
55:08
many of these copies should it keep before deleting the old one so here it's going to keep it's going to keep four
55:14
copies so if you're every time it gets to four it will delete the old one every time it gets to four it will delete the
55:19
order so if it gets to one two three four if you delete number five starting from the bottom not starting from the
55:26
new starting from the old number five that's how it's going to do it so if you're comfortable with that you just go ahead and say install
55:32
uh you wait for a few seconds just for a few seconds it's going to
55:39
install just like that
55:49
so now if you tell you hey congratulations it has been installed successfully that's what to tell you and
55:54
once you're good you will see two URL this is a site URL if you click it it's going to open the site itself
56:00
yeah so you can see this is the site itself and then when you click the other URL
56:07

I'll just paste it and login so it's same thing you're still going to log in to the dashboard and accomplish the same
56:58
thing just like you did before and if you are able to do this a big round of applause to you you deserve you know in
57:05
a word right there that you are able to come in here and install WordPress and
57:10
you're good so like I said again this is your website and this is your admin dashboard
57:16
this is where you make all the customizations this is where you build landing pages that are these beautiful that are this beautiful and this is
57:24
where you this is the link that you share to your friends family and everyone who wants to know about your
57:30
business so I hope you got it so to recap you would go to your cpanel you would choose
57:37
spectacular loss and store your WordPress and then you would after installing it you'll come back here and
57:43
start customizing your site so let's talk about WordPress so like I said before WordPress is open
57:49
source everybody can use it so yeah there are a few things that you should
57:54
consign yourself with consign yourself with plugin settings and post that's where you should consign yourself with
58:00
plugins settings Pages yeah concern
58:06
yourself with all that and the others are just you know really secondary because you're going to be working there
58:11
Pages this is how things just just this is how WordPress represents a web web
58:16
page in your website for example this is a page this is a page this is a page
58:23
that's what you're sharing you're just sharing Pages if I come back to this website um
58:29
so I'm going to go to a pretty complex website um
58:35
so let's come back to Wordpress the elemental website you would see that this is this this has a lot of pages
58:41
pricing is a page login is a page getting started is a page so similar
58:47
thing if you want to you can create multiple pages on your website but for the landing pages there are always one Pages sales pages are almost one Pages
58:53
all the time so you need not to worry about creating multiple pages with your website so if I click on pages
59:01
I can see the page that I currently have and then I can add a new page to add a new page I simply just add new
59:07
and give it a name so add a new page say click on new give you the name and
59:13
that's what I have to do so it's it's a bit slow it's gonna be
59:20
faster depending on your network speed if your network is really fast then it's going to be fast so all I have to do
59:26
here is to give it a pitch title and say about and just click publish publish
59:32
so when I come it's telling you hey about it's not life and when I come back here and I just refresh I will see the
59:41
about page you can see the about page if I click on it it's going to go to another page and if you take a look at
59:46
the URL it's going to say hey your website slash about you can see about so
59:52
that's how you work with pages so let's go back to looking at plugins
59:57
plugins are tools or there are scripts that add additional functionalities to
1:00:03
your application for example we're going to be working with with Elementor right Elementor in itself is a plug-in that's
1:00:09
what it is it just enables WordPress to do so many things normally what price was created for you to blog with but
1:00:16
once the idea of creating plugins starts coming it enables you and anyone else to
1:00:21
extend WordPress to in such a way that you could almost build anything for example if you want to build an
1:00:27
e-commerce website you would install this WordPress this plugin called woocommerce
1:00:35
you install this plugin called woocommerce and once you do so you will be able to
1:00:42
create you will be able to create online store just using this plugin called
1:00:48
woocommerce so that's how you would that's how you would do it then the settings if you come back to the
1:00:53
settings you can see this is where we can cite our site tagline our site name and this
1:00:59
is where we can say our site language and this is how where we can set our time so if my time here is plus one GMT
1:01:07
or plus one UTC that's fine and then you can set your date format and once you're comfortable with that you say save
1:01:13
changes and we will talk about reading panel links so this is very important too
1:01:19
permanent links you say day and name this is not the best thing to do the best thing to do is to say use the post
1:01:25
name so click on the post name and say save changes so all of the things like the theme is
1:01:31
not really going to matter but those are the few things that really matters as we are building this landing page so that's
1:01:37
it go ahead and install WordPress and join me in the next class when I'm going to show you how to install the Elementor
1:01:42
plugin and we'll start building landing pages with WordPress thank you I'll see you in the next lesson not that you've
1:01:49
been able to install to install WordPress on your on your cpanel it's time for us to
1:01:56
install Elementor to install Elementor you would go to login remember I told
1:02:01
you the Elementor itself it's a plugin oh better still before we install Elemento let's go to appearance and
1:02:08
click on teams so I didn't get to explain this so teams it just help your
1:02:14
your your app with styling with style so you can decide not to use a team at all
1:02:20
you can decide to use a team so it's just you can decide to use the team that comes with what price but you can
1:02:26
install and decide to pay um probably pay for a team or chase it but I would
1:02:31
say that for this course you really don't have to purchase a team because it can be a bit complex for you to edit them
1:02:37
so you can see that you can switch from one team to another it just determines the structure and layout of your
1:02:43
application if you're not really if you don't really want to build anything that's where team does so for you to
1:02:49
I really want you to install a new team so click on add new um this thing you'll not really see any
1:02:55
effect when you install it so the theme itself is hello team like this
1:03:01
it's the hello team uh Elemento okay it's not coming up so
1:03:08
just type Elementor so that's the team I really want you to install so the reason why this team I
1:03:14
like this Elementor team is because it is very very very um it's a very lean theme so it loads
1:03:22
very fast and it's only a few kilobytes so if you're using it on your application
1:03:27
you're really not going to find it very difficult your application will not be very slow instead it will be
1:03:34
very very very very fast so you should see yes you could you should see this one
1:03:40
which is the Elementor plugin and then you click install yeah like like I always say it will take
1:03:46
a while to install depending on your internet speed and click on activate
1:03:52
and so once you click on activate you can go back to your to your website click on just reload your page you
1:03:58
should see that the structure will change so that's why I'm saying that the reason why you use template you use team
1:04:04
is just because of your structure so this is a very minimal theme it doesn't come with a lot of structure it's from
1:04:09
Elementor itself and so you can just use it so you won't see any you know change
1:04:14
if you decide to use it like if you decide to go to about now slash amount you wouldn't see any change on your page
1:04:21
so it's just it's just there see once you're done with this it's now time for you to you know do a walk
1:04:27
around just do a walk around as to what to to do a walk around the team and also install Elementor itself like I said to
1:04:34
you Elemento is just a plug-in so click on the plugin and say add new
1:04:40
you will find this Elemental plugin on your on the on the folder
1:04:46
or you'll find it in a link if you're watching it on if you're watching it somewhere interest me the way you're watching it you always find it in a in a
1:04:53
link so I would definitely attach it to this course if you're buying it as some sort of a bundle so remember I told you
1:04:59
that Elementor in itself you would buy Elementor for for each sum of money say
1:05:05
49 US Dollars that's how much Elementor would cost you um so I think we'll find the price here
1:05:12
um if we click on pricing we should find it here so I think there's something wrong with
1:05:18
the with the Elementor website but Elementary in itself to get Elementor is
1:05:23
49 US Dollars that's how much it is to get Elemento for 49 US dollars so I I
1:05:29
think there's something wrong with it maybe they need to you know fix their their web page that's the reason why
1:05:35
you're not seeing the price so if you click on get started it should take you to
1:05:42
it should take you to you know you'll just be able to get started using Elementor but that's how that's how how
1:05:48
it is so I'm giving you this 49 for free and the way you do it is that you go ahead and say upload plugin click on
1:05:54
choose file and then you would go to the plot where you have the course so the
1:06:00
folder where you download the cost to or the folder you know if this is a glue Drive same thing you would have to
1:06:05
download it to your PC first before using it then you come back here and you just extract so you come back here and
1:06:12
you extract the file um so this is a ZIP file but first of
1:06:17
all let's go back go into our PC because I want to extract the file so I'll come
1:06:22
back here and extract it first open with uh if you're if you're on Windows you're going to you know just open it with
1:06:28
unzip and then I'll click on it and this is what I want to do I want to install this to one and two differently not same
1:06:37
way so I'll go back to my I'll go back to Wordpress and I'll say
1:06:42
choose file and I'll go back to the folder and I install the free version
1:06:47
First a free version see install now
1:06:53
so after installing after installing the free version I'll then go ahead and install the pro version so Elementor has
1:07:00
two version the free yes you can do a lot with the free but there are some things that you want to do with it that
1:07:06
you want to do that you will need the pro version to actually finish so while we're waiting for you to
1:07:12
install I'll just bring you up to speed so one thing that I will emphasize is that don't be scared of making mistake
1:07:19
as you get on your journey designing your landing pages with Elementor because you are going to make mistakes
1:07:26
like it or not because this is something that is new to you and you want to try
1:07:32
to do it the best way you can and also nothing I would say is don't give so much attention to the design that you
1:07:38
forget the aim of your designing the landing page the aim of joining the landing page is to sell as much as
1:07:44
possible the name of designer landing page is to get more leads into your business as
1:07:49
fast as possible so you can make more sales and so you can make more money so don't let Aesthetics come in between
1:07:55
coming between you making more money and you trying to make your cut and trying to feel that your website is the best
1:08:01
out there it's almost never going to be the best just do something that really communicate well with your customers and
1:08:08
it's something that you are enjoy something that you think is good and you then go ahead and launch it as fast as
1:08:13
possible so once you're done with installing the plugin go ahead and click on activate so every time you launch something you
1:08:20
always want to activate it even when you change your team you will definitely want to activate that team
1:08:26
so once you've succeeded in installing Elementor you will see a page like this but you don't have to just go ahead and
1:08:32
close it so it takes you back to Elementor so it takes you back the next thing you
1:08:38
want to do go back again to plugin add new plugin and this time you want to install the
1:08:45
pro version the pro version will tell you how to what will enable you to
1:08:52
access the pro features of Elementor so click on the Play upload plugin clip on click on choose and click on the pro
1:09:00
just click on and say install so this should take you a while same
1:09:06
thing take you a while say maybe a minute or two depending on how fast your your network is
1:09:11
so now that you've installed it go ahead and click on activate so that's how to install the elemental
1:09:17
plugin the Elementor and the Elementor Pro plugin so go ahead and do that and next we're going to come back and we'll
1:09:24
briefly explore the Elementor dashboard because that's that's the tool that you're going to use to build your
1:09:30
landing page on your sales page conversations on installing Elementor and conversation on installing
1:09:38
Elementor Pro so if you're still having difficulties trying to install it go back again Watch the video and you'll be
1:09:43
able to do it yourself so let's familiarize ourselves with the elemental page builder
1:09:50
like I said just be very patient go to all pages yeah go to all pages and then
1:09:55
click on add new page so this is not going to be the home page this is just going to be
1:10:01
some sort of a practice we're going to be modeling one of the pages that we see there so let's just call this Praxis
1:10:07
and say edit with Elementor if you don't see this in your page all you have to do is to refresh it several times and you
1:10:15
should see it or you switch your browser so I'm using uh the Microsoft Edge if you're using other browsers and you're
1:10:21
not saying that just change your browser and I'm pretty sure that you'll see it and if you're using a low grade system
1:10:26
it might take a while for this to load and it might tell you load on safe mode please you can go ahead and do that
1:10:33
especially when you click on edit with Elementor it would say I did with save mode or
1:10:40
load with safe mode and you just go ahead and you know just use it that way
1:10:45
don't worry everything will still be all right and you'll still be able to save it but another thing is this you need a
1:10:51
fast internet else things are going to be pretty slow if you know that the
1:10:57
particular internet in your area it's not really working well you can always go ahead and switch it where we're going to start from is the layout so Elemental
1:11:04
have different type of layouts very very very different types of layout here we have the sections right we have
1:11:12
we have sections we have inner sections we have test so look at the the left hand side this the left hand side this
1:11:19
is where you have your component tab this way you see everything you know everything that you're going to need to build your application and they're all
1:11:25
here everything every website that you ever see like take a look at this website and see
1:11:31
what's here you have test you have images you have videos and you have
1:11:36
buttons same thing you don't need more than these three things to actually build a complete landing page test
1:11:43
images buttons ships that's all you need to add this section to add a section to
1:11:50
this page so this page right here is called a full we started that's what it's called to change it we can go ahead
1:11:57
and click on this settings here click on page layout and say Elemental canvas
1:12:02
so canvas is just like an a drawing board like a white drain board that's
1:12:08
what canvas is a white drain board so to test is to add a test to this
1:12:14
we're just gonna just drag it so when you drag it it's going to give it a container itself just drag a test in
1:12:20
there and now you have a test to add an image to it just go ahead and drag the image right there and now you
1:12:27
have an image placeholder so you can see this is the image place of placeholder and you can just add an
1:12:33
image directly to it so I'm going to go ahead and delete it so if you add it click on the option Tab
1:12:39
and say delete click on the just delete so let's go back again and add a section to add a
1:12:46
new section I'll click on the plus sign and you can see how you divide your sections if you go back here you will
1:12:51
see if you go back here you will see some sections this section is divided into three one two three this section is
1:12:59
divided into three one two three this section is just one one this section is divided this is just a
1:13:06
picture section is divided into two one two and this is a complete single section so you
1:13:13
can see that depending on how you intend to run your are you intend to build your
1:13:19
page you you would likely be using one of these sections so I like to use the first one this is the first section
1:13:25
divided into two and so I can add section small section
1:13:30
inside a section this is one section and if I want to add two subsection inside
1:13:35
all I have to do is to drag this inner section in here which is one two you can
1:13:41
see we have two sections now if I click on the first inner sections I can change the height
1:13:47
just say mean highs like so so this height now is now 400.
1:13:52
and if I come here I can change the mean highs to feature screen which likes you
1:13:58
can see how large it is but don't worry about all these dragons that I'm all these dragons and I'm speaking to you
1:14:03
you don't really have to know all of it to be able to build a landing page so I'm gonna take this away inside this
1:14:11
section this is where everything is going to happen I can now drag a test in here
1:14:16
I can drag a sub test in here like a tester details if to drag this up
1:14:21
heading just use the test editor and then I can drag a button
1:14:26
so you can see basically everything is just dragging and dragging it as long as
1:14:32
you can drag things what that means is that you can build your own landing page simply by dragging
1:14:39
and let's say I want to drag a video in here I'll just drag it here and that's a video
1:14:44
so this is going to be a video so just like you saw on this other page this is a video and now this is a video so you
1:14:53
can drag the video in there and what else do you want to drag you can drag a form to so when you're doing lead
1:14:59
generation you can drag a form in here to see name email address and message you can drag
1:15:06
you can drag a whole lot if you're somebody who's writing code you can drag a code highlight in here and you see
1:15:12
it's a code just like that so it is um it is unlimited like the things you
1:15:19
can drag in here they are all limited unlimited so we're going to be using some of this to actually build the
1:15:27
Elementor page so go ahead and play with this you know just go ahead and play with this you drag things into the
1:15:33
screen drag it out and see what comes out of it and the one thing that I like about this whole drag and drop is this
1:15:39
countdown timer it's it helps you to stay a lot you know when you tell somebody that this thing is going to
1:15:45
expire in 24 hours they really want to buy this stuff so one thing I love about the content timer is that
1:15:51
it comes differently for everybody if I get to this website and
1:15:58
I I did every time I log into this website it gives me a time a cookie so
1:16:03
there's something a cookie is like something that follows you all over the Internet so it keeps telling what you do so if I say due date that means it's
1:16:10
going to end for everybody in 28 days but if I say Evergreen date
1:16:16
yeah Evergreen date and that date is 47 hours 59 seconds 59 minutes so what this
1:16:22
means is that for every one person the count is going to be different it's going to be very different so when I log
1:16:27
into the website my one day is going to start if my friend log into the website my 47 hours is going to start the next
1:16:33
week that he logs into the website so I like it if you it's super cool if you try to use this Evergreen timer for
1:16:40
everybody especially if you're selling digital product that doesn't expire but if you're selling physical products where you think that the promo will
1:16:45
expire you just go ahead and use the due date it's way way better than that than
1:16:52
than anything else so that's something I like and also I actually like the sidebar also so what
1:16:59
this sidebar does is that is it's it's just enables you to um you know to have something on the
1:17:05
side to have a menu on the side but you're not going to be using it a lot in this in this course so now it's your
1:17:12
turn go ahead and try Elementor go ahead and try the various aspects of Elementor drag things into the screen and drag it
1:17:18
out and see what you can you know make out of it when you come back we're going
1:17:23
to talk about colors and typography that's what we're going to talk about when you come back to this course so
1:17:28
we're going to talk about color you know the color that you decide to
1:17:35
use goes a long way in determining what you're selling
1:17:40
if you're selling something very feminine for kids you can use things colors that
1:17:46
are bright if you're selling things that are that are very expensive so you want to
1:17:53
use colors that are not very bright if you're selling things for the elderly you want to use colors or all sugar that
1:18:00
are not very bright and if you're selling things that has to do with nature so you want to go for
1:18:06
those natural colors also you know colors of the sky blue green you know things like that so you really
1:18:13
want to you know learn about colors a bit before you start before you start
1:18:18
using those colors on your website and also one of the ways that I think would be cool for you as a non-technical
1:18:25
person to to learn about colors is to just you know spy get a clue from what other
1:18:32
persons are doing in your Niche and use that those similar colors so you don't have to research too much and you know
1:18:37
break the bank and another thing that I also would also advise is that you use one color for
1:18:43
everything don't use Too Many Colors black is a good color for test just find the color
1:18:49
for other things just say hey my chest is going to be black and I'm going to find colors for other things
1:18:54
for example if you take a look at if you take a look at this you would see this
1:18:59
person is using black and this other color so outside black white is just a one
1:19:06
single color too many colors makes life very difficult if you look at this color this is just blue and the other color is
1:19:12
the background blue black and the other color is for the background too many
1:19:17
colors makes it very terrible look at this color this is black and red this other color is for the background and
1:19:24
the test is black so use one color for everything and just let it be very
1:19:29
minimal don't put too many colors everywhere it's going to be too hard on the eyes for people to read and so there
1:19:35
are different types of colors that you can use you can use complementary color
1:19:41
so I like to use monochromatic color which is one single color for everything it always just works so these are these
1:19:48
are monochromatic color and then we can choose the analogous color these are three colors in the
1:19:54
Triangle that align next to each other and then you can use the tragic color so
1:20:00
there are different colors you can come here and just find colors that you can use and see if those colors fit this is
1:20:07
where I get colors from and when I'm telling you to spy of course I'm going to show you the right way to to to to to
1:20:14
to to spar so you can just say color scheme so this is me doing it live right
1:20:19
here color scheme generator for website generator
1:20:25
so this is me just showing you how to do this so this is a color scheme so just go ahead and click on the first option
1:20:32
that you see click on the first option you see and say start generator
1:20:39
so this is going to give you some very cool color scheme but just go for tools and say explore palettes or palette
1:20:45
generator one of those explore palette or polish generator and not not so natural so just go to
1:20:51
explore palettes so you can see these are already made
1:20:57
pallets these are already made palettes that you can use for your website Without Really you thinking come here
1:21:02
and find the one that you think is fair for you to use and just choose one or two from this color and your life will
1:21:08
be easy for example this can be a background color so I'm on this one with the 25k
1:21:13
this can be a background color why these can be a primary color which is pretty straightforward like if
1:21:19
you come down here this this can be your this can be your background color why this can be your primary color or this
1:21:25
can be a primary color it really depends on how you want to you know how you want to do it you click on it you copy it for
1:21:32
example the way I would you know go about to go about testing this is to you know just pick this go back to my
1:21:38
Elementor I would you know clear this whole thing and just you know
1:21:44
clear this whole thing and just give it something like so and give it a height of say 400 and here I would click on it
1:21:52
go to my style I would say background color I would click on it
1:22:00
so this is my background color and then oh I think it's cool nice then I'll come back here and I'll pick one of this
1:22:06
color I want to pick this as my I want to pick this as my you know my primary
1:22:11
color or for my buttons so I'll come back to my Elementor I will come back here and drag a button in here
1:22:18
you know change the button color to change the button color to the color of
1:22:24
that red and I want to see how it looks like so when I change it I want to see how it
1:22:29
looks like and you know I want to see how this button looks like and if I think that it's
1:22:35
super cool for me it's really cool for me and then I think oh I think this is what I should use so just try that
1:22:41
similar stuff and you would see that it's cool one thing I didn't introduce to you in the last class I didn't tell you about this tie cap
1:22:47
the startup this is where you get to make changes you get to give style to your any element of your page as you can
1:22:53
see whenever I drag something to the page there's a star that comes alongside with it so for example I'm going to drag
1:22:59
a heading test here and I'm going to drag a test editor here
1:23:05
so as you can see if I click on the heading test you can see that this heading also has a style so when I go
1:23:10
back to my content I can decide to alignment means where do I want you to stay once they left right or Center and
1:23:16
Center Style so so this is a style typographic test
1:23:22
color I can change the test color to Green typography it's just like a handwriting typography is like
1:23:27
handwriting everybody have different types of handwriting and typography is just like so what it's asking you is
1:23:33
what type of handwriting do you want this to have so if I click on it I can have different type of handwriting don't
1:23:40
worry we're going to explain typography as you go different type of handwriting as you go so we're going to explore this
1:23:46
as we build our page I'm going to show you how to style things and how to make things work so you your turn go ahead
1:23:53
and experiment with uh Styles go ahead and experiment with choosing colors and
1:23:59
come back just pause the video go ahead and experiment with using colors come back and then we'll talk about
1:24:04
typography okay nice if you if you were able to
1:24:12
experimental regulations if you still need time to go back and experiment that is very fine so this is a an article
1:24:19
from canva that talks about you know the ultimate guides to fun pairing it's something I think that I think you
1:24:25
should use I'm going to leave it in the in the description cost document so you can find it there it's super cool so for
1:24:32
example if you're doing a design publication you know things have to be very legible and big but there's no one
1:24:38
we're interested in we're interested in the website part of it so let's just go to website
1:24:44
let's go to your website that's on eBook let's go to websites
1:24:53
okay I'm still looking for something so if you look at this you will see that there are different fonts for different
1:24:59
Industries there are different fonts for fashion different funds for retail different funds for
1:25:05
um Adventure different funds for almost everything so this is the funds for web
1:25:10
design so this is the fund they they know they recommended for web design you would see something that there is a
1:25:16
primary there is secondary and then this is the body so listen there is the primary yeah
1:25:22
there is a heading this is a heading which is the H1 this is the this is what you're going to use for the caption you
1:25:28
know like when you get to your website like let's go back here this is the H1 which is a caption this is the secondary
1:25:34
test like so and then if you go down here you will see the body this is the body and that's what they're telling you
1:25:40
yeah that's what they're telling you here say hey you're going to use ATP and 80 points as you're heading and you're
1:25:46
going to use 28 points as your secondary heading and then you're going to use 14 as the body
1:25:52
so if I were you I would just come back here and take any any fun pairing they give you here and use it on your website
1:25:59
because this pairing has been researched really well and I I'm not sure if you need something else or you know anything
1:26:06
else once you have this so you go ahead and check the pairing that you like here and use it on your website let's go
1:26:12
ahead and try this one so this is not too heavy and there is lato and then there is lateral so let's
1:26:18
go back here and try this let's turn this front topography just type on top
1:26:24
type later so this is lateral and this is 80 points
1:26:29
the size is 80. and the width is both you know like it's troubles like if you
1:26:36
come back here we can see that the width is bold not extra bolt and then we have 28 which is
1:26:42
the secondary button so we'll come back here this is bold not extra bold
1:26:48
bold and then we have this one this one is same thing with latto this is let's
1:26:53
just make it black this is typography is lateral
1:26:59
typography is lateral and it's just I think probably medium and we'll put it
1:27:04
in the middle let's see what that is
1:27:10
so we have 28 pixel that's very normal then the next one is the body front which is 14. so put the body which is
1:27:18
the test editor again just to test the detail that's what we're going to use as the body font and
1:27:23
this is going to be style it's going to be like so and typography would say lateral
1:27:29
just like that and 14. so you can see the differences it's this
1:27:35
is different a bit this is 28 yeah and this is normal
1:27:41
so you can see what this is so this is the this is the heading font this is this one this is the body font so let's
1:27:48
put in the middle also and this is for the button so you can see it's different so the reason why you use different font
1:27:54
weight and different font size it's so that your audience will understand what is important for you and what is not
1:27:59
important for you and and you know one thing about this is that nothing is written on Stone here if you think that
1:28:06
the color of this background is not so great you can go ahead and just change it to White and see I I think it's even better when
1:28:12
you when you leave it here like white or you can go ahead and say oh I'm not sure everyone is so great let's maintain the
1:28:17
color a little bit let me change the color a little bit and if I come back here I can reduce the
1:28:23
transparency a lot can we use the transparency a lot and I'd be like oh I think this is even
1:28:28
better for me so that's what I want you to do go ahead figure this out yourself try to combine make some different font
1:28:34
combinations see what works for you and join me in the next class where we're going to start building our home page
1:28:40
first thing we're going to be building our landing page we're going to build the hero section and so you see how things are done I'll see you in the next
1:28:47
lesson welcome back I hope you're able to use colors and typography now and you're great so let's go back again to
1:28:54
remember this is our practice page is not the main page for us so let's go back to and let's just exit this page we're not
1:29:00
publishing just decide later let's leave this page not publishing it
1:29:06
and then once I publish it I'm going to I'm going to go back and just go back to my page
1:29:13
go back to my page and just say add new page so this page I'm not going to give you
1:29:21
the title you you can give it a title if you want to but I can just give it a home that's fine but the title here
1:29:27
doesn't matter because I want to create just one single landing page here
1:29:35
I remember when we talked about colors and when we talked about you know all the stuff we're going to be using them
1:29:41
here first thing first I want you to go to you know click here and go to your
1:29:46
site settings go to your site settings and click on
1:29:51
global colors so you can see here we have parameter called our secondary color tertiary color Ascent color
1:29:58
so we're going to before we do that before we do that let's go back again
1:30:03
we're going to do two things so we're going to throw in a couple of buttons in here one
1:30:09
just just follow me to let's join another one three
1:30:16
let's join another one four so this is going to be so the color if
1:30:21
we go to style the color itself we're going to get the color from primary
1:30:27
yeah this color the background color sorry let's just leave this one as white
1:30:32
the background color here is going to be primary and let's click this next one
1:30:37
and make it style the background color here is going to be secondary make it
1:30:43
to let's get started to click the other one test click the other one the
1:30:49
background color itself is going to be ascent so the reason why I'm doing this is because I really want to show you how
1:30:56
it's going to appear so the accent color is majorly for the buttons you know anything buttons gears you as in color
1:31:01
so let's go back to our color wheel let's go back to our color so remember this is what we took we had this you
1:31:08
know in our previous class we had this so I'm going to choose something else
1:31:14
today I'm going to choose something as here choose a different color entirely so I'm
1:31:19
going to choose this one this not this one this one with thirty eight thousand seven thirty eight thousand seven
1:31:24
hundred likes so I'm gonna choose these as our I'm going to choose this as our Ascent
1:31:31
color which is going to be for the buttons so I'm gonna go back here I just drag this all the way
1:31:37
I'm gonna go back here this Ascent color so I'm going to go back to my side setting
1:31:45
site setting and click on my Global color for my accent color I'm going to change this to that color
1:31:51
that's my accent color and then for my for my test color my test color is
1:31:57
definitely going to be black it's going to be something close to Black
1:32:02
so Tuesdays it's going to be black definitely black and my secondary color my primary
1:32:11
color I'm not taking it from here so I'm going to just choose this one
1:32:18
primary color and my secondary color
1:32:24
I'm going to choose this one
1:32:30
so you can see this is the way all your entire colors will look like so I just click update after making those changes
1:32:35
and I'll click on the console so remember what we did in the previous in the previous class yeah we clicked on
1:32:43
the settings and we came back here and we said canvas Elemental canvas so we're going to be
1:32:49
modeling this I'm going to take this away I'm just going to be modeling one of
1:32:55
these you know we're going to be modeling one of these Pages because they're very similar
1:33:01
so let's model this one the only thing that we're not going to build we're not going to build the heading
1:33:06
okay let's just say We'll build everything so we're just going to model this particular
1:33:12
um this particular website might not build everything but we'll try our best to get ourselves a landing page I
1:33:19
remember that I when we when you started this course I showed you the elements of a landing page so we'll model this while
1:33:27
we are trying to you know get the design right to model The Heading subheading video newsletter and call to action so
1:33:34
let's add that in this video heading subheading video news since later and call to action
1:33:41
so for my heading this is going to be my heading I'm just going to copy this to be my heading and how do we do how do we
1:33:48
drag a heading into into Elementor I'm sure you remember click on the plus sign Let It Go like that
1:33:55
click here and we will then drag in a heading like so and just put this here and drag
1:34:03
to the middle I remember the last time when we when we checked out our font we
1:34:08
did not we didn't we we choose the font but we did not create a font style here I'm sure you remember
1:34:14
so to create a font style let's click on the set let's click on the settings like here go
1:34:20
back to our site setting so we can create a font style the reason why we're creating the style is you know we don't
1:34:25
keep on changing the font over and over and over again so my Global fund primary funds I'm just
1:34:32
going to call this latto lateral so that my primary font and I'm
1:34:38
going to call it 80 so you can see the font would change and call it 80 and this is going to be both
1:34:44
that's going to be my primary font I'll say it about uh you know come back here again secondary secondary also is going
1:34:51
to be my later font like so and this is going to be 28 like we did and then it's going to be
1:34:57
normal that's fine and then my test font is going to again
1:35:04
be lato then it's going to be 14.
1:35:10
like that then my body Ascent font which is for my button again it's still going
1:35:15
to be lateral it's going to be 18. 16 and then nice so we're going to say
1:35:24
update so once we update we will come back and
1:35:30
continue with our design so this is it so our style our typography font is our
1:35:35
primary which is like this don't worry like it good like this and then we'll
1:35:40
come back here this is our secondary like so dragging a test header here
1:35:46
paste [Music] paste go to our style
1:35:51
say typography secondary and then put it in the middle
1:35:56
put in the middle and then we can adjust this a little bit adjust this a little bit and what's the
1:36:04
next we want to add we want to add the video newsletter so the video newsletter just type the video
1:36:11
and drag put it in here so when you drag the video it's going to take the entire
1:36:16
width of the entire page you know it's going to take a very large width and then when you come back here you'll see
1:36:22
video Source there is YouTube there's Vimeo there is daily motion and then save hosted so to add video from YouTube
1:36:28
is very easy I'm going to open one of my channel and I'm going to copy a video so
1:36:33
like copy sure I'm just going to copy like so and I'll
1:36:38
go back to my Elementor I'll just click this now just when it says link click it
1:36:44
and then I should see my video directly from YouTube and here I can say if it's
1:36:49
auto play or not I can say if it's gonna be mute at the beginning or if I want it
1:36:55
to Loop when I'm in Loop it will keep on playing and playing and playing for a very long time and so the thing about
1:37:02
this so it's it's very very good choice to enable lazy lazy load yes but the
1:37:08
thing about taking videos from YouTube is that when the video is done playing it's going to show other videos so your users might get out of your website and
1:37:15
go watch some card video somewhere you might get out of your website and go watch some comedy so it'll be awesome if
1:37:21
you use Vimeo or you will simply record a video upload
1:37:29
it on on two WordPress and you are able to play that video yourself
1:37:35
with Vimeo you wouldn't need to see any advert neither will your
1:37:40
data with your um with those persons you're working with CNE at back so it's pretty straightforward and clean but you're
1:37:47
going to need to pay if you want to add more videos you're using like one or two videos you don't have to pay but if
1:37:53
you're doing more than one videos you'll pay so it's quite simple come here upload the video copy the video link and
1:38:00
that's all you have to do nothing else come here upload copy the video link and
1:38:05
cut that link come back to YouTube come back to you come back to your
1:38:10
Elementor paste it right here and it begins to play and there's something else you want to
1:38:16
know about this is the image overlay so if I put an overlay like before the user play the video if you want to design a
1:38:24
YouTube thumbnail a thumbnail and you can design it and then upload the thumbnail right here but all those
1:38:30
things doesn't really matter for me so I'm just going to go back to YouTube and then I'll paste my own video right there
1:38:37
once you're done with this the next thing that you want to do is to add a call to action because now you think that the person has seen your headline
1:38:43
seen your your secondary test watched your video and the next thing that the person would like to do you expect the
1:38:49
person to do is to take action and so we'll put it in the middle like this I remember when we talked about
1:38:55
action we said no using click here no using click there the action should be straightforward
1:39:01
um it should be purchase the course if you're selling a course or it could
1:39:08
be sign up for a free trial
1:39:14
so you can see sign up for a future app purchase the course or sign up for a
1:39:19
seven day free trial see it's not straightforward sign up for try out
1:39:25
purchase the call sign up for a seven day free trial straight followers so that's how you would fix the first part
1:39:31
of your website go ahead and try I really don't like this video getting past 10 minutes go ahead and try this
1:39:36
see if it's something to see how you can you know create something similar to this I'll create something similar to
1:39:41
this for your business and let's get started with learning how to create the other section of our landing page I'll
1:39:49
see you in the next class A Hero section and I'm sure now you've been able to put in your name put in your subsection and
1:39:57
put in the image and now you have the button and the next thing we want to do
1:40:03
according to our Pages here is to add social proof social proof can be
1:40:09
testimonials it can be companies that you have worked with it can be a lot of other things so this is the easiest way
1:40:15
to get Social proof ask your customers to do a video for you and send it to you
1:40:20
send it to you and then you put it here so let's just click on this and type testimonials
1:40:27
so you can see this Carousel it's called testimonial Carousel and then you also see testimonials and then you see review
1:40:33
so a social proof can be as Tiny as a simple tweet social proof can be a
1:40:38
testimonial and it can also be a review so this is the way I do social proof I
1:40:44
would ask my customers to tweet me like you know open my Twitter account and ask them to tweet me yeah when they tweet me
1:40:51
I will do a screenshot of the street and turn it into social proof so let's say
1:40:56
for example this is a tweet that is directed to me so I'm going to go to my notification
1:41:04
so then I'm going to go to this tweet so what I'll do is that I will take a screenshot of this street
1:41:09
like so I'll take a screenshot of the tweet and then I will you know crop it
1:41:15
I'm going to go to figure out a way to crop this so I'm going to crop the screenshot that's what
1:41:21
I want to do um adjust the size
1:41:26
so I'm going to crop it I'm gonna find this you know just screw up like this
1:41:33
so I think I should find it here crap so I will take this and then I would
1:41:40
save this save it on my PC and just call it testimonials
1:41:45
testimonial one just like that so I will find multiple pictures like this and just crop them
1:41:52
but but meanwhile these are tweet that is directed to me that is mentioned in my name so if this tweet is not
1:41:58
mentioned in my name and it's not directed to me there's nothing for me to do I'm not going to be using probably it's a tweet that says hey Paul I want
1:42:06
to say thank you for your course hey Paul I want to say thank you for creating the doing what you do is awesome so I will do that I would just
1:42:13
click on the plus sign I'll click on the plus sign and I'll click on this and then I will add inner
1:42:19
sections three inner section so you say one two three then I'll double click and you know duplicate this
1:42:26
intersection make it three and then on top of it I'll put a heading I'll put a
1:42:31
heading on top and this heading I will just call it testimonial
1:42:36
testimonials or if I don't want to call it testimonial I would there's another name that you can call this you can just
1:42:42
call it wall of love so wall of love and testimonial they're pretty similar or I
1:42:48
could say what other persons are saying say what others are the same
1:42:54
so what others are saying and then I will click on this and if you look at this you will see that this thing is too
1:43:00
close to the call to action button the section is too close and how do you separate those things together you do so
1:43:06
using margin and potting so imagine there's a space between two containers so don't really think about it too much
1:43:12
so for the top I would say 100 for the bottom I would just say a
1:43:18
hundred so you can see if I increase the potting a lot the more I reduce it the more it gets closer but the more I
1:43:25
increase it if it's 200 so if it's 200 you can see it's farther
1:43:31
and also I can reduce I can I can change the bottom margin and the top margin
1:43:36
differently so if I give the top 150 and I give the bottom 100 so it's going to
1:43:42
be a whole lot different so once we're done we're done with that I'm going to put images so like one image
1:43:49
I'm gonna put another image to image and I'm going to put another image three
1:43:54
image so don't forget that this is simply this is just an image that I'm using I'm using this particular image
1:44:01
that's what I'm using so I'm just using a tweet so I'm going to click on the image and upload the Tweet
1:44:08
select file remember that tweet that I cropped right so I'm going to come back here and find it so I'm just going to
1:44:14
find it testimonial that's it and I'm going to put it there
1:44:21
sell testimonial and insult
1:44:26
so we can see this is the testimonial and I've added it right there and then also you can do the same thing but for
1:44:32
the sake of time I'm just going to duplicate this for the sake of time I'm going to say Ctrl D Ctrl D then I'll
1:44:38
delete this other one I'll delete this I'll delete this
1:44:44
so this is a simple this is super simple is an easy way for you to get testimonials you can do this on Facebook
1:44:50
you can do this on Twitter the reason why I love Twitter is because of the size of the image that's the reason why I love Twitter you can do this anytime
1:44:56
and then to differentiate both of them we can come back here click on this yeah and just go to style
1:45:03
border we will add a butter and say solid butter and then we'll add a width
1:45:09
of like two you can see and the color we will give you one of the one of the
1:45:14
we'll give it the secondary color which is cool or we can give it the ascent color if we want to and then for the
1:45:20
radius you can say 15 that's fine for the radius and for Boss Shadow you just give it some you know some kind of
1:45:26
Shadow and the shadow can be the shadow can be one of the you know
1:45:32
not too much just like that and if you're okay with that simply drag this in and you will see the way a wall of
1:45:39
Love look like and then we would give it a and then after doing this I would give it a a
1:45:47
margin so you can see the margin top margin left so I'm going to give it a margin left of like 10.
1:45:54
see I won't check this and just give it a margin left of 20.
1:46:00
not margin left sorry give it a margin right of 20 so that it's a bit far from the next one and once I do that I'll
1:46:07
just copy this copy so this is a way to make things fast I'll paste it but I will not paste the the component itself
1:46:14
I'll just paste the style so once I place the style let you take it so this one I'll just paste this style also just
1:46:20
paste down just like that so you can see I just pasted everything and
1:46:27
and it works so you can see this is our testimonials and these are our wall of love there's another way that you can
1:46:32
also do these testimonials also another way you can do this testimonials I will go ahead and click on my I'll click
1:46:39
another click on this one so I think there's something here you can see this is so far from this other
1:46:45
one so click here the margin bottom here is in 1000 that's why it's so far so let's turn it to 100
1:46:51
so it's closer now another way you can do this wall of love is to just drag something in here and say testimonials
1:46:59
testimonials like that and put it in the middle and click here
1:47:04
and save testimonials just drag it in here
1:47:09
so you can see we have testimonial one testimonial two and testimonial three this is a slider so this is like a
1:47:17
slider like this let's say this it's just a slider and you can see the testimonial is saying um you know it's
1:47:23
just going to take the test to say what the person it wants to say and then uh the person's name and the person's
1:47:29
company and the image a good way for you to get this is to reach out to your client and ask them for testimonials
1:47:35
money else let them write it for you or put it to you and get their permission to to use it on your website and that's
1:47:42
it so we can go for the skin and say it's bubble you can you can choose different styles
1:47:48
for your testimonials so we have the bubble that's the skin and then we have the default the default is no bubble and
1:47:54
the bubble I like the bubble because it gives you a chance to you know make it distinctive and then we can say layout
1:48:01
image stock so you can have image stack image above
1:48:07
image left image right so like I just like it when
1:48:12
the image is uh when it's inline or stuck so that's the way I kind of like it in line of stock how many slides by
1:48:19
view let's just have three so if we have two that is just going to show two slides by view so we can have three
1:48:26
slides so this works this is super cool if you have a whole lot of testimonials to show
1:48:31
you can see one two three and then you can go ahead and then style the testimonials so we can say for the space
1:48:37
between we can style the content inside of it test color that's fine we can say
1:48:42
typography test which that's what we have already and then for the name color
1:48:48
we can change anything you want to change over here that's fine go ahead and play with this but I'll tell you our
1:48:54
testimonials to your website and another way to add things to your website again uh social proof to your
1:49:01
website is also adding reviews reviews like this so you can just draw it reviews is just like the testimonial
1:49:07
similar to this testimonial almost no different but it has a link so if somebody reviews you
1:49:14
on Twitter you can go ahead and just type the user and the person's username type the person's username and link to
1:49:21
that tweet so you can link to that to it and say that other persons will will see it but a good way for me I don't like
1:49:27
using review because it takes people off my landing page that's the reason why I don't like using
1:49:32
reviews and another thing that you can do is to star ratings so the way I would
1:49:38
do things normally is to click on the plus sign add a few pages add a few
1:49:44
columns and then click on the test editor and then add a start add a star
1:49:50
written so the star rating itself is just coming from my client so if my client is like hey I like what's poison
1:49:55
I like post job and then I can just put a storage like this person like my job put the person's contact info so that
1:50:02
other customers can reach out and that's the way I kind of like it
1:50:07
and then next on our list on this page it's um so we're talking about social proof our benefits benefits benefits so
1:50:16
benefits here it's what people will gain what people will gain when using your
1:50:21
platform when is a buy from you so you can see let's go back to the benefits so these
1:50:28
are like benefits let's go back to these are client testimonials let's go find the benefits okay there's no
1:50:35
benefit there uh let's go find it here
1:50:41
let's go find here okay there's no benefit over here
1:50:47
okay let's let's see um yeah so this is what you get these are
1:50:54
benefits here's what you if we you will get these are benefits on your sales
1:51:00
pages also you would figure out that there are tons of benefits there are tons of benefits that you can um that
1:51:06
you can also so these are benefits I'm gonna find it now so these are things that you get this is a video of
1:51:13
tutorials and other stuff so just go ahead swallow this in figure learn how
1:51:18
to prove to your landing page and you come back and we'll talk about features and benefits I see you in the next
1:51:24
lesson you will you will be able to add benefits to your website in different ways you can add features and benefits
1:51:30
together all in one sentence or you can add features separately and benefit separately normally if you're selling if
1:51:36
you're selling digital courses the features likely will be what you will get but if you're selling consultancy
1:51:42
the benefits will be the the the the features the benefits sorry it's just
1:51:48
normally if you're selling digital product the benefits will be what Jesus Will gain from doing things for you even
1:51:55
when you're selling the consultancy the benefit is what users will get when they consult with you that's that's the
1:52:02
benefit so now if we go back to our if we go back to our our
1:52:10
if we go back here you can see here we have testimonies and here you see benefits tons of benefits Cisco models
1:52:18
this is what you will get so you can make your benefits in different ways let's go back to our landing page go
1:52:24
back to our landing page and I'm going to I'm going to take it leave the testimonies like this and I'm going to
1:52:30
click here to add the benefits so you'll see how we're going to do that you click the plus sign and this will
1:52:37
just be what you stand to gain
1:52:43
once you start again that's what that's where it's going to be once you stand again so I'm gonna put in the middle all over
1:52:50
again the reason why I'm putting everything I'm I'm aligning everything to the middle is because I just want
1:52:55
consistency see this is the middle this in the middle everything is in the middle because I just want consistency
1:53:02
and then to add the benefits I'm going to add an intersection in here
1:53:07
I'm going to duplicate this intersection and then I will duplicate this top inner section on this inner section this first
1:53:14
intersection I'll come to the advancing I'll just add a pardon it might imagine I'll come back here again now I'll
1:53:21
imagine so I'm just adding 10 to it to just differentiate both of them and then I will add a test I'll add an icon
1:53:30
I'll add an icon to it I had a list icon list or a test one of
1:53:36
those is fine if I had an icon it's fine if I had a list it's fine anything I want to add to it is fine I can add an
1:53:41
icon bus so I like this icon boss so you see this
1:53:47
is a so one of the benefit might be um so let's just let's just I'm just
1:53:52
going to copy from here I'm just gonna copy find it here and
1:53:58
just copy this so
1:54:04
let's find the benefit so one of the benefit might be this one you'll get Advent Marketing sales system client
1:54:10
onboarding and the rest so I'm gonna say benefit one so this is like benefit one
1:54:18
benefit one and then this will be my test and this I can choose different
1:54:24
icons here I can choose different icon this is my benefit one so the benefit is
1:54:29
what users will get when they use your product what will users get when they sell your when you when they buy your
1:54:36
course what would benefit you just get when they book a call with you those are just the benefits so I can't really
1:54:41
Define the benefits for you because I don't really know about your business but for me just imagine what's the
1:54:46
benefit of you taking this landing page course it is because one I'm it's going to help you save money two is going to
1:54:52
help you save time three you'll be able to launch as many products as possible four you're going to make a whole lot of
1:54:59
money doing things on your own five you can be a very good slopreneur that means you can own many businesses online
1:55:04
without really dropping a sweat you see these are those are benefits that's what you see on every of my pages so I go for
1:55:11
benefits before features so um so um for the sake of time I'm
1:55:18
just going to duplicate this three times yeah for the sake of time and I'll delete this
1:55:23
I'll delete this and then I will duplicate this
1:55:29
and delete ones at the bottom
1:55:36
I would just you know delete this row and another thing that I always tell you is that don't be too scared to to play
1:55:43
play around so you see this is simple single color right this is a single color and you we can
1:55:48
really change it so we can go back here and just go to our Styles and say hey let's try this other color and see if it
1:55:54
works let's try this other color and see if it works go to our content try this
1:56:00
other color and see if it works if it works for you of course you can use it but if it doesn't work for you it's okay
1:56:05
not to use it and once you're done with Benefits yeah once you're done with Benefits the next
1:56:11
thing you want to go for you want to go for the features so you can see uh you can see what we said about our pages so
1:56:18
the features the processes benefits but I think benefits and features we can add
1:56:23
both of them together features might be if it's a course it might be 14 hours long 14 hours long uh it might be it
1:56:31
might be they will get templates it might be they will get you know calls with you
1:56:37
those are some of the like you know some of the features of what they are going to buy so it doesn't really affect them
1:56:42
it doesn't really affect it affects the end result but not like the benefits that we get so you can just do this
1:56:50
duplicate this and just call it features then the next thing is the process how
1:56:55
you do what you do the process here can be story can be a story
1:57:01
the processor can be a story the processor can be anything but just tell people how you do what you do I really
1:57:07
like to use videos here like videos here like one minute video one or one minute
1:57:12
and 30 seconds video but it's just basically a process so how do we do that we'll add another We'll add another
1:57:20
um section give it a parting like well like we always do 2020 downwards and on upwards and then we can add a
1:57:28
we can add a a tab so we cannot tab so I like to use this top a lot so we
1:57:36
can add tabs and when we are at the top we can we can go here and add a heading and
1:57:43
just call this processes uh purses that's fine if you say our
1:57:48
process is fine or you cannot oh you can actually call this how it works you know
1:57:54
how it works how we work this is going to be how we work it could be how it
1:57:59
works it could be how I compile the course so the way you the reason why
1:58:04
you're doing this you're just making yourself really real it's just making yourself really real that's why you're doing this how we work how it works how
1:58:11
I did this how I do that you're just trying to be very very real and then we put this in the middle like we always do
1:58:17
that will come back to our uh our stuff we'll put the alignment in the middle I'm not going to put it at the end
1:58:23
anyway I'm just going to put it in the middle here put in the middle or put it a space
1:58:28
between and then we can add more so here we can say step one step two
1:58:35
yeah we can say step one here then that's step one this is step
1:58:41
two so this is step three
1:58:50
this is step three [Music] this is step four
1:58:56
so you can see how it works step one step two step three step four and then I'll come back here and I want to change
1:59:04
my typography to my secondary step one step two step three step four so when
1:59:09
users click on any of this step they see a different information see click on any of the steps to see a different
1:59:15
information this thing it can be really longer than usual if we wanted to so for example I'm going to go back to step
1:59:21
four and just edit my step four click on it it can be longer than what it is
1:59:27
right now so you can see it can be a whole lot longer than what you see right there and also for the styling you can
1:59:34
increase the width of the butter if you want to you can increase the width and you can give it a butter color just like
1:59:40
the accent or you can give it the secondary but the color that's fine we can do so much here but
1:59:46
we're not really going to bother ourselves with a whole lot of this stuff but what I'm saying is that just show
1:59:51
people how you work this doesn't have to be like so it can be a video if you want it to be so next and not least is
2:00:00
um is adding yeah you see we just told what you get next on our list is adding
2:00:06
what users will get if you if you if you want users to book a call it's different
2:00:12
so another way to get very fast very fast is to duplicate this so let's just
2:00:17
go ahead and duplicate this section say right click and duplicate when we duplicate this we just drag it to the
2:00:24
end drag it to the end like so so we don't have to uh you don't have to
2:00:31
you don't have to you know repeat again what you will get so remember there are two things here
2:00:38
one is what you've gained and the other one is what you get this what you get is what you get when you buy the course if
2:00:45
it's a course what you get when you buy this this digital product that is what I'm going to give to you
2:00:51
so I'm going to delete this I'm just going to delete it and make it you know I can drag it Forward backwards sideways
2:00:59
and here I'm going to also delete this so don't worry I'm deleting everything
2:01:04
right I'm going to delete this and here I'm just going to drag something in here and say number one
2:01:12
this is just going to be number one and I'll put it in the middle and for my number what you get I'm going
2:01:17
to put the head in and I'm going to put an image
2:01:24
I'm going to put a head in I'm going to put an image so the reason why I'm doing this is that um you want to use Graphics that
2:01:30
represent a whole lot of thing here exception except you're asking users to book a call but if you're selling something if you're selling something or
2:01:36
this is a sales pitch for you you just want to use Graphics but if it's a landing page it's fine you can use anything you want to use but if it's a
2:01:43
sales page yes go ahead and use Graphics say like what you get for example if it's my course I'm going to say you get
2:01:49
Elementor plugin
2:01:55
was 49 US dollars so then I'll put a picture
2:02:01
here once I put that picture I will go again duplicate that's and I'll say
2:02:07
number two number two I would say
2:02:12
Bill ebook was
2:02:19
ebook was 30 US dollars so you can see this is how I am going to
2:02:26
duplicate it till I'm done but there's another way we can do this to you we can
2:02:33
also create another heading put in a hidden tab move it to the
2:02:39
middle this is what you get put in inner section like so put it in a section
2:02:46
I'll delete this I'll put in my inner section and just put headings see
2:02:52
headings put in icon
2:02:59
uploading icon on top put an icon put in heading and then just
2:03:04
put in what we get so I just put in heading put in the icon that an icon that signify what they will get I'm
2:03:10
putting heading so if I'm not that image person if I don't have a lot of image this also works too
2:03:18
so for the sake I'm just going to delete this I'm going to um
2:03:24
I'm going to delete delete this you know and I'm going to duplicate this
2:03:31
duplicate this um so why not go ahead and you know set
2:03:36
this up for yourself set this up for your site practice this and when you come back to the next class I would have
2:03:42
you know fixed this fix the would have fixed all this heading and fix the test
2:03:47
and then we'll go ahead to the next section of the course I'll see you in the next lesson all right once you're
2:03:53
done with the features and the benefits the next thing that we're going to be adding is CTA so the city for me it's
2:04:01
still going to be a different similar CTA but we're just going to put this at the bottom of the benefits put it in the
2:04:08
middle like so and here we will say something remember on top of it we say
2:04:14
sign up for feature on
2:04:19
again we will say be the first to get started
2:04:25
or if we have a promotion we would say grab the promo now
2:04:31
if we have a promotion so that's basically what we're doing if you have a promotion grab the promo now
2:04:37
and we can make it big this is small we can make it big and also we can even include an icon we can include an icon
2:04:45
that says let's just say money let's add a money icon like so so we could include an icon and we can
2:04:52
tell where the icon should be we say the icon should be after and we can tell how the icon should
2:04:57
space so we can put an icon right there to you know just give people the just
2:05:02
give people a clue of what we're trying to make them do and after this we'll add the about
2:05:07
section the back section we'll just we're going to use two two section and
2:05:13
as usual give it a padding on top and below give it a pattern on top and below
2:05:21
and what you're doing here is that you're telling your own story as it relates to the product don't tell people
2:05:27
about the university you want to accept is going to have an effect on these sales don't tell people about how you do
2:05:34
this how you do that but instead just tell people you buy yourself as it relates to the current product that you're selling don't be very very
2:05:40
generalistic here so I'm going to add a a say if it's in one person I'm gonna
2:05:46
say about me about me oh I'm going to say why or you can use
2:05:54
something cool like why you should by from me
2:06:00
why you should buy from me so this is in some sense in a way it's actually helping you to avoid objections that's
2:06:08
what you're doing in such a way to help you avoid objections why you should buy from me so I'll go back to this style
2:06:13
I'll just give it a mean half the 400 that's fine uh let's give it a mean height of 500.
2:06:20
mean height of 500 and then we're going to add more tests to this we're going to add this and then we're going to add
2:06:27
test editor and this is going to be my secondary
2:06:35
test which is fine and I'm just going to come back here and
2:06:40
just steal and about from somebody
2:06:46
so I'm just gonna steal and about you can see this about itself it's this person sells Automation Services and you
2:06:53
can see this person is just telling you about how they run automated services
2:06:59
and I'll come back here to my Elementor and I'll just paste this don't worry
2:07:06
I'll paste this and I'll take this from here
2:07:12
I'll take this for me I put it here and then here I would say
2:07:18
meat meatball so I think it's easier this way mid pole
2:07:24
and then I will pull some image of myself over here so an image of myself
2:07:30
moving here and this I will click on this go back to my style turn it into my
2:07:35
primary Style turn my into my primary and this is my second drill ready and I'll go back here
2:07:42
click on this test color is fine I'll turn it into my test which is fine and
2:07:49
then there's something else that you might want to do sometimes you're designing and you know you're not very sure if what you're designing is really
2:07:54
legible so what you can do is that you can increase the line height
2:07:59
like this so that's like this it has just some sort of a spacing in between so normally you're using line height of
2:08:06
18. 18 22 22 18 is fine so that it's very readable
2:08:14
and legible for people who are interested in reading about what you do and I've come to think of it also this
2:08:20
can also be a video if you have a video please if you have a video that you can use of course you can use it and you can
2:08:26
also add fun things to yourself you can also add fun things like you can add fun things that you do to yourself
2:08:34
it doesn't have to be so straightforward like an interview the more fun you are
2:08:39
the more real you are the more people will likely buy from you
2:08:44
so after this the next thing that we're going to add to our page is the CTA again so it's a social proof again so to
2:08:53
add the social proof it's pretty straightforward we can just copy copy the social proof on Top Copy the one we
2:09:00
have on top here this one copy this one do a control
2:09:06
you know do copy just copy come back here to the bottom right there
2:09:12
and just paste it but when you copy it replace it replace
2:09:18
it if you don't have enough enough testimony don't bother copying don't bother adding another let's use your
2:09:23
proof but I would say use as many social proof as possible use a whole lot of social proof and here you can see that
2:09:30
this the the spacing between the fresh approve and second show proof it's very little so here we'll just come back here
2:09:37
uncheck this give you the matching button of say 50 that's fine give it a margin bottom of
2:09:44
50 we will come back here check it go to Advanced then give the margin bottom of
2:09:50
50 like so so that there's space so once you're done with that the next thing for
2:09:55
you is that you want to overcome objection and how do you have a common objection you do so by answering your
2:10:01
questions there's a book that I read one time it's called the ask you answer that book will teach you how to overcome
2:10:07
objections but don't worry it's just a simple thing think of all the questions that your customers will likely ask and
2:10:12
answer them beforehand so you don't have people sending you too many emails because they think you they don't
2:10:18
understand your product so how do you do that here you just do that using FAQs just type FAQ over here
2:10:26
there's no FAQ just type accordion type accordion or you type toggle so I'm
2:10:33
going to use the accordion so what the accordion does is that this this is like an FAQ yeah but you need to also add a
2:10:40
heading too so I'm going to say add a heading and just call it FAQ
2:10:46
and I'm still going to put in the middle and for my FAQ I'm going to say I'm
2:10:51
going to ask questions that people always ask like price delivery location you know what's included age grade range
2:11:01
these are things that I included so such a such a question I would say
2:11:07
what is the price what is the complete price
2:11:15
something like that and number two I would say can I use coupon choice so
2:11:23
this basically is not going to be from your head but um it's gonna be from your head if you
2:11:30
are just starting if you don't have any customer but if you have customers and you've had objections before this is
2:11:35
going to be from your customers response what's what's the complete price can I use coupon twice
2:11:41
um something like how do you deliver how do you deliver
2:11:47
your service how do you live by your services another
2:11:52
thing might be is there a reform policy
2:11:59
so how do you live is there a refund policy so these are questions that you basically want to answer and one one
2:12:06
other way to do this make it very legible make it very very legible very legible
2:12:12
see bother with make it very legible for people to for people to you know want to answer very
2:12:20
legible for you so uh for the topography go to typography make it as legible as
2:12:26
possible make it very legible for the content typography test
2:12:34
so we can increase it here because we just want it to be illegible
2:12:40
this is where you're going to have is this where you're going to have a lot of people coming once you are able to
2:12:45
answer the questions they're always asking here then you are very sure that you're going to make a sale or you're
2:12:50
very sure you're going to have people you're going to have people do what take an action on your landing page
2:12:58
so let's go back to our let's go back to our dock
2:13:04
so right here we also have CTA and privacy policy so we have ctas I'm going
2:13:10
to copy I'm going to just put another CTA which is another button down here put it here
2:13:18
uh your last chance to purchase
2:13:24
so these are like CTA this is where you're going to add to it you're going to add the CTA and then you add your
2:13:30
privacy policy your privacy policy can be it will just be a link but these are all the things that I think you can add
2:13:36
your privacy policy you can generate your privacy policy and just add it as a link how are you going to how you're
2:13:42
going to do this um this would be further down below so we can do like click on the plus sign
2:13:48
click on the on the section click on the action uncheck this and just make it like
2:13:54
200. so that your privacy policy is so far below so we can add a plus and we can
2:14:02
then say we can then just add the test when we add the test we'll click on the
2:14:08
style we can then add a test to it I would say C uh privacy
2:14:16
policy here so this here this is what you want to
2:14:22
link to you click on the link here and then you can add a URL so you'll notice once I put a URL it will change in color
2:14:30
so you can see to change to a red color once I put the URL but
2:14:35
um if you're not saying it's selling things that are very sensitive and you're not calling collecting that user information
2:14:41
there's no need for this part but if there's any things I have to like plus 18 you know you need to add the terms
2:14:47
and conditions somewhere on your website so let's see other things that you can add
2:14:52
um okay I think this is it is a bit long so I'll see you in the next class where we just round it up we just ran this up
2:14:58
I'll see you in the next class but you need to add to your landing page
2:15:04
to make it make sense but if you want to add other things it's fine and I'm going to show you a few other things that you
2:15:09
can add number one I told you about the content timer
2:15:14
I told you about the contact timer that you can add this is a contact timer and you can add
2:15:20
it I like it when it's Evergreen yeah I like it when it's Evergreen you
2:15:25
just put the time and it starts counting for every person and another thing that I think you can
2:15:30
add also is a time so it's a countdown so let's say you've worked for 500
2:15:37
persons before in your life so you can you can be like you know put a head in and just say 500 or 500 Founders 24 000
2:15:45
and you know stuff like that and it just makes sense this is some sort of a social proof why this this timer is a
2:15:52
shield probe this right here is just a way for you to allow people to be in a
2:15:58
history to make a purchase from you so um another thing that you can also
2:16:05
use also you can use a pricing table if your course if you're the what you're selling have different prices you can
2:16:12
also use a pricing table a pricing table is is pretty similar to it's very
2:16:18
similar here you can use this so this is a pricing table and all you have to do is just duplicate it that's what you
2:16:24
have to do duplicate it uh so we have three pricing table here
2:16:29
but just I will take this away so this way I'll add the pricing table I
2:16:35
will just add the section and inside the section I will add a one pricing table here and duplicate it and inside that
2:16:43
other this other section I will add a pricing table also so you have one using
2:16:49
table and then you can put two prices for what you want to do and then users can click it and you just can click it
2:16:56
and you know make a purchase from you if they want to
2:17:02
and another thing that you that you also want to do another thing that you can do is to
2:17:08
say I'm looking for it right there is to add another thing that you can
2:17:14
also do is to collect image from this directly so this all these buttons that you're clicking they should link
2:17:20
somewhere remember so if you want to link them somewhere this can link to your payments you can link to a payment Gateway you can link to other places I'm
2:17:27
going to show you how to link this your payment Gateway using Pay stack but if you're not using Pay stack all that it
2:17:32
will be very very similar so let me tell you how easy it is I will click I will
2:17:38
okay I think I'm going to cover that on a different course entirely just cover payment
2:17:44
okay let's go let's go over here so if I click here stand up for saving the trial or make payment all I have to do is to
2:17:50
put a link right there to put a link here and I'll be able to do what I want to do with it so if you want to collect
2:17:57
payment as a Nigerian you can use pay stock you can use um lots of other payment Gateway so what
2:18:03
I'll do is that you go to your playstock like so just go to play stock
2:18:09
and you would have to register without you have to register if you
2:18:14
don't have an account create an account it might take you a while for you to create a company account but if you are an individual you just go ahead and
2:18:20
create account and you can collect money but not to do turn off a not a ton of
2:18:25
millions like a corporate entity so I'm going to enter my email and then
2:18:30
enter my password so once you enter your email I'm using
2:18:36
OTP so it's going to ask me to it's going to ask me to add my OTP for my authentication app
2:18:44
this is another way to secure your account because you don't want people to be able to get into your account without
2:18:50
your permission so you want to do double authentication so that every time a person wants to log
2:18:56
into your Facebook account you would enter this OTP it's very it's very very very very very
2:19:03
very important so I've not been selling for a long time so this is my first course in a while so
2:19:10
you can see Zero but if you go back to my transactions you would see that I used to have tons and tons of transactions
2:19:16
so you would fill your details first of all and then after filling your details you will
2:19:22
fulfilling your details you know entering everything and making sure that you meet the requirement you would click
2:19:28
on you'll click on you'll come here and just click on payment Pages this is what
2:19:33
you want to click on click on payment Pages create new payment pages is it a one-time payment is it a recurring
2:19:40
payment is it a product payment no it's a one-time payment so click on the one-time payment and then I'll just
2:19:45
click on say demo landing page I'll put a tiny description if I want to
2:19:52
I can put an image if I want to and I'll collect the first amounts from this Vista Mart will be maybe 5 000 R from
2:20:00
this collect phone number yes it's advisable that you collect phone number from this page so you can do SMS marketing very very effective so I'll
2:20:08
copy the link once I come here I'll copy the link and then I will come back to my element to my Elementor and just place
2:20:15
the link here that's it paste the link all over here I need the call to action to happen if I
2:20:22
also want users to book a call with me I will go to calendly and just paste my calendar so
2:20:28
um so I'm just going to call this book a call so I'm going to call this book a call
2:20:34
thank you recall and here I'm going to say calendly .com
2:20:44
so I'm trying to link here and then when I'm done with this to see what I've done so far I'm going to click on this
2:20:49
preview change button click on the preview change button it should open my website and another my
2:20:56
landing page on a different tab entirely because I'm just previewing the page so we can see what we've done so far when
2:21:03
we click on the sign up for free trial it should take us to pay start okay you can see it's because the space type
2:21:08
where it's telling us to make payments for that and then when we click on when we click
2:21:15
on this other page this one book a call it should open currently
2:21:20
call so there's something else when we click
2:21:27
on this go back to this button we can tell this button to open in a new page by clicking on the star and say open in
2:21:33
a new window so what will happen is that this button will just open in a new window entirely that's what happened
2:21:40
and also when we click when we come back here we can also tell this one to say hey open in a new window entirely
2:21:46
opening a new window entirely and that's what's going to happen let's if you're in if you are in Nigeria
2:21:52
or you're using any other payment Gateway this is the same thing that you do go back to the place where you created
2:21:57
your payment link and indeed so when you close it when you when you go back you will see redirect after payment you see
2:22:03
this redirect customer payment this is where you will add what you want your course what you what you want to give to your customer what you want to give to
2:22:10
your customer or how you want to give them this is where you add it if you want them to join a group you know go to your parents you go to your WhatsApp
2:22:15
this is where you will add it if you're selling something something that looks like an ebook or a product that you add
2:22:21
to a drive uh this is what you do is what you do you just go ahead and go to like Google
2:22:27
Drive go to your Google Drive yeah so you would upload whatever you
2:22:32
want into that Google Drive and then copy the link that's what you do if you are somebody who is selling eBooks or
2:22:38
any other material say for example you click on new and then you file upload upload the file let's say I want this
2:22:44
book to be the book that my users will receive when they finish purchasing my course I would say sure and I would say
2:22:52
share to everybody or restricted anyone with the link can get it and I'll then copy and say done so what my users are
2:22:59
necessarily doing is that they are buying that link that's what they are buying that's what they're buying so I'll go back to my pay stack and I'll
2:23:05
paste it here and so whenever there's a purchase what do you want you want to send notification to your email whenever
2:23:10
there's a purchase so that you can you know some sort of happiness you know so when you make a punches you're pretty
2:23:16
happy when you do that so you come back here and just hit hit the publish button if you know you're
2:23:23
done with this page hit the publish button and then you can share you can share this page all around the place and
2:23:29
it's going to make sense for you but we still have a few things to do a few steps before we share we want to check our
2:23:36
page on mobile remember we said we're building a very respect we have to build for this different we have to build a
2:23:42
mobile mobile is way important than desktop so this is for tablets and this
2:23:47
is for mobile so first of all check it so you can see I had three to five high
2:23:52
ticket clients each month this is so big for mobile so we'll come back here change our typography make it say 40
2:23:59
make it 40 I'll make it 50 not too bad and this
2:24:05
is big two so we'll come back here typography make it 20
2:24:10
which is not so bad and then we put that image so we'll just keep on making slight changes you know very slight
2:24:17
changes to make sure that this is it's not so big so you can see let's come back here make it 50
2:24:23
not so big come back here you know we just make very very slight changes to make sure that on mobile what we're
2:24:30
doing is very cool and on desktop it is very very cool awesome so let's see what we've got it already
2:24:38
so let's see where we are already so we've done typography we've
2:24:43
uh call to action landing page more expensive and optimizing load time so
2:24:49
let's go ahead and you know go through other parts of the course so I see you in the next class go ahead
2:24:56
and practice this I'll see you in the next lesson and also don't always forget to click update you know click update
2:25:02
whenever you're done within with an iteration click the update button and that's all you have to do so now that
2:25:08
you've learned about how to build your own personal landing page one thing that I would say is that nothing is constant
2:25:15
really as you learn you get to change it as you learn you get to change it as you learn you can make adjustments but the
2:25:22
good news is that you can build a landing page under a day and ship as fast as possible so I'm going to go back to my I'm going
2:25:29
to exit just watch I'm going to exit and if we go back to our page let's just go
2:25:35
back to our main page itself you can see that this landing page our PhD looks
2:25:40
like this where's the landing page we created we can't find it so go back to our page
2:25:46
click on the on the WordPress icon then we'll come back to our settings come
2:25:51
back to come back to your reading not writing come back to reading and then we would
2:25:58
say what your own page should display what would say home page and which of the home page oh that's all say save
2:26:04
changes and once you see safe changes go back to our website and just refresh it once you
2:26:09
refresh it you should see that particular page that you created so it's just the name of the page that you would see
2:26:18
okay it's not working let's go back again
2:26:24
show the home page uh let's click on Save changes
2:26:29
go back to our page and this should be the front page yeah
2:26:37
let's just view oh this is not working very well let's
2:26:44
just let us View come back
2:26:53
that is preview come back
2:27:01
so let's go to all post I'll come back to my page and see what's
2:27:07
happening so I'll just edit the Elementor and see what's happening
2:27:15
[Music]
2:27:22
so this is our page and this is supposed to work so I'll just click on so this is updated
2:27:30
already I'm gonna preview it one more time and see what happens so this is the page
2:27:37
that it's supposed to show and then let's go ahead and refresh this
2:27:43
uh let's pause all cards just click here and support all right let's see what's going to happen
2:27:51
okay yeah so that's that's just the issue so now we have this showing right
2:27:56
here so nice you were able to build this remember this is just a plus hold on something you can get very creative and
2:28:03
modify modify your page as far as you know cool as you want you can get very very creative modifying it the best tool
2:28:10
that you can and come up with that with the best results that you can so now that we are good with that let's go back
2:28:16
here and see how to you know optimize our page
2:28:25
so I'll click this I'll go back to my WordPress site and so
2:28:31
when it comes to optimization one of the best in the way to optimize your page is analytics you click on plugin go to add
2:28:37
new plugin so this is where you're going to add your analytics um under your hair just type Google
2:28:44
just type Google and you should see a few just at Google and this is the one you
2:28:50
want you want Sidekicks Google sidekick that's what you want so just install
2:28:55
this will just enable you to add this particular website to your Google search kit so let's click activate
2:29:07
so when you click on activate the setup is pretty straightforward it's not the most difficult thing in the world the
2:29:12
setup is pretty straightforward and you will be able to set up your Analytics
2:29:18
and so why are you setting this analytics first of all you want to know what people are clicking when people
2:29:23
click on your website you really want to know when they click on stuff on your website you really really want to know why they are cooking you know what you
2:29:30
want to know where they are checking where they are saying how they are checking it and all that
2:29:36
so you will say connect your analytics sign in with Google so you just choose a Google account that
2:29:42
you want to sign up with you don't need anything all you need is a Gmail account so I'm going to sign up with this one
2:29:47
hmm sign up with this one and I'm going to continue so just keep clicking yes yes
2:29:55
yes yes yes yes as you go just click keep going yes okay sign up yes sign up
2:30:01
yes so I'm gonna I'm gonna go again sign up with Google I think there's something wrong with that click on this
2:30:09
uh see and download yes just check them out check all this stuff and say continue
2:30:15
and then say verify
2:30:26
and once you verify say allow and say setup
2:30:34
say nest so this is this is the first step
2:30:42
so this is the first step and now you're saying account page property all site data Nigeria so just go ahead and create
2:30:49
account so what you do in your creating analysis account that's what you're doing click on this again as the account you want to create your with and just
2:30:55
click on this check both and say continue
2:31:05
and then it's going to it's just going to alt so like it's going to alt and
2:31:10
show you analytics so you're going to agree to the terms and condition agree to these terms and conditions so
2:31:17
you just go ahead and agree you know just agree to all the terms and say I accept then you go back then you can go back to
2:31:24
your dashboard and once you see this is your dashboard and here you can see it will show you
2:31:31
all your data your traffic the content your site speed monetization so it's
2:31:36
going to show you all your all your analytics so this is where it's going to tell you like this is how much traffic that is coming to your to your landing
2:31:42
page and this is what you are this is what you're actually getting this is what you're actually getting
2:31:49
from this traffic coming to your landing page so that's one way to optimize so let's go try another way to optimize
2:31:55
your landing page so that's one way to to to do so and then you can see all the
2:32:01
improvements that you have to make so let's try another way we'll go back to our pages and this time we want to
2:32:08
make our site as fast as possible click on plugin and say add new and then we want to say speed so just
2:32:15
type speed here just type speed
2:32:20
and and when you type speed you would see a couple of you know a couple
2:32:27
plugins that will come up when you type speed so this is the one I this particular one is here already
2:32:32
Lightspeed catch you just click on update just update it and also you can also use
2:32:38
WP optimize if you want to but light speed catch is okay that's fine you can
2:32:43
use that also and what you want to optimize for next is
2:32:49
security so the plugin that you can use is to carry so just click on it and you can optimize
2:32:54
for security with this plugin so you would also just all you have to
2:33:02
do is to install it that's all you have to do install it once you install it it will secure your it will add more
2:33:08
security to your application install and activate it it will add more security to your website
2:33:14
um you don't want anything happening to your website you don't want anything happening to what you've created so just
2:33:19
install it and then come back here and just you know um raise it again just come back here
2:33:25
and say dashboard and when you come when you when you get
2:33:31
here you would see it's it's actually secured already but when you go when you get here you just have to
2:33:38
um so you can see here this site is clean and no blacklisted so it's cool it's just gonna you know keep running
2:33:45
around your website and securing things for you um there's a premium version that you
2:33:50
can use yeah there's a premium version that you can use and you can you can set up a whole lot more with they say feel
2:33:56
free to read a read up about it and I think I think that's that's basically it for you know optimizing and
2:34:04
also you cannot there are tons of other plugins that you can use but I think for the basics of somebody who's not who's not really calling this is the easiest
2:34:11
way for you to you know optimize your optimize your website and just optimize it very well so that's it for this for
2:34:18
this lesson next lesson when you come I'm going to show you how to design a lead generation landing page so we just
2:34:25
designed the landing page but I'm just going to quickly show you within five minutes how to design a lead generation landing page that's it so the next thing
2:34:32
that you're going to do here is we're going to create a landing page for you so the landing page itself let's just go
2:34:39
to Pages don't worry it's going to be very very fast it's a landing page but it's just a legion page because I think
2:34:44
that a lot of time you you would want to create a legion page then take them to the to the six page so we just call this
2:34:52
Legion and we'll say edit
2:34:59
so maybe what we want them to do we want them to download a book or download the course and download the material it's
2:35:04
just pretty straight it's just very straightforward so we'll come back to our page layout and say page canvas so
2:35:10
meanwhile if you want to if you want to get your you know you want to fix your book canva is the best place for me that
2:35:16
you can fix your book with um just come back here and on canvas say book
2:35:23
just go ahead and say um
2:35:29
so just go ahead and say and say book and and then let's just find let's just
2:35:34
go back home and we'll just type book let's type book again template
2:35:42
type template here so we'll say we want to create a book so
2:35:48
let's just keep click on book so we would do this on canva we would
2:35:55
maybe this is a I'm just going to use any random book that I see so let's say this one
2:36:02
and I'm going to customize this one so I'm going to customize this book and
2:36:08
then I will go back to my I think there are some apps here there's some apps here that can help you
2:36:14
to there's some apps here that can help you to create a few things I think
2:36:19
um I can help you to create mock-ups so just let me just type mock
2:36:27
um I think mock oh
2:36:37
I think there's some I just hope I'm saying it clearly but I think there's some apps that were enable you to create mock-up here on
2:36:44
on on canva
2:36:51
but I'm not seeing it here I'm not seeing it here right now uh but you can
2:36:56
or you can actually you know let's just imagine that this is the book and then we can just we we get to download this
2:37:03
particular book and yeah we get to download it and this is
2:37:08
the book that we want to give away to our to those persons who will download the the legion
2:37:15
and so we will go back to our site and this is where you would usually do it
2:37:20
you just you know make it divisible by two and then we will just you know make the
2:37:26
height mean height like show and then I will put an image
2:37:31
so this is going to be the image of the book when I put it
2:37:37
it's going to be the image of the of the book so now now you have the image of the
2:37:45
you have the image of the book uh successfully so you should see you
2:37:51
should see that book image over here and then we'll just go ahead and add a heading you know go ahead and add a head
2:37:57
in here and add a test over here close to the book and then we'll add a form
2:38:04
so we'll add a form so this is where people add their email so are the form you will add an email will take the form
2:38:11
we just need the name and the email or we just need the email so the less the feed you have the better your form is going to come back so the form name
2:38:18
we're just going to call it Legend form solution we're going to call it Legion
2:38:24
form which is fine and then we will go ahead and say input size is large and then we'll go ahead and you know just go
2:38:32
to the button and say we'll go to the button and come back to
2:38:37
the content here click on buttons make it large then we'll go to the button and
2:38:42
say download now so remember we should always use a web an action word in this
2:38:49
we should always use a use an action word one word in call to action I remove the label so the email here is the label
2:38:56
I remove the label over here because I want people to download so here once you see this book we will see this so when
2:39:03
people download it what do we want to happen that's why we have this action I have to
2:39:08
submit to collect the to collect the submission email the person so we have
2:39:13
collect submission email depression email you as the admin admin and then we
2:39:19

2:42:33
that you can install it's called Microsoft Clarity it will basically show you how your site how your customers are
2:42:40
moving in and out of your website so I'm going to type it I'm going to paste it there so you should see it
2:42:47
Microsoft Clarity it's a free heat map and recording section all you have to do
2:42:52
is to basically paste your website in there so just sign in see live demo let's see the live demo so you see
2:42:59

2:43:06
many different parameters the countries where they are coming from all you have to do is register and put your website
2:43:12
in there and you'll be able to get so much information from your website so it's super cool this is a dashboard this
2:43:19
is a recording so it's just like somebody looking at your website and seeing what's happening in your website
2:43:24
live just like that hit Maps it will show you let me let me show you this heat maps all this will show you is to
2:43:30
show you where exactly people are clicking so that's the reason why I told you majorly it's optimizing so you see
2:43:36
where you have this heat where you have all this heat it means users are clicking it so to tell you
2:43:41
number one see this is number 10 15 the numbers but let's go find number one
2:43:49
this is number 72 it means people are not really clicking these a lot so number one is the past where people are
2:43:54
clicking the most so where you have the red the red heat map that's where people are clicking the most so here we have all this red that's
2:44:01
where people are clicking the most but the place where you have the blue light blue people are not really clicking that
2:44:06
