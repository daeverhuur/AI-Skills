hi I'm James a web analyst specializing in analytics ad operations and SEO I'm
0:14
working with Wix Studio to guide you through this module of our course all about Google search console an essential
0:21
resource in SEO to start with we'll look at how to connect to and verify a site
0:27
through Google search console we'll get you familiar with all the reports Google search console has to offer from
0:33
performance reports to crawl stats and everything in between and finally we'll
0:39
give you the lowdown on how to connect to another useful Google tool for SEO Google analytics 4 by the end of this
0:46
module you'll be able to navigate Google search console with ease and know many ways to analyze a website ready to get
0:54
started great let's jump in beginning with our first lesson an introduction to
1:00
Google search
Get to know Google Search Console
1:06
console if you want a website to succeed on Google you need to understand how
1:11
visitors make their way to its content that means understanding how Google sees
1:16
that content and the keywords people search on Google that lead them to the web
1:22
pages these two factors are the foundation for successful SEO whether you're working on an Enterprise level
1:28
website or a personal blog and there's one resource you can use to learn them both Google search console in this
1:37
lesson we'll talk about what Google search console is and look at its main dashboard and the information it gives
1:43
us later in the course we'll take a deep dive into search console reports and the
1:49
actions you can take based on their
1:56
findings Google search console is a completely free tool that gives you direct access to information that Google
2:03
has about a site it can tell you if there are any problems that might be holding back your client's performance
2:10
in Google's organic search and it's available to anyone who owns or manages a website and completes the verification
2:17
process search console is not just any reporting platform it also allows for
2:22
two-way communication with Google you can use it to tell the search engine
2:27
about a site and ask it to take particular actions such as reindexing a
2:33
page or removing a page from search results entirely whether Google actually acts on
2:39
those requests is a different matter now I should say that Google isn't the only search engine or the only
2:46
source of organic search traffic many other search engines have their own equivalent of search console for example
2:54
Bing offers Bing Web Master tools but as Google makes up over 90% of the global
3:00
search engine market share it makes sense to start with search
3:09
console let's dive into the search console dashboard now when you open search console you land here on the
3:16
overview report this gives you top level metrics for search consoles four key reporting sections performance indexing
3:25
experience and enhancements you'll see that these are the same sections that are listed in the main menu let's talk
3:32
through them first Up Performance this shows you the number of clicks the site
3:38
has had from organic search over the past three months indexing this shows
3:43
you how many pages are included in Google's index and just as importantly how many are not experience this shows
3:51
you whether those pages offer a good user experience as Google understands it
3:57
it also tells you whether the pages are http PS which is secure or HTTP which
4:03
isn't and finally enhancements these are special features on a site that use
4:08
structured data things like video breadcrumbs and search boxes can all use
4:14
structured data to tell Google more about a site and its content if you work
4:19
on more than one website you can switch between them in search console using the dropdown menu in the top left corner
4:26
before you can select a website you first have to verify in search console and that's what we'll look at in our
4:32
next lesson how to verify a site and what to do after it's verified see you
Verify a site
4:44
there to use search console you need to verify a site to prove that you own or
4:50
manage it this is to stop other people from accessing private data about the
4:55
website or even making changes that will affect how it appears in Google
5:01
search Google gives you a number of methods to verify a site which one you
5:06
choose will depend on your technical skills and the level of access you have
5:11
to the website you'll also need a free Google account if you use Gmail you
5:17
probably have one of these already in this lesson we'll look at how to get a site verified and the steps to take
5:25
right after so let's Dive In
5:33
first go to search. google.com/ search console click on the
5:38
blue start now button then log into your Google account or create one you'll now
5:44
see the welcome to Google search console splash screen if you are already logged into your Google account you'll be taken
5:50
straight here on the welcome screen first choose the property type you want to verify domain or URL prefix this
5:59
deter detes the verification methods available to you out of these two property types domain is more powerful
6:06
as it will show you how Google sees your URLs across your different subdomains and protocols by protocols I mean HTTP
6:14
or https for example if you verify the domain example.com you'll be able to
6:22
access search console data for HTTP example.com https example.com and any
6:30
subdomains on the other hand URL prefix limits you to a single domain and
6:36
protocol if you verify https example.com you won't be able to access data on URLs
6:43
beginning with HTTP example.com or any subdomains but there's nothing stopping
6:49
you from verifying multiple URL prefix properties this could even be a useful
6:55
way to manage access if you have colleagues or Partners who only need to work on a specific subdomain the
7:02
downside of the more powerful domain approach is that it only gives you one verification method DNS
7:10
verification this involves adding a record to your DNS configuration depending on your setup you may need to
7:16
do this through your domain name provider such as GoDaddy or your website builder such as Wix studio if you don't
7:24
have access to your DNS configuration you'll need to use the URL pre fix
7:30
approach instead here you have a choice of verification methods in addition to
7:35
DNS uploading an HTML file to a website that's Google's recommended approach
7:41
adding a meta tag to a website's homepage a metatag is a small piece of
7:46
information about a site like a label using a Google analytics account or
7:52
using a Google tag manager account if you aren't sure how to upload an HTML
7:57
file or add a metatag it's worth checking whether your platform CMS or site Builder offers any tools to make
8:04
this process easier for example Wix Studio has a site verification manager
8:09
where you can paste in the metatag and it will automatically be added to the
8:18
site whatever verification method you choose remember that you'll need to leave it in place even after
8:26
verification for example if you upload a metat tag removing that tag later on
8:31
will cause you to lose access to that property in search console for that reason it's a good idea to verify your
8:38
site with more than one method if you can once you've verified your site it can take some time perhaps a day or two
8:45
for data to become available in search console so if you can't see anything useful straight away you don't need to
8:52
worry and if the site itself is new there may be no performance data at all to start with but this will rectify
8:59
itself over time as you create more content for Google to crawl and the search engine learns more about the site
9:06
now you know how to verify a site with Google search console and what happens after in the next lesson we'll look at
9:14
performance reports so you can understand how content is performing in Google search and how to optimize
Performance reports
9:26
it now that you have a site verified in search console let's turn our attention
9:32
to its reports perhaps the single most important section in search console is
9:37
performance this gives you the data to understand how a site's content is performing in Google search and how you
9:44
can optimize it in this lesson we'll dive into the performance report section
9:49
identify key metrics and talk about how to use search filters and export data
9:55
let's take a look
10:02
depending on the site you'll either have a report called search results within a
10:07
performance section or a report that's called performance immediately below the overview two different names for the
10:15
same report whatever it's called click on this report and you'll see a table of all the search queries your website's
10:21
ranking for in other words the keywords and phrases the users type into Google
10:27
for which the site appears in the search result this is the data for my personal site where I write marketing how-to guides so
10:35
most of the queries relate to problems that my guides solve for example how to
10:40
see exact number of followers on Instagram that's something I've written about at the top of this report you'll
10:46
see four metrics total clicks total Impressions average CTR or click-through
10:53
rate and average position and actually you'll see these metrics throughout search console here's what they mean
11:00
total clicks that's the number of clicks through to a page from a Google search results page and that's clicks on
11:07
organic results so not paid advertising total Impressions the number of times a
11:13
page from the site has appeared in Google's organic search results average CTR your average click-through rate as a
11:21
percentage if you get one click from 100 Impressions your CTR would be 1% average
11:28
position your average position in Google organic search results with one
11:33
indicating the first or top result the lower the number the better by default
11:38
only total clicks and total impressions are selected but you can click on the other two average CTR and average
11:45
position to add them to both the table and graph on this page the tabs just above the table let
11:52
you swap from a list of your top search queries to a list of your top pages with the same metrics clicks impressions and
11:59
so on and you can even click on a page and then sort back to the queries tab to see which queries that page is ranking
12:11
for at the very top you have your search filters you can change the search type
12:17
here so if you want to know how a site is performing in Google Images or Google news this is the place to go you can
12:25
also change the time period by default this report only data from the last 3
12:30
months but you can change this to a maximum of 16 months and that's the case
12:36
for pretty much all the reports in search console the date range filter also lets you compare one time period
12:43
against another a super useful all if your client's business is seasonal for example a retailer selling Christmas
12:50
trees would expect relevant search phases to have high volumes in December but low volumes in July so they might
12:57
want to compare this December against December last year be careful though because search consult only retains data
13:05
for the past 16 months this means you won't be able to compare the most recent
13:10
full year against the previous one in any of search consoles reports as that
13:16
would require at least 24 months of
13:23
data if you want to review search data systematically you can export it to
13:28
Google sheet or download it as an Excel or zip CSV file do this by clicking on
13:34
the export button to the top right of the report and selecting your preferred option this will give you up to a
13:41
thousand rows of spreadsheet data which you can sort and filter exactly as you wish and potentially build into your
13:47
keyword research plan or SEO report for example you might want to look at queries where you're getting clicks but
13:54
your average position has fallen perhaps the page is generating those clicks would benefit from a Content update to
14:01
push them back up to their previous [Music]
14:08
position there are two other reports in the performance section discover and
14:13
Google news they follow the same format as the search results report but they
14:18
focus on other sources of traffic the Discover report shows you traffic from Google discover which is a personalized
14:25
content feed available in the Google mobile app the Google gole news report shows you traffic from news.google.com
14:32
and the Google News app on Android and iOS but not from the news tab in Google
14:38
search you'll only see these reports in search console if you're getting traffic from discover or news if they aren't
14:45
listed it means they aren't traffic sources for your client's site now you know what to find in the performance
14:52
reports of Google search console in the next lesson we'll go over how to use the
14:57
URL inspection
URL Inspection tool
15:04
tool for a web page to appear in Google's organic search results three
15:09
things need to happen first the page needs to be discovered by Google that is
15:15
Google has to know the page exists then it needs to be cwed by Google this is
15:21
where Google sends its bot to read the content and finally it needs to be indexed by Google Google decides that
15:28
the page is good enough and unique enough to show in search results let's say you have concerns or questions about
15:35
one particular page on a client site has it been discovered crawled indexed to
15:42
answer that you'll want to use search consol's URL inspection tool in this
15:48
lesson we'll look at how to use the URL inspection tool get to know how Google
15:53
discovers a page and how to find out when Google last called one we'll also look at how to use the test live URL
16:01
option which lets you see a page as Google sees it let's jump
16:10
in here we are in search console paste the Page's URL into the search box at
16:16
the top to start the inspection process wait while Google retrieves the data about the page from its index it can
16:22
take a few seconds you'll then see the status of the page this page has been indexed great but there's a lot more
16:29
more information available to you if you click on the page indexing section to expand it let's look at two pieces of
16:35
information in particular how Google discovered the page and when Google last called the page how Google discovered a
16:43
page is useful if you've spotted some URLs in search console that you feel shouldn't be there just pop one into the
16:50
URL inspection tool and you'll find out whether Google discovered that page through an XML sit map a link on your
16:57
client's site a link on an external site or some other way sadly it's not unusual
17:03
for spam websites to link to non-existent pages on a site that can cause these madeup URLs to appear in
17:10
search console it doesn't mean there's a problem on your client's site or that you have malware using the URL
17:17
inspection tool can put your mind at rest here when Google last called the page is useful information for a
17:23
different reason let's say you updated a page one week ago but the URL inspection tool tells you that Google last called
17:30
it 3 weeks ago that means your most recent changes won't be reflected in Google search results and you might be
17:37
missing out on traffic as a result what you can do in this scenario is use the button at the top of the URL inspection
17:43
report to request indexing here you're asking Google to revisit the page and CW
17:49
it again to index the latest version you can do this for brand new pages as well
17:55
as updated ones bear in mind though that as the buttons says this is just a request making the request doesn't
18:02
guarantee that Google will crawl your page anytime soon and if it's a new page
18:08
there's no guarantee that Google will choose to add it to its
18:16
index the test live URL option lets you see a page as Google sees it which is
18:22
not the same as how a human sees it click on the button to run the test the test can take a minute or to once it's
18:29
complete click view tested page to view the page either as HTML or as a
18:35
screenshot this can be useful for identifying any parts of the page that Google can't or won't crawl one question
18:43
that comes up in SEO circles sometimes is whether Google can see content rendered by JavaScript the short answer
18:50
is yes but this tool is a good way to put your mind at rest if you have any concerns as part of the live test you
18:57
can also see if Google was unable to or chose not to load any page resources
19:03
click on more info and then page resources to see what Google hasn't loaded in this example Google hasn't
19:11
loaded the analytics code or the advertising code for the site neither of these would be needed by Google bot
19:17
they're not content that you would want to be indexed so there's no problem here
19:22
now you know how to use the URL inspection Tool in Google search console for troubleshooting problem problems on
19:29
individual Webb pages in the next lesson we'll look at the page indexing report
19:35
which can tell you about issues that affect groups of pages or even an entire site and how to use it to identify and
19:44
fix
Page Indexing report
19:50
problems if you saw the lesson on Google search consoles URL inspection tool you
19:55
now have a handle on troubleshooting problems on indiv idual web pages but that tool won't tell you about issues
20:02
that affect groups of pages or even an entire site that's where search
20:07
console's page indexing report comes in in this lesson we'll look at what the
20:13
page indexing report is some reasons why Google doesn't index pages and when to
20:18
take action you'll find the page indexing
20:26
report under indexing pages is the graph at the top shows the number of pages on
20:31
a site that are and aren't indexed underneath that is a breakdown of the reasons why Pages haven't been indexed
20:39
and the number of pages affected by each reason under the source column you'll see that some of the reasons are marked
20:45
Google systems and some are marked websites let's look at the reasons that
20:51
may not need action versus reasons that may need action if a reason is marked Google systems it relates to Google's
20:58
behavior and may be out of your control but if a reason is marked website this
21:03
is a possible action for you as Google says you should fix the issue if it makes sense to do so if it makes sense
21:11
is a key Point here in many cases it's fine for URLs not to be indexed for
21:16
example this site has a lot of pages with redirect that relates to redirects
21:22
I've added or that my CMS is added for me automatically when I change the url
21:27
it's nothing to worry about because I don't want Google to index the old URL I only want it to index the new one that
21:35
means I don't need to take action I've also got discovered currently not
21:40
indexed these are pages that Google is aware of but hasn't got round to crawling unless you're managing a huge
21:47
site something like a a major e-commerce website with thousands of uncalled Pages
21:53
this isn't anything to worry about either and a third reason I can see here is excluded by no index tag the no index
22:01
tag is a small tag you can add to a page to tell Google and other search engines not to index it this isn't a technical
22:09
problem but do check to make sure you haven't accidentally no indexed a page
22:14
that you do want to appear in search results you might for example have added
22:20
the tag when you were working on a new page and it wasn't ready for Google but then forgot to remove it now let's look
22:26
at three reasons that may require some attention or action on your part firstly
22:33
not found 404 this is an error indicating that the page couldn't be found on the server if you've moved the
22:40
page you should put a redirect in place if you haven't moved it or deleted it
22:46
there may be a technical issue with the site the next one is duplicate without
22:52
user selected canonical that means Google sees this page as a duplicate of another page and
22:58
is showing that other page rather than this one in search results you can delete one of the duplicate Pages or add
23:06
a meta tag called a canonical tag to tell search engines which one is the main version and finally redirect error
23:15
this can happen when you have a long chain of redirects or perhaps two pages that are both redirecting to each other
23:22
creating a redirect Loop to fix this you'll need to break the loop or reduce
23:28
the size of the chain for example you might have page a redirecting to B B to
23:34
C and C to D you could get rid of all of these redirects and instead redirect a b
23:41
and c directly to D Google has published a full list of reasons why it might not
23:48
index a page on its search console help
23:56
websit even when the the page indexing report does indicate problems bear in mind that this report isn't in real time
24:04
it lists issues that Google found when it tried to crawl the site's content not
24:10
necessarily errors that affect the site right now to put it another way the
24:15
report could include problems that have already been fixed by the time you come to look at it for that reason it's
24:22
really worth digging into each issue to see whether they still need to be tackled click into any of the listed
24:28
reasons to access a graph of the number of pages affected over the past 90 days
24:34
and some examples of the affected Pages you might immediately spot a pattern
24:40
perhaps those 404s all relate to blog posts or to tag Pages here for example
24:46
all the pages that are cwed currently not indexed on my site are feed Pages
24:51
for specific categories I don't want those pages indexed anyway as they don't have unique content once you know which
24:59
section of the site is affected and when the problem started or at least when
25:04
search console detected it it will be much easier to see whether it's still an issue identify the cause and should you
25:12
need to fix it if you're sure an issue has been resolved the next step is to
25:18
ask Google to validate fix by clicking the button at the top it will then schedule a recall but it's worth
25:25
repeating that not every reason listed in this report report is a problem and not everything will need to be fixed now
25:33
you know how to use the pages report within the indexing section of Google search console in the next lesson we'll
25:40
turn to another report in this section the sitemaps
Sitemaps report
25:50
report in the previous lesson we looked at the pages report within the indexing
25:55
section of Google search console now let's turn to another report in this section the sitemaps report actually
26:03
this is both a report and a tool because it lets you submit an XML sitemap and
26:08
then monitor its
26:14
status an XML sitap is a document that lists the websites Pages or at least the
26:21
ones you want search engines to crawl and hopefully index without a site map search engines will still try to find a
26:27
site's Pages by following internal and external links that is links on the site
26:34
and on other sites but a site map can help them with that Discovery process it can also help them to understand when
26:41
existing Pages have been updated and might need to be recalled XML sitemaps shouldn't be confused with HTML sit Maps
26:49
which are web pages that list the categories and topics covered on a site these are mainly intended to help human
26:55
users of a site rather than search engines so how do you get an XML sitemap it's
27:02
likely that your website platform or Builder will be able to generate one for you either as part of its core
27:08
functionality or through a Plugin or extension being an XML file the address
27:13
should end in XML once you have that address enter it into search console
27:19
sitemap tool and click submit you can submit more than one
27:24
sitemap if for example you're using domain verification in search console
27:29
and each subdomain has its own sitemap alternatively your platform might give
27:35
you a sitap Index this is an XML file listing lots of different sitemaps
27:40
perhaps one for posts one for category pages one for tag pages and so on you
27:46
can submit your sitap index in the same way as a regular sitap this enables
27:51
Google to find and read all of the site Maps listed in your index
28:01
so that's how to submit your sitemaps but what can Google search console then tell you about your sit Maps the report
28:09
lists all of your submitted sitemaps and sitemap indexes when Google last read
28:14
each sitemap the number of pages Google discovered and whether Google encountered any problems with the
28:20
sitemap if there are no problems with your sitemap search console will show the word success in green under the
28:27
status column but it could show you one of two red status messages instead couldn't fetch or has errors couldn't
28:35
fetch means that Google wasn't able to retrieve your site map at all perhaps you entered the wrong URL for example
28:42
has errors means that Google fetched your sit map but either couldn't read it all or couldn't crawl all of the URLs
28:51
perhaps your site map is empty or perhaps the formatting is wrong if you see either of these red stat messages
28:59
click on your sit map to get more information about the specific problem once you fixed the problem resubmit the
29:05
sit map to Google search console you can also click into a sitemap index to see
29:11
the same information for all the sitemaps that it contains if you find that Google is not discovering a lot of
29:18
your URLs you should first check that your site map has been submitted to Google search console you should then
29:24
check that there are no errors or issues with your sit map you can do both of these in the sitemaps report now you
29:31
know how to use the sitemaps report in Google search console in the next lesson
29:36
we'll turn to the experience reports see you
Experience reports
29:45
there in this lesson we're looking at Google search consoles experience reports these reports provide a summary
29:53
of a sites user experience as Google understands it this isn't just about
29:59
user experience though it's also key to good SEO in other words providing a bad
30:05
experience could hurt a site's rankings its traffic and ultimately its
30:10
conversions we'll now dive into the first experience report page experience
30:17
this is an overview that shows What proportion of your URLs are good that is
30:22
offer a good user experience based on two things core web vitals and http yes
30:28
and there are separate more detailed reports for both of those
30:36
areas if a page passes core web vitals and is served using https rather than
30:43
HTTP Google considers it good but what are core web vitals there are a set of
30:49
factors that Google believes are particularly important to user experience they measure real world user
30:56
experience based on three factors loading performance interactivity and
31:02
visual stability loading performance is measured with a metric called largest
31:07
contentful paint or LCP simply put this is how long it takes for the Page's main
31:13
content to load interactivity is measured with interaction to next paint
31:18
or inp this is a new metric introduced in March 2024 inp is the time between
31:25
the user interacting with a page clicking a button for example and the page updating visually visual stability
31:33
is the most interesting one have you ever been on a web page and you go to click when suddenly something loads on
31:39
the page then the whole page shifts around and you end up clicking on the wrong thing usually an ad that's what
31:45
Google means by visual stability and it's measured with a metric called cumulative layout shift or CLS the less
31:53
shift the better the core web vitals report in search console shows the number of URLs or pages on a site that
32:01
are good need Improvement or up all according to these three metrics are
32:07
some of your URLs failing to hit the good rating click on the open report link alongside either the mobile or
32:14
desktop section to see the reasons why for example this site has an issue with
32:19
LCP loading performance on every page on mobile that suggests the problem isn't
32:24
with individual pieces of content with how the site as a whole loads it may be
32:30
worth looking at the page templates or considering caching to improve site
32:39
performance the final report within the experience section is https this shows
32:46
you how many of your index URLs are https and how many are just HTTP the
32:52
https protocol is better both for user security and for ass SEO Google has
32:59
confirmed it is a ranking Factor so if you have HTTP Pages showing up here it's
33:05
definitely worth diving into this report to find out why it could be something as simple as an invalid certificate or
33:12
perhaps you're missing redirects from HTTP to https now you know how to use the
33:19
experience reports in Google search console in the next lesson we'll cover
33:24
the enhancements reporting section [Music]
Monitor rich results
33:32
in this lesson we're looking at the last of the four main reporting sections in search console
33:38
enhancements by enhancements we mean features on a site that use structured data so that could be breadcrumbs videos
33:47
search boxes a forum and lots more besides let's Dive In
33:57
what is structured data it's a standardized format for providing
34:03
information about a page and the page content for example structure data for a
34:08
video could contain information about the video's upload date expiry date
34:14
duration and contents through a description or even a transcript that's
34:19
all information that Google wouldn't otherwise be able to get by crawling a page with an embedded video on it so you
34:26
can see how structured data can help Google and other search engines
34:31
understand a page in much greater detail this in turn can make a site eligible to be shown in enhanced search results also
34:39
known as Rich results structured data may sound technical but there's good news your
34:46
platform or site Builder or even well-written thirdparty plugins may add
34:51
it to your client Pages automatically Wick studio for example implements
34:56
structured data market up on blog posts product pages Forum posts and event
35:02
Pages by
35:08
default search consoles enhancements reports are the place to see whether your pages contain any features with
35:15
structured data you'll have access to a different report for each enhancement that Google has detected on your site on
35:23
the other hand if there aren't any enhancements you won't see the section in search conso at all this site has
35:30
breadcrumbs site links search boox and videos with structured data let's click
35:35
into videos in the individual enhancement report search console will also flag up any errors it has found in
35:43
your structured data implementation these could be critical issues in red
35:48
which is when your structured data is not valid or they could be improvements in yellow which is when your structure
35:55
data is valid but could benefit from extra information to make it even more informative for example this site has
36:02
one potential Improvement to make I could add a time zone to the upload date
36:07
property if your structured data does need a fix this may be something you can tackle yourself or it may be something
36:15
you need to raise with a plug-in or theme developer via a support request for example when the fix is done click
36:22
into the item in search console and click on the validate fix button this will prompt search console to check
36:29
again now you know how to use the enhancements section in Google search
36:34
console see you in the next lesson where we'll turn to the links
Links report
36:43
report we've looked at the four main reporting sections in search console
36:49
performance indexing experience and enhancements there are a few reports in
36:55
search console that fall outside these sections but that doesn't mean they're not useful in this lesson we focus on
37:03
one of those extra reports the links
37:10
report the links report isn't mentioned in the search console overview but you
37:15
can find it in the main menu just above settings so links as you probably know
37:20
are hugely important to Google and to other search engines not only does
37:25
Google follow links to discover new content it also sees them as an important ranking Factor links pointing
37:33
to a page can tell Google that the page is valuable of course links from some
37:39
sites carry a lot more value than links from others here in the links report in search console you can learn about the
37:45
links to a site that Google is aware of there are four sections external links
37:51
your pages with the most links from other sites you might know these links as backlinks or inbound links internal
37:59
links your pages with the most links from other pages on a site if a page
38:05
doesn't have any internal links it won't be listed here even if it's indexed by Google this sort of page is called an
38:12
orphan page and they can be hard for users and search engines to find top
38:17
linking sites the sites that are linking to you the most you might be able to
38:23
find some potential Partners contributors advertisers or customers depending on the business model by
38:29
looking through this list top linking text the most commonly used anchor text
38:35
in backlinks to a site by that I mean the specific words that are turned into a link for each of these sections click
38:43
on more to see a full list of pages link metrics export options and search
38:48
filters or click on a page to see the individual links into that page it's no
38:54
surprise that my homepage my about page and so on have the most internal links
39:00
after all they're linked to in my main menu which appears on every page my category and tag Pages appear quite high
39:07
up the list too it's good to link posts to structural Pages like these both to
39:12
help users to navigate a site and search engines to understand it so this search
39:18
console report does have its limitations it doesn't show historic
39:23
data or changes over time you can't tell whether your new links or when Google
39:29
first detected a link and remember links aren't all equally valuable a link from
39:36
an authoritative site such as bbc.co.uk will help you much more from
39:42
an SEO standpoint than one from a smaller or less trustworthy site but search console won't give you any
39:48
insight into how it values various external links to do that you'll need to
39:54
use a different tool that estimates how author ative different sites are link
39:59
Explorer from MOS is a good example of a tool that does this now you know how to
40:05
use the links report in Google search console and what kinds of links to pay
40:10
attention to in the next lesson we'll dig into the Cru stats
Crawl Stats report
40:20
report in this course we've talked about how Google first discovers a page then
40:26
cwls it and and then hopefully indexes it but Google will only allocate a
40:31
certain amount of resources to craing a site that means Google bot that's
40:36
Google's crawler will only crawl so many pages of a site in any given period of time that's called your cruel
40:45
budget if your client's site is small then this isn't really a concern but if
40:51
your client site is large it's then something you may have to think about and even optimize
40:57
by larger site I mean tens of thousands of pages especially if they're updated
41:03
regularly for sites like these a craw budget is important because it affects
41:08
how quickly Google will pick up any changes made to a site and that affects
41:14
how quickly SEO improvements will generate results to understand how a
41:19
cruel budget is being spent you'll want search consol's Cru stats report let's
41:25
take a look
41:31
because it's aimed at Advanced users the crawl stats report is one of the most hidden reports in search console it
41:38
isn't listed in the main menu you'll find it under settings scroll down to the crawling section and click open
41:46
report this report shows Google's crawling history on a website over the past 90 days the number of C requests
41:53
it's made the average response time from its server the server responses it's received and so on for now let's focus
42:01
on the server responses this can help you understand if there's an issue with craw health for this site Google bot is
42:08
spending most of its time crawling pages that do exist that's see okay2 200
42:14
server response is what we want to see but if all your craw budget was being spent on Google crawling pages that are
42:20
not found that's the 404 server response then that might be a problem by the way
42:26
you can click on any of these responses to see some example Pages if you want to investigate further average response
42:33
time is also important this is the time it takes for a CW request to retrieve the content from the site you can add
42:40
this metric to the graph at the top of the report by clicking on it the lower the response time the more quickly
42:47
Google can craw the site and the more pages it can craw with the resources allocated to you so a fast site can help
42:54
you make the most of your cruel budget but there's an even better way to increase your call Budget and that's to
43:00
increase the user value and uniqueness of the content on a site create a site
43:06
that people want to visit and Google will want to CW it now you know how to
43:11
use the craw stats report and with that we've now gone through almost all the reports in Google search console in the
43:18
last lesson we'll go over how to connect search console with Google analytics for
43:25
[Music]
Connect to GA4
43:30
in this final lesson we're going to look at connecting search console with another free Google tool Google
43:37
analytics 4 or ga4 this unlocks new reports in G4 and lets you see search
43:43
console metrics such as search Impressions right alongside ga4 metrics
43:48
like conversions but first what's the difference between search console and G4
43:54
they both give you insight into a site's performance and help you make website and business decisions but the data they
44:01
provide is quite different but simply search console as we've covered in this
44:06
course is an SEO tool that tells you how Google Sees the site it's focused on
44:12
organic search performance on the other hand ga4 is an analytics platform that
44:18
tells you what people do on the site it's focused on user activity bringing
44:24
the two together can be extremely powerful so let's dive
44:33
in so I've already verified my site in search console and set up my Google
44:38
analytics 4 property here I am in G4 to link it with search console I do the
44:44
following go to admin under product links click search console links click
44:50
links choose from my list of verified search console properties click confirm
44:56
click next select the web data stream for my site click next finally click
45:12
submit once I've done that I can enable or publish to special search console
45:18
reports in G4 click on reports in the G4 menu click on library in the collection
45:25
section find a collection called search console click on the menu icon the three
45:32
dots for this collection select publish after a few seconds a new
45:38
section called search console will appear in your ga4 reports menu if you
45:43
expand this you'll see your two new reports queries and Google organic
45:50
search traffic the good news is that these reports will show data straight away going back to when you verify the
45:56
site search console or created your G4 web data stream whichever happened more
46:07
recently here's what the two new reports give you queries this shows your organic
46:13
search queries along with number of clicks Impressions CTR and average search position the four key metrics we
46:21
saw in search consoles performance reports the report lets you Wrangle the data in slightly different ways in
46:27
search console for example you can produce a graph of organic search clicks
46:33
over time broken down by device category desktop mobile or tablet whereas search
46:38
console would just give you the headline figures for that as a table Google organic search traffic this
46:45
report shows your landing pages along with key search console metrics and some
46:51
ga4 metrics like average engagement Time Event count and number of conversions
46:56
having this data side by side is really insightful after all what's the benefit
47:01
of a particular page performing well in search if it isn't generating any engagements or conversions now you know
47:08
how to connect Google search console to Google analytics 4 and the new reports
47:14
that connection gives you stay tuned for a recap on what we learned throughout our search console
Wrapping up Google Search Console

47:37
connect to and verify a site through Google search console getting familiar with all the useful reports it offers
47:44
all the way to connecting to Google analytics 4 which we also have a course on here in Wix Studio Academy now you
47:51
can analyze a website in so many ways and make sure it's performing as well as it possibly can thanks for following

0:13
some real world examples it's a howto utilizing actual websites real examples
0:21
that will be actionable in order to help clean up messy links how to spot
0:28
problems inside of search console before they actually become real issues on top
0:33
of that we'll do a brief walkthrough of GSC look at the link link types ways to
0:39
identify some problems on top of that I'll show you a third-party tool that can help with your analysis and then
0:46
I'll walk you through the disavow tool so I don't want to waste any time let's get into it all right so let's go ahead
0:53
and just swap screens over like this and I'll share with you a couple examples all right so first and foremost uh
1:00
welcome to Google search console if you have never ever if you've never utilized
1:08
Google search console I highly suggest that you run out and go and get it it's complimentary it's free it works most of
1:16
the time the data is pretty darn good I mean it's right from Google super
1:21
helpful it's complimentary if you don't have it go to Google and type Google
1:27
search console all right just like this what you'll look for is this uh right
1:32
here Google search console you'll sign up all you simply have to do is add a
1:37
easy and quick uh verification either to DNS or to your homepage it's simple but
1:43
we're not here for that I'm here to Showcase to you ways to identify some issues all right so I want to point out
1:50
this is a uh company that I've worked with numerous times I was looking for someone else but this one showed up
1:56
first so here's the one that we'll utilize all right this is tropical skips he uh offers uh Skips a skip is another
2:04
word for like a dumpster but in Australia great guy with that being said as we scroll down the page here I want
2:11
to point out some functionalities all right so first and foremost we have our overview we have our performance tab all
2:17
right and the this is definitely considered a web master tool you operating and working on your website
2:24
you're now a Web Master right I never looked at it that way but that's what it is all right now as we're looking at
2:31
performance and URL uh inspection I really want to get to a specific part of
2:38
identifying an issue before it becomes an issue I want you to take a look down at the bottom of the page here all right
2:45
you'll see a tab that says links inside of this particular section this is back links or link building these are
2:52
external votes that come in all right on top of that Google inside of search console will also help you identify your
2:59
internal linking now internal linking is very important to tell Google or help Google understand what you deem to be
3:07
important all right but what we want to look at right here is going to be external links so that's links going out
3:14
and then top linking sites so as we take a look at this particular element or
3:21
this block this widget within GSC I want you to take a look at each of these
3:26
websites now in this particular instance I don't see anything that's going to be
3:31
out of the ordinary however if you start seeing a magnitude all right of a bunch
3:38
of a bunch of sites kind of like this all right so this is skip compare.com
3:44
auu this is a directory I know that this link shouldn't be you know malicious in
3:51
any type of way however if you're seeing a bunch of links coming into your
3:56
website from the same site and there's a lot of them and you don't recognize it
4:02
this can potentially start to be an issue now what I want to point out and what you're not seeing here is a piece
4:09
or a part of a backlink which is called anchor text anchor text is to give
4:15
context to the actual hyperlink what's a hyperlink see this URL right here this
4:21
is an actual hyperlink in order to help Drive context to the actual link or to
4:27
the vote coming to your website business own owners or you know linking websites
4:32
are going to put anchor text okay with that being said if you're in competitive
4:38
markets or perhaps who knows uh maybe you started ranking really quickly or there could be
4:45
any type of reason if you start getting links out of nowhere that you don't recognize I want to walk through the
4:53
process of how to use another third-party web master tool in order to identify an issue right just like this
5:01
and on top of that how to fix it so let's walk through that now all right so inside of search console we have this is
5:07
our first line defense and what we walk through real quick here um just in case you're just joining me this is a stream
5:14
uh we went to links and we're like wait a minute I'm seeing a bunch of links on my website I didn't build them they're
5:22
showing up they're all from the same website we better take a deeper Dive Right This is the first line of defense
5:29
with that being said all right if you scroll down just a little bit you'll have this you have to click on it but I
5:35
want to utilize a third party tool to really showcase this to you all right the third party tool that we're going to
5:41
utilize and we're going to look at a different site is going to be semrush
5:46
all right now I want you to take a look at this particular anchor text this is
5:52
the anchor text tab under backlink analytics all right now come on over uh come on back come on back over here all
5:59
right right I I want to point these pieces out to you all right because I
6:04
want you to completely understand the scope of anchor text and the context that it passes and why this can be an
6:12
issue but first we need to understand the different types of anchor text right so let's take a look here visit website
6:19
www view website these types of anchor texts are what is called generic they're
6:25
not really passing much value however often times directories citation PR tons
6:30
of different sites utilize these all right a link is a link and it's still passing value but not as much value as
6:37
one would like with that said I want to go ahead and show you a few more we're going to scroll down our list here as
6:43
you can see here if this actually contained the colon forward forward slash and also the other slashes within
6:50
the parameters of the URL this right here would be called a naked URL
6:56
non-derogatory it's just what it's called all right as we keep going down the list here we can see that here's
7:02
another one all right and here is some of the seos perhaps maybe you're an SEO
7:09
this is some of our favorites all right now I want to showcase this to you K's skip bins this is an exact match this
7:18
particular key term if if we were to go to I'll show you this KS uh skip bins all right I think my
7:27
guys ranking number one or number two let's take a look here okay hey serps
7:33
fluctuate with that being said we're Page One Number Four at this time uh
7:39
what he's actually going for is Skip bin higher card in any case it's a partial
7:45
it contains the primary key term you get the point here you get the picture it's in the title tag it's in the H1 it's
7:51
actually a lot of those words are in our name with that being said this is what
7:56
the page is optimized around so the anchor text or the link that's being
8:02
sent to me is hyper relevant right I'm trying to pass as much value as possible
8:08
with that being said let's go back over here we know that this is an exact match all right this here is a naked and this
8:15
is a generic then often times you will start to see in different types of serps
8:22
there's what is called Advanced anchoring all right you can call it whatever you'd like you're you're not
8:28
going to see this on a skip bin site you generally see this in high competition
8:34
markets like law or real estate in big cities where it's really hard to rank you want to get as much bang for your
8:41
buck especially if you're buying links now sometimes and this is what I want to
8:46
uncover with you sometimes these links could be used just like we have a good
8:51
thing sometimes these could be perceived as a bad thing especially as volumes start to increase I want to point this
8:58
out to you all right remember uh we just went through generic naked all right and
9:03
we also talked about exact match now I want to point out a little bit more of an advanced anchoring strategy okay
9:11
let's take a look here as we take a look at these particular anchor texts remember we are inside of Sam Rush
9:18
taking a good look at my friend Thomas Matthew Thomas Matthew's been in business for a pretty long time all
9:25
right on top of that he does all of these Services I want to point out but
9:30
with that being said take a look at the different anchor text all right these anchor text are going to contain key
9:38
terms that are hyper relevant to him on top of that sometimes you're going to
9:43
stack or utilize Advanced anchoring techniques in order to maximize value
9:49
and alleviate utilizing or getting a penalization by over optimizing your
9:56
anchor text what do I mean by this well if a primary key term is TV media wall
10:02
cabinets all right a way to get more key terms in there or to make this link even
10:09
more relevant is by adding location modifiers so if you take a look here you
10:14
can see we have our TV wall and cabinets TV wall units two separate types of key
10:20
terms on top of that two locations I believe this is the county Andor the
10:25
state on top of that a neighborhood you with me we've maximized our anchor
10:32
text however we're going to go through a few more but I want to point out from
10:37
beginning until end a way to identify with Web Master tools first line of defense and then I'll walk you all the
10:44
way through on how to fix a potential issue all right so as we're
10:50
taking a look here at our Advanced anchor text we can see that we have quite a few of these types of links now
10:57
I want you to take a look over to the right hand side here at this particular column this is backlinks now there's a
11:05
massive difference between a referring domain and a backlink all right a
11:11
referring domain is the initial vote this is what actually matters how many
11:17
unique referring domains you have drastically can impact your overall
11:23
performance with that said we can see that there are 193 unique domains
11:30
that are utilizing this exact anchor text but on top of that there's
11:36
743 backlinks so that means that these 193 sites used this term more than one
11:44
time on the page as an anchor text this could be an issue right now why is this
11:51
BEC the primary reason is you're not maximizing value of a referring domain
11:57
unless it's pointing to multiple pages on top of that overutilization of
12:02
primary key terms inside of anchor text can lead to a
12:08
penalty furthermore all right if you have a website where you have a primary
12:14
service all right let's say that your primary service is actually doing kitchen cabinets or Cabinetry or maybe
12:22
it's I don't know ciling fans if you have a primary service but you're you
12:27
have an overarching of amount of anchor text coming in for secondaries it can
12:32
shift what Google thinks your website's about or at least the pages that it's pointing to you with me so I want to
12:40
point this out to you let's come on over here together all right I just want to give you a little bit more of an
12:46
explanation this way if you see this you can nip it in the bud Pronto all right
12:53
again stick with me I'll walk through the entire process just bear with me here my drawing skills might not be the
12:58
best but I'll try all right so I want to point this out if you have a main website all right so you have a website
13:05
this is your homepage we're going to call this home all right on your website you actually
13:11
do three different things all right you only do three Individual Services let's
13:17
say for instance that you do kitchens right you do
13:22
bathrooms and on top of that you do bedrooms all right we're just using this
13:28
as an example with that being said as a secondary service or as an add-on or a second
13:35
thought right we often times we'll offer other services because sometimes it's an
13:41
upsell for our customers right or whatever the reason may be with that said you might have something where
13:46
you're doing your primary service which is bathroom but then you have these secondary small Services right I
13:54
generally don't set up sites like this but some business owners do now with
13:59
this being said we have this page here that's going after bathrooms all right
14:06
we have these sub services that are you know uh let's say it's TV uh media right um and I don't know
14:15
picture hanging right I'm leading to a point here so our top level page the
14:21
page that's most important to us we're optimized around bathroom and bathroom
14:27
fixtures uh bathroom renovation we'll say all right but as our secondary
14:33
Services we're doing TV we're doing wall mounts we might do installations who
14:38
knows the there's Endless Possibilities the problem with the anchor text and what we're uncovering
14:45
together is this all right so we have our top level page that's hyper
14:50
optimized okay but let's just say for instance that we are building links to
14:57
our bed page all right so this is all about uh bedroom Renovations or bathroom
15:03
Renovations in this case it's bedroom renovation but people are starting to
15:10
build a thousand anchor texts to this page that contain the T the
15:21
word okay and then bath okay and then on top of that
15:29
let's throw a location UK all right this is the anchor text but wait a second I
15:37
thought you said that this was the bedroom page exactly you see when you're
15:42
doing your analyzation or you're setting up your markers or you're watching certain
15:49
identifiers it's to the untrained eye this isn't going to trigger a response
15:55
why I'm getting backlinks in the back Lings aren't perceived as negative
16:01
they're not showing up as spammy at the end of the day they're probably not that harmful in fact some
16:08
of them might actually be powerful the problem or the rub here is
16:14
that we are sending irrelevant anchor text from irrelevant category websites
16:23
yes they might be okay they're not harmful they're not spam sites they're not malicious they're not trying to
16:29
install anything but the relevance that I'm passing is not relevant at all I
16:36
cannot build Authority I cannot build trust I cannot say that I am the most
16:42
authoritative figure in this particular market and the relevance which mind you
16:48
relevance equals rank that's coming into the site is going to the wrong pages in
16:53
high volumes with exact match anchor text all right if enough of this happens
17:00
where I have mismatched anchor text in high volumes especially exact match this
17:07
can start to drag down my primary
17:13
pages right because clearly this can't be the authority they can't be trusted
17:18
how how could they be the expert right we have a relevant links coming in and
17:24
on top of that we didn't mention the type or the category or the link graph
17:31
of the backlink and I hope that you're with me here because this can be massively impactful to your overall
17:37
search performance all right so let's let's put a pin in this we're going to come back but I want to point out the
17:44
next element that's massively impactful now when you're in a particular industry
17:49
all right you can see up here every site does this this even Google does this the
17:56
originator of classification of website is Google 80% of Google's overall
18:03
revenue is based upon ads right so inside of their ad platform if you go
18:09
and take a look like we think search Google's thinking ads right that being
18:15
80% of their overall business they have taken it upon themselves to identify sites based on a
18:23
magnitude of things one of them is traffic and user Avatar the other piece is going to be the referring domains the
18:31
link graph what links are connected in the link graph this is how Google was
18:38
built right so with that being said Google started this the tools the webmas
18:45
tools that I'm showcasing to you this is semrush I showed you search console there's Majestic there's MZ there's atrs
18:52
and I'm sure there's a bunch of others with that being said this category isn't specific to semrush it's specific to
19:01
Google it matters to Google so it matters to us and it matters to
19:06
semrush they've identified the primary category as construction and
19:12
maintenance correct when you take a look at your referring domains I want to point this out to
19:18
you all right when you're taking a look at your referring domains there's what is called
19:25
or at least I call your top five categories all right all right categories are
19:31
what votes external votes am I inside of the link graph do I
19:37
look like a winner or not do I have the same type of links it doesn't have to be the exact same links but am I in the
19:44
link graph like my top competition yes or no am I getting links from the same link graph from the same category so
19:51
when we take a look at our top five categories utilizing a web master tool
19:57
such as semrush we come down here and we take a look at our categories Information
20:02
Technology advertising and marketing construction and maintenance online services retail mass and
20:10
education okay now that you have walked through
20:16
classification of Link let's go back to our example all right we know that the
20:22
site has been identified as a construction and maintenance and yes
20:27
there is a magnitude of these types of links coming in all
20:32
right in order to rank inside of a category they're going to have more than one type of Link coming in just like
20:39
there's a a bunch of different intents in order to serve websites right with
20:44
that being said I want to show this to you all right let's go back to the issue at hand now all
20:50
right we know that in order to be a winner the primary category is
20:55
construction and maintenance also furniture online services retail and I
21:01
think online okay now let's look at our results
21:07
remember potentially malicious potentially not it could be any reason
21:13
that this could happen but it cannot happen to you or to anyone because we're
21:19
going to be able to watch it right so here's what you're going to be watching for so we see our thousand links that
21:25
have came in we take a look and we our antennas haven't gone up because the
21:31
anchor text is right and the sites don't look malicious however with more
21:37
understanding now a much more indepth understanding of how Google works and how backlinks work and what a link graph
21:43
is we now know that wait a second the category of Link that's
21:51
coming in even though it's from a decent site and even though the anchor text is
21:57
relevant over all right it's not going to set off any alarms it's not going to look crazy to you it's not going to jump
22:03
off the page but when you take a deeper look you can see that wait a second we
22:09
have a relevant anchor text going to the wrong pages and on top of that we can
22:15
also identify that the category that's coming in is
22:23
for I'm just using this as an example education when I I take a look at my
22:29
leading top 10 or top five or top three competitors their top five category of
22:36
Link that's coming in none of them say education so wait a second somebody has
22:42
taken it upon themselves all right to not necessarily on this site but this
22:49
kind of jumps off the page but I want to point this out so somebody has taking
22:55
heavy exact match anchor text that's a ding right off the bat right like that
23:01
could potentially lead to a penalty check ding the next thing is is they've
23:06
built 700 so numerous on the same referring
23:12
domains this can be perceived as a link Network ding right it's two strikes the
23:20
next thing is is the category of link is not the right
23:27
category I'm not in the right link graph so technically speaking even if the website looks good and the content looks
23:34
good even if the title tag and the anchor text are hyper relevant if it's
23:40
the wrong category in time if there's a lot of this built it's going to be
23:46
detrimental to My overall performance why because I'm changing what Google thinks my website is about if I change
23:54
relevance as rank if Google cannot identify or understand what my site is
23:59
about and remember Google is built on understanding websites based upon other sites that are in the link graph or are
24:05
linking to you and out external too right so when we take a look we have a
24:11
thousand links wrong page wrong anchor text on top of the wrong anchor text
24:17
it's entity Rich it's keyword Rich ding ding ding that's three and they're in
24:22
the wrong category then as you start to build over time and you start looking you're like wait a minute
24:29
they've done this one time two time three times four it's like a song four
24:34
times five times six times and more what they're
24:40
doing is slowly changing the
24:46
relevance of your overall sight and they're doing it right in your
24:56
face so shall we move forward there's two things
25:01
that you can do see I'm a firm believer in negative in negative out right I'm
25:06
not going to show you this I'm I I'll tell you and you can make your decision
25:11
for yourself one way to combat this is through what is called
25:18
the HTA access file all right if you're utilizing WordPress I believe what 40%
25:23
or 60% of the web is so you're probably utilizing WordPress or some type of
25:28
system that you have access to an HTA access file or a file that you're going to serve right with that being said you
25:37
always have the ability to it's not a 301 but it's like
25:43
a 301 and you can send that link right back to where it came from on top of
25:49
that you can block out what is called C classes of Ip often times when you start to see
25:55
this type of strategy they'll use utilize what is called a subdomain and if you're not sure what a subdomain is
26:03
let me go ahead and just Enlighten you since we're on a roll here all right if you see stuff like this this is
26:09
oftentimes unskilled um spammers will do this type of thing so we'll say it would
26:15
be something like this um kitchen do
26:22
uh metric Farm I don't know do cn.
26:28
K right it would be something like this so when you take a look at it it'll be
26:34
this all right https colon SL SL all right now the subdomain is this here all
26:43
right so it will show up as a unique backlink which means it's going to pass a unique anchor text which means it's
26:50
passing even if it's a garbage website even if it's a zero Dr or zero Authority
26:56
I'm still passing relevant through anchor when done in high volumes right
27:02
this can be a problem see these subdomains are easy to set up there's
27:08
softwares that do it and each of these backlinks that are made on a subdomain even though it only counts as one
27:14
referring domain with enough anchor text I can change the relevance of the site that I'm pointing to all right with that
27:22
said this is a subdomain okay now like I mentioned to you there are there are
27:27
ways to well there's three ways all right you can either almost like a 301
27:33
you can figure it out for yourself but you can send the link back you can also do this by blocking out IP blocks or
27:41
cclass ranges could just send the link right
27:47
back I that's not what I would do right that's fire with fire and I think
27:52
negative in negative out what I would do is I would take the reasonable approach
27:57
and we're going to walk through utilization of a web master tool an advanced Web Master Tool uh that is
28:03
called the dout tool so let's go ahead and utilize that together now and I'll walk you through how to create a disal
28:11
file all right so what we're going to do here is we're just going to use our friend here all right um and what we're
28:18
going to do together is we're just going to take just a couple so we're going to do an export all right and I'll walk you
28:25
through the process of I'll walk you through the process of
28:30
creating a I'll walk you through the process of utilizing Web Master tools to
28:36
create a disavow file that you can then upload through Google search console
28:42
another web master tool all right did I say Web Master tools enough yet I was trying I'm trying my hardest
28:50
all right in any case we're going to come on down here we did a export all right and if you're utilizing this
28:57
particular tool which which is called semrush the export functionality is right here if you're doing everything
29:03
inside of search console again they will have a export functionality which is
29:08
right here all right so let's walk you through the process of creating the disal file and how you can find the
29:16
option to utilize this Advanced functionality all right let's go ahead and do that together so the very next
29:22
step that we're going to do is we want to take a look and I would recommend once every two weeks to 30 days it's
29:29
completely up to you generally when we're doing page refreshes right this is a reoptimization of the page the
29:36
internal linking which pages should we reoptimize or take away or what should we add you know we're just reanalyzing
29:43
the website right that's what web Masters do uh what we generally will do is we will just take a look at hey how's
29:50
the backlink performance what's indexing what's not are we get anything that's you know what's out of the ordinary
29:56
right so you can do it on any cycle that you would like if you're in a high competition Market or you've had issues
30:04
in the past I would recommend every two weeks to 30 days but generally realistically we do it every 90 days
30:11
when it's page refresh time quarterly all right so we're just going to go ahead and move forward here we are going
30:17
to analyze and then develop our uh disavow file all right very simple thing
30:24
but if you've never done it I'll walk you through that now all right so let's go ahead and do This Together uh we are
30:29
going to get our export which is going to come to us in two separate formats um I believe both
30:38
GSC and semrush HR I think all of them really it's either going to be CSV or an
30:44
Excel file all right so what we're going to do here is we will grab our
30:50
file all right once we grab our file here we will
30:56
bring it on into to uh what is called Google search uh Google Drive all right
31:03
now you don't have to use Google Drive you could use whatever you would like okay I'm just talking while I'm clicking
31:09
what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and bring up our um file here all right now what we want to
31:17
do then is we want to take a look at our anchor text okay and we want to make sure that
31:24
we get the entire export so I'm glad that we were able to do this together my mistake so let's make sure that we get
31:31
the entire thing so we want to go to backlinks once you're on your backlinks
31:38
then you want to go to export all right and we'll go to excel my mistake all
31:44
right the reason for this is very simple uh we want to make sure that we can get
31:51
oh even better there's a text document we want to make sure that we could get everything together all right
31:58
so we're going to go ahead and do this I'm not sure what this is but that's cool we're going to make this now so we
32:04
want to come over here to our file folders bear with me we are going to
32:11
drag this in once we have drugged this in we will
32:16
pull it up we're going to go and click on it it should open up inside of Google Sheets I'm I'm a big fan of Google
32:23
Chrome now what we're looking at here is this is the authority score all right this is the source page okay and then
32:30
here's our Target Target means the where the link is pointing to all right now
32:36
with that being said we're going to come on over here all right source title this is fine
32:43
take this here we will delete this column we can clean up this column you can do this any
32:50
way that you would like um but here's our source URL we can delete so now we
32:57
have our page and then we have our anchor text now we're looking for a
33:03
specific type of anchor text right we're looking for stuff that's not pointing to
33:08
the right Pages now I'm not going to sit and do this because for in this particular instance we don't have an
33:14
issue but I was pointing out certain things but what I do want to show you is how we can develop this file together so
33:21
what I like to do is don't leave any leniency don't leave any openings and
33:28
what I mean by this is if you see a malicious site with malicious intent
33:33
even if it's not perceived malicious at of first glance for instance let's take
33:39
a look at a page that's like this so we have a bunch of these wacky looking websites like I mentioned subdomains
33:46
right we take a look at these over here and we can see that this is going to a short wardrobe page low ceiling attic
33:54
wardrobe right short wardrobe so this is Anchor specific even though they're
34:00
stacking the anchor text and it is pointing to the correct page but for
34:05
instance this anchor text is wrong and it's pointing to this page let's just
34:11
say right hypothetically I'm saying this is wrong it's pointing to this page this
34:17
page is about wardrobes but this were this was going to say uh
34:23
kitchen banister installs right
34:29
um you know kitchens London right something like
34:35
this and however when you look at all the other ones you're like wait a
34:41
minute five of them are completely wrong but five of them are actually helping
34:46
and then on top of that the authority scor is a 13 it's not that bad no no
34:54
don't leave any room if you see something with malicious and you did not
34:59
build it it's out of there so what I would highly recommend is you can grab your list like this all right and then
35:06
there's lots of tools I'm sure you might have some on your machine already if you have apple or a PC but let's just say
35:13
you don't you want a fast easy way to sort through this here's what I would recommend come on over here to Google
35:20
and you can search for a um online tool free right that's how you lead in and
35:27
what you're looking for is remove duplicate uh domains all right so here's
35:36
what it is so URL list cleaner tool perfect we're going to go to it enter your URLs to clean so this is perfect
35:43
it's going to take care of everything that we need so first and foremost what we want to do is we want to trim to root
35:50
well why do we want to do that Chris because again if we identify a malicious URL it's out of there I'm going to stri
35:57
break it down utilizing the disavow tool or at least I'm going to say hey Google take a look at this if we'll talk about
36:06
the next process but let's keep looking here now that we can see here we have a magnitude or a multiple of sites now y's
36:14
a a good site again there's nothing wrong here I'm just utilizing this as an
36:19
example and a walkthrough okay but as we're doing this we're going to trim to root trimming to root just takes us down
36:26
to the domain level because number we just want to get them out of there the next step is let's remove the duplicate
36:32
URLs now we have a fresh clean list the very next step that we want to go ahead
36:38
and do is we want to take our list all right if these are all out of there I
36:44
mean this particular site was building links like family handyman Forbes Jabra
36:51
yel the kitchen the spruce this guy's been doing some horal
36:56
link building uh but with that being said what we can do is we can grab our
37:02
list we're going to cut we're going to head right back out to
37:07
Google gee I've never done this before it's just so fluid isn't it like it's almost like I've done this 9,000 times
37:15
all right uh the very next thing that we want to do is it's going to be free
37:21
online tool right and what we want to do is
37:26
add a a word to a line all right what
37:32
we're going to look at here we this one's fine we're going to paste our original text all of them work pretty
37:38
similar um a lot they do it for you know ad bucks so you're always going to be
37:44
able to find an online tool even if you don't find this one in any case we put our original text the next step is going
37:50
to be uh add text to the beginning so what you want to do is you want to type
37:56
domain colon all right just like this and
38:02
then uh let's get rid of this ad up there it is execute all right now we put
38:09
domain colon we're going to do a copy all right and then what you want to do is you actually want to create a text
38:15
document you can name your text document whatever you would like but for this particular example we are going to save
38:22
it as all right example
38:29
disavow 111111111 right save the very next step
38:35
is we're going to need to be logged into our Google account that we are also the
38:43
owner or admin of our Google search console all right so make sure that
38:48
you're inside the account that owns or operates your gsse account all right so we're going to look up Google search
38:56
console all right make sure that you know find it go to it and make sure that you log in the very
39:03
next step is once you've identified that you're inside your account maybe you only have one account I have a bunch of
39:09
accounts so I always find myself doing this so I shared it with you the very next thing that we want to do is we're
39:14
going to look up dis thou tool all right you can do this from inside of GSC but I
39:21
want to give you a a streamlined approach all right we hit enter the very
39:26
next thing we want to do is you're going to come down here to this particular option here disavow tool in search
39:32
console and this is the screen that's going to come up disavow links to your site if you have a manual action or if
39:39
there's unnatural links or if there's an issue that you've identified and remember just because a tool says oh
39:48
this is a bad link or just because you know your best friend Ralphie said that
39:54
this is a bad link you know Google is the end decider but
40:01
the elements or the factors that I helped you identify together anchor text
40:08
the amount of links or the amount of referring domains the page that it's pointing to and the category in which
40:16
that link is coming from these are the identifying markers on top of that
40:22
another element to look at all right since we're going to right before we submit this I I want to make sure that
40:30
you know there's a big yellow caution Google doesn't usually do this
40:36
right there's a giant yellow caution for a reason so I just want to stress you
40:41
you don't know it's helping or hurting but if it's clearly identifiable that hey this is a problem then I would like
40:48
for you to proceed with your disavow let's point out really quick though
40:53
before we do this together let's point out just one more time what we're looking for all right so let's head on
40:59
back over here and again we're going to utilize a third-party tool a web master
41:05
tool in order to come up with these equations I'm just going to give you the factors quick all right first and
41:10
foremost is referring domain is it a unique referring domain is it just one
41:16
referring domains are the initial vote backlinks are you can build a 100
41:22
backlinks but it's only one referring domain all right did you build it or someone else someone else built it we
41:29
have to take a look next what we want to take a look at is we want to see how
41:35
many backlinks are being built from a particular domain like we identified
41:42
inside a GSC when we come in and we take a look at something like
41:47
this um bear with me here one second let's go to backlinks all right
41:54
when we scroll down here we can see all right we can see this right here look at
42:00
this um let's just say that it was this one B2B if
42:06
B2B has built a thousand links back links not
42:11
referring did you build it yes or no if there's more than one what is the point
42:17
unless it's pointing to multiple Pages or you did it so we're looking at the Domain we're then looking at how many
42:24
links did it send me right the next element that we want to take a look at is this one right here which is
42:31
called external links so if a domain has an authority score again this is not
42:37
Google's metric it's Sam Rush's metric they have an authority score of 48 but
42:42
there is 225 external links on that
42:47
page you know let's just say that each link going out counts for a point well
42:53
they're we're at a deficit if there's 225 outbound links on that page the
42:59
possibility the probability of that link being valuable is highly unlikely right it's already evaporated
43:07
all of the link juice or you know all the page rank is gone it's gone right so
43:14
with that being said we want to look at overall backlinks how many referring domains the next thing is how many
43:20
external links are on that page because if you're going through and there's not a problem of a bunch of links but you're
43:25
looking and you're like huh look pretty good but there's 12,000 external links on this page all going to different
43:32
sites that are probably not in the same category you might want to think twice all right the next thing that we want to
43:39
take a look at is going to be well what type of link is it but this is less
43:45
important than the actual category of link again you need to identify who the
43:52
primary winners are in your space the next thing you need to identify is well what category what link graph are they
43:59
in so when we do this we click on this filter here we go to our category and we can see inside of semrush all the tools
44:06
do this you can look down the list okay the winners are in these categories so anything that doesn't fall in these top
44:13
five top seven categories I it's technically not as relevant as it could be okay so now
44:22
we've identified links referring domains external links and on top of that we've
44:27
also identified the actual category this is one of the most important factors
44:33
category the next element is the power of the link how many referring are
44:38
pointing to that site then it's how many external links are on that site okay I'm
44:44
just giving you power now okay last but not least all right let me
44:50
point this out to you the anchor text of the link all right what does it say does
44:57
what it say what does what it say does what it say does what it says is it
45:03
pointing to a relevant page yay or nay right it does it say cats but it's
45:10
pointing to a dogs page you know you have to you have to identify this so
45:16
what I'm getting at is these are key factors no matter who you ask right the
45:22
referring domain count how powerful is it what level is it at what's the category where does it link from is it
45:27
an image link is it a comment link is it ugc like there's a bunch of little factors to tell you and help you
45:35
understand if this is actually a quality link right just because a tool says it
45:40
or your friend says it or this says it or I just don't like the name no but if you identify that it's a bad or a
45:47
malicious link or if it's not helping Propel your business to the top it's out
45:52
of there so now that we've gone through these steps together I want to take you back to the disavow tool to catch you
46:00
back up to speed if you've just joined me uh remember we've exported our list
46:05
we then went to I went to multiple different online tools in order to trim to root to get to The Domain we want the
46:12
domain because I'm just going to block the whole domain if I identify that it's junk it's junk and I don't want to block
46:18
Pages I'm gonna because they'll just keep building I'm gonna block the whole domain all right with that being said
46:24
we've created our list after we cre created our list we've appended domain
46:29
colon in front of each hyperlink whether it's https or HTTP protocol after that
46:37
we're going to name it and then we're going to make sure that we're inside of our Google search uh Google search
46:44
console admin uh Google account it's a lot of Googles the next thing that we
46:50
want to make sure that we're doing is after we've identified all this is we're going to select our property okay the
46:56
property being the website that you're uploading your disavow link to or list to and sometimes if you've done this
47:04
before you're going to see a it'll show up underneath like right here and it'll
47:10
say hey um here's your last dis Val list and it'll say a date all right what I
47:16
would do is I would probably download that list get those links because if they were bad then they're probably bad
47:23
now just append them to your new list and then upload your brand new list all
47:28
right and these are the steps from beginning until end to do SEO
47:33
optimization by making sure that there's no bad backlinks pointing to your
47:39
website and it might not be easily identifiable at first glance but once
47:46
you have truly identified a malicious or bad link that's trying to shift
47:52
relevant this is one of the steps that you can take on top top of that here is
47:58
a quick little bonus all right um how to
48:04
block uh entire cclass of
48:09
ips from linking to my website okay I'm not gonna I'm not going
48:16
to give you a walk through on Advanced um white hat tactics right um this is a
48:25
way to just block like if noticing that it's all diff it's all different websites or all different subdomains but
48:31
it's you know these these spammers are relatively cheap right um they're going
48:38
to use the same IP range just block that range all right be careful though that
48:43
they're not using some type of CDN again that's why I'm not giving you the full walkthrough because it's outside of the
48:49
scope but hey if you have to this is available block the whole cclass another
48:54
way to do it I'll give you one more bonus all right uh another way to do it is uh how
49:02
to um how
49:09
to send
49:14
a how to how about this how to block a backlink source in my HTA access file
49:25
all right there's a name for it it and there's a procedure for it but this should get you on the right track there you go uh rewrite condition directive to
49:33
check the referring domain yada yada then use a rewrite rule to send a response code like forbidden if the
49:40
referring domain matches one of the blocked ones all right again this is another way you could just it's kind of
49:47
like a disavow uh but it's you will host it on your own site you would just say hey I'm not taking credit for that
49:54
there's also another way to just send it right back back to him okay um I hope
49:59
this has been helpful for you uh my name is Chris Palmer with Chris pal.org soon

52:00
though to win but don't quote me on that in any case Thomas the
52:06
Train Thomas Thomas the Train Thomas the Train says oh look at that green that's
52:13
pretty cool that's neat all right here's what we're going to do all right we're going
52:20
to finish this off with some hey do you like how I put the you like this you see the outline you like that right I
52:26
changed the color fancy fancy schmancy all right
52:33
anyway sometimes I'll talk people you're not very uh what's the word um it doesn't matter Thomas the
52:41
Train says should authoritative outbound links be du follow I think that's
52:48
entirely up to the Web Master um if you're going to link to something from
52:53
your website as the Web Master why wouldn't it be do follow see the no
52:58
follow and follow directive is from the Web Master to say I either trust or I do
53:04
not trust where I'm sending my visitors if I'm sending someone off my trusted
53:09
https website it's your website your baby it's right it's your in a lot of
53:16
it's like your life it's like a piece of your life right so I'm on my website
53:22
it's kind of like uh would would I send my son with somebody if I didn't trust
53:30
them right it's the same with your website like you have a website I'm
53:35
sending them off my website to a link that I placed and then I'm going to have the audacity to write no follow hey I'm
53:41
going to send you here but I don't trust you I don't trust this person that much you know see I think there's a you said
53:48
authoritative link so that means you placed it and you're pointing to a statistic or something that is going to
53:54
add value to your customer or to your visitor right that's why you're sending them there why else would you do this so
54:02
and I'd like to overe explain stuff uh Thomas I think I know who you are um I
54:09
I'm pretty confident but I think you know I like to over explain um but that's the that's the answer all right
54:16
it if you're going to send them off let's make sure it's due follow um or don't send the link now with that said
54:23
if there's user generated or ugc content right say you have a forum or a blog or
54:29
there's a section in which you'll allow the usage of hyperlinks those are all no
54:34
follow why because it's been identified within the code that it's user generated Andor it's a blog or comment section or
54:41
a forum right then you you know I I feel as though that that's within the
54:47
guidelines and two when you go and take a look at Google has a Blog um inside their blog not on every
54:55
post but on some posts there's capability to logged in users to leave comment they're no following U they'll
55:01
ugc a particular section inside of a not it's not a div but they'll outline a
55:06
section this is ugc and then they know follow any of the links if there are instances of links all right there you
55:14
go what's up Chris Johnny good to see you brother South
55:22
Carolina I will do a much deeper dive now excellent section for your course course something we all encounter good
55:28
stuff yes sir my pleasure uh zanette hello Chris hello to
55:35
you good sir everything you have taught me has overcome Such trivial stuff but nice to
55:42
have in my back pocket every tool matters in SEO everything I've taught
55:48
me has overcome such yes oh all right that's my call I out of
55:56
here I'm going to bust through these questionss I got a run I'm going to see Sonic um uh you're the best thank you
56:03
very much so are you I appreciate your time uh white hat tactics nice of course
56:09
uh super white hat I'm white hat you didn't know wow loving the bonus tips Chris my
56:15
pleasure um yes I and I you know I'm more in the
56:22
gray area um so yeah that's that the man
56:27
thank you sir I TR one of them hey Chris from Ked hello to you kind sir I like
56:34
that picture uh he is laughing on the
56:41
floor okay thank you is it normal to see a drop in Impressions and clicks after
56:46
CH changing schema type from organization to educational Organization
56:52
for an educational blog that is a very particular question um but with this being said uh
57:01
isn't a wouldn't the hierarchy of schema and
57:07
correct me if I'm wrong I'm not 100% but when the hierarchy of
57:12
schema include uh web page website you
57:17
know you're marking up elements wouldn't the educational organization be a type
57:23
of organization so wouldn't it be organization that is a educational
57:29
organization and then you would name people place the map and all of those details if if you're ever unsure of this
57:36
type of thing there is a hierarchy this was taught to me by Clint Butler you know this was in
57:43
2016 I saw him speak and he was teaching me about schema um well Advanced schema
57:49
I knew the basics uh and he was the first po person to point out to me uh hey you got all
57:56
the schemas but they're all jumbled up you know there's actually a order a
58:02
hierarchy of importance and this is the way that you do it kudos to you Clinton
58:07
so the hierarchy and if you go to schema.org it will lay out the hierarchy and I believe that the educational um
58:14
schema type is is nested within organization so both now to address the
58:21
second part of your question uh that
58:27
that's highly unlikely but you never know I do you have events on your page
58:33
is it a page that's getting cashed or crawled that gets a lot of traffic is there video on that page you know
58:39
there's sometimes there's elements or you know depending on your website if you're getting a boatload of
58:45
traffic you know making a a a a change
58:50
can cause a dramatic effect temporarily right but in most cases as or taking
58:56
away schema isn't going to really have that much impact um but there are some use cases that I've seen it cause
59:03
trouble right so there you go or or help uh for instance I have a gentleman we run his
59:11
Maps he's a he's a pressure washing company he's in Long Island in any case
59:16
just recently we modified his homepage and we added schema for two days maybe a day he went
59:26
from number 47 we're not doing the web work by the way uh just Maps uh he went from 47 to
59:34
position two and not even for the primary it's the variation power washing as opposed to pressure but then it
59:41
dropped right back down but I think it started ranking slightly higher anyway I digress let's keep moving on I don't
59:49
think it's going to cause you Pro problems my friend Zane is
59:54
laughing EXC excellent I'm coming I'm
1:00:03
coming ah here give me a sec
1:00:49
going to see Sonic baby what we've been waiting for this here's
1:00:55
what's crazy uh fun fact so I've never seen a toy roll out like the Sonic roll out
1:01:02
generally toys come long after a movie comes out for instance Paw Patrol toys
1:01:09
will come out generally two to four weeks after the movie right and that's blastmaster like they're they've been
1:01:15
doing toys forever when that Barbie movie came out they didn't launch that toy line from that new movie it was like
1:01:23
45 days in you're probably wondering Chris why are how do you know these things I watch
1:01:28
these things it's I'm I'm a weird guy right I watch these types of things and
1:01:34
marketing things intrigue me but in any case this was a new type of marketing tactic the last time I saw this
1:01:39
marketing tactic done or uh what's the word laid out like this was with Power
1:01:46
Rangers huge success right so they rolled out the toy
1:01:51
first right um and then they laid out the full feature movie now obviously
1:01:58
Sonic has movies and games and he's a well-known character I don't know if this would work with a new character but
1:02:05
the last time I saw it done like this was Power Rangers and it was boom like they had the toys and the and the hats
1:02:11
and the posters and everything from the movie but the movie's not even out well done Sonic well done anyway moving on
1:02:20

2025 is a strange year for SEOs. The prediction of SEO's death has been going on for the past 25-26 years.
0:06
But now a lot of new words have come to take the place of SEO. Like AIO, AEO, GEO, LLMO, HEO, HEO.
0:15
Now the new people who want to come in this industry, they are thinking whether to learn SEO or not.
0:20
And the old people are thinking what to learn, learn AIO, learn AEO, learn GEO, who should I learn?
0:26
Google itself does the work of putting ghee in this fire. Which gives the answer to any question as if you have asked the way of salvation from a saint sitting under a peepal tree.
0:35
It depends. I mean, crossing the road also depends on looking around three times.
0:41
But uncle, show the children the right way, you must know everything. So to remove all this confusion and to straighten the boat of SEO for you, we are bringing a complete SEO course during the time of AI, which will teach you how to rank the website on Google, will also teach you how to rank on ChatGPT, will also teach
0:58
you how to get a mention in AI mode, how to do a lot of SEO tasks using AI, like how to write content using AI, how to audit a website, how to do competitive analysis, how to search keywords, how to make a report.
1:10
Yes, all these things can also be done with AI. All these things will become easy for you.
1:15
And this time, we are bringing this course here on this YouTube channel. That is, it is going to be free.
1:21
Now what is the reason for this? I have just explained this in a community post. Those who are interested in knowing the reason, they can go and read the reason.
Should You Learn SEO in 2025?
1:28
And those who only want to eat fruits, do not want to care about seeds, they can continuously watch this video. So the length of this course will be around 4 to 5 months.
1:36
We will upload 2 to 3 lectures every week. Each lecture can be from 30 minutes to 60 minutes.
1:42
And all the topics will be explained to you in detail in a minute.
1:48
So if you have not subscribed yet, then subscribe and also press the All button.
1:54
Otherwise, YouTube will use its brain. And you will get some notification and some not. Your course will remain incomplete.
2:00
What is that course in which there is no doubt solving? So we will do a live session for doubt solving every Sunday.
2:06
But this live session will be only for members. Because if I do a live session on the channel, normally I keep it open, then those people can also watch, who are not interested in the course source.
2:16
So a lot of comments will keep coming. Your useful students' real questions will be suppressed.
2:21
So the doubt solving live session will be for members only. But there is no problem in that.
2:27
Because the membership fee is 29 rupees. You don't get 2 samosas for 29 rupees. So join the membership from now.
2:33
And get ready for the live session. Now if you want to take advantage of this course, then while starting every lecture, first of all, you have to take out the free time around you. Don't get disturbed in between.
2:44
Take out the time from 30 to 60 minutes. Sit comfortably with a notebook so that you can keep making notes.
2:50
And note down the questions you get, so that you can ask them in the live session.
2:55
Okay? There may be some crowd in the live session. So keep your questions ready in advance, so that you get a chance to ask your questions.
3:01
And I can answer you. You get the full value of your course.
3:06
Yeah! Now it will be fun, bro! Those who are new in this industry, and want to come in this industry now, they will get confirmation from today's video, that they should learn SEO.
3:18
Whether this industry is for you or not. And those who are coming to this channel for the first time, I will give my introduction to them.
3:23
My name is Amit Tiwari. I am a technical SEO. I mostly work in e-commerce, news, SaaS, healthcare industry, etc.
3:30
Apart from this, local SEO is my passion. So you will see a lot of videos related to local SEO on this channel. I have been in this industry for about 14 years.
3:37
So I have seen the Penguin update, Panda update, I have seen BERT's Uthal Puthal, I have seen HCU.
3:42
This AI time is also passing by. So I have seen a lot of such things. And your anxiety in this industry, AI or anything related to it,
3:51
I will calm it down. I am sure. So let's start. 🎵 Intro Music 🎵
Course Structure & How to Make the Most of It
4:03
Those who are experienced, may find this part a little boring. But do watch it.
4:08
I will recommend that you watch this part completely. Either you won't get information, or you won't get jokes.
4:13
So, let's come to SEO first. So, the full form of SEO is Search Engine Optimization.
4:19
But its actual meaning is Optimization for Search Engine. But has anyone ever said SEO? And we are so innocent that we are still using SEO.
4:28
We should have done OSE a long time ago. But it is what it is. Search Engine Optimization is wrong because we don't optimize search engines.
4:37
We optimize our web pages for search engines. So our acronym should have been OSE, but we are using SEO.
4:45
Now, I won't tell you about AIO, AEO, GEO, etc.
4:50
Before that, it is very important for us to take a bird's eye view of SEO. After this, I will come to all these acronyms.
4:56
And you will understand everything. It won't take much time. Once the base is covered, you will understand all these things above.
5:02
Now, there is a normal belief that a true SEO is the one who gets a small amount, and ranks any small website on number one in Google for any query. That too overnight.
5:12
But this doesn't happen. It doesn't happen in any industry. Getting a website ranked on Google is a small part of SEO's job.
5:22
And when most SEOs start ranking their responsible websites on Google, they start making mistakes from there.
5:29
If you want to learn SEO, it is very important to understand the work of SEOs logically. And to do SEO, to do search engine optimization, it is very important to understand the work of search engines.
5:40
So a modern search engine works in 5 steps. Number 1, discovery. Number 2, crawling.
5:46
Number 3, rendering. Number 4, indexing. And number 5 is ranking.
5:51
Ranking is a part, but it is the fifth part. Let's understand them one by one. The first part is discovery.
5:58
That is, the search engine should know about your URL from somewhere.
6:04
That is the discovery part. You made your website. Let's say you made 100 pages on your website, or 1000 pages, or 100,000 pages. How will Google know about these pages?
What is SEO? A Bird’s Eye View
6:14
No one can remember all the pages of your website. You will not remember the address of all your pages either.
6:20
And we should somehow provide this entire URL list to Google. Google should know from somewhere that these are the pages on this website, so that it reads the content of those pages and sends it to a user who is searching your page.
6:36
When will this happen? When Google will know about all your pages. So this part is discovery.
6:43
The second part is crawling. That is, when Google finds out that there are 100 or 1000 pages on this website,
6:49
Google's bot, an automated program, comes and visits all those pages of your website.
6:57
This part is called crawling. Now, the third step is rendering, which is a part of crawling.
7:03
There are millions of websites on the internet, and they are built on a lot of different platforms. Some are normal, simple websites that are built on HTML.
7:10
Some use JavaScript. Some are based on PHP. And all these websites with different designs, different infrastructures, different hosting, and different designers,
7:21
Google's bot, the automated program, has to go and read them. And the job of reading the website on the browser is called rendering.
7:32
It's a very simplistic explanation. This rendering process is very important because if your website is visible to normal people, but if Google's bot can't see it properly, then Google's bot won't be able to understand your website nor will it be able to rank it for any query.
7:48
So this rendering process is a little technical, but it's very important. And if the rendering is hampered in any way, if the rendering is not successful, then your website won't be able to rank.
7:58
The fourth step is indexing, which means Google's system understands your website, understands its content, renders it, and then after this, it thinks that your website's content can be shown to someone in the future.
8:13
That's why it saves a copy of it. This process is called indexing.
8:18
If Google doesn't know about a website's pages from the first step, that is, from discovery, it can't crawl it, it can't render it, then it will never index it.
8:27
After indexing, the fifth step is ranking. That is, Google shows your website's pages to another user in the search results that whatever query you have done, the related information is here on this web page, go and read it.
8:42
This is the fifth ranking part. So if I miss one, two, three, four, these four parts, if I don't focus on it, if I don't complete all these steps, will it rank?
8:54
Never. Because SEOs are based on search engines, so we optimize our websites for these five steps.
9:02
If you normally search for a free SEO course on YouTube, then you will be told directly, look, do this, do that, then this page of your website will start ranking for this keyword.
9:10
And then the second chapter is that if the website doesn't rank, then see if the index has been done or not.
The Five Fundamental Steps of Search Engines
9:16
This whole process is being taught to you in reverse, that's why there is a loss. If the whole game is reversed, then there will definitely be a problem.
9:23
So if you want to do SEO, then you have to optimize your website for all these five steps.
9:30
So in the step of discovery, we do a lot of good to the structure of our website.
9:35
We ensure that one page of the website is connected to the other page. We provide a map of our website to Google from our side, which is called a site map.
9:44
And we constantly keep in mind that all our new pages, their URL, their address, they are constantly updated in this site map.
9:53
And Google also goes and sees that page. The second step is crawling, in which the job of SEOs is
10:00
We test these pages ourselves to see if these pages will create a problem in crawling through Google or if we have blocked a Google bot or any search engine bot.
10:10
If we don't open our door, how will anyone come in? The bot won't break the door. It's not a mercy. Okay. So, we ensure that all the URLs of our website can be crawled properly.
10:20
When a bot is trying to crawl our website, it shouldn't happen that our hosting, the server on which our website is hosted, slows down, doesn't give the page, doesn't block a Google bot or any other bot, etc.
10:34
There are a lot of checks that we have to perform on our end. The third step is rendering, in which we check whether the page of our website is visible to the Google bot or not.
10:45
We have made the website and tested it with our own eyes to see if the website is visible to the Google bot or not. But the Google bot doesn't come to your website. It's a program and it has to render your website.
10:56
It has to execute that code. If for any reason it can't see your website properly, it doesn't complain to you that it can't see your website.
11:05
It assumes that there is no content on your website. Your website is useless. So, to stop this kind of misunderstanding, we, the SEOs, have to go to the website and check whether all the pages of the website are visible to the Google bot or not.
Discovery: How Google Finds Your Pages
11:19
After this comes the part of indexing, in which we try to convince the Google bot that the content that we have written on our website, on each page, all those pages are correct, useful, the content is very useful and you should index this page.
11:34
If the Google bot doesn't index our page for any reason, then we try to find out the reason for it.
11:40
And after finding out the reason, we remove that problem and again request Google to index our page.
11:46
Apart from this, the SEOs have to check whether all the pages on our website are indexable or not.
11:52
If any page is not indexable, then we hide it from the Google bot so that the Google bot doesn't waste its time in trying to crawl or index it again and again and also doesn't waste the resources of our hosting.
12:02
If a page is actually indexable, but still the Google search engine is not indexing it, then we add more value to that page so that Google indexes that page.
12:11
And when we do all these four steps properly, then the SEOs, the good SEOs, the SEOs who are doing all the four processes properly, they don't have a problem in ranking.
12:21
And even after following all these four steps properly, if the pages on our website are not ranked, then we study different algorithms and try to rank our pages using the knowledge that we have developed based on our understanding.
12:35
Basically, we explain to Google that our page is good for the query of the user who is coming to Google. You rank it.
Crawling: How Bots Visit Your Site
12:44
So, traditionally, the five steps of search engines are based on the five tasks of SEOs. But apart from this, there are three more parts of SEOs.
12:54
So, there are five and three, eight total duties. You have seen five. After this, we come to the sixth, which is content creation.
13:01
There should be some useful content in all the pages on the website. Only then will that page help Google in recommending further.
13:10
If there are not many pages on your website, then what interest will Google have in ranking your website?
13:16
Let's assume that your company has five services. You made a homepage on your website, a about us page, a contact us page, and made five different pages for five services.
13:26
This is a very good thing. But now, why will Google rank your website? Because you are giving information about your product, your service.
13:34
If someone combines your company's name and service and asks, this company is giving this service, what is its page?
13:42
Then it is possible that Google will show your page in front of you. But if someone comes to Google and queries a keyword related to your service, then why will your page be ranked?
13:51
Because you do not want to give any information to the user. You just want to tell about your service. So, when the user asks about your service, then Google will tell.
14:00
But if he wants information related to the service, then Google has no reason to rank your pages.
14:06
So, that's why we create content on our website in different ways. And this content is not just a blog post.
14:12
My students know that a blog post should never be made by any business owner. You have to forget the blog post if you want to move forward in this course.
14:20
If you think that if you don't make a blog post, then how will you rank your website? Then you will get the answer in the coming chapters.
14:26
Now, whether we write this content ourselves or we get it written by someone else or it is AI generated, whatever it is, we have to approve it in some way.
14:33
We SEOs have to handle this process. The seventh step is analytics.
14:39
That is, you have to collect all the data on your website from different people, different search engines, different keywords, and different pages.
Rendering: Visibility Issues for Bots
14:50
And then you have to analyze it. Analyzing means we see how much traffic our page is getting, what kind of people are coming from which country on that page, what kind of queries are coming on those pages.
15:02
So that we can analyze those queries and see whether they are related to our business or not. Is it that you are selling a comb and your website is ranking for some other product?
15:14
So we see whether the keywords on which our website is ranking are suitable or not, whether they are reasonable or not. If they are, then how do we increase them and if they are not, then how do we remove those unuseful keywords from our website.
15:25
We do all this analytics work. And the last duty that comes after this is reporting.
15:32
That is, we have to prove the work that we have done in front of the client.
15:38
You are not breaking free bread, you have to prove it. One thing you tie a knot. I have 14 years of experience.
15:44
When the client's business does well, the reason for his success will be the blessing of his parents, the support of his wife, the hard work of the staff, the gift of God.
15:54
There will be a bedsheet on the shrine, there will be bread for the black dog, there will be water in the urn. Everything will be responsible for his success.
16:01
But when the business does not do well, then only the marketing person will be at fault. And the biggest mistake in that is the SEO.
16:08
So if you want to do SEO, then it is very important to learn how to make a good report.
16:15
But don't worry, you will also get to learn reporting in this series. So you must have got the basic idea of what SEO does, not just rank.
16:25
Now, if we start comparing all these duties with ads, then you will see what the PPC executives do.
16:37
Neither do they pay attention to making the website indexable, nor do they pay attention to making it crawlable.
16:43
Page speed is also not one of their duties. I am not telling you their mistakes, I am telling you that their duty does not exist. The job of a PPC executive is to create an ad campaign on Google or Meta or Instagram or any other platform.
16:55
See your billing and then run that ad campaign properly. And for any ad campaign, a landing page is required on the website.
17:05
If it is on your website, then it is fine. If not, then they can make it on any of their websites. That will also work.
17:11
If an ad is running on Instagram, then the URL of your website is not necessary there. You can take it on WhatsApp, you can take it on a lead call, etc.
17:18
There are many different ways. So in this case, if you leave your website on the basis of PPC, then they will never manage your website.
17:27
Because it is not their duty. It is just like you call a plumber in your house to fix a pipe pipe. And hope that he will also fix your light before leaving.
17:35
This never happens. So SEOs take care of your website overall. In our experience, all the unmanaged websites have a very low conversion ratio of Google Ads or Meta Ads.
Indexing: How Google Saves Your Content
17:48
Only a well-managed website can do a good conversion from all the ad channels. So whenever any website or any business owner needs to take care of their website.
17:59
When they realize that our website is in a very bad condition, then they will hire a developer. They will hire an SEO for the website.
18:08
Now, if you have understood so many things. So now we come to those acronyms that have confused people a lot.
18:15
Let's take a look at all these acronyms one by one. See, words are not bad in themselves. It is important to understand the intention of the people who make those words.
18:23
Like SEO is a wrong word in itself. It should have been OSE, but SEO stuck. So we are using it.
18:29
So let's look at each word and see if you should use it or not. So the first buzzword is AIO.
18:36
AIO means Artificial Intelligence Optimization. Now, it is possible that this word is useful for scientists and engineers in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
18:46
But it is not useful for marketers. Because we marketers do not work on Artificial Intelligence.
18:52
Some of our search engines use some algorithms of Artificial Intelligence. There are some different platforms like ChatGPT.
19:00
There, a sub part of Artificial Intelligence, LLM, is used. But we do not work on the field of Artificial Intelligence.
Ranking: When Your Site Shows Up in Results
19:08
So to say in this field that we optimize for Artificial Intelligence is wrong. The user of any website will not be a scientist of Artificial Intelligence.
19:17
Who will go and ask in front of a big supercomputer, Tell me where I have to get root canal done. It does not happen.
19:23
Where will people ask? People will ask on search engines. People will ask on LLM bots, i.e. ChatGPT, etc. So we have to optimize for that.
19:30
We do not optimize for Artificial Intelligence. That's why AIO is a wrong word in itself. The second word is AEO, i.e. Answer Engine Optimization.
19:38
Now Answer Engine Optimization is a little sensible word in itself. Because ChatGPT gives answers in itself.
19:45
Google's AI mode also gives answers. It is not giving search results. It is giving answers. So when we optimize for such platforms,
19:53
It can be called Answer Engine Optimization. AEO is a sensible word.
20:00
Let's keep a pin on this point, we'll come back to it in a while. After this, the second word is AI SEO, meaning Artificial Intelligence Based Search Engine Optimization.
20:09
This acronym is fine by itself, but the problem is that it's not like AI has just started being used in search engines.
20:18
Google started using the first AI-based algorithm in search engines in 2017.
20:24
So any SEO that has been doing it since 2017, was already doing AI SEO.
20:30
We are all doing AI SEO in today's date, because we optimize for Rank Brain, Spam Brain, we optimize for different link penalties.
20:40
Google Analytics 4 version is completely AI based, so we are all doing AI SEO, there is nothing new.
20:46
The third word that is gaining more traction these days is GEO, meaning Generative Engine Optimization.
20:52
Optimizing for platforms that use Generative AI. This is also similar to AEO, because all the platforms based on Generative AI give the same answers.
21:04
So AEO and GEO are the same thing, there is no difference between the two. We'll come to AEO and GEO in a while.
21:12
After this, the next word is LLMO, meaning Large Language Model Optimization. This is also problematic by itself, because we don't optimize for large language models, we can't do it, because large language model is a big field in itself.
21:25
Like AI has become a big umbrella term, it has a lot of LLMs, Large Language Models.
The Eight Duties of an SEO
21:31
Large Language Models don't just do one thing, they are also generating images, videos, they are also doing predictions, they are also being used in the medical field, they are not just doing the job of giving answers to people.
21:43
So if we say large language model optimization, then it is a very big term, which is far beyond search or search professional, marketing professional.
21:52
It is a big thing, basically it is different, it becomes a completely different field. So LLMO is not a useful term in itself.
21:58
There are only two terms that are left to be used, which are GEO or AEO, whichever you pick.
22:04
So in all these new acronyms, GEO is the most on trend nowadays, GEO is being pushed more, the people who were still seen in conferences in the name of SEO, they are pushing more on GEO.
22:15
We will have to understand SEO first, that what new activities do we do in GEO, which we are not already doing in SEO.
22:23
Something should be new, if you are bringing a new acronym. By the way, before I start talking about SEO, AEO, GEO, let me tell you which side I am on.
22:31
I am a traditional SEO, so I feel that all the activities we were doing in SEO so far, they are all enough.
22:37
There is nothing new in GEO that you need to do. So far, there has been no such thing, which was not normally covered in SEO.
22:47
I will explain one by one, and I will not just give my side here. To find out new points of GEO, I will reference this article of Search Engine Land, which is a big publication in the SEO industry.
22:59
And here I have taken out a list, that according to Search Engine Land, what is new in GEO, and after this we will see whether it comes in SEO, is covered or not.
23:08
So here the list of GEO parts, Search Engine Land, first comes response generation, that is,
23:14
SEOs used to focus only on the content of the website, and in GEO, there is a sort of summary of the content of the website, which is created by chatbots, we optimize for that, and this is sort of false, because if you see and go, and if you see a lot
23:32
of news articles, then you will see a summary there, and this summary has always been used by news SEOs, to make a gist of the article of any website.
23:44
Too long didn't read, if someone doesn't have time to read the whole article, then we make a summary. I have told this kind of tricks in classes, in the last 1-2 years old batches, that whenever you generate your content, then a small gist of your content, of 3-4 lines, you can give it as a summary in the top part of your article, which will be different
24:03
from the meta description, we make the meta description a little catchy, you can make this summary a normal summary of a normal website page, and the new thing that is being said in this GEO, is exactly the same summary generation, nothing new, traditional
24:17
SEOs have been doing this response generation for a long time. The second differentiator factor is, content contextualization, my Hindi medium is not able to read it properly, but basically, the search engine itself is telling, that it means, that we optimize our content in the context of the user's query,
24:38
I don't know what kind of SEOs the search engine knows, but we traditional SEOs have always been doing this, according to the query of the user, the answer is always prepared, if the user comes to a dentist's website, to get information related to the
24:50
root canal, then we don't tell him about the hardware anyway, we don't tell him to go and eat sugarcane, the kind of problem, the kind of query, the same kind of content is done, it has always been optimized, there is nothing new, that will be done in
25:03
the GEO, and in SEO, you will not present the content in the real context, this is wrong. Point number 3, information synthesis, that is, the search engine believes, that in the GEO, that is, all the chatbots, they don't collect the information from a single source, they don't collect the information from a single page, but from different
Comparing SEO with Other Digital Marketing Roles
25:20
sources, they collect a lot of information, make a summary of it, and try to provide it to the user, so, you should make a lot of pages related to any information on your website, but then, silo structure has always been doing this, whenever we make a
25:34
silo structure, we catch a core topic there, and after that, we give in-depth information, we have told the students about this in our courses, that you will catch a core topic, and the queries related to that core topic, which are people also ask, or
25:47
the websites like also ask, from there, we remove those related questions, and make a page on it, we have been doing this for a long time, it is not new, the website named also ask, people also ask section, we have been using it for a long time, nothing
26:00
new, point number 4, user intent understanding, meaning, understanding the intent of the user who is coming on the website, and this is the most absurd point, on this YouTube, of any channel, not just my channel, of any channel, see the video on keyword
26:14
research, they will always tell you, that all the keywords, have 3 or 4 types of intent, commercial intent, navigational intent, transactional intent, informational intent, if you don't understand the understanding of this intent, then what else is there,
26:27
we always, in SEO, by understanding the intent of the user, on its base, either we create a funnel, or create content, or make a video, whatever the style of the landing page, it is all on the base of the user's intent, this is not new, we have been doing
26:40
this for a long time, number 5, algorithmic adaptation, meaning, search engine land says, that SEOs normally do not adapt to the algorithm,
26:51
Google's updates are very slow, but then, AI related updates, are very fast, that's why, the SEOs, the GEOs, need to adapt faster, but this search engine land, always complains, that Google's updates come very frequently, whenever the update comes, before it comes, the indicator of SEO rush,
Unpacking the Industry Acronyms (SEO, AIO, AEO, GEO, LLMO)
27:08
they start citing it, there is a chatter here, and Google has always said, that even if Google, launches a broad core update, 2 to 3 times in a year, but the small, industry wide updates, are continuously running, in fact, according to last year's estimate,
27:24
Google releases an update, every 2.5 hours, so, if in 2.5 hours, an update is being released, and SEOs are already, optimizing their content, their strategy, then, how fast will the update be, meaning, will the update be streamed, every minute, a new
27:38
update is coming, point number 6, content formatting, this is again absurd, because, we SEOs, don't just create content, we put blog posts, we put articles, we put news articles, we make testimonials, we make success stories, we make case studies, we
27:53
make white papers, what are we not making? What format of content, will be made, more than this?
27:59
Will, GEOs, give codes in JSON format, and understanding that, bots are going to do something? Nothing, again, this is again, same thing, which SEOs are doing, number 7, research driven strategy, almost, every industry, uses research driven strategy,
28:14
I mean, whenever you, make a strategy, strategy means, that you, again, think, with steps, you are going to do, and when we, don't do research, if we don't have, previous information, then how are we, making a strategy?
28:29
If, without any research, we are making a strategy, then it is nonsense, so research driven strategy, seems like, just a made up word, which, SEOs, GEOs, take it from anyone, if you, want to get your hair cut, then the person, who cuts your hair, will
28:42
think of something, based on his past experience, he will ask you, how to get your hair cut, nothing new, nothing specific, to GEO only, point number 8, is performance tracking, means, according to search engine land,
28:55
GEOs, track more performance, and change their strategy, based on it, but, what kind of, performance tracking, you are talking about?
29:03
SEOs, use every version, of Google analytics, and track their performance, and make a strategy, based on it, in fact,
29:10
SEOs, which are working, for more than 2 decades, every month, when we send invoice, 3 months, 6 months, we have to prove it, always have to prove it, in fact, this performance tracking, point, is not valid, for GEOs, because, neither, chat GPT, provides
Search Engine Land’s List: Is GEO Really New?
29:25
any data, on your website, or on their platform, how many times, someone clicked your keyword, how many times, it has surfaced, neither, perplexity, is providing such data, neither, in fact,
29:39
Gemini, which is Google's Gemini model, neither, AI mode, or AI overview, is providing any data, separately, so, which performance tracking, are you doing, apart from these 8 points,
29:50
I have not found, any other difference, on any other platform, so, I don't know, which new information,
29:56
I should use, to compare between, GEO and SEO, I don't have any problem, that, any, GEO, or, any, GEO, or, GEO, or, GEO, or, GEO, or, GEO, or, a particular process is called a GEO or SEO, it doesn't make any difference.
30:03
The only problem is that when people are trying to join this industry in the name of GEO, who don't know SEO yet.
30:10
If I want to teach these 8 points to a new student, that look, everyone is teaching SEO, I will teach these 8 new things, it is possible that the student will get misled, because he doesn't know what happens in SEO.
30:22
Are all these things in SEO or not? So, it means that the people who are packing themselves in the name of GEO experts, they don't know SEO properly.
30:29
And when such people take up a project, the project won't do well, the client will always blame them that the digital marketing has gone bad again. So, whether you want to learn this process in the name of GEO or SEO, you can learn the organic part of
30:41
digital marketing. So, after this first lecture, all your doubts about SEO, GEO, AEO, etc.
30:47
will be cleared, I hope. If anyone has any doubt, any question, then you can ask in the comment section or note it down with you and ask in the doubt session, which is going to happen on Sunday after 2-3 days.
31:00
To join the doubt session, again, as I said, you will have to join the membership. Normally, it won't be open publicly, because we just want to keep it for the students only, but again, Rs.
31:09
29 only, you can do this for your future. In the next class, we will talk about how Google search engines work, what are their ranking signals, and for which ranking signals you should focus, and for which ranking signals you don't have to pay attention.
31:23
In this course, we will talk about a lot of things, like what is the difference between a normal website SEO and news SEO, what are the special things that news SEOs do, or those who are doing SEO for the medical field, or those who are doing SEO for
31:34
B2B, or those who are doing SAAS SEO, what are all these things, what special activities do you have to do, and if you are going to apply in these companies, then on which skills you should focus more.
31:44
All these detailed, in-depth, professional talks will continue in this course, in different lectures. So, if you haven't subscribed yet, do subscribe.
31:50
See you in the next lecture. Till then, keep learning, keep practicing, keep making notes, and meet me in the live session. Thank you so much for watching this video.
GEO vs SEO: Amit’s Analysis
31:58
My name is Amit Tiwari from AmitTiwari.net and I will see you next time. Take care.


---

Hello everyone, this is the second class of the advanced SEO course. Today's topic is how search engines work and specifically how Google works.
0:07
In today's class, we will understand the basic structure of how search engines work. We will know what special features Google has.
0:16
And along with that, we will also understand the 10 methods by which Google discovers your URLs.
0:21
Old SEOs are only using sitemaps, but there are 10 methods by which Google discovers your URLs.
0:28
In today's video, the information was only in my private courses and in Google's own research papers.
0:34
I have not seen anyone explaining this information in any Hindi-English video yet.
0:39
If you know any such channel, please tell us in the comment section. We are bringing you very unique material.
0:44
I know a lot of people are saying that I should finish this course as soon as possible in a month. And instead of telling you how to rank a website, I am telling you how to work as a Google search engine.
0:55
But there is a reason for this. Today, a lot of SEOs are scared. Everyone thinks that people will work with ChatGPT and Perplexity.
1:02
Neither Google nor SEO will be saved. But the truth is that you are not understanding search engines, nor are you understanding LLMs like ChatGPT.
1:09
That's why you think that an LLM bot like ChatGPT, which works in a completely different way, can replace a search engine like Google, which works in the exact opposite way.
1:19
This confidence will only come when you understand the way both work. Once you understand which systems Google uses and how ChatGPT works, your fear will also go away.
1:31
There is a child. You throw him in the air and he laughs loudly. If someone throws you in the air, you will scream.
1:37
The difference between the two is that the child does not have fear. He laughs and enjoys. If you get rid of the fear of the destruction of search engines, Google updates, and SEO, then you will enjoy learning and you will get the benefit of this course.
1:51
What I am telling in the course, I have learned in 14 years. And I don't know how to explain 14 years of learning in a month.
1:59
I am not that capable. You will have to make notes by looking at each class. You will have to practice this course.
2:05
Then you will get some benefit. Someone will take a job from this course. Someone will get a promotion. Someone will increase their business.
2:11
And someone will just keep looking for tutorials. In which category are you? It will depend on your hard work and dedication.
2:17
So now, let's start today's class. You make notes. And whatever questions you have, ask them in tomorrow's doubt-solving class.
2:26
Doubt-solving class will be live. Now, the doubt-solving session will be live. But it will be members only.
2:32
And the way to join the membership, those who do not know yet, from Chrome or Safari, any browser, visit youtube.com slash Amit Tiwari. And there, on the side of the subscribe button, you will see the join button.
2:44
In fact, if you look below this video, on the side of the subscribe button, you will see the join button.
2:51
Click on it. It's a very easy process. It's only Rs. 29 per month. Those countries that do not have this join feature, this membership feature, we are making some arrangements for them as well.
How Search Engines Work - Basic Structure
3:01
Whenever such arrangements are made, I will inform you in the next class. How to join, where to join, etc.
3:07
You will get all the details. So now, let's go to the computer screen. And let's see how search engines and Google actually work.
3:13
So, here you can see a diagram on the screen.
3:25
And this is how an ideal, simple search engine works. This is its diagram. And don't worry, it may look a little complicated.
3:33
But I will start explaining it one by one. So let me zoom in. And a search engine starts from the internet.
3:41
It may sound very ironical. But this is my entire internet. There are a lot of websites on this internet. And our crawler picks up data from these websites.
3:49
The job of this crawler is to visit all the websites on the internet and accept the data from there.
3:55
Now, what is a crawler? I will explain it to those who are new to this industry. A crawler is not a special creature.
4:01
In fact, there are small programs that work for any search engine, for any company.
4:07
And they visit websites for them. Now, it is not necessary that this crawler is only available with Google.
4:13
There are many other small companies. For example, there is SEMrush and Ahrefs. You can also make your own crawlers for your own purposes.
4:20
You will get free open source programs on the internet. So, these crawlers work to visit different websites for Google or any search engine.
4:31
These crawlers have different names that the companies that make them give to them. For example, Google's crawlers are called Google Bot.
4:39
Bing's crawlers are called Bing Bot. And this is how this tradition is going on. Now, the crawler picks up any data from the website and gives it to another system called Indexer.
4:51
Indexers also have different names. For example, Google's indexer is called Caffeine. So, what does this indexer do?
4:58
It digests the data that it gets from the crawler.
5:04
And after doing some calculations, it gives it to another system called Index.
5:11
This indexer saves the data that it gets from the crawler.
5:18
This is a kind of storage where all the data is saved. Now, the data is saved. So, the crawler consumes the data of all the websites that we have on the internet.
5:29
The crawler goes to the indexer so that the indexer can understand, process and process the data that is saved by the crawler.
5:38
And after processing, the findings are saved in the index. Now, as soon as a user, a normal user, comes to this search engine, this is the interface.
5:48
What does the interface mean? For example, if we come to google.com, we can see a web page here.
5:54
This is our user interface. We will give a query here. Like, what is life?
6:00
And the answer will be here. So, overall, this is just a user interface. So, in the same way, our user comes to our interface.
6:08
Someone queries on their interface. Now, this query will not go directly to the index.
6:14
Otherwise, the system will not be scalable properly. So, the query of the interface goes to a mediator called query engine.
6:22
Its job is to take the query of the user to the index. And whatever information is obtained from the index, bring it to yourself and then provide it to the user.
6:32
So, here you are looking at the arrow in both directions. The direction here is single. That is, data from the web goes to the crawler.
6:38
No data from the crawler goes to the internet. Similarly, information from the crawler goes to the indexer.
6:44
No information from the indexer goes back to the crawler. Information from the indexer goes to the index.
6:50
No information from the index goes to the indexer or crawler. Now, the relation between index, query engine and interface is in both directions.
Core Systems of Google Search Engine
6:58
That is, information from the interface goes to the query engine. From the query engine to the index. From the index to the query engine. And from the query engine to the interface.
7:05
So, let's say that we are on the first day of the internet. Where there are only three websites in the world so far. The data of these three websites goes to the crawler.
7:12
The crawler consumes this data and sends it to the indexer. It goes to the indexer. After digestion, the data of these three websites in the index reaches the user through the query engine. While being an interface.
7:25
This is a very simple method. It is a very simple interface. And you can see here too.
7:31
You can see this very simple version too. It is not that whatever we posted on the internet, the user gets it directly.
7:38
Right? This direction is going through multiple layers. It is not that the data is going directly to the user from the internet.
7:46
So, whenever you think that my website is not getting indexed. I have published it. It is not getting published because this is not such a simple relation.
7:53
This relation is very complicated. It is going through so many steps. And this is also a very simplistic view of a modern search engine.
8:03
We come to the basic setup of Google. This is the architecture of the early days of Google search engine.
8:10
This is a bird eye view of it. In which you can see all the core systems of Google one by one. You can see the difference between these two.
8:18
There are only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 nodes here. In which we separate the internet and the user. There is a complete search engine symmetry in 5 nodes.
8:25
And if you come here. You can see a lot of nodes of different colors. There are 11 or 12 nodes here.
8:32
Here they are visible in different colors. And their entire staging. How do they get the information from where? Where do they parse?
8:39
Let's talk about all this now. So, first of all, we come here. Let me explain this color scheme to you. When it processes information in Google search engine.
The Four Main Parts of Google’s Architecture
8:47
We can divide it into 4 different parts. No. 1 is acquisition. No. 2 is indexing.
8:53
No. 4 is retrieval. And then ranking. That is, there are some nodes that do the work of acquisition.
8:59
They do the work of acquiring information. There are some nodes that do the work of indexing. The ones we are showing in blue.
9:05
And there are some nodes that do the work of retrieving. When the information was indexed. They do the work of retrieving it back.
9:12
And then there are some nodes that do the work of ranking any content. So, it looks a little complex in itself.
9:19
And it looks very confusing. We don't know where it starts from. And where it ends. Now, take a pause for a second.
9:26
Pause the video. And try to guess for yourself. After all, in this whole architecture of Google.
9:32
Where is the starting of this whole process coming from? Is it starting from here? From the search engine?
9:38
Or is it starting from the internet? Or is it starting from the beach here? Where is it starting from? And when I start doing this explanation.
9:44
Then you will see how correct or wrong your guess was. In fact, tell me in the comment section.
9:50
While pausing this video. According to you, from which node should it start? Now, your waiting time is over.
9:56
We come to the explanation. All these nodes. These are all the systems that do a particular job in Google.
Detailed Walkthrough of Google’s Data Flow
10:05
And these systems are kept separate so that Google can upgrade these systems separately, scale up these systems, increase their efficiency so that the internet that is continuously growing can handle the load.
10:19
So the story begins with the URL server. And the URL server is a system whose job is to maintain a very long list of URLs in which there are millions of URLs.
10:28
And it picks up these URLs in batches and feeds them to the crawler. If all the URLs are sent to the crawler at the same time, it will never be able to crawl them.
10:37
That's why this URL server only maintains the list of URLs. Now, whenever the URL server provides any URL to the crawler, it first checks in its list that I have got this URL many times.
10:50
The internet is very big. Any website's link can be accessed by Google's URL server from many different sources.
10:58
You may have linked example.com. Some other website has linked it. You can get a link from 50 websites. So it shouldn't happen that Google's crawler crawls these URLs again and again.
11:07
That's why the URL server removes the duplicates and only keeps the original URLs with it. And these are picked up in batches and given to the crawler on the basis of scheduling and urgency.
11:16
So, for example, whenever you request to index your URL on Google Search Console, that URL also comes to the URL server.
11:25
And the URL server sees that it is coming from Google Search Console, which means it is urgent. So I give it to the crawler quickly.
11:31
Now, you have to remember this whole lecture. Because when we discuss the discovery or indexing part in Google Search Console, then I will refer to this class again and again.
11:40
The URL list comes from the URL server to the crawler. And the crawler is nothing but a program that is coded in C++ language.
11:48
And their job is to go to the internet, visit all the URLs they find, and download the HTML from that page.
11:57
It downloads and saves all the HTML or assets on the page. This is the only job of the crawler.
12:03
The job of the crawler is not to read the content of your page, not to understand, not to index, not to rank.
12:09
It does nothing. Its job is only to go to the internet and request the URL there.
How Googlebot Works – In Depth
12:14
And after requesting, it saves all the files, images, videos, etc.
12:21
Now, the crawler uses a headless version of Chrome. And they try to render the page in the same way, the way a person can render on a normal browser.
12:34
Sometimes it happens that the crawler is not able to render your page properly, so it will not be able to save it.
12:41
And if it is not able to save, then it will not be used in any further process. Now, after the crawler, we come to the store server.
12:47
What is the job of the store server? The store server, as the name suggests, it works to store the data.
12:53
That is, the crawler compresses the HTML and content of the page. Literally, I make its zip file type.
13:01
When I say zip file, it does not mean that the file is made in zip format. It compresses on the basis of its internal structure. And after that, an internal ID is assigned to it.
13:10
So, let's say example.com slash page1. The crawler visited a page and downloaded all its HTML, images, etc.
13:18
After downloading, it gives it to the store server. And the store server compresses all that data into one file.
13:24
And gives that file an ID. Correct? And this compressed file is sent to the repository. The repository saves the compressed file of all the data.
13:40
The repository acts as a huge storage in the whole system. It is a huge storage in which petabytes of data are stored.
13:48
Whichever page Googlebot is visiting, it comes to the repository through the store server. It is saved in the repository.
13:55
Not millions of pages, but billions of pages are stored here. Its original version is saved here. Consider it as a huge disk drive.
14:03
It is a backup drive where a snapshot of the whole internet is saved.
14:10
Now, the content from the repository goes to the indexer. Now, you can see that the indexer system is very complicated.
14:19
The indexer system is giving data on many different nodes. The data is going from the indexer to the anchors, lexicon.
14:25
And the data is going from the indexer to the doc index. But before going into all that, let's understand the work of the indexer.
14:34
So, the indexer has two tasks. Number one is hit generation. And number two is link extraction.
14:40
The data has come to the indexer from the repository. What has the repository sent? The html that the crawler downloaded, he downloaded that html, signed an id here, and got the data from the repository.
14:53
And the data from the repository reached to the indexer. So, the indexer, first of all, uncompresses the data from the repository, unpacks it.
15:01
After unpacking, it breaks down the content text in small words.
How Content is Broken Down and Indexed
15:10
So, for example, if there is a line written on the page, Ram goes to school, so Ram becomes another word. goes to becomes another word, school becomes another word.
15:19
So, here goes to, there are two words to say, but he combined them together.
15:25
Now, this different breakdown, there is a purpose of this breakdown. This is not a deliberate breakdown.
15:31
Whenever a breakdown is made in words like this, an id is assigned to it. And this id is called word id.
15:37
We have to keep this word in mind. The content of the page, is divided into different words in the group of words.
15:45
And every word or group of words is given an id which is called word id.
15:51
This is HIT. What will be inside HIT? This will be the word.
15:57
That word will have an id. What is the position of that word on this page? What is the size of its font?
16:03
Is it in capital, small or camel case? All the properties of that particular word can be there.
16:09
Everything is inside this HIT. For example, we come to this web page. And we see here that the word is written as LIFE.
16:17
Now, the indexer of Google has made the HIT of this word LIFE. This word itself will be LIFE.
16:23
Its word id will also be included. What is its font size? What is its color?
16:29
Is it in L caps? Is it in I, F, E or small? And what is its position?
16:35
All this information is saved inside this HIT. Indexer's second job is link extraction. The one who has got the entire HTML from the repository, he has to not only break down the words, but also check if there is any link.
16:47
If there is a link, then he extracts the link and its anchor text.
16:53
And after extracting, what does he do? Here comes the second system.
16:59
Where is the data going from the indexer? To the anchors. What does the anchor system do?
17:05
It picks up the link and then saves the anchor of that link.
17:11
What is the name of this system? Anchor. So it only saves the anchor. After this, because the link came, what will happen in the link?
17:21
There will be anchor text and URL. After the anchor system, this information goes to the URL resolver.
17:27
And the URL resolver system has two important tasks. Number one, converting the relative URL to the absolute URL.
17:35
In many websites, the WordPress system makes the URL incomplete.
17:41
To make it user-friendly, it gives you an incomplete URL. How do you see the incomplete URL?
17:47
Whenever you go to the HTML code, you can see slash image slash first image dot jpeg.
17:53
Or the URL will be slash category slash subcategory slash page one.
17:59
Incomplete URL is made because the website system knows where to send the URL.
18:05
It will be sent as example.com slash image slash first dash image dot jpeg.
18:13
The user will be automatically sent to the system.
18:19
This programming is already in the website platform. But Googlebot is not a website platform. Whenever Googlebot is consuming a content or page, and wants to go back to that URL, it needs an absolute URL.
Links, PageRank, and URL Resolver
18:31
This URL can be visited. Example.com slash category slash sub dash category slash page one. It needs to go to this URL.
18:43
But where did Google get this information that I need to go to https://example.com slash page one. The URL resolver does this.
18:53
This is the relative URL. And this is the absolute URL. We need to remember the difference in the time of optimization.
19:01
In fact, let me give a hint to those who are already doing SEO. If you want to see SEO point of view, you should never use this kind of relative URL.
19:11
WordPress automatically suggests but you should not use it. You should give a complete URL.
19:17
Because if you are using this kind of URL on your website, Google system will have to use one step less for your website.
19:25
And if you save its resources, let's come to the second task of this URL resolver.
19:31
The second task of the URL resolver is very good. It is to get this URL to the right place.
19:37
It means that the content that has come to the indexer has come from the repository.
19:43
Now, when this document has been given an ID in the repository, that ID is also linked with this URL. Correct? Because where did this ID come from?
19:53
It came from this repository content. Right? Let's say you come out of a particular ex-household.
20:00
So, the person standing outside will think that you live in this house. Even if you are a guest, he won't know because you just came out of that door.
20:08
So, this URL resolver removes the document ID from this repository from this URL.
20:15
And assigns it to its domain. So, now if a page comes here, let's say we have a page example.com
20:25
There is a link on it, abc.com So, the document ID of example.com, let's say 123
Document Index & Real-Time Lookup
20:33
This document ID will not be used with the URL of abc.com It will be assigned to its own document ID.
20:41
And it can be anything. Now this system called URL resolver does not know this. The system called URL resolver only allows it to process further.
20:49
The system that comes later will do all the work on its own. But here its only job is to strip my document ID from the URL resolver repository.
20:57
For another URL. This does not happen with Anchor. Anchor text is the part of the same page.
21:03
So, it keeps using its original document ID. Okay? Correct? It must be looking a little confusing.
21:09
No problem, no need to be afraid. Everything will be understood now. Now, the path so far was very simplistic. We were moving forward step by step.
21:16
Three different branches are formed from the URL resolver. Right? So, this URL resolver is sending its data to three different systems.
21:24
It is sending to links, document index, and balance. It is important to understand all three separately.
21:31
First, the URL that is obtained from the URL resolver goes to a system called links. Now, this system called link is very amazing.
21:39
This is not a link storage. The job of this system called links is to make a map of all the links on the internet.
21:48
Which page is giving link to which page? Which page is getting link from which page?
21:54
Which website has different links from different websites? The job of making all these maps is done by this system called links.
22:03
This is very very important. Now, those who know SEO a little can guess which system can come after links.
22:12
If you are not able to guess now, it means your basics are bad. This system called links goes directly to page rank.
22:19
Because page rank is the algorithm which finds and tells the value of links.
22:25
So, we got the content on indexer from this whole repository.
22:31
The link obtained from indexer came to our URL resolver. The link obtained from URL resolver makes the map of links.
22:40
And this map of links drives page rank. Now, if page rank... I am going off track a little bit.
22:47
But if I see the node coming before page rank, then this is the searcher. This is the user who is giving query to Google.
22:55
So, where is the information coming from this searcher? It is not only coming from page rank. This information is also coming from document index.
Barrels, Lexicon, and Index Sorting
23:02
This information is also coming from barrel. This information is also coming from lexicon. So, when I or John Mueller or anyone says that don't focus on links, link won't give rank, we say this because the final information coming from searcher is not coming from only one system.
23:18
It is coming from four different systems. And this is also a little bit old architecture. It is simplistic architecture.
23:24
Now, in current system, there are many sources. So, let's come back to our topic. We came to link system.
23:31
So, what does link do? It makes a map of all the links coming from indexer to this system.
23:37
Which page is giving how many links. And then it feeds that data to page rank algorithm. So that page rank algorithm can tell the normal final system that what is the weight of all the links coming from websites.
23:51
It calculates the weight. It is a small task. Now, let's come back to our URL resolver. Because URL resolver is driving the whole story ahead.
23:59
URL resolver gives its information to doc index.
24:07
Doc index means document index. Now, what does document index do? It makes a short version of a page.
24:14
It makes a version which can be looked up very quickly. Means, it can be found.
24:21
Means, the information that document index has is how long is the content of a page.
24:28
What embeddings are there in it. This is just small information. So that it can be looked up very quickly.
24:34
When you search on Google, it shows the results in milliseconds. How many milliseconds I have taken out the information.
24:40
So, it will be in milliseconds only when the back end will work very fast. So, here page rank has already done a calculation.
24:47
In old times. And this document index has to give real-time information. But it should also work fast.
24:54
That's why it has a very quick lookup diary type. Now, this document index also goes in two directions.
25:01
Document index sends information to the searcher. Means, it sends information to the final system which is making the search results page.
25:08
And the second direction is upwards. Where is it going? To the URL server. Means, that URL server which is making the list of URLs which will be sent to the crawler.
25:18
Where does it get new URLs from? From the document index. Means, when you give an internal link to your own page on your website.
25:26
So, how does it work? There is a page. Your main page. Home page. Which was crawled by Googlebot. Went to the store server.
25:32
Its cached version. Saved it in the repository. Whenever it will go to the indexer from the repository. So, the indexer will extract the anchor and URL from there.
25:41
The extracted URLs. Extracted your own internal links. They will go to the document index.
25:47
Means, which will be useful to show your particular home page to any user in the search results.
25:53
And along with that, the same URL will go to the queue of your URL server. So that, the page can be crawled again from your internal link.
26:03
This is the importance of internal link. External links also work in the same way. But I am telling you in the context of internal link.
26:09
So, the information received from the URL resolver. First of all, it goes to the link. Along with the link, it goes to the document index.
26:15
The information from the document index. It goes back to the searcher. And to the URL server. A copy of this URL also goes.
26:22
That, I have got a new URL. Index this too. So, the list of the URL server is getting longer.
26:28
Now, this URL resolver does the third work. And that third work is to give information to the barrels. From the URL resolver, the URL goes to the barrel.
26:37
Now, when we are coming to the barrel. So, we have to see that the barrel is not only getting the information from the URL resolver.
26:44
The barrel is also getting the information from the index. See, I am doing this. This is also small. It was hidden. So, the barrel is getting the content from the indexer.
26:52
And the URL is getting the URL from the URL resolver. Now, what are these barrels? No. Let's understand the barrel too.
26:58
Now, before understanding the barrel. You can see a small system on the side. It is called lexicon. I have not explained this yet.
What Happens When a User Searches?
27:04
Let's see the lexicon too. The different works of the indexer system. One of the most important work is.
27:10
The whole page that it has got. The text in that page. To break down that text into different words.
27:16
After breaking it down. A unique ID is assigned to it. And that unique ID. Plus that word. Plus its position in that whole document.
27:24
Its font size. Its color. And so on. It is called HIT. The work of making HIT is done by the lexicon system.
27:33
This is one of the two works of the lexicon. The lexicon works from both sides. So, now we come to the second work.
27:39
What is that? So, the lexicon has made HIT. HIT is near the indexer. From the indexer, HIT goes inside the barrels.
27:45
Now, what are these barrels? I am saying barrels. B-A-R-R-E-L-S This is a plural word.
27:51
That is, there is one barrel. Now, what is a barrel? A barrel is the word ID of a particular word.
27:59
And the page in which that word was. It has a pair of document ID. That is, in a way.
28:05
The barrel system works to make an index. Which is any particular document.
28:11
The ID of that document. And all the text pieces in that document. All the words. The word ID of those words.
28:18
It works to mix it. So, one is the document ID. And all the words in that document. The ID of all those words.
28:25
If we mix these two, we get barrels. This is called a forward index. Correct? There is a document.
28:32
We broke it down into words. Document ID. Word ID in it. This became a forward index. Now, after this comes the second system.
28:39
Its name is a sorter. What does this sorter do? There is only one thing. But it is very important. It reverses that forward index.
28:46
That is, the index that was made now. On the basis of document ID. Now it becomes on the basis of word ID.
Ranking Signals and SEO Myths
28:52
So, all the different word IDs. Which document IDs are they matching with? Google gets this information.
28:59
So, the sorter. It makes our inverted index. The inverted index that Google uses. To rank.
29:06
Now, this information from the barrel. The information of the inverted index. Goes to the searcher. So, now you have. The four systems that are coming to the searcher.
29:13
Giving input. There is information about all of them. You know what page rank is. You know what document index is.
29:19
You found out what the barrel is. Information is coming from the sorter from the barrel. Information comes from the sorter from the barrel. The barrel made the forward index.
29:26
The sorter made the inverted index. Returned the barrels. The barrels fed that information to the searcher. After this, the lexicon. The lexicon is also connected to the searcher.
29:33
Now, what is the searcher? I had also told the searcher to simplify. Whatever the user is searching. But actually, the searcher is the system.
29:39
The search is connected to the user. So, here I should add one more thing.
29:45
Note. This is our search user. Final user. Right.
29:51
And this final user is only connecting. With this searcher system. So, now what does this searcher system do? It connects in both ways.
29:58
Let's do it in both ways. Our user sends a query to Google's front-end search system and front-end system sends the query to lexicon because lexicon's job is to generate word id from text so searcher sends the same query to lexicon and lexicon asks Google to break down the query
30:23
and check if the word id is matching with any other word id that's how Google generates that fast answers so when Google executive says that we don't get 15% queries every year then where is that 85% matched query data coming from?
30:47
Google gets to know from lexicon that the query based on searcher's query is in your system or not if it's not then it means it's not a search query now all other systems will be used they will use the information from barrel, document index page rank
Google’s Discovery System: 10 Ways Google Finds Your URLs
31:06
will also be used later all the search results will come to Google system and they will be ranked based on page rank keep one thing in mind
31:18
Google doesn't rank the pages and then publish it it has only 10 links initially Google has only 10 links which has to be given for your search results query but which link will come on which position it is decided when it is visible on your device on
31:33
your mobile or desktop that means ranking is the last real-time process whether your website will be one of those 10 links or not depends on all these systems and which position it will be depends on page rank page rank and all the ranking signals associated
31:49
with it we will discuss all these ranking signals one by one and do not believe that there are 200 ranking signals 200 ranking signals was an imaginary number which was thrown actually there are not more than 200 ranking signals but you have to read only
32:05
1920 and you will understand it very easily your work has 5-6 ranking signals which you will remember well so this was a broad level simplified version of Google's search engine if you find it tough then get used to studying because you have to read this
32:20
much but if you read this much and understand this much then you will not be afraid of the upcoming updates if you understand this much then no one will be able to fool you and people who write sensational articles will not be able to scare you but today's
32:36
class is not over yet because now we have to talk about one more thing and that is Google's discovery system in yesterday's class I talked about that we can divide Google's work into 5 different steps discovery, crawling, rendering, indexing and ranking
32:52
now I will explain all these 4 parts one by one in the coming classes but because today we are already talking about very technical things so understand the discovery part today itself so that you don't face any problem so this discovery depends on many
33:07
different systems what is discovery? it means that Google has to know where your URL is a student has asked in the comment that how does Google know? if you have not made a backlink or given an internal link then how does Google know? there is also an
33:23
interesting fact that Google indexes the homepage of any website even if you don't make a link, don't do SEO, don't submit a sitemap don't even go to Google Search Console still Google goes to any website's homepage and indexes it first how does it happen?
33:39
we will find out now so let's come here and break down this system a little so this is our Googlebot to which all the URLs are going but this information is found through many different systems the first information that Google gets is from a system which
33:55
we SEOs call sitemap this is our sitemap what is sitemap? nothing it is a list of pages there will be a file on your website in .xml format in which all your URLs will be there example.com, page 1, page 2, page 3, page 4 anything all the URLs now we will
34:10
talk about this sitemap in a different specific class but in any format it can be in .xml, it can be in .txt however Google should only get a list of all your URLs it doesn't matter to me how you give just give the second way for Googlebot to find out
34:26
any URL this is called internal link there is a page example.com there was a page there was a homepage there is a link on it example.com page 9 and that is an internal link it goes to Googlebot
34:44
Googlebot will crawl it and after crawling it will visit it it will see and decide not to index now where is this discovery happening? if we go back to the structure of Google search then how do we know the crawler crawled the page went to the store server
34:57
went to the repository went to the indexer indexer to anchor anchor to url server url server to document index and from document index to url server and again crawler you have to do such a long journey when you think
35:09
I made an internal link why isn't Google indexing it? there must be a crowd on the url server right? it is possible that a lot of people went to the search console and made a crowd to index my url index, index, index so there is a crowd so it takes time
35:25
in scheduling be patient it will be done let's come back to the discovery module so internal link and external link both are the same so sitemap is the first medium to discover any url second is internal link third is external link fourth is random guessing
35:41
let's say you have given a list of urls in sitemap abc.com slash page 121 123 122 125 now you missed one 124 now Googlebot has so much sense that if in any website there is 121 page number 122 125 then there will be 23 and 24
35:59
you can do this experiment on your website make 4-5 pages make 10 pages from 1 to 10 and make page of 9 it will try to visit 9
Importance of Internal Links & Scheduling
36:09
Googlebot always does this so url guessing also works apart from this these are 4 main methods after this there are 6 other small systems not just 10 there can be more internal of google we moroccan people only know that there is url in server log which
36:46
you didn't visit anywhere no internal link no external link but if googlebot visited your error logs your server logs it is open then it will extract url from there let's say there is one page on your website which you didn't visit so googlebot will extract
37:23
url from there so if you want to keep any page secret then let's remove it from site map and put no index 6th method is to visit url and index it similarly google will index any new website you registered new domain after registering you installed wordpress
38:01
on it and connected it but when you connected it google will index it because you installed it in chrome 7th method is domain register google purchases new registered url from domain register and uses it to index url 8th method is rss feed if url comes
38:38
in rss feed then google can use it to index url 7th method is url submission in gse this is very useful because in google search console whenever you request url it goes to url server so automatically google bot visits url and gets discovered last method
Conclusion & Preview of Next Class
39:15
is js rendering thanks a lot google has more options than these used methods google always uses js there are more options than these used methods google always uses js there are more options than these used methods In the next class, we will talk about
39:52
how LLMs work, how large language models work, and a little spoiler alert, it's not LLM, it's LNM.
40:15
In the next class, someone will comment and tell us what LNM is. So see you in the next class, where we will see how LLMs work, what vectors are, what vector embedding is, and how you can start preparing your content for LLMs.
40:29
I won't teach you how to rank in the third class, you are still new to it. Whatever questions you have related to today's class, note them down and keep the questions as well.
40:39
In the next live class, which is going to be on Sunday, you will ask your questions in that. And to join the live class, the live doubt solving class, you will have to join the channel through a very nominal fee.
40:50
So join the channel and tell us that you are a solid student. And then see you in the live doubt session.
40:57
The doubt session is not just to discuss the problems of the course.
41:03
The live session will help you to keep a little bit of connection with this industry. I have faced hundreds of problems related to all the topics of the class that I am discussing.
41:15
And what are these problems, what are the solutions to these problems, how to solve them, how to work in the real world, you will get all this information in the live session, where a lot of things are going to happen, apart from the problems of the class.
41:26
So, I hope that I see maximum amount of you in live session. Thank you so much for watching this class.
41:33
My name is Amitabh for amitabh.net and I will see you next time.

1:51
Solve your doubts and retain this class well. Let's go to the computer screen and start today's class properly.
2:08
Everyone must know the full form of LLMs. LLM means Large Language Model. This name is a little confusing.
2:15
The implication is that computers somehow understand language.
2:22
Which is not right. Computers do not understand language. Computers only understand numbers. They still understand numbers.
2:28
If we want to give them the right name, then it should be Large Numbers Model. But every field has its own shortcoming.
2:35
It somehow keeps itself separate from the outside world through some words. So, computer scientists named it as Large Language Model.
2:43
Maybe they were motivated by this. They wanted to translate human language into the world of computers.
2:49
Maybe they had this aspiration. But technically, computers still do not understand languages. For them, this is a Large Numbers Model.
2:57
They only understand numbers. Before I start the explanation of LLMs, I need to give a clarification.
3:04
This is not a computer science class. This is a class for SEOs. All the concepts we will study are high-level overviews.
3:12
You will get a rough idea of how they work. And you will get all the information for your work.
3:19
But again, this is not a computer science class. Now, you may be wondering how computers connect language and numbers.
3:27
The method is very simple. Imagine that you have a very long Excel sheet.
3:34
In that Excel sheet, you do not need to explain LLMs in ABCD. There is a dictionary in English language.
3:42
In English language, there are around 10,000 words in total. So, it is a very big Excel sheet in which all the words are written one by one.
3:49
Apple, ball, cat, dog, elephant. All such words are written.
3:55
And a corresponding number is written in front of that word. That is, if there is an apple somewhere, it is 1. If there is a ball, it is 2.
4:02
If there is a cat, it is 3. If there is a dog, it is 4. Similarly, when I write a word, let's say, apple, ball, cat, the computer understands it as 1, 2, 3.
4:13
So, whenever you write 3, 2, 1 here, it means that for the computer, it will be cat, ball, apple.
4:20
So, this is a look-up table type for LLMs. Now, this process may seem very lengthy to you.
4:26
There are a lot of words like this. Assigning a number for each of those words and then looking at that number is a tedious task.
4:32
Well, for us humans, yes, it is tedious. But for computer systems, it is not that tedious.
4:38
So, all LLMs use a look-up table in a way. They use the number corresponding to any word.
4:44
Whenever you give a prompt, that prompt is always converted into numbers. And those numbers go inside the LLMs' system and complete all the calculations that were going on inside.
4:55
The output also comes in numbers. And then, finally, there is a system that again converts those numbers into words.
5:03
So, whenever you ask your favorite LLM chatbot, whether it is ChatGPT or Claude or someone else, to write a blog post on Best Dentist in Delhi, it actually understands it as a sequence of numbers.
5:17
And their internal systems, the entire blog post they write, is also a group of numbers, which is later converted into a human-readable language for you.
5:27
So, please remove this notion that whatever you are saying, LLMs understand it like a language.
5:34
They only understand numbers. We have understood this much. Now, let's come to the second step. Now, LLMs have three parts of training.
5:42
The first is pre-training. The second is SFT. The third is RLHF. The full form of SFT is Supervised Fine Tuning.
5:49
And RLHF means Reinforced Learning from Human Feedback. So, let's go through these three steps one by one.
5:55
As you know, large language models are basically prediction engines. That is, whatever prompt is given to them, if a line is given to them, they have to guess the next word from that line.
6:05
If I say, Ram goes to, now, what word is going to come before to, predicting this is the job of the LLM.
6:12
Now, how is this prediction done? For this prediction, large language models are given a lot of text, a lot of text, to train themselves.
6:22
Now, how is this training done? The concept of this training is very simple. It is a neural network. Just like our brain is made up of different connections of neurons, similarly, large language models are also made up of a lot of different connections.
6:35
You can think of these connections as a flip switch. Like a human neuron, one neuron does not do a lot of different things.
6:42
One neuron is sitting. Its job is to identify the yellow color from any scenery that is coming out of its eyes.
6:49
So, it will sit idle all the time. It will not do anything. As soon as it sees a yellow color coming out of your eyes, it will get triggered immediately.
6:58
See, I saw a yellow color. So, in the same way, all the neurons in the LLM models, which are different branches of the neural network, they are all for a specific task.
7:09
They are activated only for that task. Now, when we provide text to these models in a very large volume, provide content, it divides that content into different small pieces.
7:21
And it starts to find out the pattern. What is going to come after a particular word.
7:27
Now, it is not that when the training starts, all these switches know what to do.
7:33
They generate a loop in a way in which they guess the next word coming from any text.
7:39
And after that, the entire training data is seen whether the guess was accurate or not. If the guess was accurate, then that node is considered correct.
7:47
If it was not correct, then it is considered wrong. After that, another node is generated. So, this process is done by the computers themselves.
7:55
They do it simultaneously. And then, they develop a model which generates the next word after a particular word with a little accuracy.
8:10
So, overall, the final result model is based on the training data and whatever word it has seen before, on that basis, the next word does the work of guessing.
8:22
And this guess is based on a lot of data. That is why it is around accuracy. So, for example, if I say a line, then some of you will be able to guess the next word of that line.
8:33
And then Thakur killed Blank. Now, those who have seen the Sholay movie, they know that Thakur killed Gabbar.
8:42
But those who have not seen the Sholay movie, they do not know. If you know the back story of the story, then you can successfully guess the next word.
8:52
Technically, you have guessed it. But you only had the context. So, LLM models also generate accuracy in the same way.
9:00
Because they have all the data of the world written in the world, all the text, all the content, all the data from the images.
9:09
That is why they can generate the next content. That is why they can guess the next words.
9:16
This does not mean that they have understood everything. You have not watched the entire Sholay movie. But you know the story overall.
9:23
You know the context. That is why you can guess the next word. Now, this process is not unique in any way.
9:31
It seems very okay. It seems like this is a very good thing. It is a very simple thing. Why wasn't it done before?
9:37
Why were we waiting till now? Because the field of AI is not new. Let's come to a field which is n-gram.
9:43
What does n-gram mean? n means any particular number. So, it is 1 gram, 2 gram, 3 gram, 4 gram, n gram.
9:52
It is not a weighting gram. Let's see. So, let's imagine that we have a particular table where some special words are written.
10:00
name, boy, was, school, night, coming, food, blah, blah, blah, anything, right? Now, if I say, what can come after name?
10:07
What are the chances of the word name coming after name? You will say, it is very less. Name, name is not written in any sentence, right?
10:13
So, its chance will be very less, like 0.001. Now, when we talk about chance here, chance means probability, percentage, chances of anything happening.
10:24
The chances of anything happening are never 0, and never 100%, right?
10:29
Maybe name, name is not written, name, name is not written, but after name, name can be written by mistake, right?
10:36
So, it will not be 0% chance. So, whenever in this whole exercise, we will write probability or percentage in any way, it will never be 0 or 100, right?
10:44
So, chances of name, name are very less, but chances of name coming after boy are there, right?
10:52
Chances of name coming after was can also be some numbers, chances of name coming after school can also be some numbers, chances of name coming after night can also be some numbers, chances of name coming after coming can also be some numbers.
11:02
That means, if we start guessing in this way, that what will come after one particular word, then it is a very impossible thing, right?
11:11
It is very tough. So, what will happen if we give another word after one word? Like, let's come to the second example, 2 gram.
11:20
Now, I have one word, boy, and after that, the second word is name. So, chances of name coming after boy are less, right?
11:29
Chances of boy, boy coming are very less, it is 1%. Boy was, chances are 80%.
11:36
Boy school, chances of school coming after boy, can there be any sentence in which school will come after boy?
11:42
Very less chances, it can come, maybe. Boy night, very less chances. Boy coming, again, no sentence is made in which boy night is written or boy coming is written.
11:51
So, the percentage here only tells that after any particular word, what is the percentage of chances of another word coming?
11:58
So, if I am seeing, chances of was coming after boy, I have given this scoring, chances of was coming after boy are 80%.
12:04
Because a line can be made, boy was going to school, boy was coming from school, right?
12:10
So, if I am putting was after boy, then chances of it being correct are 80%. So, similarly, in this way, we have divided in probability.
12:18
Now, here also, using this framing is very tough in itself. We are not getting the chance of the coming word.
12:24
We are not getting the idea of the coming word. So, if we go to 3-gram, where we have two words, and the third comes in the list, what word can we use?
12:34
So, boy was, now I have two words. Here, I had only one word, boy, now I have two words, boy was.
12:41
So, boy was name, this sentence is not made, 10% chance. Chances of name coming, 10%.
12:47
Boy was boy, again, chances, 10%. Boy was was, this sentence is also not made, 1% chance.
12:54
But, if I see in this way, here comes an entry, chances of coming after boy was are more.
13:00
Boy was coming from school, this sentence can be made. So, its chances are 80% suddenly.
13:06
Boy was over, boy was over the top, boy was over some bridge, this kind of sentence can be made.
13:14
Its chances are more. Now, we come to 4-gram, where we have three words, boy was coming,
13:21
I have three words, now I have to guess the next word. Boy was coming name, this kind of sentence can't be made.
13:27
Boy was coming boy, this sentence can't be made, 1% chance. Boy was coming was, this is also less.
13:35
After this comes the word, boy was coming school, chances are, if someone has misspelled, if it is written in haste, then the school word can come, chances are 60%.
13:44
But, if I come in this sequence, boy was coming from, chances are 90%.
13:50
Because, boy was coming from school, LLM model, in its training time, boy was coming from, was coming from, this sentence must have been seen many times.
13:59
Right? So, in this way, its probability increases here. So, the model starts writing, boy was coming from.
14:07
So, here you can see, the number of times we keep giving each word, the number of times, this prediction, it becomes a little easy.
14:15
But, this calculation has to be done again and again. So, if I go to chatGPT for example, and I ask, write an essay on cow.
14:27
Here, I have given a prompt of only 4 words, 5 words, and for this, it has started predicting the word.
14:34
The cow is a domestic animal that has been an important part of human life for thousands of years.
14:40
That means, whenever you have to predict chatGPT for each word, its model is doing this calculation again and again out of its thousands of words.
14:49
Now, you imagine, we imagine that how many words can be there in the English language. The words in the English language, the common words, are around 50,000.
14:59
So, when this calculation has to be done for one word, then the probability that has to be checked has to be done 50,000 times.
15:05
Because, this excel sheet, like this, so, if we consider this as the probability machine of an English language directory, consider it as a sheet here, then it will be 50,000 rows and 50,000 columns.
15:16
Correct? So, 50,000 by 50,000. How much will this calculation be? 50,000 multiplied by 50,000.
15:26
So, here it will be 25. And then, how many zeros will be there after this? 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
15:33
That means, 2.5 billion calculations. To calculate one word, 2.5 billion calculations have to be done.
15:41
So, if chatGPT is writing a document of 100 words, then it will have to do 2.5 billion calculations 100 times.
15:47
Because of this, the field of AI, of LLM, was not moving forward. Because, from where is so much computing power written?
15:53
In this scene, the entry is of Transformers, which was made by Google. So, the Transformers model of Google, its title, the title of that research paper was,
16:02
Attention is all you need. That means, when this calculation is happening here, boy was coming from school.
16:11
Here, the calculation believes that name, or boy, or was, or school, or night, or coming, all these have the same meaning.
16:22
Right? That's why, it tries to calculate every word in the same way. It tries to calculate the same probability.
16:29
Now, the Transformers model of Google, says that, the text you have used till now, go and see that story, find out its meaning, and then, on the basis of meaning, start calculating this probability.
16:43
So, for example, if this line is, boy was coming, then what is boy? Boy is a male.
16:50
If it is a male, then what word will be used for it? He, not she. So, here, from this calculation, for she, the probability will be left to be calculated.
16:59
So, now, one calculation is less. Till now, the 50,000 by 50,000 that was happening, will become 50,000 by 49,999 because, one she was removed from here.
17:09
So, in the same way, if there is a complete dictionary of English language, then, for boy, the words that cannot be used, the female specific words, all of them will be removed.
17:19
If in that dictionary, any word is related to flying, or is related to animal, that will also be removed. Because, boy was coming, if any word is related to this, then there will be no flying, there will be no animal.
17:30
In this way, many irrelevant words are removed. And, by paying attention, to all the words that we have generated till now, keeping them in mind, we can save the calculation of all the remaining words.
17:43
If it is still not clear, I will give a very simple example. I will write a line and I will not say this line. I will just write.
17:52
I have just written this much. What will be my next word? What can be the next word? No idea?
17:58
Okay. Before this, I will write a word.
18:07
Now, you can answer this. My computer has 16 GB RAM. So, RAM is
18:14
costly. You can write. Or, RAM is important. You can write. But, if my first line here would have been
18:22
I worship RAM. So, here you would have written the next line.
18:28
RAM is divine. What is the change? The previous line. Right? The line to give attention, the context you got that.
18:36
And, you can guess the next line. So, the computer systems were lagging till now. LLM models were lagging.
18:42
Because, they had to do a lot of calculations. Because, they were trying to check every word equally in the dictionary.
18:48
Now, what do they do? They see the first word we got. In this word, what is the context?
18:54
They understand the story. And then, they try to guess the next word based on that. That is why, the name of the research paper was Attention is all you need.
19:03
And, this one trick reduced the resources required by the computer systems.
19:09
It is still a lot. But, it reduced in comparison with the previous one. The billions of calculations that had to be done, came to millions.
19:16
And, suddenly, the field of LLM increased a lot. So, till now, you understood how LLMs guess the word.
19:25
And, they just guess. They don't understand. And, what has Google's Transformers model changed in this?
19:32
It is very important to show you and explain to you. So, let me open ChatGPT again.
19:38
And, I will write my prompt here. Write an essay on cow.
19:45
Okay. I am going to press the enter button here. And, now, we will edit and slow down this process so that you can understand it well.
19:56
So, when I press this enter button, this prompt will go where it starts writing word by word.
20:02
This is a common misconception that as soon as you give a prompt, the chat GPT gets the full answer and it starts providing it directly.
20:12
This is not the case. What happens instead is that the answer that starts coming uses the same part of the answer in prompting again.
20:21
It might seem a little confusing. So, you have seen how Google's Transformers model works.
20:27
Now, let's come to the point that if LLMs only guess words, how do they sound so intelligent?
20:33
Here's a real-world example. When a child starts speaking, it says random words.
20:39
Ba, ba, ba, ba, da, da, da, da. What is it doing? It is listening to the words people around it are saying.
20:47
After listening, it just tries to say them again. It doesn't understand the words at that stage.
20:55
For example, a child born in the US listens to everyone around him in English.
21:01
A child born in India listens to everyone around him in Hindi or Kannada or Telugu.
21:07
It doesn't understand the words it is hearing. It doesn't understand the grammar.
21:13
But, it just listens to the words and tries to repeat them again. Now, the people around it start explaining them.
21:21
Like, you don't have to say da, da, da. You have to say papa. People around it start explaining them.
21:29
So, this reinforcement starts explaining to the child that,
21:35
I don't understand the meaning of the words, but I have to say them. If the child wants to drink water, it starts saying, give me water.
21:43
Before the child understands the meaning of the word, it understands its use. LLMs work in the same way.
21:49
They have a system called back propagation. The child guesses the word and the system understands whether it is correct or not.
21:59
If it is correct, then it is correct. If it is not correct, back propagation is a process that instructs the system to correct it.
22:09
So, pre-training is a method to set these dials that tells the LLMs that it will be correct to predict this word.
22:19
The next step is SFT or supervised fine-tuning. In this phase, when the LLM model is trained, it knows what to guess after one word, but it doesn't know how to answer the question.
22:35
It only knows how to guess the words. So, if you question the LLM chatbots, they don't answer, they only guess.
22:41
The process of answering is through SFT where these LLM models are given a layer, a large set of documents where the answer to the question is written.
22:51
In this document, it is written, write an essay on cow.
22:57
The question and answer are given in a set. Now, the LLM model understands that when someone asks me a specific question,
23:07
I have to answer in this way. Now, it understands the question and also the answer.
23:13
It understands the pattern of the question and answer. Now, it starts answering the question.
23:19
This is supervised fine-tuning. The third part is reinforced learning from human feedback.
23:27
What does this mean? The chatbot understands the question and the answer.
23:33
But, if someone asks how to make a bomb, the chatbot knows how to make a bomb.
23:39
It has all the data in the training material. But, it doesn't have to answer the question. This understanding is through the RLHF process where the chatbots have the safety settings.
23:51
They are given an understanding of which questions can be harmful and they don't have to answer them.
23:57
Which images can be wrong and they don't have to make them. This last step of the training is called
24:05
RLHF. When these three processes are completed, we get an LLM model which can answer our questions, write content for us, etc.
24:17
in the safety settings. Let me clarify something here. I feel a little guilty.
24:23
Sometimes, I treat LLMs and ChatGPT on the same level. ChatGPT is not an LLM.
24:29
LLMs are GPT-5. The models are LLMs. So, GPT-5,
24:35
GPT-4.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Nano are all LLMs. They are large language models.
24:41
ChatGPT is a chatbot which is a wrapper of this LLM. Okay? If someone is asking if LLM is GPT-4 or GPT-5 LLM or if ChatGPT is LLM, the answer will be GPT-5 or GPT-4.
24:55
ChatGPT is not an LLM. ChatGPT is an application based on LLM.
25:01
So, we have understood how large language models work and what was the advantage of Google's Transformer system
25:09
Now, we have to understand vector and vector embeddings to understand perplexity.
25:15
So, let's come to vectors. You must have heard the saying that if there are two horses and ten elephants, what will be the result?
25:27
Our maths teacher used to taunt us that two horses and four elephants cannot be added or subtracted because both are separate units.
25:35
In English, there is a phrase Now, you can actually subtract, add, and multiply apples and oranges.
25:43
This is the power of vectors. Vectors can convert any physical object, person, place, item, or any concept into maths.
25:55
Not numbers. For example, we saw a sheet where apples are 1, balls are 2, cats are 3, dogs are 4.
26:05
Correct? But vectors are not random numbers. Vectors are a way to divide any object based on its properties.
26:15
It is a way to itemize so that you can convert any object into maths.
26:21
And if any object is converted into numbers, we can add, subtract, or multiply it.
26:29
What is the use of this? Let's say I ask you to divide money.
26:35
You will say, money and stubbornness. But how to do it in maths?
26:41
How to do it unsupervised? How to subtract SEO from a client? Right? Vectors are an interesting concept.
26:49
I will try to explain it with a simple example. Our old students have already seen this example.
26:57
Let's say we have a dentist. Now, I will divide this dentist into numbers based on its properties.
27:05
It is a probability score. As I said, nothing will be 0 and nothing will be 1.
27:11
Everything is between 0 and 1. So, if there is a dentist, there is a 50% chance that he will be male and 50% chance that he will be female.
27:21
So, 0.5 male, 0.5 female. Dental knowledge? Any dentist will have a lot of dental knowledge.
27:27
So, we give 0.9. Any doctor will have medical knowledge. So, 0.9.
27:33
But any dentist will have very little farming knowledge. So, 0.1.
27:39
Maybe there is a dentist who comes from a village. But he does not know anything practical.
27:45
So, 0.1. Will a dentist have knowledge about weapons?
27:51
No. Bravery? A dentist thinks that if a woman stands, she can be beaten.
27:59
So, it takes bravery. But 0.4. Okay? So, this is a dentist.
28:07
Now, let's say there is a farmer. A farmer. We start giving a score to a farmer based on these properties.
28:15
That is, male, female, dental knowledge, medical knowledge, farming knowledge, weapons knowledge, and bravery.
28:23
So, the chances of a farmer being a male are very high. There are 0.9 chances that he will be a male.
28:29
There are also female farmers. Women also do agriculture, but their numbers are very low.
28:35
So, there are 0.9 chances that he is a male farmer. 0.1 is that he is a female.
28:41
A farmer has 0.1 dental knowledge. Obviously, there is no need. There is no scope.
28:47
Medical knowledge will also be 0.1 because there is very little scope for a farmer to have medical knowledge.
28:53
Agriculture knowledge will be 0.9. Weapons knowledge will be very little. Again, there are 0.1 chances.
28:59
It looks like bravery because farmers are brave. It is bravery to give up your entire year's hard work with the help of the weather.
29:09
Now, after the farmer, we see the score of the soldier. If there is a soldier, the chances of him being a male are very high.
29:17
There are also female soldiers, but there are still more male soldiers. So, the score will be a little less in comparison to the farmer.
29:25
There are 0.8 chances that a soldier will be a male and 0.2 chances that he will be a female.
29:31
Dental knowledge will obviously be the minimum for a soldier. Medical knowledge will also be 0.1.
29:37
Farming knowledge, many of our soldiers come from the background of the village.
29:43
So, 0.4 is the knowledge of agriculture. But the knowledge of weapons will be very high because they are soldiers.
29:51
So, 0.9 will be the knowledge of weapons. And bravery, obviously, if someone is a soldier, he or she is brave enough to do everything. So, the score of bravery will be 0.9.
30:02
Now, if I write all these properties one after the other, then this becomes their vector score, right?
30:12
That is, a dentist's vector score is 0.5, 0.5, 0.9, 0.1, 0.4.
30:19
A farmer's score is 0.9, 0.1, 0.1, 0.9, 0.1, 0.4.
30:25
A soldier's score is 0.8, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.4, 0.9, 0.9.
30:31
All three numbers are different. Now, let's put a twist here. Let's say that we have a doctor with a dentist.
30:38
Now, the chances of a doctor being male are 0.5. Many doctors are male, many are female.
30:46
There is a 50-50 chance. 0.5, 0.5, male, female. Dental knowledge will be less than that of a dentist, but it will be there.
30:53
Anatomical knowledge is 0.3. Medical knowledge is 0.9. Correct? Farming knowledge is 0.1.
31:01
It will be very minimum knowledge. As much as the dentist knows, so much will be known. Then the knowledge of weapons is also less.
31:07
Bravery is also there. They have as much as the dentist has. So, what is the vector score of a doctor? 0.5, 0.5, 0.3, 0.9, 0.1, 0.1, 0.4.
31:19
Now, if you see, the vector score of any dentist is very different from the vector score of any farmer or soldier.
31:27
Even if I remove it here, if I don't tell you which is the dentist, which is the doctor, which is the farmer, then you can understand just by looking at the score that these two things, they are anything, but they are close.
31:39
They can be anything, but they are close. So, vectorization, vectorization means that we divide anything on the basis of its properties.
31:50
We give its score on the basis of its properties. Now, here I am giving 4-5 numbers. This is a very simple example.
31:58
Whenever computer models make vectors, the number here is in hundreds, it can be in thousands, because computer systems can divide anything on the basis of many elements.
32:09
Its color, its size, its state, it can be many things. So, this is a vector.
32:16
Now, what are vector embeddings? When a computer system, when an LLM model divides anything on the basis of its training data, scores it on the basis of different elements, different properties, then that score is called an embedding.
32:37
It is not human-comprehensive. We don't understand it, but computer models understand it. The way I am sitting in this room, it is a three-dimensional room.
32:45
It has a length, a width, and a height. There are three different dimensions in which I am living.
32:52
You are also living in a three-dimensional world. Embeddings are in a multi-dimensional world, where any particular element, any dot is placed in the middle of many dimensions, and then computer models, even if they don't understand this concept, they don't know dentists, they don't know doctors, but
33:07
when they are in the middle of all these dimensions, this is how our vector score is made here, which is an ideal, an imaginary vector score, it is in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7 different dimensions.
33:19
So, in this seven-dimensional world, if the vector of the dentist is here, then the doctor is also close to it.
33:26
You can understand by looking at the number, it is very close. But the farmer and the soldier are completely different in the other world.
33:34
So, by calculating this distance, by observing this distance, the computer systems, the LLM models, they understand which two concepts are close and which two concepts are completely different.
33:47
Similarly, in the same way, if you have seen a movie on Netflix, it suggests you another movie.
33:54
When you watch a video on YouTube, the other video also recommends you on this basis. It is not looking at the title description now.
34:01
It creates an embedding on the basis of a video that has a very different concept, feature, length, how many people clicked its thumbnail, etc.
34:10
and that embedding is thrown into a multi-dimensional world.
34:16
And whenever you watch a video, the YouTube algorithm goes and checks which video's embedding is closest to this particular video's embedding.
34:25
And we recommend that video. The same process is also used in search results, where an embedding of the question you are asking is made and the vector embeddings of all the other pages are also made and the search results are provided by measuring its closeness.
34:41
And when we convert our user's query, or our keyword, or our pages into vectors, into embeddings and optimize them, then that is called semantic SEO.
34:51
We will practice this process in the coming classes and then you will become a semantic SEO.
34:57
This is the basic process of semantic SEO which we do in many steps. We develop tools for it, we use different scripts, but you have an idea of what is going to happen.
35:08
Now, as I said, this is a very high-level overview. It is not accurate. You have to understand the concept.
35:14
I am neither a computer scientist nor am I going to make you. So, the last topic of today's class is a rag system like perplexity.
35:21
Rag means Retrieval Augmented Generation. So, these rag systems are a little unique.
35:28
We just saw that LLM models need training. They consume a lot of data and train.
35:35
Rags are one step ahead of LLM where we can update a system, a chatbot, or an LLM system without training.
35:47
There is no need for training again. So, there is a basic model that has been trained. We provide a little bit of new information to it and it can use the new information and provide an answer based on the old understanding.
36:00
It can update itself. So, Retrieval Augmented Generation, RAG.
36:06
Perplexity is also a type of RAG, but this is a different type of RAG. There are two types of RAG.
36:13
One is where data is provided in a static way. So, let's say there was an LLM like chatGPT.
36:19
We gave it a little more document that has been updated in the last 8-10 months. The new literature that has been made, the new progress that has been made, the news that has come, we gave it all.
36:29
So, we provided it in a static way once. This is a static RAG. The second is a real-time RAG in which the computer system provides the answer in real-time by using web search.
36:41
So, when you ask a question with perplexity, then perplexity gives you the answer by searching from the website in real-time.
36:48
So, this will be a real-time RAG. Now, let's look at the diagram once to see how this RAG works.
36:54
Each RAG has two parts. The first part is at the top, and the second part is at the bottom, and they are connected to each other.
37:01
So, let's start understanding this in one way. The first part converts the training data into a vector database.
37:10
So, let's say a lot of documents were provided. There were a lot of documents that were given to this RAG system.
37:18
What did it do? It broke down the content of the document into small parts.
37:27
There was a whole page, and it was broken down into paragraphs. After this, the paragraphs, the chunks of text, are given to an embedding generation model.
37:36
That is, the model that takes out each word from any text and converts it into vector embeddings.
37:43
So, as I said a while ago, computer systems generate vector embeddings on their own, on the basis of their own training.
37:51
So, this is a model that generated embeddings from this text chunk and stored them in a vector database.
37:57
There was a vector database where all these embeddings were stored. Now, a user comes.
38:03
What does that user do? He asks a question. You went to Perplexity and asked a question. So, this question, first, the embeddings are taken out of this question.
38:13
The word of this question is converted into embeddings. Right? Now, the task of converting the embeddings can be done by another model.
38:22
Along with this, the other embedding generation model that used to be there, can also be done by this. Both can be done.
38:28
There is no problem in both. It depends on how the system was made. To make it easy, we made the embedding model separately.
38:35
This embedding model, the query, took out different embeddings from it.
38:41
And then, another system, which works as a query embedding, that is, the question is divided into different embeddings, but a proper question is made out of it.
38:50
Now, after this, this query goes to the vector database. That is, it wants to see what are the related clues related to the embeddings that I have in the question in the database.
39:03
Along with this, from here, from this query embedding, a live search function is also done.
39:10
That is, when you question with perplexity, that question is converted into a query embedding. And then, it is sent to two places.
39:18
One goes to its own vector database, which is its own vector database. And it decides there whether I have data related to this question or not.
39:28
Whatever data is there, it comes from the vector database to this LLM engine. Similarly, at the same time, a live search is also initiated from the query embedding.
39:37
Now, this is perplexity. Perplexity brings you real-time results. You think, this is a very good answer.
39:43
But here, the answer to a question has not yet been found. Perplexity. I tried to search a lot. If you find it, then tell me.
39:49
After all, where is this search? Because, where is the search done? It is done on some search engine. Perplexity does not have a search engine.
39:56
Right? So, I tried to find out whether Bing has it or not. Is there any such system that is loaning Perplexity, is Perplexity using Bing search engine, is it using Yandex, is it using Baidu, because it is not using Google, Google is a killer.
40:11
But Perplexity talks about sophisticated AI search in its document, but where are you searching that AI search, there should be an index to search.
40:22
If I search, give me the latest news about Delhi, then do you visit all the news websites related to Delhi at once?
40:28
This does not happen, or it is that Perplexity has a list of authoritative websites on a particular topic.
40:34
Whenever there is any search related to those topics, it only visits those websites. But it is not like that, because the answer is also taken from new websites.
40:43
So here it is a little gray area, but I leave this question, because I am not talking about Perplexity, I am talking about the RAG system, which is like Perplexity.
40:51
So whatever system will be like Perplexity, it will send the query to its vector database, which is made of its own data.
41:00
The data is changed to chunk, the chunk is converted to embedding, and the embedding is stored in the vector database, from where a level of search is done.
41:08
A second level of search is done, it is a live search, it can use a search engine, it can use a search provider API, like SERP API, or Data for SEO, or HANDS data.
41:19
From anywhere, it pulls a live search in some way, or it goes to the website, visits it, and gets the data from there.
41:26
And both of those outputs are sent to an LLM model.
41:32
Now there are three inputs on this LLM model, not two. The first one is the vector database. Let me zoom out a little, so that you can understand better.
41:40
So this LLM model has three things. One is coming from the vector database, which has storage in the database, content.
41:48
What were the related chunks sent by the query embedding?
41:54
The second is the data coming from the live search. And the third query also came to the LLM. You will see that in Perplexity, there are many options to select different models.
42:04
You can use JGPT 5, you can use Cloud, you can use Gemini. Where is it used? It is used here.
42:11
This is the stage where you change the model. So their database is not changing. Their database is the same.
42:17
Whatever information comes, it will be the same. It will be equal, whether you use JGPT or Gemini, whatever you use.
42:24
The data coming from the live search will also be the same. But understanding the query and matching the data coming from the understood query, and generating the right text answer, that is the job of this LLM node.
42:38
So this LLM node looks at the coming question, looks at the information, combines both, and then gives an answer, which is given to the user.
42:49
So if we want to optimize for a system like Perplexity, what do we have to do? The search feature is also here.
42:55
This search is also here. Now this search is happening from which system, Perplexity is not telling. But we can guess how many search engines are present in the world, which are crawling all the internet.
43:06
Either it is Google, or it is Bing, or it is something like Baidu or Yandex. Yandex does not crawl so many websites.
43:13
But whatever is possible, they are using the SEMrush bot. It is possible that they are using the HRFs. They must be using something.
43:19
But someone should use the search engine. They are using something for the search. It is also possible that Perplexity has developed its own internal search engine, which they are using, but they are not using it for the general, normal public.
43:30
That is why they are not telling us. Whatever it is, but there has to be a system, search engine, or search API provider, which brings them real-time results.
43:39
If they are using a system like SERP API, then the query is given to the API, that this is my question.
43:46
In return, bring me the answer. Where do they bring it from? That is the job of the API. So, in the backend, Perplexity is also using a particular type of search engine.
43:55
It is using a particular type of search engine. The search engine is wrong. Now, I hope that they are using a Google system.
44:01
Because if they use Bing, then the quality of Bing search results is still bad. No matter how much you hate Google, but if you compare it with Bing search results, then the difference is still there.
44:11
Here, a differentiating factor happens. When you do a query, the query is not understood by normal keywords.
44:18
There is a model, which extracts embeddings, understands your query in a better way, and gives you answers from the database and live search.
44:26
And then, there is another LLM model, which gives you answers on the database.
44:32
So, in RAG or Perplexity, you like the quality of the answer, because there is a system, which understands your question very well.
44:39
You don't know what to ask, but it knows how to increase or improve the user question. Then, the data that is extracted, it doesn't just give you a link, but it combines all your answers, and without any effort, it extracts the answer.
44:56
That's why you like it. In the time of Google, you had to visit all the 10 pages, then you had to understand, and the quality of the answer depends on your understanding.
45:05
That's why, some people will like a system like Perplexity, who don't have a good habit of reading search or documents, and extracting answers from them.
45:12
Some people won't like it, because they already have the experience of working in search. So, when we understand the use cases of users for Perplexity, we have to see how aware our audience is.
45:26
There will be some special industries, whose users will like the answers of Perplexity, and some users won't like it.
45:32
There is a makeup site, maybe the consumers will like the answers of Perplexity, and the visitors and readers of neuroscientists won't like it.
45:40
So, this is a personalized answer, whose quality is perceived. But, after today's class,
45:46
I hope you won't have any confusion about LLMs, Vector, Vector Embedding, Google's Transfer Models, and RAG, which is based on systems like Perplexity.
45:55
I know this is too much. I know I have tried to simplify things a lot. Maybe some people may find some concepts tough.
46:02
Maybe some people may find it very watered down, but this is the midway, in which everyone has to catch up once.
46:08
If you have more information than this, it's a good thing. The upcoming classes will be easier for you. If you find it difficult, please watch it 2-3 times.
46:16
It's not a big deal. Consider it as a re-watch of the episode. The channel's watch time will increase. Correct? But whatever it is, try to understand these concepts, so that you can better understand the upcoming classes.
46:28
And this was a high-level overview of LLM, RAG, and Google's Transformers model, which is very important for SEOs, Digital Marketers.
46:36
Now, if you have already taken a membership, the class is not yet over for you. You should go to the post section, where an exercise is waiting for you.
46:45
Complete that assignment. And then you can consider today's class complete. And if you haven't taken a membership yet, then what are you waiting for?
46:54
It's just a question of Rs. 29. You have to take a membership. And in the next live doubt class, which will be on Sunday, you have to meet me, ask your questions, clear your doubts, and move your career forward.
47:06
Now, this was the third class of this course. I hope you found this class very useful. I hope you enjoyed it. Whatever you felt, tell me in the comment section.
47:13
In the next class, which is the fourth class, we will dive into the Google Search Console. The basic students, who are just starting out in SEO, will get to learn how to use the Google Search Console.
47:25
You will get to know what the Google Search Console is, what its superpowers are, how you can connect your website with it, etc.
47:31
And those who are already experienced SEOs, who have been using the Google Search Console for a long time, I promise, you will definitely get at least 10 things, which you haven't seen in the Google Search Console yet.
47:42
You will get to learn different ways of using the Google Search Console. I work with different types of industries' websites.
47:49
There are news websites, e-com websites, business sites, and all these types of different websites have their own challenges, which they face in the Google Search Console.
47:58
And how they solve those practical challenges, we will see all of that in the Google Search Console. The Google Search Console is the primary tool of any SEO.
48:06
You don't have to use SEMrush, you don't have to use Ahrefs, you don't have to use any API, you don't have to go to the end-to-end, but if you know the Google Search Console well, no one can leave you behind.
48:15
So, we will start the practical class of the Google Search Console, in which we will get to know this tool, this useful, basic, first principle tool, in the same way as you know the back part of your right hand.
48:26
So, let's meet in the fourth class, where we will learn the Google Search Console from A to Z. Until then, keep attending the classes, keep making notes, and keep asking questions in the live classes.
48:35
Thank you so much for attending this class. My name is Amit.

बैकलिंक्स एसइओ इंडस्ट्री का सबसे
0:01
कंट्रोवर्शियल टॉपिक इस पर सबके पास
0:03
अपने-अपने बिलीफ हैं। कुछ लोग खरीदना
0:06
चाहते हैं, कुछ लोग बनाना चाहते हैं। कुछ
0:08
लोगों को बैकलिंक्स जरूरी लगती है और कुछ
0:10
लोगों को ये पुराना आउटडेटेड कांसेप्ट
0:12
लगता है। बट इन सबके बीच में असली कहानी
0:14
क्या है? और क्या फ्यूचर में बैकलिंक्स
0:16
बनाने की जरूरत नहीं पड़ेगी? क्या हम उस
0:18
फ्यूचर में ऑलरेडी खड़े हैं? आज की वीडियो
0:21
में हम जानते हैं। हेलो एवरीवन, आई एम
0:22
अमित तिवारी फ्रॉम अमित.net और आज के इस
0:24
वीडियो में हम बैकलिंक्स का फ्यूचर देखने
0:25
की कोशिश कर रहे हैं।
0:27
[संगीत]
0:35
थोड़ा पीछे चलते हैं इस कहानी को समझने के
0:37
लिए। 9293 में जाते हैं जहां पर उस दौर के
0:40
सर्च इंजंस बहुत बेसिक कांसेप्ट पर काम
0:42
करते थे। अगर कोई सर्च करता था बेस्ट
0:44
डेंटिस्ट इन दिल्ली तो वो उन पेजेस को
0:46
सर्च रिजल्ट्स में सबसे ऊपर दिखाते थे
0:48
जिनमें सबसे ज्यादा बार बेस्ट डेंटिस्ट इन
0:51
दिल्ली लिखा होता था। सिंपल सा कांसेप्ट
0:54
है। लेकिन इस मेथड की प्रॉब्लम यह थी कि
0:56
इसे बहुत आसानी से बुद्धू बनाया जा सकता
0:58
था। उस वक्त के एसइओस वेबसाइट पर ब्लैक
1:01
बैकग्राउंड के ऊपर ब्लैक कलर में कीवर्ड
1:03
डाल देते थे। या फिर वाइट बैकग्राउंड के
1:05
ऊपर वाइट कलर में टेक्स्ट को डाल दिया
1:07
जाता था। कई सारे लोग नॉर्मली कीवर्ड को
1:10
स्टफ करते थे पेज में कहीं पर भी और फिर
1:12
स्पैन के जरिए सीएसएस क्लास के जरिए उसका
1:14
फॉन्ट साइज जीरो कर देते थे। जैसे इंसानों
1:17
को ये ठूसे हुए कीवर्ड नहीं दिखाई देते
1:19
थे। लेकिन सर्च इंजंस उस टेक्स्ट के
1:21
कीवर्ड्स को यूज करके पेजेस को हायर रैंक
1:24
देते थे और लोगों को गलत रिजल्ट्स मिल रहे
1:26
थे। नाउ इस प्रॉब्लम का सॉल्यूशन सिंपल
1:29
था। सिंपल सॉल्यूशन है। पूरे पेजेस को
1:31
पढ़ो, पढ़कर समझो कि भाई कौन सा पेज रियली
1:34
में किसी भी एक क्वेरी के लिए सही इनेशन
1:36
दे रहा है और फिर उसी पेज को हायर रैंक
1:39
दो। लेकिन आखिर कंप्यूटर सिस्टम्स कितने
1:42
सारे पेजेस को पढ़ सकते थे। यह पहली
1:44
प्रॉब्लम थी और दूसरी प्रॉब्लम थी कि उन
1:46
पढ़े हुए कंटेंट को समझता सिस्टम कैसे? तब
1:49
तक टेक्नोलॉजी इतनी फास्ट नहीं थी।
1:50
कंप्यूटर सिस्टम भी इतने सारे फास्ट नहीं
1:53
थे। इसीलिए इस टेक्निकल प्रॉब्लम का एक
1:56
क्रिएटिव सॉल्यूशन चाहिए था। और इस
1:57
सॉल्यूशन को लेकर आए Google के फाउंडर।
2:00
Google ने पेजेस में कीवर्ड की जगह किसी
2:03
और ही चीज को यूज़ करके उसकी वैल्यू को
2:05
डिसाइड करना शुरू कर दिया। और ये जो नई
2:08
चीज थी ये थी बैकलिंक। इमेजिन करिए कि एक
2:10
वेब पेज है जिस पर चार अलग-अलग पेजेस के
2:13
लिंक्स हैं। एक यूजर इस वेब पेज पर आता है
2:16
और अगर उसे रैंडमली किसी भी एक लिंक पर
2:18
क्लिक करना हो तो मे बी वो फर्स्ट लिंक पर
2:20
क्लिक करेगा, मे बी सेकंड पर क्लिक करे,
2:22
मे बी थर्ड पर या फिर मे बी फोर्थ पर
2:24
क्लिक कर दे। इन सबके चांसेस बराबर-बराबर
2:26
हैं। रैंडमली अगर क्लिक करना है तो किसी
2:28
भी लिंक पर क्लिक किया जा सकता है। इसे
2:30
मार्क ऑफ चेन इफेक्ट कहा जाता है। Google
2:32
फाउंडर लेरी पेज ने अपनी पेज रैंक
2:35
एल्गोरििदम इसी कांसेप्ट को उल्टा करके
2:37
बना दी। यानी कि जिस पेज पर सबसे ज्यादा
2:40
लिंक्स मिलेगी लोगों के उस पर क्लिक करने
2:43
के चांसेस ज्यादा होंगे। सो जिस पेज पर
2:45
क्लिक करने के चांसेस ज्यादा होंगे वो
2:47
ज्यादा अच्छा होगा और Google को इस ज्यादा
2:50
अच्छे पेज को ही सर्च रिजल्स में सबसे ऊपर
2:52
दिखाना है। सो लिंक्स के इफेक्ट को
2:55
बैकवर्ड करके काउंट किया गया और यहीं से
2:57
बैकलिंक वर्ड या बैकलिंक का कांसेप्ट
3:00
सामने आ गया। सो किसी भी एक पेज की वैल्यू
3:03
इस बात पर डिपेंड करने लगी कि उसको कितने
3:05
सारे अलग-अलग पेजेस से लिंक मिल रहे थे।
3:08
जो एसइओस अभी तक कीवर्ड स्टफिंग कर रहे
3:11
थे। अब वो ज्यादा से ज्यादा बैकलिंक्स
3:13
बनाने लगे। और एक जमाना था जब किसी भी पेज
3:16
पर किसी भी तरीके से अगर आप लिंक बना रहे
3:18
हैं तो वो लिंक आपके वेब पेज को हायर रैंक
3:21
देता था। इंस्टेंट होता था। ये जो रैंडमली
3:24
क्लिक करने वाला कांसेप्ट है इसे Google
3:26
ने नाम दिया रैंडम सर्फर मॉडल। इस वर्ड को
3:30
बहुत अच्छे से याद रखिएगा। अभी इस पर हम
3:32
थोड़ी देर में वापस आएंगे। इसके बाद 2002
3:35
में Google के ताहिर हवेली वाला ने टॉपिक
3:37
सेंसिटिव पेज रैंक को प्रेजेंट किया और
3:39
ओरिजिनल पेज रैंक में चेंज किया गया।
3:41
Google ने इंडस्ट्री वाइज बैकलिंक्स के
3:43
इंपैक्ट को मेजर करना शुरू कर दिया। लेट्स
3:45
से दो डेंटिस्ट वेबसाइट हैं डेंटिस्ट ए और
3:47
डेंटिस्ट बी। डेंटिस्ट ए की वेबसाइट को 10
3:50
हार्डवेयर स्टोर वाली वेबसाइट से
3:51
बैकलिंक्स मिलती हैं। और डेंटिस्ट बी की
3:53
वेबसाइट को दो मेडिकल वेबसाइट से
3:55
बैकलिंक्स मिलती हैं। सो इस केस में
3:56
डेंटिस्ट बी की रैंक ज्यादा होगी।
3:58
डेंटिस्ट ए की नहीं होगी। जबकि डेंटिस्ट ए
4:01
के पास ज्यादा वेबसाइट से बैकलिंक मिल रही
4:04
है। ऐसा इसलिए हो रहा था बिकॉज़ अब Google
4:06
किसी भी एक पर्टिकुलर टॉपिक पर बनी हुई
4:08
वेबसाइट को उसी टॉपिक पर बनी हुई वेबसाइट
4:10
से मिलने वाली बैकलिंक्स को ज्यादा वैल्यू
4:12
दे रहा था ना कि रैंडमली किसी भी वेबसाइट
4:15
से मिलने वाली बैकलिंक से। नाउ यहां पर
4:17
याद रखना जरूरी है कि ये पूरा का पूरा
4:19
मैथमेटिकल फार्मूला पर बेस्ड है। सो जब
4:22
मैं कहता हूं कि इंडस्ट्री वाली वेबसाइट
4:24
से मिली हुई बैकलिंक्स को ज्यादा वैल्यू
4:25
दे रहा है इसका मतलब ये है कि जो
4:27
इंडस्ट्री से बाहर वाली वेबसाइट्स हैं
4:30
उनसे मिलने वाली जो बैकलिंक्स हैं उनको कम
4:32
वैल्यू मिल रही थी लेकिन वैल्यू जीरो नहीं
4:34
हुई थी। इसका एक इंपैक्ट भी पड़ा। जब भी
4:37
किसी भी एक पर्टिकुलर इंडस्ट्री में, किसी
4:38
भी एक पर्टिकुलर लोकेशन पर लेट से 10
4:40
वेबसाइट बनी हुई है और वो 10 की 10
4:42
वेबसाइट रैंडम वेबसाइट से ही बैकलिंक्स
4:45
अपने लिए जनरेट करा रही थी या परचेस कर
4:47
रही है या कुछ भी कर रही थी। सो ऐसे केसेस
4:49
में एक इल्लुजन बनता है कि रेंडमली आप
4:51
किसी वेबसाइट पर बैकलिंक बनाएंगे तो भी
4:53
वेबसाइट रैंक करेगी बिकॉज़ उस पूल में
4:55
मौजूद सारी वेबसाइट इंडस्ट्री वाइज़
4:57
बैकलिंक्स को बना ही नहीं रहे हैं। सो ये
4:59
एक मिसकंसेप्शन था जिसने एसइओस की एक पूरी
5:01
की पूरी जनरेशन को मिसगाइड किया और वो
5:03
रैंडमली किसी वेबसाइट पर बैकलिंक बनाते रह
5:05
गए। नाउ, अब वापस हम आते हैं रैंडम सर्फ़र
5:08
मॉडल के ऊपर। इसमें एक बड़ी फ़ौल्ट है। हम
5:10
एक नॉर्मल वेब पेज देखते हैं। इनफैक्ट एक
5:11
या चार पांच पेजेस को देख लेते हैं। यहां
5:13
पर आप देख सकते हैं कि इन पेजेस पर काफी
5:15
सारे लिंक्स हैं। ये एक हेडर में लिंक है,
5:17
फुटर में भी लिंक है। और ये जो पेज पर मेन
5:19
कंटेंट पड़ा हुआ है ना इस पर भी बहुत सारे
5:22
लिंक्स हैं। नाउ अगर आप खुद एक नॉर्मल
5:24
यूजर की तरह देखें सोचें तो आप जानते हैं
5:27
कि फुटर पर कितनी बार क्लिक किया जाता है।
5:30
फुटर के लिंक तक कोई पहुंचता भी है। हेडर
5:32
पर भी अगर कोई लिंक है उस पर क्लिक करना
5:34
है तो तभी क्लिक किया जाएगा जब नेविगेशन
5:36
के लिए रिक्वायरमेंट होगी। कोई कंटेंट को
5:38
पढ़ने के लिए हेडर पर जाकर क्लिक नहीं
5:40
करता है। इस पेज के कंटेंट के बेस पर
5:43
क्लिक करने के सबसे ज्यादा चांसेस तभी
5:44
होते हैं जब कॉनेंट के बीच में ही लिंक
5:47
हो। यही रीज़नेबल लॉजिक हुआ है ना? इस
5:50
रीज़नेबल लॉजिक को Google ने 2010 में अपने
5:53
रैंडम सर्फर मॉडल को रिप्लेस करने में यूज़
5:55
किया। और अब इस नए मॉडल का नाम हुआ
5:58
रीज़नेबल सर्फर मॉडल। इसमें किसी भी एक पेज
6:02
की सारी बैकलिंक्स को सेम वेट नहीं दिया
6:04
जाता था। बल्कि उन लिंक्स को ज्यादा वेट
6:06
दिया जाता था। ज्यादाेंस दी जाती थी जिन
6:08
पर यूजर के क्लिक करने के ज्यादा चांसेस
6:10
होते थे। अ सो अब फुटर की जो लिंक्स होती
6:13
हैं, साइड बार की लिंक्स होती हैं, उनकी
6:15
वैल्यू कम हो गई और पेज के मेन कंटेंट की
6:17
लिंक्स की वैल्यू ज्यादा हो गई। इनफैक्ट
6:19
जिन एसइओस ने इस पेटेंट को पढ़ा, समझा, इस
6:22
पूरी टेक्निक को समझा वो यह भी जान गए कि
6:24
मेन कंटेंट के अंदर भी जो लिंक्स ऊपर होती
6:27
हैं उनकी वैल्यू ज्यादा होती है ना कि जो
6:29
लिंक्स एकदम बॉटम टेक्स्ट में पड़ी हुई
6:31
हैं। यानी कि अब जिस लिंक के दिखाई देने
6:33
जिसके क्लिक होने के चांसेस ज्यादा हैं,
6:35
वैल्यू भी उसी बैकलिंक की ज्यादा हो गई।
6:37
सो फुटर और साइड बार की लिंक्स की वैल्यू
6:39
कम हो गई। ऑलदो लोग अभी भी कमेंट वाली
6:41
बैकलिंक्स फिर भी बनाए चलाए दे रहे थे।
6:44
जबकि Google उन्हें काफी कमेंस दे रहा था।
6:47
इसके अलावा Google ने बैकलिंक्स कीेंस को
6:49
कैलकुलेट करने के बहुत सारे छोटे-छोटे सब
6:51
सिस्टम्स ल्च किए जो लिंक्स की वैल्यू को
6:53
कैलकुलेट करते वक्त एंकर टेक्स्ट में क्या
6:56
है? किस तरह का टेक्स्ट पड़ा हुआ है?
6:58
गवर्नमेंट या फिर एजुकेशन डोमेन से तो
6:59
लिंक नहीं है। लिंक स्पैम जैसे सिस्टम इन
7:02
सभी फिल्टर्स को ऐड किया जो किसी भी
7:04
बैकलिन की वैल्यू को सिर्फ उसकी पोजीशन या
7:07
उसके होने या ना होने के बेस पर डिसाइड
7:08
नहीं कर रहे थे। बल्कि इन सारे फिल्टर्स
7:10
को कैलकुलेट करने के बाद लिंक्स को
7:12
एक्चुअली में वेटेज दिया जा रहा था। बहुत
7:15
सारे फैक्टर्स थे और इस वजह से हर लिंक की
7:17
जो वैल्यू है वो अलग-अलग हो गई। एक कॉमन
7:20
बैकलिंक की वैल्यू अब इस बात पर डिपेंड
7:22
नहीं करती थी कि वो है बल्कि इस बात पर
7:25
डिपेंड करती थी कि वो पेज में कहां है,
7:27
किस एंकर टेक्स्ट को यूज़ कर रहा है, किस
7:29
डोमेन से दिया जा रहा है। उस डोमेन ने
7:31
कहीं पेड बैकलिंक्स तो बहुत सारे लोगों को
7:33
नहीं बेच रखी है। एंड सो ऑन। बट लिंक्स
7:36
अभी भी काफी यूज़फुल थी क्योंकि वो कहीं ना
7:39
कहीं पेज कीेंस को बता रही थी। Google के
7:42
पास बैकलिंक ही एक अभी भी सबसे बड़ा
7:44
मीडियम था जिससे किसी भी पेज की वैल्यू
7:47
किसी खास यूजर के लिए क्या है उसे रियली
7:49
में समझा जा सके। सो अब हम आ जाते हैं
7:52
अपनी उस ओरिजिनल प्रॉब्लम की तरफ जिसे
7:54
हमने इस वीडियो की शुरुआत में इरेज़ किया
7:55
था कि किसी भी पर्टिकुलर पेज की रैंक इस
7:57
बात पर डिपेंड करनी चाहिए कि उसके अंदर जो
8:00
कंटेंट है वो यूजर की क्वेरी के लिए कितना
8:02
सही है, कितना एक्यूरेट है ना कि उसमें
8:05
मौजूद कीवर्ड और बैकलिंक्स की तादाद। सो
8:08
अब हम आते हैं एआई एरा में जहां पर ये काम
8:11
एक्चुअली में करना पॉसिबल हो पाया। अब
8:12
कंप्यूटरर्स की स्पीड बढ़ चुकी है और किसी
8:15
भी पेज के कंटेंट को समझने के लिए Google
8:18
को या किसी भी सर्च इंजंस को बहुत ज्यादा
8:20
पावर की बहुत ज्यादा कंप्यूटेशन की जरूरत
8:22
नहीं है। बिकॉज़ एलएलएम मॉडल्स किसी भी पेज
8:24
के कंटेंट को वेक्टर एंबेडिटिंग्स और
8:26
वेक्टर स्कोर के जरिए आराम से समझ भी सकते
8:28
हैं। यूजर की क्वेरी के साथ में मैच भी कर
8:30
सकते हैं। और ये सारी चीजें ऑन द फ्लाई हो
8:32
सकती हैं। Google के अपने इंडेक्स के अंदर
8:34
भी हो सकती हैं। सो बैकलिंक्स की अब जो
8:36
जरूरत है वो और भी कम हो गई। अब बैकलिंक्स
8:38
की जरूरत कहां पर आती है? है। बैकलिंक्स
8:40
की जरूरत आती है जब किसी भी पर्टिकुलर पेज
8:43
का जो कंटेंट है वो उतना ही अच्छा है
8:45
जितना नेक्स्ट पेज का कंटेंट है। सो जब भी
8:48
किसी भी पर्टिकुलर क्वेरी के लिए दो या दो
8:50
से ज्यादा ऐसे पेजेस होते हैं जिनका
8:52
कंटेंट सिमेंटिकली एकदम इक्वल है। अच्छा
8:55
है, सूटेबल है। यूजर के लिए मैच कर रहा
8:57
है। सो अब अगर Google को ये पता करना है
8:59
कि जो सिमेंटिकली इक्वल पेजेस हैं, इनमें
9:02
से कौन सा पेज ज्यादा रैंक पर दिखाया जाए
9:04
और किस पेज को रैंक कम दी जाए। ऐसी
9:06
सिचुएशन में यूज किया जाता है बैकलिंक्स
9:08
को और हाई क्वालिटी बैकलिंक्स को। सो जब
9:10
भी Googleर्स ये बोलते हैं कि उन्हें अब
9:12
किसी भी पेज को रैंक करने के लिए बहुत कम
9:14
बैकलिंक्स की जरूरत है। वो झूठ नहीं बोल
9:16
रहे हैं। वो सही कह रहे हैं। उन वो एकदम
9:18
वर्ड टू वर्ड सही कह रहे हैं। इट्स जस्ट
9:20
दैट कि हम समझ नहीं रहे हैं। कई सारे
9:21
एसइओस अभी भी ऐसा सोचते हैं कि बैकलिंक्स
9:24
जिस तरह से 1999 में या 2002 में काम करती
9:27
थी वैसे ही काम करती हैं। आप किसी भी
9:28
पर्टिकुलर रैंडम वेबसाइट पर जाएंगे वहां
9:30
पर बैकलिंक बनाएंगे। उसका इंपैक्ट उतना ही
9:32
होगा। यह गलत है और जो लोग यह सोच रहे हैं
9:34
कि अगर वह गेस्ट पोस्ट वाली हाई क्वालिटी
9:37
बैकलिंक्स बनाते रहेंगे तो भी उनका पेज
9:39
रैंक करेगा वो भी गलत है। अब आपके पेज की
9:43
रैंक इस बात पर डिपेंड करती है कि आपके
9:45
पेज का कंटेंट यूजर की क्वेरी से कितना
9:48
मैच करता है। जो पर्टिकुलर एक यूजर सर्च
9:51
कर रहा है उसकी क्वेरी से कितना मैच करता
9:53
है। और अगर आप ऐसी इंडस्ट्री में हैं जहां
9:55
पर आपके कंपैटिट बहुत अच्छी वेबसाइट से
9:58
बहुत हाई क्वालिटी अथॉरिटेटिव वेबसाइट से
10:00
बैकलिंक्स ले चुके हैं तो आपका कंटेंट
10:03
रैंक अच्छा नहीं करेगा। नो मैटर आप कितनी
10:05
लो क्वालिटी 1000 2000 बैकलिंक्स बनवा
10:07
लें। आपको उन हाई डोमेन हाई अथॉरिटी वाले
10:10
डोमेनस को बीट करना होगा बैकलिंक्स में।
10:12
अदरवाइज आपका कंटेंट नहीं रैंक कर पाएगा।
10:15
सो डोंट जस्ट फोकस ऑन बैकलिंक्स। फोकस ऑन
10:18
योर कंटेंट फर्स्ट। फोकस करें कि आपका
10:20
कंटेंट आपके यूजर की क्वेरी के लिए
10:22
सिमेंटिकली मैच करता हो। एंड देन इसके बाद
10:25
हाई क्वालिटी बैकलिंक्स की तरफ फोकस करें।
10:27
देन दे विल बी यूज़फुल। अगर आपका कंटेंट
10:30
आपके कंपैटर से हल्का है तो कोई भी
10:32
बैकलिंक आपकी हेल्प नहीं कर पाएगी और
10:33
बैकलिंक तभी हेल्प करेगी जब वो हाई
10:35
अथॉरिटी डोमेन से होगी। अदरवाइज नॉर्मल
10:37
बैकलिंक्स डेड होने वाली हैं। डेड हो चुकी
10:40
हैं। हम अपने पुराने वीडियो में डिस्कस कर
10:42
चुके हैं। सो मिलते हैं अगले वीडियो में
10:43
किसी और इंटरेस्टिंग टॉपिक, टिप या फिर
10:45
ट्रिक के साथ में। तब तक के लिए कीप
10:46
लर्निंग, कीप प्रैक्टिसिंग। थैंक यू सो मच
10:48

This is the tool that makes your website and Google friends with each other and you are the mediator in between.
0:05
You both have BFFs. You get to hear from Google and you also get to know about your website. You also get to know what are the problems of your website and you also get to know what are the expectations and complaints that Google has from your website.
0:18
So Google Search Console is very important. Whether you are starting your career now or you have been doing SEO for many years, you will always find some points in Google Search Console that you might not have thought of before. In today's class, we will start learning Google Search Console from
0:32
the basics. And slowly we will go to the advanced level. But if you are an old SEO veteran, then also watch the whole video so that you will definitely get some new things.
0:41
And in the upcoming classes, we will see the very advanced use of Google Search Console. Where we will see some dashboards of news websites, some e-commerce big websites.
0:51
Where you will get to know how issues are compiled and how you can solve them in Google Search Console on a big level where there are millions of pages.
1:00
So in this series, you will also start understanding Google Search Console from the basics. And you will also see the content of 50-20 million traffic websites at a very advanced level.
1:10
You will see their issues and learn to solve them. Now this is the fourth class of this course. If you have not attended the previous three classes and missed any of them, then go and watch those classes first.
1:20
And then attend this class. Only then you will get the full benefit of this course. We have structured the course in such a way that you watch the classes one after the other and get to learn everything.
1:29
Apart from this, note down all your doubts about this class or the previous class. So that you can ask your questions in the upcoming live doubt session on Sunday.
1:40
Everyone knows how to join the live session. Those who don't know, go to the main page of this channel, go to youtube.com slash amit tiwari.
1:48
You will see the join button on the side of the subscribe button. The cost is 29 rupees per month. Two samosas are coming.
1:54
Join and move your career forward. Let's go to the computer screen and start learning Google Search Console.
2:01
Google Search Console So we have come to the computer screen.
2:11
And those who have attended the previous class know that this is a basic diagram of Google Search.
2:18
So we have not landed on Google Search Console but on Google Search Engine. And this is not by mistake. Before understanding Google Search Console, you will have to see what is the use of Google Search Console.
2:28
A lot of things become clear from here. Trust me, a lot of senior SEOs also fail to fully utilize the use of Google Search Console.
2:36
The reason is that you don't know its use case. The work of Google Search Console is to smooth out the connection between you and your website.
2:46
It is not possible that Google visits your website and everything becomes smooth. The reason is that Google Search Engine is a very complex process in itself.
2:55
Somewhere, your URL is being extracted. Then it is being crawled in batches.
3:00
Then its content is being stored. Its lexicons are being made. Content is being explained.
3:06
Again, the URL is being extracted and sent to the URL server. A lot of pages are being ranked.
3:12
Some pages will look good in Google. Some pages will look good in Google. Some will not look good. Google can have problems with a lot of URLs in this complex system.
3:22
Whenever there is a problem, what should it do? Should it ignore your website? You don't want that. You want Google to tell you about the problems it is facing with your website.
3:33
And this is what Google Search Console does. Google Search Console comes in the middle of all this.
3:41
Its job is to come in between your website and Google and smooth out your communication.
3:49
This is the job of Google Search Console. Now, Google Search Console is a portal between your website and Google.
3:56
You have understood this. Now, let's try to understand the behavior of Google Search Console. I will make a different node here.
4:03
And it is very important for you to understand the basics of Google Search Console. Google Search Console is a low-memory system.
4:10
It is a low-performance system. It is a low-priority system. Now, what do I mean by low-performance or low-priority system?
4:16
Google Search Console is a tool available for every website for free. Google keeps dumping information related to your website.
4:23
It is your responsibility to dissect that information, understand it and resolve it on its basis.
4:29
But Google cannot give this tool called Google Search Console a high priority. Because it requires a lot of resources.
4:36
You should always remember this point while using Google Search Console. Because there are many scenarios where we fix a problem but Google Search Console does not update it.
4:45
And then we keep getting confused whether this problem is solved or not. And many times, we increase our complication to solve a solved problem.
4:53
That's why, always remember that Google Search Console is a low-priority, low-performance system. Where you will get to know the problems after some delay.
5:01
And you will get to know the solution after some time. To use Google Search Console, you can search directly.
5:08
Search Console. And whatever is the first result you see, click on it. And then click on Start Now button.
5:14
When you open Google Search Console for the first time, you will see a screen like this. Where you can see two choices.
5:20
This is not a blue pill or a red pill. These are actually both blue pills. Where you have to eat both. Okay.
5:26
Here you can see two things. Domain and URL prefix. And I will explain the difference between these two. But you have to use both.
5:32
Here, one more thing is important. All these Google services start with Google account, Gmail account.
5:39
So, you have to login to any website. So, you have to login to any email ID. So, you have to login to any website with Google account.
5:49
Like I have logged in here with an ID. So, now let's see what is the difference between domain and URL prefix.
5:55
And how do you utilize it. So, when you purchase a domain. Google.com. Mamytiwari.net.
6:01
XYZ.com. Whatever you purchase, you only purchase a domain. So, let's say example.com. This is our domain.
6:07
When you link example.com with Google Search Console.
6:13
So, it is called domain property. Okay. And when we add the URL of the website with Google Search Console.
6:20
So, it is called URL prefix property. Let's take a very simple example. Everything is URL prefix property.
6:26
And everyone has their own domain. For example, if I visit Google.com. So, you can see here Google.com.
6:33
Google.com. This is a small trick of browsers which increases confusion for us. So, people can see Google.com.
6:39
You can also see Google.com. But if I click here once. So, let's see what URL can be seen.
6:45
HTTPS www.google.com. So, although every URL prefix property is a part of some domain.
6:53
But when it will open, it will be a URL prefix property. So, now the question arises that what should we connect?
7:00
We should connect both. What will be the use of both? You will understand this gradually. Now, all the websites I visit.
7:07
Whenever I get an audit. A new client signs up. Someone provides me access to their website. To show.
7:13
For help. Either they have a URL prefix property. Or they have made a domain property by watching a new tutorial.
7:19
Which is a wrong approach. If you have a website example.com. So, you have to link the domain property too.
7:26
That is example.com. And you have to link the URL prefix property too.
7:32
Now, what will be the URL prefix property? It depends on the structure of your website. It is possible that you or your client have made a property by www.
7:40
So, you can connect it. It is possible that your website owner or client or boss. Did not use www.
7:47
So, you have to use HTTPS example.com. You go and visit your website. After visiting, click here like this.
7:54
See which URL you can see. If it is with www. So, you have to connect with www. If it is not with www.
8:01
So, you have to connect without it. But you have to connect the URL prefix property too. And domain name property.
8:07
It is very important to connect both. Okay. So, now we come back to Google Search Console.
8:13
And after coming here. We see that we have to connect this domain property. The process of connecting the domain property.
8:19
It is a little different. I will explain. So, here we have to enter our domain. Which we want to connect with Google Search Console.
8:25
So, I will enter my domain here. Delhibelly.site Funny name.
8:31
Delhibelly.site Here we are entering instead of domain. We will not enter in URL prefix property. I promise.
8:37
I am verifying the domain first. So that the work of URL prefix is easy. You will have to work very hard.
8:44
To verify the URL prefix once. Once if it becomes domain. So, here I have entered the domain. And then after that I will click on the continue button.
8:53
Let it check for verification. It will verify once. Whether you own this domain or not. Why is verification important?
8:59
So that you can go and verify any website. In Google Search Console. Because Google can't do this.
9:06
That's why it asks for verification from you. What is the method of verification? That you have to add a record to this domain. Delhibelly.site Which I am saying is my domain.
9:13
You have to add a record to its records. To verify. So, the method of adding a record here.
9:20
That is TXT. For those who are new. It may be a little difficult for them. You may find the process a little tricky.
9:26
But it's very simple. You just follow the steps. So, here is the TXT record. I am using this method. If you click here.
9:32
You will also see the CNAME. But we use CNAME to create a sub-domain. What is a sub-domain? We will find out later.
9:38
Let's not talk about it now. Let's keep the TXT record selected. And come down here. Here you can see the particular TXT record.
9:44
Which you have to link. Which you have to use. So, we click on the copy button here. Okay.
9:51
Now, I will go to my domain panel. Where this domain has been registered.
9:57
I have to manage the domain there. I'll click on the Manage button. So, now I'll come to the panel where the domain has been registered.
10:05
This process can be different for some hosting providers, but if your website is already hosted on a C-Panel hosting, which 70-80% of hosting providers already provide, all the steps will be the same there.
10:16
The big steps will be the same. If you still feel any problem, then go to your hosting or the domain where you have registered, go to their support, chat with them, tell them that this is my TXT record,
10:26
I have to add this to the website, then they will add it. It's not a very complicated process. Now, I'll search for the zone here.
10:33
I'll search for the zone, I'll see the zone editor. I'll select the zone editor. After this, I'll have to find my website.
10:41
This is my dailybelly.website. In front of this dailybelly website, I have to click on this Manage button.
10:46
Okay. We have clicked on the Manage button. Now, we have the option to create different records here. Let's click on this button called Add Record, or click on the arrow here, and then Add TXT Record. These are the simplest types of records.
10:59
Here, you can see different records that have different purposes. For example, if we use A record, then we can redirect a particular URL to a specific IP address.
11:10
We use MX record when we create email-related records. We use CNAME record when we have to create a separate sub-domain.
11:18
We use CAA record. I don't know because I have never made it. It's not necessary for SEO.
11:23
Okay. So, let's click on TXT record. You should keep accepting if you don't know anything.
11:29
Right? It's more important to not know than to know, so that if you get a chance to learn in the future, you don't have the ego in your mind that I won't learn.
11:36
I know everything. If I cancel this process here for 2 seconds, and again, instead of looking for this A record button,
11:42
I directly click on Add Record, then you can select this type from here, TXT.
11:47
Okay. We come to TXT record. Now, we have to paste the same value that we copied from here instead of the record. It's very easy to learn.
11:57
Nothing is complicated here. You won't hurt anything. I will tell you in advance if there is any risky thing. So, keep an empty mind and learn easily.
12:05
So, we copied it here. After copying, we came back to our zone editor. Here, we pasted the record.
12:10
Just keep in mind that we have to make this type TXT. Okay. After this, I am going backwards.
12:16
The importance is the same. So, here comes the TTL value. TTL is not a very complicated thing.
12:22
TTL means Time To Live. This means that the record that you are pasting, if you remove it tomorrow, then how long it will be active, it will be removed after that.
12:31
This value is in seconds. So, if I paste 1 second here, right? And after making the record here,
12:37
I come back tomorrow and delete it from here. So, this system of your hosting company, it will allow you to keep it for 1 second. After 1 second, it will start making the change.
12:46
So, this is given because sometimes there are sensitive records. Suppose, if you want to undo something tomorrow, you will get some time.
12:52
But here, we will minimize this value. Different hosting providers have different values here.
12:57
Let's say, this hosting has limited this value to 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, for this many seconds.
13:04
You can make it this much, no problem. But I always prefer to minimize this value. So, I will set it to 300.
13:10
Why am I setting it to 300? 300 means 5 minutes. Most of the hosting companies minimize the 300 value.
13:16
The premium hosting companies give you the option to set it to 10, 12 seconds. But there is no need for that and it doesn't make a big difference.
13:22
So, we will set it to 300 here. After this, comes the name. Now, what is this zone name? Here, the name is not given.
13:29
There is no name here. Correct? This is not problematic. Because whenever we put a name for a TXT record, it has to be for the entire domain. You have to verify the entire domain.
13:39
That's why we have to enter the entire domain name here. Some hosting companies, again, if you make it at the rate, then they automatically make it effective for the entire domain.
13:48
Some hosting providers don't do this. So, we come here and type our domain name.
13:53
DelhiBelly.site As it is, type it. No need to type www or https.
13:59
Just type it as it is. Now, I will click on the save record button. Here, I can see the error.
14:04
We have already added this record for another account. Its value is 14,400.
14:10
Now, I am trying to use 300 and I can see the error. So, I will have to set this value to 14,400.
14:17
But you can also use 300 if you are establishing this value for a new domain. After doing this again, I will click on the save record button.
14:24
And this record will be saved here. Done. Now, when you come to the zone record and add a new record for a new domain, it takes time for it to propagate.
14:36
It takes time for this information to reach all the servers in the world. So, I come back to the Google Search Console.
14:42
And here, I have to click on the verify button. I click on it. Maybe, it will show verified here.
14:49
Which it did. Sometimes, it happens that if your domain registrar or hosting company has a low budget, then it may take some time for them to propagate that change.
14:59
If it takes time, then you don't have to worry. You can check it after a while, after 5 minutes, after 10 minutes, or after an hour.
15:07
Then it will be done. There is no problem in this. Here, I click on the done button. And here, I am on this screen.
15:13
If I had clicked on go to property, then I could have gone to the property. I clicked on the done button so that I can show you how to go to the property.
15:20
If I click here, on this button, search property dailybelly.site. Let's click on it.
15:25
Here, you will see this page. There is no information. Because there is no traffic on this website.
15:32
There is no website on this domain. Now, I had promised you that you can easily make the HTTPS properties.
15:40
So, I come back here. I will click on this drop-down. If I click on the add property button, I will see the same prop up again.
15:46
This time, we will add the value HTTPS www.dailybelly.site.
15:55
I click on the continue button. Let's wait. And it is already verified. Now, I have not used any method of verification here.
16:03
Why didn't I use it? Because there is no need. If you have verified the domain, then you don't need to verify the other parts separately.
16:11
Everything is verified automatically. If I didn't do this process, if I didn't verify the domain, then I would have to go and upload the file, etc.
16:21
I would have to do a lot of methods. And if you want to know these methods, then there is a special video in which this process has been shown.
16:28
You can go and watch that video. I won't do it now. Because in today's date, if you want to do SEO, if you want to use Google Search Console, then you should add the domain property as well as the URL prefix property.
16:41
So, you verify the domain property. And after that, you connect the URL prefix property.
16:46
Only then the steps will be complete. I will finish it. We are here. You can see the HTTPS www.delhibelly.site in the drop-down.
16:55
Now, when you connect your website to your domain for the first time, it is possible that you will see a small clock here.
17:01
We will put another screenshot here in editing. This means that you have connected this website to Google Search Console for the first time.
17:08
It will take time for Google to collect the data and show it to you. So, Google keeps collecting data related to your website, but it doesn't start showing it.
17:18
It will start showing it only when you connect to Google Search Console for the first time. Connect to any Google Search Console.
17:24
Now, I can't see the clock here because I created this domain around 26th May.
17:31
Then I must have connected it with some other demo account. So, since then, I can see the data here.
17:36
Now, the fact that the data is zero is a different thing because the website is not created yet. I don't think the website is created yet.
17:41
Yes, the website is not created yet. So, there will be traffic. Right? Neither will there be Navmantel, nor will Radha dance. So, here you can see an empty dashboard.
17:50
Now, what will I show you in an empty dashboard? That's why we will connect another website to this account so that I can show you how to use Google Search Console with some data.
18:00
So, now we have connected a small bakery website to this account and we will use its data to continue this class.
18:09
Now, here you can see that I have connected two properties. I have connected the domain property and the website as it is.
18:17
It is a small bakery website and it is based in Canada. We will use it. Now, here you can see that this dashboard looks very overwhelming on its own.
18:24
If you are using Google Search Console for the first time in this field, it will look very daunting.
18:30
There are a lot of different properties. You can also see the graph. If you had to read so much, then why didn't you do it? There will be all these doubts.
18:35
But, actually, this is very simple and you have to learn it. Use it until you get it right.
18:41
Now, when you land on Google Search Console for the first time on any website, the first page that you see here, which will be your landing page, will be this Overview dashboard. Overview means that you get a snapshot of all the situations, conditions,
18:55
directions, etc. of this website. First of all, I am ignoring this part as well. First of all, you can see the performance here.
19:02
This is the performance of the last three months. This means that in the last three months, you can see how many clicks this website is getting per day.
19:09
So, in the last three months, the total number of clicks it has got is 6,159. Okay? This is the total number of web search clicks it has got.
19:16
After this, let's come down and see. You will see the recommendations. This means that this website is related to Google. Some of the important messages of Google, what to do, what to pay attention to, what is good and what is bad, you can see the automatic recommendations of Google here.
19:28
Some people will see less, some people will see more. There are different methods and meanings. Let's leave it. As soon as we come back down, we can see Indexing.
19:36
This means that how many pages of this website have been indexed by Google. We talked about Indexing, when Google saves a copy of the pages of your website.
19:47
If Google does not save a copy, then it will not even rank. You will not even get traffic.
19:52
Now we know that 32 pages of your website have not been indexed and 71 pages have been indexed.
19:58
Okay? Is it clear so far? This is also a status of 3 months. Let's come down to experience, that is, what is the user's experience about this website.
20:08
Now I will not talk about the speed of the website, because it will be a little tough for our new students.
20:16
Let's keep it easy. Experience means, let's say, we opened this website, Nidha Street, how soon is it opening?
20:24
If a website opens too late, then people will not like it. They will not spend much time on it.
20:30
They will have to wait. Who wants to wait these days? So Google does not give good rank to such slow websites.
20:38
So if you want your website to have a good rank, then the website should be fast.
20:44
Now how many pages of your website does Google think are fast? How many pages are not fast?
20:50
All these things can be found here in the experience section. After this, there is an overview related to structure data.
20:58
Now we will open all these sections and see in detail. There are many options, but now you have to understand that the overview tab always gives you an overview.
21:10
But we don't spend too much time here. Once you learn Google Search Console, you will never pay attention to the overview tab.
21:18
It is important to understand that many times students, even experienced SEOs, don't know the real traffic.
21:26
Some say Google Search Console, some say Google Analytics. But the truth is in the middle.
21:32
Neither Google Search Console nor Google Analytics have it. Here it is seen that in the last three months, 6,159 clicks have been received on nidastreet.ca.
21:44
This does not mean that 6,159 people have come. Maybe people have clicked more than once on your website.
21:52
This is just the data of web search clicks. What does this mean? Let's say I come to Google Search and search nidastreet.
22:00
I search the word nidastreet. And here their website is visible in the search results.
22:06
Correct? This website is visible in the search results. If I click on this result here, as soon as I click,
22:13
I have clicked from the Google Search results page. So this is one click here. Now these will not be 6,159 clicks, but 6,160 clicks.
22:21
Because I just clicked after searching. If I click back and click again, then it will be 6,161 clicks.
22:29
This is a click. But when a user comes to a website, he does not just go by looking at the homepage.
22:35
If I click on one of these cakes and visit an internal page, then the counter will not increase here.
22:43
Because Google Search Console has data only from Google Search. From Google Search,
22:49
I clicked only for this homepage. Once when I clicked on one page, I came inside, then Google Search will not get the information now.
22:57
Now here if I click on 50, 60, 100 pages on this website, and keep looking at those pages, then you will not get that information here.
23:05
That internal traffic information you get in another tool called Google Analytics, which we will learn later.
23:11
Here you get only from Google Search. So it is possible that 5,000 people have seen 25,000 pages on your website.
23:17
But here you will see 6,159 only. Because this is the amount that you get from Google Search.
23:25
It is important to be this clear. It is possible that tomorrow on your website, if a website owner says that my server bill is increasing a lot.
23:33
My server is telling me that 25,000 people are coming to me. But you are saying that only 6,159 clicks are happening on Google Search Console.
23:41
This means that 6,159 people have entered inside, and have seen more pages.
23:47
Some have seen 2, some have seen 3, some have seen 10 pages. So the number is increasing. Total traffic is a different thing.
23:53
Total page views is a different thing. And the traffic coming from Google Search is a different thing. There is one more metric here that we should keep in mind, which is impression.
24:03
What is impression? Once I come to Google Search and search for any keyword,
24:09
I can see my URL here. It is possible that I click on it. If I had clicked on it, it would have been an impression.
24:15
Just an impression. If I click on it, it is both an impression and a click. It won't be an impression.
24:21
It is both an impression and a click. So let's go back to Google Search Console. You can see the overview tab here.
24:27
After overview, there is insight and URL inspection. We won't see this now. Let's come to the performance tab.
24:33
In some websites, you will see only one tab for performance. In some websites,
24:39
Google search results and Google News will be there. In some websites, you will see Google News along with Discover.
24:47
So there can be a section here or there can be a lot of options in the section. Right now, I will click on Google Search results.
24:53
It is possible that you will see only the performance tab here. Now this is the first page which is very important for you in Google Search Console.
25:01
It tells you how well your website is doing in Google Search. Now on this tab, you can see the 3-month data.
25:09
In the overview tab, you can see the 3-month data. The default date range of Google Search Console is 3 months.
25:17
You can also see the filter here. Before coming to the filter, let's see some major candidates.
25:23
Click, you can see the number of times people click on this website's URL.
25:29
What is the impression? The number of times your website's URL is visible. After this, comes CTR.
25:35
Average CTR. If Google is showing your website 100 times, then how many times are people clicking on it?
25:43
For this website, the average CTR is 1.2%. When all the URLs of this website are shown 100 times on the Google Search results page, then only 1.2 times people click on it.
25:57
After this, comes the average position. For any page of this website, for any keyword, what is the position on this number?
26:07
It's 10.2. I just searched for Nidha Street. It's the brand keyword.
26:13
If I search for another keyword tomorrow, and there is another rank for that keyword, then it keeps increasing or decreasing the average position.
26:21
The word average position shows the average position for all the URLs of this website.
26:27
You can see clicks, impressions, average CTR, and position.
26:33
We usually don't look for the whole website because that number will always be less. If you see, the average position of my website is 10, but your impressions will be more.
26:43
For some keywords, you might be in the 14th position. So, the average position number automatically goes down.
26:49
Don't focus on this. It's important to see clicks and impressions. You can see some filters on this.
26:55
If you want to see the data of the last 24 hours, then we will click on 24 hours. 55 clicks, 4.8 impressions.
27:01
If you want to see the data of 7 days, then you can click on 7, 28 days, and so on.
27:07
If you want to see the data of more than 3 months, then click on the more button. 6, 12, 16.
27:13
You won't get data of more than 16 months in Google Search Console. When we come to the advanced topics of Google Search Console, we will tell you how you can save the data.
27:23
For now, we get options for 6, 12, and 16 months. For example, if I click on 16 months,
27:29
I will get the data of the last 16 months. I will get the data of clicks, impressions, average CTR, average position, and so on.
27:39
Okay? Let's come to the second option. Apart from seeing the traffic, we also have the option of comparing.
27:47
For example, if you want to compare the last 24 hours with the last 24 hours, then you can use this.
27:55
If you want to compare the last 24 hours with the last 24 hours, then you can click on this button.
28:01
Let's say, this previous period and year-over-year can be a little confusing.
28:09
For example, if I come to 28 days, I will compare the last 28 days.
28:15
Right now, we are shooting on 27th August. If I select this option,
28:21
Google will compare between two ranges. One will compare the data from 1st August to 28th August.
28:29
The other will compare the data between the same time in July.
28:35
If I select compare last 28 days to year-over-year, it will mean that the data from 1st August to 28th August 2025 will be compared with the data from 1st August to 28th August 2024.
28:51
This is the meaning of year-over-year. Both these options are important because sometimes, some business are seasonal.
29:01
Let's say, you have a catering business or a banquet hall business. When there is a wedding, there is traffic.
29:09
If you compare October, November, December traffic with March, April, May or July, August, September, you will see less traffic because they pick more traffic during the season.
29:23
In such businesses, we do year-over-year comparison. Now, you can select the date and period you want to compare.
29:33
Click on the apply button. Now, you can compare the data you saw.
29:39
In the 28 days before this website, the traffic was 1.9 thousand and in the last 28 days, it was 1.81 thousand.
29:49
Impressions are less and traffic is also less. If you want to add FSCTR, you can click on it and remove the impression or the average position. You can also see the value of one of these or all the four values at the same time, it all depends on you.
30:08
Now you can see how fresh the data is. Here you can see a small information about when the data was updated.
30:17
But before coming to this, we have to see two more filters. Here we have seen filters in the date range. You do not get this specific date range, you can also select date and time here.
30:28
By selecting date and time, you can see the performance of a particular website on a specific date. For example, let's say I do not want to see these 28 days, 3 months, etc.
30:37
I want to compare July's data with June. I do not want to do all this. So I come here, what will be my start date? 1st July.
30:47
Okay. And then what will be the end date? 31st July. I want to compare this with June's data.
30:54
So I come here and select June. 1st June. And then my end date will be 30th June.
31:05
Here it says year 2025. I bring it back to June. I have selected June. So here we are comparing data from 1st July to 31st July.
31:14
Data from 1st June to 30th June. Click on the Apply button. A good comparison of June and July is ready in front of me.
31:22
So in June, we only had 2.02K clicks. But in July, we had 2.12K clicks.
31:29
Okay. So in this way, you can see the exact monthly data frame and time frame. On its side, we have some other filters.
31:37
The first filter is Search Type. If we come to Google Search, you can see that I have searched for Dhaa Street.
31:43
But here, one is All, which means all the results will be visible at once. Or here are images.
31:49
Shopping. Video. Short video. News. More. A lot more.
31:55
Okay. So here we come back to Google Search Console. You can also see some options here. Web. Image.
32:01
Video. News. If you want to see how much the total web traffic results match with the image results, how much is less or more, if you want to do a comparison, you can see from here.
32:16
The Compare tab is here. But for now, let's filter. We want to see how much traffic we get from the images, not from the website. So I selected the image.
32:22
I clicked on the Apply button. Now I am being shown the data of this date range, June and July, but only the traffic coming from the image.
32:32
Okay. Now this is not important for every website. There are some websites where there are more images, where the images are more useful.
32:39
For example, let's say you do wedding photography, travel photography, there are a lot of images on your website. And you want to see how much traffic you are getting from those images.
32:46
And is that traffic increasing or decreasing? So you can use this filter here. Or you can also compare. If you want to compare your image and video traffic, then you will select the image once, then the video, click on the Apply button, and you will get a comparison.
33:02
You will get a comparison of the data between your image and video traffic. They are not getting any traffic from the video.
33:09
Now let's go back to the search type, so that we have more data. And you can see some filters here.
33:16
Filters are very useful. I will select this filter here. After selecting the filter, you will see that there are different types here.
33:23
There is query, page type, country, device, and search appearance. I will come down a little bit here.
33:30
And let's see. Below this graph, you can see some buttons here. Query, page, country, device. What is this? Let's come down.
33:36
I will only show the query for now. Here you can see that one query is Nidha Street. For Nidha Street, in the last three months, here three months are selected.
33:43
How many clicks did you get in three months? 104. Total clicks are 6.16. Total clicks are 6,159.
33:50
But how many clicks did you get for which keyword? This is important to see. Out of these total 6,159 clicks, you got 104 clicks for the Nidha Street keyword.
34:01
Many people may have searched Nidha Street many times. But only 303 times Google has shown the link of this website.
34:11
And out of that, people have clicked 104 times. Showed 303 times. Clicked 104 times.
34:18
Similarly, the other keyword which I can't read at all. My Hindi medium will get confused while reading this. May get confused.
34:24
But for this keyword, Google has shown the link of our website 914 times.
34:30
Out of that, clicked 71 times. Similarly, for different keywords, the website has been shown many different times.
34:36
You also got clicks. Okay? This is the number. If I want to see how many times the website got impressions or clicks for a particular query,
34:49
I can use these filters. I can use these filters. Clicked on Add Filter button.
34:55
Clicked on Query. After clicking on Query, I can search here. Let's say, Nidha's.
35:01
I didn't put Nidha Street. I just put Nidha's. Here you can see another filter. Query containing.
35:08
If I click on Query containing and click on Apply button, it will show the result for all those queries which have the word Nidha's.
35:18
May be it's Nidha Street. May be it's Nidha's. May be it's Nidha Street Review. Because Nidha's is common among these three.
35:26
Okay? If I come back here, it's Query containing. It should be in any query.
35:33
If I make it Query not containing and then apply, I will get the traffic for all the other keywords.
35:40
Only those with Nidha's will be removed. That is, any query which has the word Nidha's will not be shown in the report.
35:47
The rest will be shown. So if you want to see how much traffic I get for my own brand keyword,
35:53
I will select Query containing and enter my brand name. If I want to see how much traffic I get other than branded,
36:01
I will click on Query not containing. But what if I only want this word. It's not like Nidha's Street, Nidha's Street Review,
36:09
Nidha's Street Location, Address. No. I want to see how much traffic I get only for Nidha's word. So I come here and click on the Exact Query button.
36:18
Now the traffic I get is only for this particular word. For Nidha's. Right? Now Nidha's Street is gone.
36:25
Nidha's Street Review is gone. Only Nidha's is left. So this is the meaning of Query here and the filter given with Query.
36:32
We will not show the custom one now. Because Regex will become one level up. It will become complex.
36:38
We have a series of Regex related tutorials. There are 3-4 videos. You can see their link in the top right corner.
36:44
Those of you who are advanced and come from a programming background, you can go and watch it. But the rest, the new students can avoid it.
36:52
You don't need it now. Okay? Let's cancel it here. Let's remove it. After this, if we click on the Add filter, then the page comes.
37:02
The page is also the same. That is, the page, the URL of the website, has different words in the URL.
37:08
For example, let's say there are cakes. On the cake, there is a Birthday Cake page. Now its URL is nidhasstreet.ca slash birthday-cake.
37:17
If I come to the other cake, eggless cake, then here it is nidhasstreet.ca slash delicious eggless cakes and so on.
37:26
So here, if I want to see how much traffic a particular page has received or how much traffic a particular word URL has received, then I can use it here.
37:37
For example, if I come here and copy this URL exactly and then paste it here and then click on the Apply button, then I will get to see the traffic of this page.
37:49
In the last three months, for different queries, the page is the same. Right? The page is the same.
37:55
Because we have put a whole page here. Now here too, the URL containing is written. URL containing, exact URL.
38:01
Similarly, query containing, query not containing, exact query. So in query containing, you are getting only one URL data because this is one.
38:09
If here, this keyword, we would have one more page, dash two, then we would get two pages of data because this much data is already available.
38:18
But this is not the case. So we come here and if, let's say, we want to see data of such URLs in which somewhere the word cake has come.
38:27
So I will come here and remove everything from this URL containing. I will just write cake. You will get the data of all the URLs in which the word cake will come.
38:35
So I have left the URL containing selected. I have clicked on the apply button. And now let's see how many pages are there here.
38:43
NidhaasTreat.ca What cakes are healthy? Now this is written cakes, but there are C-A-K-E.
38:49
Something can happen before that, something can happen behind that, something will happen before that, something will happen later, but if the URL is in C-A-K-E then that URL will be shown in the report.
39:02
There are a lot of 62 URLs here which contain the word cake. If I change it a little bit here,
39:08
I will change it to cakes. So now see this cake word, this URL nidhaastreat.ca slash types of wedding cake, not cakes, will be removed from here.
39:19
As soon as I clicked on the apply button, 1, 2, 3, cake is removed.
39:26
Let's remove it once. We come to another filter which is country.
39:32
What does the country filter do? I clicked on country, for different countries.
39:39
Now here we do not get the option to add the country. We cannot make the name of the country imaginary, right? So here we can see how much traffic is coming from a particular country.
39:55
So the function of share is here also. If you want to see how is the traffic between two countries, for example, if you want to see the traffic, then here you can click on share.
40:12
You can also see the traffic between two countries. For example, if you want to see the traffic between two countries, you can This website is of an Indian owner, but the website is in Canada. So, I want to see what is the traffic between Canada and India. So, I selected Canada here, and India is typed
40:20
below. Now, when I click on the Apply button, I will get a comparison of the traffic between India and Canada. So, it is a 3-month data. Click from Canada, the total is 1.4, and 330 from India. Because the website is in Canada, it is a small website of a bakery, so you will get more from there.
40:28
So, there is not much difference in impressions, it is 39,000 impressions, but the click is less. Because the website is of Canada.
40:34
So, this country filter gives us the facility to see and compare traffic for different countries.
40:41
Similarly, we can also see the device, how much traffic your website is getting from the desktop, how much from the mobile, how much from the tablet, you can see all the data here.
40:49
So, if we select Desktop here and apply, then this number will be reduced, because every website gets very little traffic from the desktop.
40:57
Similarly, if you want to compare how much traffic you are getting between the desktop and the mobile, then we click on the Apply button here.
41:04
We will get to know that this website has got 5.17,000 clicks from the mobile in the last 3 months, and only 796 clicks from the desktop.
41:13
This is the same for every website. So, we can use these filters in this way and compare different features.
41:22
The last option here is Search Appearance. Let's see this too. You have seen the device. Let's come to Search Appearance. Translated Product, Product Snippets, Review Snippets.
41:29
Out of these, where is this website appearing the most? Now, what is this specifically? When we will see the SEO course further, then you will understand more.
41:40
That's why I will leave this topic for now. But if you want to see the review snippets of your website, you can see the review box below.
41:50
If I search here, Shoes for Men, you can see the star value here.
41:59
This is an ad. If we come to Organic Results, you can see the page of Myntra, and you can see the star rating here.
42:06
So, how much traffic is there? How many clicks are there? To get such star rating pages, review snippets, you get such information from here.
42:14
But then again, this will be very advanced. That's why we won't go into this topic for now. Let's leave this option too.
42:21
You can see that you can compare more than one filter. So, for example, I have put a cake filter here, URL containing.
42:27
After this, I can put another filter, which can be a query filter. Let's say, Nidhaas. So, I can match two different filters here and get the information.
42:37
Google Search Console is very flexible. It gives you options to use it in different ways. So, our performance section is almost done.
42:44
There are a few things left. Before coming down from this graph, you can see 2-3 icons here at the top.
42:51
And if we don't keep them in any section, then it looks a bit lacking. That's why I'll show them quickly. The bell icon you can see here, you can guess, is the notification icon.
43:00
So, it's not really that important. And when you work for many years, you will remember that you haven't clicked here for a long time.
43:06
Like I haven't clicked here for a long time. Because when you become an expert in Search Console, then you don't have to look here again and again.
43:13
You can find out by yourself. On the notification side, you can see the user settings. And these are not the settings of your account.
43:19
These are just the notification settings. So, here you can see the email preferences. If you click on this after coming here, then you can see only one option here.
43:28
Email notification. If you want, you can turn it off. But this is a disadvantage. The only small annoyance is that between 1st to 5th, on any particular date,
43:38
Google Search Console, will send you one email related to all your websites. Which sometimes makes your inbox feel full.
43:44
But apart from this, if you keep it on, then if there is any urgent email, any urgent notification, let's say, any email with a penalty, then you get it, which is very helpful.
43:54
So, keep it on. There is no harm in it. And then after this, Search Console and Search Results. This is basically a type of mechanism of Google Search Console, which shows the information related to your website in the search itself.
44:06
So, for example, if I search for nidahastreet.ca after coming to Google Search, then in the search results,
44:12
I can see the information related to Google Search Console as it is.
44:18
And this can be helpful sometimes. If you don't like this feature, then after coming here, for individual websites, you can turn this setting on and off.
44:26
But again, it's not that important. And I don't think I have used this feature in many websites.
44:32
So, you can leave it as it is. There is no problem. Here, in this entire tutorial, there will be some settings of Google Search Console which I will tell you very soon.
44:40
I won't explain them. Maybe there will be some things which I completely avoid. Because in my professional workflow, in my daily workflow,
44:48
I don't use them. And according to me, they are not useful. But if I leave any option, and if you want to know about it, then you can tell me in the comment section.
44:58
I will cover it in any video. But because I started using Google Search Console from that time when it was called Webmaster Tools.
45:05
And it's been many years now and there are many such settings which Google has added. But we never use them in our daily workflow.
45:11
We don't use them either. I mean, I don't use them and you won't use them either. But if you are curious, and which is a good thing, you can tell me in the comment section.
45:17
I will explain that too. Okay? You shouldn't be afraid of asking questions. When you get the answer after asking the question, and you don't remember the answer, you should be afraid of that.
45:26
So, we will come down from the bar chart here and you will see some tabs here. You have understood the queries till now.
45:32
These queries are not your keywords. There is a little confusion here. You must have heard the keyword many times.
45:38
The new students among you must have heard the keyword many times. Keyword is that thing which you want to try in your content.
45:46
Basically, you want to target. So, let's say that I come to this nidhasstreet.ca website.
45:53
And I come to this cakes section. And here is a birthday cake. Okay? So, here is a birthday cake.
46:00
How to host a birthday party with these remarkable birthday cakes. Okay? And then after this, you can see different headlines here.
46:09
So, you can see that the word birthday cakes is being repeated again and again. Because the SEO of this website wants to target the word birthday cakes.
46:18
So, what SEO targets is the keyword. Okay? But because SEO or website owner is targeting birthday cake, it is not necessary that the user will always search for birthday cakes.
46:28
It is possible that the user who is searching for Google can search for birthday cakes. Right? He can search for birthday cakes of different flavors.
46:36
He can search for cakes near me. He can search for cakes in Canada. He can search for anything. What does the user want? And Google wants to match the user's query, the user's question with your page.
46:46
If your page matches, your page will be visible in search results. Now, this is the thing. So, when you see a query here, query is the thing that people are searching for.
46:54
You have no control over this. Our control is only that we can see the healthiest cake query.
47:01
We can also see the healthy cake recipe query. So, if people are searching a lot for healthy cake, then why don't we go to our website and if there is no page with healthy cake, then I can make a healthy cake.
47:14
Right? If I make a healthy cake page for the query with healthy cake in which there is information related to healthy cake, then my website will start ranking.
47:23
It is a simple concept. It is a very simple logic. This is SEO. When people go to different sources, meet very big gurus and they will tell them semantics and then after this, they will tell them some tricks.
47:37
Then they will say, make 1500 backlinks, go and do it here. Then you forget this basic concept. That's all there is to search.
47:43
The concept is only this. Provide what the user wants. Right? A shopkeeper.
47:49
SEO comes mostly to local shopkeepers. There is a shopkeeper. Someone goes to the shopkeeper. The customer will go again and again.
47:55
He will ask for a special type of spice. He will ask for a special type of spice. He will put 4-5 stalks of the same spice in front of the shop.
48:01
Because he knows give the customer what he is asking for. Now, if the customer is coming to ask for a special type of spice and you are saying,
48:08
I have this special trick. If you mix these three different chemicals, the spice will be made. The customer will run away.
48:15
This is what we are doing in SEO. Provide the customer what he wants, the search engine what he wants. That is simple.
48:21
So, let's come back to our topic. Here you can see the queries. For these queries, you always have to identify.
48:28
So, here you can see the list of queries. You can see the click, you can see the impression. But how to use this?
48:34
The meaning of this table is that in the last three months when people searched for
48:40
Nidha Street World, then Google has shown 318 times, 318 times to some page of this website.
48:49
Okay. We don't know which page it has shown. Here we only know for this particular query, in three months.
48:56
So, in three months, all the people who searched for Nidha Street, anywhere in the world, the pages of Nidha Street, any page, has been shown 318 times, 318 times in Google Search Results.
49:08
Out of that, 109 times people have clicked on any URL. Okay.
49:14
Now, this is the keyword. I don't know how to pronounce it. So, I will leave it. I will definitely leave it. The third query here is
49:21
Healthy Cake Recipes. That means, in the last three months, people from all over the world have searched for
49:27
Healthy Cake Recipes 2276 times to some page of Nidha Street.
49:36
And when 2276 times has been shown, then people have clicked 66 times.
49:43
This is the basic understanding. Okay. Now, the question arises that okay, Nidha Street was searched
49:49
or the query of Nidha Street was shown 318 times on Google. But when 318 times has been shown, then which pages have been shown?
49:58
This can also be a question. How will we find out? Now, when we click on it, it will take some time and you will see the figure here.
50:08
The 318th time shown is for which particular date? Average CTR means click-through date.
50:15
When it was shown 100 times, how many times did people click on it? When it was shown 100 times, Nidha Street's pages were clicked 34.3 times.
50:23
What was the position? Number 1. Because it is our keyword brand name, not a big deal. Let's scroll down a bit. Here you can see the list of pages.
50:30
There is only one query in queries. Because we clicked on Nidha Street, there is only one query. Let's see the pages.
50:36
Home page is being shown. Contact Us page is being shown. Pricing Flavor page is being shown. About Us.
50:42
Again Pricing Flavor. I think there are 2 pages. Pricing-Flavor, Pricing and Flavor.
50:48
Then there is Gallery. There are 18 pages in total which are being shown.
50:54
18 pages are being shown for this one word and people are clicking on it. So we got to know what all scenarios are there.
51:01
Now when we clicked on Query, see what actually happened. Here the query filter was set automatically.
51:08
So even if you didn't click here, you could still see the query after clicking.
51:14
Now this is the exact query. Because if you contain the query, then apart from Nidha Street, you can also see Nidha Street Near Me, Best Nidha Street, Cakes of Nidha Street, all the random keywords are also visible.
51:25
We just needed the exact query. Now I will remove the filter again so that I can come back to the main page.
51:31
So here we can see the top queries, clicks and impressions on this table.
51:39
If you want to see the CTR and Average Position too, then click on both of them. They will come down automatically.
51:46
It came automatically by magic. Now the table that is being sorted here is sorted on the basis of clicks.
51:53
First of all, the queries with the most clicks are being shown. If you want to see which are the keywords with the most impressions, then click on Impressions.
52:02
So which query is getting the most impressions here? When people are searching for Eggless Cakes Near Me, then Nidha Street is getting a lot of impressions.
52:10
But the CTR and clicks are very less because maybe the position will be very low. Or maybe you will have to send Eggless Cakes Near Me.
52:18
One of the two can happen. Now if you want to see which query is getting the least impressions, then click on Impressions again and the table will flip.
52:28
Ascending and Descending, everything happens here. It is not written but it works like this. Okay.
52:34
Now you have understood the similarity. If you want to sort on the basis of CTR, then you can click on this. If you want to sort on the basis of position, then you can click on this.
52:42
However you want to see. We have to see the position a little bit upside down here. Because if the position is 85, then it is not much.
52:48
If the impression is more in number and volume, then it is better to have a good impression volume. Impressions should always be seen as less as possible.
52:54
Clicks should always be seen as less as possible. CTR should always be seen as less as possible. Position should always be seen as more as possible. That is, you will see 100 out of 1 and not 100 out of 1.
53:01
Okay. You don't have to come down in the list. So this is the Query tab. After this comes the Page tab. Now after coming to the Page tab, it is the same thing.
53:08
Like I just showed you here that this Birthday Cake page can be shown for a lot of queries.
53:14
Now how to find out? So either we cut it from here. After cutting, let's see where the Birthday Cake page is.
53:21
Whichever page you click on, you will find out for which queries that page is being shown in Google search.
53:28
Just like you find out the page for a query, the same way you will find out the query for the page. See here, which queries this page is being shown for.
53:36
Okay. So now, similarly, we had copied the link of this page. So we come here.
53:42
We will come to the filter. And we will remove the link of this page. We will paste our link. It is important to have the exact URL.
53:49
Click on the Apply button. So now we will find out which queries our Birthday Cake page is being shown for.
53:56
Right. It is being shown here for these queries. Cool. Now I will click out again.
54:02
After this, the next tab is Countries. The method is the same. It is simple. It is a website of Canada. Maybe. Maybe not.
54:08
It is a website of Canada. But maybe you want to see that in the United States, in America, which queries are being performed better for which pages.
54:17
That is, if we go and see now, we have selected all the countries. So the Nidha Street keyword is coming with the most click.
54:25
Who is bringing the most impression? Eggless Cakes Near Me. But maybe you want to target the US as well. Which query is performing the best in the US?
54:32
So we will click on the United States here. And after clicking, again the filter is set there.
54:38
Okay. After this, we come here in Queries. Now let's see which query is performing the best. Now Healthy Cake is performing.
54:44
Eggless Cakes Near Me. Canada is performing. Canada has become more vegetarian. We want to see Healthy Cake in the US.
54:50
So it is shown there as well. Now the impressions are very good. But the clicks are less. Because the position of the site will be very down.
54:59
Right. So you have understood the meaning of the Country tab as well. Now let's come back. Here we can see the Device tab as well.
55:05
There is Search Appearance and Dates. Dates tab is very less needed. You are not going to use it. So I am not going to explain it.
55:11
In Search Appearance, you will not be able to see it so well in this website. I will give you a demo of some other website as well.
55:18
We will see in the parts coming in the class. There you will be able to see more clearly. After coming to Devices, you can see that most of the users are coming from mobile.
55:26
But there is no specific term in Desktop which is performing better on Desktop. And the example I am giving here is of a bakery website.
55:35
Maybe your website is a heavy machinery industry related website. Where a lot of users come from Desktop.
55:41
There are corporate users. Maybe there is a SaaS platform which runs on Desktop only. Maybe your website is related to an accounting software.
55:48
There a lot of your clientele will come from Desktop. There we have to see which user is coming from mobile.
55:54
After coming from mobile, what will the user search? If your SaaS platform is a website, an accounting software, a business related product or service, then most of the users should come from Desktop.
56:03
But if they are coming from mobile, it means they are sitting at home and searching in their free time. So what term are they using? So you can get answers to such unique questions from this tab.
56:12
So let's see, when a user is searching from Desktop, which query is searching more? So I have put a filter on Desktop.
56:18
After that it came to Query. I click on Impression again. Types of Cakes. People are searching for Types of Cakes more from Desktop.
56:25
So the page that we will make for Types of Cakes, will be more Desktop oriented. There will be more images.
56:31
There will be the functionality of zooming images. People want to see how many different types of cakes are there.
56:37
What is their quality? Is there detailing or not? Etc. So you can get answers to such unique questions.
56:44
When you go through these filters, a question should be framed in your mind. In fact, there are only two aims of this entire course.
56:54
Number one, to tell you the tool. And number two, to tell you how to get answers from the tool.
57:00
This Google Search Console is a tool for you. Now we will learn Analytics, we will learn Google Tag Manager, we will learn Screaming Frog, we will learn InLinks.
57:06
We will learn Analytics Canvas. We have to learn a lot of software. We have to learn a lot of tools. But how to get answers from those tools, it will depend on your creativity.
57:15
The difference will be there. Anyone can access this class. It is available for free on YouTube. But who will benefit from it?
57:22
It depends on your creativity and your own concept. And the purpose of these live classes is that you interact with me in real time.
57:32
You have a habit of asking questions. The things that I can't plan here right now, your questions tell me.
57:38
And there I will tell you some strategy or some trick that is necessary to find answers from your questions.
57:45
To develop your habit. So, do join the membership. Now, here we have seen the countries, we have seen the device, we have seen the search appearance, but we will not go there now.
57:55
We will go to another Search Console class and see the other website and explain there. Now, you can see the Discover button below.
58:01
This is related to Google Discover. I will leave it now. I will show it in the context of a news website.
58:07
Because it is not possible for this particular website to come in Discover. Neither will it target Discover.
58:13
It is a bakery website, why will it not target Discover? By the way, you can target any website in Discover. But it is a very small business.
58:19
They don't have a budget. They are not trying. It must have come sometime. If a website has never come in Discover, then it will not be shown in the options here.
58:26
If you can't see it, it's fine. This website must have come sometime 4-6-8 months ago, 1 year ago. That's why it is visible here.
58:33
I will put a filter of 16 months. Look, I got 2 clicks. Now, because of these 2 clicks, it is visible in the menu here.
58:39
But it is there. Right? Let's come back here. Now, let's come to the pages section.
58:45
We have seen the performance. There will be 2-4 more advanced classes. We will see them in the search console. Now, let's come to the indexing status.
58:51
Okay? What is indexing? I come here and search nidhastreet.ca This website automatically opens.
58:59
Okay? But I cut it from here. I come to Google. And I search for it.
59:05
Exactly. By the way, there is another way to search. You are on the search bar. You type site and then colon.
59:11
And then you paste the URL. So, all the pages of this website will be indexed by Google.
59:17
This is called site operator. The old ones know what it is. They must be laughing. But those who are new, understand this thing.
59:23
This is site operator. Right? With this, we find out how many pages of our website has been indexed by Google.
59:30
Now, you can't see the numbers here. You can't see the numbers because Google has become a little sneaky. You have to click on tools here. After clicking on tools, you will know that there are 123 results.
59:38
That means, Google has indexed 123 pages of https://nidhasstreet.ca instead of https://nidhasstreet.ca of this website.
59:48
But this number is ballpark. In the case of a small website, it can be accurate or not.
59:54
It can be 122 pages. It can be 125 pages. This is a ballpark number. This is never accurate.

हेलो एवरीवन, आई एम तिवारी, फॉर तिवारी डॉट नेट और ये है एडवांस एसइओ कोर्स की नेक्स्ट क्लास। आज की इस क्लास में हम
0:06
Google सर्च कंसोल की लर्निंग को उसी की जर्नी को कंटिन्यू रखेंगे। आज की क्लास में हम Google सर्च कंसोल में आने वाली जो
0:12
इंडेक्सिंग रिलेटेड बाकी चैलेंजिस होते हैं उनको देखेंगे। उनको सॉल्व करने के तरीके समझेंगे। कैनोनिकल को समझेंगे एंड
0:18
साथ ही में हम देखेंगे कि साइट मैप आखिर क्या बला होती है। साइट मैप को Google सर्च कंसोल के अंदर कैसे हैंडल किया जाता
0:25
है। बट अगर आप इस पूरे कोर्स की सीरीज में पहली बार इस वीडियो को ही देख रहे हैं इसी क्लास को अटेंड कर रहे हैं तो अभी पॉज
0:32
करें। पुरानी जितनी भी क्लासेस हैं उनको अटेंड करें एंड देन इसके बाद इस क्लास पर आएं। ये पूरा कोर्स डिजाइन किया गया है एक
0:38
जर्नी की तरह। अगर आप फर्स्ट से लेकर लास्ट क्लास तक अटेंड करेंगे और नोट्स बनाएंगे और अपने डाउट्स को पूछेंगे तभी
0:44
जाकर आप इस कोर्स का पूरा फायदा उठा पाएंगे। हर एक क्लास में हर एक मिनट में कोई ना कोई एक ऐसी इंपॉर्टेंट बात आ रही
0:50
है जो मेरे अपने 14 इयर्स की लर्निंग मेरे अपने हजारों क्लाइंट्स के साथ में स्ट्रगल से निकली हुई कहानियां हैं। तो ये सभी के
0:57
सभी आपको हेल्प करने जा रही हैं। एक्सपीरियंस और नॉलेज में जो जो डिफरेंस होता है ये होता है नॉलेज बुक्स के अंदर
1:03
होता है और एक्सपीरियंस लोगों से स्ट्रगल करके मिलता है। तो वो जो मुझे एक्सपीरियंस मिला है वो आपको मिले। इसके लिए जरूरी है
1:09
कि आप सारी क्लासेस को एक-एक मिनट पूरा का पूरा अटेंड करें। आल्सो क्लास को अटेंड
1:14
करते-करते आपको अपने नोट्स बनाने हैं। अपने जो भी डाउट्स हैं उनको नोट करके रखना है अपनी नोटबुक में। एंड संडे को जो हमारी
1:21
लाइव डाउट सेशन होगा उसमें पूछना है। लाइव डाउट सेशन को अटेंड करने के लिए आपको इस चैनल को ज्वाइन करना पड़ेगा। फीस बड़ी
1:28
मामूली है ₹29 पर मंथ। सो चैनल को ज्वाइन करें और अगले लाइव सेशन को अटेंड करें। आप
1:33
ना सिर्फ अपने डाउट पूछेंगे बल्कि जो आपके बाकी दूसरे फेलो स्टूडेंट्स हैं उनके डाउट से भी आपको सीखने को मिलेगा। एक क्लास का
1:40
जो मजा है वो यही है कि आप सिर्फ अपनी गलती अपने नॉलेज से नहीं सीखते बल्कि अपने साथ वाले जो फेलो स्टूडेंट्स हैं उनसे भी
1:47
सीखते हैं। सो कनेक्ट करिए कम्युनिटी के साथ जुड़िए एंड एंजॉय करिए लाइव संडे क्लास एट ₹29 पर मंथ ओनली। सो ज्वाइन करें
1:54
आज ही। एंड अब नाउ हम चलते हैं कंप्यूटर स्क्रीन पर और इस क्लास को शुरू करते हैं।
2:00
[संगीत]
2:08
सो आप लोगों को 44 समझ में आ गया है। अगला जो इशू देखने को मिलता है हमें Google सर्च कंसोल में वो है सॉफ्ट 44। पेज मिला
2:15
नहीं। अब उसको सॉफ्ट कैसे कर सकते हैं? वेल सॉफ्ट 44 Google की स्पेसिफिक एरर है।
2:20
जैसे 44 होता है। ये एक http स्टेटस कोड है। यानी कि इसे हर सर्च इंजन या हर
2:25
सिस्टम 44 का मतलब यही समझेगा कि पेज नहीं मिला। लेकिन सॉफ्ट 44 Google का अपना टर्म
2:31
है। सॉफ्ट 44 Google की नजर में एक ऐसा पेज है जिसे 404 होना चाहिए था लेकिन वो
2:37
है नहीं। मतलब कि एक पेज कब नहीं होना चाहिए? अगर किसी पेज के अंदर वैल्यू नहीं है तो उस
2:44
पेज को नहीं होना चाहिए। करेक्ट? एक पेज है खाली है। आप ओपन करते हैं google.com
2:49
avab काबरा। पेज दिखाई दे रहा है लेकिन पेज के अंदर कुछ है नहीं। अब ऐसी सिचुएशन
2:55
में क्या करेंगे? ऐसी सिचुएशन में Google के हिसाब से उस पेज को नहीं होना चाहिए। अगर वो पेज नहीं होता तो Google बॉट को
3:00
उसे क्रॉल करने में एनर्जी ना खर्च करनी पड़ती। सो Google ऐसे पेजेस को सॉफ्ट 44
3:06
बोलता है और उन्हें इंडेक्स नहीं करता है। इंडेक्स करना भी नहीं चाहिए। सो ये सॉफ्ट 44 एक्चुअली में कैसे दिखाई देते हैं? मैं
3:12
आपको एक मैन्युफैक्चरर्ड पेज दिखाता हूं। जैसे हम आ गए इस टाइम्स ऑफ इंडिया के पेज के ऊपर। अब यहां पर आपको दिखाई दे रहा है
3:18
टाइम्स ऑफ इंडिया का ये पूरा यूआरएल है। ये एक उनका जो ऑथर बायो पेज होता है न्यूज़ डेस्क वाला ऑथर बायो पेज है। ये वो
3:24
पेज है। यहां पर हेडर दिखाई दे रहा है। फुटर दिखाई दे रहा है। लेकिन बीच में कुछ भी कंटेंट नहीं है। तो ये इस पेज के होने
3:29
का कोई मतलब नहीं है। नाउ एक्चुअली में टाइम्स ऑफ इंडिया का ऑथर डेस्क वाला पेज ऐसा नहीं दिखाई देता है। अगर कोई टाइम्स ऑफ इंडिया से है देख रहा है तो घबराने की
3:36
जरूरत नहीं। आपका पेज ठीक है। मैंने सिर्फ बीच का कंटेंट हटा दिया है एग्जांपल दिखाने के लिए। बहुत सारी वेबसाइट्स में
3:41
ऐसे पेज बन जाते हैं और खासतौर पर ये इशू तब भी होता है जब वेब डेवलपर्स एसइओ करने
3:48
की कोशिश करते हैं। कुछ वेबसाइट्स में ऐसा होता है कि जब आप किसी ऐसे यूआरएल को
3:53
विजिट करने की कोशिश करते हैं जहां पर 404 होना चाहिए। लेट से फॉर एग्जांपल जैसे मैंने अभी ओपन किया था यूआरएल google.com
4:02
का dabbra। नाउ ये पेज नहीं है। लेकिन कुछ वेबसाइट्स बड़ा इंटेलिजेंट सलूशन करती हैं। उनके डेवलपर क्या सोचते हैं कि हमें
4:08
404 पेज दिखाना है यहां पर। राइट? एक पेज जिसमें 404 लिखा हुआ है। ऐसा पेज नहीं
4:13
चाहिए। ऐसा पेज चाहिए जिसका स्टेटस कोड 404 हो। जैसे फॉर एग्जांपल यहां पर आ जाता हूं मैं और फिर से एक बार रन करता हूं।
4:20
इसे इस पेज को ओपन करता हूं। राइट? यहां पर आपको दिखाई देगा 404। ये आबरा का डाबरा 404 है। यहां स्टेटस कोड है। ये जो यहां
4:27
404 लिखा है ये एडिशनल डेकोरेशन है। करेक्ट? ये 404 एक्चुअली में पेज नहीं है।
4:34
लेकिन कुछ डेवलपर्स क्या करते हैं कि जब भी कोई यूजर किसी ऐसी वेबसाइट पर जाना चाहता है फॉर एग्जांपल लेट्स से abc.com
4:42
abra का डाबरा गिलीगली छू नहीं बोला जाएगा। abraरा का डाबरा यहां पर लिखा हुआ है। हम इस पेज को विजिट करने की कोशिश
4:49
करते हैं। तो वेबसाइट का जो डेवलपर है या कई बार एसयू ऐसी मिस्टेक करते हैं। वो क्या करते हैं? इसको रीडायरेक्ट करा देते
4:54
हैं और पेज आ जाता है 404 abc.com404। अभी जो 404 पेज इस तरह से बना दिया है
5:02
उसमें क्या होगा कि वो पेज ओपन होता है और इसी तरह का 404 वाला मैसेज दिखाई देता है। लेकिन वो पेज एक्चुअली में है। उसका
5:09
स्टेटस कोड 404 आता है। सो ऐसी सिचुएशन में इस तरह के पेजेस भी सॉफ्ट 44 माने
5:15
जाएंगे। बिकॉज़ पेज के अंदर कुछ नहीं लिखा है। येेंस यहां पर ये नहीं है कि इस पेज के अंदर 404 दिखाई दे रहा है। लिखा हुआ
5:22
है।ेंस ये है कि ये स्टेटस कोड 404 होना चाहिए। तो इस तरह की दो खास सिचुएशन की
5:27
वजह से सॉफ्ट 44 का इशू आ जाता है। और सॉफ्ट 44 के केस में क्या करना चाहिए?
5:33
आपको जाकर पेज को देखना है। जो भी Google ने सॉफ्ट 44 इशू वाले पेज आपको बताए हैं
5:39
उन पेजेस को जाकर विजिट करना है। ओके? एंड देन इसके बाद उन पेजेस का जो यूआरएल है,
5:45
उस यूआरएल को विजिट करें। देखें कि उसमें कंटेंट क्या ऐड कर सकते हैं। अगर कंटेंट
5:51
ऐड कर सकते हैं तो बहुत अच्छी बात है। आप कंटेंट ऐड करो। उसके बाद आपका जो पेज है वो इंडेक्स कर लेगा Google। अगर उस पेज पर
5:57
कंटेंट ऐड नहीं किया जा सकता है तो उस पेज को डिलीट कर लो। ओके? सॉफ्टवेयर फोर इग्नोर नहीं करने हैं। राइट? या तो आप उस
6:04
पेज पर कंटेंट ऐड करो या तो फिर उसे डिलीट कर दो। दो में से एक काम करो सॉफ्ट 4 का
6:09
इशू खत्म हो जाएगा। अगला इशू है डुप्लीकेट विदाउट यूजर सेलेक्टेड कैनोनिकल। यह सुनने
6:15
में बहुत लंबा है और यहां पर आपको एसइओ की पहली टफ कांसेप्ट को समझने का मौका मिलेगा
6:21
जो है कैनोनिकल। कैनोनिकल के ऊपर हमारा एक वीडियो है। लेकिन मैं कैनोनिकल को यहां
6:26
शुरुआत से एक्सप्लेन करता हूं। व्हाट इज कैनोनिकल? एग्जैक्टली लेट्स से कैनोनिकल कैनन से मिलताजुलता लगता है। लेकिन
6:32
एक्चुअली में इसका मीनिंग कैनन वाला नहीं होता है। कैनोनिकल का मतलब होता है प्रेफर्ड
6:39
या फेवरेट। हु इज़ योर कैनोनिकल एक्टर और
6:44
हु इज़ योर कैनोनिकल रीलमेकर। राइट? जिसको सबसे ज्यादा पसंद करते हो वो कैनोनिकल है,
6:49
प्रेफर्ड है। अब इसकी जरूरत Google को क्यों पड़ गई? वेल इसलिए पड़ गई क्योंकि जब भी वेबसाइट में किसी भी वेबसाइट में
6:56
पेज बनाए जाते हैं। कई बार ऐसा होता है बड़ी वेबसाइट है। उसमें बहुत सारे अलग-अलग
7:01
पेजेस हैं जिसमें सिमिलर कंटेंट है। लेट्स से कि हमारा एक पेज है। राइट? इस पेज का
7:06
नाम है पेज वन। इसमें टेक्स्ट लिखा हुआ है। दिस इज दी पेज वन। पेज वन इज वेरीेंट।
7:17
पेज फॉर माय वेबसाइट। ओके? इस पेज वन का एक यूआरएल भी बना देते हैं। नहीं तो बड़ा
7:22
अजीब सा लगेगा। abc.com पेज वन या पेज वन। ठीक है? ये मेरा यूआरएल
7:29
हो गया। और ये यूआरएल कैसा है? https ऐसे www
7:34
पूरी तरीके से बना देते हैं। राइट? एकदम परफेक्ट लगना चाहिए। सो ये मेरा पेज वन है जिसका यूआरएल है abc.com www.abc.com
7:42
पेज वन। इसके अंदर कंटेंट है। दिस इज़ पेज वन। पेज वन इज़ वेरीेंट। ठीक है? नाउ लेट्स से प्रोग्रामिंग की मिस्टेक की वजह से
7:49
आपकी वेबसाइट में एक और पेज बन जाता है। इस पेज का जो यूआरएल है वो है https
7:56
एंड देन abc.com पेज वन क्योंकि आपके डेवलपर एसइओ कर रहे थे। उन्होंने कहा है एबीसी हो या www हो या ना हो क्या ही फर्क
8:04
पड़ता है। दोनों में कंटेंट सेम हो गया। अब Google के लिए जैसा मैंने अभी थोड़ी देर पहले कहा था यूआरएल बहुत इंपॉर्टेंट
8:10
चीज होती है। ये यूआरएल अलग हैडब्ल्यू वाला और ये अलग है। इनफैक्ट अगर https
8:16
छोड़ के मैं http कर देता हूं जो कि बिल्कुल नहीं होना चाहिए तो भी ये दोनों पेजेस अलग हो जाते हैं। इनफैक्ट एक और
8:23
फर्क हो सकता है। यहां पर हो सकता है https है। राइट? भी है। ठीक है? लेकिन एक यूआरएल में आगे
8:30
स्लैश लगा हुआ है। फॉरवर्ड स्लैश एक में नहीं लगा हुआ है। फिर भी ये दोनों पेज अलग-अलग हैं Google के लिए। और ये दोनों
8:36
पेज Google एक साथ इंडेक्स कर सकता है। लेकिन Google पागल तो है नहीं। Google को पता है कि यार इन दोनों पेजेस में कंटेंट
8:42
तो हूबहू एग्जैक्टली सेम है। अगर दोनों में कंटेंट एग्जैक्टली सेम है तो मैं दो पेजेस को क्यों इंडेक्स करूंगा? Google
8:48
सिर्फ एक को इंडेक्स करेगा। राइट? अब जब Google के पास ये डिसीजन आ जाता है कि भाई
8:54
वो किसी भी एक पेज को इंडेक्स कर सकता है। हो सकता है आपकी वेबसाइट का जो पूरा इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर है राइट? जो सारे यूआरएल
9:00
हैं वो चल रहे हैं www पे। आपकी वेबसाइट बनी है www. इनफैक्ट Google भी https
9:06
www.g.com पर ओपन होता है। राइट? लेकिन Google का मन करता है भाई मैं इस बिनाडब्ल्यू वाले
9:13
वर्जन को इंडेक्स कर लूंगा। आपका लॉस हो जाएगा। अब आपके आधे यूआरएलw के साथ में
9:19
इंडेक्स हो रहे हैं। आधे बिना के। इसके अलावा ये तो हो गया एक टेक्निकल कैनोनिकल
9:24
है। ठीक है? ऐसी ही एक और सिचुएशन हो सकती है। वो दूसरी सिचुएशन क्या हो सकती है कि लेट्स से मेरा एक पेज जो है वो बहुत ही
9:30
सिंपल है पेज वन। दूसरा मेरा यूआरएल है पेज डैश वन। ओके? है यहां पे। वाला लफड़ा
9:37
नहीं है। ओके? और इस पेज में जो कंटेंट है वो कुछ ऐसा लिखा हुआ है। दिस पेज इज़ कॉल्ड
9:43
पेज वन हैज़ बीन दी मोस्टेंट पेज हियर ऑन दिस वेबसाइट। ओके। अब इन
9:53
दोनों पेजेस का यूआरएल अलग-अलग है। राइट? वाला कोई प्रॉब्लम नहीं है। लेकिन जो
9:58
कंटेंट है इन दोनों पेजेस का वो ऑलमोस्ट सिमिलर है। अब Google इन दोनों पेजेस को
10:04
तो इंडेक्स नहीं करेगा। क्योंकि इन दोनों का कंटेंट सिमिलर है। राइट? इन दोनों में
10:09
से किसी भी एक पेज को पिक कर सकता है। अगेन किस पेज को पिक करेगा? यह आप Google को नहीं बता सकते। कैसे बताओगे? इसमें
10:16
लिखोगे थोड़ी ना प्लीज इंडेक्स दिस। प्लीज इंडेक्स दैट। आपकी वेबसाइट है। साइट मैप लगा हुआ है। सारे यूआरएल ऑटोमेटिकली चले जाएंगे इंडेक्स होने के लिए। ये हो गया
10:23
दूसरा कैनोनिकल कंटेंट बेस्ड। तीसरा कैनोनिकल एक और हो सकता है जहां पर लेट्स
10:28
से कि आपकी वेबसाइट का यूआरएल है पेज वन। राइट? ये आपका कंटेंट था। और इसके बाद
10:35
यहां पर एक और दूसरा पेज बनता है जो है xyz.com।
10:40
राइट? यह xyz.com एक ऐसी वेबसाइट है जो आपका कंटेंट चुरा रही है। कॉपी करके पेस्ट
10:46
कर रही है अपनी वेबसाइट पे एज़ इट इज़। अब Google के पास दोनों ही पेजेस जो हैं वो
10:51
सेम कंटेंट लेकर जा रहे हैं। Google किसे इंडेक्स करें? टेक्निकली आप सोचोगे भाई अगर कोई मेरी कॉपी कर रहा है तो इसका मतलब
10:58
है कि मैंने पेज पहले पोस्ट किया है। मैंने पहले पब्लिश किया है। मैंने पहले बनाया है तो Google को मेरा कंटेंट इंडेक्स करना चाहिए। दैट इज़ ट्रू। करना
11:05
चाहिए। और Google करता भी है। लेकिन इस प्रोसेस में कुछ महीनों का टाइम लग जाता है Google को यह समझने में। इंटरनेट बहुत बड़ा है ये समझने में कि इस वेबसाइट में
11:12
एक कोई वेबसाइट है जो किसी खास दूसरी वेबसाइट के कंटेंट को चुरा रही है, कॉपी कर रही है। तो मुझे इसे इंडेक्स करके रैंक
11:17
नहीं करना चाहिए। इस प्रोसेस में टाइम लग सकता है। मे बी ना ही करे आपकी वेबसाइट बहुत छोटी है। तो यहां पर भी Google के
11:23
पास प्रॉब्लम आ जाती है। इन दोनों में से किस पेज को इंडेक्स किया जाए। इस प्रॉब्लम को सॉल्व करने के लिए Google ने बनाया
11:30
कैनोनिकल टैग। कैनोनिकल टैग टैग एक मेथड है जो हमें एक ऑप्शन देता है कि हम Google
11:37
को बता सकें कि भाई इन दोनों पेजेस में से इस वाले पेज को इंडेक्स करना है। राइट? ये
11:43
है वो पेज जिसे इंडेक्स करना है। इन दोनों पेजेस में से किसे इंडेक्स करना है? लेट्स से अगर मुझे बताना है कि ये वाला पेज
11:50
इंडेक्स करना है तो मैं बता सकता हूं कैनोनिकल टैग के जरिए। इन दोनों पेजेस में से ये मेरी वेबसाइट का पेज है। इसे
11:55
इंडेक्स करना है। मैं बता सकता हूं कैनोनिकल टैग लगाकर। ओके? अब क्रोनिकल टैग
12:01
पहले वाइल्ड में देख लेते हैं। लोग पूरी दुनिया में यूज़ कर भी रहे हैं, नहीं कर रहे हैं। हम ऐसे ही बनवा दें आपको। ठीक है? टाइम्स ऑफ इंडिया पेज देख लेते हैं।
12:07
वाइल्ड में देखते हैं। किसी भी वेबसाइट में जाओगे अगर वेबसाइट ढंग की बनी हुई है तो उसमें कैनोनिकल टैग जरूर होगा। इसका
12:13
सोर्स देख लेते हैं। आ गए। कमांड एफ कैनोनिकल। यह रहा कैनोनिकल
12:21
टैग। कैसा दिखाई दे रहा है? यह है। इस तरह का लिंक यहां पर लगाया जाता है। लिंक रेल
12:28
कैनोनिकल ओके। एक बार यहां पर मेरे को अलग से पेस्ट करके आपको दिखा देता हूं। पढ़ने में कैसा
12:35
आता है। राइट? थोड़ा सा इंट्रोडक्शन हो जाए। यह कोड पेस्ट किया गया है हेडर सेक्शन में। जो पेज का हेड होता है html
12:42
कंटेंट के अंदर जो पेज का हेड होता है वहां पर इस कैनोनिकल टैग को पेस्ट किया गया है। अब ये क्या बता रहा है? लिंक मतलब
12:49
ये एक लिंक देने वाला है ये html टैग। पूरा अगर किसी को एचटीएमl लैंग्वेज नहीं आती है। प्रोग्रामिंग लैंग्वेज नहीं कहा
12:55
जाता hटीml को। राइट? इट्स अ मार्कअप लैंग्वेज। बट अगर नहीं आती तो भी कोई दिक्कत नहीं। आप थोड़े बहुत कोड को ऐसे
13:01
कॉपी कर सकते हो। तो यहां पर लिंक रिलेशनशिप क्या है? इस लिंक के साथ में जिस पेज पर यह कोड डाला गया है उस पेज के
13:08
साथ में इस लिंक का रिलेशनशिप क्या है? कैनोनिकल। अब जो यूआरएल है पेज का वो क्या है? एक
13:15
बार फिर से आते हैं। पेज का यूआरएल क्या है? times of इंडिया.com कैनोनिकल क्या पड़ा हुआ है? times of
13:22
india times.com यानी कि यह अपने आप को ही कैनोनिकल बता रहा है। जब किसी पेज पर अपने
13:28
आप को ही कैनोनिकल बताया जाता है तो उसे बोलते हैं सेल्फ रेफरेंसिंग कैनोनिकल या
13:34
फिर अपने आप को दिया हुआ कैरेक्टर सर्टिफिकेट। ठीक है? तो अब हम यहां पर एक
13:39
काम करते हैं। इसे एक बार इसको कॉपी कर लेते हैं। एज़ इट इज़ कॉपी पेस्ट कर लेते हैं। यहां पर अगर हम आ जाएं इस पेज पर इन
13:45
दोनों पेजेस में क्या दिया जाएगा? कैनोनिकल टैग लगाया जाएगा। यह कैनोनिकल टैग कहां डाला जाएगा? इसे डाला जाएगा पेज
13:52
वन पर। क्योंकि हमें पेज वन पर बताना है कि भाई इस पेज का कैनोनिकल यही है। लेकिन
13:57
इस कंटेंट के लिए ऐसा ना हो कि कहीं Google https abc.com पर जाकर इंडेक्स कर ले। तो यहां पर भी हमें कैनोनिकल सेम ही
14:05
डालेंगे। कोड दोनों सेम रहेंगे। यहां पर ऐसा नहीं होगा कि ये abc.com है। तो मैंने www. हटा के abc फिर तो क्या होगा? फिर
14:12
दोनों पेजेस पर हम अलग-अलग कनोनिकल दे रहे हैं। जिन दो पेजेस पर कंटेंट सेम है, जिन
14:17
दो पेजेस पर कंटेंट सेम है, उन दोनों पर जिस पेज को इंडेक्स कराना है, उसी का लिंक
14:23
लगेगा। ये इंटरव्यू में क्वेश्चन पूछता हूं। तीन चार 5 साल पुराने एसइओस जो 5 साल एक्सपीरियंस एसइओस होते हैं वो भी फेल हो
14:29
जाते हैं। कहां पे कॉनकर लगाना है? नहीं होता आईडिया। कंफ्यूज हो जाते हैं। सिंपल है। जिन दो पेजेस पर कंटेंट सेम है, जिन
14:37
दो पेजेस का यूआरएल सिमिलर लग रहा है, उन दोनों पेजेस में जिस पेज को भी इंडेक्स कराना है, उसका यूआरएल कैनोनिकल में यूज़
14:44
किया जाएगा। जब उसी पेज पर डालेंगे, तो हो जाएगा सेल्फ रेफरेंसिंग और यहां पर डालेंगे तो प्लेन कैनोनिकल। लेकिन दोनों
14:51
मेंडब्ल्यूडब्ल्यू वाले वर्जन को ही यूज़ किया जा रहा है। तो इन दोनों पे यहां पे Google बट आएगा उसे पता लगेगा कि यार इस
14:58
पेज को इंडेक्स नहीं करना है। इसका फेवरेट कौन सा है? इसका फेवरेट है www वाला तो Google बॉट यहां पर आ जाएगा और इसको
15:04
इंडेक्स कर लेगा। अगर Google बॉट सीधे इसी पेज पर आता है तो यहां तो पता ही है कि मेरा फेवरेट मैं खुद हूं। मुझे इंडेक्स कर
15:09
लो। करेक्ट? यहां पर आ जाते हैं नीचे। यहां पर जहां पर दोनों में कंटेंट डिफरेंट है। अगर मैं चाहता हूं कि मुझे ये पेज
15:16
इंडेक्स कराना है तो मेरा जो कोड लगेगा वो लगेगा सेम। लेकिन इसमें पेज डैश वन है
15:22
इसका जो यूआरएल तो पेज डैश वन कर दूंगा मैं। करेक्ट? तो यहां पर ये सेल्फ रेफरेंसिंग कराल हो गया। अब पेज वन जो
15:29
दूसरा वाला पेज है उस पर भी आएंगे और उस पर भी मुझे कोड ऐड करना पड़ेगा। इस बार यहां पर पेज वन को नहीं लगाया जाएगा। पेज
15:36
डैश वन को लगाएंगे। सेल्फ रेफरेंसिंग कैनोनिकल यहां पर ये नहीं बनेगा। ये इस पेज को बता रहा है कि देखो इस पेज का
15:42
फेवरेट ये है। इस पेज का फेवरेट ये खुद ही है। तो Google किसे इंडेक्स करेगा? इसे।
15:47
अब आ जाते हैं यहां पर तीसरा एक यूआरएल और अब यहां पर ये लगता है कि भाई आप अपने पेज
15:52
में तो आ जाओगे। कैनोनिकल लगा दोगे। राइट? यहां पर है abc.com
15:58
पेज वन राइट लेकिन अब आप दूसरी वेबसाइट पर xyz.com पर जाकर कैनोनिकल नहीं लगा पाओगे।
16:04
कैसे लगाओगे? वो हमारी वेबसाइट है ही नहीं। तो यहां पर दो चीजें हैं। यहां पर
16:09
एक होप तो ये होती है। कई बार जो नकलची बंदर होते हैं जो दूसरों की वेबसाइट कंटेंट चोरी करते हैं। कई बार क्या होता है कि ये पूरी की पूरे कंटेंट को स्कैप
16:16
करते हैं स्क्रिप्ट से। तो जो स्क्रिप्ट स्कैप कर रही होती है वो कैनोनिकल वगैरह भी नहीं हटाती है। तो वो एज़ इट इज़ चला
16:22
जाता है। यहां पर ऑटोमेटिकली पेस्ट हो जाएगा। बट दिस इज ओनली योर होप। ऐसा हमेशा नहीं होता है। बहुत सारी सोफेस्टिकेटेड
16:28
स्क्रिप्ट्स होती हैं जो ऐसा नहीं भी करती हैं। वो अपने आप या abc.com को ना xyz.com
16:33
में कन्वर्ट कर लेंगी। तो जब भी ऐसा होगा आपको करना क्या होगा कि आपको अपना जो अपना
16:38
पेज है उस पे कंटेंट में कैनोनिकल डालते रहना है ताकि Google को यह पता लगे कि इस कंटेंट के लिए यही सबसे अच्छा पेज है। इसी
16:45
को मुझे बनाना है। राइट? अब इससे फायदा यह होगा कि Google धीरे-धीरे जब कैचअप करेगा तो आपकी वेबसाइट ऑटोमेटिकली खुद से रैंक
16:52
में आने लगी। Google आपके कॉपीकैट को हटा देगा। नाउ कैनोनिकल के बारे में दो-तीन
16:58
चीजें समझनी बहुत जरूरी है जो कॉमन नॉलेज नहीं है। कुछ लोगों को पता है, कुछ लोगों को नहीं पता है। नंबर एक कैनोनिकल हिंट
17:04
होता है इंस्ट्रक्शन नहीं। मतलब जब आप कैनोनिकल टैग लगाते हो तो Google या तो उस कैोनिकल टैग को मानेगा या नहीं मानेगा। ये
17:11
Google बॉट के ऊपर डिपेंड करता है। ओके? ये समझना जरूरी है। इसका मतलब ये नहीं कि
17:17
आप लगाओगे नहीं। लगाना तो पड़ेगा आपको। ओके? लगाना पड़ेगा। लेकिन कैनोनिकल टैग
17:25
अपने आप में हिंट होते हैं। इंस्ट्रक्शन ऐसा नहीं है कि अगर आप लगाओगे कैनोनिकल तो Google मानेगा ही मानेगा। ये फर्क समझ में
17:32
आना जरूरी है। दूसरी बात जब भी Google किसी भी एक पेज को कैनोनिकल बनाता है तो
17:38
दूसरे पेज की सारी लिंक्स वगैरह का बेनिफिट कैनोनिकल पेज को मिल जाता है। मतलब इसका क्या हुआ? ये बात बहुत समझनी
17:44
बहुत जरूरी है। लेट्स से कि आपका जो कंपैटर है जिसने आपकी कॉपीकैट बनाई हुई थी
17:49
बहुत सारी लिंक्स इसके पास एक लिंक नहीं है। एक लिंक है, दूसरी लिंक है, तीसरी
17:54
लिंक है। बैकलिंक बनी हुई है। इसके पास तीन बैकलिंक हैं। ओके? अब Google आपके इस पेज को कैनोनिकल बना देता है। तो इस पेज
18:01
पर जितनी भी लिंक्स हैं, बैकलिंक्स हैं, उन सबका जो पुण्य होगा, वह मिल जाएगा इसको। Google अपने आप ऑटोमेटिकली इस लिंक
18:09
के इस इस पेज की सारी बैकलिंक्स आपको ट्रांसफर कर देगा। तो उन सबका बेनिफिट आपको मिलने लगेगा। ये बात हमेशा याद रखनी
18:16
जरूरी है। ओके? इससे कंफ्यूजन होता है कई बार। सो कैनोनिकल क्या है? ये आपको समझ में आ गया कैसे काम करता है? ये समझ में आ
18:22
गया। अब हम आ जाते हैं इससे रिलेटेड Google सर्च कंसोल के एरर्स के ऊपर। अगर आपने कैनोनिकल समझ लिया है तो आगे तुरंत
18:29
ही समझ में आएगा। कैनोनिकल नहीं समझा है तो नहीं समझ में आएगा। ठीक है? तो यहां पर जो सबसे पहला इशू आपको दिखाई दे रहा है वो
18:35
है डुप्लीकेट विदाउट यूजर सेक्टेड कैनोनिकल। इसका मतलब Google के कहने का
18:40
मतलब सिर्फ इतना है कि आपका जो पेज है ना वो डुप्लीकेट है किसी और पेज का और आपने
18:46
कोई कैनोनिकल भी नहीं दे रखा है। मतलब अगर यहां पर हम इसी जगह पे आ जाते हैं। ये हमारे दो पेज हैं अलग-अलग तो ये इन दोनों
18:53
पेजेस पर कोई भी कैनोनिकल टैग नहीं है और इसमें डुप्लीकेट लगा हुआ है। तो अब क्या
18:58
हुआ कि आप चाहते थे इस पेज को इंडेक्स कराना Google ने उठा के इस पेज को इंडेक्स कर लिया है। राइट? और Google ने इस पेज को
19:05
इंडेक्स नहीं किया है। तो ये जिस पेज को इंडेक्स कर लिया वो तो इंडेक्सिंग वाली रिपोर्ट में चला गया कि ये यूआरएल इंडेक्स
19:11
है ग्रीन है। लेकिन जो यूआरएल इंडेक्स नहीं हुआ उसके लिए Google ने उसका यूआरएल उठाया और इस वाली लिस्ट में डाल दिया
19:19
जिसमें लिखा है डुप्लीकेट विदाउट यूजर सिलेक्टेड कैनोनिकल। तो अब इसे सॉल्व कैसे करेंगे? अगर आपको
19:26
कोई प्रॉब्लम नहीं है। Google ने इस वाले पेज को इंडेक्स कर लिया है। आपको लगता है यार ठीक है चलेगा। कोई दिक्कत नहीं है। तो
19:31
बना रहने दो कोई दिक्कत नहीं। इग्नोर मारो। लेकिन अगर इसे फिक्स करना है, सॉल्व करना है, तो फिर आपको अभी जैसा था
19:37
कैनोनिकल दोनों पेजेस पर लगाना पड़ेगा। राइट? दोनों पेजेस पर कैनोनिकल लगा देंगे।
19:43
प्रॉब्लम Google होपफुली सॉल्व कर लेगा। Google इस पेज को हटा देगा। इस पेज को इंडेक्स कर लेगा। ठीक है? ये हो गया पहला
19:51
इशू जो कैनोनिकल से रिलेटेड है। तो ये हमने फिक्स कर लिया। अब ऐसे ही यहां पर कुछ एक दो और इशूज़ हैं कैनोनिकल वाले।
19:57
उनको भी साथ में एक्सप्लेन कर देता हूं ताकि कंफ्यूजन कम हो। तो हम नीचे थोड़ा सा आ जाते हैं। ये है डुप्लीकेट Google चोज़
20:04
डिफरेंट कैनोनिकल देन यूजर। अब इसका क्या मतलब हुआ? ऊपर वाले का तो मतलब था कि भाई
20:09
Google को डुप्लीकेट पेज मिला है और यूजर ने यानी कि आप यूजर यानी कि यहां पर यूजर
20:15
का मतलब है आप वेबसाइट का जो एसइओ है वो उसने कोई भी कैनोनिकल नहीं डाला था। लेकिन
20:21
जब एरर दिखाई देता है आपको डुप्लीकेट Google चोज़ डिफरेंट कैनोनिकल देन यूजर।
20:26
इसका मतलब यह है कि आपने कैनोनिकल तो लगा रखा था लेकिन Google ने फिर भी इस पेज को
20:32
इंडेक्स कर लिया। आपने लगाया था कैनोनिकल लेकिन Google ने उसे फॉलो नहीं किया। अभी
20:38
मैंने थोड़ी देर पहले कहा था कि कैनोनिकल हिंट होता है। इंस्ट्रक्शन नहीं है। हिंट माना तो माना नहीं माना तो नहीं माना।
20:44
इंस्ट्रक्शन मानना ही पड़ता है। तो आपने लगा रखा था कैनोनिकल लेकिन फिर भी Google ने इस पेज को इंडेक्स कर लिया। अब इसे
20:51
कैसे सॉल्व करें? इसे सॉल्व करने का तरीका ये है कि इस अगर Google नहीं मान रहा है
20:56
आपके दिए हुए क्रोनिकल को तो इसका मतलब है आपकी वेबसाइट के स्ट्रक्चर में थोड़ा सा प्रॉब्लम है। हो सकता है आपने बहुत जगहों
21:02
पर इंटरनल लिंक बनाते वक्त इस वाले यूआरएल को यूज़ किया ये वाला विदाउट जोडw वाला
21:09
है। राइट? या फिर इस विदाउट वाले यूआरएल को ज्यादा इंटरनल लिंक मिली है। ज्यादा
21:14
एक्सटर्नल लिंक मिली हुई है। तो अगर आप चाहते हो कि Google इसी वाले को इंडेक्स करे। इसको 9 इंडेक्स करें तो हमें इस पेज
21:20
पर और इंटरनल लिंक बनानी पड़ेंगी www के साथ में। कहीं पर भी बिना www के अगर
21:26
इंटरनल लिंक है तो उसे हटाना पड़ेगा और अगर फिर भी Google सॉल्व नहीं करता है तो थोड़ी बहुत एक्सटर्नल बैकलिंक इस पेज को
21:31
दिलवा दो काम हो जाएगा। ठीक है? इतना ही करना है सिर्फ। अब आ जाते हैं एक और एरर के ऊपर जो है अल्टरनेट पेज विद प्रॉपर
21:38
कैनोनिकल टैग। इसका क्या मतलब हुआ? इसका मतलब यह हुआ कि दोनों पेजेस पर कैनोनिकल
21:46
लगा हुआ है। दोनों पेजेस पर कैनोनिकल टैग लगा हुआ है। कोई दिक्कत नहीं है। राइट? और
21:51
Google ने उसी पेज को इंडेक्स भी किया है जिसको इंडेक्स करना चाहिए था जिसको आप
21:56
चाहते थे। जिसको आपने कैनोनिकल बनाया था जिसको आपने फेवरेट बताया था। उसी पेज को Google ने इंडेक्स भी किया है। लेकिन फिर
22:04
इशू क्या है? अगर Google ने वही पेज इंडेक्स कर लिया जो आप चाहते थे तो फिर क्या है? वेल प्रॉब्लम सिर्फ इतनी है कि
22:10
आपका साइट मैप कहीं ना कहीं कहीं से Google को ये वाला यूआरएल देखने को मिल रहा है। तो ये पेज तो इंडेक्स हो चुका है।
22:17
अलग हो गया। दूसरा पेज अब आप देख रहे हो उस पेज का इंडेक्सिंग स्टेटस चेक कर रहे हो जिसको कभी इंडेक्स होना ही नहीं था।
22:22
आपने बोला ही नहीं था कि इसको इंडेक्स करना है। तो Google के कहने का मतलब ये है कि भाई मैंने वही किया जो तुमने बोला था।
22:27
आप मुझसे क्यों पूछ रहे हो कि ये पेज इंडेक्स क्यों नहीं है? है ना? तो अब इसको या तो इग्नोर कर दो बिकॉज़ ये प्रॉब्लम
22:33
नहीं है। अल्टरनेट पेज विद प्रॉपर कैनोनिकल टैग इज नॉट अ प्रॉब्लम। अगर फिर भी इसे हटाना है आपको ये ये एरर
22:41
नहीं अच्छी लग रही Google सर्च कंसोल में तो देखो कहीं ऐसा तो नहीं ये जो www के बिना वाला यूआरएल है ये वाला यूआरएल कहीं
22:47
साइट मैप में पड़ा हो कहीं इंटरनल लिंक में दिया हो इधर-उधर कहीं ना कहीं से हो रहा होगा अगर है तो हटा दो वरना इग्नोर
22:52
मारो अल्टरनेट पेज विद प्रॉपर कैनोनिकल टैग कोई इशू है ही नहीं ओके तो अब हमारी
22:58
कैनोनिकल वाली जितनी एरर्स थी वो सारी सॉर्ट आउट हो गई अब आ जाते हैं वापस फिर से ऊपर आ जाते हैं यहां पर 44 हो गया
23:05
सॉफ्ट 44 हो गया डुप्लीकेट विदाउट यूजर सिलेक्टेड कैनोनिकल हो गया। आ जाता है अगला इशू जो है पेज विद रीडायरेक्ट। पेज
23:11
विद रीडायरेक्ट का मतलब यह होता है यहां पे थोड़ा सा नीचे की तरफ आ जाते हैं। हम यहां पर एक पेज बनाते हैं। ये एक पेज है
23:18
मेरा पेज वन। ओके? जब इस पेज वन के जो
23:23
यूआरएल है, इस पेज वन का यूआरएल ले लेते हैं यहां पर। पाथ मैं डाल रहा हूं सिर्फ। ठीक है? जब हम डोमेन नेम नहीं यूज़ करते
23:28
हैं, तो उसे बोलते हैं पाथ। ठीक है? अब यह दूसरे पेज पर रीडायरेक्ट हो जाता है। यह
23:34
पेज है। पेज लेट्स से 11 यूआरएल हो गया इसका पेज
23:39
11 इस पर रीडायरेक्ट हो रहा है। Google बॉट मेरा जो भोला भाला मासूम सा Google बॉट है वो आता है
23:48
Google बॉट राइट वो आता है इस यूआरएल पर और उसे रीडायरेक्ट टरका दिया जाता है इस
23:54
यूआरएल पर। ओके? तो वो क्या करता है? इस पेज को इंडेक्स कर लेता है। मे बी करे मे
24:00
बी ना करें। दोनों में से कोई भी चीजें हो सकती हैं। इसको इंडेक्स कर लिया Google ने। लेकिन आप क्या कर रहे हो? आप इसका
24:06
स्टेटस चेक कर रहे हो। आप Google सर्च कंसोल में जो एरर देख रहे हो वो इस पेज के लिए दिखाई दे रही है। पेज विद रीडायरेक्ट
24:13
यानी कि इस पेज का इंडेक्सिंग स्टेटस क्यों चेक कर रहे हो? ये तो रीडायरेक्ट हो चुका है।
24:18
ओके? अब ये रीडायरेक्ट सही है या नहीं सही है? ये आपकी मर्जी है। है ना? ये आप समझ सकते हो। लेकिन आप एरर जो देख रहे हो
24:24
Google सर्च कंसोल में जिसका नाम है पेज विद रीडायरेक्ट वो एरर है इस पेज के लिए
24:29
ना कि इस पेज के लिए ये पेज तो इंडेक्स हो चुका है मे बी मे बी नहीं हुआ है लेकिन ये जो एरर है वो इस पेज का है। अब ये एरर
24:34
सॉल्व कैसे होगा आप इस रीडायरेक्ट को हटा दो जो भी कहीं से भी जहां से भी पेज विद
24:40
रीडायरेक्ट पेज वन को पेज 11 पर रीडायरेक्ट किया जा रहा है वो रूल हटा दो प्रॉब्लम सॉल्व हो जाएगा रीडायरेक्शन नहीं
24:46
करना है। अब ये रूल हटा दो जो मैं बोलता हूं या मैं बोलता हूं कैनोनिकल टैग यहां पे डालें। ये सारी चीजें अभी हो सकता है।
24:51
नहीं समझ में आया सॉल्व करके मतलब नोट बना के रखो। सेव करके रखो। याद करके रखो। अभी वर्डप्रेस की क्लास होगी वहां पर पता लग
24:56
जाएगा। नहीं तो अगर आप तुरंत ही जॉब करनी है जाके डेवलपर को बताओ अपने। राइट? जो भी डेवलपर है वर्डप्रेस हैंडल कर रहा है उसको
25:01
जाके बोलो कि देखो ऐसा होना था। मुझे कैनिकल टैग चाहिए। वो ढूंढ के लगा देगा। प्लगइिंस होते हैं अलग-अलग। राइट? उनसे
25:07
लगा देगा। बट मोटा-मोटी आपको समझ आ गया रीज़न क्या है। पेज विद रीडायरेक्ट के बाद आता है एक्सक्लूडेड बाय नो इंडेक्स टैग।
25:13
मतलब कि आपने पेज पर बोला हुआ है कि इस पेज को इंडेक्स नहीं करना है तो नहीं कर रहा है वो। एक टैग होता है मेटा टैग होता
25:20
है जिसे बोलते हैं नो इंडेक्स। यहां पर जैसे ये पेज है। ओके?
25:26
इस पेज पर नो इंडेक्स टैग लगा हुआ है। ठीक है? नो इंडेक्स। अभी मैं दिखा दूंगा ये
25:31
लगता कैसे है? दिखाई कैसे देता है? यह नो इंडेक्स टैग लगा हुआ है। यानी कि आप Google को बोल रहे हो कि इसे इंडेक्स नहीं
25:37
करना है तो Google उसे नहीं इंडेक्स कर रहा है। आपने जो बोला वही Google कर रहा है। अब यहां पर फिर भी क्वेश्चन आ जाता है
25:44
कि फिर ये एरर क्यों आ रही है? क्योंकि कहीं से कोई साइट मैप होगा जो Google को बता रहा होगा कि देखो इस पेज को इंडेक्स
25:49
कर लो। तो एक तरफ साइट मैप बोल रहा है कि इस पेज को इंडेक्स करो। आपने कोई इंटरनल लिंक दे रखी है। वो बोल रहा है इंडेक्स
25:55
करो। लेकिन पेज पर लगा हुआ है नो इंडेक्स। जैसे कैनोनिकल होता है हिंट। इंस्ट्रक्शन नहीं होता है। वैसे ही नो इंडेक्स
26:02
इंस्ट्रक्शन होता है। हिंट नहीं होता है। अगर आपने पेज में नो इंडेक्स लगाया है तो Google इंडेक्स नहीं करेगा। करेक्ट? अगर
26:09
नो इंडेक्स लगाया है तो इंडेक्स नहीं करेगा। ये सेट है। फिक्स है। इसमें कोई
26:14
चेंज नहीं हो सकता। तो अब आपको क्या करना होगा? पेज पर जाना होगा। नो इंडेक्स टैग
26:20
को हटा देना होगा। आपको पेज पर से नो इंडेक्स टैग हटाना है। प्रॉब्लम सॉल्व हो जाएगी। ठीक है? सिर्फ इतना करना होगा। यह
26:27
इशू भी अपने आप सॉर्ट आउट हो जाएगा। सो नो इंडेक्स नो इंडेक्स मैं बोलता जा रहा हूं। लेकिन आखिर नो इंडेक्स टैग कैसा दिखाई
26:32
देता है? एक बार आपको स्क्रीन पर दिखा देते हैं बना के ताकि अगर आपको कहीं रास्ते में मिल जाए तो आप उसे पहचान पाएं।
26:38
इस तरह से दिखाई देता है। मेटानेम रोबोट्स कंटेंट नो इंडेक्स। ओके? इसका मतलब है कि
26:44
पेज को इंडेक्स नहीं करना है। यह होता है इंस्ट्रक्शन। इसको Google को फॉलो करना ही
26:51
करना पड़ेगा। अगर किसी पेज में नो इंडेक्स लगा हुआ है तो वो इंडेक्स नहीं करेगा।
26:57
लेकिन इसका मतलब ये भी है कि Google को अगर कहीं से वो यूआरएल मिल जाता है इंटरनल लिंक में मिलता है साइट मैप में मिलता है
27:04
तो Google बॉट आपको ये वाली एरर देता है जिसमें बताता है कि भाई देखो मुझसे पूछ रहे हो कि ये यूआरएल इंडेक्स क्यों नहीं
27:09
किया है लेकिन इसका रीज़न ये है कि मैंने नो इंडेक्स टैग देखा है उस पेज पर तो इसीलिए मैं नहीं कर पा रहा हूं। तो अब
27:14
इसको हटाएंगे कैसे? इसको सॉल्व करने का तरीका है पेज से नो इंडेक्स हटा दो। प्रॉब्लम सॉल्व हो जाएगी। यहीं पर एक
27:20
मिलताजुलता पॉइंट भी है। कई बार जो है वह लोग अपनी वेबसाइट पर इस तरह का कोड भी लगाते हैं। मेटा नेम कंटेंट इंडेक्स एंड
27:27
साथ में इंडेक्स एंड फॉलो भी लगा देते हैं। राइट? अब इसका मीनिंग क्या होता है? इंडेक्स का मतलब है आप कह रहे हो कि
27:33
इंडेक्स कर लो। Google इंडेक्स वैसे भी कर लेता है। सो इसका यूज़ क्या है? कुछ नहीं।
27:41
करेक्ट? इसका यूज़ है कुछ नहीं। बिल्कुल भी। लेकिन साथ में जब इंडेक्स के साथ में फॉलो लगा होता है उसका यूज़ होता है। देखिए
27:49
इंडेक्स मतलब इस पेज को इंडेक्स कर लो। फॉलो मतलब इस पेज के अंदर मौजूद जितने भी
27:54
लिंक्स हैं उनको फॉलो करो। सो अगर यहां पर नो फॉलो लगा देते हैं। लेट्स से इंडेक्स
28:01
लिख दिया और नो फॉलो लिख दिया। इसका मतलब क्या हुआ? कि पेज को इंडेक्स कर लो। लेकिन
28:06
इसके अंदर जितनी भी लिंक्स हैं उनको फॉलो मत करना। यानी कि उनको विजिट मत करना। ये
28:12
अपने आप में Google मान सकता है या नहीं मान सकता ये उसके ऊपर डिपेंड करता है। तो ये इंडेक्स इंस्ट्रक्शन है। नो फॉलो या
28:18
फॉलो जो भी आप लिखते हो वो इंस्ट्रक्शन नहीं है। और वैसे भी किसी भी पेज पर लिंक्स को अगर आपको फॉलो नहीं कराना है तो
28:25
उसका तरीका इंडिविजुअल लिंक में नो फॉलो टैग लगाना होता है। हेडर में लगाना नहीं
28:31
होता। तो ये इंडेक्स फॉलो लिखना बेकार होता है। इसका कोई यूज़ इसका मतलब ये नहीं कि इस पेज का नुकसान हो रहा है। इसका मतलब
28:37
सिर्फ इतना है कि जो एसइओ है वो थोड़े से भोले हैं मासूम है। उन्हें ये नहीं पता कि इसकी जरूरत ही नहीं। जब भी आप किसी भी ऐसी
28:43
चीज को फॉलो करते हैं जिसका कोई लॉजिक नहीं होता है तो आप या तो सुपरस्टिशियस हैं या तो आपको पता नहीं था। बट कोई
28:48
नुकसान नहीं है इसमें। अगर कोई नुकसान वाली चीज होगी तो मैं आपको अलग से अलर्ट कर दूंगा। सावधान जागते रहो। खैर आ जाते
28:56
हैं हम अगले इशू के ऊपर जो है यहां पर सर्वर 500 दिखाई दे रहा है। अब देखो यहां
29:02
पर था यह फोर। यहां पर है ये फाइव। इसका मतलब क्या हुआ? जब भी कोई एरर कोई
29:08
एचटीटीपी स्टेटस कोड जो होता है वो फोर से चालू होता है। इसका मतलब है कि क्लाइंट की
29:13
तरफ से एरर है। देखो दो क्लाइंट हो दो चीजें होती हैं जब हम आते हैं ऑनलाइन वर्ड में। ये तो हो गया क्लाइंट। ठीक है? और ये
29:21
हो गया सर्वर। ठीक है? जब हम बोलते हैं क्लाइंट। क्लाइंट
29:26
का मतलब कौन है? क्लाइंट हैं आप। मुबारक हो। आप क्लाइंट हैं। आप क्लाइंट
29:34
हैं या फिर आपका ब्राउज़र क्लाइंट है। ठीक है? या तो आप क्लाइंट हैं या आपका
29:40
ब्राउज़र क्लाइंट है। मतलब अगर आपको वेबसाइट कोई विजिट करनी है तो आप ब्राउज़र पर ही तो टाइप करते हो। राइट? तो आप ही
29:46
हैं क्लाइंट। सर्वर कौन है? जहां पर वेबसाइट होस्ट कर रखी है। तो जब भी कोई 4
29:52
ओ एरर आती है यानी कि लेट्स से 401 एरर है या फिर 402 है या फिर 403 है या फिर 404
30:02
है। आपको 403 भी बहुत देखने को मिलेगी। राइट? ये सारी की सारी एरर आपके साइट से
30:08
हैं। अगर कोई पेज 44 है तो ये गलती आपकी है ना? आपने youtube.comरा
30:14
का डाबरा विजिट करने की कोशिश की। आपने google.com अमित तिवारी का वीडियो आपने यूआरएल ओपन करने की मिस्टेक करी। तो ये
30:21
प्रॉब्लम किसकी हुई? आपकी क्लाइंट की। इसीलिए फोर से हो शुरू होने वाली सारी एरर्स होती हैं क्लाइंट साइड एरर्स। सर्वर
30:28
से स्टार्ट सर्वर वाली जितनी भी एरर होती हैं वो होती हैं फाइव से शुरू होती हैं। राइट? यानी कि 5001 502 53। सबके डिटेल
30:37
मीनिंग समझने की जरूरत नहीं है। ठीक है? 4 5 समझ गए आप। सिमिलरली तीन से अगर कोई
30:43
शुरू होता है तो वो होता है रीडायरेक्शन। 301, 302, 307, 308 इनके बारे में हम लोग
30:48
रेस्पेक्टिव क्लासेस में पढ़ेंगे। एचटीटीपी स्टेटस कोड की भी एक क्लास होगी जहां पर ज्यादा दिमाग खाएंगे हम आपका। ठीक है? टू
30:54
से अगर चालू होता है तो इसका मतलब सब ओके है। ठीक है? सो यहां पर जो इशू है सर्वर एरर दिखाई दे। सर्वर एरर का मतलब है कि
31:00
होस्टिंग कंपनी जहां पर आपकी वेबसाइट होस्टेड है वहां पर एरर है। अगर किसी एक पेज पर जाना है लेट्स से यहां पर पेज है
31:08
हमारा अभी.com पेज वन और इसको विजिट करते टाइम सर्वर पे
31:15
एरर जो सर्वर एरर आती है वो 500 से चालू हो रही है। इसका मतलब है होस्टिंग कंपनी
31:21
डक कर रही है। होस्टिंग की तरफ से प्रॉब्लम है। आपकी प्रॉब्लम नहीं है। एसइओ की प्रॉब्लम नहीं है। होस्टिंग कंपनी की प्रॉब्लम है। होस्टिंग कंपनी से बात करो।
31:28
उनको बोलो भाई ये वाला पेज क्यों नहीं दिखाई दे रहा है? कोई टेक्निकल रीज़न हो सकता है। हो सकता है सर्वर उस टाइम डाउन था। हो सकता है सर्वर ठीक था लेकिन आपकी
31:35
वेबसाइट के कॉन्फ़िगरेशन में कोई प्रॉब्लम जिसकी वजह से सर्वर आपकी वेबसाइट की फाइल्स नहीं दे पा रहा है। जो भी हो
31:40
प्रॉब्लम होस्टिंग कंपनी से बात करके सॉर्ट हो जाएगी। तो अपने उन सारे यूआरएल्स को उठा लो जिस पर ये फाइव वाला एरर दिखाई
31:47
दे रहा है और आप आराम से उस प्रॉब्लम को सॉल्व करा सकते हैं। कुछ लोग सोच रहे होंगे कि मैं सारी बातें कर रहा हूं
31:54
Google सर्च कंसोल से रिलेटेड लेकिन Google सर्च कंसोल पे ही नहीं हूं। है ना? वो इसलिए नहीं हो क्योंकि यहां पर लिमिटेड
31:59
प्रॉब्लम दिखाई देंगी। आपको ज्यादा चुनौतियों के लिए तैयार करना है। अगर हम पेज इंडेक्सिंग रिपोर्ट पर जाएं वापस तो
32:04
यहां पर सब कुछ सेम है। ये एक-एक करके एरर दिखाई दे रहा है। आप इसके ऊपर क्लिक करोगे जब क्लिक करोगे तो यहां पर ग्राफ दिखाई
32:11
देगा। इसके नीचे यूआरएल दिखाई देगा। यहां पर कोई यूआरएल है नहीं ऐसा। इसे दिखाई नहीं दे रहा। यहां पर मैं क्लिक कर देता हूं। एक्सक्लूडेड बाय नो इंडेक्स टैग।
32:17
देखो नीचे आ रहा है ये। ठीक है? तो ये जो वेबसाइट है ये पेज है ये नो इंडेक्स। अब
32:22
अगर इसको अगर प्रूव करना हो अभी देखो यहां पर ये लिखा हुआ है एक्सक्लूडेड बाय नो इंडेक्स टैग। चलो एक बार देख लेते हैं। टेस्ट कर लेते हैं। इस यूआरएल को ओपन करते
32:28
हैं। mba.bl. ठीक है? यह पेज बना हुआ है। इसके ऊपर इंस्पेक्ट बटन के ऊपर क्लिक करते हैं। ना
32:36
इंस्पेक्ट के ऊपर क्लिक नहीं करेंगे। व्यू सोर्स के ऊपर क्लिक करेंगे। यहां पर आए सोर्स व्यू सोर्स करते हैं। राइट? यहां पर
32:42
देखते हैं नो इंडेक्स है या नहीं है। सो हम सर्च कर लेंगे। कमांड एफ नो इंडेक्स। ये देखो लगा हुआ है। मेटा नेम रोबोट्स
32:50
कंटेंट नो इंडेक्स। यही एक्सैक्टली बता रहा था अभी तक। मेटा नेम रोबोट्स कंटेंट इंडेक्स लगाए। नो इंडेक्स करना है तो इसको
32:56
नो इंडेक्स लिख दिया। तो सिंपल सी बात है। आप यहां पर इससे प्रैक्टिस कर लेंगे। आपको सामने सब कुछ सही-सही समझ में आ जाएगा।
33:03
Google सर्च कंसोल में बिल्कुल भी अजनबी सा नहीं लगेगा। ओके? सो वापस आ जाते हैं
33:09
जरा सा यहां पे। यहां पर कुछ चीजें आपको अलग से दिखाई दे रही है। सोर्स और वैलिडेशन और ये ट्रेंड ये अभी मैं समझा
33:14
देता हूं। पहले समझ लो कि एरर क्या है? डिटेल वहां पे समझ लेते हैं। फिर ये छोटी-मोटी चीजें तुरंत समझ में आ जाएंगी।
33:20
सो हम आ गए यहां पर। और अब इसके बाद आता है ब्लॉक्ड ड्यू टू अदर 400 इशज़। ये इशू
33:26
भी कम देखने को मिलता है लेकिन कभी कबभार मिलता है। देखो अभी थोड़ी देर पहले मैंने कहा कि जब भी फोर से कोई एरर शुरू हो रही
33:32
है इसका मतलब है क्लाइंट साइड प्रॉब्लम है। आपकी साइड से प्रॉब्लम है। जैसे अगर कभी 403 एरर आता है तो वहां पर दिखाई देगा
33:38
अन ऑथराइज़्ड एक्सेस। अनऑथराइज़्ड एक्सेस का क्या मतलब होता है? अनऑथराइज़्ड एक्सेस का मतलब सिर्फ इतना है कि आपको उस फोल्डर में
33:45
जाने की परमिशन है नहीं। आप जाने की कोशिश कर रहे हो। जब भी ऐसा होगा एरर आएगी 4 03
33:52
ठीक है तो सिंपल सी बात है आपने किसी ऐसे रिसोर्स को किसी ऐसे पेज को लिंक कर रखा है जो पब्लिक के लिए ओपन नहीं है उसे हटा
34:00
दो ठीक है तो ये प्रॉब्लम अपने आप सॉर्ट आउट हो जाएगी अब आ जाते हैं अगली प्रॉब्लम के ऊपर डिस्कवर्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स
34:06
क्रॉल्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स इसके अलावा और कोई इशू बचा नहीं बचा दो आ गई दो बड़ी प्रॉब्लम्स आ गई हैं डिस्कवर्ड करेंटली
34:14
नॉट इंडेक्स एंड क्रॉल्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स अब डिस्कवर का मीन मीनिंग क्या है? सबको पता है। करेक्ट। हमारे पास एक
34:20
वेबसाइट है। ये रही वेबसाइट का मेरा एक पेज। खूबसूरत सा पेज
34:27
है। abc.com पेज वन। ठीक है? इस वेबसाइट के पेज के
34:34
बारे में Google को पता है। भाई थोड़ा सा बड़ा हो जाओ।
34:39
आगे मेरा पेज है। ब्लू कलर का पेज है। अब एक जो Google बॉट है हमारा उस Google बॉट
34:45
को इसके बारे में पता है। ठीक है? Google बॉट को पता कैसे है? बिकॉज़ हमने साइट मैप
34:51
में इस यूआरएल को डाला हुआ था। राइट? साइट मैप में डाला था या इंटरनल लिंक था? कुछ भी था। abc.com पेज वन के बारे में Google
34:59
बॉट को पता है। राइट? इट हैज़ डिस्कवर्ड इट। पता लग गया है। इंफॉर्मेशन है। लेकिन
35:07
करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स्ड। मतलब पता तो है Google बॉट को लेकिन उसने इंडेक्स नहीं
35:14
किया है। दूसरी एरर साथ में जुड़वा सी लगती है लेकिन है नहीं। दूसरी है क्रॉल्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स। इसका मतलब क्या है?
35:20
इसका मतलब यह है कि Google बट इस पेज पर गया तो है विजिट कर लिया है इसने। ठीक है?
35:29
लेकिन इंडेक्स नहीं किया। अगर क्रॉल्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स का मतलब यह है कि Google बॉट ने वेबसाइट को क्रॉल किया है
35:35
लेकिन इंडेक्स नहीं किया है तो डिस्कवर्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स का मतलब क्या होता है कि जब Google बॉट को पता तो लग गया यूआरएल
35:43
के बारे में लेकिन यूआरएल को अभी तक क्रॉल ही नहीं किया है। तो इन दोनों एरर्स के बीच में डिफरेंस क्या हुआ? इंडेक्स तो
35:49
दोनों में नहीं हुआ। इसका मतलब यह है डिस्कवर्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स का कि Google बॉट को पता है लेकिन Google बॉट ने
35:55
पेज को विजिट नहीं किया। और क्रॉल्ड का मतलब यह है कि क्रॉल कर लिया लेकिन फिर
36:01
इंडेक्स नहीं किया। तो अगर आप किसी इंसान से मिले नहीं Google बॉट ने हमारा पेज
36:06
देखा नहीं और फिर भी नहीं इंडेक्स किया इसका मतलब क्या हुआ? उसको यह भरोसा है कि पेज अच्छा ही नहीं होने वाला। Google बॉट
36:12
को सम हाउ किसी भी रीज़न से लगता है कि इस पेज का कंटेंट अच्छा नहीं होगा तो मैं
36:17
क्यों विजिट करूं? अपने रिसोर्सेज को क्यों खर्च करूं? तो मैं नहीं जा रहा। मैं
36:23
नहीं विजिट करूंगा। मैं नहीं इंडेक्स करूंगा। यह बड़ा सीवियर रीजन है। इससे एक छोटा रीजन भी हो सकता है। हम लोगों ने बात
36:29
की थी Google सर्च Google सर्च वाली क्लास में जहां पर मैंने बताया था कि एक रिपॉजिटरी वाला सेक्शन हो। ये देख रहे हैं
36:35
यहां पर हमें पता था कि एक यूआरएल सर्वर नाम का एक सिस्टम होता है जो क्रॉलर को यूआरएल बैच में देता है। है ना? कभी ऐसा
36:43
नहीं कि एक साथ जो भी यूआरएल आए तुरंत क्रॉल करेगा। Google बट को बैच में मिलता है। हो सकता है यूआरएल सर्वर के पास थोड़ा
36:49
ट्रैफिक ज्यादा हो। भीड़ लगी हो। बहुत सारे यूआरएल बल्क में बहुत सारे लोगों ने सबमिट रिक्वेस्ट कर रखी है। तो ऐसे में
36:56
क्या होगा कि यूआरएल सर्वर आपके जो Google बट है उसको आपका यूआरएल अभी तक नहीं दे
37:02
पाया है। तो थोड़ा सा टाइम लग रहा है। डिस्कवर कर लिया। पता लग गया अभी आपका यूआरएल कतार में है। आप कतार में है। आप
37:09
वेट कर रहे हैं। आपका यूआरएल वेट कर रहा है। थोड़ा दिन वेट कर लो प्रॉब्लम सॉल्व हो जाएगी। ठीक है? अगर ये नहीं है तो फिर
37:16
दूसरी प्रॉब्लम सीरियस है। यानी कि वेबसाइट का कंटेंट जो है ना वो Google बॉट को ठीक नहीं लग रहा है।
37:22
उसको अच्छा क्योंकि पेज को विजिट नहीं किया तो फिर ऐसा क्यों लग रहा है Google बट को कि आपके उस पेज का कंटेंट अच्छा
37:29
नहीं हो सकता है क्योंकि आपकी वेबसाइट का कंटेंट अच्छा नहीं है। तो जब आपकी वेबसाइट के बहुत सारे पेज ऐसा नहीं कि दो चार
37:34
पेजेस डिस्कवर्ड करंटली नॉट इंडेक्स में तो भी नहीं जाएंगे। वहां पर हो सकता है कि यूआरएल का पैटर्न है वो अच्छा नहीं। मे बी
37:39
लेट्स से कि किसी एक यूआरएल का जो पैटर्न है abc.com पेज वन नहीं है। एंड लेट्स से कि अगर इसका यूआरएल जो है वो 4ओ4 है तो
37:48
यहां पे हो सकता है Google बॉट ये सोचे कि भाई यूआरएल ही 4ओ4 है तो मैं क्यों जाके विजिट करूं? इसमें कंटेंट अच्छा है। 44 को
37:54
क्यों इंडेक्स करूंगा? या मे बी ऐसा भी हो सकता है कि ये जो यूआरएल है ये यूआरएल है
38:00
लेट्स से लोरेप्स। Google नहीं विजिट करेगा। उसको नहीं भरोसा कि इस पेज पर कुछ भी अच्छा कंटेंट हो सकता है। या फिर यहां
38:05
पर लिखा हुआ है डमी कंटेंट। कुछ भी ऐसा हो जिससे Google को यह लगे कि यार ये यूआरएल
38:10
अच्छा नहीं हो सकता है तो यहां पर हम क्या करें? नहीं विजिट करने वाले इस पेज को छोड़ देते हैं। ठीक है? या फिर दूसरा इशू
38:17
है कि आपकी वेबसाइट का ओवरऑल क्वालिटी खराब है। अगर बहुत सारे पेजेस में ऐसी प्रॉब्लम है डिस्कवर्ड करेंटली नॉट
38:23
इंडेक्स का नंबर बहुत ज्यादा है। इसका मतलब है Google बॉट को आपकी वेबसाइट का जो कंटेंट है ओवरऑल वेबसाइट का कंटेंट वो ठीक
38:29
नहीं लग रहा है और अगर कुछ दिन वेट करने के बाद एक हफ्ते वेट करने के बाद भी आपकी वो पेज इंडेक्स नहीं हो रहा है। इसका मतलब
38:35
है कि आपको अपनी वेबसाइट के पूरे कंटेंट को विजिट करने की जरूरत है। इंट्रोस्पेक्शन की जरूरत है कि भाई मैं
38:40
ऐसा कंटेंट क्यों बना रहा हूं जिसको Google बॉट क्रॉल ही नहीं कर पा रहा है। इंडेक्स ही नहीं करने को राजी है। ठीक है?
38:46
अब दूसरी एरर के ऊपर आ जाते हैं जो है क्रॉल्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स। ठीक है? अब ये जो कुछ यहां पर ये कुछ आइडियाज लिखे
38:53
हैं जिससे आप ठीक कर सकते हैं। इसके बारे में आ जाते हैं। पहले क्रॉल्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स को समझाना जरूरी है। क्रॉल्ड
38:58
करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स में थोड़ी सी प्रॉब्लम कम हो जाती है। लोग अधिकतर क्रॉल्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स को ज्यादा बड़ी प्रॉब्लम मानते हैं। लेकिन मेरे
39:04
हिसाब से डिस्कवर्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स ज्यादा बड़ी प्रॉब्लम है। तो क्रॉल्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स प्रॉब्लम का मतलब है
39:09
कि Google बॉट को आपके यूआरएल के बारे में पता लगा। एंड देन Google बॉट ने आपकी वेबसाइट को विजिट किया एंड देन सोचा कि
39:15
अरे भाई इसे नहीं इंडेक्स करना। इसका मतलब है अगेन पहला यह हो सकता है कि सिर्फ अभी इंडेक्सर बिजी है लेकिन वो छोटी कभी कबभार
39:22
ऐसा होता है। बड़ी प्रॉब्लम ये है कि आपकी वेबसाइट का आपकी वेबसाइट का आपके उस पेज का abc.com पेज वन का इसका कंटेंट Google
39:31
को अच्छा नहीं लगा है। ठीक है? इसका कंटेंट ठीक नहीं लगा। तो आपको क्या करना है? सिर्फ और सिर्फ उस पेज का कंटेंट
39:38
इंप्रूव करना है। अगर कंटेंट ऑलरेडी अच्छा है तो थोड़े बहुत एग्जांपल्स डालने हैं। इंफोग्राफिक डाल सकते हो आप। है ना? कुछ
39:44
एक्सटर्नल लिंक डाल सकते हो प्रूफ करने के लिए कि आपने वेबसाइट पे जो भी कंटेंट लिखा है वो सही लिखा हुआ है। ठीक है? यहां तक
39:51
समझ में आ गया? नाउ जब हम डिस्कवर्ड करें नॉट इंडेक्स और क्रॉल करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स दोनों को जब हम सॉल्व करने की कोशिश करते
39:57
हैं तो हम कुछ ट्रिक्स भी यूज़ कर सकते हैं। बिकॉज़ एसइओ इज़ नॉट जस्ट अबाउट Google ने जो बोला है एग्जैक्टली वही करते
40:03
रहो। मैं आपको सर्जेंट बना रहा हूं। आपको सारी पता करनी है कि कौन सी मसल कहां से जाती है, कौन सी नस कहां से जाती है, कौन
40:09
सी हड्डी कहां से बेंड होती है, ताकि आप कायदे से तोड़ सको। अच्छा एसइओ वही है जो रूल्स को इतने अच्छे तरीके से जानता हो कि
40:15
फिर इसके बाद अपने फायदे के लिए उन्हें बेंड कर सके, तोड़ सके। ओके?
40:21
नाउ देखते हैं यहां पर। डिस्कवर्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स के केस में आप एक तो 7 से 10 दिन का वेट करो। जैसे मैंने बोला था अगर
40:28
जो Google बॉट है वो बिजी होगा, यूआरएल सर्वर बिजी होगा तो वो थोड़े दिनों में क्लियर हो जाएगी। क्यों? और अपने आप विजिट करने लगेगा। दूसरा तरीका है यूआरएल चेंज
40:35
कर दो। अगर आपका यूआरएल था स्लश पेज वन कई बार ऐसा होता है पेज वन Google ने मान के
40:40
रख लिया है कि भाई यह यूआरएल खराब है तो पेज डैश वन कर देते हैं या कुछ पेज डैश वन एग्जांपल ऐसा नहीं कि अपने यूआरएल में जाओ
40:46
डैश ऐड कर दो। अपने यूआरएल को थोड़ा सा पेज के कंटेंट से मैचिंग करो। Google बॉट
40:52
को थोड़ा सा हिंट मिलना चाहिए कि भाई पेज के अंदर क्या हो सकता है। एंड देन इसके बाद वो इंडेक्स कर लेगा। अगर अभी तक आपका
40:58
जो यूआरएल था वो ऐसा था कि लेट्स से abc.com
41:05
बेस्ट डेंटिस्ट इन दिल्ली। अब ये बड़ा ही जेरिक सा यूआरएल
41:10
है। राइट? बहुत सारे लोग अपने आप को बेस्ट डेंटिस्ट बोलते हैं। होते तो नहीं है ना? ठीक है? तो यहां पर आ जाते हैं। हमने
41:16
दूसरा यूआरएल बना दिया। abc.com एक्स अवार्ड विनर
41:26
डेंटिस्ट इन दिल्ली। अब यह अवार्ड का नाम एक्स जो भी हो। राइट? यह अवार्ड विनर आपने
41:32
बोल दिया। तो अब आप प्रूव कर रहे हो कि हां यह जो डेंटिस्ट है ये अवार्ड विनिंग है, ट्रस्टेड है। इसको आके देखो। तो इस
41:40
तरह से हम थोड़ा सा यूआरएल को ट्वीट करके चेंज करके Google को बुलाते हैं। टाइटल डिस्क्रिप्शन चेंज कर सकते हैं। जिससे
41:45
Google को थोड़ा सा पेज के कंटेंट के बारे में ज्यादा हिंट मिल जाती है। एंड देन इसके बाद अगर इन तीनों चीजों के बाद भी
41:51
इंडेक्स नहीं होता तो आपको अपनी वेबसाइट के कंटेंट को इंप्रूव करने की जरूरत है। क्रॉल्ड करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स के केस में
41:57
आपको एक तो यूआरएल चेंज करके काम चला सकते हो। लेकिन सबसे पहले वेट कर लेना जरूरी है। वेट कर लो। इसके बाद आपको टाइटल
42:04
डिस्क्रिप्शन चेंज कर सकते हो। यूआरएल चेंज कर सकते हो। इंटरनल लिंक जो उस पेज को मिल रही है उसका नंबर चेंज कर सकते हो।
42:10
यानी कि लेट्स से ये हमारा abc.com पेज वन है। अभी तक इसको सिर्फ एक ही इंटरनल लिंक
42:16
मिला हुआ था। होम पेज से या कहीं से भी एक ही इंटरनल लिंक मिला हुआ था। तो अब काम
42:21
करते हैं थोड़ी सी ज्यादा बढ़ा देते हैं। एक ये है एक और है। कोई कांटेक्ट अस पेज से लेके आ जाओ। किसी कैटेगरी पेज से बना
42:27
दो। किसी ब्लॉग पेज से बना दो। इंटरनल लिंक बढ़ेंगी। Google को लगेगा ये पेज इंपॉर्टेंट है। एंड उसे इंडेक्स कर लेगा।
42:34
अगर इससे भी काम नहीं चलती है तो कुछ बैकलिंक्स बना दो जो दूसरी वेबसाइट और बनती है जिसके बारे में आगे आने वाली क्लास के ऊपर बात करेंगे और साथ ही में
42:41
पेज का कंटेंट भी ऑप्टिमाइज कर दें आप ये प्रॉब्लम जड़ से चली जाएगी
42:47
तो इसके साथ आप Google सर्च कंसोल में किसी भी वेबसाइट के जो यूआरएल होते हैं
42:52
उनको सॉल्व करने जो उनकी प्रॉब्लम्स होती है मेजर प्रॉब्लम्स आपने सुन ली और उनके सॉल्यूशन भी आपने देख लिए। अब जब आप इन
42:59
सॉलशंस को एक-एक करके इंप्लीमेंट करना शुरू करेंगे तो आपकी वेबसाइट के यूआरएल इंडेक्स होने लगेंगे जो यूआरएल इंडेक्स
43:05
नहीं थे। एक बात हमेशा याद रखनी है कि किसी वेबसाइट के सारे यूआरएल इंडेक्स करने लायक नहीं होते हैं। इस क्लास के ही कुछ
43:13
स्टूडेंट्स अच्छी जॉब ले लेंगे। कुछ स्टूडेंट्स एजेंसी बना लेंगे। लेकिन कुछ स्टूडेंट्स दूसरे ट्यूटोरियल ढूंढते रह
43:18
जाएंगे। यह होने वाला है। बिकॉज़ यह डिपेंड करता है आउटकम कि आप कितनी मेहनत करने वाले हैं। वैसे ही हर वेबसाइट का हर पेज
43:25
इक्वली डिर्व नहीं करता है इंडेक्स होना। जैसे कुछ लोग परेशान हो जाते हैं टर्म्स एंड कंडीशन प्राइवेसी पॉलिसी वो वाला पेज
43:31
मेरा इंडेक्स नहीं हो रहा। अरे क्यों इंडेक्स होगा? प्राइवेसी पॉलिसी टर्म्स एंड कंडीशन ये पेजेस सारे इंडेक्स कराने के थोड़ी ना होते हैं। इन पे तो नो
43:37
इंडेक्स डाल दोगे तो भी चलेगा। राइट? हम इन्हें हम इन पे नो इंडेक्स डालने के लिए इसे सजेशन नहीं देते क्योंकि एक दो पेजेस
43:43
हैं। इससे आपका कोई क्रॉल बजट नहीं चला जाएगा। क्रॉल बजट के बारे में आगे बात होगी। लेकिन इनको इंडेक्स होने की जरूरत
43:48
नहीं है। कुछ पेजेस नहीं इंडेक्स होने चाहिए। वो ठीक है। अगर आपका कोई इंटरनल पेज था वो नहीं इंडेक्स होगा। अगर कोई फीड
43:54
पेज है तो वो इंडेक्स नहीं होगा। अगर लॉग इन साइन अप वाला पेज है नहीं इंडेक्स हो रहा कोई बात नहीं। ठीक है चलेगा। टेंशन
43:59
नहीं लेनी है। लेकिन जो पेजेस इंडेक्स होने चाहिए उनको इंडेक्स करने के लिए आपको अलग-अलग प्रॉब्लम्स को देखना चाहिए एंड
44:05
इसके बाद करना चाहिए। नाउ यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं इस टेबल में रीज़न था। रीज़न आपने
44:12
समझ लिए। फिर आ जाता है सोर्स। सोर्स यह Google के बताने का तरीका है कि देखो कहां से प्रॉब्लम आ रही है। जैसे क्रॉल्ड
44:17
करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स। यह Google सिस्टम की प्रॉब्लम है। भाई Google सिस्टम ने विजिट कर लिया, क्रॉल कर लिया। अब नहीं इंडेक्स
44:23
कर रहा तो इसका प्रॉब्लम का सोर्स कौन हुआ? Google सिस्टम। लेकिन अगर पेज यूआरएल ठीक नहीं है, फोर फोर एरर आ रहा है तो फिर
44:30
इसका मतलब है कि आप उसे सॉल्व करेंगे आप। तो, यहां पे सिर्फ एक बहुत ही छोटा सा वो
44:35
हिंट दे रहा है। अब ये आपके लिए अब बड़ी बात नहीं है। अब आप इसके ऊपर फोकस नहीं करेंगे। बिकॉज़ आपको ये प्रॉब्लम अच्छे से
44:40
पता है। जिन लोगों को ज्यादा एसइओ नहीं आता है उनके लिए Google ने दे रखा है। नाउ इसके बाद आता है वैलिडेशन। वैलिडेशन क्या
44:45
चीज़ होती है? देखिए मैं बार-बार बता रहा हूं कि ये प्रॉब्लम है। इसका ये सॉल्यूशन है। अब मान लो आपने प्रॉब्लम का सशन कर
44:51
दिया। आपके पास सॉफ्ट 44 वाले कुछ यूआरएल थे। आपने उन पेजेस पर जाकर कंटेंट ऐड कर दिया। अब Google को कैसे बताएं कि भाई
44:57
हमने कंटेंट इंप्रूव कर दिया है। तरीका यहां पर ये है। आप उसी एरर जिस एरर को आपने फिक्स किया है उसी एरर के सामने
45:03
क्लिक करो। ठीक है? क्लिक होने के बाद यहां पर यह वाला बटन आता है वैलिडेट फिक्स। इस पर
45:10
क्लिक करना है। और यह फिक्स करने के बाद जब आप बोल बटन दबा देते हैं वैलिडेट फिक्स तो फिर Google बॉट Google को सिस्टम को
45:17
पता लग जाता है कि भाई ये वाली प्रॉब्लम इस वेबसाइट पे ठीक हो गई है। अब वो आकर वापस देखेगा। अब यहां पर मान लो छह यूआरएल
45:24
हैं। तो इन छह यूआरएल में सभी को नहीं देखेगा। कुछ को देखेगा। ठीक है? पहला वाला
45:29
देखा। अगर फोर फोर हट चुका है। प्रॉब्लम सॉल्व हो चुकी है। फिर दूसरे को देख तीसरे को देखेगा। ऐसे ही सैंपल यूआरएल देखेगा।
45:35
उसके बाद ये प्रॉब्लम फिक्स हो जाएगी। यहां पर वो यूआरएल हट जाएंगे। इस प्रॉब्लम को हटा दिया जाएगा। लेकिन अगर आप
45:41
एक्साइटेड एसइओस में से हैं कि जैसे ही प्रॉब्लम देखी यहां पर आकर तुरंत ही जो है वैलिडेट फिक्स बटन के ऊपर क्लिक कर दिया।
45:47
इसके बाद हम सॉल्व करेंगे ये फिर यहां पे फेल कर देगा और आपकी वेबसाइट की रेपुटेशन डाउन जाएगी। नेक्स्ट टाइम जब आप वैलिडेट
45:52
फिक्स बटन पे क्लिक करते हैं उसके एक्ट करने के Google सिस्टम के एक्ट करने की जो पॉसिबिलिटी चांसेस है वो और कम हो जाते
45:58
हैं। क्योंकि आप Google को गलत इनफार्मेशन फीड कर रहे हो भाई। सही इनफेशन फीड करना आपकी रिस्पांसिबिलिटी बनती है। आपको तभी
46:04
वैलिडेट फिक्स बटन को क्लिक करना है जब वह प्रॉब्लम एक्चुअली में सॉल्व हो गई है। आपने मेहनत कर ली है। अगर उसके बिना
46:11
करेंगे तो Google वैलिडेट फिक्स नहीं अप्रूव करेगा। कुछ फायदा नहीं होगा। ठीक है? नाउ इसके बाद यहां पर ट्रेंड दिखाई दे
46:18
रहा है। ट्रेंड बेसिकली हमें बताता है। एकदम क्विकली बता देता है कि किसी वेबसाइट में ये बढ़ रहे हैं या घट रहे हैं। जैसे
46:24
यहां पर देख के बता सकता हूं कि क्रॉड करें नॉट इंडेक्स पहले कम हुआ करते थे। अभी बढ़ रहे हैं। ठीक है? पेजेस नंबर
46:30
बताता है कि ये इशू कितने पेजेस में है यहां पर। ये आपको पेजेस के इस नंबर से पता लग जाता है। नाउ इससे पहले मैं इंडेक्सिंग
46:36
पेजेस से बाहर आऊं। आपको एक चीज और दिखा देता हूं। ये यहां पर दिखाई दे रहा है व्यू डेटा अबाउट क्रॉल पेजेस। इसके ऊपर
46:41
क्लिक कर लेते हैं। यहां पर आपको उन सारे यूआरएल्स का नंबर मिल जाएगा जिन्हें Google ने इंडेक्स कर रखा है। ये एक डमी
46:47
वेबसाइट है। तो यहां पर ये नंबर ज़ीरो दिखाई दे रहा है। बट मैं एक बार निधा स्ट्रीट को ओपन कर लेता हूं। यहां पर हम
46:52
देख सकते हैं कि अगर हम क्लिक करें इंडेक्स पेजेस के बारे में तो यहां पर इंडेक्स पेजेस का नंबर दिखाई दे जाएगा। और
46:57
यह भी पता लग जाएगा कि लास्ट टाइम कब क्रॉल किया गया था। ओके यहां से पता लग जाता है बहुत ही ईजी अच्छी सी आराम सेदायक
47:05
चीज़ है। ओके नाउ यहां पर अगर आप चाहें तो एक्सपोर्ट कर सकते हैं। लेकिन जहां पर भी Google ने एक्सपोर्ट का ऑप्शन दिया हुआ है
47:11
Google सर्च कंसोल में उसमें लिमिट है। लिमिट है 1000 यूआरएल की। Google सिर्फ 1000 यूआरएल देगा। अगर यहां पर आपकी
47:18
वेबसाइट में 1 मिलियन पेजेस हैं। उसमें से 2 लाख पेजेस ऐसे हैं जिनमें क्रॉल्ड
47:24
करेंटली नॉट इंडेक्स का इशू आ रहा है। तो Google आपको 2 लाख यूआरएल नहीं देगा कि आप एक-एक यूआरएल को जाकर चेक करो, सही करो।
47:32
1000 यूआरएल ही मिलेंगे। एपीआई को यूज़ करते हो तो 2000 यूआरएल मिल जाएंगे। अदरवाइज 1000 यूआरएल ही मिलेंगे। यहां
47:38
डैशबोर्ड से अगर क्लिक करते हो। अब कई बार एसइओस पूछते हैं कि भाई अगर मेरे पास 2 लाख यूआरएल है जिनमें एक प्रॉब्लम है। और
47:45
Google मेरे को 1000 ही यूआरएल देगा तो मैं फिक्स कैसे करूंगा? यह आपका सर दर्द है। Google हमें गाइड कर सकता है कि
47:51
Google ने गोद नहीं लिया हुआ है। आपको जाकर देखना पड़ेगा कि भाई मेरी वेबसाइट में ये ओवरऑल प्रॉब्लम क्यों आ रही है।
47:56
वेबसाइट तो रिस्पोंसिबिलिटी है आपकी ना। पैसे तो आप उससे बना रहे हो। तो आप जाकर देखो अच्छी एजेंसी हायर करो। अच्छा एसइओ
48:02
हायर करो या अपने आप को अपस्किल करो। अपना एक्सपीरियंस बढ़ाओ और खुद से वेबसाइट को देखकर फाइंड आउट करो कि आपकी वेबसाइट में
48:07
ये क्रॉल करें नॉट इंडेक्स इशू यानी कि 2 लाख पेजेस में जो कंटेंट अच्छा नहीं है उसको मैं कैसे इंप्रूव करूं। यह आपकी सर
48:14
दर्द होगा। आपका हेडेक है Google का नहीं है। Google आपको सिर्फ सैंपल में 1000 यूआरएल ही देगा। मैंने कहा था ना लो
48:21
प्रायोरिटी लो परफॉर्मेंस सिस्टम है ये। ये बात जो पहले क्लास में कहीं भी किसी भी ड्यूरेशन में किसी भी डायरेक्शन में कभी
48:27
भी कोई एक बात बोली उसे पूरी क्लास के दौरान याद रखना जरूरी हो जाता है। सो पेजेस के इंडेक्सिंग का हाल हमने देख लिया
48:32
है कि पेजेस क्यों इंडेक्स होते हैं और कैसे उन्हें इंडेक्स करा सकते हैं। लेकिन किसी भी वेब पेज पर सिर्फ टेक्स्ट ही नहीं
48:37
इंडेक्स करता है Google। इमेजेस को भी इंडेक्स किया जाता है। वीडियोस को भी इंडेक्स किया जाता है। पीडीएफ को भी इंडेक्स किया जाता है। नाउ इमेजज़ और
48:44
पीडीएफ के लिए Google कोई अलग से ऑप्शन नहीं देता है। लेकिन वीडियो की इंडेक्सिंग के लिए Google अलग से ऑप्शन देता है। इस
48:50
प्रॉपर्टी में हमें वीडियो सेक्शन यहां पर नहीं दिखाई दे रहा है। इसी इंडेक्सिंग सेक्शन में दिखाई देना चाहिए। वो इसलिए नहीं है क्योंकि इस वेबसाइट पर वीडियो
48:57
कहीं पर किसी भी जगह पर पब्लिश किया नहीं गया है। अगर किसी वेबसाइट या किसी भी पेज पर किसी भी एक वीडियो को एंबेड किया जाता
49:03
है, ऐड किया जाता है तो Google उससे रिलेटेड इनेशन को आपको Google सर्च कंसोल में दिखाना शुरू कर देता है और वो कुछ
49:09
दिखाई देता है इस तरीके से। यहां पर आपको पेजेस के नीचे वीडियो सेक्शन भी दिखाई
49:15
देगा। इसके ऊपर हम क्लिक करते हैं और यहां पर सीन कुछ बहुत वैसा ही है जैसा पेजेस की इंडेक्सिंग में दिखाई देता है। ये
49:21
ड्रॉपडाउन भी आपको दिखाई दे रहा है। यहां पर लास्ट अपडेटेड इनफेशन भी दिखाई दे रही है। यहां पर एक्सपोर्ट बटन भी दिखाई दे
49:26
रहा है और यहां पर इंप्रेशन भी दिखाई दे रहा है। लेकिन अगर अभी आपको इनमें से किसी भी चीज के बारे में डाउट है तो आपने इसका
49:32
मतलब है कि अभी तक ये क्लास के ऊपर फोकस नहीं किया है। क्लास को दोबारा से देखिए। सो अब मैं वो एक्सप्लेन करूंगा जो अभी तक
49:38
आपने इंडेक्सिंग पेजेस की इंडेक्सिंग वाले सेक्शन में नहीं देखा है। यहां पर आपको पता लगता है कि आपकी वेबसाइट पर जितने भी
49:44
वीडियोस हैं टोटल उसमें से कितने Google ने इंडेक्स किए हैं और कितने इंडेक्स नहीं किए हैं। थोड़ा सीक्वेंस उल्टा हो गया।
49:51
कितने वीडियो इंडेक्स किए हैं और कितने वीडियोस इंडेक्स नहीं किए हैं। यहां पर आपको दिखाई दे रहा है कि इस वेबसाइट का
49:56
कोई भी वीडियो इंडेक्स नहीं किया गया है। नाउ वीडियो के ना इंडेक्स होने का मतलब
50:01
क्या है? राइट? इसका क्या मतलब है? क्या पेज इंडेक्स नहीं हुआ है या पेज इंडेक्स हुआ है? वीडियो मतलब ये थोड़ा सा
50:06
कंफ्यूजिंग हो जाता है कई बार बहुत सारे लोगों के लिए। तो इसे हम देख लेते हैं। एक बार एग्जांपल के साथ समझ लेते हैं कि आखिर
50:12
वीडियो के इंडेक्स होने का मतलब क्या होता है? वीडियो पेज के इंडेक्स होने का मतलब क्या होता है? लेट्स से हमारा एक ये पेज
50:18
है। राइट? व्हाट इज दिस? अ नॉर्मल पेज। एक पेज जिसमें बहुत सारा ढेर सारा टेक्स्ट है। राइट? इस पेज में इमेजेस भी हो सकती
50:24
हैं। वीडियोस भी हो सकते हैं। हु नोज़। बट Google क्या करता है? इस पेज को विजिट करता है। इस पेज के टेक्स्ट को अच्छा लगता
50:31
है उसे। उसे लगता है कि हां ये पेज का जो टेक्स्ट है ये यूज़फुल है। इसे मुझे इंडेक्स करना चाहिए। इसकी एक कॉपी अपने
50:36
पास सेव करके रखनी चाहिए ताकि अगर कल को कोई पूछता है कि मुझे एक नॉर्मल पेज से रिलेटेड पेज दिखाओ तो Google इस पेज को
50:43
दिखा सकता है सर्च में राइट 10 ब्लू लिंक्स में ये भी आ जाएगा लेकिन एक दूसरे टाइप का रिजल्ट भी होता है लेट्स से मैं
50:49
सर्च करता हूं Google पर जाकर हाउ टू टाई अ टाई ओके मैंने सर्च किया अब Google देखो
50:55
यहां पर बहुत सारे वेबसाइट्स के रिजल्ट को दिखा रहा है। ये भी दिखा रहा है। ये भी दिखा रहा है। यह भी दिखा रहा है। राइट? अब
51:00
बिकॉज़ ये क्वेरी ऐसी है जिसमें थोड़ा वीडियो गाइड से हेल्प मिल सकती है। तो देखो यहां पर Google क्या कर रहा है कि वेब जो Facebook का पेज है उसका यूआरएल
51:07
दिखा रहा है लेकिन साथ में वीडियो को भी दिखा रहा है। यानी कि ये जो रिजल्ट है ना
51:12
ये सिर्फ टेक्स्ट रिजल्ट नहीं है। ये वीडियो रिजल्ट भी है। यानी कि जो इस पेज के अंदर वीडियो होगा Google उस पेज के
51:19
वीडियो को दिखा रहा है सर्च रिजल्ट में। यही होता है वीडियो की इंडेक्सिंग। जो ये
51:25
इंडेक्सिंग में वीडियो से इसका मतलब ये है कि ना सिर्फ Google ने उस पेज का टेक्स्ट यूज किया है सेव किया है बल्कि वीडियो को
51:32
भी इंडेक्स कर लिया है। अगर इस पेज का वीडियो Google ना इंडेक्स करे तो रिजल्ट
51:37
दिखाई देगा वो इस हिसाब से दिखाई देगा। लेट्स से टाई टाई डॉट नेट करके इस पेज पर कोई वीडियो है या नहीं है। अगर होगा तो
51:44
मेरा लॉजिक आपको ज्यादा अच्छी तरह समझ में आ जाएगा। अदरवाइज़ मैं कोई दूसरा एग्जांपल लेके आ जाऊंगा। मेरा क्या जाता है? राइट? यहां पर वीडियो है ही नहीं। राइट? बट अगर
51:51
यहां पर वीडियो होता भी तो भी Google इसे नहीं दिखाता बिकॉज़ Google ने उस वीडियो को इंडेक्स नहीं कर रखा है। एक नॉर्मल रिजल्ट
51:57
इस तरह से दिखाई देता है जैसे टाई अटाई डॉट नेट का दिखाई दे रहा है और जो वीडियो रिजल्ट है वो कुछ दिखाई देता है इस तरह से
52:03
जिस तरह से ये Facebook का दिखा रहा है या फिर ये YouTube वाला दिखा रहा है। अब अब YouTube का दिखा रहा है तो हो सकता है आप कहो कि यार ये तो Google की प्रॉपर्टी है।
52:09
इसे तो दिखाना ही दिखाना है। बट इट्स नॉट हाउ इट वर्क्स। तो हमें इस इस इस कांसेप्ट के ऊपर नहीं जाना चाहिए। हमें ये देखना
52:14
है। ऑब्जेक्टिवली देखना है कि आखिर कोई प्रोसेस कैसे काम करता है। ओके? नाउ आ जाते हैं हम दोबारा से अपने एग्जांपल के
52:20
ऊपर। जब किसी एक पर्टिकुलर पेज के अंदर वीडियो होता है। जैसे यहां पर ये एक
52:26
वीडियो है। लेट्स से दिस इज द वीडियो दैट इज़ बीइंग यूज्ड ऑन दिस पर्टिकुलर पेज।
52:35
लेकिन Google उस वीडियो को रिजल्ट्स में दिखाने में यूज़ नहीं करता। इसका मतलब है Google ने वीडियो को इंडेक्स नहीं किया।
52:42
तो एक कोई पर्टिकुलर पेज जिसके अंदर वीडियो आपने ऐड कर रखा है, वेबसाइट ने ऐड
52:47
कर रखा है, Google उस पेज को इंडेक्स कर सकता है और वीडियो को इंडेक्स नहीं कर
52:53
सकता है। तो जब किसी एक पर्टिकुलर पेज के बारे में दिखाया जाता है कि इस पेज को Google ने इसका वीडियो इंडेक्स नहीं किया।
52:59
जैसे फॉर एग्जांपल यहां पर हम वीडियोस वाले सेक्शन में हम नीचे आ जाते हैं। यहां पर वीडियो इज़ नॉट ऑन द वॉच पेज। मुझे एक एरर दिखाई दे रहा है। 2 मिनट के लिए हम इस
53:06
एरर को भूल जाते हैं। यहां पर आ जाते हैं। यहां पे यूआरएल दिखाई दे रहा है। यानी कि Google ने इस पर्टिकुलर पेज को इंडेक्स
53:11
इसके वीडियो को इंडेक्स नहीं किया है। यानी कि अगर मैं इस पेज को विजिट करूं तो इस पेज के अंदर का जो ये टेक्स्ट कंटेंट
53:18
है ये जो ब्लॉग लिखा रखा है इस ब्लॉग को Google ने इंडेक्स कर लिया है। इसे Google सर्च रिजल्ट्स में शो भी करेगा। अगर मैं
53:25
यहां पर इसको कट कर लेता हूं और इसके बाद Google में आकर साइट क्वरी रन करता हूं।
53:30
तो यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं कि सर्च रिजल्ट्स में दिखाई दे रहा है। यानी कि Google ने इस पेज को इंडेक्स कर रखा है
53:35
डेफिनेटली। लेकिन इस पेज के अंदर जो वीडियो है उस वीडियो को Google ने इंडेक्स
53:40
नहीं किया है। यानी कि Google सर्च रिजल्ट्स में टेक्स्ट तो दिखा रहा है लेकिन वीडियो नहीं दिखाएगा। तो ये एक
53:46
प्रॉब्लम है। ये एक प्रॉब्लम इसलिए है बिकॉज़ अगर वीडियो को Google ने इंडेक्स नहीं किया तो फिर आपने वीडियो जो ब्लॉग
53:52
में डाला है, अपने आर्टिकल में, अपने पेज में, वेबसाइट में डाला है, उसका क्या पर्पस रह गया? यूज़ क्या रह गया? कुछ नहीं।
53:59
आपने उस वीडियो को बनाने में मेहनत की होगी, एडिटिंग में मेहनत की होगी, उसके प्रोडक्शन में पैसा खर्च किया होगा। लेकिन
54:04
Google उसे दिखा नहीं रहा है। उसे यूज नहीं कर रहा है। तो, वो उसका कोई पर्पस नहीं रह जाता है। तो, हमें अपने वीडियोस
54:10
को इंडेक्स कराने पर फोकस करना चाहिए। दिस इज़ द मोरल ऑफ़ द स्टोरी। नाउ, वीडियो क्यों नहीं इंडेक्स होता है, उसके दो मेन रीज़न
54:17
है। 90% ऑफ़ द प्रॉब्लम्स आती हैं इस इशू की वजह से। वीडियो इज़ नॉट ऑन द वॉच पेज।
54:24
90 से 95% आजकल तो 95% जो वीडियोस नई इंडेक्स हो रहे हैं वेबसाइट पर और बहुत
54:30
सारी वेबसाइट पर यह प्रॉब्लम मिलेगी ही मिलेगी। अगर आप एसइओ हैं, आप काम कर रहे हैं तो आपकी वेबसाइट के भी अपने बहुत सारे
54:35
वीडियोस इंडेक्स नहीं हो रखे होंगे और यह प्रॉब्लम आती है वीडियो इज़ नॉट ऑन द वॉच पेज की वजह से। इसके अलावा एक और इशू होता
54:42
है जो रिस्पांसिवनेस से रिलेटेड है। रिस्पोंसिवनेस क्या होता है? लेट्स से मैंने एक वेबसाइट को पे ओपन किया मोबाइल
54:48
डिवाइस के ऊपर और उसका जो कंटेंट है वो थोड़ा सा ज्यादा फैला हुआ है। क्या होता है फैला हुए का मतलब? सो लेट्स से कि ये
54:54
मेरा एक वेब पेज है जो मोबाइल डिवाइस पर कुछ इस तरह से दिखाई दे रहा है। ठीक है? नॉर्मल पेज सब कुछ अंदर दिखाई दे रहा है।
55:00
जो ये रेड कलर की आपको स्ट्रोक दिखाई दे रहा है जो आउटलाइन दिखाई दे रही है ये मेरे मोबाइल डिवाइस की विड्थ है। राइट? ये
55:06
मोबाइल डिवाइस के बॉर्डर्स हैं, कॉर्नर्स हैं। इतना मेरा इतना इतना इतना बड़ा मेरा डिवाइस है। लेकिन कई बार क्या होता है कि
55:12
जब वेबसाइट सही से नहीं बनी होती है, रिस्पांसिव नहीं होती है तो वहां पर इशू ये आता है कि जो वेबसाइट का कंटेंट है वो
55:18
कंटेंट थोड़ा सा ज्यादा बड़ा होता है। टेक्निकली किसी भी वेबसाइट को ही आइडेंटिफाई कर लेना चाहिए कि एक मोबाइल
55:24
डिवाइस की अपनी विड्थ कितनी है और उसके बेस पर वेबसाइट के कंटेंट को श्रिंक कर लेना चाहिए, एडजस्ट कर लेना चाहिए। लेकिन
55:30
वेबसाइट कुछ इस तरह से दिखाई देती है जो वेबसाइट की जो डिवाइस की विड्थ है वो कम
55:35
होती है। वेबसाइट की अपनी विड्थ ज्यादा होती है क्योंकि वेबसाइट अपने आप रीसाइज नहीं कर रही है अपने आपको। ऐसी वेबसाइट्स
55:40
में आपको स्क्रॉल करना पड़ता है थोड़ा सा राइट? स्वाइप करना पड़ता है। तब आपको पूरा कंटेंट देखने को मिलता है। ऐसी वेबसाइट्स
55:46
आपने भी देखी होंगी। दिस इज कॉल्ड नॉट अ नॉट अ रिस्पांसिव वेबसाइट। राइट? वेबसाइट रिस्पांसिव नहीं है। ऐसी वेबसाइट्स में जब
55:53
वीडियोस को डाला जाता है तो वीडियो भी कुछ इस तरह से थोड़ा सा बाहर की तरफ होता है। अगर वीडियो बाहर होगा पूरा दिखाई नहीं
55:59
देगा तो Google इस तरह के वीडियो को इंडेक्स क्यों करेगा? ये बहुत ही सिंपल सा एक काम लग रहा होगा। ठीक है? नाउ जो ये
56:06
वीडियो इज नॉट ऑन द वॉच पेज इशू होता है वो टोटली डिफरेंट है। वो इसके ऊपर डिपेंड नहीं करता है। ऐसे केसेस में आपका जो वॉच
56:13
पेज है वो कंप्लीटली सही है। यानी कि टेक्स्ट भी अंदर दिखाई दे रहा है और वीडियो भी जो है पूरा पेज के अंदर डिवाइस
56:19
के अंदर ऐसे आराम से एडजस्टेड है। लेकिन फिर भी एरर मिलता है। वीडियो इज नॉट ऑन द
56:24
वॉच पेज। तो हम ध्यान से पढ़ते हैं इस लाइन को। इस लाइन का मतलब क्या है? ये लाइन बोल रही है। वीडियो इज नॉट ऑन अ वॉच
56:31
पेज। यानी कि वीडियो वॉच पेज पर नहीं है। तो फिर वॉच पेज क्या होता है? अगर हम
56:37
वीडियो को वॉच पेज पर डाल दें तो वीडियो वॉच पेज पर आ जाएगा और प्रॉब्लम खत्म हो जाएगी और वीडियो इंडेक्स हो जाएगा।
56:44
करेक्ट? सो व्हाट इज़ वॉच पेज? हम आकर देखते हैं हम इस इशू के ऊपर अब क्लिक करते हैं। तो हमें यहां पर पता लग जाता है कि
56:50
कितने किन-किन यूआरएल्स में ये प्रॉब्लम आ रही है। एंड एज़ आई सेड अर्लियर 1000 यूआरएल मिलेंगे। बिकॉज़ यहां पर सिर्फ 38
56:57
वीडियोस के ऊपर ये प्रॉब्लम आ रही है। तो हमें 38 सारे यूआरएल मिल जाएंगे। अगर 1001 होते ये इशू 1001 पेजेस पर होता 10001
57:04
वीडियोस के साथ में होता तो सिर्फ 1000 यूआरएल मिलते एक रह जाता। तो अगेन जैसे पेजेस के साथ में होता है आपको पूरी
57:10
प्रॉब्लम खुद से जड़ से फिक्स करनी पड़ेगी। तो अब यहां पर सेकंड यूआरएल में दिखाई दे रहा है। फर्स्ट यूआरएल थोड़ा ज्यादा डरावना दिखाई दे रहा है। इसके ऊपर
57:15
मैं क्लिक नहीं करूंगा। सेकंड यूआरएल दिखाई दे रहा है। यानी कि इस पेज पर जो वीडियो था उसको Google ने इंडेक्स नहीं
57:21
किया है। पेज कौन सा है? यह पहले कॉलम से पता लग जाता है। राइट? डैश स्लैश रिसोर्सेज स्लैश गाइड स्लैश क्रॉसवर्ड्स
57:29
पज़ल ब्लॉग इसके अंदर वीडियो कौन सा है? यह वीडियो का यूआरएल मिल रहा है। तो, हम एक बार पेज को ओपन करके देखते हैं। ये रहा
57:36
पेज मेरा। ठीक है? ये पेज है। एंड मैंने अभी दिखाया कि ये पेज ऑलरेडी इंडेक्स हो चुका है। राइट? साइट क्वेरी रन कर रहे
57:43
हैं। पेज इंडेक्स हो चुका है। नाउ इस पेज पर एक वीडियो है जिस वीडियो को Google ने इंडेक्स नहीं किया है। अब देखने को तो ये
57:51
पेज सही सलामत दिखाई दे रहा है। फिर अब क्या वॉच पेज क्या होता है? वॉच पेज होता है। जैसे YouTube का एक वीडियो पेज होता
57:57
है। लेट्स से इसी वीडियो को जो ये वीडियो यहां पर इंप्लीमेंट किया गया है। एंबेड किया गया है। टेक्निकल टर्म होता है
58:02
एंबेड। इसी को अगर मैं यहां पर आकर देखूं तो यहां पर यह वीडियो का वॉच पेज है। यानी कि यह एक वीडियो है। यहां पर मेन जो पर्पस
58:11
है इसका इस वीडियो को देखना है। अगर यहां पर इस ब्लॉग पोस्ट को देखूं, तो ब्लॉग पोस्ट का टाइटल है स्टार्टिंग अ क्रॉस
58:17
वर्ड पजल ब्लॉग। यानी कि यह क्रॉसवर्ड पजल ब्लॉग के बारे में है। लेकिन जो यह वीडियो
58:23
है, यह वीडियो है कलेक्टिंग नेम एंड एड्रेस ऑफ पजल सॉल्वर्स। ये दूसरे सब
58:28
टॉपिक को कवर कर रहा है। वेबसाइट ओनर को लगा, डिजाइनर एसइओ को लगा कि भाई इसके अंदर ये एक वीडियो ऐड कर देते हैं। वैल्यू
58:35
ऐड हो जाएगी। तो पेज में वैल्यू तो ऐड कर रहा है, लेकिन ये पेज इस वीडियो को दिखाने के लिए नहीं बना है। अगर मैं इस YouTube
58:41
पेज पर आ जाता हूं, तो इस पेज में आप वीडियो ही देख सकते हो और कुछ नहीं कर सकते। करेक्ट? कमेंट वगैरह भी पढ़ सकते
58:48
हो। कुछ वीडियो में कमेंट ज्यादा इंटरेस्टिंग होते हैं। बट किसी भी YouTube पेज पर अगर आप जाते होम पेज के अलावा,
58:55
चैनल के पेज के अलावा तो जो वीडियो का पेज होता है उसमें मेन पर्पस वीडियो ही होता है। दैट इज़ व्हाट Google वांट्स कि आप
59:02
वीडियो को वेबसाइट के एक ऐसे पेज में डालें जिसमें वीडियो देखना ही मेन पर्पस
59:08
हो। करेक्ट? तो अब सो पहला क्वेश्चन तो ये आता है कि अगर मेरे पास एक ब्लॉग है और मुझे
59:14
लगता है कि ब्लॉग में एक वीडियो डालूंगा तो वो हेल्पफुल रहेगा तो मुझे नहीं डालना चाहिए। डालना चाहिए। Google सिर्फ इतना कह
59:19
रहा है कि आपने अपने ब्लॉग में जो भी वीडियो ऐड किया है ना उसको वहां पर बना रहने दो। हटाना नहीं है। लेकिन उस वीडियो
59:26
के लिए एक और पेज भी बनाना है जो सिर्फ उस वीडियो के लिए हो। उस वीडियो का घर हो सके। तो मुझे यहां पर करना क्या होगा कि
59:33
अब मुझे इस वीडियो के लिए एक और पेज बनाना पड़ेगा। ठीक है? उस पेज पर मैं सिर्फ
59:39
वीडियो को डालूंगा। ब्लॉग को भूल जाऊंगा। मुझे सिर्फ वीडियो को डालना होगा। राइट? वो होगा वॉच पेज। तो हम देख लेते हैं कि
59:45
वॉच पेज कैसे बनाया जाता है? वॉच पेज में क्या-क्या होता है? ताकि आप अपनी वेबसाइट पर हर एक वीडियो के लिए वॉच पेज बनाओ और
59:53
वो वीडियो इंडेक्स हो सके। ठीक है? सो, हम देख लेते हैं कि आखिर एक वॉच पेज कैसा होना चाहिए? वॉच पेज पर आ जाता हूं मैं।
1:00:00
ये एक बेसिक स्ट्रक्चर है। लेट्स से कि आप एक पेज बना रहे हैं। आपने दिल्ली ट्रेवल
1:00:05
के ऊपर कोई एक वीडियो बनाएं। मुझे abc.com करके वेबसाइट है। वहां पर मैं वीडियो को डालना चाहता हूं। मुझे वॉच पेज बनाना है। सबसे पहला वॉच पेज का एलिमेंट होगा उसका
1:00:11
यूआरएल। किसी भी वॉच पेज के अंदर जो वीडियो है वो यूआरएल के अंदर जरूर होना
1:00:17
चाहिए। जैसे फॉर एग्जांपल मैंने दिल्ली ट्रेवल के ऊपर एक वीडियो बनाया है। तो मेरी वेबसाइट का जो डोमेन है वो है
1:00:22
abc.com abc.com वीडियोly
1:00:28
ट्रेवल। ओके? यहां पर मैं इसको ऐसे भी कर सकता था कि लेट से abc.com
1:00:34
कैटेगरी कुछ भी हो सकता था। राइट? लोग करते हैं अपनी यूआरएल पर। लेकिन जब आप एक वॉच पेज बना रहे हो तो उसमें वीडियो होना
1:00:40
जरूरी है। तो लेट्स से कि अगर आप कैटेगरी को यूज़ भी कर रहे हो। लेट्स से यहां पर मैं वॉग करके कैटेगरी यूज़ कर रहा हूं।
1:00:47
राइट? तो वॉग आप बना लो। आप डेली ट्रैवल के ऊपर जो भी आपने एक्सपीरियंस किया उसके ऊपर एक टेक्स्ट ब्लॉग भी बना लो। ब्लॉग भी
1:00:53
बना लो। लेकिन वीडियो जो आपने बनाया उस वीडियो के लिए अपना एक अलग पेज होना चाहिए। और हम उसको कुछ यूआरएल इस तरह से
1:01:00
दे सकते हैं। abc.com वीडियो वॉग डेली ट्रेवल। तो वॉग का पेज एक अलग हो गया
1:01:06
लेकिन उस वीडियो का पेज अपना अलग हो जाएगा। नाउ यूआरएल के बाद पेज का टाइटल पेज का टाइटल एग्जैक्टली वही होगा जो आपके
1:01:13
वीडियो का टाइटल है। ज्यादा क्रिएटिव होने की जरूरत नहीं है। इसके बाद वीडियो को एंबेड कर देना है एज़ इट इज़। एंड देन इसके
1:01:19
बाद वीडियो का जो भी डिस्क्रिप्शन है, ये आप डिस्क्रिप्शन ऐड कर सकते हो। ये बहुत ज्यादा लंबा नहीं होना चाहिए। पर्पस क्या
1:01:24
है? वीडियो को दिखाना है। ऐसा नहीं कि डिस्क्रिप्शन में आप लगे पड़े हो। अगर हम YouTube पर भी जाकर देखें तो YouTube के
1:01:30
पेजेस में भी आप देखोगे कि जो डिस्क्रिप्शन होता है उसको हाइड कर दिया जाता है। देखो यहां पर आते हैं डिस्क्रिप्शन हाइड है। क्योंकि इस पेज का
1:01:37
पर्पस है ही नहीं ना डिस्क्रिप्शन दिखाना, टाइटल दिखाना वगैरह-वगैरह। सिर्फ उसको डाल दिया, ऐड कर दिया वीडियो का कॉन्टेक्स्ट देने के लिए। लेकिन मेन पर्पस है वीडियो
1:01:43
का वीडियो का दिखाई देना, वीडियो का वॉच होना। तो यह वॉच पेज है। वीडियो को वाचने
1:01:49
के लिए सिर्फ बनाया गया है। नाउ इसका जो एक थोड़ा सा एक डिफरेंट पर्सपेक्टिव है वो भी आपको ले लेना जरूरी है। बहुत सारी
1:01:55
वेबसाइट पे वीडियोस को बहुत अलग-अलग पर्पस से दिखाया जाता है। फॉर एग्जांपल अगर मैं आ जाता हूं डेंटिस्ट इन मुंबई सर्च करता
1:02:02
हूं तो आपको दिखाई देगी एक वेबसाइट। यहां ऐड मी दिखाई दे रही है। डेंटजी डेंटल काफी ज्यादा ऐड करते हैं ये। सो यहां पर हम
1:02:09
देखें इस वेबसाइट पर नीचे आकर देखते हैं। यहां पर आपको तीन वीडियोस दिखाई दे रहे हैं। बहुत सारी वेबसाइट्स में टेस्टीिमोनियल, कॉर्पोरेट वीडियोस, सीईओ
1:02:16
मैसेज वगैरह-वगैरह बहुत ऐड किए जाते हैं इस तरह के वीडियोस। ये वीडियोस इंडेक्स नहीं होंगे। राइट? यहां पर वीडियो इंडेक्स
1:02:23
नहीं हो रहा है। उसके दो रीज़न है। पहला रीज़न तो ये है कि ये वॉच पेज नहीं है। क्योंकि यहां पर इस होम पेज पर जो पर्पस
1:02:28
है इस पेज का वो है इस क्लनिक का होम पेज। मतलब इस क्लीनिक के इस ब्रांड के बारे में बताना ना कि वीडियो दिखाना। वीडियो
1:02:35
टेस्टीिमोनियल दिखाना तो इस पेज का पर्पस नहीं है ना। राइट? ये फर्स्ट पेज है इस वेबसाइट का। तो वीडियो क्योंकि पर्पस नहीं
1:02:41
इसीलिए वीडियो दिखाया भी नहीं है। वीडियो इंडेक्स भी नहीं होगा। राइट? दूसरा बड़ा सिंपल सा रीज़न है इस पेज पर तीन वीडियोस
1:02:46
हैं। अगर किसी भी पेज पर एक से ज्यादा वीडियो होगा तो Google सिर्फ एक ही वीडियो को इंडेक्स करेगा या किसी को इंडेक्स नहीं
1:02:51
करेगा लेकिन दो को इंडेक्स नहीं करेगा। दावा है मेरा। ओके? तो हम वापस आ जाते हैं
1:02:58
थोड़ा सा यहां पर। देखते हैं कि अगर आपने गलती से लेट्स से कि आप आपके जो वेबसाइट
1:03:04
ओनर हैं अह बॉस हैं वो यह कहते हैं कि भाई अलग-अलग टेस्टीिमोनियल के लिए वीडियो नहीं बनाना है। राइट? हम सभी टेस्टिमल के सभी
1:03:11
टेस्टिमल के लिए एक ही वीडियो बना देते हैं। यहां पर abc.com वीडियो टेस्टीमोनियल्स करके और उस पर हम
1:03:17
सारे के सारे वीडियोस को एक साथ डाल देते हैं। राइट? तो, यह वीडियोस इंडेक्स नहीं
1:03:22
होंगे। यह सही तरीका नहीं है। सही तरीका क्या है? सही तरीका ये है कि आप एक पेज बनाओ स्लैश वीडियो स्लैश टेस्टीिमोनियल्स
1:03:29
एंड देन इसके बाद लेट्स से पेशेंट वन जो भी पेशेंट वन का नाम पेशेंट वन मत डाल
1:03:34
देना रेफरेंस मिलना जरूरी है। ठीक है? तो ये हो जाएगा हमारे पेशेंट वन का वीडियो ऑफ
1:03:40
पेशेंट वन। ठीक है? फिर इसके बाद दूसरा पेशेंट आता है। उस पेशेंट का नाम यहां पे
1:03:45
आप लिखो और यहां पर उसी पेशेंट का वीडियो डाल दो। इस तरह से आपको सारे अपने
1:03:51
टेस्टीिमोनियल्स के लिए अलग-अलग वीडियो बनाना पड़ेगा। सारे कंपनी के जितने भी यू नो कॉर्पोरेट वीडियोस हैं उनके लिए
1:03:57
अलग-अलग पेज बनाने पड़ेंगे। उन सारे पेजेस को Google अलग-अलग इंडेक्स करेगा। एक बार आपने वॉच पेज बना लिया। ये पेशेंट 2 का जो
1:04:03
वीडियो टेस्टीिमल था आपने बना लिया है। बनाने के बाद अब आप उसे होम पेज पे यूज़ करो, कांटेक्ट अस में यूज़ करो, अबाउट से
1:04:09
यूज़ करो। एक ही वीडियो को आप मल्टीपल जगहों पर यूज़ कर सकते हो। कोई दिक्कत नहीं है। लेकिन Google वॉच पेज पर उसको इंडेक्स कर लेगा। कल को कहीं कोई क्वेरी
1:04:16
आती है टेस्टिमल रिलेटेड तो आपका वीडियो Google सर्च रिजल्ट्स में दिखाएगा। यह उसका सही यूज़ है और यही तरीका है वीडियो
1:04:23
इज़ंट ऑन अ वॉच पेज नाम के इस प्रॉब्लम को सॉल्व करने का। इस प्रॉब्लम को दूर करने
1:04:29
का और अपनी इंडेक्सिंग को ठीक करने का। सो, हमने इंडेक्सिंग सेक्शन के अंदर पेजेस की इंडेक्सिंग देख ली और वीडियोस की
1:04:34
इंडेक्सिंग देख ली। लेकिन यहां पर अभी दो ऑप्शन और दिखाई दे रहे हैं। एक है साइट मैप और दूसरा है रिमूवल। साइट मैप्स के
1:04:40
ऊपर क्लिक कर लेते हैं। जैसा कि नाम से पता लग रहा है साइट मैप क्या है? वेबसाइट का मैप है। राइट? यानी कि वेबसाइट में
1:04:48
कितने यूआरएल है, कहां पर? मैप का मतलब क्या होता है? कोई चीज कहां पर है, कितनी है, यही दिखाना होता है। तो वेबसाइट का
1:04:53
साइट मैप क्या हो सकता है? हम एक बार इसको विजिट करके देख लेते हैं। ये रहा मेरा साइट मैप का यूआरएल। मैंने
1:05:00
इसके ऊपर क्लिक करने की कोशिश की थी। नहीं हुआ। कोई बात नहीं। मैं ओपन साइट बटन के ऊपर क्लिक करता हूं। अभी आपको दिखा देता हूं। पहले थोड़ा सा मोटा-मोटी समझा देता
1:05:06
हूं ये कैसे काम करता है साइट मैप। सो जो साइट मैप होता है वेबसाइट्स में वो सिर्फ
1:05:12
एक यूआरएल की लंबी सी लिस्ट होती है। हम उसे मैप बोलते हैं। अगर हम इसे साइट लिस्ट बोलते होते या यूआरएल लिस्ट बोलते होते तो
1:05:18
भी काम चल जाता। लेकिन साइट मैप बोलते हैं तो आप भी साइट मैप बोल लिया करो। नाउ अगर आप अभी नए हैं एसइओ में तो आपने एक साइट
1:05:25
मैप के यूआरएल्स देखे होंगे। लेकिन वो दूसरे कॉन्टैक्ट में देखे होंगे। फॉर एग्जांपल मैं आ जाता हूं इंडियन गवर्नमेंट की वेबसाइट के ऊपर और मैं एकदम बॉटम में
1:05:32
जाऊंगा और मुझे यहां पर ये साइट मैप नाम का एक लिंक दिखाई दे रहा है। इसके ऊपर मैं क्लिक कर देता हूं। साइट मैप के इस तरह के
1:05:39
लिंक आपको बहुत सारी पुरानी स्टाइल की जो वेबसाइट्स होंगी उनमें दिखाई देगा और जब आप उनके ऊपर क्लिक करेंगे आपको कुछ इस तरह
1:05:46
से ये देखने को मिलेगा। राइट? यह भी साइट मैप है। लेकिन यह आपके काम का नहीं है। यह
1:05:53
एसइओस के काम का नहीं है। ठीक है? हमारे काम का साइट मैप क्या है? यह वाला। अब
1:05:58
इनके बीच में डिफरेंस क्या है? इसको हम देख लेते हैं। आ जाते हैं अपने पेज पर। सो, जब मैं बात करता हूं साइट मैप की, तो
1:06:06
हमारे पास साइट मैप दो तरह के आते हैं। एक तो साइट मैप जो एसइओस के काम का हो सकता
1:06:11
है फॉर एसइओस। एंड दूसरा होगा जो एसइओस के काम का नहीं होगा। ऑब्वियसली एक हमारे काम
1:06:16
का है, एक हमारे काम का नहीं है। नॉट फॉर एसइओस। नाउ ये जो दो टाइप हैं, ये टाइप
1:06:22
क्यों है इसके ऊपर हम नहीं जाएंगे। आगे हम देख लेते हैं कि कौन से एसइओस के काम के होते हैं और कौन से एसइओस के काम के नहीं
1:06:28
होते हैं। जो भी HTML साइट मैप है वो एसइओस के काम का नहीं होता है। राइट? अभी जैसे हमने देखा HTML साइट मैप हमारे काम
1:06:35
के नहीं होते हैं। ये हमें नहीं बनाने होते हैं। HTML साइट मैप का मतलब क्या है? HTML साइट मैप का मतलब सिर्फ इतना है कि
1:06:41
एक वेब पेज है और उस वेब पेज के अंदर बहुत सारे लिंक हैं। ये इसलिए हमारे काम का
1:06:47
नहीं है क्योंकि एक नॉर्मल HTML पेज है। इसमें डिज़ किया गया है। ये एक डिज़ाइन है। ये टेक्स्ट का स्टाइल अलग है, फॉन्ट है,
1:06:54
बुलेट लिस्ट है वगैरह-वगैरह। ये एक HTML पेज है जिसे Google इंडेक्स कर सकता है। लोगों को दिखा सकता है। कल को अगर कोई
1:07:01
पूछता है कि ये इंडियन गवर्नमेंट वेबसाइट के अंदर ये स्टोरेज वाला सेक्शन कहां है? तो मे बी Google इस पेज को दिखा दे। लेकिन
1:07:08
Google इस पेज के अंदर के लिंक्स को यूज करके आपकी वेबसाइट के अलग-अलग पार्ट्स को फाइंड आउट नहीं करता है। उसके लिए Google
1:07:15
रिलाई करता है अलग टाइप के दूसरे डिफरेंट टाइप के पेजेस के ऊपर। और ये पेज कैसे
1:07:20
होते हैं? ये पेज होते हैं सिंपल तरीके से अगर देखा जाए तो सबसे पहले टाइप का जो साइट मैप जो मोस्टली अधिकतर एसइओस बनाते
1:07:28
हैं जिसके बारे में आप देखेंगे जिसके बारे में आप बातें करेंगे। आपके टूल आपको मिसगाइड करेंगे। नॉट मिसगाइड। सही है बात
1:07:34
वहां पर। दूसरी चीज के बारे में मिसगाइड करते हैं। वो होता है XML फॉर्मेट का साइट मैप। जो साइट मैप वाला पेज है वो XML
1:07:43
फॉर्मेट का पेज होगा। साइट मैप डॉटXML ठीक है? अगर मैं आ जाता हूं वापस यहां पर
1:07:49
अपने इस प्रॉपर्टी के अंदर और आपको यहां पर दिखाऊं तो देखो हमारा जो यूआरएल है वो क्या है? निदाट cs पेजmap.xml
1:08:00
राइट ये पेज कैसा दिखाई दे रहा है? कुछ ऐसा दिखाई दे रहा है। इसको अगर आप सेव कर लोगे और सेव करके देखोगे तो ये एक HTML
1:08:07
पेज की तरह दिखाई देगा। राइट? अलग-अलग एलिमेंट्स के साथ में। ये भी थोड़ा सा हल्का सा डिज़ाइन कर दिया बिकॉज़ इसको बनाया
1:08:12
है रैंक मैथ प्लगइन ने बनाया हुआ है। तो ये थोड़ा सा हल्का सा डिज़ाइन दिखाई दे रहा है। बट बेसिकली ये कैसा दिखाई देता है?
1:08:18
अगर मैं इसको दिखाना चाहूं आपको। मैंने सेव कर लिया है। एंड सेव करने के बाद मैं इसे ओपन कर देता हूं तो आपको ये आपको
1:08:24
दिखाई दे कि ये XML साइट मैप का पेज भी जो है वो ओरिजिनल XML कैसे दिखाई देती है। सो यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं ये पेज कुछ इस
1:08:30
तरह से दिखाई दे रहा है। राइट? अब यह एक डिजाइनर पेज नहीं है। यहां पर सीधे-सीधे सिर्फ और सिर्फ लाइंस दिखाई दे रही हैं
1:08:35
कोड की और बस यही है। इतना ही यह XML फॉर्मेट का साइट मैप हो गया। Google इस
1:08:40
पेज को कंज्यूम करता है। इनके अंदर जो लिंक्स होते हैं उसको यूआरएल सर्वर को दिया जाता है और यूआरएल सर्वर उन पेजेस को
1:08:46
जाके विजिट करता है। आपकी वेबसाइट के पेजेस इंडेक्स होते हैं। डिस्कवरी में काम आते हैं। तो सबसे पहला टाइप का साइट मैप हो गया एक्सML फॉर्मेट का। ठीक है? XML
1:08:54
फॉर्मेट के बाद जो दूसरा फॉर्मेट जिसे Google सपोर्ट करता है वो होता है आरएसएस फीड। यानी कि जो आरएसएस यूआरएल्स होते हैं
1:09:01
या फिर कुछ प्लेटफॉर्म्स में एटम यूआरएल्स भी होते हैं जिनको यूज़ करता है Google साइट मैप की जगह। इन urls को भी आप Google
1:09:08
सर्च कंसोल में सबमिट कर सकते हो और इन पेजेस के अंदर के जो यूआरएल होते हैं उन्हें Google यूज़ करता है। XML साइट मैप
1:09:13
की तरह ही ट्रीट किया जाता है। तीसरा जो टाइप होता है वो और भी सिंपल होता है वो
1:09:19
है नॉर्मल टेक्स्ट फाइलtxt फाइल होती है। ओके? यहां पर जब हम देख रहे
1:09:24
हैं साइट मैप को तो आप देख रहे हो कि ये कुछ कुछ थोड़े बहुत इसमें ना hटीml टैग्स
1:09:30
लगे हुए हैं। लाइक ये पहले हमने एक डिक्लेरेशन दे दी। इसके बाद हम और इनेशन दे रहे हैं। फिर हमने यूआरएल टैग ओपन
1:09:36
किया। फिर एलओसी ऐड किया। फिर लास्ट मोड डाल रहे हैं। फिर इमेज के यूआरएल डाल रहे हैं। यानी कि थोड़ा सा कॉम्प्लिकेटेड लग
1:09:42
रहा है। लेकिन इसके अलावा एक दूसरा तरीका भी है जिससे आप साइट मैप बना सकते हो। दूसरा तरीका क्या है? और भी ज्यादा सिंपल
1:09:47
है। मैं एक नॉर्मल नोटपैड ओपन करता हूं। इस नोटपैड में यूआरएलs को डालना शुरू करता हूं। https
1:09:54
निधास ttca ठीक है दूसरा यूआरएल हो गया https

kिक्स बिग राइट जितने भी आपके यूआरएल हैं उन सारे यूआरएल को एक लाइन में एक यूआरएल
1:10:25
करके आप एक टेक्स्ट फाइल में नॉर्मली पेस्ट करते चले जाओ एंड देन इसके बाद आप सेव कर दो इस फाइल को लेट्स से माय डश
1:10:33
सmapxtxt फॉर्मेट में आपने सेव कर दिया इसके बाद इसे अपनी आप वेबसाइट पर अपलोड कर देंगे
1:10:39
उसकी होस्टिंग में अपलोड कर देंगे एंड देन इसके बाद हम उसे Google सर्च कंसोल में सबमिट कर देंगे हमारा काम हो जाएगा वेरी
1:10:45
सिंपल XML फॉर्मेट वगैरह फाइल वगैरह बनाने की कुछ भी जरूरत नहीं है तो ये तीन अलग-अलग फॉर्मेट है जिन जिनको Google
1:10:51
करेंटली सपोर्ट कर रहा है। कभी भी कोई पूछता है कि क्या XML के अलावा दूसरा साइट मैप नहीं हो सकता? उसे बोलोगे आप आरएसएस
1:10:58
भी हो सकता है, एटम भी हो सकता है, टेक्स्ट फाइल भी हो सकती है। नॉर्मल बड़ा ही सिंपल सा तरीका है। लेकिन इस साइट मैप
1:11:03
की कुछ शर्तें हैं। बिकॉज़ ये टेक्निकल फाइल होती है। इसकी कुछ शर्तें हैं। इसकी शर्तें क्या हैं? नंबर एक इसके वैलिड होने
1:11:10
के लिए सबसे बड़ी शर्त यह है कि पहली बात तो यह है कि ईच साइट मैप मस्ट हैव ओनली
1:11:16
50,000 यूआरएल्स। राइट? एट मैक्स
1:11:22
50,000 यूआरएल्स ही हो सकते हैं एक साइट में फाइल में। जैसे मैं अभी फाइल यहां पर बना रहा था। यहां पर 1 2 3 4 हो गए। राइट?
1:11:30
यानी कि मैं 14,996 यूआरएल और डाल सकता हूं। इससे ज्यादा यूआरएल अगर होंगे तो Google साइट मैप को
1:11:36
प्रोसेस नहीं करेगा। ठीक है? ये पहली शर्त हो गई। दूसरी शर्त क्या है? कि एक जो साइट
1:11:41
मैप फाइल है उसका साइज 50 MB से होना चाहिए। लेस दैन 50 MB। यहां पर हमने जब
1:11:49
50,000 यूआरएल्स डाले तो उसके बाद जब मैंने इस टेक्स्ट फाइल को सेव किया तो इस फाइल का जो टेक्स्ट फाइल डाली है मैंने
1:11:55
सेव की इसका साइज 50 MB से ऊपर नहीं होना चाहिए। अगर XML फॉर्मेट की फाइल है तो भी
1:12:01
उसका साइज 50 MB से ऊपर नहीं होना चाहिए। अगर आरएसएस एटम दूसरे किसी भी टाइप का
1:12:07
फाइल्स फॉर्मेट है तो भी उसका साइज 50 MB से ज्यादा नहीं होना चाहिए। और किसी भी फॉर्मेट में चाहे आप एक्सml बनाएं, आरएसएस
1:12:14
फीड बनाए, एटम फीड बनाएं, 50000 यूआरएल से ज्यादा नहीं होने चाहिए। 50,000 यूआरएल,
1:12:19
50 MB की लिमिट ये मैक्सिमम है। इससे ज्यादा आप नहीं यूज़ कर सकते हैं। सो आपको
1:12:25
साइट मैप के बेसिक समझ में आ गया। 50000 urlल 50 MB लेकिन उसके अलावा कुछ और चीजें
1:12:30
हैं जिन्हें Google यूज़ करता है कुछ नहीं यूज़ करता है। जब आप साइट मैप्स को बनाते हैं आप अलग-अलग वेबसाइट्स के साइट मैप को
1:12:36
देखेंगे तो आपको कुछ चीजें दिखाई देंगी और उसमें कुछ लोग ज्यादा टाइम वेस्ट कर देते हैं। तो हम एक बार देख लेते हैं कुछ और
1:12:41
डिटेल्स को। यहां पर मैंने साइट मैप एक जनरेट किया है दूसरे टूल से।
1:12:47
और इस टूल में आपको जब साइट मैप आप देखोगे तो आपको डिफरेंस दिखाई देगा। देखो यहां पर
1:12:52
जो एक साइट मैप एक्सml फॉर्मेट का साइट मैप है उसमें हमें एलओसी दिखाई दे रहा है। एलओसी मतलब सिर्फ यूआरएल है। है ना? ये ये
1:12:59
यूआरएल है। इसके बाद यहां पर लास्ट मोड दिखाई दे रहा है। लास्ट मोड मतलब कि लास्ट टाइम इस पेज को मॉडिफाई कब किया गया था?
1:13:08
और उसके अलावा प्रायोरिटी दिखाई दे रही है। अब अगर मैं रैंक मैथ वाला जो मैंने पहले यूआर साइट मैप दिखाया था आपको यहां
1:13:14
पर आपको दिखाई दे रहा होगा एलओसी इनेशन यानी कि यूआरएल। फिर इसके बाद लास्ट मोड यानी कि कब इस यूआरएल को चेंज किया गया
1:13:21
था। इसके बाद इमेजेस की डिटेल लेकिन एलओसी नहीं लेकिन प्रायोरिटी नहीं है। प्रायोरिटी एक सॉर्ट ऑफ अ फेक चीज है जिसे
1:13:30
बहुत सारे टूल्स काफी टाइम से पुश कर रहे हैं। Google प्रायोरिटी को कभी सपोर्ट नहीं करता। प्रायोरिटी का बेसिकली पर्पस
1:13:36
ये है एक तरह से ये लोगों की गलतफहमी होती है कि हम Google को बताएंगे कि देखो इस पेज को ज्यादा प्रायोरिटी के साथ में
1:13:43
क्रॉल करना है और बाकी पेजेस को कम कर सकते हैं। तो वन का मतलब हो गया कि होम पेज को हमने वन बना दिया और अगर इंटरनल
1:13:50
कोई पेज है तो उसको हमने8 दे दिया। यानी कि वन वाला ज्यादा इंपॉर्टेंट है और 8 वाला कम इंपॉर्टेंट है। लेकिन Google इस
1:13:56
तरह से हमारी बात कभी मानता नहीं है। Google इस प्रायोरिटी वाले इस इस इन इंफॉर्मेशनेशन को इस इस इंस्ट्रक्शन को इस
1:14:04
टैग को बिल्कुल नहीं मानता है। तो आपको प्रायोरिटी अगर लगाते हो अपने साइट मैप में तो आप कुछ नुकसान नहीं कर रहे हो।
1:14:10
नुकसान सिर्फ इतना है कि अगर आपका साइट मैप एक्चुअली में हैवी हो चुका है। फाइल का साइज बढ़ सकता है। उसके अलावा प्रायोरिटी कोई इनेशन की जरूरत नहीं है।
1:14:17
प्रायोरिटी को Google यूज़ नहीं करता है। लास्ट मोड को यूज़ करता है। लास्ट मोड को यूज़ किया जाता है। बिकॉज़ इससे आप Google
1:14:24
बॉट को एक तरह से बता सकते हो कि मेरा पेज लास्ट टाइम कब अपडेट हुआ था और Google बॉट हो सकता है इस इनेशन को यूज़ करके आपके
1:14:30
पेज को उस पेज को जो उसमें अभी चेंज हुआ ही नहीं है उसको स्किप कर सके। तो दैट इज हाउ वी कैन यूज़ लास्ट मोड इट इज़ यूज़फुल।
1:14:37
सो हमारी यूआरएल की इनफेशन Google यूज़ करता है। लास्ट मोड को यूज़ करता है। इमेजज़ और इमेजेस के अलावा वीडियो दो अलग-अलग
1:14:44
एट्रिब्यूट्स होते हैं जो साइट मैप्स में यूज़ किए जाते हैं। उसको हम बोलते हैं इमेज साइट मैप, वीडियो साइट मैप। बट हम उसको
1:14:51
थोड़ा सा आगे दूसरी क्लासेस में पढ़ेंगे। अभी नहीं करते हैं। अदरवाइज़ आपके लिए कुछ ज्यादा ही एडवांस हो जाएगा। सो, मैं वापस
1:14:57
आ जाता हूं यहां पर इस सेक्शन में। तो, हमने साइट मैप देख लिया कि हमारा साइट मैप किस टाइप का होना चाहिए। फॉर्मेट उसका कुछ
1:15:03
भी हो सकता है। अधिकतर प्लेटफॉर्म्स XML फॉर्मेट का साइट मैप अपने आप बना कर देते हैं। वर्डप्रेस में इसके टूल्स ऑलरेडी
1:15:09
अवेलेबल हैं। अ shoppाई या बाकी जितने भी प्लेटफॉर्म्स हैं वो आपको फाइल फॉर्मेट का
1:15:16
साइट मैप बनाकर दे देते हैं। जितनी भी प्रोग्रामेटिक वेबसाइट्स हैं जो कस्टम सीएमएस हैं वहां पर डेवलपर आपको अधिकतर
1:15:22
एटम या फिर आरएसएस फीड का साइट मैप प्रोवाइड करेंगे। जहां पर भी जो भी होगा किसी भी तरीके से साइट मैप आप बनाओ या
1:15:30
बनवाओ या प्लगइन यूज़ करो आपको साइट मैप का यूआरएल चाहिए यानी कि उसका लिंक एक बार
1:15:36
यूआरएल जब आपको मिल जाता है तो आप साइट मैप वाले सेक्शन में आओगे और यहां पर आप उस यूआरएल को ऐड कर दोगे यहां पर पेस्ट कर
1:15:43
दिया जाएगा। सो फॉर एग्जांपल यहां पर अभी मैंने एक यूआरएल पेस्ट कर देना है https
1:15:48
nhasitcap पोस्ट
1:15:53
smapxml ठीक है अब मैं इसे अगर सबमिट करता हूं तो
1:15:58
यहां पर ये सबमिट हो जाएगा ठीक है ये इसका बेनिफिट हो गया नाउ यहां पर अगर हम चाहें
1:16:05
तो हम एक दूसरे पैटर्न के साइट मैप को भी ऐड कर सकते हैं https wwwn nhas ttc cap
1:16:15
पोस्ट sitmap.xml अब यहां पर डिफरेंस क्या है? यहां पर नहीं
1:16:21
है। यहां पर है बट मैं यहां पर पेस्ट कर सकता हूं इस पूरे के पूरे यूआरएल को। बट
1:16:26
अगर मैं जाता हूं अपनी यूआरएल प्रीफिक्स प्रॉपर्टी के अंदर यहां पर और मैं फिर चाहूं कि मैं www वाला साइट मैप यहां पर
1:16:34
ऐड कर दूं तो मैं नहीं कर सकता हूं। बिकॉज़ यहां पर ये यूआरएल का ये वाला पार्ट पहले से फिक्स है। यूआरएल प्रीफिक्स प्रॉपर्टी
1:16:40
में आप यूआरएल प्रीफिक्स के अलावा किसी और टाइप का साइट मैप नहीं ऐड कर सकते हो। सो
1:16:45
फॉर एग्जांपल अगर मैं वापस डोमेन प्रॉपर्टी में जाता हूं तो यहां पर मैं एक साइट मैप ऐसा ही बना सकता हूं जिसमें वो
1:16:50
ब्लॉक के सेक्शन का होगा। ब्लॉक डॉट स्ट्रीट डॉट CA कर सकता हूं। लेकिन अगर मैं यूआरएल प्रीफिक्स प्रॉपर्टी के अंदर
1:16:57
जाता हूं तो मैं नहीं कर सकता ऐसा। ये डिफरेंस है यूआरएल प्रीफिक्स प्रॉपर्टी और डोमेन प्रॉपर्टी के अंदर का। तो ऐसा सिर्फ
1:17:03
एक ही डिफरेंस नहीं है कि यह साइट मैप की वजह से मैंने आपको बोला था कि एक दूसरी प्रॉपर्टी बना लो। बहुत सारे लोगों ने पूछा कि क्यों बनानी चाहिए? वेल इससे बहुत
1:17:09
सारे बेनिफिट्स हैं और धीरे-धीरे हम जब Google सर्च कंसोल की एडवांस क्लासेस में पहुंचेंगे आपको वो फर्क समझ में आता
1:17:15
जाएगा। लेकिन अभी फिलहाल ये पहला फर्क है जो यहां पर नोटिस हो गया और मैंने आपको बता दिया। वापस आ जाते हैं इसी साइट मैप
1:17:21
वाले सेक्शन में। तो जब आप यहां पर साइट मैप को सबमिट करते हो तो यहां पर आपको इमीडिएटली पता लग जाता है कि पहली बात तो
1:17:27
ये साइट मैप का टाइप क्या है? अब देखो टाइप मैप में एक्सml वगैरह नहीं लिखा साइट मैप और साइट मैप इंडेक्स दिखाई दे रहा। अब
1:17:33
ये साइट मैप इंडेक्स क्या बना है? सो साइट मैप इंडेक्स चीज है जो वो इस लिमिट को
1:17:38
बाईपास करने में हेल्प करती है। अभी मैंने बोला कि एक साइट मैप में 50,000 से ज्यादा यूआरएल नहीं हो सकते। तो ये तो बड़ी
1:17:44
प्रॉब्लमेटिक बात है क्योंकि अगर 50000 से ज्यादा यूआरएस हो नहीं सकते हैं और किसी वेबसाइट में लेट्स से कि 500 नहीं 1 लाख पेज हैं 10 मिलियन पेज हैं तो फिर कैसे
1:17:51
काम चलेगा वहां पर आता है साइट मैप इंडेक्स का तो साइट मैप इंडेक्स क्या करता है लेट्स से मैंने एक बनाया साइट मैप साइट
1:18:00
मैप वन इसके अंदर 500000 यूआरएल हो गए मेरे ठीक है फिर इसके बाद मैंने एक और
1:18:06
साइट मैप बना लिया इसके अंदर भी यहां पर थे वन से लेकर 50000 तक के यूआरएल्स सो वन
1:18:12
से लेकर 50,000 यूआरएल इसके अंदर हो गए। अब साइट मैप दो बनता है। साइट मैप दो के
1:18:18
अंदर मेरे यूआरएल हो जाते हैं 50,000 से लेकर 50,000 1 से लेकर 1 लाख तक के।
1:18:26
ठीक है? यह हो गए इस साइट मैप के अंदर की फाइल्स हो गई। इसके बाद मैं एक और यहां पर साइट मैप बना लेता हूं। यह हो गया मेरा
1:18:32
साइट मैप थ्री। और इस साइट मैप थ्री में कितने यूआरएल होंगे?
1:18:38
वन वन एंड देन इसके बाद 15000
1:18:44
150000 ठीक है ये तीन अलग-अलग साइट मैप मैंने बना लिए अब या तो मैं एक काम करूं कि इन तीनों का यूआरएल एक-एक करके यहां पर
1:18:52
सर्च कंसोल में सबमिट करूं यानी कि https nhaz treca
1:19:01
smap 1xml या तो मैं ऐसा करूं या फिर मैं एक काम करता हूं मैं एक साइट मैप फाइल
1:19:08
बनाता हूं। एक एक्सML फाइल बनाता हूं जिसमें अपने सारे साइट मैप्स की यूआरएल डाल देता हूं। तो यहां पर जो साइट मैप इंडेक्स होता है, ये एक ऐसी ही फाइल होती
1:19:14
है। वापस आ जाते हैं अपनी ड्राइंग के ऊपर। यहां पर हम बेसिकली क्या कर रहे हैं कि एक हमने साइट मैप इंडेक्स फाइल बना दी। ठीक
1:19:21
है? सmap इंडेक्स। इस smap इंडेक्स के अंदर मैं क्या बोल रहा
1:19:27
हूं? सिर्फ एक ही कंटेंट है। क्या है? abc.com sittmap 1xml फिर इसके बाद दूसरा
1:19:33
आ जाता है abc.com sittmap 2.xml तीसरा आ जाता है abc.com sittmap 3.xml
1:19:43
तो ये जो साइट मैप इंडेक्स है ना ये साइट मैप्स का इंडेक्स है। साइट मैप्स का
1:19:49
एड्रेस बताने वाली फाइल है। सो हम इस तरह से एक ही साइट मैप फाइल से सारे साइट मैप्स को उठाकर कनेक्ट कर देते हैं। हमारा
1:19:57
काम हो जाता है। तो एक ही फाइल है और उसी एक फाइल से सारे के सारे हमारे साइट मैप्स कनेक्टेड हैं। अगर मैं जाकर निधा स्ट्रीट
1:20:04
के साइट मैप इंडेक्स को देखूं तो आपको देखने को मिलेगा कुछ ऐसा सट मैप इंडेक्स
1:20:10
फाइल को ओपन करता हूं। यहां पर देखो साइट मैप इंडेक्सेस साइट मैप अंडरस्कोर इंडेक्स और यहां पर पोस्ट दैट पोस्ट डैश सइmapxl
1:20:18
पेज डैश smapxml कैटेगरी डैश सइmaxml मिल रहा है एंड दैट्स हाउ साइट मैप xml काम
1:20:23
करता है साइट मैप इंडेक्स काम करता है सो यहां पर जब हम आ जाते हैं वापस साइट मैप्स के ऊपर तो साइट मैप का टाइप दिखाई देगा
1:20:29
साइट मैप और साइट मैप इंडेक्स साइट मैप इंडेक्स यानी कि जिसमें साइट मैप्स का ही यूआरएल दिया है और साइट मैप मतलब जिसके
1:20:34
अंदर यूआरएल की लिस्ट है। फिर इसके बाद सबमिटेड किस डेट को सबमिट किया गया था। फिर इसके बाद लास्ट रीड यानी कि कब Google
1:20:41
ने लास्ट टाइम उस साइट मैप को पढ़ा था। यानी कि लेट्स से कि इस साइट मैप को 29th
1:20:47
अगस्त 2025 को पढ़ा है Google ने और इस वाले को सिक्स्थ मई को पढ़ा था। यानी कि
1:20:52
सिक्स्थ मई से बाद में अगर इस साइट मैप में कोई भी चेंज किया हुआ तो Google को
1:20:58
पता ही नहीं लगेगा क्योंकि उसके बाद इसने इसे पढ़ाया ही नहीं है। ओके? स्टेटस सक्सेस या नॉन मतलब अगर साइट मैप को पढ़ने
1:21:05
में Google को प्रॉब्लम हो रही है। अगर कोई टेक्निकल एरर है या फिर साइट मैप का कोई किसी ने डिलीट कर दिया तो यहां पर
1:21:10
आपको एरर देखने को मिलेगी। ठीक है? डिस्कवर्ड पेजेस यानी कि इस साइट मैप के अंदर कितने पेजेस मिले हैं? इस पोस्ट साइट
1:21:18
मैप के अंदर 50 40 पेजेस मिले। पेज साइट मैप के अंदर 27 पेजेस मिले। साइट मैप
1:21:23
इंडेक्स के अंदर जितने भी यूआरएल है वो सब मिला के टोटल नंबर आता है 66 और क्या कोई वीडियो मिला है या नहीं मिला यहां से पता
1:21:29
लग जाएगा। ठीक है? नाउ जब आप साइट मैप्स के साथ में काम करते हैं तो हमेशा ऐसा यह ग्रीन वाला
1:21:34
सक्सेस वाला मैसेज नहीं दिखाई देता है। कई बार ऐसा भी होता है कि आप साइट मैप के यूआरएल को सबमिट करते हैं और आपको यहां पर
1:21:40
रेड कलर से दिखाई देता है कुड नॉट फच कुडंट फच। अब कुडंट फेच एरर जो है वो बहुत
1:21:46
ज्यादा वेबसाइट्स में देखने को मिलती है और नए एसइओस को बहुत ज्यादा परेशान करती है। इसका रीज़न बहुत ही सिंपल है। सी कभी
1:21:52
कबभार Google सिस्टम्स हैं कभी कबभार बिजी होते हैं। कभी कबभार जो है वो थोड़ा सा बग है Google का अपना लॉन्ग स्टैंडिंग कि
1:21:58
आपने साइट मैप का यूआरएल डाला और उन्होंने कुडंट फच एरर दे दिया। ओके? ये 1 मिनट से
1:22:03
लेकर 1 दिन के अंदर प्रॉब्लम अपने आप भी सॉल्व हो जाती है। कुडंट फच का मतलब यह है कि Google बॉट आपके साइट मैप को नहीं पढ़
1:22:10
पा रहा है। उसने यूआरएल को एक्सेस किया। करने की कोशिश की और नहीं पढ़ पाया। यह आपकी वेबसाइट का इशू हो सकता है। यह
1:22:17
Google सर्च कंसोल की तरफ से भी गलतफहमी हो सकती है। बट यह मोस्टली 1 मिनट से लेकर 1 दिन के अंदर प्रॉब्लम अपने आप सॉल्व हो
1:22:23
जाती है। आपको कुछ नहीं करना। अगर यहां पर सक्सेस की अगर कोड एंड फेस दिखाई दे रहा है तो इसको आप इग्नोर करो। एक दिन बाद आके
1:22:28
देखना प्रॉब्लम सॉल्व हो जाएगी। लेकिन अगर एक दिन के बाद भी ये प्रॉब्लम सॉल्व नहीं होती है तो इसे चेक कर लेते हैं कि क्या
1:22:34
ये इशू आपकी वेबसाइट पे है या फिर ये Google के एंड से कोई प्रॉब्लम है। तो हम
1:22:40
देखेंगे कि एक्चुअली में Google बॉट फच कर पा रहा है या नहीं कर पा रहा है। और इसे चेक करने का तरीका बड़ा ही सिंपल है। यहां
1:22:45
पर मैं साइट मैप के ऊपर क्लिक कर देता हूं। एंड देन इसके बाद इस यूआरएल को कॉपी
1:22:51
कर लेता हूं। यूआरएल मैंने कॉपी किया और यहां पर इंस्पेक्ट करने की जगह पर मैं
1:22:56
यहां पर सीधे-सीधे पेस्ट करके एंटर कर देता हूं। अब यहां पर यूआरएल इज नॉट ऑन Google दिखाएगा। इट्स फाइन। कोई प्रॉब्लम
1:23:02
नहीं है। ऐसा ही होना था इसको। आप टेस्ट लाइव यूआरएल नाम के इस बटन के ऊपर क्लिक करें। नाउ यहां पर दिखा रहा है यूआरएल इज़
1:23:09
नॉट अवेलेबल टू Google। इससे भी डरने की जरूरत नहीं। हमें ये सब नहीं देखना है। हमें देखना है कि क्या Google बॉट हमारे
1:23:14
इस यूआरएल को फैच कर पा रहा है। तो यहां पर देखते हैं पेज फेच सक्सेसफुल। यानी कि
1:23:21
पेज फेच हो गया। तो अगर Google W यहां पर यूआरएल इंस्पेक्शन टूल के जरिए फेच कर पा
1:23:26
रहा है तो इसका मतलब है आगे भी फेच कर लेगा। सिर्फ थोड़ी सी डिले हो रही है कहीं पे भी। तो अब आप भूल सकते हो। अब आप छोड़
1:23:33
दो ये इस प्रॉब्लम को अपने आप सॉल्व हो जाएगी। अगर पेज फेच अनसक्सेसफुल दिखाता है यानी कि फेल्ड दिखाएगा यहां पर।
1:23:38
अनसक्सेसफुल कभी नहीं दिखाता है Google। फेल्ड दिखाता है। तो अगर पेज फेच के सामने सक्सेसफुल की जगह फेल्ड लिखा हुआ है। तो
1:23:44
इसका मतलब है कि अब आपको देखना है कि हमारी वेबसाइट में कोई प्रॉब्लम तो नहीं है। अब प्रॉब्लम क्या हो सकती है? हो सकता
1:23:51
है साइट मैप जो बना रही फाइल जो प्लगइन बना रहा है उसमें कुछ प्रॉब्लम हो। कई बार कैश या किसी और की वजह से ये इशू आ सकता
1:23:58
है। इसमें तरीका बड़ा सिंपल है। आप अपना अगर आप वर्डप्रेस वेबसाइट पर हैं तो आप अपना जो ये साइट मैप वाला प्लगइन है इसको
1:24:04
डिसेबल करते हैं। डीएक्टिवेट करके डिलीट करते हैं। दोबारा से वापस इंस्टॉल करते हैं। काम हो जाता है। अगर ये कस्टम कोडेड
1:24:10
वेबसाइट है तो जिस भी डेवलपर ने डेवलप किया उसको बोलना होता है कि भाई साइट मैप जो है वो एरर दे रहा है। साइट मैप को
1:24:15
रीजेनरेट करो प्रॉब्लम सॉल्व हो जाएगा। ये दो ही चीजें हैं। उसके अलावा और इसमें कुछ चिंता की बात नहीं है। कुछ करने की जरूरत
1:24:21
नहीं है। अगर आपने अपने आप से साइट मैप को बनाकर इसके बाद वेबसाइट पर अपलोड किया था तो आप दोबारा से बनाकर दूसरे टूल से बनाकर
1:24:28
अपलोड करो। नाउ जिन लोगों ने अभी तक कभी भी वेबसाइट नहीं बनाई है जो एकदम नए
1:24:33
स्टूडेंट हैं वो हो सकता है कंफ्यूज हो रहे हो कि मैं क्या बात कर रहा हूं कि प्लगइन में से डिसेबल कर दो, डीएक्टिवेट कर दो या कहीं से बनाकर अपलोड कर दो। डोंट
1:24:41
वरी। वी आर गोइंग टू हैव अ क्लास अबाउट वर्डप्रेस मैनेजमेंट। बेसिक वेबसाइट कैसे बनाते हैं? होस्टिंग को कैसे मैनेज करते
1:24:47
हैं? फाइल्स को कैसे अपलोड करते हैं? ये सारी चीजें ना ये हम अभी आगे आने वाली क्लासेस में सीखेंगे। तो अगर अभी कोई चीज
1:24:54
समझ में नहीं आ रही तो कंफ्यूज मत होइए। परेशान मत होइए। अभी रट्टा मार लो नोट्स बना के और बाद में ये सब कुछ समझ में आ
1:25:00
जाएगा। ठीक है? नाउ वापस आ जाते हैं साइट मैप वाले ही सेक्शन में और यहां पर आप देख रहे हैं आपके पास तीन साइट मैप हैं। लेट्स
1:25:06
से कि कल को आपके प्लगइन चेंज होता है। आपकी वेबसाइट में कोई चेंज होता है और आपके पास जो ये साइट मैप के यूआरएल्स हैं
1:25:12
इनको आपको हटाना है। आपको दूसरे नए यूआरएल्स को सबमिट करना है। तो वो कैसे करेंगे? यहां पर जैसे इंडिविजुअल साइट मैप
1:25:18
है। इसके सामने ये तीन बटन बने हुए। तीन डॉट बने हैं। इसके ऊपर क्लिक नहीं करना है। यहां से नहीं होगा। इसके ऊपर ऑलरेडी
1:25:24
क्लिक कर दीजिए। फिर यहां पर तीन डॉट दिखाई दे रहे हैं। यहां पर रिमूव साइट मैप का ऑप्शन आ रहा है। नाउ इस पर क्लिक
1:25:30
करेंगे आपका साइट मैप हट जाएगा। वेल एंड गुड। इट्स फाइन। हटा सकते हैं। कोई दिक्कत नहीं है। नाउ एक चीज़ है, एक फ़िनोमिना है
1:25:37
जो कई सारे एसइओस करते हैं और उन्हें थोड़ा सा धोखा हो जाता है इसमें। जब भी आप किसी नए आर्टिकल को लिखते हैं, किसी नए पेज को
1:25:43
बनाते हैं, तो लोग क्या करते हैं कि जल्दी से जल्दी आकर उसे यहां सर्च कंसोल में सबमिट करने की कोशिश करते हैं ताकि वह
1:25:49
जल्दी से इंडेक्स हो जाए। व्हिच इज़ अ रॉन्ग थिंग। क्योंकि आपकी वेबसाइट के ऊपर
1:25:55
Google बॉट का आना और नए पेजेस को ढूंढकर इंडेक्स करना यह ऑटोमेटिक प्रोसेस है। अगर आपको बार-बार खुद से करनी पड़ रही है,
1:26:02
इसका मतलब वेबसाइट में प्रॉब्लम है। राइट? आपका टेक्निकल एसइओ वीक है। ठीक वैसा ही
1:26:08
है। जैसे आप ना बीमार होते हैं, आपकी तबीयत खराब होती है, डॉक्टर आपको ग्लूकॉन डी देता है पीने के लिए। लेकिन अगर आप
1:26:14
नॉर्मली दिनों में भी ग्लूकॉन डी के सहारे ही काम चला रहे हैं, तो या तो आप खाना नहीं खा रहे हैं या तो कोई और आपकी बॉडी में प्रॉब्लम है। तो हमें ये ग्लूकॉन डी
1:26:21
बार-बार नहीं देना चाहिए अपनी वेबसाइट को। यह नॉर्मली जो है वह अपने पेजेस को पहले चेक करना इस तरह से सर्च कंसोल में एंड
1:26:28
देन इसके बाद उसको इंडेक्स करने के लिए रिक्वेस्ट इंडेक्सिंग वाला बटन दबाना यह गलत चीज है। यह नहीं करना चाहिए। वेबसाइट
1:26:34
के साइट मैप को हेल्दी रखो। साइट मैप को फ्रेश होने के लिए ऑटोमेटिकली फ्रेश होने के लिए जो है वो आप ऑप्टिमाइज रखें। एंड
1:26:41
देन इसके बाद वहीं से वेबसाइट को नॉर्मली क्रॉल करके इंडेक्स करने देना चाहिए। बट कुछ स्पेशल केसेस होते हैं जहां पर आप
1:26:48
साइट मैप को यूज़ कर सकते हैं अपनी वेबसाइट के फोर्स रिकक्रॉल के लिए। मतलब लेट्स से कि अचानक से जो है वो आपकी वेबसाइट पर कुछ
1:26:56
यू नो मलवेयर अटैक होता है या फिर आपकी वेबसाइट में कोई मेजर चेंज हुआ है। अभी डिज़ाइन चेंज हुआ है और आप चाहते हो कि
1:27:02
आपकी वेबसाइट के सारे पेजेस जो हैं उनको Google आकर फिर से क्रॉल करे। मे बी आपने वेबसाइट के बहुत सारे पेजेस में कंटेंट
1:27:08
चेंज किया एंड आप चाहते हो कि मेरी वेबसाइट दोबारा से पूरी क्रॉल की जाए ताकि ये जो नया कंटेंट है, नया डिज़ाइन है, नए
1:27:15
इंटरनल लिंक है इनको Google नोटिस कर ले। ऐसे सिनेरियो में हम साइट मैप को यूज़ करते
1:27:20
हैं। ट्रिक है आप आकर अपनी वेबसाइट पे या Google सर्च कंसोल में सारे के सारे साइट मैप्स को डिलीट कर दो एक बार। ओके? डिलीट
1:27:28
करने के बाद फिर से 510 मिनट के बाद फिर से साइट मैप्स को दोबारा से यहां पर यूआरएल एंटर कर दो। https
1:27:36
tt.cap पोस्टsmap.xml
1:27:42
इस तरह से आप यूआरएल को एंटर करें और साइट मैप को सबमिट कर दें। इससे क्या होगा कि जब आप साइट मैप को दोबारा सबमिट कर रहे हो
1:27:48
तो Google बॉट को फोर्स कर रहे हैं आप अपनी वेबसाइट के सारे पेजेस को यानी कि जो साइट मैप पे जितने पेजेस दिए हैं उनको
1:27:54
दोबारा से क्रॉल करने के लिए तो Google बॉट दोबारा सारे पेजेस को क्रॉल करेगा एंड आपकी वेबसाइट के जो चेंजेस हैं वो नोटिस
1:28:00
में आ जाएंगे। बट अगेन प्लीज रिमेंबर कि ये ट्रिक्स जो होती हैं इनको बहुत लिमिटेड तरीके से यूज़ करना चाहिए। स्टेरॉइड्स हैं
1:28:08
आप तबीयत खराब होगी फिर खाएंगे तो आपकी बॉडी जल्दी ठीक हो जाएगी। बट डेली खाएंगे तो बॉडी वीक हो जाएगी। तो इनको बार-बार इन
1:28:14
सारी ट्रिक्स को बार-बार झटके से यूज़ नहीं करना चाहिए। बिकॉज़ इससे क्या नुकसान होता है? एक्सप्लेन कर देता हूं। मैंने कई बार
1:28:20
बोला है अभी तक इस क्लास में कि Google सर्च कंसोल एक लो प्रेफरेंस लो मेमोरी सिस्टम है। बट मैंने ये नहीं बोला है कि
1:28:26
इट इज़ लो ऑन रिसोर्सेज या ये टेक में लो है। ऐसा नहीं लो टेक सिस्टम नहीं है। Google नोटिस करता है कि किस अकाउंट से
1:28:34
Google सर्च कंसोल के इन ऑप्शंस को कितना ज्यादा अब्यूज किया जा रहा है। एंड देन जब नेक्स्ट टाइम आप कभी साइट मैप सबमिट करते
1:28:39
हैं या रिक्वेस्ट इंडेक्सिंग बटन को यूज़ करते हैं तो आपकी रिक्वेस्ट को Google ऑनर नहीं करेगा। सो अब्यूज नहीं करना है किसी
1:28:45
भी ऑप्शन को। जब जरूरत हो तभी यूज़ करें। हर एक ट्रिक कीेंस ये होती है कि आप उसे
1:28:50
काम में आने पर तुरप का टिक्का है। ट्रंप का इक्का है ना उसको काम आने पर यूज़ किया जाता है। डेली डेली नहीं यूज़ करते हैं। सो
1:28:56
आई होप कि आज के बाद आपको साइट मैप और जो इंडेक्सिंग के जितने भी रीज़न है उनसे रिलेटेड कोई भी प्रॉब्लम नहीं मिलेगी। एंड
1:29:02
साथ ही में वीडियो पेजेस की इंडेक्सिंग भी आपके लिए बहुत आसान हो जाएगी। नाउ अगली क्लास में हम Google सर्च कंसोल को ही
1:29:09
कंटिन्यू रखेंगे एंड हम कोर वेबल्स के बारे में जानेंगे और साथ ही में एनहांसमेंट रिपोर्ट्स जो होती हैं उनको भी
1:29:14
सीखेंगे जो स्कीमा डेटा से जनरेट होती हैं। आई एम प्रिटी श्योर कि अभी भी हम अगली क्लास में Google सर्च कंसोल को पूरा
1:29:20
नहीं सीख पाएंगे। हमें एक और क्लास की जरूरत होगी। Google सर्च कंसोल एक लंबा चौड़ा टॉपिक है। और अगर आप अभी अपने करियर
1:29:27
अपनी लर्निंग जर्नी के शुरुआती फेस में Google सर्च कंसोल को अच्छे से सीख लेते हैं, अच्छे से समझ लेते हैं, देन आई
1:29:34
प्रॉमिस यू कि आपकी एसइओ की कम से कम 30% प्रॉब्लम यहीं से सॉल्व हो जाएंगी। आपकी अंडरस्टैंडिंग क्लियर हो जाएगी। आपके
1:29:40
कॉन्सेप्ट्स क्लियर हो जाएंगे। एंड आपको आगे आने वाली क्लासेस में बहुत मजा आएगा। सो मिलते हैं अगली क्लास में। तब तक के
1:29:45
लिए कीप लर्निंग, कीप प्रैक्टिसिंग एंड कीप अटेंडिंग लाइव डाउट सेशंस। मिलते हैं आपसे लाइव क्लास के अंदर। थैंक यू सो मच

Hello everyone, my name is Amit Tiwari from amittiwari.net and this is the next class of the Advanced SEO course. In today's class, we are going to continue the Google Search Console.
0:08
This will be the third part of the Google Search Console class, in which we will see the parts beyond the indexing coverage of Google Search Console, in which there will be removal tools, settings, crawl budget, and crawl stats.
0:19
If you have missed any class of Google Search Console or any class of this course, then please skip this video, first go and watch all the other classes one by one, and then come to this class, attend this class, then you will get the full benefit.
0:35
In every class, all the previous classes are referred somewhere, you will be confused, you will not understand everything.
0:41
Also, if you want to take full advantage of this course, if you want to ask your questions to me live, if you want notes, then you should join this channel's membership, which costs Rs.
0:53
29 per month, go to the channel's page, and on the subscribe button, you will see the join button, join it, and meet me in the live class on Sunday.
1:03
Now, let's come to the computer screen and start the topic of today's class.
1:09
So, in the last class, we saw the side map section, and now we will see the removal tool.
1:20
In the removal section, you will see three tabs here, temporary removal, outdated content, safe search filtering, let's know about all three.
1:30
So, why is the removal tool required? Let's say that there was a disgruntled employee in your company, who created a random page on your website, which is harmful, which should not be on your website, and Google indexes it.
1:43
Now, you go to your website and remove that page, you try your best, but still, that content is being shown in Google search.
1:51
Such scenarios can happen many times, and Google search does not provide any live support, where you delete a page from your website,
2:00
and Google immediately removes it from the index. So, in such scenarios, the removal tool helps us to remove any particular page from the Google index immediately.
2:09
How immediately? If you enter any particular URL in the removal tool, it is removed from Google search within 2-3 hours.
2:18
You will put a request from your Google search console, and it will be removed within 2-3 hours.
2:26
Okay, it will not be in the index. But here, it is important to keep in mind that this is a temporary removal. Now, what does temporary removal mean? If you remove any URL from the Google search index by using the removal tool, then it is only removed for 6 months, not forever.
2:39
So, does this mean that the page can come back after 6 months? Yes, it can come back, if you have not deleted it from your website.
2:47
So, if you want to completely remove a page from Google search, then you will have to delete that page from your website first.
2:56
When someone visits that URL, there should be a 404 status code. For example, if I come here and want to visit a URL, google.com
3:06
slash abracadabra. No one will say anything. Here, the page is 404. Okay. So, now this page is showing 404.
3:15
Similarly, if you want to remove a URL through the removal tool, let's say, the URL is abc.com, myceoisbad.
3:26
Someone has created a mischievous page like this. If you want to remove it, when someone visits this URL, then this URL should be 404.
3:33
Okay. In this way, a 404 status code should appear on this page. Once this 404 status code appears, after this, you will go to Google Search Console and remove this URL.
3:44
How will you remove it? Click on the New Request button. Here, we will type abc.com slash whatever URL it is.
3:52
Let's copy it completely and enter it here. After this, you can see two options here. Remove this URL only.
4:00
Remove all URLs with this prefix. So, this is an absolute URL on its own. Right. abc.com slash myceoisbad.
4:09
Now, I unknowingly typed abc.com, but the URL of abc.com, this is an American media company.
4:16
So, let's take an example of the property on which we work, nidhasstreet.ca.
4:23
So, I come here and type the URL nidhasstreet.ca slash unwanted-page. Okay. This is the URL of the unwanted page.
4:36
We have imagined an imaginary page here. Let's open this URL. So, here we will get to see 404 only because there is no page.
4:45
When there is no page, we can remove this URL on its own. It is safe. So, here we have entered this URL.
4:52
After entering, let's tick this option named Remove this URL. As soon as I click on the Next button,
4:59
Google will remove this URL from its index. It will not be shown in Google search results.
5:10
Now, 6 months means that after 6 months, when Google wants to bring it back in the index, it will visit your website.
5:18
And when it visits, it will see that there is no page named unwanted-page, there is only 404. So, it will not be shown in the search results again because now that page is not on your website and not in the search index.
5:29
So, this is called a temporary removal, but it becomes permanent if that page is removed from your website. If you have not deleted the page from your website, it can come back after 6 months.
5:39
So, you have to use it only when that page is removed from your website. Another case is that someone has created a lot of such pages on your website.
5:48
That is, the unwanted page is a category. There is a page 1, a page 2, a page 3, a page 4, a page 5, 6, 7, 8.
5:58
All those pages should not be on your website. You know the pattern now.
6:05
So, now how do we delete this pattern? We will delete this pattern directly. We have copied the previous prefix.
6:12
We have pasted it here. Now, after this, we click on the Remove All URLs With This Prefix button.
6:20
Now, the page 1, page 2, page 3, page 4, page 5, page 6, page 7, page 8, page 9, page 10 will all be removed from the search index.
6:34
You just have to paste one pattern here and your work will be done. Now, there may be some doubts related to this point.
6:42
And in fact, the biggest benefit of the Live Doubt Session is that when there are 4 students in the session, they always ask some unique questions that help you a lot in your learning journey.
6:54
It is not necessary that one doubt that has come to your mind will also come to the minds of other students. So, a lot of your problems are solved by someone else's doubt.
7:01
And this is the biggest benefit of the Live Doubt Session in any course. So, if you are still not a member of the channel, join the channel so that you can learn not only from me but also from your fellow students in the next Doubt Session.
7:14
Now, here, whether we use this option or this option, once we have entered this URL here, and then after this, we can click on the Next button here.
7:23
And here, a confirmation is being asked that we are actually going to remove this page for 6 months.
7:29
Are you sure? If you are sure, click on the Submit Request button.
7:35
Now, we have clicked on the Submit Request button. This is the Processing Request. If you see this after 1-2 hours, then this process will be shown.
7:43
That is, the page will be removed from the Google Search Index. The process will be shown only when the page is removed from the index.
7:49
Sometimes, the page is removed from the Google Search Index, but the Processing Request is shown here. So, when the Processing Request is removed from here, the process will be shown or it will be shown as Removed.
7:58
Right now, I don't remember exactly what status it shows. But this means that Google has now removed the URL from the Google Search Index of every country.
8:07
If you want to remove this request at any time, let's say someone has put this request here in mischief, then the way to remove it is very simple.
8:14
Click on the three dots here and click on this button called Cancel Request. The work will be done. Okay, this request has been cancelled.
8:21
Now, there is one more option here that is important to talk about. We come here and click on this button called New Request.
8:30
We enter the URL here again. And then we come to this tab called Clear Snippets. If you come here, Google will remove all the Snippets that are shown in Google Search Index.
8:46
The URL will be removed from the Google Search Index. And the Snippet that has been created using your URL will also be removed.
8:53
You can use any of the two options. Now, there are two more options here. Outdated Content and Safe Search Filtering.
9:00
If a user goes to Google Search and gives feedback, or complains that there is a particular page of nidastreet.ca that has outdated content, then Google tells you about such pages.
9:11
In this tab called Outdated Content, you will see which URL, which type of request, and what type of status it is.
9:17
But this doesn't give much feedback for most websites. Maybe you will never see any entry in your career.
9:25
But still, you should check if you get a property or a website for the first time. The third option is Safe Search Filtering.
9:31
If your website's URL is removed through a Safe Search Filter, meaning your URL's content is not considered family-friendly, and Google is censoring it, then you will get to know about it here so that you can remove that content.
9:47
Now, sometimes it happens that there are some medical websites, or makeup-related websites, or any website where an image has been classified in a wrong way, or interpreted in a wrong way.
10:00
you can see the URL here. Some industries like plastic surgery, cosmetology, aesthetics related.
10:06
In fact, sometimes in makeup and sports websites, you can see a body part by mistake, unknowingly.
10:12
And here, Google makes it out in Safe Search Filtering. So, you can see that URL here. And you have to go to that page and make the changes.
10:20
You will validate the request and then that problem will be sorted out. So, this was a big overview of the removal tool and that's all you need to use.
10:30
Sometimes, there was an option to remove the cache in the removal tool. But now, Google has removed the cache. So, we don't need to talk about that now.
10:38
So, with the removal tool, our indexing section gets completed. And we come to the section called Experience.
10:44
Why? Because experience means your user's experience with your website. Your experience, Google doesn't care about it.
10:50
So, Core Web Vital is the first entry in the experience section. But what is Core Web Vital? Core Web Vital is a way to measure the performance of a Google website.
11:01
And this is a very complex topic in itself. Core Web Vital is a pure technical SEO thing, which can look very challenging in itself.
11:10
And we will understand Core Web Vital completely in the coming section. Where we will talk about the different elements of Core Web Vital.
11:19
We will learn about CLS, FID, LCP, INP, etc.
11:29
All these abbreviations look like they are from the US government departments after CIA.
11:35
But all these are Google's acronyms, which you will learn about later. Like CLS, Cumulative Layout Shift, FID, First Input Delay, etc.
11:45
For now, in today's class, we will only know how to read this chart and what it means.
11:53
So, we can see two parts in Core Web Vital. Number 1, Mobile. Number 2, Desktop. Which means, how many of your website's URLs are good, fast.
12:07
How many URLs need improvement. Which means, they are not bad, they are not failing, but they are not good either.
12:15
And how many URLs are absolutely failing. You can see the same thing in both mobile and desktop.
12:22
Now, what is the importance of Core Web Vital here? Google started focusing on the speed of the website a year and a half ago.
12:30
They have been doing it for a long time, but implementing it, converting it into a ranking signal, Google started this a little while ago.
12:38
Now, it is very difficult to measure if a page is fast or not.
12:44
If we start measuring a page's speed while it is loading, then people will remove images and scripts from their websites.
12:52
They will keep only a normal HTML page which will load in a second. But such websites will not be helpful.
12:58
If a website's performance is measured on the basis of how many facilities, functions, tools and technologies have been added to it, then that website will load very late.
13:10
And in today's time, everyone has a shortage of time. Even if we spend our time on IPL or Reels, but when a page is loading, people cannot wait for that page for a long time.
13:22
That's why Google has spent a lot of time, money and resources to develop this technology, this measurement test, where a page's speed and performance are measured.
13:33
It is possible that I will mention speed in Core Web Vitals classes, but I will always refer to performance.
13:39
In the case of Core Web Vitals, performance is that a page is useful and is still loading comparatively fast.
13:46
So, we will not talk much about this now. We will just see how to read this chart and what is its importance.
13:52
So, let's say there are two websites. One URL is abc.com page1.
14:00
This is our one URL and it is passing Core Web Vitals. That means this is a good URL, it is fast.
14:07
The second website is example.com page9.
14:13
Both have the same content. It is not that the content is completely copied.
14:19
Both have the same information. Both have the same use case. Both have the same backlinks.
14:25
The reputation of both domains is the same. Absolutely same. So, which page will be ranked higher?
14:33
Who will Google give preference to? Passers-by will be given preference to abc.com page because its performance is better.
14:40
That means when two pages are absolutely equal in everything else, the fast page gets importance.
14:48
Why doesn't speed always get importance? Because, let's say, tomorrow Google says that we will give more rank to that page which will be fast, which will load in one second.
14:58
So, every person will remove all images from their website. So, they want the website not to be boring but still be fast.
15:07
So, when everything else remains the same, then Google gives preference to speed. This used to be a tiebreaker.
15:13
I say used to be because Google made a small announcement a few days later and they said that from now on, this page experience thing, this Core Web Vitals thing, will not work as a tiebreaker from now on.
15:26
Now, what it will do is, it will decide to be helpful to the page. That means if a website, a webpage has good content but its speed is low, it is not loading, it takes 10 minutes to load, and there are websites where it takes 10 minutes to load the website completely, then we will not consider that page to be helpful.
15:47
Which is right. What if it is big? Like a date palm tree, if there is no shade, if there are fruits, if there are fruits on the date palm tree, what is the use of that?
15:56
You can't break it and eat it. There are fruits, you have to use them. If the content is very good on a website, but that website does not load on time, then that content is not helpful for you.
16:05
So, Google started punishing such websites. So, now in today's time, it is very important for any website to pass in Core Web Vitals.
16:15
Right? It is very important to pass. How is it tested to pass? Where is it being passed? Which is the test in which it is necessary to pass the page?
16:23
So, this test is called PageSpeed Insights. We are going a little off topic.
16:29
You should read about Core Web Vitals later. But if I don't tell you the basics now, then this Core Web Vitals section will be incomplete here.
16:36
Understand a little bit. Those who are new, they will understand. This PageSpeed Insights is Google's own test where you can test any website whether it is passing or failing in this Core Web Vitals test.
16:49
So, let's enter Google here. https://www.google.com Let's see if Google is passing or not in its own test.
16:59
So, this test will run. After running, you will see the result here.
17:05
Now, this is the first thing you see. You see a fail here. Core Web Vitals Assessment failed. That means Google's own page failed in this test.
17:14
Which is fine. It will work. Who is this Google competitor? Okay. After this, you can see the score below.
17:22
Okay. What does this mean? The upper part that you can see, Discover what your real users are facing.
17:28
This is called Field Data. F-I-E-L-D Let's come.
17:35
There are two parts of the Core Web Vitals test. One is Field Data. And the other is Lab Data.
17:42
Okay. Field Data means when people normally use your website, when real users use it, how is their experience?
17:50
Is your website passing or failing on their device? What type of result are you getting?
17:56
That will be called Field Data, which is shown above here. And after this, the score you see below, this score is called Lab Data.
18:05
That is, when my laptop is used, my laptop's performance, my laptop's RAM, its CPU, my broadband network, when this website is tested, is it failing or passing?
18:19
This is the Lab Test. In the Google Search Console, what you see here, Good URL or Bad URL, this comes from this Field Data, not from Lab Data.
18:31
Some websites may be running fast on your laptop, but when your users are using it, your Core Web Vital is failing there.
18:39
And you will see a fail here as well, because real users are seeing a fail.
18:46
Now, I know this may seem very confusing right now, like I am saying again and again, if you don't understand something, then leave it for the Core Web Vital class, you will understand later.
18:54
Here, let's just understand that all the URLs of this website, let's go to the Indexing page once.
19:02
And let's see, there are 71 Indexed URLs. Out of the 71 Indexed URLs, 54 are good, they are passing the Core Web Vital.
19:13
So where did the rest go? Where did the remaining 17 URLs go? This means that the remaining 17 URLs don't have enough traffic for Google to generate any report for them.
19:24
Actually, there is no traffic on those 17 URLs according to Google. So here you can only see the data of 54 URLs.
19:31
When there is good enough traffic on any URL, the data will be shown here. Okay? 0 URLs need improvement, and 0 URLs are poor.
19:40
So everything is fine. On the desktop, you can also see that there are 54 good URLs, and the rest of them are okay.
19:46
They are nowhere to be found. Now, when in a website, in the mobile device section, a lot of URLs are not in the good category, they are in the improvement or poor URL category, then it means that your website, in general, is failing.
19:59
Because... When Google indexes your website, then mobile indexes it from Googlebot and not from desktop.
20:08
This is a topic that we have skipped completely. I didn't tell you, it's my fault.
20:14
Basically, when Googlebot was made for the first time, it was made for desktop.
20:20
The way it looked at websites was a desktop version. Googlebot, desktop and smartphones are different.
20:28
But they are not different in terms of architecture. The way Googlebot simulates the device to look at websites is the only difference.
20:38
When Googlebot used to look at websites, it used to look at them in desktop mode.
20:44
So, if any content is visible in the desktop, Google used to consider indexing it.
20:52
Now, over the period of time, when people started browsing websites, Googlebot followed the same pattern and now it looks at websites in mobile format.
21:04
So, if your website is fast on mobile, then Google will index your website soon.
21:10
If your website is unable to show any content on mobile for any reason, like technology is failing, responsiveness issue or any other problem, then that part, index or ranking of your website will depend on mobile device and mobile view.
21:26
Now, why is this a problem in itself? Because all the website designers and professionals always make their websites on desktop and not on mobile device.
21:38
They design their websites on heavy desktop with 4K monitor. After designing, they test the website and say that the website is fine.
21:47
But have they checked the mobile version or not? That's why we should visit mobile device to know where the problem is.
21:55
So, here you have to see how many URLs of your website are there. Is majority of the URL in good category or poor category?
22:04
If it is in poor category, it means that your website will not perform well in search results, ranking, indexing, because your
22:14
URLs are not performing well, Googlebot is not fast enough. Why will it take time on indexing and ranking the
22:22
URLs of your website? So, here we have to see which URLs of our website are not performing well so that we can index them.
22:31
So, for now, we will talk only about Core Web Vital. In the next class, we will see how to test
22:38
Core Web Vital, how to study it, how to fix its problems. All this will be in Core Web Vital's own class.
22:46
In fact, I have planned to make two videos in this class. In one, I will tell you theory theory and in the other,
22:54
I will tell you how to solve problems. If someone wants theoretical knowledge and wants to do deep dive, he will watch both classes.
23:04
And if someone just wants to fix it, he will watch only one practical class.
23:10
Because it is very, very technical. Not all people need to know everything.
23:16
So, we will focus on desktop. Otherwise, we will not focus on desktop.
23:24
And anyway, the actionable steps are the same. You just see the test results separately.
23:32
The next tab is HTTPS. If there is any issue related to the SSL certificate on your website, it is shown here.
23:42
This is also useful inside the property. Let's say there are many sections on your website.
23:50
So, let's say one is www.nidhastreat.ca
23:56
The second is blog. blog.nidhastreat.ca Then there is a support portal.
24:04
support.nidhastreat.ca Then there is a CRM portal or let's say a forum.
24:12
nidhastreat.ca You have made different subdomains. They have been built on different platforms with different applications.
24:20
If there is an issue related to HTTPS on a forum, the website is not opening on SSL certificate, the support one is opening.
24:28
So, in such cases, we get to know about these errors from Google Search Console. If your website is the same, if one URL is opening on HTTPS, then the other one will also be opening.
24:38
There is no such issue here. Take a look if there is any error. If there is any error here, then you have to fix it.
24:46
There is no such error in this property. We will cover this section in the next advanced section.
24:52
Then you will see. Now, here you can see two sections for shopping and enhancement.
24:58
In the shopping section, you can see product snippets, merchant listing, merchant opportunities.
25:04
In the enhancement section, you can see review snippets. You can see a lot of things here.
25:10
We will skip them now. We will skip them because all these features here, whatever information is coming, it is not coming from the content of the page.
25:20
It is coming from the schema data present in the page. Now, what is schema data? Where should you put schema data?
25:26
What type should it be? How should it be made? This will be a very long topic in itself, which does not come in the class of Google Search Console.
25:32
We will learn this after the content of the website. This is also a part of technical SEO. This is also a part of on-page SEO.
25:38
But we will not learn this now. Now, we will completely skip the shopping and enhancement section. We will learn schema data first.
25:44
Then we will come here and solve that problem. In fact, if you have learned schema data, then there is nothing to see here.
25:50
It keeps running automatically. Today, we come to the area of security and manual action. That is, whenever Google picks up your website and washes it, you will get information here.
26:02
Whenever Google penalizes a website, it gives a punishment, it de-indexes it. It de-indexes the entire website or a particular part or a particular page.
26:12
Whenever it does this, you will get information here. You will come to this part of manual action.
26:18
Here, Google will show you which URL of this website or which section or which part or the entire website has been de-indexed or given a punishment and why it has been given.
26:30
Both the issues are shown here. Whenever an issue is shown, Google gives an option to review it.
26:36
But the process of reviewing is very complicated. If manual action has come to your website, then you have to audit your website very closely.
26:48
After auditing, you have to apply for a review with a lot of documents. But right now, you do not have information about all these procedures.
26:56
So, unfortunately, we will cover this part in the last advanced classes.
27:02
The same thing is with security issues. If a malware attack happens on your website, Google thinks that a virus attack has occurred on your website, and from your website, the users of Google Search are at risk of being harmed, then you get security warnings which you fix after Google informs you.
27:22
But again, if there is a security issue on your website and you are aware of it from Google Search Console, then it means that you are not focusing on your website.
27:32
If there is a security issue on Google Search Console, it means that you have already lost your ranking, reputation, reputation, etc.
27:42
Now, after this, there is a link section and a settings section.
27:48
We will come to the settings section and not the link section. In the settings section, you will see a lot of options.
27:56
Then we come to the robots.txt section. See, we just saw the sitemap file in the sitemap section.
28:04
Now, you are going to see the second important file, which is robots.txt. robots.txt is a very important file.
28:10
It is a file which decides which part of your website will be visited by
28:18
Google Bot or other reputed search engines. Keep in mind, which part will be visited and which part will not be visited.
28:29
I have not said index. The students who have taken all the classes one by one, they know that we have talked about 5 steps of search engines.
28:39
No. 1 is discovery, No. 2 is crawling, No. 3 is rendering,
28:45
No. 4 is indexing, and No. 5 is ranking. Here we are talking about indexing.
28:53
So, get rid of both robots.txt and indexing. It is just a tool to control crawling.
28:59
Now, you can see the robots.txt option here. Click on the open report button.
29:05
This is a comparatively new option. Earlier, Google Search used robots.txt.
29:13
But, there was no inclusion or diagnostic tool of robots.txt in Search Console.
29:19
So, it is a good thing. It is a good option. Here, you can see the robots.txt files of your website.
29:27
Every website on the internet has a robots.txt file. It is not harmful for SEO.
29:35
If there is no robots.txt file on any website, then it is not harmful.
29:41
It is just that Googlebot can visit every page, directory, and URL of your website.
29:47
So, don't refuse to visit any website. Let's visit a website and pick up the URL of any website.
29:53
Let's say, Paytm. www.paytm.com www.paytm.com www.paytm.com This is Paytm's robots.txt
30:02
Once I made a video 2-3 years ago and made a joke of Paytm that the robots.txt file of Paytm had 4,311 lines in it.
30:13
I think someone has seen the video and now robots.txt has become very small. Other than this, if I go to Amazon.com other than Paytm, I will type its robots.txt URL
30:26
Amazon.com you will get robots.txt If you go to Walmart's website or Flipkart's website or Google's website or any website, in front of its home page URL you have to type slash robots.txt you will get the robots.txt file which is a public file on every website, it is on the same address
30:50
If you want Google or any search engine to use your website's robots.txt file then it should be on the same address slash robots.txt r-o-b-o-t-s .txt, it is a text file in which we give instructions in a simple language it may look confusing but it is
31:09
a very simple language the first one is user agent Googlebot what is Googlebot? it is a crawler of Google its user agent is Googlebot it will become Bing's Bingbot there are many different types of bots so when user agent is written it means for which bot are these instructions user agent, then star star
31:34
means everything star means wildcard wildcard means this rule applies for all types of bots here it is written disallow block this section is disallowed this is also disallowed this is also disallowed this is also disallowed this is also disallowed here
31:55
this block no one can go inside the url if any Googlebot paytm.com let me copy this
32:08
paytm.com slash blog slash wp dash login if Googlebot wants to go on the url then it cannot go even if someone gives a link because here we have disallowed so we have controlled that Googlebot cannot go on this url if here slash blog was written in disallow
32:35
rule then paytm.com slash blog slash page 1 cannot go slash page 2 cannot go slash page 3,4,5,6 any url part
32:48
Googlebot cannot visit because it has slash blog slash in any part this is robots.txt own function we can tell Googlebot which part to visit and which not basically we only tell which part to visit and which not because the one you disallow Googlebot
33:15
automatically here we have disallowed rules user agent adsbot user agent adsbot for Google all pages are allowed so Google adsbot for mobile apps can see all pages and other user agent bots like bing,openAI,cloud google search engine bot all these urls
33:44
are disallowed that's it robots.txt has many things to share how to format and upload but we will not go on robots.txt like a sitemap we will make robots.txt from scratch how to navigate how to use how to use robots.txt for this domain different urls
34:13
robots.txt you can see different versions http,https,http www https www for Google all urls are different but for Google they are different you have to remember in your life as long as you are working in SEO different versions of urls are treated as different
34:41
properties don't treat them as same
34:50
I wanted to show you this issue that's why I selected this domain but in your domain you should see only one file https, www or without www that will work if you see 4 files together how to solve this we will see that later because this is a simple redirect
35:10
rule which you have to do in your htaccess file and all these issues will be sorted out now you have 3 words sitemap.xml, robots.txt and htaccess file these 3 files are there in almost every website where they are used for different tasks there will be
35:30
3 different classes so for example I will take only one sitemap url https nidhasree.ca slash robots.txt when was this checked for the first time 1st January 2025 google is using
35:48
US format 1-9-2025 9th January 1-10-PM it was successfully fetched and then 24 byte robots.txt if there was any issue there is no issue click on 3 dots request a re-crawl option let's say you have changed something in robots.txt you want google to immediately
36:12
notice the changes you can request a re-crawl you don't have to do it again and again
36:22
I know many of you are thinking I wish there was a similar option with sitemap request a re-crawl you can request a re-crawl let's check as soon as you click you will get a preview of robots.txt what is written in it disallowed nothing user agent basically it's an open empty robots.txt
36:51
no rules SEO point of view is completely fine no issues there is a tab called versions you will get previous versions of robots.txt let's say let's say one of your staff colleague or employee accidentally changed something in robots.txt you will get to know what
37:14
happened before and what is it now you will see these versions like a list whichever version you click you will see that version open you can restore it whatever it is you will get a preview of the previous version there are some videos on robots.txt
37:34
you can watch them link is in the top right corner these are old videos but still applicable no issues if you are already an SEO professional you don't need basic you can learn about robots.txt right now when google launched robots.txt i did a detailed
37:55
video in which all these features are explained in detail but right now you don't need them you just need to know how google is viewing robots.txt file you can see there is no option to submit robots.txt file anywhere because there is only one location
38:15
of robots.txt site map location can be different you can make a site map you can make a site map url for example you can use sitemap.xml after coming to another domain you can use sitemap sitemap1.xml you can make an internal folder and inside that you
38:36
can use mysitemap.xml you can use mysitemap.xml in sitemap you can use different file names you can use folder names you can use folder names it will be accepted but in case of robots.txt there is only one option robots.txt robots.txt robots.txt you can't
38:57
change name you can't change location so if your website has robots.txt file it will be visible google will notice it it will show you in search console if there is any problem it will be visible but there is no need to submit because it is in one location
39:18
so this was robots.txt section after this we come to another important section which is crawl stats here we click on open report now this crawl stats will tell you many things crawl stats means how googlebot is crawling your website what problems it is
39:39
facing how many times it is crawling how much data it is consuming what is the speed crawl stats report is a very important report to solve all the complicated problems on the website when we pick up our bags like this then the crawl stats are the first
40:00
report on which we come and show our stuff.
40:09
This is where we start our analysis. Here, first of all, you will have to see that this report is of the last three months.
40:16
Neither can you reduce it nor can you increase it. You will get a three-month report. And here, in three months, how many times has Googlebot tried to crawl this website? 10.5 thousand times.
40:30
10.5 thousand times, Googlebot has requested to crawl this website, any URL.
40:36
Total crawl request. This can be of a webpage or images.
40:42
As many times as Googlebot has requested to access any file or URL on your server, it will be shown here.
40:51
In these 10.5 thousand times, how much data has been downloaded? In bytes, that is 190 million.
40:57
And then, what is the average response time? That is, when Googlebot tries to access your website, at what time does your server start responding? That is, one is to try to request your server.
41:15
This is Googlebot and this is the website's server. A request comes from Googlebot to the server.
41:22
After this, the server starts responding. The request you have to send and the reply you have to receive, what is the distance between the two?
41:34
How much time is it taking? I ask you a question and you think for a while, you are taking time to respond.
41:43
I ask you, what are the canonical types? If you are taking 2 minutes to think, this is what I wanted to tell you.
41:52
The average response time is measured in milliseconds. 152 milliseconds means 0.152 seconds.
41:58
If the average response time is more, then Googlebot will feel that your website is slow.
42:07
This is also counted in Core Web Vital. If you want to know the average response time according to Google's worldwide experience, your website's average response time should be less than 1000 milliseconds.
42:19
I am saying worldwide because in India, unfortunately, the average response time of all India-specific hosting is less.
42:28
There are big brands whose website's average response time is between 500 to 1000.
42:34
If your average response time is more than 1000 milliseconds, then Core Web Vital is a way to speed up the website.
42:40
Don't look at the plugin, first upgrade the hosting. The average response time above 1000 milliseconds is deadly.
42:46
It will never let the website perform well in indexing, crawling, or ranking.
42:52
So, it should be below 1000 milliseconds. But if you want to do your best, if you want Googlebot to love your website, index it again and again, and crawl it again, then it should be below 200 milliseconds.
43:07
I guess they are using GoDaddy's plan, but the average response time is between 200 to 500 milliseconds.
43:13
Don't go above 500 milliseconds. If it is above 1000 milliseconds, then completely change the hosting.
43:22
So, here you can see the crawl request and the average response time. Mostly, you will see that their relation is opposite.
43:28
When the average response time is more, then the crawling becomes less.
43:34
When the average response time is less, then the crawling becomes more. So, if your hosting company is fast, then the crawling will be more.
43:41
If it is slow, then the crawling will be less. It makes sense. Googlebot optimizes itself in this way. I almost never check the total download size.
43:49
There are very specific and complicated cases where I have to click the middle toggle.
43:55
That's why I am not clicking it to show you. Right now, it is out of the scope of this course.
44:01
But this is the size. Basically, this tells us how the URL is being crawled and how much data is being consumed.
44:10
Then, we compare it with the page size or the size of the asset.
44:16
Then, we do the mathematics. But, right now, you don't need it. Let's come down here.
44:22
You will see a host section. This is because it is a domain property.
44:28
If I go to the URL prefix property, then the host section will disappear. This is because there is only one domain.
44:34
That's why the data is missing. Now, it is showing the host status. Let's see what it is.
44:40
Host means that all the sub-domains or URL prefix properties in a domain are called hosts.
44:46
Now, what is the status of this host? Let me come back to the domain property so that there is no confusion.
44:52
If I click on this host, then we can see the host status.
44:58
Now, let's see the status of this property. What is the status of this host?
45:04
Is this hosting company running or not? If we click on this, we will get three results.
45:10
Number one, robots.txt fetch. If we click on this, we will get a three-month graph.
45:16
That means, if it happens that in the last three months,
45:22
Googlebot tried to fetch your robots.txt and the host did not provide the file.
45:28
The hosting company was down. So, it will look like an error spike.
45:34
Here, it is almost 0%. There is no problem.
45:40
DNS resolution means that if there is any problem in resolving DNS, where your domain register is working, that is, where your domain register is working, from where your DNS records are being resolved, and if that service creates a problem somewhere,
45:55
then it will be found out here. Or if the server of this website is failing somewhere, at any particular time, when the user wants to visit the website, and the server is down, and is not allowing the website to open, then it will be found out here.
46:13
When you are trying to solve technical challenges, maybe you feel that there is a problem with your website, then this thing is found out from here.
46:22
Always, if you are trying to solve a challenge in Google Search Console, come here and see if your hosting is failing somewhere.
46:28
If robots.txt is not being fetched, or there is an issue in the server connectivity of the host, or there is an issue in the DNS resolution, talk to your hosting company, give them a screenshot, and tell them why the hosting company is ducking, when you
46:42
have taken the money, then why are you not providing the service. Okay? Below this, there is a breakdown of some crawl requests.
46:51
Breakdown means that here you can see OK, 304, 404, these errors are visible.
47:00
Whenever Googlebot tries to visit any URL of your website, what is the status code you get?
47:06
We talked about the status code a while ago. If I open the developer tools here, and refresh it again, it came to the network tab.
47:15
I refreshed the network tab again. Here you can see the first particular URL.
47:21
What is the status code? It is HTTP status code 200. We talked about the status code.
47:27
If any of you want to know about the HTTP status code in detail right now, then we have a video. It is a little old, but still valid.
47:33
All these technical details have been going on for decades. It is still valid. You can go and watch that video.
47:39
Otherwise, we will also take a live fresh class. Here you can see the status code 200.
47:45
If I enter an extra URL here, let's say I intentionally malformed this URL.
47:51
Now I will try to open it. What is the status code of my URL? 404, not found.
47:57
It has become red. Similarly, different URLs give different status codes of your website.
48:03
Here you can see the report of these different status codes. That is, when 10.5,000, no no, 10.5,000 to 4,000 is switched off.
48:13
That is, the next report will come. No need to worry. It will not show the wrong report. It keeps happening. So this 10.5,000 to 10.4,000 request, 89% of it is OK.
48:24
Meaning that 89% of the time, whichever URL request is made by Googlebot, it is sending the URL to this website's server, that means 404 is not a problem on the server.
48:37
304 means that there is no change in this URL. 304 status code comes only when there is no change in any page.
48:44
So the browser or the server basically tells that there is no change in this URL, 304. There is no need to crawl it again.
48:51
404 means that it is not an asset. Now this 404 is not like this 404.
48:58
When we were looking at the indexing here, the reasons for different not indexed, there is a 404 here too.
49:05
It is not visible in this property. If I open the DelhiBelly.site, then I can see 404 here.
49:11
But this 404 is not like the 404 with the crawl stats. Why? Because what is visible here, in the indexing section, we can see the HTML URL 404.
49:24
If you have a CSS URL 404, or if you have another asset URL 404 status code, that is, it is not available, then it will not be visible here.
49:36
It will be visible here. Let's go back to the report again. Here you can see the 404 percentage.
49:47
So you always have to try that the 404s of your website should not be more than 10% in this section, in the crawl stats report.
49:56
If you can see 404 above 10%, then your website is technically good. If you can't figure it out yourself, then you need to hire a consultant.
50:04
But here the number 404 should not be more than 10%. Keep it in a single digit, 9% or low.
50:11
Okay. Now you will say that when we were looking inside the indexing report, there I said 404 is not a problem.
50:17
Because it is for HTML pages. Here your assets are related. If it is more than 10%, it means that there are a lot of broken assets on your website.
50:25
Which I don't know why they are there. They shouldn't be there. You shouldn't even provide them. Correct. So here we see that.
50:33
You can get some more status codes here. They are within the timeline. You don't have to worry more than this.
50:39
What I always see here is that what is the percentage of 404. It is above 10. So I need to analyze more. Below 10, it's fine.
50:46
Apart from this, here is the by file type. That is, on this website, 37% of the time Googlebot is visiting the JavaScript file.
50:55
Dealing with them. This number can be different on different websites. It depends on the structure. It depends on the use case.
51:02
If it is a photographer's website, there are a lot of images. So it will crawl more images. There is nothing to worry about. In most cases, it doesn't do anything.
51:10
After this, the ratio of purpose and discovery comes here. That is, how many times Googlebot is visiting your website.
51:17
So it is getting new content. And how many times it is just refreshing. That is, it is visiting the old content again and again.
51:24
95% of the time, Googlebot is visiting the old content. And only 5% of the time, it is getting new content.
51:31
If new content is being posted on your website at a very fast speed.
51:37
And still this percentage is low. So it means that Googlebot is facing the issue of crawl budget on your website.
51:45
That is, new content is coming to your website. But Googlebot is not able to visit it. Because it is busy with old useless URLs.
51:54
So in such cases, you should talk about the optimization of your crawl budget. You should solve it.
52:00
But again your question will be about crawl budget. Tell me what is crawl budget? Again, it goes beyond the scope of this class.
52:07
Keep all these words in mind. What is crawl budget? Or how to make robots.txt? What is htaccess?
52:13
There will be specific classes for all these. These are all very big topics. You won't be able to do it in this class. And you will get lost from Google Search Console.
52:20
Other than this, there are some types of Googlebot. Googlebot is not the only one. There are many types of Googlebot launched by Google.
52:28
And you get to know about all of them. But then again, this is also not something crucial. Which you need to see immediately.
52:34
You need to pay attention to the details. So with this, we have completed the crawl stats. There are still some important options in Google Search Console.
52:42
For example, there is user information. You have to talk about ownership verification. You have to see the change of address.
52:48
You have to talk about bulk data export. But there are many important things in Google Search Console.
52:55
Which we have to cover. But we will cover them in the next class. Where we will wrap Google Search Console. There are still some shopping and enhancement options in Google Search Console.
53:06
We will read the schema data later. After that, we will revisit it again. And we will wrap Google Search Console.
53:14
But till then, Google Search Console will end in the next class. And in this course, we will move towards some other tool.
53:21
We have to learn how to make a website. And we have to see the content. There are many questions and queries about the content.
53:29
How to make the content. And we have to cover all these things in specific classes. So in the next class, we will wrap Google Search Console.
53:35
And then we will come to the part of making a website. So see you in the next class. And note down all the doubts related to this class.
53:43
In the next doubt session, which will be on Sunday at 3 o'clock. Then you will have to ask me. Okay. So join the channel.
53:49
Get ready for the next live class. If you don't ask questions. Then you will not get the full benefit of this course.
53:56
There is a small misconception. Someone posts on LinkedIn. Someone messages. The course is not free.
54:02
Who is saying that the course is free? I have to spend time in making. I have to spend my time. I have to spend resources.
54:09
And you have to spend on learning. So where is it free? The thing for which you have to spend. It is not free.
54:15
So take full advantage of this course. See you in the next class. Where we will wrap Google Search Console. Till then keep learning.
54:21
Keep practicing. And keep attending all of the classes. Thank you so much. My name is Amit Tiwari from amittiwari.net. And I will see you next time.
54:27
Take care.


---


Hello everyone, I am Amit Tiwari for amittiwari.net and this is the next class of our advanced SEO course in which we will cover the last part of Google Search Console.
0:08
We will cover all the remaining topics of Google Search Console in today's class.
0:12
Apart from this, there will be an advanced class of Google Search Console which will be done after some time.
0:18
There are many such topics which we will have to leave in Google Search Console.
0:22
For example, we will not be able to cover all the topics related to schema data because we will have to read schema data first.
0:27
So, after some classes, maybe after a month, we will take one more advanced class of Google Search Console.
0:32
But for now, for beginner use, for beginner to intermediate use, Google Search Console will end after today's class.
0:39
After Google Search Console, the next topic which we will cover in this course will be making a website.
0:44
In this, purchasing the domain, connecting the domain with the hosting, purchasing the hosting and setting it up.
0:49
In this, different platforms like Wordpress, Shopify, Wix, all the different websites can be made in a common way.
0:59
Making all those websites, uploading different files in it, how you can optimize your hosting account for good performance, some security arrangements, we will talk about all these in the next one or two classes.
1:13
So, now let's start today's class.
1:15
But before that, a generic reminder that if you have missed any of our classes in this course, then pause this video, finish those classes first and then attend this class so that you can get the full benefit of this course.
1:31
And note down your questions and doubts so that you can ask me in the live session on Sunday.
1:37
Now let's go to the computer screen and start today's class.
1:43
So, in the last class, we covered both CrawlStats and Robots.txt.
1:47
Now, there are some important options here which are important to understand.
1:51
First of all, the important option that you can see is actually below the screen.
1:55
And it tells you when did you add this property in your account.
2:01
And how can you remove it?
2:03
By pressing this button called Remove Property.
2:05
And this property will be removed from your account.
2:09
By pressing this button called Remove Property.
2:11
And this property will be removed from your account.
2:13
This is also very important because a lot of times when you are working on your email ID, a lot of properties keep getting connected in your Google account.
2:20
People give you access.
2:21
A lot of times, a project is gone or it didn't come.
2:24
But those properties keep bogging up your account.
2:26
It makes your headache unnecessarily.
2:28
So, by using this button, we can remove the property.
2:30
Now, let's come to this screen first.
2:33
Here you can see Ownership Verification.
2:36
This means that if you have access to this website in your account, then what level of access do you have?
2:42
And how is that access obtained?
2:44
For example, I can see Delegated Owner here.
2:46
Delegated Owner means that some other verified owner who actually verified this website with his account has shared this email ID access with you.
3:01
You haven't verified it.
3:03
Just like we saw the process here that we come to a website like this and select a method between Domain Property and URL Prefix Property and verify the website.
3:14
We haven't verified it that way.
3:16
Someone else has made you an owner and that's why you can see the access of the Delegated Owner here.
3:22
Now, the second option is User and Permission.
3:25
Let me click here and see.
3:27
It will show us like this
3:29
that we got access, we got permission through some other owner.
3:33
If I want to become a verified owner, then I can complete this whole step here and then I can make this account a verified owner with this website.
3:47
So, instead of GoDaddy,
3:48
I will choose AnyDNS Provider and I am getting TXT information here.
3:51
So, if I have access to this domain wherever it has been registered,
3:56
I can log in and add this TXT record and verify this website in my account as a verified owner.
4:03
But, I don't need to do it now.
4:05
I will come back here and come to the User and Permission window.
4:09
Here, you will see a list of those people who can access this Google Search Console property of this domain right now.
4:20
So, here you can see my two email IDs.
4:22
One is a verified owner and one is a Delegated Owner
4:26
and I am using this account aimed at amitwari.net.
4:29
So, this is the list in front of you.
4:31
Here, if you want to remove a particular owner, you can click on this and then you can use the Remove Access button to remove this owner.
4:39
I can't see the option here because I am using this account by logging in and recording this tutorial.
4:45
Here, you can see the Remove Access button with the other account.
4:49
I can click on this and change it.
4:51
Now, here you can see another option
4:53
Ownership Verification Detail.
4:55
Here, you can see another option
4:56
Change Permission.
4:57
But, this is greyed out because this user is already a verified owner.
5:00
I can't change his permission.
5:02
If I click on Ownership Verification Detail,
5:04
I can see the method here by which this particular email ID has verified this website in its Google Search Console account.
5:12
So, this is an informational thing.
5:14
Apart from this, there are two other very useful options here.
5:17
These are security-related options.
5:19
Number one is Ownership History.
5:21
If I click on this,
5:22
I can see here with which email ID or which account this website has been accessed.
5:30
On which date it has been accessed and on which date it has been removed.
5:34
All this information can be found here in this list.
5:37
Which is a very useful thing because if you have given access to a vendor with your website or a client has given access to you and the client is not sure when a particular user has removed a particular user or if there is any dispute like this, then
5:53
from this Ownership History tab, all these details can be seen.
5:57
So, here you can see that whenever this website was added for the first time in Google Search Console, what changes have been made since then, all that is available here as a list.
6:07
In fact, since March 2018, this Google Search Console property started becoming active and since then you can see the verification failed messages.
6:18
There is a lot of information here.
6:20
This is one way that shows the entire birth chart of Google Search Console.
6:25
So, there can be no dispute that a particular user added a particular user or not.
6:30
A little bit of account.
6:33
The second option is
6:34
Unused Ownership Token.
6:36
So, let's say that there is an owner here.
6:40
This owner used a particular method and this particular email ID used this verification method and linked this property in Google Search Console.
6:49
Let's remove this user from here.
6:52
Let's remove its access.
6:53
But you didn't remove this verification method, this token.
6:58
So, what will the user do?
6:59
It will go back to Google Search Console.
7:01
It will simply go like this.
7:02
And then it will try to add the link of this website again.
7:06
Google will automatically verify it again.
7:08
Why will it do that?
7:09
Because the verification method is still pending there.
7:15
And whenever we work in a website for a long time, we remove the user's access.
7:21
But we don't remember its verification method.
7:23
And in such scenarios, the old owners or managers gain access again and can harm your website.
7:31
How can they harm?
7:32
Well, they can use the removal tool and de-index your homepage.
7:36
They can remove it completely.
7:38
So, what will they do?
7:39
Right? That's why it is important to keep the access of Google Search Console very tight and secure.
7:44
So, here, we can see a button called
7:47
Unused Ownership Token.
7:48
Here, we can see the number 1.
7:50
This means that there is a token which is active somewhere and using it, another email ID can gain access to this
7:59
Google Search Console property again.
8:02
Let's click on it.
8:03
And here, we get to know what kind of token it is.
8:05
This is a Domain Name Provider token.
8:07
That means, the domain name provider where the domain was registered, there is a token which this particular email ID had added.
8:18
So, if this email ID info at nidastreet.ca goes back to Google Search Console and wants to add the URL of this website, they can gain access to this property again.
8:30
So, what is the way to remove it?
8:32
It's not like you have to go to the Domain Name Register Account and then after going there, you have to remove it.
8:38
No.
8:39
There is no need to do all this.
8:40
Just click on the Remove button.
8:42
As soon as you click on the Remove button,
8:44
Google will automatically remove this particular token from your website.
8:52
Now, this code may be there in the Domain Name Records, but it cannot be used in the verification of this website.
9:00
So, you have to go to your website and see how many unused tokens you have and click on the Remove button to secure the Search Console of the website.
9:10
Search Console is not just a way to see the information.
9:14
It can also mess up the indexing of your website.
9:16
You can simply remove the URLs of your site which will affect the ranking.
9:22
You can use the Remover Tool to completely destroy the website.
9:26
That's why, it is very important to see and verify the information of this unused token and then remove all the unused users and all the unused tokens.
9:36
No matter how many good terms have been removed, clients should always remove the email IDs and tokens of the vendors.
9:46
Vendors should also remove the websites of their clients from the Search Console.
9:52
Although, we all know that
9:54
SEOs keep the old websites with them so that we can see them later. Is the website progressing or is it actually decreasing?
10:04
It gets a little satisfaction by seeing it go down.
10:06
Guilty pleasure for all of us.
10:08
Anyway, these are the two options.
10:10
After this, the third option is Ad User.
10:12
That is, if you share the access of Google Search Console property to a new user, then how to do it?
10:17
Here, click on the Add User button.
10:19
And then after this, we will have to add the email id.
10:22
Let's say students at amitawari.net.
10:24
And then after this, in the permission, you can see Full Owner Restricted.
10:28
Restricted means that it can see a little bit of information.
10:31
Full means that it can see all the information.
10:35
And Owner means that it can add other managers, other full or restricted members.
10:44
There are three.
10:45
What is the difference between Restricted and Full?
10:47
I have never noticed it till date.
10:49
Restricted, I don't know.
10:51
And for the sake of this tutorial, I will not go and see it yet.
10:54
Basically, we always share and ask for full access.
10:57
Some people don't give owner access.
10:59
Even if you don't give, it will work.
11:00
You get all the information in full.
11:01
You just can't add a user.
11:03
So if you want to take permission or you want to provide to someone else, then you take the full access level.
11:09
Minimum to minimum.
11:10
What is the benefit of Restricted?
11:11
By the way, there are many different agencies here, which use different processes.
11:15
Many people will take the vendor's email id and provide access to it.
11:19
Many companies are such that they make their own email id, by doing analytics or monitor or status or project something.
11:26
They share access on that.
11:27
Then they provide access to the vendor on that email id.
11:30
So all these are their own ways.
11:31
Let's remove it here.
11:32
And then we come back to the settings section.
11:35
And here our user information is complete.
11:38
After this comes Association.
11:40
Association basically tells you that this Search Console property has an association with different Google properties or not.
11:49
For example, this Google Search Console property is connected to a YouTube channel and Google Analytics.
11:55
You will not get the option to connect from here.
11:57
You just have to accept it.
11:59
Google Search Console does not connect to any other property.
12:01
But other properties can connect to the Google Search Console property.
12:05
Whenever you receive such a request, you will see it here and you have to accept it.
12:10
Now, if you are asking how to get access from other properties here, when we come to those tools, when we take the Google Analytics class, we will see how you can connect the Google Search Console property to Google Analytics.
12:24
This is not useful for us now.
12:25
This is still out of the scope of today's class.
12:28
The third option that comes here is Change of Address.
12:31
Change of Address means that when you are moving a website from one domain to another domain, then you can inform Google that look, our website is moving from this domain to another domain.
12:45
Send our traffic from here to there.
12:48
You can do this without telling Google.
12:51
But the benefit of telling is that
12:53
Google is still giving the same rank as it was giving to your old domain.
12:59
For your keywords, for your target audience, it will have to be given to your new website.
13:04
The new website will get a jump start.
13:06
It will not have to start from ground zero.
13:09
Okay.
13:10
Now, you can see two steps here.
13:12
Setup and Update Google.
13:14
Okay.
13:15
So, first of all, I will explain the setup.
13:19
How you have to prepare your new website so that you can actually use this Change of Address option.
13:25
Let's say you have a website.
13:28
The name of the website is
13:32
old.com.
13:34
Okay.
13:35
There can be a lot of pages on this old.com website.
13:38
For example, old.com slash about dash us.
13:43
old.com slash product slash best dash product.
13:49
old.com slash blog slash best blog page.
13:58
old.com slash testimonial slash john dash doe.
14:06
There are a lot of URLs like this on your website, on old.com.
14:10
So now, you create a new website, which is new.com.
14:13
Now, because you are transferring on Google Search Console, you are changing the address.
14:17
You are not changing the website.
14:19
You are not changing the content.
14:21
If you are changing the content, you are changing the design, you are changing everything, then this process cannot be done on Google Search Console.
14:26
This is only possible when you are changing the domain of the website.
14:30
Okay.
14:31
You can change the design.
14:32
There is no problem in changing the design.
14:33
But the content should be the same.
14:34
The structure should be the same.
14:36
For example, the URL of our test website is nidastreet.ca.
14:41
Let's say, tomorrow he wants to go international.
14:43
He wants to create his domain, nidastreet.com.
14:45
So, in such cases, this process can be used.
14:48
So now, you have to create all the pages on this new.com.
14:52
And everyone's URL structure should be the same.
14:54
That is, new.com slash about dash us page will be there.
14:59
New.com slash product slash best dash product page will be there.
15:06
New.com slash blog slash best dash blog dash page will also be there.
15:14
And new.com slash testimonial slash john dash do will also be there.
15:22
Okay.
15:23
So, now both these websites are the same.
15:25
One is old.
15:26
One is new.
15:27
But both have the same URL structure.
15:31
Now, these two websites can be switched between each other.
15:35
So, when you are ready to switch these websites between each other, both have the same URL structure, then you will have to apply a whole domain-wide redirect.
15:45
That is, whenever someone wants to visit any page of old.com, they should be sent to new.com with 301 redirect.
15:54
If someone wants to visit old.com slash about us, then the browser should automatically send them to new.com slash about us.
16:01
If someone wants to visit old.com slash testimonial slash john do, then they should be sent to new.com slash testimonial slash john do.
16:10
A whole domain-wide redirect should be set up like this.
16:13
It is very easy to set up a redirect like this.
16:16
It is done with the htaccess file.
16:17
We will be able to read this in the next class.
16:19
So, there is no need to worry.
16:21
Once you have placed the redirect, then you have to come to the Google Search Console.
16:25
You have to link your new.com domain to the Google Search Console in which nidhasstreet.ca property is connected.
16:37
Both websites will be live.
16:38
Both websites are connected to the same Google Search Console.
16:41
Now, you will see the domain name in the list like this.
16:46
You will select it.
16:47
I am selecting a test domain here because I want to show you this process.
16:50
I will click on the Validate and Update button.
16:52
Google will check for a while and give you a notice like this.
16:57
If the home page to home page is not redirected, then this process will fail.
17:02
Then it will not let you move forward.
17:04
Because the home page is not redirecting, then Google will not let you do it.
17:08
If your home page is redirecting, the pages are also redirecting to each other.
17:13
If the home page is not redirecting, then you will see this error in which you cannot do it.
17:17
Apart from this, Google will check some of your pages.
17:20
If those pages are not matching 100% and are not redirecting 100%, then you will see this warning like this.
17:28
This is an error and this is a warning.
17:30
The home page to home page should be redirected.
17:32
The rest of the pages are recommended to each other.
17:35
Now, pay attention here.
17:36
I have told you a while ago that the page to page redirection should be done.
17:41
Because Google is not saying that the page to page should be redirected.
17:45
It only wants the home page.
17:46
But you have to see the traffic of your website.
17:48
This is where the difference between SEO and Google's recommendation starts.
17:53
Google will tell you what is overall okay for it.
17:57
If your home page to home page is redirecting, you press the button here.
18:00
Then there is no problem for Google.
18:02
But your traffic will die.
18:04
The website will kill you.
18:05
Neither here nor there.
18:07
Both went into a dilemma.
18:08
Maya did not get Ram.
18:09
That situation will happen.
18:10
Okay.
18:11
So we have to set the page to page redirect.
18:14
It is our duty to set the page to page redirect.
18:17
It is an old page.
18:18
Old URL on new URL.
18:20
Redirect on the same URL.
18:22
Only then your traffic will be saved.
18:23
People ask a lot that after website migration, my traffic is over.
18:26
These are the mistakes that start the whole problem.
18:30
So if all the pages are being redirected one to one, then there will be no error here.
18:34
Three green ticks will be visible.
18:35
Here you have to click on the proceed button.
18:38
And this redirection will start.
18:42
Now when you start redirection, then this process is in probation for 180 days.
18:48
That is, in 180 days, in 6 months, at any time, you will press the cancel button.
18:53
And Google will stop the traffic of the new website.
18:56
It will start sending people to the old website again.
18:59
180 days, 6 months.
19:01
That's how long Google thinks.
19:03
And people expect us to rank within a month.
19:06
Right? This is the process.
19:08
It takes a little time.
19:10
It takes a little time.
19:11
So this was the change of address process, in which you redirect the traffic of the old website to the new website after migration, after coming to the Google Search Console.
19:20
After this, one more option that is visible here is bulk data export.
19:25
That is, you export the data of the Google Search Console, save it in Google's BigQuery server.
19:32
BigQuery is a very large Excel sheet platform, where all the data you see in the Google Search Console, will be saved in Google's BigQuery engine.
19:44
There is only one loss and one benefit of doing this.
19:48
Let me tell you the loss first.
19:50
It's a paid service.
19:51
It's not free.
19:52
So you will have to give the project ID, data set name here.
19:55
You will have to select the location of the data center.
19:58
And then after this, you will press the continue button.
20:00
click on it and your Google Search Console data will be collected and sent to BigQuery every day.
20:06
But this will be a paid service. You will have to pay a charge of around $20 to $40.
20:12
And on BigQuery, you don't just have to save data.
20:16
The more times you extract data from BigQuery, the more you have to pay.
20:25
So, these are two things to keep in mind.
20:27
The advantage of BigQuery is that you get pure data.
20:32
Google Search Console always has sample data.
20:36
For example, whenever we see an indexing report, we try to extract the URL.
20:42
All this data is limited to 1000 rows.
20:45
You have all the data in BigQuery.
20:47
You have your own server.
20:48
You are paying for it. Google Search Console is not paying for it.
20:51
So, you can extract as many URLs as you want from there.
20:55
And this data is forever. Google Search Console doesn't keep more than 16 months of data.
21:00
Bing Webmaster Tool is good in this regard. It has started giving data for 24 months from last month.
21:05
But Google Search Console deletes the data after 16 months.
21:08
But that data is forever in BigQuery.
21:10
You can export that data.
21:12
You can use it on any other platform.
21:14
These days, in the age of AI, you can use it for modeling.
21:17
You can run different analyses.
21:19
You can troubleshoot a problem.
21:21
You can find new opportunities.
21:22
You can generate content ideas.
21:24
A lot of things are possible.
21:26
So, overall, it's a very good option.
21:28
But it's not for every business.
21:30
If your website is small and you are running a blog, then it's fine.
21:33
There is no problem.
21:34
If it's an e-commerce website, news website, or a big website, then you can do it.
21:38
I have shown the whole process of connecting with BigQuery in this video.
21:42
You can see it in the top right corner.
21:44
There is a link to it in the description.
21:46
You can click on it and see it there.
21:47
But it is not for every student.
21:49
So, we will not explain it in this class again.
21:52
I have explained it in that video.
21:54
You can use it there.
21:55
So, with this, our Google Search Console class is over.
22:00
If you have any specific question, note it down.
22:05
There will be a class on Sunday at 3 p.m.
22:07
You can ask it there.
22:08
There are some options left.
22:11
There is an enhancement section.
22:13
There is a shopping section.
22:14
There is a lot left.
22:15
We will see it later when we read the schema data.
22:18
See you in the next class.
22:20
We will come to the topic of making a website.
22:23
We will do some action.
22:24
We will start with WordPress.
22:25
We will see Shopify.
22:26
We will see Wix.
22:27
We will see all the major platforms where people make their websites.
22:32
Don't have any doubt that WordPress is small.
22:35
You can use WordPress for small business.
22:37
It's not good.
22:38
It's not boring.
22:39
It's like Windows.
22:40
The smaller the hardware you give, the worse Windows will run.
22:43
If you give good hardware, Windows will run very well.
22:45
Okay.
22:46
See you in the next class.
22:47
Keep learning.
22:48
Keep practicing.
22:49
Attend all the classes.
22:50
Note the question with you.
22:52
Attend the doubt-solving class.
22:54
You will not only learn from your questions there.
22:57
If you don't have a doubt, join the class.
23:01
You will get a chance to learn from the questions of other students.
23:05
Many students are coming.
23:07
They ask very good questions.
23:08
See you in the live doubt session.
23:10
Keep learning.
23:11
Keep practicing.
23:12
Thank you so much for watching this video and attending this class.
23:13
My name is Amit Tiwari from amittiwari.net.
23:15
I will see you next time.
23:16
Take care.

हेलो एवरीवन, आई एम अमित तिवारी फ्रॉम अमित तिवारी नेट और यह है एडवांस एसइओ क्लास की नेक्स्ट क्लास जिसमें हम एक बेहद
0:06
इंपॉर्टेंट एंड फाउंडेशनल टॉपिक को टच करने जा रहे हैं। आज हम बात करेंगे कीवर्ड रिसर्च की। कीवर्ड रिसर्च आपके एसइओ
0:13
कैंपेन की शुरुआत होती है। हमने अभी तक वेबसाइट के ऑप्टिमाइजेशन पर बात कर ली। हमने रैंकिंग सिग्नल्स के बारे में बात कर
0:18
ली और ये सारे के सारे जो एस्पेक्ट्स हैं वो बहुत इंपॉर्टेंट हैं। लेकिन जब आप किसी वेबसाइट का एसइओ कैंपेन एक्चुअली में करने
0:26
जाते हैं तो जो पहला टास्क हम करते हैं वो होता है कीवर्ड रिसर्च। इनफैक्ट कीवर्ड रिसर्च कीेंस इतनी ज़्यादा है कि
0:33
एग्जीक्यूशन से पहले प्लानिंग के फेस पर इवन कॉन्ट्रैक्ट डिस्कशन के टाइम पर भी कई बार अभी भी क्लाइंट्स पूछ लेते हैं कि आप
0:39
इस प्रोजेक्ट के अंदर इस कैंपेन के अंदर इस बजट में कितने कीवर्ड्स को टारगेट करने जा रहे हैं। ऑलदो अब ये आउटडेटेड कांसेप्ट
0:45
है लेकिन फिर भी ये बताता है कि कीवर्ड रिसर्च कितना इंपॉर्टेंट है। तो आज की क्लास में हम कीवर्ड रिसर्च को जानेंगे।
0:52
कीवर्ड रिसर्च को समझेंगे और कीवर्ड रिसर्च को करके देखेंगे कि आखिर हम अपने एसइओ कैंपेन की एग्जीक्यूशनल शुरुआत कैसे
0:58
करें। बट कीवर्ड रिसर्च की इस क्लास को अटेंड करने से पहले मेक श्योर कि आपने अभी तक इस कोर्स की सारी क्लासेस अटेंड कर ली
1:05
है। उन्हें समझ लिया है। अपने डाउट्स को क्लियर कर लिया है। बिकॉज़ अगर आप किसी भी क्लास को मिस कर चुके हैं तो फिर आप इस
1:10
क्लास का पूरा फायदा नहीं उठा पाएंगे। जो लोग यह सोच रहे हैं कि मुझे Google रैंकिंग सिग्नल सीखने की जरूरत नहीं है।
1:16
मुझे वर्डप्रेस के ऑप्टिमेशन की जरूरत नहीं है। या फिर मुझे शॉप के बारे में जान के क्या करना है? वेल, यू डोंट नो कि आप
1:21
क्या मिस कर रहे हैं। 1 घंटे डेढ़ घंटे की क्लास में हम कितनी छोटी-छोटी चीजों को जो शायद उस टॉपिक से रिलेटेड नहीं है लेकिन
1:28
बहुत इंपॉर्टेंट है आपकी एसइओ जर्नी से रिलेटेड। उन्हें हम डिस्कस करते हैं। उन्हें हम एक्सप्लेन करते हैं। उनके बारे
1:33
में जानते हैं। सो आप जो भी क्लास मिस करेंगे आप अपनी लर्निंग को ही हर्ट करने वाले हैं। सो प्लीज मेक श्योर कि आपने
1:39
इससे पहले की सारी क्लासेस अच्छे से अटेंड कर ली, समझ ली है। एंड देन इसके बाद आप इस क्लास को शुरू करें।
1:47
[संगीत]
1:54
सो सबसे पहला बेसिक क्वेश्चन आता है कि आखिर कीवर्ड है क्या? लेट्स से कि मैं एक
2:00
डेंटल क्लीनिक ढूंढ रहा हूं। सो मैं यहां पर सर्च करता हूं डेंटल क्लीनिक।
2:06
सर्च किया। यहां पर डेंटल क्लीनिक को सर्च कर रहा हूं और मुझे यहां पर रिजल्ट दिखाई दे रहे हैं। नाउ क्या ये मेरा कीवर्ड है?
2:13
नॉर्मली स्टूडेंट्स यह आंसर करते हैं कि जो भी यूजर सर्च कर रहा है Google पर वो हमारा कीवर्ड है। नहीं है वो कीवर्ड
2:20
हमारा। यूजर जब Google पर कुछ भी सर्च करता है तो जो भी वर्ड टाइप कर रहा है डेंटल क्लनिक यहां पर मैंने टाइप किया है।
2:26
ये है क्वेरी। ये कीवर्ड नहीं है। हम आ जाते हैं जरा सा अपने माइंड मैपिंग टूल
2:31
पर। और यहां पर हम इस वर्ड के साथ में एक और वर्ड लिखते हैं जो है हमारी क्वेरी।
2:37
क्वेरी और कीवर्ड में डिफरेंस क्या है? कीवर्ड इज डिसाइडेड बाय यू। ओके? यह
2:42
डिसाइडेड बाय यू है। क्वेरी इज डिसाइडेड बाय सर्चर।
2:49
जो भी कोई पर्सन सर्च कर रहा है, वो अपनी मर्जी से कुछ भी कर सकता है। राइट? कीवर्ड
2:55
इज़ यूज्ड टू क्रिएट कंटेंट। क्वेरी इज़
3:03
यूज्ड टू क्रिएट आंसर और सर्व रिजल्ट्स पेज। एसईआरपी पहली
3:10
क्लास में हम लोगों ने बात की थी सर्च इंजन रिजल्ट्स पेजेस सर तो क्वेरी वो है
3:16
जो यूजर कर रहा है। कीवर्ड वो है जो आप टारगेट कर रहे हैं। सो फिर हम क्वेरी को रिसर्च क्यों नहीं कर रहे हैं? हम कीवर्ड
3:21
को क्यों रिसर्च कर रहे हैं? और इन दोनों के बीच में रिलेशन क्या हो सकता है? लेट्स से कि आप एक डेंटल क्लीनिक की वेबसाइट के
3:27
ऊपर काम कर रहे हैं और आपने एक्चुअल में जो यूज़ किया है कीवर्ड वो है डेंटल
3:33
क्लीनिक। ओके? नाउ हम आ जाते हैं Google के ऊपर। और यहां पर हमने डेंटल क्लीनिक जब टाइप
3:39
किया तो Google हमें कुछ सजेशंस दे रहा है। बट इनके ऊपर अभी थोड़ी देर में आते हैं। लेट्स से कि कोई डेंटल क्लीनिक नहीं
3:45
सर्च करता है। हर कोई डेंटल क्लीनिक नहीं सर्च कर सकता है। लेट्स से किसी ने सर्च किया डेंटिस्ट।
3:51
ओके? हो सकता है कोई सर्च करे डेंटिस्ट नियर मी। हो सकता है कोई सर्च करे बेस्ट
3:57
डेंटिस्ट फॉर किड्स। या कोई सर्च कर सकता है डेंटिस्ट
4:04
इन दिल्ली या मे बी अपने पास के एरिया का नाम लिख सकता है करोलबाग
4:09
दिल्ली हो सकता है कोई सर्च करे डेंटल सर्जन इन दिल्ली
4:16
नियर मी एट नाइट
4:21
इमरजेंसी डेंटल क्लीनिक कुछ भी सर्च कर सकता है
4:28
यूजर वो उसकी जरूरत के ऊपर डिपेंड करता है। अब लेट्स से कि अगर आपने यूज़ किया है
4:33
कीवर्ड डेंटल क्लीनिक अपने कंटेंट को लिखने में, अपने एसइओ स्ट्रेटजी को डेवलप
4:39
करने में तो क्या अगर कोई यूज़ करता है सर्च डेंटल सर्जन तो क्या आप नहीं रैंक
4:45
होना चाहते हैं? अगर कोई बेस्ट डेंटिस्ट सर्च कर रहा है तो क्या आप नहीं रैंक होना चाहते हैं? अगर यूजर सर्च कर रहा है बेस्ट
4:50
डेंटल क्लीनिक तो क्या आप नहीं चाहते हैं कि आपकी वेबसाइट वहां पर दिखाई दे? ऑब्वियसली आपको कैसे पता लगेगा कि यूजर इन
4:56
अलग-अलग वर्ड्स को यूज करके भी सर्च कर सकता है आपके बिजनेस के बारे में या यूजली नॉर्मली Google पर सर्च कर सकता है इन
5:02
सारे अलग-अलग वर्ड्स को यूज़ करके आप नहीं जान सकते हैं। आप हो सकता है कुछ क्वेरीज के लिए कुछ अलग-अलग फ्रेजेस के लिए आप
5:09
आईडिया लगा लें। आप गेस कर लें। लेकिन यूजर किस तरीके से ढूंढेगा? किस वर्ड को यूज़ करेगा वो आप कभी नहीं समझ पाएंगे। हो
5:17
सकता है कुछ लोग स्पेलिंग मिस्टेक करें। हो सकता है कुछ लोग हिंदी में सर्च करें। कुछ लोग मराठी में सर्च कर रहे हैं, कुछ कन्नाडा में सर्च कर रहे हैं। किसी भी
5:23
लैंग्वेज में अलग-अलग सर्च करें। आप चाहते हो अल्टीमेटली कि आपका बिजनेस वहां पर रैंक करे। अगर आप महाराष्ट्र में मुंबई
5:30
में अपना क्लनिक रन कर रहे हैं डेंटल क्लीनिक और अगर कोई मराठी में सर्च करता है तो भी आप उसको सर्विस प्रोवाइड कर सकते
5:35
हैं। इनफैक्ट अगर कोई मुंबई घूमने आया हुआ है, अगर कोई फ्रेंच बंदा आया है, अगर वो फ्रेंच में ही सर्च कर रहा है, तो भी आप
5:41
चाहते हो कि मेरा बिज़नेस आके दिखाई दे। सो लैंग्वेज आपके लिए मैटर नहीं करती है। वर्ड आपके लिए मैटर नहीं करता। सिनोनिम
5:47
मैटर नहीं करता है। स्पेलिंग मिस्टेक मैटर नहीं करती है। व्हाट मैटर्स फॉर यू इज़ कि आपको राइट यूजर जो जो पर्टिकुलर पर्सन जो
5:55
आपके बिनेस से रिलेटेड किसी भी वर्ड को सर्च कर रहा है वो आपके बिज़नेस को देख पाए। ओके? इसीलिए कीवर्ड रिसर्च
6:03
इंपॉर्टेंट हो जाता है। क्योंकि जब हम प्रॉपर कीवर्ड रिसर्च करते हैं तो हमें कुछ खास बेनिफिट होते हैं। नंबर एक हमें
6:09
मिलती है सही ऑडियंस। ओके? कई बार बहुत सारे लोगों को एक क्वेरी होती है कि यार हमारी वेबसाइट पर ट्रैफिक तो बहुत आता है
6:16
लेकिन ये फालतू का ट्रैफिक है। उससे हमें कोई बेनिफिट नहीं मिल रहा है। वो परचेस नहीं करते हैं। मेरी वेबसाइट पर क्लिक्स
6:22
बहुत आ रहे हैं। बहुत लोग आ रहे हैं। मेरी वेबसाइट पर विजिट कर रहे हैं। लेकिन कोई भी फॉर्म नहीं फील कर रहा है। कोई भी प्रोडक्ट परचेस नहीं कर रहा है। ऐसा इसलिए
6:28
नहीं हो रहा है कि आपके प्रोडक्ट के में कोई प्रॉब्लम है। यह पॉसिबल है कि हो सकता है आपके प्राइसेस थोड़े से अप हो, ज्यादा
6:35
हो। लेकिन मोस्ट ऑफ द टाइम प्रॉब्लम ये होती है कि आप सही टाइप की ऑडियंस को अट्रैक्ट नहीं कर रहे हैं। अगर आप सही
6:41
ऑडियंस को अट्रैक्ट नहीं करेंगे तो कैसे काम चलेगा? एक पुरानी कहावत है कि अगर आप गंजों के मोहल्ले में कंघी बेचने जाएंगे
6:49
तो आपका बिज़नेस कैसे होगा? ओके? सो करेक्ट ऑडियंस आपको मिलती है। आपको मोर ऑडियंस
6:56
मिलती है। बिकॉज़ आप अलग-अलग टाइप के क्वेरीज़ के लिए आप सही से अपीयर हो रहे
7:02
हैं और आपको बिज़नेस अच्छा मिलता है। ओके? एंड
7:07
बेटर ब्रांड मार्केटिंग। आप के कीवर्ड्स के लिए जब भी कोई सर्च कर
7:13
रहा है बार-बार आपका बिजनेस अपीयर हो रहा है। जब भी कोई डेंटल प्रॉब्लम के बारे में किसी भी तरह की डेंटल प्रॉब्लम के बारे में सर्च करता है। आपकी वेबसाइट का ही
7:19
यूआरएल दिखाई देता है। आपको ऑटोमेटिकली लगता है कि भाई ये वेबसाइट ये पर्टिकुलर डेंटल क्लनिक अपने आप में बहुत अच्छा है।
7:26
अभी हम सारे एसइओस जानते हैं कि Redit को Google कितना ज्यादा भर-भर के ट्रैफिक दे रहा है। Redit को पैसे भी दे रहा है। सारी
7:31
चीजें डिस्कस हो रही है। लेकिन क्या आपने नोटिस किया है कि RedIT पर जितने लोग जाकर अपने कमेंट्स करते हैं, अपनी इनेशन को
7:37
शेयर करते हैं, एक्सपीरियसेस को शेयर करते हैं। उससे रेट की वैल्यू कितनी ज्यादा बढ़ गई है। ये वो बढ़ी हुई वैल्यू ही है। और
7:43
ये जो अलग-अलग तरीके से लोग रेडिट को के ऊपर जाकर अपनी प्रॉब्लम्स को सर्च करते रहते हैं। इस वजह से ही Google फोर्स हुआ
7:49
है रेड के कंटेंट को यूज़ करने के लिए। वो कंटेंट यूज़फुल है। इसीलिए रेट को पेमेंट कर रहा है Google रेडिट को ज्यादा
7:55
प्रॉमिनेंटली दिखा रहा है। बिकॉज़ अगर आप नहीं चाहते हो कि आप किसी यूज़लेस ब्लॉग से कोई इनेशन लो तो आप रेट को अपेंड करते हो
8:02
ना साथ में। हम सब ऐसा करते हैं। तो अगर कीवर्ड रिसर्च प्रॉपर तरीके से आपने किया हुआ है तो आपको सही टाइप की ऑडियंस मिलती
8:09
है अपनी वेबसाइट पर। आपको ज्यादा ऑडियंस मिलती है और साथ ही में आपके ब्रांड की
8:14
वैल्यू भी इनक्रीस हो जाती है। सो कीवर्ड रिसर्च हमारे एसइओ कैंपेनस के लिए बहुत जरूरी होता है और ये पहला स्टेप भी होता
8:20
है। लेकिन इस पहले स्टेप के साथ में एक प्रॉब्लम हो जाती है। आप में से जितने भी
8:26
एक्सपीरियंस्ड एसइओस हैं जो लोग ऑलरेडी एसइओ कैंपेन कर रहे हैं, रन कर रहे हैं, जॉब कर रहे हैं, बिनेस कर रहे हैं, वो जरा
8:33
अपने आप से सोच के देखें कि जब भी आप कीवर्ड रिसर्च कर लेते हो, उसके बाद आप क्या करते हो? कंटेंट लिखते हो ना उसके
8:39
ऊपर और कंटेंट में भी कंटेंट हटा देता हूं। आप लिखते हो ब्लॉग। आपने कीवर्ड
8:45
रिसर्च किया और आपने ब्लॉग लिख लिया उस कीवर्ड के ऊपर। यही करते हैं ना हम लोग। हम बीच में एक एक स्टेप कंप्लीटली मिस कर
8:52
रहे हैं और इस स्टेप को गलत तरीके से लिख रहे हैं। कीवर्ड रिसर्च, ब्लॉग राइटिंग। मैंने इतने
8:57
इंटरव्यूज लिए हैं। इतने सारे स्टूडेंट से बात की हुई है। हमेशा हर एक पर्सन यही रहता है। कीवर्ड रिसर्च किया और हमने
9:03
ब्लॉग राइटिंग चालू कर दी। राइटर को भेज दिया। राइटर ने ब्लॉग लिख दिया। अगर कोई बहुत ज्यादा एक्सपीरियंस है, अच्छी कंपनी
9:09
में काम कर रहा है तो कहता है कि हम ब्लॉग के ना पॉइंटर्स बना के दे देते हैं। क्या H2, H3 कितने होने हैं। इसके बाद आप आराम
9:15
से राइटर से लिखवा लेते हैं। यहां पर ही सबसे बड़ी गलती हो जाती है जो इस कीवर्ड रिसर्च कीेंस को खत्म कर देती है। नाउ ये
9:22
टॉपिक थोड़ा अगली क्लास से रिलेटेड है। लेकिन अभी बताना जरूरी है ताकि ऐसा ना हो कि अगली क्लास दो-तीन दिन में जब तक आए तब
9:28
तक आप में से कुछ लोग जल्दी से कीवर्ड रिसर्च करें और इसके बाद तुरंत ही जाकर ब्लॉग को लिख के बैठ जाएं। सो एक तो यहां
9:37
पर ब्लॉग राइटिंग नहीं होगी, कंटेंट राइटिंग होगी।
9:43
कीवर्ड रिसर्च के बाद एक और स्टेप है। उसके बाद कंटेंट राइटिंग होगी। लेकिन कीवर्ड रिसर्च और कंटेंट राइटिंग के बीच
9:50
में क्या आता है? कॉनेंट प्लानिंग। कीवर्ड रिसर्च आपने कर लिया। ओके? अच्छी
9:56
बात है। लेकिन अब कीवर्ड रिसर्च और कंटेंट लिखने के बीच में कंटेंट की प्लानिंग जरूरी है। क्या कंटेंट लिखना है मुझे? किस
10:04
टाइप का कंटेंट लिखना है। उसमें क्या होगा? उसमें क्या नहीं होगा? उसे कहां पर पोस्ट करना है? कहां पर पब्लिश करना है?
10:10
यह सारी चीजें हम लोग अगली क्लास में जानेंगे। सो आज आप कीवर्ड रिसर्च सीख
10:16
लेंगे। लेकिन इसका मतलब ये नहीं कि जाके ब्लॉग राइटिंग चालू कर देनी है। अगली क्लास का वेट करो। उसमें हम लोग कंटेंट
10:22
प्लानिंग के ऊपर बात करेंगे। जो मैं इस कोर्स की शुरुआत से एक वर्ड बार-बार रिपीट कर रहा हूं कि ब्लॉग राइटिंग नहीं करनी है
10:28
इस कोर्स के किसी भी स्टूडेंट को। अनलेस एंड अंटिल आप एक्चुअल में इनफेशनल ब्लॉग रन कर रहे हो। ब्लॉग राइटिंग नहीं करनी।
10:35
मैं बताऊंगा जब ब्लॉग आपको लिखना होगा। जिस टाइप का ब्लॉग लिखना होगा वो भी एक क्लास कर देंगे। लेकिन अभी अपनी वेबसाइट
10:41
के एसइओ कैंपेन को करने के लिए कोई ब्लॉग पोस्ट नहीं लिखेगा। और जो ब्लॉग पोस्ट लिखेगा वो क्वेश्चन नहीं पूछेगा कि मेरी
10:47
वेबसाइट रैंक नहीं हो रही है। ओके? सो हमने कीवर्ड रिसर्च अभी देखना है आज। आज की क्लास में एंड देन इसके बाद हम कंटेंट
10:53
प्लानिंग देखेंगे। ठीक है? ये अगली क्लास की प्लानिंग हमने ऑलरेडी कर ली है। सो, अब
10:58
हम आ जाते हैं कीवर्ड के ऊपर। थोड़ा सा इसे सेंटर में अलाइन कर लेते हैं। ठीक है? सो, हम कीवर्ड्स को दो अलग-अलग टाइप के
11:05
कीवर्ड्स में डिवाइड कर सकते हैं। एक हो गया स्मॉल कीवर्ड
11:11
और दूसरा हो गया नो पॉइंट्स फॉर गेसिंग। लॉन्ग कीवर्ड।
11:19
आई नो कुछ लोग थोड़े से डिसपॉइंट हो रहे होंगे कि यह किस टाइप का क्लासिफिकेशन है। है ना? स्मॉल कीवर्ड, लॉन्ग कीवर्ड यह कोई
11:26
क्लासिफिकेशन नहीं होता। यह तो लाइक है बेसिक। लेकिन इसके बीच का डिफरेंस मैं आपको अभी क्लियर कर देता हूं। लेट्स से
11:33
मैं यहां पर आता हूं और सर्च करता हूं कार। सिर्फ कार सर्च की है मैंने। अब यहां पर
11:39
क्या दिखाई दे रहा है? यहां पर दिखाई दे रहा है हमें कार वाले वेबसाइट दिखाई दे रही है। कार देखो दिखाई दे रही है। राइट?
11:45
एंड देन इसके बाद कार देखो एक और यूआरएल है। एंड देन इसके बाद कुछ Google लिस्टिंग्स दिखाई दे रही हैं। वीडियोस
11:50
दिखाई दे रहे हैं। इसके बाद अगेन सर्चेबलर्स दिखाई दे रहे हैं। कार विकीडिया पेज भी है। ओके? दूसरी सर्च हो सकती है बेस्ट कार। कार एक बहुत ही छोटा
11:59
कीवर्ड हो गया। राइट? अब हम देख रहे हैं बेस्ट कार। तो जब हमने बेस्ट कार देखना शुरू किया तो हमें पॉपुलर कार्स कार्स के
12:06
अपने ब्रांड्स दिखाई दे रहे हैं। मॉडल्स दिखाई दे रहे हैं। इसके बाद अगेन मुझे सर्च पेज यहां पर दिखाई देने शुरू हो गए।
12:12
एआई ओवरव्यू भी आ गया। चलो इमेजज़ भी आ गई, वीडियोस भी आ गया वगैरह-वगैरह। एक और सर्च कर लेता हूं। बेस्ट कार इन 10 लाख।
12:23
अब सर्च करते हैं क्या-क्या? अब यहां पर अगेन Google के सर्च दिखाई देना शुरू हो गए। एi ओवरव्यू दिखाई दे रहे हैं। इमेजज़
12:28
दिखाई दे रही हैं। वीडियोस दिखाई दे रही हैं वगैरह-वगैरह। अभी यहां पर कोई जो है वो एक तो स्क्रीनशॉट लेकर Twitter पर
12:34
डालेगा कि देखो ये एक नई चीज आई है। एआई ओवरव्यू में इमेजेस भी दिखाई देनी शुरू हो गई हैं। रिपोर्टिंग हर इंडस्ट्री में होनी
12:41
चाहिए। हर इंडस्ट्री के अपने रिपोर्टर्स होते हैं। लेकिन एसइओ इकलौती इंडस्ट्री है जहां पर नए फीचर्स को रिपोर्ट करने वालों
12:47
को भी एसइओ मान लिया जाता है। हमारी इकलौती यूनिक इंडस्ट्री जहां पर फीचर्स को रिपोर्ट करना भी आपको सब्जेक्ट मैटर
12:54
एक्सपर्ट बना देता है। ओके? एसइओ करने की जरूरत नहीं है। तुम सिर्फ सर्चेस उस पेज को दिन भर मॉनिटर करो। उसके चेंजेस को
13:00
निकाल निकाल के करो। आई स्टार्ट डाउटिंग मसेल्फ। मैं कुछ नया देखूंगा सोचूंगा अरे ये हो सकता है पहले से ही रहा हो। हमारा
13:06
काम रिपोर्ट करना नहीं है न्यूज़ को। हमारा काम है एक्चुअली में इसे यूज़ करना। इट्स गुड। कोई लोग रिपोर्ट कर रहे हैं बट
13:13
थोड़ी इंडस्ट्री वाइड प्रॉब्लम है। नाउ यहां पर बेस्ट कार इन 10 लाख आ गया। ये भी
13:18
अपने आप में एक क्वेरी है या मे बी यहां पर मैं टाइप कर सकता हूं बेस्ट कार इन 10 लाख फॉर ऑफ रोड यूज़ फॉर ऑफोडिंग हो गया।
13:27
ओके या फिर बेस्ट यूज्ड कार
13:32
बेस्ट यूज्ड कार इन 10 लाख फॉर ऑफोडिंग। तो रिजल्ट्स कॉन्स्टेंटली चेंज हो रहे हैं। मेरा जो ये क्वेरी है वो लंबी होती
13:38
जा रही है। नाउ हो सकता है अभी कुछ लोग को थोड़ा कंफ्यूजन हो कि अभी मैंने बोला था यह क्वेरी है। अब मैं कीवर्ड के एग्जांपल
13:43
में दे रहा हूं। इसलिए अभी दे रहा हूं बिकॉज़ ये मैं खुद से जानबूझकर सर्च कर रहा हूं। आई एम यूजिंग दिस एज कीवर्ड। तो मैं
13:49
अपने कीवर्ड को कार से लेकर बेस्ट यूज्ड कार इन 10 लाख फॉर ऑफोडिंग तक लेके आ गया
13:57
हूं। एक वर्ड था कार। उससे मैंने कितने बढ़ा लिए? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 आठ कीवर्ड तक
14:05
बढ़ गए। नाउ इससे फर्क क्या पड़ रहा है? कुछ समझ में आ रहा है आपको? जब मैं सर्च
14:10
कर रहा हूं कार सिर्फ यहां पर मैं कार सिर्फ अगेन सर्च करता हूं। अब आप यहां पर देखो कि ऊपर कार देखो कार वाले के यूआरएल
14:17
दिखाई दे रहे हैं। लेकिन इसके बाद यहां पर एक कार करके विकपीडिया का पेज भी है
14:23
जिसमें कार्स के बारे में इंफॉर्मेशन दी हुई है। नीचे एक ओलx का पेज भी है। यूज़ कार के लिए इनफार्मेशन दी। इस यूज़ कार
14:29
वाले के अंदर पेज के अंदर अगर हम जाकर देखें तो किसी भी स्पेसिफिक मॉडल के बारे में कोई इंफॉर्मेशन नहीं है। राइट? इसके
14:35
बाद नीचे और भी पेजेस दिखाई दे रहे हैं। न्यूज़ भी दिखाई दे रही है। जीएसटी के बारे में न्यूज़ है वगैरह-वगैरह। लेकिन
14:42
इसमें एक्चुअल में ईकॉम पर्पस के यूआरएल्स कम दिखाई दे रहे हैं। अगर मैं आ जाता हूं
14:48
बेस्ट यूज्ड कार इन 10 लाख फॉर ऑफोडिंग पर्पस से तो फिर यहां पर मुझे कार देखो का
14:53
दिखाई देता है यूआरएल जो यूज्ड कार के जो 10 लाख से नीचे दिल्ली के अंदर आपको कार्स
14:59
मिल सकती हैं। 951 कार्स रेडी है मेरे लिए परचेस करने के लिए वो दिखाई दे रहा है। स्पेसिफिक यूआरएल दिखाई दे रहा है। ठीक
15:06
है? इसके बाद यहां पर हेल्पफुल और थोड़ा सा कंटेंट आ गया कि लोग और इससे रिलेटेड क्या क्वेश्चंस पूछ सकते हैं। व्हाट इज द
15:12
बेस्ट यूज्ड ऑफ रोड व्हीकल? व्हिच कार इज बेस्ट इन 10 लाख ऑन रोड प्राइस? व्हिच कार
15:18
इज बेस्ट फॉर ऑफ रोड? ये जो रिलेटेड क्वेरीज हो सकती हैं वो दिखाई दे रही हैं। इसके बाद एक रेड की भी थ्रेड आ गई। जब हम
15:24
रेड की बात कर रहे थे। हेल्प मी पिक अ यूज्ड कार फॉर 10 लाख बजट।
15:29
किसी ने यह क्वेश्चन पूछा भी 7 महीने पहले कि 10 लाख के अंदर एक यूज्ड कार परचेस
15:35
करनी है। और यहां पर रेडिट है। ऑब्वियसली कार्स इंडिया एक अच्छी यूज़फुल सब्रेडिट है। इसके
15:42
अंदर लोगों ने जिन लोगों ने ऑलरेडी परचेस की होगी या जिनको नॉलेज ज्यादा होगी उनके व्यूज यहां पर दिखाई देंगे। राइट? उसके
15:48
नीचे कार वाले का ही एक यूआरएल दिखाई दे रहा है। कार देखो का यूआरएल है। कार 24 का यूआरएल है। Spin का है। Mahindra FS ये
15:56
सारी के सारी वो वेबसाइट्स हैं जो यूज़्ड कार बेचती हैं। करेक्ट? इन सभी यूज़्ड कार
16:01
वाली वेबसाइट्स को ही ट्रैफिक मिलेगा क्योंकि यूजर ने अपनी क्वेरी बड़ी स्पेसिफिक कर दी है। नाउ अगेन अगर हम
16:07
कार्स सर्च रिजल्ट्स पेज को देखें तो यहां पर कुछ वेबसाइट्स ऐसी हैं जो यूज़ कार वाले
16:12
पेजेस की तरफ लेके जा रही हैं। कुछ विकपीडिया पेज को दिखा रहे हैं। कुछ इनेशनल कंटेंट दिखा रहे हैं। कोई जीएसटी
16:18
के बारे में बात कर रहा है। स्पेसिफिक रिजल्ट नहीं है। यहां पर हमें जो रिजल्ट मिल रहे हैं वो स्पेसिफिक ही मिल रहे हैं।
16:24
सिर्फ ऐसे कीवर्ड्स, ऐसी वेबसाइट्स के रिजल्ट्स दिखाई दे रहे हैं जहां पर जाकर कोई यूज़ कार को परचेस कर सकता है। सो देख
16:32
लेते हैं कि लॉन्ग कीवर्ड और स्मॉल कीवर्ड के बीच में क्या डिफरेंस आता है। सबसे पहला डिफरेंस है कि जब हमारा कीवर्ड स्मॉल
16:38
होगा तो सर्च वॉल्यूम हाई होगा। क्योंकि कार्स को सर्च करने वाले लोग बहुत सारे हैं। अगर किसी को कार्स का फोटो चाहिए तो
16:44
भी वो कार सर्च करेगा। किसी को कार को ड्रॉ करना है, कार का कार्टून देखना है, कार का वीडियो देखना है, कार इन जनरल कुछ
16:51
भी सर्च करना है, वो कार सर्च कर सकता है। वॉल्यूम बहुत ज्यादा होगा। अगर लॉन्ग कीवर्ड है मेरा तो उसका जो वॉल्यूम होगा
16:59
वो कम होगा। ओके? लेस सर्च
17:04
वॉल्यूम। बट क्या ये बुरी बात है? अभी हमने देखा एग्जांपल में कि जब क्वेरी की
17:09
लेंथ बढ़ रही है, कीवर्ड की जब लेंथ बढ़ रही है, तो जो सर्च रिजल्ट्स पेज है ना वह भी हाइली टारगेटेड आ रहे हैं। यानी कि एक
17:17
पर्सन जिसने कार सिर्फ सर्च किया था, उससे हमें यह नहीं पता लग रहा कि उसको चाहिए क्या? लेकिन जब कोई सर्च कर रहा है बेस्ट
17:24
ऑफ रोड कार इन ₹1 लाख तो इसका मतलब है कि उसको पता है एग्जैक्टली उसे क्या चाहिए।
17:31
यानी कि क्लियर सर्चर। सर्चर कंफ्यूज नहीं है। सर्चर को पता है उसे एग्जैक्टली क्या
17:36
चाहिए। इस तरह के लोग हमारे लिए अच्छे हैं क्योंकि हो सकता है हमारे पास ट्रैफिक कम आएगा। लेकिन अगर यूजर को यह पता है कि वो
17:43
क्या सर्च कर रहा है तो वो उसी वेबसाइट पर क्लिक करेगा जिससे उसे प्रोडक्ट को परचेस करना है जिसे उसे सर्विस को अवेल करना है।
17:50
वो ऑलरेडी मोटिवेटेड है और ऐसे मोटिवेटेड सर्चर के वेबसाइट पर लैंड करने के बाद
17:55
एक्शन लेने के चांसेस बढ़ जाते हैं। सो हम यहां पर आ जाते हैं अगर तो हम यहां पर इस
18:01
यूएसपी ऐड कर सकते हैं स्मॉल कीवर्ड की अनक्लियर विल नॉट से अ कंफ्यूज बट
18:08
अनक्लियर सर्च। ठीक है? बट क्या स्मॉल कीवर्ड्स हमेशा खराब ही हैं? खराब नहीं
18:15
है। बिकॉज़ दे गिव यू मोर ब्रांडिंग या मोर ब्रांड विजिबिलिटी। बिकॉज़ अगर आप कार्स
18:21
नाम के नॉर्मल कीवर्ड के लिए अपीयर हो रहे हो जो एकदम जेनेरिक है जो बहुत छोटा सा
18:27
है। उसके लिए भी अगर आप अपीयर हो रहे हो तो बहुत सारे लोग आपकी वेबसाइट को देखेंगे। बहुत सारे लोग आपकी वेबसाइट के
18:34
नाम को जानेंगे। आपके लोगों को पहचानेंगे। आज हो सकता है कार्स कीवर्ड को सर्च करने
18:40
वाला सिर्फ और सिर्फ कार्स की फोटो को डाउनलोड करना चाहता है। कार का वॉलपेपर डाउनलोड करना चाहता है। लेकिन कल को वो
18:45
परचेस भी करेगा और उस टाइम पर उसे याद रहेगा कि हां देखो मैंने कार्स सर्च किया था तो मुझे वेबसाइट क्या दिखाई दे थी?
18:51
मुझे वेबसाइट दिखाई दी थी कार देखो। तो अगर मुझे दोबारा से जाना है कार्स के बारे
18:56
में सर्च करना है या कार्स के यूज़्ड कार को परचेस करना है तो मैं वापस कार्स देखो पर जाकर ही सर्च कर सकता हूं। तो ये जो
19:03
विज़िबिलिटी है ये कभी ना कभी तो काम आएगी ही आएगी। तो जहां हमें यहां पर क्लियर
19:08
सर्चर मिलता है, लेस वॉल्यूम मिलता है, हाई कन्वर्ज़ रेट मिलता है वहीं पर यहां पर हमको लेस ब्रांड विज़िबिलिटी मिलती है
19:15
लॉन्ग कीवर्ड्स के साथ में। अच्छा क्योंकि हम लिस्ट कर रहे हैं तो यहां पर लिख लेते हैं अ मोर हाई कन्वर्ज़ लिख लेते हैं।
19:23
और यहां पर जो कन्वर्ज़ रेट होगा वो होगा लो कन्वर्ज़ रेट।
19:30
ठीक है? स्मॉल कीवर्ड के अपने फायदे हैं। लॉन्ग कीवर्ड के अपने फायदे हैं। स्मॉल कीवर्ड के अपने नुकसान हैं। लॉन्ग कीवर्ड
19:36
के अपने नुकसान हैं। ठीक है? यहां पर हमें किस तरह के कीवर्ड को यूज़ करना चाहिए? अगर
19:42
आप लॉन्ग स्ट्रेटजी बना रहे हैं। अगर आपके पास बजट बहुत ज्यादा है, तो आप करेंगे
19:48
स्मॉल और लॉन्ग दोनों को यूज़ करेंगे। यूज़फुल फॉर लार्ज बजट कैंपेन।
19:56
ओके? अगर आपके पास बजट ही कम है, क्लाइंट को अगले महीने से रिजल्ट चाहिए, अगले हफ्ते से रैंकिंग पूछनी है, अगले महीने से
20:02
उसको रिजल्ट चाहिए, सेल चाहिए, तो यहां पर ये हैं यूज़फुल फॉर स्मॉल
20:08
एंड बजट एंड शॉर्ट कैंपेन।
20:14
ठीक है? यहां पर हम लिख देते हैं लार्ज बजट एंड लॉन्ग कैंपेन। बिकॉज़ कार्स जैसे छोटे
20:21
जेनेरिक कीवर्ड के लिए रैंक करने में टाइम लगेगा। बिकॉज़ आप बहुत अलग-अलग टाइप की
20:26
वेबसाइट्स के साथ में कमपीट कर रहे हैं। यहां पर हम एक बार वापस आ जाते हैं। जब हम कार्स को सर्च कर रहे हैं तो आपका कंपटीशन
20:32
में कार्स सेल करने वाली वेबसाइट्स भी हैं। ओके? एंड देन साथ में वीडियोस भी
20:38
हैं। उसके अलावा विकपीडिया भी है, ओएलx भी है, न्यूज़ वेबसाइट्स भी हैं। सो, अगर आपने कार्स देखो या कार्स वाले जैसी इंडस्ट्री
20:44
रिलेटेड वेबसाइट्स को बीट कर दिया, तो हो सकता है आप विकीडिया से ऊपर ना आ पाए। हो सकता है आप न्यूज़ वेबसाइट से ऊपर ना आए।
20:50
और यहां पर स्पेस भी तो कम हो रहा है। जितने ये अलग-अलग फीचर्स दिखाई दे रहे हैं उनकी वजह से जो ऑर्गेनिक वेबसाइट्स की जो
20:56
पोजीशन है वो भी दब रही है, नीचे आ रही है, कम हो रही है। तो अगर आपका जो कीवर्ड
21:02
है, टारगेट कीवर्ड है वो बहुत छोटा है तो फिर आप आइडियली काम नहीं कर पाएंगे। रैंक करने में आपको प्रॉब्लम होगी, टाइम लगेगा।
21:09
सो फिर आखिर आइडियल लेंथ क्या हो सकती है? किस तरह के कीवर्ड्स के ऊपर आप काम करें? जो हमने अभी तक एग्जांपल देखा जहां पर एक
21:17
तो कीवर्ड है कार्स और दूसरा है बेस्ट यूज्ड कार इन 10 लाख फॉर ऑफोडिंग। एक वर्ड
21:24
भी है हमारे पास और आठ वर्ड्स भी हैं। तो आपको कहां पर बैठना है? देखिए अगर हम अभी
21:30
तक के ट्रेंड के हिसाब से देखें तो हमारे पास जो एक आइडियल लेंथ आती है कीवर्ड्स की
21:35
वो है थ्री टू सिक्स वर्ड्स। शुरुआत के लिए। जब आप अपने करियर की
21:42
शुरुआत कर रहे हैं या फिर जब आप किसी भी वेबसाइट का नई वेबसाइट का एसइओ करने जा
21:47
रहे हैं तो हम लोग ध्यान देंगे ऐसे कीवर्ड्स के ऊपर जो तीन से लेकर छह वर्ड्स
21:53
की लेंथ के बीच में आते हैं। इससे हमें गुड इनफ सर्च वॉल्यूम भी मिल जाएगा और
21:58
इससे हमें थोड़ा बहुत क्लियर सर्चर भी मिल जाएगा। ऑब्वियसली अलग-अलग इंडस्ट्रीज में
22:04
ये लेंथ हो सकता है कुछ इंडस्ट्रीज में दो से भी काम चल जाए। कुछ इंडस्ट्रीज में सात वर्ड तक जाना पड़े। तो ये ऊपर नीचे थोड़ा
22:10
बहुत आप एक्सपीरियंस से सीख लेंगे। लेकिन अगर हम अभी शुरुआत कर रहे हैं। अभी आप अपने करियर की शुरुआत कर रहे हैं तो तीन
22:16
से छह वर्ड लंबे कीवर्ड को हम टारगेट करेंगे। उसे हम लेके चलेंगे पहले शुरुआती
22:22
फेस में। सो तीन से छह ये नंबर अपने पास दिमाग में फीड करके रखना है। ठीक है? अब आ
22:28
जाते हैं दूसरे पार्ट के ऊपर। कीवर्ड्स का सिर्फ यही टाइप नहीं होता है जहां पर हम स्मॉल और लॉन्ग करें। ये तो एक अलग चीज हो
22:36
गई। अब हम दूसरी चीज़ देख लेते हैं। कीवर्ड की ना अपनी एक और खूबी होती है जो होती है उसकी इंटेंट। अब कीवर्ड इंटेंट क्या है?
22:44
लेट्स से कोई सर्च कर रहा है कार को सिर्फ। अब आपको कार से क्या मिलेगा? जब
22:51
कोई यूजर सर्च करता है कार तो वो क्या जानना चाहता है? आपको नहीं पता। राइट?
22:57
लेकिन अगर कोई सर्च करता है बेस्ट यूज्ड कार इन 10 लाख फॉर ऑफोडिंग तो वो क्या
23:02
करना चाहता है? क्या वो कार बनाना चाहता है? क्या वह कार की फोटो चाहता है या वह
23:07
कार को परचेस करना चाहता है? ऑब्वियसली आप भी समझ सकते हैं। यहां पर वो कार को परचेस
23:13
करने के बारे में इनफेशन ले रहा है। हो सकता है अभी तुरंत परचेस करनी है। हो सकता है 6 महीने बाद परचेस करनी हो। लेकिन
23:18
रिसर्च क्यों कर रहा है? खरीददारी के बारे में ही कर रहा है। ये हमें क्यों पता लग रहा है? क्योंकि इस कीवर्ड का अपना इंटेंट
23:25
ऐसा है। इंटेंट का मतलब उसका पर्पस क्या है? अगर मैं सर्च करता हूं यहां पर
23:31
कार डीआईवाई तो इसका मतलब है कि कार में ही कुछ काम
23:38
मुझे करना है, कुछ छेड़छाड़ करनी है, कुछ चेंजेस करने हैं, कुछ अपग्रेड करना है। मैं उसके टिप्स ढूंढ रहा हूं। मैं
23:44
इंफॉर्मेशनेशन चाहता हूं। अगर मैं यहां पर सर्च करता हूं कार वॉलपेपर तो मैं
23:50
ऑब्वियसली कार को परचेस नहीं करना चाहता हूं। मैं सिर्फ एक इमेज बेस्ड वेबसाइट ढूंढ रहा हूं जिस पर जाकर मैं कार की फोटो
23:55
को डाउनलोड कर लूं। मुझे इंफॉर्मेशनेशन नहीं चाहिए। मुझे ये नहीं जानना कि कार का वॉलपेपर बनाऊं कैसे। मुझे कार का वॉलपेपर
24:01
डाउनलोड करना है। लेकिन अगर मैं यहां पर सर्च कर लेता हूं कार वॉलपेपर डिजाइनिंग
24:07
ट्यूटोरियल तो इसका मतलब है अब मुझे कार का वॉलपेपर बनाने वाले ट्यूटोरियल देखने हैं। यानी कि कीवर्ड के अंदर ही उसका
24:15
इंटेंट छुपा हुआ है। पर्पस छुपा हुआ है। ये जितने भी कीवर्ड के पर्पस हो सकते हैं
24:21
उन सारे पर्पस को हम तीन बड़े पार्ट में डिवाइड कर लेते हैं। पहला तो हो गया नेविगेशनल। ठीक है? दूसरा है मेरा जो टाइप
24:29
है वो है इंफॉर्मेशनल एंड तीसरा है कमर्शियल। कुछ लोग अभी सीट से ऊपर आने की
24:35
कोशिश कर रहे हैं वो लोग नहीं ऊपर आएंगे। आई नो यहां पर एक और तीसरा टाइप भी कई सारे लोग बताते हैं। व्हिच इज़ अ सब टाइप
24:41
ऑफ कमर्शियल कीवर्ड एंड दिस इज़ कॉल्ड ट्रांजैक्शनल।
24:47
ओके? मेजर टाइप तीन ही हैं। अब उसको कुछ लोग ट्रांजैक्शनल को उसी का सब टाइप बता
24:52
लेते हैं। कुछ लोग बोलेंगे नहीं चार टाइप होते हैं। नुकसान कुछ भी नहीं है। राइट? एक्चुअली में कोई वहां पे कॉलम नहीं है
24:58
जहां पर यूजर Google के नीचे क्लिक करता है कि मेरे को ट्रांजैक्शनल रिजल्ट्स चाहिए या मेरे को कमर्शियल रिजल्ट चाहिए।
25:04
बट मेजर मेजर जो कीवर्ड के इंटेंट होते हैं वो तीन होते हैं। नेविगेशनल, इनेशनल,
25:09
कमर्शियल और ट्रांजैक्शनल, कमर्शियल इंटेंट का ही एक टाइप है। अब इन तीनों के
25:15
बीच में डिफरेंस क्या है? लेट्स से कि कोई जाकर सर्च करता है Google पर आधार कार्ड।
25:21
अब क्यों आधार कार्ड सर्च कर रहा है? बिकॉज़ यूजर को आधार कार्ड जहां पे बनता है, जिस वेबसाइट पे बनता है, उस वेबसाइट
25:27
का यूआरएल नहीं याद है। हम में से किसी को याद नहीं रहता है। किसी को जीएसटी फाइल करना है, वो क्या करेगा? वो करेगा जीएसटी
25:34
वेबसाइट। किसी को याद नहीं है वेबसाइट का यूआरएल। राइट? जीएसटी लॉग इन यहां पर जीएसटी लॉग इन वाली वेबसाइट यहां पर दिखाई
25:40
दे रही है। कोई अगर सर्च करता है Facebook तो अब वो क्या लगता है वो Facebook को परचेस करना चाहता है? नहीं ना? क्या वो
25:46
Facebook जैसी वेबसाइट बनाना चाहता है? नहीं। उसका मतलब है उसे सिर्फ Facebook का लॉग इन Facebook.com नहीं टाइप करना था।
25:52
उसने Facebook टाइप कर दिया। तो इस तरह के केसेस में जब यूजर कोई ब्रांड नेम टाइप करता है, कोई पर्टिकुलर यूनिक वर्ड टाइप
25:59
करता है जो किसी ब्रांड से रिलेटेड है, इसका मतलब है कि उसे वेबसाइट नहीं याद है। वो सिर्फ वेबसाइट तक जाना चाहता है,
26:04
नेविगेशन चाहता है। तो हम इस तरह के कीवर्ड को क्या कहते हैं? नेविगेशनल कीवर्ड। ओके? दूसरी हो गई इनफेशनल कीवर्ड।
26:11
यानी कि हाउ टू मेक दाल। ये इनेशनल कीवर्ड है। यहां पर हम
26:19
दाल परचेस नहीं करना चाहते। हम दाल वाली वेबसाइट पर नहीं जाना चाहते। हम ये नहीं जानना चाहते कि कौन दाल बेच रहा है। हम
26:25
सिर्फ दाल बनाना सीखना चाहते हैं। इंफॉर्मेशन चाहिए। हाउ टू मेक दाल या हाउ
26:31
टू टाई अ टाई या हाउ टू प्ले क्रिकेट। ओके? ये
26:40
सारे के सारे कैसे वर्ड्स हैं? ये सारे के सारे इनफार्मेशनल है। अगर मैं सर्च करता हूं व्हाट इज़ लेट्स से क्रिकेट। सो यहां
26:48
पर यह भी इंफॉर्मेशनल है। ओके? हाउ टू टाई अ टाई। मैंने ऑलरेडी बोल दिया है। वेयर डज
26:56
ताज महल इज़ सिचुएटेड? ओके? ये भी क्या है? क्वेरी है। इनेशनल
27:01
है। ये सारी की सारी इनेशन चाहती है। लेकिन अगर मैं सडनली सर्च करता हूं लेट्स से बेस्ट डेंटल क्लीनिक नियर
27:10
दिल्ली। ओके? अब ये कैसी क्वेरी है? क्या बेस्ट डेंटल क्लीनिक नियर दिल्ली को सर्च
27:16
करने वाले डेंटिस्ट बनना चाहते हैं? नहीं। क्या वो डेंटिस्ट के बारे में इंफॉर्मेशन चाहते हैं? यस। वो चाहते हैं कोई क्लीनिक
27:23
मिल जाए आसपास जहां पर जाकर वो अपनी प्रॉब्लम को दिखा सकें। अब किसी भी एक डेंटल क्लीनिक के लिए ये क्या है? एक
27:29
बिजनेस का मौका है। करेक्ट। कॉमर्स मिलेगा, कमर्शियल कीवर्ड हो गया। ओके? तो
27:35
अब हम आ जाते हैं वापस इस क्लासिफिकेशन के ऊपर। नेविगेशनल कीवर्ड वो कीवर्ड हैं
27:40
जिनसे किसी भी एक पर्टिकुलर ब्रांड की वेबसाइट का सिर्फ यूआरएल ढूंढना चाहता है यूजर। इंफॉर्मेशनेशनल कीवर्ड वो कीवर्ड
27:47
हैं जिनसे यूजर कोई इंफॉर्मेशनेशन चाहता है। किसी भी तरह की इनफेशन कोई ट्यूटोरियल हो सकता है, टिप्स हो सकती है, ऐसे ही कुछ
27:54
भी लेकिन इनेशन चाहता है। कमर्शियल कीवर्ड वो कीवर्ड होते हैं जिससे यूजर बिनेस मतलब
28:00
कोई ट्रांजैक्शन करना चाहता है। कुछ प्रोडक्ट परचेस करना है, कोई सर्विस अेल करनी है। ठीक है? है वो सारे के सारे
28:06
कमर्शियल कीवर्ड हो गए। तो फिर ट्रांजैक्शनल का मतलब क्या होता है? जब कोई यूजर सर्च कर रहा है बेस्ट कार अंडर
28:14
10 लाख फॉर ऑफ रोड यूज़ इसका मतलब है कि वो रिसर्च करो परचेस करना चाहता है लेकिन वो
28:19
परचेसिंग के किस फेस में है वो नहीं पता उसे। अगर किसी ने सर्च किया लेट्स से बेस्ट कार अंडर 10 लाख फॉर फैमिली। तो ये
28:30
एक कमर्शियल कीवर्ड हो गया क्योंकि उसे कार परचेस करनी है। राइट? लेकिन अगर कोई दूसरा यूजर आता है और वो सर्च करता है कार
28:37
शोरूम नियर मी इसका मतलब है कि वो जल्दी से
28:43
जल्दी परचेस करना चाहता है। यहां पर ये रिसर्च फेस हो सकता है। लेकिन ये अपने आप में हिंट दे रहा है कि वो अभी परचेस करने
28:48
जा रहा है। इस तरह की क्वेरीज को हम बोलते हैं ट्रांजैक्शनल क्योंकि यूजर
28:54
ट्रांजैक्शन करने के लिए रेडी बैठा है। तो यह हो जाते हैं ट्रांजैक्शनल कीवर्ड। तो
28:59
बिकॉज़ कमर्शियल में सारे के सारे ऐसे कीवर्ड आते हैं जिनसे परचेस सेल हो सकती
29:05
है। ट्रांजैक्शनल में वो कीवर्ड आते हैं जिसमें परचेस सेल अभी हो जाएगी। इट इज़ जस्ट अबाउट दी अर्जेंसी। अगर कमर्शियल
29:12
कीवर्ड में हम अर्जेंसी को ऐड कर दें तो वो हो जाएगा ट्रांजैक्शनल कीवर्ड। इसीलिए मेरा अपना मानना है कि ट्रांजैक्शनल
29:19
कीवर्ड कमर्शियल कीवर्ड का एक टाइप होता है। सो हमारे तीन कीवर्ड टाइप हो गए।
29:24
इंटेंट टाइप हो गए और उसमें एक है उसका सब टाइप। लेकिन अगर कहीं किसी वीडियो में किसी आर्टिकल में कहीं कोई आपको बोलता है
29:31
कि तीन नहीं चार कीवर्ड टाइप होते हैं। चार हैं कीवर्ड इंटेंट तो उससे बहस करने की जरूरत नहीं है। उससे भी कोई नुकसान
29:36
नहीं है। ओके है अपनी-अपनी समझने की बात। सो कीवर्ड के इंटेंट को आपने समझ लिया। अब कुछ हम एग्जांपल्स देख लेते हैं जिससे
29:43
आपको अपने पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड के लिए अपने टॉपिक के लिए इंटेंट को पहचानने में दिक्कत ना हो। सो लेट्स से कि हमारा जो
29:51
कीवर्ड है या जो हमारा टॉपिक है वो है डेंटल क्लीनिक। ओके डेंटल क्लीनिक पुराने
29:59
स्टूडेंट्स जानते हैं मुझे पता नहीं क्यों फॉर सम अननोन कॉस्मिक रीज़ंस मुझे डेंटल क्लीनिक टॉपिक अच्छा लगता है। सो मैं इसी
30:06
को बार-बार यूज़ करता हूं। ओके? बाकी अभी जो नए स्टूडेंट्स हैं उन्हें आदत धीरे-धीरे पड़ जाएगी। इसे बीच में कर लेते
30:12
हैं। फिर से हम एक नया बॉक्स बनाते हैं और यहां पर हम टाइप करना शुरू करते हैं। अ वन
30:18
सेकंड। ठीक है? तो यहां पर सबसे पहले हम एग्जांपल
30:24
देख लेते हैं नेविगेशनल कीवर्ड का। अगर कीवर्ड नेविगेशनल है तो वो कैसा दिखाई
30:30
देगा? क्या होगा? राइट? लेट्स से कि हमारा टॉपिक है डेंटल क्लीनिक। तो अब नेविगेशनल क्लीनिक होगा जब किसी डेंटल क्लीनिक को
30:36
उसके नाम से ही सर्च करें। जैसे फॉर एग्जांपल लेट्स से कोई एक क्लीनिक है स्माइल डेंटल क्लीनिक।
30:44
आई डोंट नो व्हाई। बट काफी सारे डेंटल क्लीनिक्स का नाम स्माइल डेंटल क्लीनिक
30:50
होता है। राइट? तो अगर कोई सर्च करता है स्माइल डेंटल क्लीनिक या फिर लेट्स से कोई
30:55
सर्च कर रहा है तिवारी डेंटल सर्जन या कोई सर्च करता है आजकल एक नया
31:01
ब्रांड आ गया है डेंटल क्लीनिक्स में क्लोव डेंटल
31:07
ओके तो इस तरह से जब आप नाम के साथ में सर्च कर रहे हो डेंटल क्लीनिक के लिए तो
31:13
इसका मतलब है कि आप किसी पर्टिकुलर एक डेंटल क्लीनिक को सर्च कर रहे हो एक डेंटल सर्जन को सर्च कर रहे हो सो वो एक
31:19
नेविगेशनल क्वेरी हो Google दिखाएगा किसे? उसी क्लीनिक की वेबसाइट को दिखाएगा। आइडली
31:24
दिखाना चाहिए। ठीक है? कई बार लोग कंप्लेंट करते हैं कि मेरे अपने कीवर्ड के लिए मेरी वेबसाइट नहीं दिखाई दे रही है।
31:30
इस प्रॉब्लम को हम लोग सॉल्व कर लेंगे आगे आने वाली क्लास में। इसके बाद आता है दूसरा टाइप का कीवर्ड इंटेंट जो है
31:38
इनेशनल। ठीक है? की नेविगेशन हो गया। इनफेशनल हो गया। इनेशनल कीवर्ड क्या हो सकते हैं डेंटल क्लीनिक टॉपिक के लिए? अ
31:46
हाउ टू अवॉइड टूथ कैविटी।
31:54
ठीक है? डेंटल क्लीनिक से रिलेटेड क्वेरी है। लेकिन यहां पर यूजर इंफॉर्मेशन मांग रहा है। हाउ टू अवॉइड डेंटल। ओके? बेस्ट
32:03
होम रेमेडीज फॉर टूथ एक हाउ टू ट्रीट टूथ
32:11
पेन इन किड्स एट होम।
32:16
ओके। व्हाट इज रूट कैनाल? इन सभी क्वेरीज में आप देख रहे होंगे कि हाउ ओके व्हाट यह
32:25
सारे के सारे जो क्वेश्चन वाले वर्ड हैं यह हैं और यह थोड़ी सी लॉन्ग क्वेरीज हैं और इनसे यूजर जो सर्च कर रहा है वो
32:32
इंफॉर्मेशन चाहता है। यहां पर वो किसी भी तरीके से कोई भी ऐसी एक्सपर्टीज नहीं चाह
32:37
रहा है। किसी ब्रांड नेम को नहीं सर्च कर रहा है और कोई परचेस वाली इंटेंट भी नहीं है। यहां पर अवॉयड टूथ कैविटी को अवॉइड
32:43
करना अपने आप में एक नॉर्मल क्वेरी हो सकती है। सो इस तरह की जितनी भी क्वेरीज होंगी, यह इंफॉर्मेशनेशनल क्वेरीज होंगी।
32:50
ओके? इसके बाद आ जाते हैं हम कमर्शियल इंटेंट के ऊपर। कमर्शियल इंटेंट के लिए आने वाली जितनी भी क्वेरीज होंगी, उनके
32:55
अंदर परचेस के बारे में पूछा जाएगा। उनके अंदर प्राइसिंग के बारे में पूछा जाएगा। सो, लेट्स से अ मोस्ट अफोर्डेबल डेंटल
33:03
सर्जन इन दिल्ली। यह अपने आप में कमर्शियल क्वेरी हो जाएगी। अ बेस्ट बसेस
33:12
फॉर किड्स। ओके? या फिर रूट कैनाल वर्सेस
33:18
टूथ रिमूवल। इस तरह की जो क्वेरीज है वो कमर्शियल होंगी। बिकॉज़ अगर कोई रूट कैनाल
33:23
और टूथ रिमूवल के बीच में डाउट में आ रहा है तो उसे वन और दी अदर प्रोसेस की जरूरत
33:28
है। इज़ जस्ट दैट अभी वो डिसाइड नहीं कर पा रहा है कि किस तरह की प्रोसेस के लिए जाना चाहिए। ठीक है? इसके बाद आ जाता है एक सब
33:35
टाइप कमर्शियल कैटेगरी का है जो कि है ट्रांजैक्शनल। नाउ यहां पर हमने ऑलरेडी ऐसे कीवर्ड्स को कवर कर लिया है जो परचेस
33:43
के बारे में जानना चाहते हैं, जो सर्विस को अवेल करना चाहते हैं। लेकिन फिर ट्रांजैक्शनल में क्या होगा? ट्रांजैक्शनल
33:48
कीवर्ड्स कुछ ऐसे होंगे जो इमीडिएट परचेस की तरफ हिंट करते हैं। फॉर एग्जांपल इमरजेंसी
33:55
डेंटल क्लीनिक या फिर बेस्ट रूट कैनाल
34:02
डेंटिस्ट नियर मी। राइट इन दिल्ली नहीं नियर मी। इन दिल्ली अपने आप में एक इनेशन
34:08
लेना चाह रहा है। नियर मी मतलब यूजर अपने आसपास ही ढूंढ रहा है और वह जो भी पर्सन पर मिलेगा उसी को वो हमेशा अ ऑप्ट करने की
34:16
कोशिश करेगा। वहां पर विजिट करने की कोशिश करेगा। सो कमर्शियल और ट्रांजैक्शनल के बीच में जो डिफरेंस आता है वो सिर्फ
34:22
अर्जेंसी का होता है। कमर्शियल लॉन्ग टर्म में फ्यूचर में होने वाली क्वेरी है जो मे
34:27
बी हो सकता है बिनेस की तरफ पॉइंट कर सके। ट्रांजैक्शन में यूजर अभी इमीडिएटली परचेस करना चाहता है। नाउ यहां पर जब आप नियर मी
34:35
देख रहे हैं तो में से जितने भी एक्सपीरियंस एसइओस हैं वो समझ रहे होंगे कि नियर मी टाइप की जितनी भी क्वेरीज होती
34:40
हैं वो हम लोकल एसइओ में कवर करते हैं। राइट? सो इसका मतलब ये भी है कि लोकल एसइओ की जितनी भी क्वेरीज होती हैं वो सारी की
34:45
सारी ट्रांजैक्शनल क्वेरीज होती हैं। वो सारी की सारी हाई वैल्यू कीवर्ड्स क्वेरीज होती हैं। और इसीलिए कभी कबभार इनके लिए
34:52
रैंक करने में दिक्कत होती है। इनफेशनल या फिर नेविगेशनल क्वेरीज के लिए रैंक करना कंपेरेटिवली इजी है। लेकिन कमर्शियल और
34:58
ट्रांजैक्शनल क्वेरीज टफ होती है। बिकॉज़ उसमें कंपटीशन भी टफ होता है। उसमें मनी इनवॉल्वड है। अगर रैंक करेंगे तो सीधे-सीधे पैसा मिलेगा। इसीलिए थोड़ा सा
35:05
टाइम लगता है। सो आई होप अब आपको किसी भी कीवर्ड को देखकर यह पहचानने में दिक्कत नहीं होगी कि ये फला कीवर्ड ट्रांजैक्शनल
35:11
है या फिर कमर्शियल है या फिर इनफेशनल है या फिर नेविगेशनल है। तो कांसेप्ट्स आपने समझ लिया। आपने कीवर्ड की लेंथ को समझ
35:18
लिया। आपने उसके इंटेंट को समझ लिया। नाउ कीवर्ड के इंटेंट को समझने के बाद आपको एक और मीट्रिक समझना जरूरी है जिसे कहते हैं
35:26
प्यार से। बहुत प्यार से इसको कहा जाता है के डी। केडी का मतलब हो गया कीवर्ड
35:33
डिफी ल्टी कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी क्या हुआ? कीवर्ड को जब टाइप करना बहुत डिफिकल्ट होता है तो
35:40
उसे कहा जाता है कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी। रॉन्ग। जब किसी कीवर्ड के लिए रैंक करना मुश्किल
35:47
होता है उसे हम बोलते हैं कीवर्ड को डिफिकल्ट होना। ओके? तो एक एक सॉर्ट ऑफ
35:54
इमेजिनरी नंबर आप सोच लीजिए। लेट्स से कि हमारे पास एक स्केल है। ये है मेरे पास एक
36:00
स्केल। यहां पर जो नंबर है वो है वन। और यहां पर जो नंबर है वो है 100। ठीक है?
36:07
यहां पर जो ये नंबर है वन इसका मतलब है कि कीवर्ड इज इजी टू रैंक।
36:13
ओके? और जो ये 100 नंबर है वो ये कहता है कीवर्ड इज़ हार्ड टू रैंक। नाउ लेट्स से एक
36:19
यहां पर एक कीवर्ड है अमित तिवारी दी एनिमेटर।
36:26
आई एम ऑलरेडी सॉरी। अगर कोई अमित तिवारी नाम से जाने पहचाने एनिमेटर है। आई डोंट नो। बट अगर कोई अमित तिवारी दी एनिमेटर
36:33
नाम के इस कीवर्ड के लिए रैंक करना चाहता है तो प्रोबब्ली बहुत इजी है। आराम से रैंक कर जाएगा। क्यों? बिकॉज़ अमित तिवारी
36:39
नाम के कोई फेमस एनिमेटर को एटलीस्ट मैं तो नहीं जानता हूं। सो जिस कीवर्ड के लिए कोई कंपटीशन है ही नहीं जिस पर कोई कोई
36:46
एफर्ट नहीं मार रहा है उसके लिए अमित तिवारी एनिमेटर कीवर्ड के लिए आराम से रैंक किया जा सकता है। इमेजिन आज से 10
36:51
साल पहले अगर कोई चैट जीपीटी नाम के वर्ड के लिए अगर एफर्ट मारता वेबसाइट को रैंक
36:57
कराना चाहता तो आराम से रैंक करता था क्योंकि तब चैट जीपीटी नाम की कुछ चीज थी ही नहीं। आज की तारीख में अगर आप चैट
37:03
जीपीटी कीवर्ड के लिए अपनी वेबसाइट को रैंक कराना चाहेंगे तो प्रोबेब्ली आप कभी नहीं करा पाएंगे। बिकॉज़ Google अंडरस्टैंड्स कि चैट GPT के लिए चैट
37:09
GPT.com जो ओपन एआई का अपना खुद का डोमेन है, अपनी खुद की वेबसाइट है वही रैंक करेगी। तो अगर आप किसी एक ऐसे कीवर्ड के
37:18
लिए रैंक करने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं जिसके लिए रैंक करना बहुत आसान है तो उसका डिफिकल्टी लेवल हमने एक मान लिया। और अगर
37:25
कोई ऐसा कीवर्ड है जिसके लिए रैंक करना बहुत मुश्किल है। फॉर एग्जांपल लेट्स से
37:31
बेस्ट क्रेडिट कार्ड फॉर वुमेन। जो लोग ज्यादा क्रेडिट कार्ड इंडस्ट्री में क्रेडिट कार्ड रिलेटेड वेबसाइट्स में डील
37:37
नहीं करते हैं उन्हें शायद ना लगे लेकिन यह भी अपने आप में एक काफी टफ कीवर्ड है जिसके लिए रैंक करना बड़ा मुश्किल है। ओके
37:42
तो अब अगर इस तरह के आप एक हाई कंपैरेटिव कीवर्ड के लिए अगर आप रैंक करना चाह रहे
37:47
हैं तो इसका डिफिकल्टी लेवल 100 हो सकता है। बहुत टफ है। तो इस तरीके से हम कीवर्ड
37:53
डिफिकल्टी को इमेजिन करते हैं। जहां पर ये नंबर जो बढ़ता हुआ नंबर है वन से 100 के बीच में ये बताता है कि कोई एक पर्टिकुलर
37:59
कीवर्ड रैंक करने में कितना टफ है। Google जब किसी कीवर्ड की डिफिकल्टी को लेवल में
38:04
डिवाइड करता है फॉर एग्जांपल इजी, मीडियम, हाई। वहां पर Google देखता है कि इस पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड के लिए कितने लोग Google
38:10
एडवर्ड्स में यानी Google के ऐड प्लेटफार्म पर बड कर रहे हैं और उसके बेस पर वो एक डिफिकल्टी का लेवल प्रोवाइड करता
38:16
है। सेमरश और एचरेf जैसे टूल किसी पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड के लिए सर्च वॉल्यूम
38:21
उसके लिए कितनी सारी वेबसाइट्स अलग-अलग बिड कर रही हैं। टारगेट कर रही हैं उसे पेजेस के कितने नंबर हैं? और इसके अलावा
38:28
उस कीवर्ड का अपना खुद का इंटेंट क्या है? उसकी लेंथ क्या है? इसके बेस पर डिसाइड करते हैं कि इस पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड का
38:34
डिफिकल्टी लेवल क्या होगा। दोनों का नंबर मैच नहीं करेगा लेकिन मोर और लेस एक हमें
38:39
आईडिया मिल जाता है। सो ऐसा कोई मैजिक नंबर नहीं है कि आप 71 या फिर 83 या फिर
38:45
34 ऐसा कोई खास नंबर नहीं है कि इस पर्टिकुलर डिफिकल्टी लेवल के कीवर्ड को अगर आप टारगेट करोगे तो आप सक्सेसफुल हो
38:52
जाओगे। हमें एक एप्रोक्समेट आईडिया लेकर चलना पड़ता है। जैसे अभी थोड़ी देर पहले मैंने कीवर्ड की लेंथ के बारे में बात की
38:59
थी कि अगर आप थ्री से सिक्स वर्ड के बीच की लेंथ वाले कीवर्ड को अगर आप टारगेट
39:04
करते हैं तो आपके लिए रैंक करना इजी रहेगा इन द स्टार्टिंग फेस। वैसे ही जब हम अ कीवर्ड की डिफिकल्टी लेवल को देखते हैं तो
39:11
शुरुआती फेस में हम ये देखते हैं कि हम एकदम इजी कीवर्ड भी ना लें। बिकॉज़ अगर वो एकदम ईजी है तो हो सकता है उसकी डिमांड ही
39:18
नहीं है और एकदम हाई वैल्यू जो एकदम टफ कीवर्ड्स हैं 80 से ऊपर जिनका केडी जा रहा है उनको भी टारगेट नहीं करते बिकॉज़ अभी
39:24
उनके लिए रैंक करना बड़ा मुश्किल हो जाएगा। जब आप धीरे-धीरे अपनी वेबसाइट को ग्रो करेंगे उस वो वेबसाइट बहुत ही लंबी
39:31
क्वेरीज़ के लिए जो लॉन्ग कीवर्ड्स हैं उनके लिए अच्छे से रैंक कर रही होगी। तो वहां पर आपके लिए रैंक करना इजी हो जाएगा।
39:38
जितने भी टफ कीवर्ड्स हैं लेकिन शुरुआती फज़ में बिगिनिंग पीरियड में एंड स्पेशली अभी आपका करियर जिस लेवल पे है उसमें हम
39:44
टफ कीवर्ड्स की तरफ नहीं जाते हैं। सो अभी अगले फज़ में जब हम कीवर्ड रिसर्च को ऑन पेपर करेंगे तब वहां पर हम हमेशा ऐसे
39:50
कीवर्ड्स को टारगेट करेंगे जिनकी लेंथ तीन से लेकर छह वर्ड्स के बीच में है और जिनकी
39:55
कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी मिडिल लेवल पर है। मीडियम है। ना बहुत ज्यादा इजी ना बहुत ज्यादा टफ। ओके? नाउ यहां पर दो और वर्ड
40:04
हैं जिनको आप बार-बार सुनेंगे और उनसे कंफ्यूज नहीं होना। एक तो है लॉन्ग टेल
40:09
कीवर्ड। लॉन्ग टेल कीवर्ड वही कीवर्ड है जिसकी लेंथ ज्यादा है। जैसे अगर कोई छह
40:15
वर्ड का कीवर्ड है या सात वर्ड का, आठ वर्ड का, 10 वर्ड का जितनी पूंछ लंबी
40:20
जितना लंबा कीवर्ड होता जा रहा है, उसे हम बोलते हैं लॉन्ग टेल कीवर्ड। यह सही है। लॉन्ग टेल कीवर्ड इज़ अ रियल वर्ड। एक होता
40:27
है सिमेंटिक कीवर्ड। सिमेंटिक कीवर्ड जैसी कोई चीज नहीं होती है। अ ये अपने आप में गलत वर्ड है। इसके इसका कोई मीनिंग ही
40:33
नहीं है। इट इट डजंट हैव एनी मीनिंग व्हाट सो एवर। ओके? तो उस फ्रॉड में नहीं पड़ना है। नाउ अब हम आ जाते हैं एक्चुअल में इस
40:41
कीवर्ड रिसर्च की प्रोसेस के ऊपर और हम कीवर्ड रिसर्च को करके देखेंगे। कीवर्ड रिसर्च को करने के लिए जिस टूल को मैं
40:47
आपको रेकमेंड करूंगा वो है Google शीट्स। कुछ लोग समरश को यूज़ करके कीवर्ड रिसर्च
40:54
करते हैं। कुछ लोग एचरे को यूज़ करते हैं। कुछ Google के कीवर्ड प्लानर को यूज़ करते हैं। और वो सारे के सारे सही हैं। गलत
41:00
नहीं है। कीवर्ड रिसर्च का अपना कोई एक 100% एक्यूरेट तरीका नहीं है। इट्स अ
41:06
नॉर्मल जेन्युइन प्रोसेस। एसइओ टेक्निकल भी है और क्रिएटिव भी है। ये एसइओ का एक
41:13
ऐसा पार्ट है जो क्रिएटिव है। कीवर्ड रिसर्च हो गया। कंटेंट की प्लानिंग हो गई। कंटेंट की राइटिंग हो गई। कंटेंट का
41:18
पब्लिश करना, इमेज को जनरेट करना। इमेज को डिसाइड करना, वीडियो जनरेट करना, वीडियो को डिसाइड करना। ये सारी क्रिएटिव प्रोसेस
41:25
हैं। कई बार क्लासेस में अभी पिछली लाइव क्लास में भी किसी स्टूडेंट ने पूछा था कि हमें कैसे पता चलेगा कि किसी पर्टिकुलर
41:31
टॉपिक के लिए कीवर्ड की लेंथ कितनी होनी चाहिए? और इसका जवाब है सिर्फ आपका क्रिएटिव एक्सपीरियंस। जब आप बार-बार
41:38
कंटेंट लिखेंगे तो आपको अपने आप आईडिया लगना शुरू हो जाता है कि हां ये पर्टिकुलर जो टाइप का कीवर्ड है इसके लिए इतनी लेंथ
41:45
होनी चाहिए। या इस टाइप का कंटेंट चलेगा। दिस इज अ हंच दैट यू डेवलप बाय एक्सपीरियंस।
41:51
तो हम अपनी प्रोसेस में अभी जो मैं आपको दिखाऊंगा उसमें हम सेमरश को भी यूज़ करेंगे। उसमें Google के कीवर्ड प्लानर को
41:58
यूज़ करेंगे। उसमें हम Google को इटसेल्फ भी यूज़ करेंगे। आल्सो आस्क को यूज़ करेंगे। हम कई सारे अलग-अलग
42:03
टूल्स को फ्री पेड सभी को मिलाकर एक बड़ी पिक्चर बनाना चाहते हैं। एक आईडिया डेवलप
42:09
करना चाहते हैं। और वहां से हम अपने कीवर्ड्स को ड्राइव करते हैं। एंड देन इसके बाद उस लिस्ट को फाइनल करते हैं। ठीक
42:15
है? तो हम Google शीe को ओपन करेंगे और Google शीe को ओपन करने के बाद यहां पर हम काम करना चालू करेंगे। सो हमारे पास जो
42:22
टॉपिक है वो हमें पता है। टॉपिक हमारा क्या है? डेंटल क्लीनिक। हम टॉपिक डेंटल क्लीनिक ही रखेंगे। यहां पर एक डॉक भी ओपन
42:27
कर लेता हूं। Google शीट्स, Google डॉक्स इनके साथ दोस्ती बना ली। तो हमें अपनी Google शीट को प्रिपेयर करना होगा। कीवर्ड
42:34
रिसर्च के लिए। सबसे पहले हम यहां पर एंटर कर देते हैं। वर्ड सीड कीवर्ड। ओके? सीड
42:40
कीवर्ड क्या है? अभी थोड़ी देर में एक्सप्लेन करता हूं। देन इसके बाद आ जाएगा मेरा कीवर्ड। इसके बाद आ जाता है सर्च
42:46
वॉल्यूम। यह भी एक नया वर्ड है। अभी तक मैंने नहीं बताया है। कोई बात नहीं थोड़े बहुत सरप्राइज़ रहने चाहिए। वरना लोग पहले
42:52
वीडियो देख के कल्टी कर लेते हैं। सर्च वॉल्यूम के बाद हम आ जाते हैं कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी के ऊपर।
42:59
इसके बाद हम आ जाते हैं इंटेंट के ऊपर। एंड इसके बाद एक और वर्ड लिख लेते हैं
43:04
लेंथ। ठीक है? सो सीड कीवर्ड, कीवर्ड, सर्च वॉल्यूम, कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी एंड इंटेंट और साथ ही में है उसके लेंथ। इसको
43:11
थोड़ा बहुत हम एडजस्ट करते रहेंगे। यहां पर अपनी शीट को एक नाम दे देते हैं। अ कीवर्ड
43:17
रिसर्च क्लास। मैं क्लास नाम देता हूं। आप कुछ भी नाम रख दें। नाउ व्हाट इज सीड
43:22
कीवर्ड? सीड कीवर्ड वो एक फ्रेज़ है जिससे आपको कीवर्ड मिलेंगे। ये वो कीवर्ड हैं जिन्हें हम अपनी वेबसाइट पे टारगेट
43:28
करेंगे। अलग-अलग पेजेस में टारगेट करेंगे। अगर आप सिर्फ एसइओ के लिए काम नहीं कर रहे
43:34
हैं। अगर आप एड्स के लिए काम कर रहे हैं या आप सोशल मीडिया के लिए काम कर रहे हैं तो वहां पर भी आप कीवर्ड रिसर्च को सिमिलर इसी प्रोसेस में करेंगे। सो यहां पर सीड
43:40
कीवर्ड क्या हो सकता है? लेट्स से कि आप डेंटिस्ट के लिए जा रहे हैं एसइओ करने के लिए। एक आपको कीवर्ड रिसर्च कैंपेन के लिए
43:47
करना है। सो अब एक डेंटिस्ट के लिए आप सीड कीवर्ड क्या हो सकता है? डेंटिस्ट,
43:55
डेंटल क्लीनिक,
44:00
डेंटल सर्जन, इनमें से जो जो भी अप्लाई होते हैं उन्हें
44:05
आप करेंगे। अगर आप एक छोटे क्लाइंट के लिए कर रहे हैं, एसइओ कैंपेन कर रहे हैं तो अगर वो डेंटिस्ट है उस डेंटिस्ट का अपना
44:11
क्लीनिक होगा। तो आपको जब एसइओ करेंगे आपको डेंटिस्ट को एज पर्सन भी प्रमोट करना पड़ेगा और डेंटल क्लीनिक को भी प्रमोट
44:18
करना पड़ेगा। अगर वो सर्जरी भी करते हैं डेंटल तो आप डेंटल सर्जन सीड कीवर्ड को भी यूज़ कर सकते हैं। नाउ ये तीनों क्या है?
44:24
ये सिर्फ सीड हैं। क्योंकि इनके बेस पर आपको बहुत सारे कीवर्ड्स मिलेंगे। लेकिन अभी फिलहाल ये क्या है? ये सिर्फ और सिर्फ
44:31
सीड है। तो हम इन सीड कीवर्ड्स को अपने पास नोट करके रख लेते हैं और इन सीड कीवर्ड्स के बेस पर अपने कीवर्ड्स को
44:37
निकालना ढूंढना शुरू करते हैं। सबसे पहला काम मैं करूंगा कि मैंने इस सीड कीवर्ड को कॉपी कर लिया। अब हमारे पास बहुत सारे
44:44
एवेन्यू है जहां से हम डेटा को निकाल सकते हैं। सबसे पहले हम जाते हैं Google पर ही चले जाते हैं। ओके? अगर आप सेम उसी कंट्री
44:51
में रहते हैं जिस कंट्री में आप प्रमोट करने जा रहे हैं अपने क्लाइंट को तो आप यूज़ कर सकते हैं इस मेथड को या अगर आप उस
44:57
कंट्री में नहीं रहते हैं तो भी आप किसी वीpए सर्विस प्रोवाइडर को यूज़ करके आप इस सेम प्रोसेस को रिपीट करेंगे। सो यहां पर
45:04
जैसे ही मैं एंटर करता हूं Google के अंदर डेंटिस्ट तो मुझे यहां पर नीचे क्योंकि मेरी लोकेशन क्या है? अभी दिल्ली है। सो
45:11
यहां पर मुझे नीचे आइडियाज़ दिखाई देने शुरू हो जाते हैं। डेंटिस्ट दिल्ली, डेंटिस्ट न्यू दिल्ली, डेंटिस्ट ट्री,
45:16
डेंटिस्ट इन द्वारका, डेंटिस्ट नियर बाय, डेंटिस्ट इन वसंत कुंज, डेंटिस्ट्री मीनिंग, डेंटिस्ट लोगो, डेंटिस्ट नियर मी।
45:23
ओके? सो, मैंने यहां पर इन सारे वर्ड्स को एक-एक करके लिखना शुरू कर देता हूं।
45:29
डेंटिस्ट नियर मी, डेंटिस्ट ट्री। देन इसके बाद
45:35
यहां पर फ्रेज है डेंटिस्ट न्यू दिल्ली डेंटिस्ट इन द्वारका डेंटिस्ट दिल्ली भी है
45:43
डेंटिस्ट दिल्ली डेंटिस्ट द्वारका
45:48
डेंटिस्ट इन वसंत कुंज
45:54
ओके नाउ मे बी आपके दिमाग में क्वेश्चन आएगा कि ये इस तरह से तो बहुत सारे आलतू-फालतू वर्ड्स मुझे मिलते जाएंगे मैं इनको क्यों लिख रहा हूं क्योंकि रिसर्च का
46:00
मतलब क्या होता है रिसर्च इज नॉट सर्च सर्चिंग समथिंग एंड देयर इज़ कॉपींग पेस्टिंग। उसे कॉपी पेस्ट ही बोला जाएगा।
46:08
जब आप सर्च रिसर्च का मतलब है बार-बार आप सर्च कर रहे हो। किसी प्रोसेस को बार-बार आप रिपीट कर रहे हो। बहुत सारी आपको फॉल्स
46:15
इनफेशन मिलेगी। बहुत सारी आपको इधर-उधर की इनफार्मेशन मिलेगी। उन सारी इनफेशन को आप डिटेल को कलेक्ट करेंगे और कलेक्ट करने के
46:21
बाद उसमें अपना एक्सपीरियंस डालेंगे। अपनी नॉलेज डालेंगे और फिर उससे फाइंडिंग निकालेंगे। वो होती है रिसर्च। अगर आप
46:27
सेमरश पर जाते हो और सेमरश पर सिर्फ आप टाइप कर देते हो अपने सेम सीड कीवर्ड को एंड इसके बाद जो भी वहां से डेटा मिलता है
46:33
उसको आप एक्सपोर्ट कर लेते हो तो वो रिसर्च नहीं है वो सिर्फ आप डेटा को डाउनलोड ही कर रहे हो अगर आप इतनी आसान
46:40
तरीके से काम करोगे तो आपको रिजल्ट कभी नहीं मिलेंगे अगर इतना ही आसान होता एसइओ तो सेमरश बनाने वाले भी कोई ऐसी सर्विस
46:45
प्रोवाइड कर देते लेकिन वो भी टूल्स प्रोवाइड करते हैं वो एसइओ नहीं करते हैं ओके सो वैसे जो सेमरश के लिए मैंने
46:52
प्रोसेस बताई है इस प्रोसेस को भी एक्सप्लेन करूंगा मैं आपको पहले खुद खुद से हाथ से जो है वो ऐड करना, सब्सट्रैक्ट
46:58
करना, मल्टीप्लाई करना सिखाऊंगा। इसके बाद कैलकुलेटर भी यूज़ करना सिखाऊंगा। ओके? सो अभी फिलहाल हम मेहनत से काम करेंगे।
47:04
डेंटिस्ट नियर बाय भी मेरे पास एक सीड कीवर्ड के बेस पर एक कीवर्ड निकल के आ रहा है। डेंटिस्ट नियर बाय आई थिंक मैंने लिख
47:11
लिया नहीं लिखा है। डेंटिस्ट नियर बाय। ठीक है? अभी ये सारे के सारे हमें मिल रहे हैं कीवर्ड। ठीक है ना? जब ये कीवर्ड हमें
47:18
मिल जाएंगे इन कीवर्ड के बेस पर हम देखेंगे कि इसमें कौन सा अच्छा है, किसे यूज़ करना है, किसे नहीं यूज़ करना है। अभी
47:23
से क्यों परेशान होना? ठीक है ना? अभी तो हमने शुरू किया है इस प्रोसेस को सिर्फ। सो यहां पर डेंटिस्ट आ गया और डेंटिस्ट के
47:29
बाद यहां पर मुझे और आ रहा है डेंटिस्ट मीनिंग दिखाई दे रहा है। डेंटिस्ट नियर मी दिखाई दे रहा है। अब यहां पर जैसे डेंटिस्ट मीनिंग सजेशन में आ रहा है।
47:35
डेंटिस्ट मीनिंग कैसी क्वेरी है? ये है एक इंफॉर्मेशनेशनल क्वेरी। ये नेविगेशनल नहीं है। ये कमर्शियल नहीं है। तो अभी बिकॉज़
47:42
मैं ट्यूटोरियल कर रहा हूं और आप अपने एसइओ जर्नी को शुरू कर रहे हैं। आप सब कुछ लिखेंगे। लेकिन आज से 6 महीने बाद जब आपने
47:48
ये प्रोसेस कई बार रिपीट कर लिया है और आपको पता है कि भाई मुझे इनफेशनल क्वेरी अभी इस कैंपेन में नहीं टारगेट करनी है।
47:53
मैं सिर्फ कमर्शियल कीवर्ड के पीछे जाऊंगा तो मैं यहां पर डेंटिस्ट मीनिंग को लिखूंगा ही नहीं या डेंटिस्ट लोगो जैसे
47:59
यहां पर सजेशन में आ रहा है मैं डेंटिस्ट लोगो भी नहीं लिखूंगा। राइट? क्यों? बिकॉज़ ये मेरे काम के नहीं है। मैं डेंटिस्ट
48:04
नियर मी को अपने आप से पहले से लिख लेता हूं। क्योंकि डेंटिस्ट नियर मी अपने आप में एक ऐसी क्वेरी है जो कमर्शियल कीवर्ड
48:10
होता है। इनफैक्ट ट्रांजैक्शनल कीवर्ड होता है। तो मैं यहां पर इसे पहले से लिख लूंगा। ठीक है? लेकिन अभी फिलहाल हम इस सारे काम को करते रहेंगे। अब यहां पर एक
48:17
तो सीड कीवर्ड हमने यूज़ कर लिया डेंटिस्ट। दूसरा सीड कीवर्ड हमारा हो गया डेंटल क्लीनिक। तो मैं यहां पर आकर डेंटल
48:22
क्लीनिक भी सर्च करता हूं। डेंटल क्लीनिक। अब डेंटल क्लीनिक के नीचे कैसी क्वेरीज आ
48:28
रही है? डेंटल क्लीनिक दिल्ली, न्यू दिल्ली, गुड़गांव इमेजेस, बैनर पोस्टर। ओके? मैं यहां पर लिख लेता हूं। डेंटल
48:36
क्लीनिक, इमेजेस, डेंटल क्लीनिक बैनर पोस्टर।
48:42
दिल्ली डेंटल क्लीनिक गुड़गांव कीवर्ड रिसर्च अपने आप में एक बहुत ही
48:48
कॉम्प्लेक्स और बहुत ही इंपॉर्टेंट प्रोसेस है। जो लोग इस प्रोसेस में अपने हाथ गंदे नहीं करते, दिमाग थकाते नहीं,
48:54
मेहनत नहीं करते, उनको कभी रिजल्ट मिलते भी नहीं। जब आप सिम जिस जिस वजह से मैं इन टूल्स को बहुत ज्यादा एप्रिशिएट नहीं करता
49:02
हूं। बहुत ज्यादा इनके बारे में बात नहीं करता हूं। बिकॉज़ शुरुआती फज़ में अगर आप टूल के सहारे रहेंगे, आपने कभी कीवर्ड सर्च हाथ से किया ही नहीं है। आपको पता ही
49:09
नहीं कि वो कीवर्ड जो एक अच्छा कीवर्ड है उसको ढूंढ के लाने में कितनी मेहनत करनी पड़ती है। उसके साथ में एसोसिएटेड वर्ड्स
49:15
क्या हैं? कौन सी हैं वो चीजें जो नेगेटिव हैं। सो जब आप इस प्रोसेस को जान करते हैं
49:21
आराम से अपनी अपनी मर्जी से करते हैं। अपना दिमाग लगा के करते हैं, अपने हाथ से करते हैं तो आपको ज्यादा समझ में आता है।
49:26
जैसे यहां पर मैंने डेंटल सर्जन टाइप किया। अब डेंटल सर्जन के दिल्ली के बाद में डेंटल सर्जन रिक्रूटमेंट आ रहा है।
49:32
डेंटल सर्जन वैकेंसी आ रही है। डेंटल सर्जन यूपीएससी आ रहा है। डेंटल सर्जन अह वैकेंसी इन यूपीएससी आ रही है। सैलरी के
49:38
बारे में आ रहा है। यानी कि ये बिनेस ओरिएंटेड कीवर्ड्स हैं ही नहीं। ये वो कीवर्ड नहीं है जिन्हें पेशेंट ढूंढ रहा
49:45
है। डेंटल सर्जन दिल्ली के अलावा। ये सारे वो कीवर्ड्स हैं जिनको जॉब सीकर ढूंढ रहे
49:50
हैं। अब हम अगर अपनी वेबसाइट को पेशेंट्स के लिए ऑप्टिमाइज कर रहे हैं तो हम डेंटल सर्जन के पीछे नहीं जाएंगे। इसका मतलब
49:55
हमें यहां से सही रिजल्ट नहीं मिलने वाला है। मैं यहीं से इसे छोड़ दूंगा। राइट? अब अगर आपने इस पर्टिकुलर प्रोसेस को अपने
50:02
हाथ से नहीं किया होता तो आप डेंटल सर्जन जाकर सीड कीवर्ड कहीं किसी और जगह पर एंटर करते। जो भी मिलता उसको अपनी प्रोसेस में
50:08
यूज़ कर रहे होते। सो अब मेरे पास यहां पर ये कीवर्ड आ गए हैं। अब मैं दूसरा टूल एक यूज़ करके देखता हूं। यहां पर हम आ जाते
50:15
हैं और चलते हैं Google कीवर्ड प्लानर के ऊपर। सो Google कीवर्ड प्लानर Google एड्स के अंदर मौजूद एक यूटिलिटी एक टूल है जिसे
50:22
हम यूज़ करते हैं कीवर्ड रिसर्च के लिए। कि Google ने इसे एसइओस के लिए नहीं बनाया था। लेकिन फिर भी हम एसइओस इसे यूज़ कर
50:28
लेते हैं। नाउ वैसे यहां पर शीट में एक और चीज जिसे मुझे मेंशन करना चाहिए तो मैंने
50:34
यहां पर मेंशन नहीं किया है। एंड दैट इज ट्रेंड। अब ये ट्रेंड क्या है? ये अभी हम थोड़ी देर में देख लेंगे। यहां पर आ जाते
50:41
हैं। और ये Google एड्स का डैशबोर्ड है। अभी आप लोग जो करियर शुरू कर रहे हैं उनको यह बहुत थोड़ा सा हो सकता है टफ सा लगे
50:48
लेकिन अभी आपको परेशान होने की या सोचने की भी जरूरत नहीं। यहां पर आ गए। लॉग इन कर लिया। हमने एक बार यहां पर सर्च कर
50:53
लेते हैं कीवर्ड प्लानर। ठीक है? यहां पर टूल्स में दिखाई दे रहा है। नाउ Google एड्स का ये अकाउंट कैसे बनाते हैं? ये
50:59
प्रोसेस मैंने नहीं बताई है। मैं एक वीडियो लिंक कर दूंगा। अगर आप उस वीडियो को देखेंगे तो आपको पता लग जाएगा कि Google एड्स का अकाउंट एक्चुअली में बनाया
51:06
कैसे जाता है। जिनके पास नहीं है। मैं Google एड्स बोल रहा हूं। एड्स में पैसे लगते हैं। लेकिन यहां पर कीवर्ड प्लानर को
51:12
यूज़ करने के लिए आपको पैसे लगाने की जरूरत नहीं पड़ेगी। आपको सिर्फ अपनी Gmail आईडी से Google एड्स में लॉगिन करना होगा।
51:18
बेसिक अकाउंट सेटअप होगा। इधर-उधर इनेशन मांगते हैं। उसके बाद आप इसे यूज़ कर सकते हैं। लेकिन एक डिफरेंस है। अगर आप किसी
51:26
ऐसी Gmail आईडी को यूज़ करके Google एड्स में लॉग इन करते हैं जिसने आज तक कभी भी एड्स नहीं चलाए हैं तो उसको Google के इस
51:34
कीवर्ड प्लानर से डेटा थोड़ा एप्रोक्समेट मिलता है। यानी कि एग्जैक्ट टर्म नहीं मिलेंगे। थोड़ा एप्रोक्समेट डेटा मिलेगा।
51:41
रेंज मिलेगी। राइट? अगर आप थोड़ा उसी Gmail आईडी से आपने थोड़े बहुत एड्स रन किए हुए हैं। कुछ पैसा खर्च किया हुआ है
51:47
तो आपको एग्जैक्ट डाटा मिलना शुरू हो जाता है। लेकिन जो लोग शुरू कर रहे हैं आपके लिए इतना भी इनफ है। मैं सबसे पहले Google
51:54
के ही टूल्स को यूज़ करके आपको कीवर्ड रिसर्च बता रहा हूं ताकि आपको ऐसा ना लगे कि मुझे अपनी एसइओ जर्नी को शुरू करने के
52:01
लिए समरश का $200 का सब्सक्रिप्शन लेना जरूरी है। आई थिंक $200 ज्यादा बोल दिया मैंने। 100 के आसपास का सब्सक्रिप्शन होता
52:08
है इनका। उसे लेना जरूरी है। नहीं है जरूरी है। मतलब अगर ले लेते हो तो काम आसान हो जाएगा। डाटा आपको और ज्यादा मिल
52:15
जाता है। लेकिन उससे पहले कैलकुलेटर सीखने से पहले खुद से हाथ से मैथ्स मैटिक्स करना
52:21
जरूरी है। ऑल्सो एक छोटा सा नुकसान ये भी है। कई सारे लोग ऐसा भी रेकमेंड करेंगे कि
52:26
चलो फुल सब्सक्रिप्शन मत लो। कुछ ग्रुप बाइंग वाले टूल हैं। क्यों पहले से पाइरेसी के चक्कर में पड़ते हो? है ना?
52:32
पहले मेहनत करना सीखना जरूरी है। सो यहां पर हम आ जाते हैं Google के इस कीवर्ड प्लानर के ऊपर। अब यहां पर कीवर्ड प्लानर
52:38
में आपको दो ऑप्शन दिखाई दे रहा है। पहला डिस्कवर न्यू कीवर्ड्स, दूसरा सर्च वॉल्यूम एंड फॉरकास्ट। अब दोनों को यूज़
52:44
कैसे करना है? अगर आपके पास सिर्फ सीड कीवर्ड हैं और आपको इससे और ज्यादा
52:49
कीवर्ड्स निकालने हैं। सीड कीवर्ड से कीवर्ड बनाना है अगर तो आपको डिस्कवर न्यू कीवर्ड वाले ऑप्शन को यूज़ करना पड़ेगा। अगर
52:57
आपने किसी तरीके से ये कीवर्ड्स ऑलरेडी निकाल रखे हैं तो आप दूसरा ऑप्शन यूज़
53:02
करोगे और सर्च का वॉल्यूम और फॉरकास्ट निकाल लोगे। यानी कि आगे ट्रेंड क्या रहने वाला है? ये कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी वगैरह क्या
53:08
है? ये सब कुछ पता लग जाएगा। नाउ यहां पर थोड़ा सा एक एक एनकरेजमेंट मैं आपको देना
53:15
चाहूंगा कि आपने अभी तक सिर्फ Google सर्च को यूज़ करके कीवर्ड्स निकाले हैं सीड कीवर्ड से। लेकिन इतने से काम चलेगा नहीं
53:22
ना। हमें तो डेटा और ज्यादा चाहिए। तो हम सबसे पहले अपने इसी ऑप्शन को यूज़ करेंगे।
53:27
डिस्कवर न्यू कीवर्ड और यहां पर हमने अपने दो सीड कीवर्ड्स को कॉपी कर लिया। अगर
53:32
मेरा कैंपेन बहुत बड़ा है, मेरे पास बजट बहुत ज्यादा है, तो मैं क्या कर सकता हूं? इन कीवर्ड्स को उठाऊंगा और इन्हें यूज़
53:39
करूंगा एज सीड कीवर्ड। क्योंकि देन मुझे बहुत ज्यादा वॉल्यूम मिलेगा। बहुत सारे कीवर्ड्स मिलेंगे। बट अभी फिलहाल के लिए
53:44
ट्यूटोरियल के लिए सिर्फ इन दोनों को हमने कॉपी कर लिया। यहां पर आ गए और यहां पर हम अपने इन
53:51
दोनों सीड कीवर्ड्स को हम पेस्ट कर देते हैं। पेस्ट करने के बाद वैसे अगर आप चाहो तो यहां पर एक वेबसाइट भी ऐड कर सकते हो।
53:58
वेबसाइट का लिंक ऐड कर सकते हो। या फिर यहां पर एक दूसरा ही ऑप्शन है जो सिर्फ
54:03
आपको अपनी वेबसाइट को यूज करने का ऑप्शन देता है। यानी कि लेट्स से हमारे पास एक डेंटल की वेबसाइट है। डेंटजी डेंटल मैंने
54:10
बहुत यूज़ किया हुआ है। अ किसी दिन इनका कोई एग्जीक्यूटिव मिलेगा या अगर ऑलरेडी वो वीडियो देख रहे हैं तो भाई थैंक यू। हमने
54:17
आपकी वेबसाइट बहुत यूज़ किया। आपने हमारे स्टूडेंट्स का बहुत भला किया हुआ है। तो डेंटजी डेंटल वेबसाइट है मेरी। ऑलरेडी
54:23
पहले से वेबसाइट बनी हुई है और मैं चाहता हूं कि मुझे अपनी इस वेबसाइट के कीवर्ड निकालने हैं। तो यहां पर क्या कर सकता
54:30
हूं? यहां पर आऊंगा और यहां पर पेस्ट कर देता हूं वेबसाइट का लिंक और इसके बाद गेट रिजल्ट पे क्लिक करूंगा। तो इस वेबसाइट के
54:36
कंटेंट को स्कैन करके Google मुझे कीवर्ड बता देगा। नाउ ये इसका इंटेंडेड यूज़ है।
54:42
लेकिन हम एसइओ से इसे कैसे यूज़ करते हैं? हम कंपैटर रिसर्च के लिए यूज़ करते हैं। हमें अगर ये देखना है कि हमारा कंपैरिटर
54:49
किन-किन कीवर्ड्स को टारगेट कर रहा है। उसकी वेबसाइट किन कीवर्ड्स पे रैंक कर रही है। तो हम अपने कंपैटर की वेबसाइट का लिंक
54:54
उठाएंगे। उसे यहां पर पेस्ट करेंगे और निकाल लेंगे। लेकिन ये काम कंपैटर रिसर्च वाली क्लास में मैं आपको बताऊंगा। अभी
55:00
फिलहाल के लिए सिर्फ हम अपनी वेबसाइट के ऊपर टिक के रहते हैं। वापस आ जाते हैं स्टार्ट विद कीवर्ड्स वाली टैब। पर डेंटिस्ट डेंटल क्लनिक जो हमारे दो सीड
55:08
कीवर्ड थे वो यहां पर ऑलरेडी हैं। गेट रिजल्ट नाम के इस बटन के ऊपर क्लिक कर देते हैं एंड जस्ट वेट करते हैं। लेकिन
55:14
वेट करने के साथ ही यहां पर आपको एक और काम करना है। देखिए यहां पर एक तो थोड़ी
55:20
सी गड़बड़ हो गई है। इस वेबसाइट को भी Google यूज़ कर रहा है जो हमें नहीं करनी है। ठीक है? हम गेट रिजल्ट बटन के ऊपर
55:27
क्लिक करते हैं। इसके बाद यहां पर आपको एक दो ऑप्शन और दे रहा है। उसे हम फिल्टर करने में यूज़ करेंगे। यहां पर सबसे पहले
55:33
आपको कंट्री सेलेक्ट करने का, लोकेशन सेलेक्ट करने का ऑप्शन मिल रहा है। Google एड्स में बहुत फाइन ट्यून लोकेशन
55:39
टारगेटिंग का ऑप्शन होता है। सो यहां पर हम इस इंडिया नाम के इस पूरी एंट्री को
55:44
हटा देते हैं थोड़ी देर के लिए और यहां पर ये इमेजिन करते हैं कि लेट्स से कि आपको सिर्फ महाराष्ट्र में अपने बिज़नेस को
55:50
प्रमोट करना है। ये डेंटिस्ट की वेबसाइट है। महाराष्ट्र की बहुत बड़ी बात हो गई। आपको सिर्फ एक छोटे-मोटे एरिया में अपने
55:56
कीवर्ड को टारगेट करना होगा। तो जो भी एरिया आप टारगेट करना चाहते हो वहीं के
56:02
कीवर्ड का डेटा आपके लिए ज्यादा जरूरी है। लेट्स से कि हम यहां पर डिफिकल्टी देखते
56:07
हैं। अब डेंटिस्ट्री इस कीवर्ड की या डेंटिस्ट नियर मी जो ये कीवर्ड है इसकी जो
56:13
कंपटीशन वॉल्यूम होगा या जो कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी होगी वो दिल्ली में हाई होगी।
56:20
लेकिन किसी गांव में किसी कस्बे में कम होगी। पूरे स्टेट में हो सकता है ठीक-ठाक ना हो। तो हर जगह के हिसाब से डेटा चेंज
56:26
होता है। इसीलिए मोस्ट एक्यूरेट टारगेटिंग बहुत जरूरी है। तो यहां पर लेट्स से अगर मुझे महाराष्ट्र में सिर्फ प्रमोट करना है
56:31
तो मैं महाराष्ट्र सर्च कर लेता हूं। ये महाराष्ट्र मुझे दिखाई दे रहा है
56:37
स्टेट। मैंने यहां पर इंक्लूड कर दिया। हमारा महाराष्ट्र सेलेक्ट हो गया है। यहां पर सेव कर देता हूं। ठीक है? इसके बाद
56:43
यहां पर लैंग्वेज भी सर्च करने का ऑप्शन मिल रहा है। आपको अगर आपकी वेबसाइट या आपका जो कंटेंट है वो सिर्फ हिंदी में
56:49
होने वाला है। तो इंग्लिश लैंग्वेज में क्यों सर्च करना है? यहां पर हिंदी सेलेक्ट कर सकता हूं। बट अभी इस ट्यूटोरियल के लिए मैं इंग्लिश को ही
56:55
सेलेक्ट रहने देता हूं। और यहां पर भी वापस हम फिर से एक बार वंदे मातरम करते हैं और इंडिया पूरी कंट्री को सेलेक्ट कर
57:03
लेते हैं। हो गया सेलेक्ट एंड देन इसके बाद सेव कर लेते हैं। इसके बाद यहां पर
57:08
डेट रेंज आ रही है। यानी कि जो आप नीचे डेटा देखना चाहते हैं वो किस डेट के बीच का है? सर्च वॉल्यूम तो 1 दिन का कुछ हो
57:15
सकता है। 1 साल का कुछ हो सकता है। पूरी कायनात में जब से जब तक चल रहा है सर्च वॉल्यूम जब से Google ने ट्रैक करना शुरू
57:21
किया तब से कुछ और हो सकता है। तो यहां पर हमें डेट रेंज भी ले लेना जरूरी है। यूजुअली लास्ट जो 12 मंथ्स हैं वो अपने आप
57:27
में इनफ है। यहां पर हमारे पास दो ऑप्शन है। एक है Google एंड दूसरा है सर्च
57:33
पार्टनर। सर्च पार्टनर को सेलेक्ट नहीं करना है। Google को ही सेलेक्ट रहने देना है। ठीक है? इतना करने के बाद अब हमारे
57:40
पास नीचे यहां पर ऑप्शन आ जाता है। एक बार थोड़ी देर के लिए मैं इस इस मीटर
57:46
को हटाता हूं यहां पर। नाउ यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं कि अब आपको नीचे कीवर्ड्स का
57:51
डाटा दिखाई दे रहा है। दो तो ये डेटा दिखाई दे रहा है वो जो हमारे सीड कीवर्ड का है। डेंटिस्ट और डेंटल क्लीनिक इनकी
57:58
एवरेज मंथली सर्चेस कितनी है? 10000 से 1 मिलियन। मैंने बोला था रेंज दिखाई दे रही है। 3 मंथ का चेंज कितना है? 90% यानी कि
58:05
डेंटिस्ट नाम का जो यह एक कीवर्ड है इस कीवर्ड का अपना जो 3 मंथ्स का चेंज है वह
58:12
बढ़ रहा है या घट रहा है ये -90% यानी कि पिछले 3 महीने के कंपैरिजन में अभी के 3
58:18
महीने में 90% डिक्रीज हुआ है महाराष्ट्र में। अब महाराष्ट्र में लोग डेंटिस्ट कीवर्ड को क्यों नहीं सर्च कर रहे हैं?
58:24
अपने आप में अलग रिसर्च का विषय हो सकता है। हम इसे छोड़ देते हैं। हमारा अभी जो टॉपिक था जो अभी हमारा पर्पस था वो था
58:31
कीवर्ड्स को निकालना। तो हमने यहां पर कीवर्ड निकाल लेने हैं। वापस आते हैं डेंटिस्ट और डेंटल क्लीनिक। ये दो हमारे
58:37
सीड कीवर्ड थे। इनसे जुड़े हुए जो कीवर्ड्स हैं वो नीचे अब दिखाई दे रहे हैं। डेंटिस्ट नियर मी, डेंटल इंप्लांट,
58:43
डेंटल इंप्लांट्स नियर मी। ऑर्थोडॉन्टिस डेंटल क्लीनिक नियर मी। पीडियाट्रिक डेंटिस्ट नियर मी, टीथ व्हाइटनिंग नियर
58:49
मी, किड्स डेंटल किड्स डेंटिस्ट नियर मी। टोटल कितने कीवर्ड आईडिया हैं? 731
58:56
731। अब इन्हें एक-एक करके मैं टाइप नहीं करूंगा। यहां पर एक्सपोर्ट कर सकता हूं। हम Google शीट में एक्सपोर्ट कर लेते हैं।
59:03
यहां पर लेट्स से डेंटल क्लीनिक रिसर्च वन साथ ही में डेट डाल देते हैं 0
59:11
1 1 0 ओके ये मेरी आदत है रीनेम करने की इस तरह से। अदरवाइज मैं खुद ही भूल जाऊंगा
59:18
थोड़ी देर बाद। डॉक्यूमेंट्स को अपने रिसर्च पेपर्स को अच्छी तरीके से पहले से रीनेम करने की
59:24
हैबिट बना लीजिए। आगे चलके लाइफ बहुत आसान होगी। तो ये अभी थोड़ी देर में दूसरी टैब
59:30
पर ऑटोमेटिकली रिपोर्ट ओपन हो जाएगी। वहां से हम कॉपी और पेस्ट कर सकते हैं अपने आप। ठीक है? अभी 2 मिनट में कर लेंगे।
59:40
नाउ व्हाइल दिस रिपोर्ट इज़ गेटिंग प्रिपयर्ड। ये प्रिपेयरिंग रिपोर्ट यहां पर आपको दिखाई दे रहा है। आ गया। चलो ओपन
59:45
शीट आ गया। बट शीट को भी हम थोड़ी देर में देखते हैं। यहां पर आपको सारे के सारे अपने कीवर्ड आइडियाज के लिए डेटा पहले से
59:51
मिल रहा है। क्या मिल रहा है डेटा? एवरेज मंथली सर्चेस। एवरेज मंथली सर्चेस इन सारे वर्ड्स की कितनी है? चेंज हो रहा है।
59:58
ट्रेंड क्या है? बढ़ रही है सर्चेस या घट रही है या उतनी है? इसके बाद यहां पर क्या दिखाई दे रहा है? अच्छा ये जो सर्च का जो
1:00:05
ट्रेंड है वो 3 महीने का चेंज भी दिखाई दे रहा है और ईयर ऑन ईयर यानी कि इस पिछले 12
1:00:10
मंथ्स का जो ट्रेंड है वो उससे पहले के 12 मंथ्स के कंपैरिजन में कितना है या फिर अभी के 3 महीने का ट्रेंड पिछले 3 महीने
1:00:17
कंपैरिजन में कितना है? ये डिफरेंस आपको यहां पर दिखाई दे जाता है प्लस माइनस के जरिए। 0% का मतलब हुआ कि जितनी पहले
1:00:25
सर्चेस हो रही थी उतनी अभी भी हो रही हैं। कोई चेंज नहीं है। ठीक है? इसके बाद यहां पर कंपटीशन वैल्यू दिखाई दे रही है।
1:00:30
मीडियम, लो हाई। लो मतलब कंपटीशन बहुत ही कम है। रैंक करना आसान होगा। मीडियम मतलब
1:00:35
कंपटीशन ओके? ओके। थोड़ा फाइट मारेंगे तो जीत जाएंगे। हाई मतलब काफी ज्यादा कंपटीशन
1:00:41
है। बहुत सारे लोग उसी कीवर्ड के लिए टारगेट कर रहे हैं। थोड़ा मुश्किल हो सकती है। अगर हम एक बार ऊपर आ जाए फिर से यहां
1:00:47
डेंटिस्ट और डेंटल क्लनिक इन दोनों के लिए लो कॉमटीशन है। यानी कि रैंक करना कंपैरेटिवली ईजी है। लेकिन वॉल्यूम ज्यादा
1:00:53
है। ओके? इसके बाद यहां पर मीडियम और यहां पर हाई भी अभी अभी फिलहाल नहीं दिखाई दे
1:00:58
रहा। लेकिन अगर मैं इसे इंक्रीज़ करूंगा तो मुझे हाई कॉमटीशन वाले कुछ कीवर्ड्स भी दिखाई दे जाएंगे। ठीक है? सो अभी इसके बाद
1:01:05
यहां पर लो टॉप ऑफ द पेज बड और लो पेज बिड जो है टॉप ऑफ द पेज बिड दोनों वॉल्यूम दिखाई दे रहा है। इसके ऊपर मैं बात नहीं
1:01:11
करूंगा। अब हम आ जाते हैं वापस अपनी शीट पे जो अभी हमने ओपन की थी। यहां पर दिखाई दे रही हैं हमें कुछ चीजें। एक बार इन
1:01:18
दोनों रोज़ को डिलीट कर देता हूं। एंड वी डोंट नीड करेंसी। वी ऑलरेडी नो दैट इंडियन
1:01:23
करेंसी ही यहां पर दिखाई दे रही है। करेंसी के बाद यहां पर 3 मंथ चेंज और ईयर ऑन ईयर चेंज। इन दोनों भी कॉलम्स की हमें
1:01:30
जरूरत नहीं। इन दोनों को भी हम यहां पर हटा देते हैं। ओके? एंड देन एक बार यहां पर फिर से देख लेते हैं। सर्च वॉल्यूम में
1:01:36
फिर कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी है। मैं इसलिए यहां पर बार-बार देख रहा हूं बिकॉज़ मैं आलसी हो रहा हूं। तो मैं यहां से इन तीनों चीजों
1:01:42
को एक साथ कॉपी करूंगा। एंड देन इसके बाद पेस्ट कर दूंगा डायरेक्टली। लेट्स से अभी
1:01:47
ईजी बनाने के लिए मैं यहां से सिर्फ 100 कीवर्ड्स को पिक करता हूं। एंड देन इसके
1:01:53
बाद यहां पर पेस्ट कर देता हूं। सो मेरे पास इन 100 कीवर्ड्स का सर्च
1:02:02
वॉल्यूम भी निकल कर आ गया है और कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी भी निकल के आ गई। अब सबको दिखाई दे रहा है ये 5000 या 500 या 5000 ये सारे
1:02:09
के सारे एप्रोक्समेट नंबर है बट आपको आईडिया लग जाता है कि किसी एक पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड की सर्च वॉल्यूम ज्यादा है या कम
1:02:15
है। वापस आ जाते हैं। यहां पर हमने अभी थोड़ी देर पहले कुछ और कीवर्ड्स भी निकाले थे जो कि हमें मिले थे Google सर्च। नाउ
1:02:22
यहां पर थोड़ा सा मिसमैच हो गया। जब मैंने Google सर्च में देखा इन कीवर्ड्स को तो बिकॉज़ दिल्ली लोकेशन थी तो दिल्ली के
1:02:27
स्पेसिफिक आसपास के जो सजेशंस थे वो ज्यादा आ रहे थे। यहां पर कीवर्ड प्लानर
1:02:32
को यूज़ करते टाइम हमने पूरी इंडिया को टारगेट कर लिया था एज लोकेशन। तो इसीलिए यहां पर मुझे लोकेशन स्पेसिफिक डेली
1:02:38
स्पेसिफिक कीवर्ड्स नहीं मिल रहे हैं। नाउ इन कीवर्ड्स का भी मुझे सर्च वॉल्यूम और कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी को निकालना है। फाइंड
1:02:44
आउट करना है। तो हम एक बार आ जाते हैं फिर से Google के कीवर्ड प्लानर के अंदर।
1:02:52
नहीं फॉरकास्ट में नहीं। सो मैं एक बार फिर से Google कीवर्ड प्लानर पर जाता हूं और यहां पर गेट सर्च
1:02:59
वॉल्यूम एंड फॉरकास्ट नाम के इस बटन के ऊपर क्लिक करता हूं। अपने कीवर्ड्स को पेस्ट करता हूं। इसके बाद गेट स्टार्टेड
1:03:04
नाम के बटन के ऊपर क्लिक कर देता हूं। अब यहां पर मुझे दोबारा से एक बार अगर मैं
1:03:09
चाहूं तो मैं लैंग्वेज सेलेक्ट कर सकता हूं। कंट्री सेलेक्ट कर सकता हूं। टारगेट एरिया अपने सर्च पार्टनर को सेलेक्ट कर
1:03:15
सकता हूं। देन इसके बाद डेट रेंज को सेलेक्ट कर सकता हूं। मेरे केस में सब कुछ सेम है। तो मुझे सिर्फ यहां पर जो ये डेटा
1:03:20
अभी तक मिला है मुझे इसे एज Google शीट मैं एक बार फिर से देख लेता हूं। सो हमारे पास अभी तक कीवर्ड का डेटा आ चुका है
1:03:27
Google सर्च से और Google के कीवर्ड प्लानर से। नाउ इसके अलावा भी आप कई सारे सोर्सेस को यूज़ कर सकते हैं कीवर्ड के
1:03:32
आइडियाज को निकालने में। और इसमें हमारी जो एक अच्छी सी हेल्प कर सकता है वो है Google का सर्च कंसोल। लेकिन यह तरीका तभी
1:03:40
काम करता है जब आपने ऑलरेडी अपनी वेबसाइट को लॉन्च कर रखा है। उस वेबसाइट पर कुछ तो
1:03:45
ट्रैफिक आ रहा है। अगर कुछ ट्रैफिक ही नहीं है तो आपको नहीं मिलेगा डाटा। नाउ हमने Google सर्च कंसोल की क्लासेस ऑलरेडी
1:03:51
की हुई है। सो आई डोंट थिंक कि आपको अभी ये प्रोसेस समझने में बहुत दिक्कत होगी। लेकिन फिर भी मैं एक बार दिखा देता हूं।
1:03:57
हम जाते हैं Google के सर्च कंसोल के अंदर और सर्च कंसोल के अंदर हमने ऑलरेडी प्रॉपर्टी जो है सही सेलेक्ट कर रखी है।
1:04:04
हम आ जाते हैं सर्च रिजल्ट्स के अंदर। और सर्च के अंदर यहां आने के बाद आप देख सकते हैं कि जो क्वेरीज हैं वो आपको दिखाई दे
1:04:11
रही हैं। आपकी वेबसाइट ऑलरेडी किन क्वेरीज के लिए अपीयर हो रही है वो आपके सामने इस
1:04:17
लिस्ट को हम यहां से एक्सपोर्ट कर सकते हैं। एक्सपोर्ट वन के ऊपर क्लिक करेंगे। Google शीट्स के ऊपर क्लिक कर देते हैं और
1:04:22
आपको ये डेटा आराम से Google शीट के अंदर मिल जाएगा। नाउ यहां पर कुछ छोटे-छोटे
1:04:27
टास्क हैं जिन्हें हम करके इस डेटा को और ज्यादा रिफाइन कर सकते हैं। फॉर एग्जांपल यहां पर जो क्वेरीज आपको दिखाई दे रही हैं
1:04:33
उसमें से कुछ यूज़फुल हो सकती हैं। कुछ यूज़लेस हो सकती हैं। कुछ ऐसी भी क्वेरी होंगी जो एब्सोलुटली आपके बिज़नेस से
1:04:38
रिलेटेड नहीं है। सो क्वेरीज की रिपोर्ट यहां पर आ चुकी है। और अब यहां पर आपको दिखाई दे रही है वो क्वेरीज जो जिनके लिए
1:04:44
आपकी वेबसाइट ऑलरेडी अपीयर हो रही है। सो फॉर एग्जांपल निदा स्ट्रीट जो कि एक नेविगेशनल कीवर्ड होगा। राइट? इसके अलावा
1:04:49
हेल्दीएस्ट केक, हेल्दी केक रेसिपीज। अ ने स्ट्रीट अगेन ये एक ब्रांडेड क्वेरी ही हो
1:04:55
गई बट उसके अलावा केक्स नियर मी हेल्दीएस्ट केक टू ईट अ कुछ कीवर्ड है आई
1:05:00
डोंट नो फ्रेंच है या स्पेनिश है जिनके बारे में मैं नहीं बात करूंगा बिकॉज़ आई कांट प्रोनाउंस दी नेम्स बट देन लो कैलोरी
1:05:07
केक कस्टम केक प्राइसेस कनाडा वगैरह वगैरह इस टाइप की सारी की सारी क्वेरीज आपको दिखाई दे रही है और इस लिस्ट में से आप
1:05:13
अपने कीवर्ड्स को निकाल कर उन आइडियाज को निकाल कर अपनी लिस्ट में पेस्ट कर सकते हैं। नाउ इस मेथड को जब भी मैं एक्सप्लेन
1:05:19
करता हूं तो एक नॉर्मल सा क्वेश्चन मेरे सामने आता है कि अगर हम यहां पर किसी क्वेरी को Google सर्च कंसोल में देख रहे
1:05:25
हैं तो ऑब्वियसली Google उस क्वेरी के लिए उस कीवर्ड के लिए हमारी वेबसाइट को ऑलरेडी दिखा रहा है देन व्हाई डू वी नीड टू
1:05:31
क्रिएट द कंटेंट ऑन इट? वेल सिंपल सा आंसर है। एंड थोड़ा सा कंफ्यूजिंग हो जाता है शुरू-शुर में। जब आप किसी पेज को
1:05:37
पर्टिकुलरली राइट करते हैं। जरूरी नहीं है कि आपने जो टारगेट कीवर्ड रखा है, सिर्फ उसी कीवर्ड के लिए उस पेज को दिखाया
1:05:42
जाएगा। फॉर एग्जांपल यहां पर मैं आ जाता हूं पेजेस वाली लिस्ट के अंदर और यहां पर लेट्स से कि ये निधा स्ट्रीट साइज ऑफ़
1:05:49
केक्स इस पर्टिकुलर पेज के लिए सिर्फ मैं चेक करता हूं। इस पेज के ऊपर मैंने क्लिक कर दिया और अब मैं आ जाता हूं क्वेरीज़ के
1:05:55
लिए। तो अब ये जो एक पर्टिकुलर पेज है निधा स्ट्रीट डॉट सीए सश आई थिंक इसका जो
1:06:00
यूआरएल है वो है साइज़ ऑफ़ केक। ओके? अब ये किन-किन कीवर्ड्स के लिए किन-किन क्वेरीज़ के लिए Google सर्च में दिखाया जा रहा है?
1:06:07
बर्थडे केक साइज, रेक्टेंगल केक साइज, केक साइज, केक साइज फॉर 20 पीपल, बर्थडे केक साइज, साइज ऑफ केक। हाउ बिग केक फॉर 20
1:06:14
पीपल। ये सारे के सारे कीवर्ड टारगेट नहीं किए गए होंगे। लेकिन Google अलग-अलग क्वेरीज के लिए हमारी वेबसाइट को सूटेबल
1:06:20
मानता है। इसीलिए वहां पर दिखा रहा है। नाउ लेट्स से कि यहां पर मैं बार-बार क्वेरी देख रहा हूं बर्थडे केक साइज या
1:06:27
बिग केक साइज या केक साइज फॉर 20 पीपल। तो यहां से अगर मैं एक आईडिया लेता हूं कि हो
1:06:32
सकता है इनकी ज्योग्राफिक लोकेशन में 20 लोग एक कॉमन क्वेरी है जिसके लिए लोग केक साइज पूछते हैं। 20 इज द एवरेज पार्टी
1:06:39
साइज। तो अब अगर मैं अपनी वेबसाइट पर एक पेज बनाता हूं बर्थडे केक फॉर 20 पीपल या
1:06:45
आइडियल केक साइज फॉर 20 पीपल। देन उस पर्टिकुलर पेज के इस क्वेरी के लिए रैंक
1:06:51
करने के चांसेस बढ़ जाते हैं। अगर आप यहां पर अभी देखें कि केक साइज फॉर 20 पीपल। इस पर्टिकुलर क्वेरी के लिए सर्चेस कितनी है?
1:06:57
1000 एंड क्लिक कितनी बार हुआ है? टू। यानी कि जो एवरेज रैंक होगी वो बहुत कम
1:07:02
है। क्यों? बिकॉज़ यहां पर इस पेज को 20 लोगों वाली जो क्वेरी है उसके लिए नहीं बनाया गया। इस पेज पर जो कंटेंट है वह सभी
1:07:09
साइज़ज़ के लिए बात कर रहा है। सो, ऑलदो Google के पास क्वेरी है। ऑलदो Google को
1:07:14
लग रहा है कि हमारी वेबसाइट इस पर्टिकुलर क्वेरी के लिए रैंक कराई जा सकती है। अच्छी है, वर्दी है। लेकिन बिकॉज़ हमारे
1:07:21
पास कोई डेडिकेटेड पेज नहीं है। इसीलिए यह पर्टिकुलर जो हमारा पेज है वो अच्छा नहीं रैंक कर
1:07:27
रहा है। ज्यादा नहीं रैंक कर रहा है। यहां पर अगर हमारे पास एक पेज होता है जो 20 लोगों के लिए बर्थडे केक साइज के बारे में
1:07:32
इनफार्मेशन देता है। तो ये जो 1000 इंपेशंस हैं ये 200 क्लिक्स में भी
1:07:38
कन्वर्ट हो सकते हैं। 200 क्लिक्स होंगे टू से 200 पे क्लिक्स होंगे। यानी कि 198 मोर क्लिक्स हमें मिल जाएंगे सिर्फ एक
1:07:44
कीवर्ड की वजह से। और कीवर्ड रिसर्च का पर्पस भी यही होता है कि हम ज्यादा से ज्यादा कीवर्ड के लिए ज्यादा से ज्यादा
1:07:51
क्वेरीज के लिए Google सर्च में अपीयर हो। हमारा ट्रैफिक बढ़े। राइट? सो इसी तरह से हम भी अपनी डेंटल वेबसाइट के Google सर्च
1:07:56
कंसोल को जाकर देखेंगे और जितनी भी यहां पर क्वेरीज दिखाई दे रही हैं उन क्वेरीज को इस तरह से एक्सपोर्ट कर लेंगे सिंपली।
1:08:03
एंड देन यहां से कॉपी करेंगे और अपनी शीट में पेस्ट कर देंगे। नाउ यहां पर कई बार ऐसा भी होता है कि आपकी वेबसाइट पुरानी
1:08:09
है। यहां पर आपको बहुत सारे अलग-अलग कीवर्ड्स देखने को मिल रहे हैं। आप चाहते हो कि सिर्फ इनेशनल जो कीवर्ड है वही आपको
1:08:15
देखने को मिले। बाकी इधर-उधर कीवर्ड से आपका कोई मतलब नहीं है। सो, हम एक छोटी सी ट्रिक है जिसे यूज़ कर सकते हैं। हम यहां
1:08:20
पर ऐड फ़िल्टर नाम के इस बटन के ऊपर क्लिक कर लेते हैं। और इसके बाद क्वेरी के ऊपर क्लिक करते हैं। और यहां पर आने के बाद
1:08:26
क्वेरी कंटेनिंग की जगह कस्टम रिजेक्स इस ऑप्शन को सेलेक्ट कर लेते हैं। एंड देन यहां पर हम एंटर करेंगे व्हाट?
1:08:32
हाउ व्हाई व्हेन वेयर ओके बीच-बीच में
1:08:38
पाइप लगा रहे हैं। व्हाट पाइप हाउ पाइप व्हाई पाइप व्हेन पाइप वेयर यानी कि हम
1:08:45
Google सर्च कंसोल को एक हिंट दे रहे हैं कि हमारी वेबसाइट जितनी भी क्वेरीज़ के लिए
1:08:51
रैंक कर रही है, इंप्रेशन मिल रहा है, क्लिक मिल रहा है, उनमें से वह सारी क्वेरीज़ निकाल दो जिसमें कहीं ना कहीं
1:08:56
व्हाट, हाउ, व्हाई, वेयर और व्हेन है। जितने भी क्वेश्चंस होते हैं वो सभी
1:09:02
इन्हीं वर्ड्स के साथ में बनाए जाते हैं। ओके? एंड देन जितनी भी क्वेरीज इनफेशनल क्वेरीज हैं, वो हमेशा क्वेश्चन के
1:09:08
फॉर्मेट में ही होती हैं। तो हम यहां पर अप्लाई बटन के ऊपर क्लिक कर देते हैं। एंड देन इसके बाद हम नीचे आकर देखेंगे यहां पर
1:09:14
क्वेरीज आपको वो सारी मिलेंगी जो कि इनेशनल क्वेरी हैं। व्हाट इज द हेल्दीियस्ट केक टू ईट? व्हाट इज द
1:09:19
हेल्दीियस्ट केक? व्हाट इज द हेल्दीएस्ट टाइप ऑफ़ केक? व्हाट साइज केक फॉर 30 गेस्ट? हाउ मेनी कैलोरीज़ इन एंजेल फूड
1:09:26
केक? हाउ टू नो व्हेन ब्राउनीज़ आर डन? इस तरह की जो इंफॉर्मेशनेशनल क्वेरीज हैं वो
1:09:31
आपको आपके सामने दिखाई देंगी। आप डिसाइड कर सकते हैं इनमें से किस पर्टिकुलर क्वेरी के लिए आपको लिखना है करना है।
1:09:38
यहां पर एग्जैक्ट क्वेश्चंस हैं। इन्हीं एक-एक क्वेश्चन के लिए उठाकर आप एक-एक पेज बना सकते हैं और आपका पेज ऐसे ही रैंक
1:09:43
करना शुरू कर जाएगा। ओके? सो हम वापस आते हैं अपने कीवर्ड रिसर्च के। छोटी-छोटी ट्रिक्स हैं जो आप यूज़ कर सकते हैं। नाउ
1:09:50
यहां पर हमें दिखाई दे रहा है अपना कीवर्ड जो हमारे पास लिस्ट आ चुकी है। उसके अलावा है हमारे पास सर्च वॉल्यूम जो कुछ
1:09:55
कीवर्ड्स के लिए कुछ कीवर्ड्स के लिए नहीं है। दिस इज़ अ ट्यूटोरियल। तो एक काम करते हैं। इसको हम यहां पर पेस्ट कर देते हैं।
1:10:01
एंड देन इन सारे कीवर्ड्स को हटा देते हैं। अभी फिलहाल के लिए डिलीट रोज़। नाउ हमारे पास जो ये लिस्ट है वो काफी वेरीरी
1:10:08
कर रही है। कभी 5000 है, कभी 50 लाख है। तो हम एक काम करते हैं। इस रो को फ्रीज़ कर
1:10:13
देते हैं। देन इसके बाद इसको जरा सा डिसेंडिंग ऑर्डर
1:10:20
में सॉर्ट कर लेते हैं। सो अब हमें पता लग रहा है कि हमारे कौन से कीवर्ड हैं जिनके ऊपर सबसे ज्यादा सर्च वॉल्यूम है एंड देन
1:10:25
इसके बाद वो डिसेंडिंग ऑर्डर में आपको दिखाई दे रहा है। लेट्स से किसी एक पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड के लिए सिर्फ 50 की सर्च
1:10:31
है। इट्स फाइन। यू कैन यू कैन इग्नोर इट। नाउ साथ ही में आपको कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी भी मिल रही है। यह कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी सिर्फ
1:10:37
लो, मीडियम और हाई में है। बिकॉज़ Google एड्स हमें इतनी इंफॉर्मेशनेशन देता है। इसके बाद हमारे पास इंटेंट का एक बॉक्स
1:10:44
दिखाई दे रहा है। इंटेंट यानी कि ये पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड जो है इसका इंटेंट क्या है? इंटेंट हमारे पास तीन टाइप के हैं।
1:10:50
इनेशनल, नेविगेशनल और कमर्शियल। कमर्शियल के साथ में ट्रांजैक्शनल भी कहा जाता है। नाउ इसके बाद हमारे पास लेंथ है और ट्रेंड
1:10:57
है। नाउ इंटेंट पर आने से पहले एक बार हम लेंथ को सॉर्ट आउट कर लेते हैं। यहां पर डेंटिस्ट वर्ड सिर्फ एक वर्ड वाला है। ठीक
1:11:06
है? इसके बाद डेंटल क्लीनिक कीवर्ड दो वर्ड का है। इसके बाद डेंटिस्ट नियर मी
1:11:12
तीन वर्ड का है। नाउ ये प्रोसेस अपने आप पे थोड़ी टीरियस हो सकती है। बिकॉज़ आपको हर एक कीवर्ड को पढ़ना पड़ेगा। इसके बाद काउंट करना पड़ेगा। सो हम एक फार्मूला लगा
1:11:18
लेते हैं। यहां पर अ फार्मूला मैं यहां पर पेस्ट कर रहा हूं। नाउ यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं हमारा जो फ़ूला है वो है काउंट A
1:11:25
स्प्लिट B5 B5 इसलिए कर रहे हैं क्योंकि ये जो कीवर्ड है मेरा वो B रो में आता है
1:11:30
फाइव में आता है ओके फिफ्थ रो में है और बी कॉलम में है। सो आपका कीवर्ड जिस भी कॉलम में आप इस हिसाब से फार्मूला को अपने
1:11:37
चेंज कर सकते हैं। एक बार ये यहां पर हमने एक पे लगा दिया। इसके बाद हम सभी पर इंप्लीमेंट कर देते हैं। एंड अब हमारे पास
1:11:43
सारे जितने भी कीवर्ड्स हैं उन सभी की लेंथ यहां पर आपको दिखाई दे रही है। फोर है, थ्री है, फाइव है। नाउ इस क्लास की
1:11:49
शुरुआत में ही हमने बात की थी कि जब आप करियर शुरू कर रहे हैं, जब आप अभी शुरुआती फज़ में जहां पर आप बहुत ज्यादा टफ
1:11:55
कीवर्ड्स के पीछे नहीं जाना चाहते हैं, तो आप ऐसे कीवर्ड्स को सेलेक्ट करेंगे जिनमें तीन से लेकर छह वर्ड्स के बीच में ही लेंथ
1:12:01
आती है। तो, अब हम यहां पर इस पूरी की पूरी शीट को ज़रा
1:12:06
दोबारा से एक बार सॉर्ट कर लेते हैं। Z टू A. सो हमारे पास यह सात वर्ड्स वाला
1:12:13
कीवर्ड है। पांच है, चार है, तीन है। एंड देन इसके बाद तीन से नीचे दो। तो जितने भी
1:12:19
हमारे ऐसे कीवर्ड्स हैं जिनमें दो वर्ड ही हैं उन्हें हम यहां से अभी के लिए रिमूव
1:12:24
कर देते हैं। ओके? आइडियल सिचुएशन क्या होगी कि आप इसे डिलीट ना करें और आप इन
1:12:29
वर्ड्स को यूज़ करके और दूसरी टैब बना लें। सो लेट्स से हम यहां से कॉपी करते हैं एंड
1:12:36
चार तीन दो। सो तीन तक के हमने सारे कीवर्ड्स यहां से उठाए। एक नई शीट बनाई और
1:12:42
यहां पर पेस्ट कर दिया। ठीक है? व्हाई? बिकॉज़ अब क्या होगा कि यहां पर ये जो बाकी पूरा डेटा है वो डिलीट नहीं होगा। आपने इस
1:12:48
डेटा को भी निकालने में टाइम लगाया है। सो डोंट डिलीट इट। ठीक है? दूसरी टैब पे बना
1:12:54
लेते हैं। काम हमारा चल रहा है। ठीक है? सो अब हमारे पास ऐसे कीवर्ड्स हैं जिनकी लेंथ तीन से ज्यादा है और छह से ज्यादा
1:13:03
नहीं है। एक ये सात वाला है जिसको डिलीट करता हूं अभी। अगेन आपको डिलीट नहीं करना है। सिर्फ अपने पास सेव रखना है। कहीं भी
1:13:08
कॉपी करके सेव कर लो। सो एक बार फिर से हम सर्च वॉल्यूम के बेस पर इस शीट को सॉर्ट
1:13:13
कर लेते हैं। Z टू A ठीक है? ये सारे के सारे कीवर्ड्स जिन्हें हम टारगेट करने जा रहे हैं। अब यहां पर कुछ ऐसे कीवर्ड्स भी
1:13:20
होंगे जिनमें सर्च वॉल्यूम हाई है। ठीक है? इन्हें कैसे आइडेंटिफाई करते हैं? यहां पर हम एक फ़िल्टर लगा देते हैं।
1:13:26
क्रिएट अ फ़िल्टर। फ़िल्टर के ऊपर क्लिक करते हैं। एंड देन यहां पर ट लो, मीडियम
1:13:31
ये सब कुछ हटा लेते हैं। अननोन हटा लिया हमने। सिर्फ हाई वाले बचा के रख लेते हैं। ठीक है? ये हैं वो पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड जिनको
1:13:37
हम टारगेट नहीं करेंगे। ये हाई में है। इनको हटा देते हैं। हम डिलीट कर देते हैं अगेन। एंड देन इसके बाद फ़्टर को यहां से
1:13:42
रिमूव कर देते हैं। हमारे पास वो सारे कीवर्ड आ गए हैं जिनमें सर्च वॉल्यूम अभी हमने सर्च वॉल्यूम को नहीं देखा है। लेकिन
1:13:49
जिनमें जो कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी है वो मीडियम है और लो है। हाई नहीं है। किसी में ज्यादा स्ट्रगल नहीं करना पड़ेगा। और जो
1:13:55
कीवर्ड की लेंथ है वो भी तीन से लेकर छ के बीच में है। अब एक बार फिर से हम सर्च वॉल्यूम के बेस पर भी इसको सॉर्ट कर लेते
1:14:01
हैं। Z टू A यहां पर 5 लाख वाले भी हैं, 500 वाले भी हैं एंड देन 50 वाले भी हैं।
1:14:06
अब ये 50 वाले कुछ ज्यादा ही हमें परेशान करेंगे। ज्यादा ही हमारा टाइम खाएंगे और उसमें ज्यादा रिजल्ट नहीं मिलने वाला है।
1:14:13
तो 50 वाले जितने भी हैं इन्हें मैं डिलीट कर लेता हूं। ओके? अगेन मैं डिलीट कर रहा हूं ट्यूटोरियल में। आपको डिलीट नहीं करना
1:14:18
है। सिर्फ जिनको यूज़ कर रहे हैं उसको दूसरी टैब पर डालते जाओ। ओके? एंड देन इसके बाद यहां पर हमारे पास ऐसे कीवर्ड्स
1:14:24
आ गए हैं और इन कीवर्ड्स का नंबर है 38। 38 कीवर्ड्स ऐसे हैं जिनमें कीवर्ड डिफिकल्टी मीडियम या लो है जिनमें सर्च
1:14:31
वॉल्यूम 50 से ऊपर है और जिसकी जो लेंथ है वो तीन से लेकर छह के बीच में है। अब यहां
1:14:38
पर आ जाते हैं इंटेंट के ऊपर। क्या है इसका इंटेंट? क्या ये कमर्शियल है या ये
1:14:43
ट्रांजैक्शनल है या इनेशनल है? ओके। सो यहां पर हमारे पास आ गया डेंटल क्लीनिक नियर मी। ये कैसा कीवर्ड है?
1:14:49
ट्रांजैक्शनल। ओके? डेंटिस्ट नियर मी ये कैसा कीवर्ड है? ये भी ट्रांजैक्शनल है। पीडियाट्रिक डेंटिस्ट नियर मी ये भी
1:14:56
ट्रांजैक्शनल है। क्योंकि इन सब में नियर मी लगा है। जितने भी नियर मी वाले कीवर्ड हैं इन सभी को हम ट्रांजैक्शनल क्वेरी में
1:15:02
ही डालेंगे। स्माइल डेंटल कनिक ये कैसा कीवर्ड है? ये हमारा नेविगेशनल कीवर्ड है। ठीक है? अब नेविगेशनल कीवर्ड में भी ये
1:15:09
ध्यान रखो कि स्माइल डेंटल क्लीनिक अगर आपका अपना खुद का ब्रांड नेम है तो आप स्माइल डेंटल क्लीनिक को आराम से रख सकते
1:15:16
हो। अगर आपका नहीं है तो हटा दो। या अगर क्लाइंट यह कह रहा है कि भाई मेरे कंपैरिटर के पास बहुत सारा ट्रैफिक जाता
1:15:22
है और आपको कंपैटर का ट्रैफिक ही उड़ाना है तो आप इसे अपनी कीवर्ड रिसर्च वाली शीट में बना के रख सकते हो। बिकॉज़ आप अपने
1:15:28
कंटेंट में स्माइल डेंटल क्लीनिक के बारे में लिखो। बताओ लिस्टिकल बनाओ कि ये लिस्ट
1:15:34
यहां पे इस पर्टिकुलर एरिया में टॉप 10 डेंटिस्ट है। स्माइल डेंटल क्लनिक फर्स्ट पोजीशन पे नहीं है। वो कहीं सात आठ पे है।
1:15:39
हमारा क्लनिक ज्यादा आगे है। आपको यूजर को समझाने की जरूरत नहीं है। Google को समझा दो। अपने आप ही Google आपके क्लनिक को
1:15:46
ज्यादा बेटर रैंक करेगा। ठीक है? सिमिलरली यहां पर डेंटल क्लीनिक कॉस्ट। अब ये कॉस्ट आ गया यहां पर वर्ड। कॉस्ट का मतलब क्या
1:15:52
है? ये कमर्शियल कीवर्ड है। ठीक है? इसके बाद ऑल ऑन फोर डेंटल इंप्लांट। ये भी
1:15:58
कमर्शियल कीवर्ड है। डेंटल इंप्लांट्स नियर मी ये भी कैसा कीवर्ड है? ट्रांजैक्शनल है। अगेन सो इस तरीके से
1:16:05
आपको अपने सारे कीवर्ड्स के लिए अ क्लासिफिकेशन करना पड़ेगा कि उसका इंटेंट
1:16:11
क्या है? ट्रांजैक्शन है, नेविगेशनल है, इनेशनल है। नाउ यहां पर एक चीज़ ध्यान देनी है कि ये प्रोसेस अपने आप में टीडीएस हो
1:16:17
सकती है। 50 100 हैं। वैसे शुरुआती फेस में आप अपने हाथ से करो ज्यादा अच्छा है। बट अगर आप थक रहे हो और आपके पास बहुत
1:16:24
ज्यादा टाइम नहीं है या आपको जल्दी-जल्दी काम करना है। आपने ये ऑलरेडी सीख लिया है कि कोई कीवर्ड ट्रांजैक्शन है, कमर्शियल है, क्या है? आपको पहचान है। अब बार-बार
1:16:31
इस प्रोसेस को अपने आप से नहीं करना चाहते हो तो आप जा सकते हो चैट, जीपीटी टाइप के किसी भी टूल के ऊपर। बिकॉज़ ये मॉडल्स हैं।
1:16:38
लार्ज लैंग्वेज मॉडल हैं। ये कंटेंट को यह वर्ड को लैंग्वेज को बड़ी अच्छी तरीके से
1:16:43
समझ लेते हैं। सो हम यहां पर आ जाते हैं अपनी शीट पे और इन पूरी के पूरे लिस्ट को
1:16:49
कॉपी कर लेते हैं। एंड देन यहां पर हम चैट जीपीटी से ही पूछ लेते हैं कि कैटेगराइज
1:16:55
दीज़ कीवर्ड्स इंटू फॉर
1:17:03
ग्रुप्स नेविगेशनल इंफॉर्मेशनल
1:17:11
कमर्शियल एंड ट्रांजैक्शनल
1:17:17
बेस्ड ऑन देयर सर्च इंटेंट।
1:17:23
ओके? आपको सिर्फ ये मैसेज पेस्ट करना है। एंड देन इसके बाद यहां पर Google एंड देन
1:17:29
इसके बाद चैट जीपीटी या क्लॉड या जेमिनाई जो भी आप यूज़ कर रहे हैं वो इन कीवर्ड्स को इनकी इंटेंट के बेस पर ब्रेकडाउन कर
1:17:36
देगा। यहां पर आपको कॉपी करना है और अपनी लिस्ट में उस इंटेंट को पेस्ट करते जाना है। ओके नाउ लेट्स से कि हमने इस अभी
1:17:44
फिलहाल के लिए मैं इसी सारी की सारी लिस्ट को ऐसे ही पेस्ट कर देता हूं।
1:17:52
कोई भी इनफेशनल कीवर्ड छोड़ा ही नहीं मैंने। है ना? हो सकता है कई बार आप रिसर्च करोगे कोई एक खास इंटेंट नहीं मिल
1:17:58
रही। इट्स फाइन। नाउ अब आपके पास कुछ कीवर्ड्स दिखाई दे रहे हैं ट्रांजैक्शन। कुछ कीवर्ड दिखा रहे हैं कमर्शियल। कुछ
1:18:04
कीवर्ड्स दिखाई दे रहे हैं जो है नेविगेशनल इनेशनल है। अब ये आपके प्लान के ऊपर डिपेंड करता है कि अभी राइट नाउ व्हाट
1:18:10
डू यू वांट टू डू। क्लाइंट आपके पास आया है। सबसे पहले आप ट्रांजैक्शनल कीवर्ड को ही टारगेट कर लो। क्योंकि अगर कीवर्ड
1:18:15
ट्रांजैक्शनल है उसके ऊपर आप थोड़ा सा काम करोगे। उन क्वेरीज के लिए आपकी वेबसाइट रैंक करना शुरू कर देगी। क्लाइंट के पास
1:18:21
बिज़नेस आना शुरू हो जाएगा। या फिर क्लाइंट का एकद महीना हो चुका है। ठीक है? आप ट्रांजैक्शनल क्वेरीज के लिए ऑलरेडी रैंक
1:18:27
करते हो। आप इनेशनल कंटेंट को पकड़ो। अभी हम लोग जब कॉन्टेंट टाइप के ऊपर आएंगे तो वहां पर हम देखेंगे टोफू मोफू बोफू तीनों
1:18:34
अलग-अलग फेजेस को देखेंगे जहां पर हम समझेंगे कि ये जो ट्रांजैक्शनल है या इनफार्मेशनल है या नेविगेशनल कॉन्टेंट है
1:18:40
ये उस पूरी की पूरी मार्केटिंग की जो फनल है उसमें कहां पर बैठता है लेकिन अभी
1:18:45
फिलहाल के लिए कीवर्ड रिसर्च के लिए इतना इनफ हो जाएगा। सो हमारे पास इंटेंट आ गई है। अब हमें देखना है कि ट्रेंड क्या है
1:18:51
इस पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड का। तो लेट्स से डेंटल क्लीनिक नियर मी इस पर्टिकुलर वर्ड को मैंने उठाया और इसके बाद मैं ओपन करता
1:18:57
हूं ट्रेंड्स डॉट google.com सो हम आ चुके हैं Google
1:19:03
ट्रेंड्स पर और Google ट्रेंड्स पर हम आने के बाद अपने इस क्वेरी को एक बार सर्च
1:19:09
करते हैं। डेंटल क्लीनिक नियर मी। ठीक है? एक्सप्लोर बटन के ऊपर क्लिक कर देते हैं। लेट्स वेट फॉर द रिजल्ट्स। एंड यहां पर
1:19:15
इंडिया पास डे का दिखाई दे रहा है। थोड़ा सा हम चेंज करते हैं इसे। अ लेट्स से मुझे महाराष्ट्र में ही सर्च करना है।
1:19:23
इंडिया महाराष्ट्र एंड देन पास्ट डे नहीं पास्ट 12 मंथ्स को देखते हैं। ओके? एंड
1:19:29
देन इसके बाद लेट्स दिस लेट दिस ट्रेंड कम इन। राइट? अब यहां पर सर्च वॉल्यूम आपको
1:19:34
नहीं दिखाई दे रहा है। लेकिन आपको यह पता लग रहा है कि पिछले 12 महीने में जो ये क्वेरी है डेंटल क्लीनिक नियर मी ये स्टडी
1:19:41
डिमांड में है। थोड़ा सा हल्का सा डिक्लाइन है। बट ये दिस इज़ ओके। ये बीच में कभी कबभार आ जाता है। तो यहां पर इस
1:19:47
तरीके से आपको एक एक चार्ट में पता लग रहा है कि Google के पास महाराष्ट्र रीजन में
1:19:53
डेंटल क्लीनिक नियर मी कीवर्ड की डिमांड कैसी है। स्टेडी है। मोर और लेस स्टेडी
1:19:58
है। यहां पर कुछ है 5% का 10% का डिक्लाइन है। बट स्टिल ये कीवर्ड अपने आप में
1:20:04
स्टेडी है। तो हम यहां पर कर देते हैं। ट्रेंड क्या है? स्टेडी। ओके? दूसरा कीवर्ड उठाता हूं। एंड देन
1:20:12
इसके बाद इसको भी यहां पर सर्च करता हूं। डेंटिस नियर मी इसकी जो सर्चेस हैं वो भी
1:20:20
मोर और लेस सेम है। यहां बीच में एक बार स्पाइक आया था बट उसके अलावा स्टेडी है। तो यहां पर भी आकर मैं दोबारा से लिख देता
1:20:26
हूं। ट्रेंड क्या है? स्टेडी। ठीक है? पीडियाट्रिक डेंटिस्ट नियर मी। इसको भी एक
1:20:31
बार सर्च करके देखते हैं। डोंट वरी। सारे कीवर्ड्स को एक-एक करके सर्च नहीं करूंगा। इट्स स्टिल अ ट्यूटोरियल। द प्रोसेस विल
1:20:36
बी डन बाय यू। पीडिएट्रिक डेंटिस्ट नियर मी। अब यहां पर क्या है कि एक बार ये 100 तक पहुंचा एंड देन इसके बाद
1:20:43
डेड है। ओके? तो अब इसका कोई ट्रेंड नहीं है अपने आप में। इसका मतलब है कि सर्च वॉल्यूम
1:20:49
बहुत कम है। और हम अगर यहां पर आकर देखें तो सर्च वॉल्यूम आपको डेंटिस्ट नियर मी या पीडियाट्रिक डेंटिस्ट नियर मी इसके
1:20:55
कंपैरिजन में बहुत कम दिखाई दे रहा है। ओके? सो इसका मतलब यहां पर इनकंक्लूसिव है। एनए डाल देते हैं। हमें कुछ नहीं
1:21:02
मिला। या ऑलदो यहां पर एक बार यह दिखाई दिया है जंप इस तरीके का बट Google की
1:21:07
अपनी गाइडलाइन है कि जब भी Google ट्रेंड में किसी भी सर्च क्वेरी के लिए इस तरीके
1:21:13
से ग्राफ दिखाई दे जहां पर एकदम कंप्लीटली एक स्पाइक आए और चला गया इसका मतलब ये है
1:21:18
कि Google के पास इनफ डेटा नहीं है। Google ट्रेंड सिस्टम में इनफ डेटा नहीं है। सो दे कांट एक्चुअली मेक दी जजमेंट।
1:21:25
सो ये इस इस ग्राफ को हम कंप्लीटली नेगलेक्ट कर देंगे। ओके? इसका मतलब है दिस इज एब्सोलुटली ट्रैश राइट।
1:21:32
इसका मतलब है कि Google ट्रेंड्स का यह डाटा ट्रस्टवर्दी नहीं है। इस कीवर्ड के लिए हम इसे इग्नोर कर देंगे। आते हैं एक
1:21:38
और कीवर्ड को लेते हैं। टीथ क्लीनिंग नियर मी एंड बस आई प्रॉमिस सिर्फ एक और क्वेरी को हम इस तरह से देखेंगे। टीथ क्लीनिंग
1:21:45
नियर मी। और यहां पर आप देख सकते हो कि यहां पे भी जंप सा आ रहा है। ओके? जब भी इस तरह के ये ये कभी कबभार आने वाले जंप
1:21:51
दिखाई देते हैं। इसका मतलब है Google ट्रेंड्स के पास में इनफ डेटा नहीं है। अगेन हम एनए कर देते हैं यहां पर। ओके?
1:21:58
डिसरेज होने की जरूरत नहीं है। अगर हमें कोई एक ऐसा कीवर्ड मिलता है जिसकी सर्च वॉल्यूम सडनली बहुत ज्यादा ड्रॉप हो रहे
1:22:04
हैं। फॉर एग्जांपल लेट्स से कोई एक हम कीवर्ड ऐसा लेते हैं जिसमें बहुत ज्यादा सर्चेस नहीं दिखाई देती हैं। चीप डेंटिस्ट
1:22:10
नियर मी यहां पर आ जाते हैं। एंड देन चीप डेंटिस्ट नियर मी सर्च करते हैं। अब यहां पर भी ओवरऑल Google ट्रेंड्स के पास डेटा
1:22:17
नहीं है। अपने आप ही बता रहे हैं कि हमारे पास इनफ डेटा नहीं है। सो हम यहां पर आने के बाद वापस एनए कर देंगे। ठीक है? लेकिन
1:22:23
अगर किसी भी कीवर्ड के लिए आपको अचानक से डिक्लाइन होता दिखाई देता है। फॉर एग्जांपल यहां पर एक बार मैं डिक्लाइन वाला ग्राफ दिखा देता हूं कैसा होता है। अ
1:22:30
आई विल सर्च फैक्स मशीन। ओके? अब फैक्स मशीन को तो बहुत सारे
1:22:36
लोग नहीं सर्च करते हैं। तो यहां पर मैं एक बार इसको एंटायर इंडिया सेलेक्ट कर लेता हूं। और यहां पर हम कर लेते हैं पूरा
1:22:42
जितना ओवर द पीरियड ऑफ़ टाइम डेटा हो सकता है। अभी देखो यहां पर क्या है? फैक्स मशीन की ऑब्वियसली रिक्वायरमेंट कम हो रही है।
1:22:48
2004 के कंपैरिजन में धीरे-धीरे धीरे-धीरे डिमांड डेड हो रही है। अब किसी को फैक्स मशीन की जरूरत नहीं है ईमेल के जमाने में।
1:22:54
अगर आपको किसी भी पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड के लिए इस तरीके का ग्राफ देखने को मिलता है जहां पर डिमांड कभी हुआ करती थी 12 महीने पहले
1:23:01
और अब वो खत्म होती जा रही है। इसका मतलब है कि उस कीवर्ड को हमें टच नहीं करना है। हो सकता है उसका वॉल्यूम अभी अच्छा दिखाई
1:23:08
दे रहा है। हो सकता है उसका वॉल्यूम अभी आपको 5000 दिखाई दे रहा है। लेकिन अगर इस तरह की जब भी आपको ग्राफ दिखाई दे तो हम
1:23:14
इसको यहां पर डिक्लाइनिंग दे देते हैं। ठीक है? तो अगर सर्च वॉल्यूम अभी ओकेओके है जो कंपटीशन है वो भी लो है लेकिन अगर
1:23:22
उसकी जो उसका ट्रेंड है वो डिक्लाइन पे है तो फिर उसके ऊपर काम नहीं करना है क्योंकि
1:23:27
बाय द टाइम आप कंटेंट पब्लिश करोगे कुछ बहुत बैकलिंकिंग करोगे कंटेंट रैंक करना शुरू करेगा तब तक तो उसकी डिमांड खत्म हो
1:23:33
जाएगी तो ऐसे कीवर्ड्स के ऊपर हम काम नहीं करते हैं। ठीक है? नाओ यहां पर हमने
1:23:38
डिक्लाइनिंग वाला हटा दिया। तो हम एक तरह से इन सारे के सारे कीवर्ड्स को इसी तरह से चेक करते हैं Google ट्रेंड्स पर। और
1:23:45
जब हम सेम रश वगैरह पर देखेंगे तो आपको पता लगेगा वहां पर थोड़े से टूल एडवांस होते हैं। वहां पर यह सारी चीजें अपने आप
1:23:50
ही बता देता है। निकाल कर आपको इतनी मेहनत नहीं करनी पड़ती है। बट अगर आपके पास सेम रश नहीं है तो इस प्रोसेस को अभी हम फ्री
1:23:56
में भी ऐसे ही कर सकते हैं। एंड ट्रस्ट मी सेम रश जो डाटा आपको देता है आप उसका
1:24:01
भरोसा कर सकते हैं चाहें तो। क्योंकि उनके पास इनफर्ड डेटा होता है। उन्हें अलग-अलग
1:24:07
सोर्सेस से डेटा मिल रहा है। Google अपना डेटा नहीं बेचता है। लेकिन जब Google कहता है कि इस पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड का सर्च
1:24:13
वॉल्यूम ज्यादा है या इसके लिए कंटेंट या इसके लिए कंपटीशन कम है या फिर इसकी
1:24:19
डिमांड बढ़ रही है या स्टेडी है। इसका मतलब है कि वो एक्चुअली में ऐसा है। बिकॉज़ लोग Google पर जाकर सर्च करते हैं। Samsh
1:24:25
पर सर्च नहीं करते हैं। लोग कहां सर्च करते हैं? Google पर। तो ये इनफेशन फर्स्ट हैंड किसके पास है? Google के पास है। सो
1:24:31
अगर Google कह रहा है कि इस पर्टिकुलर कीवर्ड के लिए सर्च वॉल्यूम ज्यादा है इसका मतलब है ज्यादा है। राइट? कई बार ये
1:24:37
क्वेश्चन आता है कि सर सेमरश हमारे सर्च वॉल्यूम ज्यादा बता रहा है। Google कम बता रहा है। वेल Google की बात मानो। क्योंकि
1:24:43
लोग Google पर सर्च कर रहे हैं। Samsh पर कौन जाकर सर्च कर रहा है? Samsh पर सिर्फ जो एसइओस हैं वही यूज़ कर रहे हैं।
1:24:48
मार्केटर्स यूज़ कर रहे हैं। कस्टमर कहां जा रहा है? आपको मार्केटर्स को बेचना है या फिर बेचना है कस्टमर्स को। सो कस्टमर्स
1:24:54
जहां पर हैं उस डेटा को आपको ज्यादा प्रेफरेंस देना चाहिए। सो अब यहां पर हम इस तरीके से काम करते रहेंगे तो हमारे पास
1:25:01
एक ये शीट बन जाएगी जिसमें हमारे अपने कीवर्ड्स हैं। हमारे उन कीवर्ड्स का सर्च
1:25:07
वॉल्यूम है। उनकी डिफिकल्टी है। उनका इंटेंट है। उनकी लेंथ है और वो स्टेडी है
1:25:13
या ग्रो हो रही है डिमांड या नहीं ग्रो हो रही है वगैरह-वगैरह। सो अब यहां पर अगेन मैं एक बार बना सकता हूं फ़्टर। फिर से
1:25:20
मैंने फ़िल्टर बनाया और मैं फ़िल्टर में यहां पर क्लिक करता हूं। प्लैंक हटा देता हूं और स्टडी हटा देता हूं। ठीक है? एंड
1:25:26
देन इसके बाद ओके करता हूं। यह एनए वाले कीवर्ड है जिनमें कोई भी इधर-उधर ज्यादा
1:25:31
सर्चेस नहीं है Google के हिसाब से। तो मैं इन सारे कीवर्ड्स को भी यहां से डिलीट मार देता हूं।
1:25:39
डिलीट रोज़ अब फ़्टर फिर से हटा देता हूं। ठीक है? अब मेरे पास वो सारे के सारे कीवर्ड्स हैं जिनमें डिमांड स्टेडी है।
1:25:46
ट्रेंड स्टेडी है। जो डिफिकल्टी है वो मीडियम टू लो है। जो सर्च वॉल्यूम है वो
1:25:51
50 से ऊपर है। यानी कि सर्च वॉल्यूम भी ठीक-ठाक है। अब अगर आपकी एजेंसी आप डिसाइड करते हो कि मुझे 50 नहीं मुझे 500 वाले
1:25:57
कीवर्ड के ऊपर ही मेहनत नहीं करनी है। तो अगेन डिसीजन आपका होगा। लेकिन इस प्रोसेस को फॉलो करके आपके पास ऐसे कीवर्ड्स आ
1:26:05
जाएंगे जिसमें कंपटीशन लो है जिसमें इंटेंट अच्छा है, कमर्शियल है, ट्रांजैक्शनल है। हमने सारे के सारे
1:26:10
नेविगेशन वाले हटा दिए। ठीक है? दिखाई दे रहे हैं अभी यहां पर। आई थिंक यहां पर दिखाई दे रहे हैं। दिखाई दे रहे हैं अगर
1:26:15
तो हम यहां पर फिर से एक फ़िल्टर बना लेते हैं। फ़िल्टर में सारे हटा दिए हमने। ब्लैंक्स हटा दिए, कमर्शियल हटा दिए,
1:26:21
ट्रांजैक्शन हटा दिए, नेविगेशनल बचे। नेविगेशनल दोनों डिलीट कर दो। ठीक है? जो भी नहीं चाहिए उसे डिलीट करते गए। एंड देन
1:26:29
हमारे पास ऐसे कीवर्ड्स की लिस्ट एक आ जाएगी जिसमें ट्रांजैक्शनल और कमर्शियल
1:26:34
वाले कीवर्ड हैं जिनमें हम पैसे कमा सकते हैं। जिनमें हमारा बिनेस जब भी अपीयर होगा
1:26:40
तो वो कीवर्ड ऑटोमेटिकली हमें बिज़नेस देगा ही देगा। ठीक है? सर्च वॉल्यूम बढ़िया है।
1:26:45
तो अब ये लिस्ट हमारे पास अच्छी सी आ गई। ठीक है? एक बार हमने इस लिस्ट को वेरीफाई कर लेते हैं। डेट रेंज सॉर्ट शीट रेट इन Z
1:26:53
टू A। ठीक है? यह सर्च वॉल्यूम के बेस पर ही ऑलरेडी लिस्टेड है। नाउ अब हमारे पास कीवर्ड्स की ये शीट रेडी हो गई है। ओके?
1:27:00
कीवर्ड रिसर्च आपने डन कर लिया। अब हमें काम क्या करना है? डेंटल क्लीनिक नियर मी। ये मेरा पहला कीवर्ड है जिसमें कीवर्ड
1:27:08
डिफिकल्टी मीडियम है। ओके? ओके। रैंक हो जाएगा। ट्रांजैक्शनल है। जो लेंथ है वो भी परफेक्ट है। जो स्ट्रेंड है वो भी एकदम
1:27:14
स्टडी और सर्च वॉल्यूम भी बहुत अच्छा है। तो हम पहला जो कंटेंट बनाएंगे वो क्या
1:27:19
होगा? डेंटल क्लीनिक नियर मी के लिए होगा। फिर डेंटिस्ट नियर मी। फिर टीथ क्लीनिक नियर मी। फिर डेंटल क्लीनिंग नियर मी
1:27:25
वगैरह-वगैरह करके हमारे पास कीवर्ड्स हम यूज़ कर सकते हैं अपने कंटेंट को जनरेट
1:27:30
करने में। नाउ एक क्वेश्चन नॉर्मली आता है स्टूडेंट्स की तरफ से कि इसमें से कितने कीवर्ड्स हम यूज़ करें? कितना कंटेंट पीस
1:27:38
बनाएं और ये डिसाइड करेगा क्लाइंट का बजट। लेट्स से क्लाइंट का बजट है 50,000। ओके?
1:27:44
और आपको पता है कि आपकी एजेंसी या आप पर्सनली जो भी आपके टाइम की वैल्यू है वो
1:27:50
इतने बजट में 500 के बजट में आप महीने में लेट्स से 50 कंटेंट ही लिख सकते हो। ठीक
1:27:56
है? 50 पीसेस कंटेंट लिख सकते हो। तो यहां टॉप में से आपने 50 कीवर्ड्स निकाल लिए ये 50 कीवर्ड्स आप यूज़ करोगे इस महीने। अगले
1:28:03
महीने जो इस लिस्ट में नीचे 50 से 100 तक होंगे उनको यूज़ करोगे। करेक्ट? अगर
1:28:08
क्लाइंट का बजट 500 नहीं है। 10,000 ही है। महीने के आप सिर्फ 10 पीसेस ऑफ़ कंटेंट लिख सकते हो। तो यहां टॉप में से आपने 10
1:28:13
उठा लिए। 10 के ऊपर काम करते हैं। ठीक है? अगर ये मैं काम करता रहता हूं। 6 महीने हो
1:28:19
जाते हैं। 6 महीने के बाद अगर क्लाइंट आपसे बोलता है कि भ या आपको लगता है कि जितने भी कीवर्ड थे मेरे कमर्शियल
1:28:26
ट्रांजैक्शनल वो हो चुके हैं। मैं एक बार इनफेशनल जो कीवर्ड हैं उनके ऊपर भी जा सकता हूं। अगर क्लाइंट बोलता है कि भाई
1:28:33
मेरी ब्रांडेड क्वेरीज भी ऐसा होता है कि कोई सर्च करता है स्माइल डेंटल क्लनिक नियर मी और मेरा बिजनेस नहीं दिखाई देता
1:28:39
है तो आप सिर्फ नेविगेशनल जो कीवर्ड्स हैं उनको टारगेट कर सकते हैं। तो एक बार कीवर्ड रिसर्च कर लिया आपने तो आप डिसाइड
1:28:46
कर सकते हो कि आपका जो एसइओ कैंपेन है वो कितने बजट में किस स्पीड पर आगे बढ़ेगा।
1:28:52
एक ही फंडा है। अगर एसइओ को बहुत जल्दी ग्रो करना है तो कंटेंट बहुत जल्दी स्केल अप करना पड़ता है। यहां पर इसका मतलब ये
1:28:59
नहीं है कि 1 महीने में 1 लाख पीसेस ऑफ डाल दिए तो वो स्केल्ड कंटेंट अब्यूज में चला जाएगा। स्पीड फिर भी धीरे-धीरे ही पुल
1:29:04
करनी पड़ेगी। बट अल्टीमेटली 3 महीने बाद भी अगर आप 1000 पीसेस ऑफ़ कंटेंट लिखना चाहते हो तो वो 1000 पीसेस ऑफ़ कंटेंट आज
1:29:11
से प्लान करने पड़ेंगे। अगर आपका कंटेंट आपकी ऑडियंस के लिए यूज़फुल है और आप
1:29:18
स्टेडी बना के रख सकते हो और आप अच्छा कंटेंट पब्लिश कर रहे हो तो आप महीने के 1 लाख कंटेंट भी डालोगे तो भी दिक्कत नहीं
1:29:24
होगी। एज लॉन्ग एज दे आर गुड एज लॉन्ग एज दे आर रिलेवेंट। Google को आपके कंटेंट वॉल्यूम से कोई प्रॉब्लम नहीं है।
1:29:29
प्रॉब्लम होती है जब वो सिर्फ सर्च के लिए लिखा जाता है कि हम 1 लाख पीसेस ऑफ़ कंटेंट लिखते हैं। देखें Google झक मार के हमारी
1:29:35
वेबसाइट को ट्रैफिक देगा। वहां पर प्रॉब्लम हो जाती है। सो ये है कीवर्ड रिसर्च की मैनुअल प्रोसेस जो वैसे तो
1:29:40
बोरिंग लगती है शुरुआत में देखने में लेकिन जब आप करने बैठते हो तो आपको एक्चुअली में इसमें मजा भी आने लगता है।
1:29:45
बिकॉज़ आप बिज़नेस को समझ रहे हो। आप बिज़नेस से जो रिलेटेड लोग क्वेरीज़ होती हैं उनको भी समझ रहे हो और उन क्वेरीज़ से अपने मतलब
1:29:53
कीवर्ड्स निकाल रहे हो ताकि उन कीवर्ड्स को आगे चलके हम लोग यूज़ कर सकें अपने कंटेंट को जनरेट करने में। सो ये थी वो
1:30:00
प्रोसेस जिसको यूज़ करके हम अपनी वेबसाइट के एसइओ कैंपेन के लिए कीवर्ड रिसर्च कर सकते हैं बिना किसी पेड टूल को यूज़ किए
1:30:05
हुए। तो इस पूरी प्रोसेस में हमने सिर्फ फ्री टूल्स को फ्रीली पब्लिकली अवेलेबल इनेशन को ही यूज़ किया है। और हमारे पास जो
1:30:11
डेटा आया है वो ज्यादा एक्यूरेट है किसी भी पेड टूल से। जैसे मैंने अभी एक्सप्लेन किया कि समरश या एचएफ या जो जितने भी टूल
1:30:18
है वो सब फर्स्ट पार्टी डेटा उनके पास नहीं होता है। Google के पास वो डेटा होता है और Google सेल नहीं करता है। ओके। सो
1:30:24
आगे आने वाली सेमरश की जो स्पेसिफिक क्लास होगी उसमें मैं सिखाऊंगा आपको कि कैसे हम सेमरश पर कीवर्ड रिसर्च को भी कर सकते
1:30:31
हैं। वो प्रोसेस थोड़ी सी फास्ट हो जाती है। इजी हो जाती है लेकिन अगेन जो वो डेटा है वो प्योर नहीं है। सो अभी फिलहाल जितने
1:30:38
भी स्टूडेंट्स हैं वो कीवर्ड रिसर्च मैनुअली करें। सीखें इस प्रोसेस को एंड देन कैलकुलेटर यूज़ करना है। यानी कि समरश
1:30:44
उस प्रोसेस को कुछ क्लिक्स के अंदर करना बहुत आसान है। कोई भी सीख जाएगा। ओके? अभी आप कीवर्ड सर्च करें और अगली क्लास में हम
1:30:51
लोग देखेंगे कि इस कीवर्ड्स की लिस्ट से कंटेंट के आइडियाज कैसे निकालें, टॉपिक्स
1:30:57
कैसे बनाएं? क्या लिखना है ये हम अगली क्लास में जानेंगे। फिर कैसे लिखना है ये
1:31:03
उससे अगली क्लास में जानेंगे। सो अभी कीवर्ड रिसर्च करें और कीवर्ड रिसर्च को सीखें अच्छे से प्रैक्टिस करें। ये थोड़ी
1:31:09
लंबी प्रोसेस है। इसमें अगर आप दो-तीन दिन लगाते हो तो अच्छा है। उस टाइम को लगाओ ताकि आप फाइंड आउट करो एक से एक अच्छे
1:31:16
बढ़िया कीवर्ड्स को। अगर आप कीवर्ड यूनिक फाइंड आउट करोगे तो आपको रिजल्ट भी यूनिक मिलेंगे। सो मिलते हैं अगली क्लास में
1:31:22
जिसमें हम बात करेंगे कंटेंट की प्लानिंग के बारे में। टॉपिक्स के आइडियाज निकालेंगे। किस तरह का कंटेंट हमें लिखना
1:31:29
है। ब्लॉग पोस्ट ना लिखें तो क्या लिखें? जो आप बार-बार क्वेश्चन पूछ रहे थे इसका आंसर आपको अगली क्लास में मिलेगा। तब तक
1:31:36
के लिए कीप अटेंडिंग द क्लासेस, कीप लर्निंग, कीप प्रैक्टिसिंग एंड आल्सो क्वेश्चन नोट करके रख लो ताकि आप पूछ सको
1:31:43
लाइव सेशन के अंदर। थैंक यू सो मच फॉर अटेंडिंग दिस क्लास। माई नेम इमति, फ्रॉम डॉट नेट एंड आई विल सी यू नेक्स्ट टाइम।

4:02
everyone how are we all doing uh and then for anyone that's joined one of my previous webinars uh and seen me before
4:09
hey nice to see you again um so as i say today we are going to be
4:15
looking at how to double your traffic through using google search console
4:21
so let me jump in um just let everyone know i'm not i haven't got a presentation um or
4:27
i have got a presentation i haven't got any slides to share with you guys today um it's all going to be on the fly we're
4:34
going to be jumping into um google search console maybe some other tools and look at how
4:41
this looks in search etc so today in this webinar we're going to be
What's covered in today's webinar
4:47
covering a brief explanation of what google search console is uh have you set
4:53
up your google search console uh a quick bit on validating google search console
4:58
what's in google search console and maybe if i say google search console once more i will win a prize
5:04
and then a quick word of warning how we can look at and flip the data in there
5:10
and then what can we do with this data so uh i will proceed so as i say um here's
5:17
a brief explanation on google search console for anyone going um i've heard about this not really sure or it might
5:24
be set up don't really know what is or what it's there for so google search
5:29
console is a free service offered by google that helps you monitor maintain and troubleshoot your site's presence in
5:36
google search results you can confirm that google can find and crawl your website and you can fix um indexing
5:43
problems and even request re-indexing of new or updated content and i hear a lot of people say this like
5:49
google search console is kind of like your personal portal uh to google where they can communicate issues with
5:56
your site so have you set up your google search console uh if you haven't i'm just going
6:03
to quickly share my screen as we neatly transition over
6:10
seamless perfect so um if you haven't uh set it
Setting up Google Search Console
6:16
up make sure you've got google account hope you have because you've set up google analytics but you'll most likely
6:22
come across this page to start off with so you either want to set up your google search console as a domain
6:29
or as url prefixes and i'll explain the difference between those so back in the
6:34
day you could only set up google search console through url prefixes and that
6:40
would be so say your website was example.com um and it was um
6:46
we're going very far back if it was an http www.example.com
6:51
you pop it in to the url prefix and you would set up your search console for
6:56
that but as time went on we and most people should have progressed onto https
7:02
version of your website so that would actually mean that you need to set up a second google search console
7:08
um property so you can view both sets of data and then in fact that even goes
7:13
even further because you've got actually i've got a nice little
7:18
let me pull this up
7:24
share the screen again i remember tristan back in the day when we were setting this up for a few customers of
7:31
ours we set it up four different times yeah we had one is for http the other is https and
7:37
the other is you have to do the www version and the non-www version of your domain so sorry
7:43
like four different properties google will kind of choose one you know in actual search results and that'll be the
7:49
primary but we weren't sure which one was going to be selected by google at the time yeah yeah yeah as uh once and
7:56
if you just share my screen so you can see that
8:02
this is just a quick example of the the different versions of a website that
8:07
russ was just talking about so ignore the the bottom four but these top four so example.com and then the https and
8:14
the www dots with the http and https so back in the day you would have had to
8:21
set up all four for you to have visibility of all of that now times have
8:26
changed and you can actually set it up for your entire domain which uh saves a lot of headaches
8:33
um russ what's your thoughts on setting it up for the whole domain but also setting
8:38
some url prefixes um if you wanted to interrogate certain sections of your website do you still feel that's
8:44
relevant now or is it a case of kind of just chuck it all in the domain
8:50
i think i think it can be handy right like being able to go and set up you know whether it's like you had the example shown there like
8:56
blog.example.com or even if it's example.com blog you can go and create a specific
9:02
profile for that you know part of your website and i don't think it's as
9:07
relevant anymore google has done a good job in recent you know years of really
9:13
exposing the filtering options in the data so you can kind of filter out and get the exact paths that you want to get
9:19
to and the right pages and so i think it's a little less relevant than it used to be in the past you actually couldn't
9:25
go and you know filter and organize the data as much as you wanted to so if you wanted to understand just your blog
9:31
traffic you'd go and set that up but i think today i wouldn't recommend it unless you really have a really solid you know use
9:37
case for it yeah yeah of course perfect uh yeah so go in and make sure
9:43
you set up one or the other but as we've kind of recommended go in and set up the domain version that should encompass
9:49
everything so you've gone to set that up uh and next you'll be taken to the validation stage uh there are i
Validating Google Search Console
9:56
can't remember whether you said there was six the other day that we spoke about russ or maybe i made that up i've
10:02
got five i think five is right right there's i mean you can go through and they're like meta tag there's putting a file on
10:10
your site there's verifying it with like uh the dns records um
10:15
what am i missing uh there's there's a few more there yeah so i've got you can
10:20
html file upload you can html meta tag added to the home page
10:27
you can use an existing google analytics account you can use gtm or you can use
10:32
the dns record which you said about russ um but just for everyone on validating and
10:39
why this is so important in many areas so search console gives you access to important data about your site as well
10:46
as tools that can do significant damage to your visibility if you use them
10:51
improperly so it's important to verify that you have the right authority and ownership to these views and properties
10:59
or sorry properties we've got mixed up with google analytics been doing too much of that today
11:04
and make decisions about content on the site otherwise you could
11:10
theoretically register profiles for competing websites wreak havoc on them and of course the same
11:17
could happen to you so it's kind of a very strict protocol so you can't screw over anyone else's site um
11:24
i will give the word warning now i've got it further down in my notes but a word of warning with google search
11:30
console is only ensure that anyone who needs access to your google search console has access
11:37
to your google google search console the reason for this is um i've heard
11:42
examples of this but you can access um like the disavow
11:48
file for your website through registering through this process and if
11:53
somebody maybe left your company was disgruntled and still had access they could
11:58
theoretically go through and say disavow every link on your website
12:04
which is not ideal and could tank your website along with a number of other things that someone could do
12:12
please yeah like another example is you can request you know pages to be de-indexed right
12:17
directly through search console and so try and do it for the home page and completely remove your site yeah yeah so
12:23
it's really important yeah it's yeah it's a very powerful tool and yes can
12:28
wreak havoc and make sure only people who need access have access um
12:34
yeah so let's have a little walk through google search console this is for anyone
Overview of Google Search Console
12:39
who hasn't used it before uh just to give you some ideas of what's in there
12:45
and i'll try and rattle through these quickly because i do love to talk and i already realized we're 12 to 15 minutes
12:50
into this so i have to pull myself back so this is google search console where
12:58
um this is the overview page which as it says gives you an overview
13:04
of your account performance coverage um and then sort of page experience here um
13:11
then we drill down into performance this is uh one of the areas we will be looking at in depth um it's quite fun uh
13:19
says me the nerd what you can get in here is you can get
13:25
um in these search boxes you can look for the data that's held in here
13:30
by web by image video or news today we'll only be looking at web
13:36
we've got dates so you can change your date range here which is fantastic now
13:42
because previously and i can't remember when this changed it used to only collect 90 days worth of
13:48
information and then that would be kind of lost and then you'd constantly be collecting only 90 days worth so
13:55
um if you were sort of a bit more in the know i guess people would download this
14:00
information and keep it on record but back in the day a lot of people didn't do that so you'd only ever have 90 days
14:06
worth whereas now you can see we can have up to the last 16 months worth of data stored in here
14:12
which is fantastic it's just it's such a wealth of information
14:17
some of the other filters and tabs in here sorry
14:22
uh you can click new and then you can actually start to search with this data by a search query
14:30
a page you can even break that down to country specific searches what device they're searching
14:37
on and even search appearance so we're not going to go that deep today but you can start to see
14:43
when you're looking to increase your traffic from the data you already hold on your pages and
14:50
search query and search traffic you can really start to break it down if you're a site that's international
14:57
you know you can start to see is there a particular country or market that we really want to be starting to step up and understand how we're being visible
15:04
et cetera in that country the same with devices you might start to be in a position to
15:10
look into going actually you know our desktop's in a good position but our mobile's lacking what are we going to
15:15
look at that or just to see if there's any disparities between those two there's also you can toggle these little
15:23
tabs here so at the moment you can see these two graphs we've got total clicks by total impressions which is very cool
15:29
and then you can even add average click-through rate and then average position and then this data all
15:36
populates underneath so it starts to become very very helpful and i'll just rattle through a few more of these
15:42
on the side we've got url inspection so i've already got one live for us just to
15:48
have a quick look at he says whilst it loads this is a great little page because i've
15:55
just looked at a specific url and this tells me that my url is on google
16:01
and i can actually view the crawled page i can see that it's been submitted and indexed i can go through and look a bit
16:08
of mobile usability and i can even see there's some um review snippets on this
16:13
page as well exactly and what's great you know sometimes you might hear people saying
16:19
oh what's the canonical for this page um and in here you can find this
16:25
information out there are other ways of finding this information out but this is a great spot to come in and have a look
16:32
and just one thing tristan on that url inspection page it's a powerful tool as well if you have some problem on a page
16:39
and you go and fix it you can actually go in there and just request google to re-index that specific page of your site
16:45
so if you fix problems you can just ask google to come in and say hey prioritize this page let's get it done quickly
16:50
exactly it's a great test super powerful super powerful um and then under the index section
16:57
we've got the coverage tab so you can see what errors valid warnings
17:02
what pages you've excluded we've got site maps here so we can jump in and see what specific site maps we've got um how
17:10
many urls have been discovered in there you know has it been successful or not
17:15
really great ways to you know do some monitoring on your site maps then we've
17:21
got the removals tab which is what we spoke about earlier about actually removing particular pages on your
17:28
website uh do be careful with that if you're in a position where you think oh
17:34
actually i don't want this page to be indexed anymore um because uh it might
17:41
be a an event page as an example and you go that events pass so i'm going to say to google i don't want this page to
17:47
exist anymore don't go in there and request it to be removed there should be other ways that
17:53
you are putting in redirects um in place but that's for another day uh and then
18:01
below that we've got um i missed one out
18:06
so we've got page experience here which populates uh your core webview tools your mobile usability is your site https
18:15
then the core web vitals jumps down even further in the next tab we've got mobile usability
18:21
i'm not going to jump into the enhancements this time round this one's quite good security and manual actions
18:28
here you can see whether there are google's picked up any security issues or you can see if you've received a
18:33
manual action uh and then a couple of last ones links so if you're ever wondering um what links are coming to
18:41
your site externally and then what you're linking to internally you can find this information out here you don't
18:47
actually need to go out and pay for at all to find out what links are coming to your site google will give you some of
18:53
this information then lastly settings as i said at the beginning be careful who has access to your site uh because you
19:00
might want to come into settings and just have a little review of that if you've been working with any um you know
19:05
any members of staff that are left old agencies whatever it is go in there just have a little double check to ensure
19:13
that everything's okay um so well let me have a little scroll down
19:20
lillian here has a has an interesting question for you i think might be interesting for us to jump on um she's asking how about a page that is shown as
19:27
valid in the url inspection tool but google refuses to index it even after
19:32
requesting time and time again to have them index it's an interest it's a tough question
19:37
to answer i'll let you know i'll take a stab then you're next
19:44
um i think the first thing i would look at is is just try and look at the the quality of the content on the page right
19:51
a lot of times google will not index a page because it's maybe it has a limited number of content or a little amount of
19:58
content or google for some reason is perceiving it as a low quality page and
20:03
so that was that would be the first thing that i would check if you like you have a page google's giving you a green
20:08
thumbs up but you can't find it in a search result try and try and optimize the content of the page and then the
20:14
next step i would do this is the second thing is try and make sure that google is seeing the content on the page so you
20:19
can actually dig into the url inspection tool and see the html see if you can find some of the text or some of the
20:26
copy on the page within the html and if google is picking that up those are two paths to kind of go down and check to
20:32
troubleshoot i don't know if you have any other ideas but it's a difficult one yeah yeah no i like those i like those
20:38
and uh hopefully was it lillian hopefully that will help you um in the
20:43
right direction there but yeah you know reach out if um you have further problems please
20:49
um so the next part of uh what i want to show you guys is so how to look and flip
20:56
the data or how to look at and flip the data so i'm just going to jump back into sharing my screen
21:03
i need some sort of transition music to play over the top
21:09
um and so as i say i'm just going to populate all of these this is probably going to be the page
21:16
the um part of this webinar you you will take away and look at afterwards uh so
What can we do with Google Search Console Data
21:21
let's take um a couple of scenarios here so your website has been live for x
21:26
amount of time and you're thinking of optimizing your site's content so where can you start with that
21:33
and where can you look for opportunities to create new content and why i say it like that is a lot of
21:39
people i still see today is you know we're told google likes fresh
21:44
content it likes updated content um and it likes relevant content so some people
21:50
just go off and they you know quite rightly will build a content plan seo
21:55
plan whatever you want to call it and go right so what are the pieces of content i'm creating and what's that looking
22:01
like over the next six or 12 months so you kind of become a content churning machine just pumping out new fresh
22:07
awesome pieces of content but you might also be sitting there going i don't know what new content to create and
22:14
is my content on my site working as hard as it could be well this is where google
22:20
search console comes in and is your friend so let's jump into the performance tab as we are here um what i
Website one live example - caribbeanpaddling.com
22:27
like to do is uh change the date range so change it for whatever your makes you feel comfortable um and works
22:34
with your sort of business model um yeah we've had a very turbulent well it's like 18 months almost two years pushing
22:42
into next year of uh covid et cetera um so you know
22:47
your data will not necessarily be as normal as it has been in previous years
22:53
and seasons depending on what your website's about um so just you know keep that in mind whenever selecting any date
22:59
ranges but i'm just for this i'm just going to select the last six months i feel that's a good pool of data for me
23:05
to have a look at uh and then we can have a look at the search queries now one way you can instantly jump in is
23:13
uh just to start flipping the data um by clicks and impressions so what i mean by
23:19
that is here you can see with this site uh this particular
23:25
query has had around 10 000 impressions and just under 800 clicks so that's
23:30
about a 7.2 click-through rate so it's seemingly quite reasonable but you might
23:36
want to try and close that gap so one initial way that works quite well is
23:41
that you can actually take some of these keywords and start to see what pages they're related to and
23:47
whether you can improve your title tags and meta descriptions
23:53
just to improve the click-through rate from your from google's landing page to your
23:59
website and so what you can do straight away is we can jump into pages and we can
24:06
actually look at the same information we were with queries but with pages so if
24:11
we have a look at impressions again so impressions are the amount of times it's been served to people when searching but
24:19
no one clicked on that so that's where the clicks comes in and so what we can start to see
24:25
is say this particular page here you know it's had almost 30 000
24:31
impressions but only 51 clicks um and not only and i will continue with the
24:39
content optimization but this one's quite interesting because you might actually start to find some technical
24:44
issues with your site uh because whilst i was looking through these previously before we went live i thought well i can
24:51
have a look at this page and see what this page is about now you might not see this happening but
24:57
when i loaded that page up there's actually a redirect from the original page to what's now a gallery page so i
25:04
have a little scroll down and beautiful images but there's not a lot of content
25:11
on there so i just took this one step further and have i got it here and i well i
25:18
won't show you now but i put it into a tool called wayback machine so that's a
25:23
little snapshot and record of your website over time that's stored on the
25:28
wayback machine it's very useful to look at old content um of websites um
25:34
of days weeks months years gone by and so what i found was that
25:40
the original page here actually had quite a lot of content on
25:46
st martin or sint martine and what's happened is this has actually
25:51
been redirected to what looks like a gallery page through a bit of searching it looks like
25:57
this might be the um redirect that should have been put in place to this page where we actually
26:04
talk about um saint martin or synth martin
26:09
so just i think it's oswin who uh kindly allowed us access to his google search
26:14
console um what i would do for you is i would look at that redirect in place and
26:20
maybe change that from the url that we clicked on to land on this page and not
26:27
uh this page because this one is seemingly the updated version of the lost page
26:35
and so google can put a to b and go oh okay and hopefully we'll start ranking you better
26:42
um for these terms in this page uh once you've linked everything back up
26:47
um do we have any questions coming through whilst uh i'm just chatting away
26:53
i don't think we've got any at the moment so i i think i'll jump in though i think i
27:00
think i think this is super interesting right because you you quickly identified there a technical problem with your
27:05
website the page people clicking on search results are being redirected somewhere else probably google is being
27:12
redirected and seeing this lower quality content that's not there so you're giving yourself a direct item to fix
27:18
immediately on this site um and and improve that on an ongoing basis
27:24
yeah so i mean that's because it's not like a content a straight-up content optimization
27:30
technique but you have found an issue which hopefully once you've sorted out
27:35
you should see uh better quality traffic coming through to the the correct page that you want
27:42
google to see on this page and so then you should see some positive
27:47
benefits from that and let me just see what we've got coming up next
27:52
[Music] so let me just jump back into here
28:02
so as an example if you have a phrase um if we were looking at sanctuaries
28:08
oh actually what i will do is another cool thing you can do is we can copy
28:13
this url or we'll copy this url and then we can
28:19
put new and then click page and put in the url that we've just copied
28:26
and on this time we're just going to look at the exact url so we don't want to look at anything that might be in a
28:31
subfolder from from this page so we'll just click apply
28:36
and so obviously we can see we've got our one page there but what the beauty here is
28:42
is we've got all the search queries that google's picked up for this page uh so as an example
28:51
um if a phrase is in position 21 or higher um
28:56
and has if it's in position 21 um or has a high number of impressions but a low
29:02
click-through rate uh you can have a look at taking these keywords uh and looking to increase the keyword
29:09
density in your existing content so just remember don't just stuff keywords into
29:14
your content as many times as possible look for opportunities to include it organically
29:20
and i'll cover some of this a little bit further down but what you might find through some of the search queries
29:25
coming up is that not only you want to optimize your title tag and meta description to increase click-throughs
29:32
but you might also want to take some of these keywords look at the page you're working on and go
29:39
do some of these fit in with this particular page it's saying it's being associated to uh is there
29:45
anything in there that actually you might find i we seem to be coming up for this
29:51
search query but we haven't really delved into it that much on this page have we delved into it in other parts of
29:57
our website so this is where content can then start to grow so it's like actually we might be looking at putting paragraph
30:02
sections into this already created piece of content uh just to bolster it out
30:08
even more to make it more relevant for the user and google um in turn
30:15
increasing relevancy hitting more search terms sort of you know the basic look at it you should be able to increase your
30:22
position and and how easy it is for people to find you um as well as uh yeah so we've added
30:30
content to our page but you might also find going ah this doesn't really sit on this page but this is great this is a
30:37
great new piece of content i can write and actually this original piece of content where it didn't sit it's a great
30:43
link through to this piece of content and this new piece of content might seemingly link back to the previous
30:51
article just because of the connections that are involved with the content um so i seemingly have already jumped
30:58
into the next section of what can we do with this data um but just uh for a little bit of information
31:04
for everyone um firstly it should be noted that google analytics held keyword data back in the day many many moons ago
31:11
uh this was removed by google due to privacy uh yet thankfully you can get a lot of this
31:17
information in google search console so it's really prime if you haven't set this up make sure you you know you get
31:24
that done this week next week because you just want even if you're not going to use it straight away for three six months you just want that data being
31:30
collected collect collect collect because then you'll be in a position at some point to
31:35
update your content and seo plans uh you know and then this will allow you through this tool as well to review the
31:42
seo impact of your updates and you know don't forget to review your changes you've made to see what improvements
31:49
there were or weren't hopefully there were and you know have metrics changed um you
31:55
know has the average position changed did your total impressions or average
32:01
click-through rate increase this is what we want to see so it's definitely worth um
32:07
you know doing this but also looking at what results you got from this uh you know
32:13
and you can start by doing this by listing all your top performing pages actually i'm just gonna so you can all
32:19
see my face a little bit more um we can start this by listing our top performing pages and see how we can
32:26
increase the click-through rate from serps what pages are indexed with related
32:31
search queries that we can use to bolster pages traffic rankings and relevancy uh what search queries are
32:38
coming up that may require a new page or additional content on specific page uh
32:43
and as i said right at the beginning you can also break this down to looking at you know particular countries
32:50
and devices adding this all into the mix you can hopefully already start to see that just from what we've looked at
32:56
before jumping into any site examples we can start with our own data to find
33:02
issues and find opportunities to move forward so you can really start to build out your own kind of content plan seo
33:08
plan for the next few months with the data you already hold without really
33:14
you know kind of going off and going right what new content can we create i'm going to start keyword researching all that
33:21
malarkey competitor research start in here you've got so much in here definitely start and utilize that as
33:28
much as possible and so tristan one of my favorite things i'll share to you here is
33:34
you can actually exclude terms in the google search console so
33:40
excluding the brand of the business or of the website itself and removing those you start to see just
33:47
the places where you're showing up for organic terminology and those are things
33:53
that you can either say cool i want to turn that into you know a keyword i'm going to build some content focusing on
33:59
those things that i'm already getting some traction for and and leverage that type of information or even just say oh this is
34:06
maybe not as interesting and i can see why i am showing up there i'm not going to prioritize that and work on that type
34:12
of content too which is just as important yeah and the second example site i've
34:17
got there are some of those things that you were just saying there where they seem to be coming up for
34:23
certain search queries pages have come gone but it doesn't appear to be
34:28
necessarily about the business in itself so you know it's it's looking at well okay maybe we
34:35
need to increase the relevancy of what we're shouting about the service the business uh in terms of
34:41
yeah pushing that out forward uh so let me just get my next screen
34:53
seamlessly moving through this if i say it enough then we all just sort of believe it's seamless don't we
34:59
uh anton if you could post up my page for us that would be brilliant
35:05
lovely so the first site you've already seen um some of this it's caribbean paddling
35:11
very jealous it's uh run by oswin who was kind enough to allow us access to the google search console for this site
35:19
um i really want to go to the caribbean and do some paddle boarding and kayaking so um yeah
35:26
so let me jump into here so we're going to have a look at what um a
35:33
couple of examples of what we can do with this site
35:38
so as i say you can sort by clicks and impressions and so my first example is going to be
35:46
that one so we're gonna have a look at pages and
35:52
let me just scroll down and make this a little larger
36:01
and i'm just going to copy this particular page so this particular page
36:06
has got just short 9000 impressions and just short of 90 clicks over the last
36:11
six months with about one percent um click-through rate so what we're going to do is we're just going to pop
36:18
in the page up here as i say try to make it exact if you just want to
36:25
look at this specific page which we will do here
36:32
and for this specific page we're going to have a look at the queries for the page
36:37
now i've already gone through had a look at the page i will just populate it here for everyone to have a look
36:46
so it's the top five essential paddle boarding tips for beginners so anyone who's been around seo for a while knows
36:53
that a top five anything is sort of seemingly quite popular content and
36:58
quite popular uh to be searched for um so you know this is great you're
37:03
you're offering paddling or paddle boarding and kayaking services so why wouldn't you have the top five essential
37:10
tips so some great tips stay hydrated stretch wear a life vest
37:16
great so how can we do more with this so i've already gone through this data had to
37:22
look through here and i'm just going to pick out some of the key phrases that i found so
37:28
what do i need for paddle boarding so sorry i'm going faster than i need to be
37:35
similar to how we've been flipping the data before we've been looking at clicks and impressions so if we have a look at
37:41
the impressions here versus clicks oh some of these searches don't appear to be getting any clicks and so what we can
37:48
see here is there's a couple of uh cool searches uh question-based searches so
37:53
what do i need for paddle boarding and how to hold a
37:59
paddle board paddle um and so these might be particular things that you can
38:05
easily add in to your top five i don't know how essential
38:10
some of those question based things are but what i'm showing you is you can see that a question's being asked google's
38:17
saying this is related to your site you're coming up around these search terms but no one's clicking so
38:25
a great one would be to come through here see what you feel
38:30
could be added to your page uh in terms of making it more relevant so i've noted
38:36
down the the two i said which was what do i need for paddleboarding how to hold a paddle board paddle
38:43
and there was another one do you need to know how to swim to paddleboard which actually sounds like quite a serious um
38:50
question and you know i'd say yes you do need to swim but from understanding where this um paddleboarding takes place
38:58
i believe it might be quite shallow so you know it might be that you can say well if you you know you're not such a
39:03
great swimmer um you've got a life jacket um you know there's lifeguards in the area blah blah that's a great
39:10
question to answer or to go in on because it's clearly a need a concern
39:17
and it you know it wouldn't take a lot to add in just those three question based
39:23
questions into your article and that will hopefully bolster things out more um and then with this because
39:31
obviously i wanted to try and um increase your click-through rate from uh search um
39:38
hopefully i can get this to come up
39:46
i'm just going to share a different screen
39:52
window there we go so i'm just going to share this other screen so
39:58
the title tag um for this page let's just move that up so i don't see a bit better was the top five essential
40:06
paddle boarding tips for beginners uh and then the meta description was so you've taken up the sport of paddle
40:11
boarding and you're wondering how to optimize your experience on the water with essential gear now with time not
40:18
being on my side i didn't change too much of the title tag but what i did do was i just put in the
40:24
brand name at the end so we can at least a we've got the phrase caribbean in the
40:30
title tag but we've also got the brand name and the tag you might want to spend a little bit longer to see in the search
40:37
queries that are coming up whether you find that there's something a little bit more prominent um to add to this page uh
40:44
actually sorry i did change this i put top five beginners paddle boarding tips because this seemed like it was more for
40:50
the beginners um so i felt that might be a bit more relevant than essential but again that might be something you want
40:56
to test and then in the meta description i've changed it to check our list of
41:01
paddle boarding tips for beginners avoid first time mistakes explore caribbean waters in your sup with advice from the
41:09
experts so to me that's kind of like come to us we're the experts you know we'll give you all the advice you kind
41:15
of get an idea of what you're really clicking through on and hopefully it gives it a bit more relevancy
41:21
and then hopefully a few words changes that the idea is that we've increased the relevancy um you know to the person
41:28
looking and that they want to click through even more than they did before and it stands out more to them
41:34
um and another great one i'm just going to change my screen sharing
41:44
[Music] let's actually share this screen
41:51
uh and so where is the there we go so i just took the uh title
41:58
for the page uh top five essential paddle boarding tips for beginners and popped it into google and what you
42:04
can see straight away so this might give you some further ideas um is that you might want to start writing your content
42:12
say like in some list forms or marking it up uh correctly um so that you can
42:19
try and take this featured snippet on this page although i'm not sure yeah so
42:25
green waters yeah greenwatersports.com isn't ranking in position one but
42:31
because they've gained the featured snippet they're in that position zero so you know along with adding more
42:38
question-based uh information on your page by changing your title and
42:43
description and then by having a little search on google search you can start to see what
42:49
other people are doing and start to craft a little plan for yourself in a staged approach you can
42:55
see it's like right i know what i want to optimize my content for this is i'm going to do it i'm going to put some
43:02
tracking in place to see how this is improved and what's what's other people doing and you can
43:07
see there's a list here top 10 tips list so you know are you gonna then go back
43:13
to yours and mark up your page differently um from your top five uh
43:18
tips or just from a bit of research you might go actually top 10 tips is actually
43:24
it's top 10 tips oh i disappeared there for a second am i back russ yes you're doing it you're you're well
43:30
you pause for a sec but you're good uh perfect uh so yeah i'm just going to stop showing my screen for a second
43:36
there um and so that kind of neatly because i realized time is uh dramatically getting away from us um
43:43
some of the other suggestions for that site i've got is i was looking at a
43:48
things to do page on pineal island i think it was which um
43:53
was a very popular search term i believe that pineal island is around um where
43:59
this company is and so obviously there's going to be a lot of searches around that um and i saw
44:04
that that page was coming up for snorkeling in uh pineal um and then snorkeling pineal island
44:12
saint martin where you actually have a page um on the
44:17
best snorkeling spots in pineal island as a separate on the website so through my searching you wouldn't necessarily go
44:23
well i'm going to add a whole section of snorkeling information on this page you might just want to add a tiny bit and
44:28
say hey go over and check out our best snorkeling spots in pineal island
44:34
so then that's not only a little bit time saving uh it helps the user out because they're like they
44:40
didn't know that existed they might have just come to that page read a bit of information and gone but by you adding the link in there
44:47
saying hey there's even more keep clicking through you can start to build up this web of internal linking keeping
44:54
people on your site because you just have more and more useful information that you want to give them and then
45:00
i won't go into it all now but google does look upon that quite fondly because it sees the relevancy the structure of
45:07
your site and can really start to understand what you're trying to tell people and you know what they can
45:14
get from you so that's that site let's just jump into
45:19
the next one
45:31
need some transitional lift music to happen yes
45:37
well just sharing my screen everyone and so the next site that we're looking at
45:42
is um this create my site so it's a web design digital marketing site so let's have a
Website two live example - cre8mysite.com
45:50
look in here so this was funny um
45:56
earlier in this webinar russ you were saying about sometimes finding um information isn't
46:01
necessarily relevant to your business but you're coming up for um and what i found was this site actually does
46:08
some of that so there's you know you're coming up searches for uh just change that six months a little
46:14
more data here we're looking at and obviously i don't fully know what was on the site
46:20
previously to what's on the site now but um i had a search online it's you're coming
46:27
up for privacy policy restaurant uh custom screen rooms i'm not gonna try
46:33
and pronounce that um custom patios so i don't know if you've
46:39
worked with particular clients that did these particular
46:45
types of sites or something like that or something else has happened and you're coming up for particular
46:51
search terms some of these you i guess you probably don't want to be and you want to be
46:56
bolstering because the company is in louisiana does web design so you want to kind of be bolstering these
47:03
uh search terms around your business uh when i jumped into the pages this and
47:08
this goes back to sort of finding some more i guess technical seo issues with your site um so this here we have
47:16
restaurant privacy policy so of course i have a click through let's have a look at what's going on
47:22
this page has been moved okay so we've hit a 404 page there uh should that be redirected um
47:30
i'm having a little scroll through further and then i think it was maybe this one
47:36
premium web design again this page is hitting a 404 um and i won't go through
47:41
too many more um but there was quite a few pages that were hitting 404s i think
47:46
it was 22 out of 50 pages actually i found because i've shoved them through
47:52
screaming frog um just to see what the status code it was came back with and so
47:57
yeah 22 of those pages out of 50 were hitting a 404 page if you've got access to your google
48:03
analytics and everything for this you might find some of these pages were actually
48:08
uh quite traffic driving over there over you know previous time that you
48:13
might be like actually i need to redirect these pages to the appropriate place rather than just letting them 404
48:20
or it might be that you want them to 404 for a particular reason um
48:26
yeah i think there's even a page which is on page seo which hits a 404 page but delving
48:33
through the site i actually found you had a specific seo page and so without me
48:38
having a look at what was on the original on page seo page i
48:43
if all going well i would probably take that page that's 404 ring and redirect it to your new seo page because if
48:51
you're just taking pages down there 404 and you're creating a new page over here with similar ish content it's starting
48:58
to confuse everything you're starting to gain a lot of yeah 404 pages that you don't want so just
49:04
within this not only like optimizing your content as we said you can start to find some issues uh with the site so my
49:14
my recommendations here would be to come back into the site in search console um
49:21
because i see that it's a company that's um in louisiana but from what i could see there wasn't a
49:27
huge amount of references to louisiana like website louisiana louisiana web
49:34
design on the website and i also because i had to do a bit hunting i found it difficult to find the
49:42
name address uh i could find the phone number but that's seen as in local um
49:48
seo as your map nap name address and phone number and so it's
49:55
advantageous to have that in your footer throughout your site because then that gets read picked up
50:01
and that will help you with localized seo in your local area
50:08
something else i noticed was and this might be a great place to start
50:15
by mining some of this data um there was a blog
50:20
for latest news which seemed to have no content on there so that's a great place
50:26
just to start adding um some information that you're finding that you
50:31
feel it won't fit on a service page but you want to kind of talk about you know it might be top 10 tips of seo or
50:38
something like that you're starting to see come up in your search queries so if it's not can't be added to a service
50:43
page in this example it might be um recommended that you can start adding that to your blog
50:49
um i in this website's instance i probably have a look at running a technical audit
50:55
but that's not what we're here to talk about today find out what pages are live which ones aren't uh and then figure out
51:01
your redirects um and get everything redirected to their new homes and then look at your pages products and
51:08
services you want to promote and work on optimizing content from there so what core pages
51:13
can be bolstered what secondary pages can be created and linked to
51:18
and then our final site is this awesome site dog alliance and i
Website three live example - thedogalliance.org
51:24
think it was debbie from dog alliance who was kind enough to allow us access to the google search console for this
51:31
one um let me just jump into performance for this
51:38
um and so i took a slightly different approach because hopefully i've given everybody
51:44
three examples of kind of how to use this information and data and not
51:49
only look to try and take this information and work hard at your
51:55
content to try and you know seemingly double your traffic but also how to find other issues in there
52:03
and this is kind of the final one of um some other tools that we can use to
52:09
get ahead as well so let me jump into pages
52:15
and extend that a little
52:21
and it's a it's a lovely page on puppies
52:27
learn more about puppies so it's this lovely page here uh learn more
52:33
about puppies uh puppy training tips that's fantastic so we're just gonna take this page
52:41
add it in that url
52:47
the magic happens and then we'll look at the search queries
52:52
so in here we've got puppy training tips puppy training there's a huge amount let's just flip those clicks
53:01
that seems strange there are no clicks we won't get bogged down with that at
53:06
the moment that might be something that we need to maybe converse with debbie afterwards to have a look at but what i did was i took
53:13
the top top 30 impression giving
53:18
search queries then what i did was you can use i think there's a number of tools you can use
53:23
but semrush has got a seo content template and what you do is you jump
53:29
into the seo recommendations i dumped 30 of the top
53:34
um impression giving search queries this comes back it gives you loads of
53:41
information here um of different keywords etc but this is the crux of
53:46
what we want to look at so i dumped the content from the page in here and as you can see it's slightly working away here
53:54
to give us our seo score um but in short what we found
54:00
was um let me pull some of the [Music]
54:09
so i think in here it's got about puppy videos and is there actually anything on puppy
54:16
videos
54:26
so there's um oh one thing that actually on this page is that a number of these links when i
54:34
went through actually are all external links so what you might find from looking at your um search query data is
54:41
because ideally you want to keep people on your site spending as much time with you as possible and so what you might
54:46
find is that from some of the search query data you don't actually need to start sending these people to external
54:52
sites you can start adding this content yourself and keeping people on the site itself
54:58
through some of the search queries that i found you definitely don't cover or cover in
55:05
depths around some of these search queries so a great way as i say to do this is dump
55:13
the content in here you've got your target keywords and you can start to go through
55:19
and so i know this website talks a bit about service dog training and so have a look through this content and see where
55:26
you're talking about service dog training in austin and where you might be able to extend on
55:32
that in this piece of content or you might be able to send someone to the service dog training page where they can
55:38
then find out more um yeah help with puppy training
55:43
socialization training with dogs or puppy training basics uh for the
55:48
first week very little of this was kind of covered in depth um and so hopefully that you
55:54
know will help you give you the mindset where it's like oh this is how i can look at this content slightly differently
56:01
and start building out um your your current content and your
56:06
future content and so that will give you the opportunity to sort of quite easily now after this hopefully
56:13
start building an seo plan and strategy moving forward just based on the data you've got
56:19
and the search query information you've got um so that brings me to the end of what
56:26
i came to show everyone there was a little bit more but i do apologize to everyone watching i do like to talk um so
56:33
if anyone has any questions after this do feel free to get in contact with me
56:38
um i'd be happy to talk through a few of the other um things that i found um yeah
56:44
russ did you did you have anything you wanted to jump in on that you felt i might have missed or
56:50
no i thought this was great i i really i really thought it was awesome how you found keywords that can be targeted and
56:56
focused for specific pages right you had some examples of pages that were not showing up well and you're saying cool
57:02
here's 5 or 10 or 15 that really you can see there's a lot of impressions you can
57:07
see there's a good amount coming and you can really go and optimize that content i think those are are really just solid
57:13
ways to to leverage the data that search console gives you and this is totally free something that anyone running a
57:20
site should should be doing and looking at at least on a you know monthly basis and trying to think about and say cool
57:26
how can i improve my presence or answer that question that somebody's asking on
57:31
search in a better way or try and bring in a bit more of these like targeted you know areas for us so i think it was
57:38
really really actionable uh information here so thank you um and then if anyone's
57:45
interested like this was kind of i guess like a glossary of you know just opening the door of what you can do um with
57:51
google search console so you know feedback would be awesome from the audience if you were like this just
57:58
didn't go deep enough i'd be happy to you know do do another episode in the
58:03
future where we can specifically drill down into an area you know the idea was i really wanted to just kind of give
58:09
anyone who's kind of like i do use search console or i don't or you know you're not using it enough uh that you
58:17
can kind of leave this and go ah this has given me a great idea it looks like we've got a question here from ann uh
Questions
58:24
did you mention an app that allows you to see if links in your site no longer go to anything so that i can remove them
58:31
or find the new links i have a small business directory website so i think that was screaming frog that i mentioned
58:38
so um screaming frog i can't remember how much is he about 120 150 quid pounds
58:45
sorry a year um but you can get i was just gonna say they have a great free version yeah that's about to say
58:51
yeah yeah but you can get a free version uh which you can crawl up to 500 urls so
58:58
um yes if you wanted any more information on that and do drop me a message on social media or anything like
59:04
that but it is fairly straightforward the process i went through was uh with create my site i just took a list of the
59:11
urls uh on the pages um section of google search console i exported those
59:18
so i just had 50 urls i uploaded that to
59:23
a screaming frog i got screaming frog to crawl those pages and basically it came
59:28
back and went you know like url one ah that's a 404 url too oh that's a 200
59:34
it's working okay and then it gives you back all that information so and that would probably be your best step forward
59:40
to see uh what's happening with your pages etc and then you can be
59:45
sat better going um these are all hitting 404 pages
59:51
what do i want to happen with that do i want to redirect them i want to leave them you can you can start to make a
59:58
little bit of a plan there because there isn't always one answer to these things so
1:00:04
be careful um let's have a look to see if we've got any other questions coming through
1:00:10
as we wrap up towards the end of what's seemingly been a very very fast hour
1:00:17
um ah and also another question i'm a beginner at this do you have a pdf or
1:00:24
anything you can recommend me to make sure i have included basic stuff that will help with seo uh that's certainly
1:00:31
something um yeah i'd be happy to sort of craft together and um we can possibly pop that out on another
1:00:38
webinar but uh yeah and get in contact with me i'm sure i've got something that i can i can help you with or i can
1:00:44
certainly send you um some links and resources that will help you in good stead and on your way
1:00:50
so oh this got questions flying in now christopher asks do you have any tips or
1:00:56
special consideration to apply to multilingual websites
1:01:04
big question that's a big question um so i don't know whether you've got anything to jump in for us i'll start
1:01:10
i'll start yeah i think i think i think the first thing i would say is street multi
1:01:16
language like almost like two different websites you know the search
1:01:21
volume and search queries that you're going to get in specific languages are going to be drastically different you
1:01:26
know if you have a french version and an english version the queries that are going to come in are going to be
1:01:32
different and what people search for are going to be different just based on the language itself and so you probably need to think about an seo
1:01:38
strategy and a keyword strategy specific for each language
1:01:44
that you're setting up and so if you're going into search console you should be maybe finding a way to filter a search
1:01:49
console just for you know that specific language page and then thinking about how you can optimize that content in
1:01:55
that language uh and and move that forward um so i think i think that would be probably step one of you know trying
1:02:03
to to think about multi-language is just really think about it and look at the data on a per
1:02:09
language basis try and avoid you know grouping things together because i think you're gonna just run into too many
1:02:14
problems in my opinion yeah that's great advice yeah and i hope you found that useful um
1:02:21
so yeah we uh we we have more questions um michael is asking my webshop has a
1:02:28
has a duplicate site because of parameters from changing the product layout on category pages
1:02:34
google is indexing them all what would you do if parameter exclusion in console isn't working would you like
1:02:41
that one too russ i've spoken the entire hour i totally haven't seen
1:02:49
i think i think my first piece of advice would be try and implement a canonical tag on the page so when you're you know no matter
1:02:56
what the variant is or the alternate version url parameter try and implement
1:03:02
a static or single canonical for that entire page to tell google that okay
1:03:08
there might be three or four you know urls for this page but here's the real source of truth in a canonical context
1:03:15
so i think that would be step one uh of trying i think
1:03:20
um also you might want to try
1:03:25
try in a different way and try to ask google to to ignore those url parameters
1:03:31
because you can go in it's one of the older tools that google provides is ignoring those url parameters you can
1:03:36
try and add that in and double check that uh as well although google is trying to get away from that so
1:03:43
they're trying to actually deprecate that tool so and i will actually because i've just
1:03:48
got it here antoine if you could share my screen when i do it in a sec and i will just
1:03:53
show everyone where that url parameters is whilst we're here and it's under the
1:03:59
legacy tools um and it's just the third one down url parameters down there so if
1:04:06
you're at all interested that's where russ was mentioning it was
1:04:11
so uh we we've yeah we've run over the hour uh apologies if anyone's um waiting
1:04:18
to get away to do something else this evening i just want to thank everyone for joining the webinar today i've had a
1:04:24
blast hopefully you have i see some regular faces in the comments so hey to

2:59
हो सकता है यह कि जो है वह रोल हो गया लेकिन इंडेक्स नहीं हो पाया तो ऐसी बहुत सारी चीज है अगर हम इस यूजर जानना चाहे
3:06
रिपोर्ट्स लेना चाहता हूं कहा जाए हमारे पास कोई ऑप्शन है इसलिए गूगल ने जो हमें डाल दिया हुआ है उसका नाम है Google सर्च
3:14
कंसोल गूगल बोलता है देखो वही सबसे पहला काम तो आप यह करो कि अगर आपके पास कोई वेबसाइट है तो सबसे पहले इसको Google सर्च
3:20
कंट्रोल में आप सबमिट कर दो जैसे ही आप Google सर्च कंसोल के अंदर अपनी वेबसाइट को सबमिट करोगे इसका मतलब यह है कि आप
3:26
Google के बॉस के साथ यह प्रॉब्लम के साथ ट्रैक्टर्स में आ गए क्योंकि Google सर्च ओं गूगल कई प्रोडक्ट है अभी गूगल का
3:33
प्रोडक्ट है इसके अंदर आपने अपनी वेबसाइट सबमिट कर दी वेबसाइट सबमिट करने का सीधा संबंध अपने URL सबमिट कर दिए अब आपका की
3:39
कोई URL है ऐसी स्लेब यह आपका कोई URL है अब गूगल सर्च कंसोल के अंदर यह समय है तो
3:45
आप अगर प्रॉबलम वहां से आएगा और आपके URL को कॉल करने का यह आखिरी आपके पेज को कॉल
3:50
करेगा कॉल करने के बाद जो भी उसको इन्फॉर्मेशन मिलेगी उसकी वह रिपोर्ट बनाकर कि देखो भाई तुम्हारे पेट में गैस
3:56
प्रॉब्लम है यह चीज है गड़बड़ चीज है इसको ठीक करना पड़े तो वह जो रिपोर्ट्स है वह
4:02
रिपोर्ट आपको दिखाएगा तो कैसे दिखाएगा रिपोर्ट्स आपको दिखाएगा थ्रू गूगल सर्च कर तो अभी आपको बात समझ में आ गई कि Google
4:09
सर्च कंसोल है कि कर क्या रहा है यह एक्चुली रोलर्स के और हमारी वेबसाइट के
4:14
बीच में एक ब्रिज की तरीके से बात कर रहा है यह हमें यह बताने की कोशिश कर रहा है
4:20
वर्क टू रूल की प्रॉब्लम हमारी वेबसाइट के साथ किस तरीके से इंटरेस्ट करें क्या उनको
4:25
प्रॉब्लम हो रही है हमारी वेबसाइट में क्या प्रॉब्लम है यह गूगल क्या रिकमेंडेशन दे रहा है यह सारी चीजें जो बताने का काम
4:31
है यह करता है हमारा गूगल सरकार तो इसका मतलब यह हुआ कि अगर हम अपनी वेबसाइट को गूगल सर्च कंसोल क्यू पर सबमिट कर देंगे
4:38
तो Google सर्च कंसोल के अंदर भी बहुत सारी छोटे-बड़े टूल्स है जो डिफरेंट डिफरेंट चीजों को मोनिटर करते हैं और उसके
4:44
विषय में रिपोर्ट बना कर देते तो इसका मतलब गूगल सर्च कंसोल दो चीजों से मिलकर बना हुआ था द रिपोर्ट्स एंड उसके अंदर भी
4:50
छोड़े और टैटू से वह तो अब यह स्टोंस और रिपोर्ट्स किस तरीके की हम इन्फॉर्मेशन देते हैं यह हम लोग समझ लेते हैं फाइल तो
4:57
गाइस यहां पर अगर मैं देखूं और कि आपको कोशिश करूं कि आखिर गूगल सर्च का
5:02
होगा क्या काम है अगर एक लाइन हम उसको समझने कोशिश करें तो यहां पर आप देखो सबसे पहला स्टेप लिखा हुआ एक मोनिटर्स मेंटेन
5:10
सेंट्रल सूट्स योर साइट प्रेजेंस इन गूगल सर्च इंजन जो मराठी वेडिंग और हम चाहते हैं कुछ स्पेसिफिक और इसके ऊपर हमारी
5:16
वेबसाइट गूगल के सर्च इंजन रिजल्ट इसमें दिखाई दे तो दिखाई देने के लिए कुछ प्रोसेस करनी पड़ेगी तो उन प्रोसेस में जो
5:24
हमने फोल्ड करते हैं उनको मॉनिटर करना उन को मेंटेन करना कि हमारा जो मैं पेज शो प्रॉपरली रोल हुआ या नहीं हुआ है और अगर
5:31
कोई प्रॉब्लम आ रही है तो उसका नोटिफिकेशन समय देना और उसके पिछे अब हमें बताना कि
5:37
साइड से उसको प्रबल शूट कर सकते हैं इन सारी चीजों में जो Google सर्च कंसोल कार्टून हमारी हेल्प करता है पांच विडियो
5:45
रिपोर्ट सौरव कैन मेक योर प्रेजेंस इन सर्च इंजन अभी किस टाइप की रिपोर्ट हमें देता है सबसे पहली और सबसे इंपोर्टेंट
5:51
रिपोर्ट होती इसके लिए हम लोग प्राइमरी बेसिस पर गूगल सर्च कंसोल को यूज करते हैं
5:56
मतलब बहुत इंपोर्टेंट यूज है Google सर्च कंसोल का कि हम मैच्योर छाते कि हमारे भाई
6:01
यह वेबसाइट के ऊपर डेढ़ सौ पेजेस थे अब मेरे को बताओ मेरे कितने पेजेस करा हुए
6:06
मेरे को बताओ कितने पेजेस मेरे इंडेक्स हुए तो यह जो इन्फॉर्मेशन है कि हमारी वेबसाइट की जो क्वालिटी का स्टेटस है वह
6:13
क्या इंडेक्स बिल्टी का जो स्टेटस वह क्या यह सबसे इंपोर्टेंट इनफार्मेशन होती है जो हमें गूगल सर्च कंसोल देता है उसके बाद
6:20
रीड एक सिंह मुझे लगा कि भाई मेरे यह पट्टी लपेट था इसके ऊपर मैंने कुछ कांटेक्ट में चेंजेस किए में कुछ अपडेशन
6:28
कि तो गूगल क्या करता है जो पहला जो आपका पुराना पेज था उसके ऊपर गूगल आया था उस पर
6:33
स्कैन किया था स्कैन करने के बाद उस पर कॉन्टेक्ट कर लिया था कुछ इंफोर्मेशन के साथ अपने क्या पेजेस में कुछ चेंजेस कर
6:40
दिए तो आप फिर भी जाओगे कि गूगल का ट्रोलर फिर से मेरे पेज को इंडेक्स करें तो झाइयों में रिडक्शन वगैरह कराना पड़ता है
6:46
तो उसके लिए भी जो Google सर्च कंसोल कार्टून है वह यूज होता है परफॉर्मेंस कि बहुत सारी रिपोर्ट जो है वह गूगल सर्च में
6:52
देता है किस टाइप की परफॉरमेंस देखो गूगल सर्च कंसोल का जो काम है ना वह यह है यहां पर अगर आप देखोगे कि Google सर्च कंसोल के
7:00
वर्क यहां पर जूस गूगल सर्च इंजन रिजल्ट
7:05
पेजेस में आपके रिजल्ट्स को डिस्प्ले कराना है उसमें क्या समस्या है यह मेन चीज
7:10
है जो है ना वह गूगल सर्च कंसोल के अंदर हम लोग इनका सलूशन देखते हैं इससे रिलेटिड हम लोग एयरपोर्ट से टिप्स तो गूगल सर्च
7:17
इंजन रिजल्ट पेज में कोई बंदा क्या कुड़ी कर रहा है कोई नहीं करने के बाद आपका कौन
7:22
सा पेज दिखा पेज लिखने के बाद उसके इंप्रेशंस कितने हुए उसके बाद उसके ऊपर क्लिक कितने आए कहां से क्लिक सारे यह
7:29
सारी इन्फॉर्मेशन है इट कम्स अंडर तक पर्फॉर्मेंस टैब ऑफ गूगल सर्च कंसोल तो यह
7:35
आपकी वेबसाइट की परफॉर्मेंस बताता है कहां पर गूगल सर्च इंजन रिजल्ट इसमें ऐसा मत
7:41
समझना कि हमारी वेबसाइट की पर्फॉर्मेंस है वह यूजर्स हमारी वेबसाइट पर कैसा परफॉर्म करें यह बताता है Google सर्च कंसोल यह
7:48
बिल्कुल नहीं बताता है यूजर का इंटरेक्शन आपकी वेबसाइट ऊपर कैसा है यह गूगल सर्च कंसोल भी बताता है कि यूजर किस लोकेशन से
7:56
आया ठीक है यूजर ने आपके वेबसाइट पर क्या किया यह सारे स्पोर्ट्स आपको Google सर्च कंसोल नहीं देता है सारी रिपोर्ट आपको
8:02
गूगल एनालिटिक्स देता है Google सर्च कंसोल का काम होता है है कि भाई साहब आपकी
8:08
वेबसाइट या आपका वेब पेज वेबसाइट भी नहीं घर में व्यक्ति शब्द यूज बहुत ज्यादा सही रहेगा कि हमारा वेब पेज इन गूगल सर्च इंजन
8:15
रिजल्ट बीच में कैसा परफॉर्म कर रहा है कोई पेज 10 बार देखा अच्छा पांच बार क्लिक
8:20
है ओके तो 10 इंप्रेशंस है पांच क्लिक हुए यह रिपोर्ट आपको मिलेगी इस वर्ष रिकॉर्ड परफॉर्मेंस रिपोर्ट और आफ्टर एडवडर्स राइट
8:29
क्लियर हो गया तो यह वाली चीज भी हमें यहां पर मिलती है यह वाली इन्फॉर्मेशन हमें मिलती है अगर कुछ टाइमिंग हो रही है
8:36
ठीक है कोई आपका जो पेज है उसके ऊपर अगर कोई माल वगैरह आ गया है ठीक है आपकी
8:42
वेबसाइट पर माल वगैरह गया है कुछ करप्ट हो गए अगर आपके पीछे तो यह सारी इन्फॉर्मेशन है यह आपको मिलती है ठीक है लिटिल
8:49
इंफॉर्मेशन अबाउट बैकिंग डिटेल इंफॉर्मेशन तो नहीं मिलती है बैक लीव्स कि आपको Google assistant साल के अंदर थोड़ी बहुत
8:55
आपको इंफॉर्मेशन नहीं जाती बट फिर बैकलिंक इंफॉर्मेशन के लिए हमें दूसरे जो पेट टूल्स वगैरह है उन लुट कर लेता है बहुत
9:00
सारे फ्री टूल्स है जो कुछ ट्रायल वर्ज़न वगैरह के लिए यूज होते हैं उनको अमल यूज कर लेते हैं और उनके तो हम लोग मेकेनिक जो
9:07
रिपोर्ट है वह निकाल लेते हैं एक्चुअली पेट उसकी तरफ हमें समझाना चाहिए जहां पर कुछ ठीक-ठाक प्रोजेक्ट हो यह मैं कुछ टाइम
9:13
आ रहा हूं इस वेबसाइट से इनिशियली आपको पेट की तरफ जाने की जरूरत नहीं आंटी आलम ने सब्सक्राइब बहुत बड़ी ना हो अगर आपके
9:20
वेबसाइट बहुत बढ़िया बहुत सारी सर्विस वगैरह अगर आप ऑफर कर उस पर्टिकुलर कि
9:25
इसमें तो आपको पेट्रोल की तरफ जाने पड़ेगा कि वह सारी चीजें आपकी जो आपके नॉर्मल टूल्स होते हैं उनसे नहीं हो पाएंगी उसके
9:32
बाद यह साइट मेक्सिको इंडेक्स को गहरा कराने में भी आपकी हेल्प करता है सिक्योरिटी वगैरह से रिलेटेड बहुत सारी
9:37
आपको अपडेट्स देता है तो आए डिलीवरी आपको समझ में आ गया होगा कि सर्च कंसोल का प्रपंच गया था क्यों सर्च कंसोल जैसे
9:44
टूल्स है वह एग्जिट करता है और गाइस मैं बात करो एक्चुअली गूगल सर्च कंसोल टूल के
9:49
बारे में ऐसा नहीं कि केवल गूगल के पास ही अपना सर कंट्रोल टूल है जो भी दूसरे सर्च इंजन है जैसे घर में बात करो ब्रिंग तो
9:56
विंग का भी अपना जो है वेबमास्टर टूल है इसका पहले पूछ है Google सर्च कंसोल का
10:01
गूगल वेबमास्टर टूल ही था तो बैंक के पास है अपना पिन कंट्रोल है यह बींस काजोल के अभिनय वेबमास्टर टूल का हेलो आप तो वह भी
10:08
है तो अगर हम बिंदुओं पर अपनी वेबसाइट को रन कर आना चाहिए हमें हमारी वेबसाइट को विंग के जो सच है उसके अंदर सबमिट करना
10:14
पड़ेगा फाइट डब्लू और आपको चीजें क्लियर हो गई होंगी कि यह सर्च कंसोल का फंडा
10:19
क्या है और इसके फंडामेंटल्स क्या है तो कोई हम लोग गूगल सर्च कंसोल के ऊपर
10:25
अपनी वेबसाइट को सबमिट करने जाते हैं या हम लोग इसको यह है कि हम अपनी प्रॉपर्टी को सबमिट करने जाते हैं वेबसाइट को यहां
10:31
पर प्रॉपर्टी सबसे भी बोला जाता है जो कि हम सबमिट करने जाते तो हमें दो ऑप्शंस मिलते गूगल सर्च कंसोल के अंदर सबसे पहला
10:36
ऑप्शन होता है कि हमें उस प्रॉपर्टी को एब्डोमेन जो है वह सेट अप करना है या फिर हमें उस प्रॉपर्टी को sur1 प्रशिक्षु है
10:44
वह सेट अप करना है तो आज के इस वीडियो में हम लोग किसी चीज को समझने वाले कि आखिर इन दोनों में डिफरेंस जो है वह क्या है और
10:50
कौन सा तरीका हमें कब अपनाना चाहिए हम लोग डिटेल में समझेंगे कुछ कंफ्यूजन भी बहुत
10:56
सारे लोग रहते हैं उनको भी हम लोग यहां पर डिस्कस करने कुछ करेंगे हे बिदाई ज्यादा
11:01
गूगल सर्च कंसोल के ऊपर जब गूगल संस्थानों पर आएंगे और आपने लॉग-इन नहीं किया होगा तो आपको सबसे पहले इंटरफेस कुछ इस टाइप
11:07
इंटरफेस दिखता है यह बिगनर्स के लिए आपको सिंपली स्टॉलों पर क्लिक करना है जैसे आप स्टॉलों पर क्लिक करेंगे क्योंकि इस
11:13
पर्टिकुलर ID से मैंने पहले कोई भी जो प्रॉपर्टी है वह नहीं बनाई हुई है यहां पर या कोई भी मैंने अकाउंट नहीं बनाया यहां
11:20
पर इसलिए अपने आपको इस टाइप का इंटरफेस दिखाई दे रहा है वरना अगर आपने ऑलरेडी यहां पर कोई प्रॉपर्टी वेबसाइट सबमिट कर
11:26
रखी होती है तो फिर यहां पर जो आपको दिखाता को बेसिकली उस प्रॉपर्टी की इंफॉर्मेशन दिख रही होती है उस प्रॉपर्टी
11:32
डाटा है वह यहां पर आपको दिख रही होगी फादर अगर आपको फिर प्रॉपर्टी ऐड करना तो
11:37
यहां पर जाकर आप प्रॉपर्टी करते हैं तो आपको कंफ्यूज नहीं हो रहा है अगर आपने ऑलरेडी कभी पहले जो है ज्ञान संसार में
11:43
कोई वेबसाइट सबमिट की होगी तो फिर यह वापिस में लॉग इन करेंगे तो आपको उस अ पर्टिकुलर वेबसाइट का या वह जो आपकी
11:50
प्रॉपर्टी होगी स्किन साइट पर दिखाई देंगी और वरदान अगर आप और उसमें प्रॉपर्टीज को ऐड करना चाह हुए ब्रेड प्रॉपर्टी और है
11:57
यहां पर एक चीज मैं आपको दिखा देता हूं कि आपके पास होता है कि आप 1000 प्रॉपर्टीज को यहां पर आउट कर सकते हो पर बट उतनी
12:04
प्रॉपर्टीज ऐड नहीं करते हुए दर ऑप्शंस अब 210 प्रॉपर्टीज आप यहां पर ऐड कर सकते हैं उसके बाद गैस मैं इस चीज की बात कर रहा था
12:11
जबकि आप लोग यहां पर आएंगे तो आपको यह दो ऑप्शन देगा एक तो यह कि आप एसडीओ में
12:16
इंडिया डोमेन लेवल पर जाकर आप अपनी प्रॉपर्टी को यहां पर सबमिट करने या आप url पर फीस के लेवल पर अपनी प्रॉपर्टी को
12:22
सबमिट करने अब दोनों में डिफरेंस को काफी डिटेल में समझने की कोशिश करते थे जो यहां पर अगर आप देखो तो इस इमेज से ही आपको
12:29
क्लेरिटी हो रहा होगा जैसे अगर मैं बात करो अपनी वेबसाइट की रेट से मेरी वेबसाइट है एचटीटीपीएस
12:39
व्यक्ति वेबसाइट और हो सकता है कि मेरी वेबसाइट का जो है वह कोई भी हो सकता है
12:46
मेरी वेबसाइट दूसरा यह मेरी वेबसाइट का दूसरा अर्घ्य
12:52
यह जो कि मैं यहां पर M.Com करके यहां पर
12:58
ठीक है आर्मी डॉट cbse.com करके यहां पर एक मेरा जो है
13:03
सबमिट है तो इस टाइप से डिफरेंट डिफरेंट जो है हमारे वर्ज़ंस आप इसको समझ लो यहां
13:09
पर घर में बात करोगे यह दोनों वर्ष हो गए यहां पर अगर हम बात करें तो यह मोबाइल वर्जन हो गया और यहां पर हम बात करेंगे एक
13:15
सबमिट हो गया तो इस अगर इस टाइप से हमारी वेबसाइट है इस टाइप से डिफरेंट डिफरेंट
13:20
विपरीत हमारे डोमेन के ऊपर शब्दों में मोबाइल वर्जन यह सारी चीजें हैं तो इस
13:26
पर्टिकुलर केस में अगर मैं यहां पर जाता हूं डोरमेंट के ऊपर और अपनी वेबसाइट को या प्रॉपर्टी को डोमेन लेवल पर आठ करता हूं
13:34
यहां पर मुझे सिंपली डोमिनेशन करने का ऑप्शन मिलेगा जैसे अगर आप यहां पर देखो तो आपके पास केवल ऑप्शन आ डोमिनेशन करो इसे
13:41
मैं यहां पर कमीशन करूंगा तोमर व स्किट इन अनशन करूंगा मैं आपको एसटीपी लिखूंगा एडिफिस लिखूंगा नाम लिखूंगा Redmi Note 4
13:48
तस्वीर और को मिलूंगा मैं कुछ भी नहीं लिखूंगा मैं सिंपली क्या करूंगा उम्र तस्वीर डॉट इन यहां पर मिशन करूंगा जो भी
13:54
मेरा डोमेन होगा उसको मैं परमिशन कानून गुड्डन गुड्डन अब
14:00
spider-man के ऊपर जितने भी मोबाइल वर्जन सोंग अगर मैंने मोबाइल सब्डोमेन कुछ बना रखा है मैंने कोई अदर सब लोग मींस बना
14:06
रखें यह मैंने कुछ और जो है वर्जन क्रिएट कर सकते हैं कुछ अंश टीटीपीएस वर्जन है तो
14:12
अगर हम अपनी वेबसाइट को इस पर्टिकुलर डोमेन वाले सेक्शन के अंदर जाकर अपनी प्रॉपर्टी को आर्ट करते हैं तो वहां पर इस
14:20
डोमेन से रिलेटेड जितने भी URL होंगे ठीक है जितने भी साथ रोमांस होंगे वह सभी
14:25
सब्डोमैंस आप समझ लो सभी सब्डोमैंस को सबको आप यहां पर ऐड करो और जब आप इनसाइड
14:31
लिखोगे रिपोर्ट को गिराकर तो उन सब की कलेक्टिव रिपोर्ट आपको मिलेगी तो अच्छा
14:36
तरीका यह भी अच्छा तरीका है बट जब आप इस पर कंटिन्यू करोगे और यहां पर जब आप इसको
14:42
कनेक्ट करने की कोशिश करो मेरी वेबसाइट को शामिल करें कुछ करोगे तो जब हमेशा कुछ समय में कुछ करते थे कुछ वेरीफिकेशन हमसे
14:48
मांगता है url पर एक में हमारे पास मल्टीपल वेरिफिकेशन होते हैं वहीं पर अगर मैं डोरमेंट पर फिक्स की बात करूं तो जो
14:55
मेन परफेक्ट हमारे पास मल्टीपल वेरिफिकेशन नहीं होते हुए दिए थे इस वेरिफिकेशन करना पड़ता इसके लिए हमें अपनी पोस्ट में जाकर
15:01
फिर drs वेरीफिकेशन करना पड़ेगा यह बड़ी बात नहीं करा की वेबसाइट पर आपके पास पोस्टिंग हो गई होगी हम बड़ी आसानी से
15:06
इसको वेरीफाई कर लोगे दूसरा जो ऑप्शन है बट एक्चुअली URL प्रशिक्षु आईपीएस का जो
15:12
मतलब है वह सीधा सा देखिए यहां पर इमेज में भी आपको दिखा है जैसे मान कर चलता हूं मेरी वेबसाइट है bbc.com ठीक है यह मेरी
15:19
वेबसाइट है और इसके अंदर मैंने कुछ इस टाइप से जो है सा फोल्डर बना रखेंगे इसे एक यह है और यह मैंने दूसरा बना रखा है बी
15:27
है ठीक है तो अगर मैं url पर फिक्स में जाकर इस वाले यूआरएल को मिशन करता हूं तो
15:32
यह वाले URL कि मुझे इनसाइड मिलेंगी और इसके बाद जो होंगे युआन जैसे 20 लाश एबीसी
15:39
है तो इसकी मुझे इनसाइड मिलेंगे ऐसा नहीं होने वाला है कि यहां पर एबीसी डॉट कॉम कि मुझे इनसाइड में फाइट घर में स्लाइस एक को
15:46
इस url पर फिक्स इसके अंदर आठ करता हूं तो मुझे इसी के इनसाइट मिलेगी और इसके बाद जो
15:52
यह मेरे बन है उनके इंसाइड टो इंक्वायर भी आपको डिफरेंस क्लियर हो गया होगा अब यहां पर यह बहुत बड़ा कन्फ्यूजन होता है ना लोग
15:59
क्वेश्चंस इधर हम कौन समय खड़ी यूज करें यह वाला मिथलेश यौवन आवेदन अच्छा तो देखो
16:06
सबसे पहले समझने की बात यह है कि इस वाले मेथड ने अपना परपज अलग है ठीक है और इस
16:11
वाले मैटर का अपना पहला है बट एक चीज बहुत ही ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट है वह यह है कि आप दोनों ही मिर्च यूज कर सकते हैं अगर आप
16:17
चाहो तो आप दोनों ही मिर्च यूज कर सकते हैं एग्जांपल के तौर पर बता जैसे आपने क्या किया आपने यह जो आपका जो में यह
16:24
सबमिट कर दिया ठीक है अब इस डोरमेंट ऊपर बहुत सारे वर्जन है जैसे मैंने आपको बताया था कि यहां पर मान लेते हैं एक है एकेडमी
16:31
डॉट बीबीसी डॉट कॉम ठीक है और एक है एबीसी डॉट कॉम स्लैश सर्विस अब आपको यह लग रहा
16:38
है कि यहां पर जो आप रिपोर्ट देखोगे जवा अपने डोमेन में जाकर उसको प्रॉपर्टी को अपनी आर्ट कि यहां पर डोमेन सेटिंग्स के
16:45
रूप तो आपको यह पूरा एबीसी का दिखाएगा आपको कि यह एबीसी के जितने भी वायरल बन
16:51
रहे चाहे वह सब डोरमेंट बन रहे हो चाहे वह यहां पर आगे बन रहे हैं ठीक है इसमें सब डिक्रीज वगैरह में बन रहे हैं कितने भी
16:58
वायरस बने हुए हैं वहीं की कंबाइंड रिपोर्ट आपको दिखाएगा तो इतने इंप्रेशन सहित में एक क्लिक से इतनी कोई सुपर इतने
17:04
इंप्रेशंस है वह सारी आपको यह कंबाइन रिपोर्ट के फॉर्म में दिखाया था बट वहीं पर 1431 में जाएंगे तो हम चाहे तो इसको हम
17:10
url पर फीस में भी ऐड कर सकते हैं जैसे मैंने क्या किया था पर फीट से बने यहां पर एबीसी डॉट कॉम जो है डोमेन लेवल पर जाकर
17:17
मैंने एडिट करके उसके बाद मैं चाहता हूं यह bbc.com स्लाइस एकेडमी अगर यह है तो
17:23
मैं यहां पर जाकर url पर फिट में डिसाइड कर सका तो अब मैं यहां पर ट्रैफिक के थ्रू जब मैं यहां पर जाऊंगा तो मुझे दोनों
17:30
प्रॉपर्टी दिखाई देंगे यहां पर दिखाई देगा कि मेरी डोरमेंट प्रॉपर्टी कौन सी है ऐड मुझे दिखाई देगी कि मेरी जो url पर फीस
17:37
प्रॉपर्टी है वह कौन सी है तो जब मैं यूआरएल प्रॉपर्टीज ऊपर जाऊंगा तो मुझे इसकी इनसाइड और इसके बाद वाले जो URL समय
17:44
यहां से जो परिवार अलार्म्स बनेंगे उनकी जो इनसाइड सब मुझे दिखाई नहीं उनकी जो रिपोर्ट से उनके दिखाई नहीं तो आपको यह
17:51
नहीं सोचना है कि मुझे जो मैंने यूज करना चाहिए मुझे url पर फिक्स यूज करना ही
17:57
दोनों का पर फलक है आप किस तरीके डाटा को देखना चाहते हैं आप किस तरीके से डाटा को
18:02
समझना चाहते हैं कि आपके ऊपर अब आप में मान कर चलते हैं आपने एबीसी डॉट कॉम डोमेन वाले मेथड के थ्रू आप यहां पर वेरिफिकेशन
18:09
करा लिया और इस तरीके से अपनी प्रॉपर्टी को ऐड कर दिया आप चाहते हो आप इसको स्टडी करना ठीक है तो भई यह इन्फॉर्मेशन तो आपको
18:18
मिलेगी क्योंकि डोरमेंट तो सब कुछ जो है वह पिक कर लेता है और सब की जो आपको
18:23
रिपोर्ट है इनसाइड तो आपको दे सकता है पर इसके लिए सिर्फ अगर आप यहां पर प्रिंटर जो है वह लगाएंगे तो प्रिंटर आगे फिर आप यहां
18:30
पर इसको स्टडी कर पाओगे या इसकी जो इनसाइड से रिपोर्ट जो है वह देख पाओगे तभी आपको क्लेरिटी हो रही है कि धोबी में डीटॉक्स
18:36
बहुत सारी आपको देखने को मिल जाएगी बट आपको फोल्डर लगाने पड़ेंगे आपको मैसेज टेक्स्ट करनी पड़ी क्योंकि सब कुछ है पर
18:43
अगर आप सिंपलीफाइड वर्जन में चीजों को समझना चाहिए आपके रिक्वायरमेंट केवल उसी वायरल की है उस रिक्शा रिवोल्यूशन के
18:50
ब्लॉन्ड केवल आपकी रिक्वायरमेंट है तो उस पर्टिकुलर कि इसमें आप इसको कर सकते थे एक और धमाल बताता हूं जैसे आपकी वेबसाइट है
18:58
बहुत इंपोर्टेंट एग्जांपल है कि आपकी वेबसाइट है ebiz.com ठीक है इसको आपने
19:03
क्या किया इसको अपने डोमेन मेथड से जो है आपने वेरिफिकेशन कर दिया अब आप रेगुलर
19:08
बेसिस पर अपने ब्लॉग पर बहुत काम करोगे तो ब्लॉक क्योंकि इसी का पाठ इसी वेबसाइट का
19:14
पाठ स्लाइड वक्त उसकी इन्फॉर्मेशन यहां पर है और आपने कम है तो बहुत रेगुलर ने ब्लाक के ऊपर काम करो रोल्स हमारे ब्लाउस जा रहे
19:20
हैं वह सारे ट्रैफिक ब्लॉक के ऊपर आघवें देखना चाहता हूं तो मैं चाहता हूं उसको मैं इसे प्लेट जो है प्रॉपर्टी बिल्कुल
19:27
देखो ताकि बस को बेहतर तरीके से जो है वह स्टडी कर सकूं तो आपने क्या किया आपने यहां एबीसी डॉट कॉम स्लैश क्लॉक को इन
19:35
यूआरएल प्रीफिक्स के अंदर जाकर आपने फाड़ कर दिया ठीक है अगर आप यहां पर जाकर ऐड कर
19:40
दोगे तो अब यह ब्लॉग वाला जो आप समझ सकते क्लॉक एक्सेप्ट ना गूगल सर्च कंसोल की प्रॉपर्टी आपकी बन गई है और इससे आप इसकी
19:48
पूरी जो रिसर्च है नाले से जो है रिकॉर्ड जो है वह आप देख सकते हैं कि आपको पसंद है कि अब हमें किस चीज की जरूरत होती है तो
19:55
आप यह कर सकते हो यह कर सकते हो ऐसा नहीं है कि इसमें आपको कुछ डाटा हो जाएगी और
20:00
इसमें कुछ डाटा एक्स्ट्रा जाएगी यहां पर कुछ डाटा मिक्स हो जाए यहां पर कुछ डाटा एक्स्ट्रा जाएगी ऐसा कुछ भी नहीं है डाटा
20:06
वहीं रहती जिसे मानकर चलता हूं कि अगर मैंने यहां पर एबीसी डॉट कॉम को रखा व
20:11
स्लाइस ब्लॉग की जो भी इन्फॉर्मेशन जो मैं यहां दिखेंगी वहीं मुझे यहां भी दिखेगी बट केवल रिप्रेजेंटेशन का डिफरेंस है अवनी
20:19
अभी आपको चीजें क्लियर हो गई होंगी और जब पहली बार ओलंपिक में या 2 मिनट में मेथड
20:24
में जाकर आप फैट सबमिट करें कुछ करते हो तो जो वेरिफिकेशन के मेथड होते हैं वह डिफरेंट होता बट यह एक वन टाइम प्रोसेस को
20:30
पर प्रैक्टिकल यह आपको बहुत से अलग-अलग तरीके से अलग टाइप ओं वेबसाइट फ्रॉम दिल्ली कैसे करेंगे सारी चीजें आपको ही
20:36
करें बता दूंगा ताकि किसी भी ड्राइव साइटों पर अगर आप काम करोगे जाकर भविष्य में तो फिर आपको कोई प्रॉब्लम नहीं होगी
20:41
ठीक है जो मैंने आपको एक्सप्लेन किया उसी को मैंने यह जो Google का सपोर्ट डॉक्यूमेंट होते हैं वहीं से लिया गया यह
20:47
इनसाइड से थोड़ी सी या पॉइंट्स हैं जो आप देख सकते हो इस मैंने पॉइंट मंचन किया था यू कैन अर्न अप टो 100 प्रॉपर्टीज इन गूगल

करेंगे उस वक्त आपने एसिड लिया था और महीने-दो
21:58
महीने में कि आपको लगा कि मुझे ट्यूसडे राज्य आपने टीपीएस लिया तो आप आपकी जो
22:04
वेबसाइट है वह इस टीवीएस पर अगर आपकी हो जाएगी तो आपको फिर से क्योंकि यह URL अलग
22:09
हो गया ना जैसे अगर आपकी वेबसाइट है 1st पीयूसी इस्लाम शुड बी सी डॉट कॉम और आपकी
22:17
वेबसाइट का यूआरएल है वह टीटीपीएस लेबल c.com तो गूगल की नजर में यह दो डिफरेंट
22:23
यूअर अनुसार यह क्या है नहीं है गूगल की नजर में यह दूर डिफरेंट URL से तो जब आप
22:28
इसको सबमिट करते हो आज url पर फिक्स तो इसकी डेट आपको नहीं दिखाई देगी तो जब कई
22:34
बार दें अगर आपने टीवीएस किया तो आपको फिर से सबमिट करना पड़ेगा क्यों क्योंकि जवा अपने सीटीपीएस कर दिया तो फिर इस की जो
22:41
इन्फॉर्मेशन वह अलग हो गई अब इसकी जो इन्फॉर्मेशन है वह अ लगे तो आइडिया भी चीज मैं आपको समझ में आ रही होंगी कि दो
22:48
अलग-अलग चीज हैं पॉइंट यह होता है हमारा जब हम url पर फिक्स प्रॉपर्टी में रखते
22:53
हैं दो मैन प्रॉपर्टी में आपको सारी जितनी भी इन्फॉर्मेशन है वह सारी की सारी इन्फॉर्मेशन आपको दिखाई देती है उसी तरह
23:00
जरा देखोगे यहां पर तो आपको यहां पर ट्रिपल डब्ल्यू डॉट भी दिख रहा है ठीक है तो यह ट्रेडिशनल चीज आ गई हमने ऐड यह किया
23:06
था प्रॉपर्टी तो इसलिए भी ना मैच नहीं करेगा देखकर आप भी मैच नहीं करेगा और इसकी जो इनसाइड से वह आपको नहीं दिखाई देंगे तो
23:13
यह आपके ऊपर डिपेंड करता है कि आप किस तरीके से रिपोर्ट्स है उनको देखना चाहते हो उसके बेसिस पर आप यहां पर यह
23:18
प्रशिक्षित प्रॉपर्टी डोमेन प्रॉपर्टी जो है वह आप सेट करो गे अगर आप एक बार डोमेन
23:24
प्रॉपर्टी सेट कर देते हो तो एक चीज आप फ्री हो जाते हो कि ऐसा तो नहीं है कि कोई डाटा हमारी मिसोरी सारी की सारी हमारी
23:30
डाटा है वह आप Google सर्च कंसोल के अंदर है फिल्टर लगा-लगा कर भून लेंगे ठीक है छुआरे प्रीफिक्स कि अगर आपने प्रॉपर्टी
23:35
सबमिट करी तो फिर आपके जो सब्डोमैंस वगैरह बनेंगे उनकी इंफॉर्मेशन ऑफ कितनी जाएगी और उसके लिए आपको फर्ज है ना वृक्ष पर दूसरी
23:43
प्रॉपर्टीज आफ तो ऐड करनी पड़ेगी या फिर आपको डबल प्रॉपर्टी की तरीके से फोल्ड करना पड़ेगा
23:49
रिव्यु देखने वाले किस तरीके से हम लोग हमारी वेबसाइट को URL प्रोफेसर वाले मेथड
23:55
को यूज करके गूगल सर्च कंसोल के अंदर सबमिट कर सकते हैं तो जैसा कि आप देख सकते हो मेरे तब स्किन के ऊपर हमारे जो Google
24:01
सर्च कंसोल ट्रांसपोर्ट है वह जैसे आप इसके ऊपर जाएंगे और न्यू प्रॉपर्टी को आउट करने के लिए जाएंगे आपको यह दो ऑप्शन
24:08
दिखाई देते हैं तो यह जो हमारा डोमेन वाला मेथड इसको लोग बाद में डिस्कस करेंगे पहले हम लोग देख लेते हैं url पर फिक्स के
24:13
बेसिस पर किस तरीके से हम लोग अपनी वेबसाइट को सबमिट कर सकते हैं तो कि जहां पर आप देख रहे हैं आपको सबसे पहले आधा
24:19
यूआरएच वह मेंशन करना हमारी वेबसाइट जरूर ओपन कर लेते हैं जैसे कि आप देख रहे दिसावर डेमो वेबसाइट कि हमारी डेमो
24:25
वेबसाइट है तो हम इस वेबसाइट को ओपन कर लेते हैं और इस वेबसाइट का यूआरएल हम लोग क्लिक कर लेंगे फाइन और इसको हम लोग यहां
24:32
पर मीडियम कर देंगे अब ध्यान से आप समझने की कोशिश करो यहां पर देखिए लिखा हुआ एसटीडी-पीसीओ झंडा बल्लालेश्वर तस्की डॉट
24:39
एक्स वाई सी अगर मेरा ब्लॉग होता है इस प्रॉब्लम वेबसाइट के ऊपर और मैं चाहता हूं
24:44
कि ब्लॉग और ब्लाक के बाद जो यह वायरल हमारे बने मतलब लॉक के अंदर हमारी यह यौवन है हम केवल उनको चाहते हैं कि हम वहां से
24:52
केवल अपनी प्रॉपर्टी को आर्ट करें गूगल सर्च कंसोल केंद्रों में इसका ऐड करना था उस पर्टिकुलर कि इसमें हमें इस साइड करते
24:58
तो फिर यहां पर इस पर्टिकुलर URL के ऊपर जो के world.so इजी तरीका है यह माय होम
25:04
पेज वाला जो हमारी वायरल इसके ऊपर कोई इंटरेक्शंस ओर है इसकी जो रिपोर्ट्स हैव जो सचिन-जिगर है कि रिपोर्ट्स कितना
25:11
इंप्रेशन है कितने क्लिक है यह सारी हमें नहीं दिखाई दिए कि उन लोगों ने इसको ही वाली फीस में रखा हुआ है तो फॉर नऊ हम यह

30:02
सकते हैं विद द हेल्प ऑफ डी एन एस वेरिफिकेशन मेथड टो इसको देखेंगे पिछले वीडियो में हम लोग यह समझने की कोशिश करें
30:09
कि किस तरीके से हम लोग url पर फिक्स वाले मेथड को यूज करके हमारी वेबसाइट को सबमिट कर सकते गूगल सर्च कंसोल केंद्र वे यहां
30:16
पर आप देख सकते हैं मेरे लैपटॉप स्क्रीन के ऊपर मुझे यहां पर प्रॉपर्टी टिप्स लेकर है जो कि मैं यहां पर डोरमेंट सेलेक्ट कर
30:21
रखा है और यहां से फिर मैं अपनी जो वेबसाइट है उसको मैं एक बार के लिए पिक कर लेता हूं हमारी डेमो वेबसाइट है और इसका

31:53
कभी कभी 15 20 मिनट अभी आधा घंटा में मैंने देखा हुआ अपना एक्सपीरियंस से ही लग जाता है हमारा जो प्रॉपर्टी है डिफाइन

इसमें तुरंत कर दिया यहां पर वे क्रॉप डोमेन नेम प्रोवाइडर वेरिफिकेशन मठ में आप देखेंगे यहां पर कई बार ऐसा होता है यह
33:19
थोड़ा सा टाइम लगा देता है और आपको कंजूस नहीं होना उससे भी परेशान है हो सकता है कि मैंने पहले भी यहां पर जाए url पर फीट
33:26
को यूज कर रखा है इसलिए हो सकता है कि उसने तुरंत करिए बट कई बार मैं नहीं वेबसाइट पूजा करता हूं देखता हूं थोड़ा टाइम लग जाता है 15वीं कभी लग जाते हैं
33:33
उसके बाद जिसमें आप बटन पर क्लिक करता हूं और बटन पर क्लिक करने के बाद अगर मैं यहां पर वापस आ जाऊं तो आप देखोगे जो हम लोगों
33:40
ने दो प्रॉपर्टीज आमदनी हुई है1 उन्होंने url पर बिछा लें मेथड से कटी जो कि आपको
33:46
यहां पर दिख रही url पर बिछा ली और डोमेनवाले आप देखिए यहां पर देखिए फाइट यह दोनों सेपरेट है अब डोमेनवाले में अगर
33:52
मेरा कोई शब्दों में वगैरह होगा तो उसकी भी इनसाइड मुझे यहां पर दिखाई देंगे यहां पर आ जाता हूं अगर ठीक है कि हमने नया यह
33:59
ऐड यहां पर अभी जो रिपोर्ट सबमिट पापुलेट नहीं थोड़ा टाइम लगेगा अब हम यहां पर इसके
34:04
सब्डोमेन कि शीघ्र ही अपनी रिपोर्ट देंगे यहां पर हमें नहीं
34:10
मिली कि किस तरीके से हम लोग को
34:17
सब्सक्राइब करें हम लोग फ्रंट
34:25
सब्सक्राइब का यूज करते हैं आप किसी को
34:32
सबस्क्राइब होता है कि आप लोगों को प्रॉपर्टी वेबसाइट
34:40
पर और
34:45
सब्सक्राइब के अंदर हम लोग किसी दूसरी साइड को इस तरीके से चाहिए उन्हें साइन
34:52
करने चाहिए सब्सक्राइब करें
35:00
सिंपल का ऑप्शन है कि आप अपनी प्रॉपर्टी का जो एक्सेस है वह किसी दूसरे ID के ऊपर
35:06
दे रहे बस इतनी चीज होती है बट क्यों दे रहा है अब हमें देना चाहिए यह सब्सक्राइब थोड़े और क्लियर हो जाएगी यहां पर
35:14
सबस्क्राइब के ऊपर मेरे पास यह आप इसको है
35:20
और इसके ऊपर मेरा सब्सक्राइब और इसके अंदर मैंने दो प्रॉपर्टीज को
35:29
अघ्र्य सकता है यह वाली एजेंसी की हो तो यह हो सकता है कि इसके ऊपर यहां पर बहुत
35:37
सारे जो प्रॉपर्टीज है उनका बट आप किसी दूसरे को किसी प्रॉपर्टी
35:43
चाहिए तो आप यह नहीं चाहेंगे कि आप उसको यह यूजर नेम और पासवर्ड अगर आपने ऐसा कर दिया
35:51
तो क्या होगा उसको गूगल सर्च के साथ-साथ हो सकता है इसके ऊपर है ठीक है उनका घ्र
36:00
दात वह आपके पिंपल्स को भी पड़ सकता है आपके गूगल ऐडसेंस अकाउंट को भी देख सकता है जो कुछ भी जो कुछ भी इस पर्टिकुलर गूगल
36:07
Idea ऊपर होगा वह सब का अक्सर उसके पास चला जाएगा अगर आपने उसको इसका यूजर नेम और
36:12
पासवर्ड दे दिया प्राइवेसी का इशू है तो हर प्लेटफॉर्म इस टाइप का फीचर दे रखा है
36:17
ताकि आपको यूजर नेम और पासवर्ड न देना पड़े आप बस उनको अपनी प्रॉपर्टी का एक्सेस
36:23
देंगे वहीं लिमिटेड कंट्रोल के साथ अब लिमिटेड कंट्रोल में क्यों गर्व देखो मैं आपको बहुत ही प्रैक्टिकल एक्जाम फल बताता
36:29
हूं बहुत सारे बिजनेस हस जिनके लिए हम वर्क करते हैं जिनकी हम डिजिटल मार्केटिंग
36:34
स्ट्रेटजी डिवाइस करते हैं जिन्हें हम जितने मागणी प्रोजेक्ट करते हैं कई बार ऐसा होता है कि जब हमें कोई रिपोर्ट पेश
36:41
करनी होती है प्रोपोर्शंस बनाने होते हैं अपने जो प्रोस्पेक्टस हैं उनके लिए उस
36:46
वक्त हमें गूगल सर्च कंसोल कि कुछ इन साइट्स की जरूरत होती है हमें कुछ इन्फॉर्मेशन गूगल सर्च कंसोल से भी चाहिए
36:52
कि जैसे कि किस पर्टिकुलर पर इसके ऊपर अभी आप रैंक हो रही है कि इस पर्टिकुलर क्वेश्चन इज से कितने क्लिक आपको सचिन पेज
37:00
में मिले ऐसी कुछ बेसिक जो रिकॉर्ड हमें चाहिए उसके ऊपर हम कुछ कंक्रीट और सॉलिड
37:05
प्रपोजल सॉलिड नंबर को बताया हम कुछ स्टीमेट जो है वह उनको मैथमेटिकली
37:11
जस्टिफाइड है वह इसके लिए जरूरी होता है कि वह अपने गूगल सर्च कंसोल
37:17
अब यह जरूरी नहीं है कि यह हरेक खड़े होते जहां पर नंबर्स बहुत मायने रखते
37:25
हैं जो भी चीज उनको इंफॉर्मेशन
37:30
इंफॉर्मेशन होनी चाहिए कुछ भी नहीं सकते तो ऐसे हमें थोड़ा बहुत जो है एक चाहिए तो
37:39
इस वेबसाइट पर
37:47
इन्फॉर्मेशन मिल जाए और अब तो यह देखिए इस
37:54
तरीके से हमें ऑप्शन मिल सके
38:00
कि उम्र का और थर्ड हमें रिस्ट्रिक्टेड एक्सेस मिलता है तो वह इस पर्टिकुलर केस में हमें केवल रिस्ट्रिक्टेड एक ही देगा
38:07
ठीक है अगर उस मेरी बात समझ में आती है और उसे लगता है कि रिस्ट्रिक्टेड एक्सेस देना भी सिर्फ है जो कि कहीं कुछ हद तक टेक
38:14
होता है क्योंकि उसमें मैं उनकी प्रॉपर्टी के अंदर बहुत ज्यादा चेंजेस नहीं कर सकता
38:19
बस रिपोर्ट्स को म्यूट कर सकता हूं तो अगर बिजनेस ओनर को यह लगता है कि ठीक है एजेंसी रिपोर्ट की तो देख रही है कोई बड़ी
38:25
प्रॉब्लम जी आपने तो हमें एक्सेस दे सकते हैं रिस्ट्रिक्शन तो एडम्स बहुत सारे बनते
38:32
जहां पर ही जो एक्सेस का ऑप्शन है काफी इंपोर्टेंट हो जाता है उसके बाद मान लेते
38:37
हैं कि मेरा प्रपोजल जो है वह लाइन को समझ में आ गया यह मेरी बात चीज है वह आगे बढ़ गई तो उस पर्टिकुलर केस में वह फिर हमें
38:44
फुल एक्सेस देंगे ठीक है और एक्टर तब भी नहीं देंगे क्यों नहीं अभी मैं आपको बताऊंगा तब हमें फ्लेक्स देंगे ताकि हमें
38:51
अगर कुछ साइटमैप्स वगैरह ऐड करने हैं कुछ पेजेस कोड वगैरह करना है तो उसमें हमें कोई प्रॉब्लम है तो अभी आपको बात समझ में
38:57
आ रही है कि ऑप्शंस क्यों बीइंग हैं अब हम इन्हें यूज करना है किस तरीके से हम कर सकते हैं यह भी मैं आपको क्लियर कर देखो
39:04
यहां पर मैं आ चुका हूं अपनी प्रॉपर्टी के ऊपर तो मैं यहां से एक अपनी url पर फिक्स
39:10
वाली प्रॉपर्टीज है ना उसको सेलेक्ट कर लेता आप कोई भी प्रॉपर्टी आप सेलेक्ट कर लें ठीक है जो भी आपकी प्रॉपर्टी और उसके
39:15
बाद आपको क्या करना है यहां पर आपको सेटिंग्स में लेट से महसूस न हो और मुझे किसी को एक्सेस देना है तो यहां पर अगर आप
39:22
यूज एन परमिशंस के ऊपर जाएंगे यहां पर आपको देखो आदि यूज़र का ऑप्शन मिल रहा है तो मैं क्या करता हूं मैं मेरे पास एक और
39:28
मेरी आईडी है उसके ऊपर में अक्सर देता हूं तो जैसा कि मैं यहां पर सलेक्ट करूंगा देखो यह तीनों ऑप्शन दे रहे थे वह न तो
39:35
मैं कभी नहीं सजेस्ट करूंगा क्योंकि डोनर में प्रॉब्लम क्या होती रखो अगर आपने किसी को-ओनर का एक्सेस दिया ना तो आप को भी
39:42
रिमूव कर सकते हैं वहां से कुंअर के पास यह रोटी होती है यह कंट्रोल होता है कि वह
39:47
दूसरे यूजर्स हैं उनको रिमूव कर सकता है तो यह तो मैं कभी नहीं सजेस्ट करूंगा आपको
39:52
ठीक है उसके बाद यहां पर फ्लेक्सेस होता है फूल के एक्सेस में जब एजेंसीस फाइनल कर
39:58
लेती है किसी प्रोडक्ट तो उन में काट कर दिया जाता है ताकि वह चीजों को केवल यू ना कर सके बल्कि एडिट बी कर सकें कुछ चेंजेस
40:05
अगर करनी होगी कर सकें रिस्ट्रिक्टेड एक्सेस बड़ा ही लिमिटेड एक्सेस होता है इसमें केवल रिपोर्ट को लागू किया जा सकता
40:12
है तो मैं एक बार फिर इस ट्रैक्टर एक्सेस के साथ रेफ्रेंस देता हूं कि आप चीजों को समझ पाए ठीक है और मैं ऐड कर देता हूं
40:18
इसमें पॉइंट तो यहां पर मैंने अपनी प्रॉपर्टी का रिस्ट्रिक्टेड टो एक्सेस दे दिया और यहां पर देखिए आपको रिस्ट्रिक्टेड
40:24
एक्सेस का यहां पर यूजर के नीचे आपको पता भी चल रहा है अगर हम लोग इस पर्टिकुलर
40:29
अपनी आईडी के ऊपर जाएं इसको पर हमने इस दिया और मैं एक बार रिक्वेस्ट करता हूं और यहां तो मैं देखो आप प्रॉपर्टी को सेलेक्ट
40:36
कर सकता हूं ठीक है प्रॉपर्टी को सेलेक्ट करने के बाद क्योंकि यहां पर रिस्ट्रिक्टेड एक्सेस है तो क्या मैं साइट
40:42
मैथ्स को आउट कर सकूं चलो देखते हैं तुम्हें साइटमैप्स में जाता हूं यहां पर और अगर आप देखो तो मुझे कोई भी ऑप्शन नहीं
40:49
मिला यहां पर सबमिट करने का साइटमैप वहीं अगर आप यहां पर देखिए यहां पर मेरे पास फ्लेक्सीड मेरे पास ऑप्शन है साइड में
40:55
एडमिट करने का वहीं अगर मैं रिमूवल्स में चला जाऊं तो यहां पर मैं रिमूवल्स के लिए लुट प्रेस कर सकता हूं बट यहां पर मैं
41:02
रिमूवल्स के लिए रिक्वेस्ट नहीं प्रेस कर पाऊंगा देखो आपको यहां ऑप्शन नहीं दिख रहा है ग्रेड है यह मैं कुछ नहीं कर सकता फाइट
41:08
लीग यह डिफरेंट डिफरेंट सिनेरियस होते जहां पर हमें इन एक्सेस को देना है ठीक है
41:14
उसके बाद मुझे लगता है कि मेरी बातचीत नहीं बनी एजेंसी के साथ यह मेरा काम नहीं होना एजेंसी के साथ सिंपल हम क्या करेंगे
41:19
यह मैसेज सेंड एसोसिएट हो गए सिंपली तो हम यूजर एक्सेस है वह हम रिमूव करने में बहुत
41:25
सारे लोग इस चीज की नॉलेज नहीं
41:30
करूंगा कि यूजर नेम और पासवर्ड आप प्रैक्टिस है कि सिक्योरिटी एजेंसी को
41:38
क्यों करते हो आप कभी भी यूजर नेम और पासवर्ड
41:45
हम सबमिट करते हैं
41:50
तो आइए देखते हैं कि बहुत सारी रिपोर्ट
41:56
के लिए बहुत कंफ्यूजन होता है कि उसे कि रिपोर्ट क्यों पर सबसे ज्यादा ध्यान देना
42:01
है उसे शुरुआत कहां से करनी है कि रिपोर्ट को देखना है और कौन सी रिपोर्ट्स कौन सी इंफॉर्मेशन दे रही हैं और अगर कोई
42:07
ऐरा-गैरा है तो इस तरीके से फोल्ड करना है तो अगर कोई बिजनेस वीडियो को देखा तो मैं आपको रेकमेंड करूंगा कि सबसे पहले तो आपको
42:13
जो कवरेज रिपोर्ट है ना उसी को कवर करना है उसी को समझ लें और उसमें जो इशूज है
42:19
सबसे पहले आपको 19 को सॉल्व करना और उसके बाद आपको दूसरी जो रिपोर्ट है जैसे परफॉर्मेंस की रिपोर्ट्स और वह रिपोर्ट से
42:25
उनके ऊपर आपको जाना है तो सबसे पहले हम समझते हैं कि कब्र इंच जो रिपोर्ट है इंडेक्स वाले सेक्शन कैमरा में देखने को
42:32
मिलती यहां पर भी देख सकते हो आप मेरे लैपटॉप स्क्रीन के ऊपर यहां पर मेरा प्यार है वहीं ठीक है और Google सर्च कंसोल यहां
42:38
पर इंडेक्स वाले सेक्शन के अंदर हमें कवरेज रिपोर्ट दिख रही है और इसके अंदर यह सारी इन्फॉर्मेशन इसको भी मैं डिस्कस करूं
42:44
आपसे बट आखिर क्यों हमें सबसे पहले कवरेज रिपोर्ट को ही समझना चाहिए को रीजन सीधा साए की गूगल सर्च कंसोल कौन क्यों यूज
42:50
करें है ताकि जो कलर है वह हमारी वेबसाइट को और बेहतर तरीके से समझ सके और अगर कुछ
42:56
टिश्यू जा रहे विकास टू कॉलिंग एस वेल एस विद रिगार्ड इंडेक्सिंग तो में पता कैसे
43:01
चलेंगे राइट बीच में गूगल ऐप में डाल दे दिया गूगल सर्च कंसोल के नाम से कि देखो भाई अगर आपकी वेबसाइट के अंदर कुछ कॉलिंग
43:09
से रिलेटेड इश्यूज आ रहे अगर आपने हमारे चैनल को इंडक्टिंग से रिलेटेड सुधार हैं तो हम आपको थ्रू थिस प्लेटफॉर्म आपको
43:15
नोटिफाई कर देंगे अलांग विद दर सजेशंस कि आप यहीं चीज है कर लो तो आपकी जो इशूज है वह साल हो जायेंगे अब हमने अगर वेबसाइट
43:22
बनाई और हम यह सोचा कि हमारी वेबसाइट का एसडीओ करना है तो यह बात तो बाद में आएगी
43:27
कि की मृत्यु पर हमारी वेबसाइट राइट हो रही है क्योंकि वर्ष ऊपर हमारी वेबसाइट नहीं रही खोरी कहां राग पूरी कहानी प्रैंक
43:32
और यह किस पोजीशन पर आखिरी यह सारी बात की चीज है जब तक हमारी वेबसाइट के पीछे गैस इंडेक्स नहीं होंगे यानी वह कवरेज में
43:40
नहीं आएंगे जब तक गूगल उनको डिस्कवर नहीं कर पाएगा कि इन की वेबसाइट पर यह पेज
43:46
सिलेक्ट सर्विस का पेजर फ्लैश कांटेक्ट अस का प्रेशर अगर गूगल को यही नहीं पता चलेगा
43:52
तो आगे की सारी कहानी जो है ना वह तो काम करेगी है ना तो सबसे पहले अगर हमारे पास वेबसाइट होती है और मुकुरु आसनसोल के अंदर
43:59
समेट चाहे तो हमें यह चेक करना होगा कि हमारे जितने भी इंपॉर्टेंट पेजेस है ना वह कवरेज में है भी या नहीं मतलब प्रॉपरली
44:06
इंडेक्स हुए भी है या नहीं हुए ऐसा तो नहीं है कि हम इंपोर्टेंट है जिस किसी भी रिटर्न की वजह से हो सकता है ना इंडेक्स
44:12
हुए ऐसा तो नहीं कि तो इन सारी चीजों की जो में रिपोर्ट है वह में मिलती है कब्ज के अंदर तो आप खुद ही समझ में कुछ करिए कि
44:19
परफोर्मेंस से पहले हमें यह समझने की जरूरत है कि हमारी वेबसाइट का कवरेज जो है
44:24
वह प्रॉपरली हुआ है यह नहीं हुआ या जो हमारी वेबसाइट इंडेक्सिंग है जिन्हें इंपोर्टेंट है जिसको हम रन करना चाहते हो
44:30
कि प्रॉपर हुई है या नहीं हुई है बहुत सारे जो है कैसे अगर अभी आप देखेंगे एग्जांपल मैं आपको बताऊंगा तो आपको पता
44:36
चलेगा कि बहुत सारे केसेस में जो है हमारी वेबसाइट की जो बहुत सारे पहले उनकी
44:42
एक्टिंग नहीं होती है और हम उस चीज को इग्नोर भी कर देते हैं यह में दिसदा चला कि हमारा यह वाला पेज क्यों नहीं इंडेक्स
44:48
हुआ है यह वाला पेज क्यों हमारा एक्सक्लूड कर दिया गया है ठीक है तो वहां पर हम देखते हैं कि अगर यह द प्रिज़न की वजह से
44:54
जो है वह एक्सपोर्ट किया गया तो उसको इग्नोर कर देते हैं पॉइंट्स तो गाइस हम लोग देखेंगे यहां पर के कपड़े गृह में
45:00
क्या देखने को मिलता है तो यहां पर मैंने दो प्रॉपर्टीज ओपन करके मतलब दो कंसोल ओपन कर रखे ताकि मैं आपको डिफरेंस बता सकूं
45:06
नई-नई वेबसाइट से ज़्यादा नहीं यह डेमो टाइट कि Redmi ताकि आप इनको वेबसाइट समझ
45:11
सकते हैं बट पॉइंट्स आपको ध्यान से समझने देखो जब मैं यहां पर आता हूं कवरेज के अंदर तो मैं मेरे को यहां पर सबसे पहले
45:18
ठीक है ऑनलाइन पेजेस और मैं इसको पर क्लिक करता हूं तो मुझे कुछ नहीं दिख रहा है कहने का मतलब कि जितने भी पेज गैस फाइंड
45:25
करें हैं गूगल सर्च कंसोल है वह किस के थ्रू पॉइंट किया क्योंकि आपके पेजेस तक
45:30
पहुंचने के डिफरेंट डिफरेंट सोर्सेस हो सकते हैं जैसे एक तरीका हो सकता है कि बैकलिंक कहीं परमिशन है उसके थ्रू जो
45:37
पेजेस है वह डिस्कवर किए गए हो ऐसा भी हो सकता है कि साइकिलिंग के थ्रू जो पेजेस हैव डिस्कवर्ड की हो तो फिर जो अलग-अलग
45:43
तरीके हैं वह सकते हैं एंड यहां पर आप देख रहे हैं जितने भी पेजेस है जो हमारी वेबसाइट पर इस कपड़े को सभी पेजेस यहां पर
45:49
है कि इतने सारे जो भेजे हैं वह आपकी वेबसाइट में डिस्कवर किए गए हैं कवरेज वाले सेक्शन के अंदर वह आपको दिखाई देंगे
45:56
बट यहीं पर घर में दूसरी वेबसाइट पर जाता हूं तो यहां पर आप देख रहे थे कि आपको जो प्रॉब्लम नहीं दिख रहा है बट यहां पर जो
46:02
आप देखोगे तो आप देखोगे यहां पर ऑनलाइन पेजेस ऑल सबमिट पेजेस कितने हैं और उसके
46:07
बाद अगर आप देखोगे तो साइटमैप जो होता है हमारा उस के थ्रू कितने पेजेस सेक्शन के
46:13
अंदर आए हुए वह भी आप देख सकते हो कि साइटमैप के अंदर भी कुछ चेंजेस होते हैं तो वह जो पहले से वॉइस मीटर पेयर्स में आ
46:20
जाएंगे अगर वाइट ऑल नोन फॉर हिस कोई भी स्पोर्ट्स और कहीं से भी डिस्कवर किया हो बट गूगल ने उन पर जिसको डिस्कवर कर दिया
46:26
तो इसलिए मैंने दो चीजें ओपन करके ताकि आपको जो डिफ्रेंस है ना वह भी प्रॉपरली समझ में आ जाए अब बोलोगे सर यहां पर क्यों
46:32
नहीं दिखा रहा है साइड में यहां पर भी तो दिखाना चाहिए अगर यहां पर आप साइड में हमें दिखा रहे हो यहां पर मिसाइलें दिखाना
46:37
चाहिए अब यहां पर साइड में इसलिए नहीं दिखा रही क्योंकि हम यहां पर साइटमैप्स अमेठी नहीं किया है तो अगर हम साइट मैप
46:42
यहां पर सबमिट नहीं करेंगे तो कवरेज में साइटमैप से जो यह वायरल डिस्कवर वह दिखाए
46:48
गए ने इसका मतलब एक और क्वेश्चन का आंसर मिल गया कि यह जरूरी नहीं है कि साइटमैप्स
46:54
और 10 सोर्स आफ इंडक्शन इस बात को समझो बहुत से लोगों की साइड इफेक्ट नहीं लगाएंगे हम तुम्हारी वेबसाइट इंडेक्स ही
47:01
नहीं होगी अबे हमारे इंडक्शन होंगे ऐसा बिल्कुल नहीं है वह यहां से जस्टिफाई भी होती यहां पर तो साइटमैप नहीं है ना
47:07
साइटमैप नहीं है फिर भी आप देखो कितने पेजेस है वह लीड दिखा रहा है यहां पर अगर आप देखोगे तो साइटमैप है और साईट मैप यहां
47:14
पर सबमिट भी है और यहां पर अगर आप आओ वापस तो आप देखोगे कि साइटमैप में कितने पेजेस
47:19
मूवी आपको यहां पर दिख रहा है फाइल देख चीज तो आपको यह क्लियर हो गई उसके बाद आपको यहां पर आओगे तो जैसे जो भी आपके पेज
47:25
7 मिनट छोड़ कर लो कि आपके जहां पर ज्यादा दिख रहा है यह कम दिखना आपके साइड में कितने पेजेस क्योंकि कई बार ऐसा होता है
47:31
कि वेबसाइट में बहुत सारे url पर जाकर स्पेशली हीरो मत वेबसाइट में या अगर आपकी
47:37
वेबसाइट गड़बड़ हो गई थोड़े से जो है मालवीय अगर आपकी वेबसाइट के अंदर आ गए हैं जिसको आप वायरस वगैरह भूल सकते हो अगर वह
47:44
कुछ गड़बड़ी है तभी आप देखोगे यहां पर बहुत सारे आपको गड़बड़ गड़बड़ से यूअर गर्ल्स है वह दिखने लगेंगे इस मछली ऐसा तब
47:51
होता है जब ही बरस की वेबसाइट होती है तो मैं यह चीज आपको ही पर क्लियर कर देता हूं ताकि आपको भविष्य में कोई प्रॉब्लम बात ना
47:56
हो पाए तो यहां पर अगर आप देखोगे मैं इस पर्टिकुलर वेब लेकर चलेंगे यहां पर भी जिसका मैं आपको चीजें ज्यादा आसानी से समझ
48:03
में आ जाइए अगर मैं ऑल नोन पेजेस ऊपर जाता हूं तो आप सबसे पहले आप देखोगे आपको हेयर्स वाला सेक्शन दिखेगा और नीचे आओगे
48:09
तो यहां पर आपको रिपोर्ट भी दिखेगी कि पैरंट्स अगर आए हुए तो क्या हेयर है वह और
48:15
किस URL में वह यौवन क्योंकि जितना भी सी होता है ना आप मान कर चलो यह बहुत आप
48:20
बिल्कुल समझ लो कि जितना भी सी होता है वह पेज वास होता है तो कुछ भी आप स्टडी करते
48:25
हो कोई भी रिपोर्ट बनाते हो कोई विवाह प्रिंस बनाते हो कोई भी ऑन पंच करते हो सब कुछ आप एज वाइज ही करते हो तो अगर आप एक
48:33
चीज हमेशा ध्यान रखोगे ना कि एसडीओपी ज्वाइन होता तो आपको कभी कमजोर होने की जरूरत नहीं पड़ेगी तो यहां पर जो आपको ऐड
48:39
तभी दिखेंगे ना तो यहां पर हमें बता रहा है भी कोई भी इशू नहीं और आपको मेक शेयर करना है कि यह चीज हमेशा जीरो रहा है ठीक
48:46
है एरर्स नहीं आने चाहिए तो अगर वह रहा है यहां पर आपको पता चलेगा कौन सा ईयर है उसका टाइप है वस्तु पर क्लिक करेंगे तो आप
48:53
यह भी देखेंगे कि वह जो लेयर आ रहा है वह किन पेजेस में आ रहा है और उसके साथ-साथ आपको परेशान से मिल जाएंगे इस तरीके से आप
48:59
उसको रिमूव अच्छा तो पॉइंट तो आपको मिक्स और करना याद रखना है उसके बाद यहां पर वैलिड विद वार्निंग हमें दिखता है सीधा सा
49:06
मतलब है कि हमारा जो पेज है जो भी यहां पर दिखेगा कि हमारे जो पेज है वह पायलट तो है
49:13
बट कुछ स्पेसिफिक वार्निंग के साथ तो आप उन वॉर्मिंग के ऊपर काम कर लेंगे तो फिर आपको यहां पर जो है वह पेज पर पहले वाले
49:21
सेक्शन में जरा पूर्व और मिक्स को रिमूव करने के तो ठीक है बहुत ही बेसिक चीज़ें उसके बाद वेलवेट मगर मैं आता हूं तो आप
49:27
देख सकते हैं पर 11:00 जो है वह बैलेंस में दिखा रहा है बे सबमिटेड एंड इंडेक्स
49:32
ठीक है 10:00 ऐसे हैं जो सबमिटेड है और इंडेक्स है और एक पेज ऐसा है जो इंडेक्स
49:38
टू है बट साइटमैप में नहीं समेटा इसलिए सेमेस्टर में नहीं दिखा रहा था को सबमिट
49:43
का मतलब होता है हम अपनी तरफ से जब URL गूगल सर्च कंसोल के अंदर देते हैं जो डाट कम्स अंडर वक्त सबमिटेड थी कि मैंने खुद
49:50
दिया तब देने का तरीका क्या हो सकता है साइटमैप के संयोजकत्व में साइटमैप अपलोड
49:55
कर दूंगा हमने सबमिट किया यूआरएल ठीक है Google कहीं से ढूंढ लेता है गूगल ढूंढ लेता मेरे कई यूआरएल को इसका मतलब ये हुआ
50:03
कि अगर रोल करता फ्रेंड्स कर लेता है वह इंटैक्ट है बट यू नॉट सबमिटेड इन द साइटमैप तो यहां पर जो स्टेटस में दिख रहा
50:10
है वह यौवन का क्योंकि हम भी तो हो गया यूअर अब वह चाहे हमारे
50:16
साइटमैप्स के थ्रू सबमिट हुए हो चाहे वह हमारे डाइरैक्टली प्रॉब्लम ढूंढ लिए वह
50:22
मुद्दा मीटर हमारी वेबसाइट प्रॉपरली सबमिट हो चुके विराट की सारी चीजें वैलिड है अब
50:27
इंपोर्टेंट चीज तो यहां पर आप देखोगे एक्सक्लूडेड एक्सक्लूडेड का मतलब इन
50:32
यूआरएल स्कोर इग्नोर कर दिया है Google अब यह पौन इंची से क्यों भाई क्यों इग्नोर कर
50:38
दिया अब इस बात को समझेंगे तो आपको सारी चीजें टीजर समझ में आ जाएगी देखो मैं एक्सप्लोडेड पर जाता हूं अब यह बता रहा है
50:44
अगर मैं इनको ऑफ कर दूं कि केवल मैं अभी आपको दिखाना चाहती हूं इस लीड वाली डाटा हम लोग नहीं चाहते हैं तो यह बोल रहा है
50:51
कि इस क्यूट है क्योंकि एक अल्टरनेट पेज मिला हुआ है विद प्रॉपर टर्नऑन निकल टाइल
50:57
मतलब दो पेजेस थे और दोनों आपके ऊपर सेम कांटेस्ट था ठीक है जिसमे से गूगल करता
51:03
दोनों के ऊपर सेम कॉन्टेंट हम दो पेजेस को क्यों इंडेक्स करें हम तो किसी एक पेज को इंडेक्स करेंगे क्योंकि वही ओरिजिनल और
51:10
मास्टर पीस है इसके बारे में तनाव निकल वाला जो लेक्चर हमारा सेव और डिटेल में बात करी थी इसलिए मैं कहूं कि चीज है अगर
51:16
डिटेल में समझ नहीं है ना तो फिर वीडियोस को प्रॉपरली थोड़ा सा फॉलो करते रहना तो और अच्छे तरीके से चीजें समझ में आ जाएगी
51:22
तो दो पेज है सेम क्वांटिटी के ऊपर है तो कंफ्यूजन हो गया इसमें ओरिजिनल कौन है तो जो भी ओरिजिनल पेज वह तो इंडेक्स होगा जो
51:29
दूसरा पर होगा जो ओरिजिनल नहीं है ठीक है वह वाला पेज इग्नोर हो जाएगा का यहां की
51:35
लैंग्वेज में वाला पेज स्लॉट हो जाएगा तो अगर मैं यहां पर जाता है अल्टरनेट पेज विथ प्रॉपर तो मैं इसके ऊपर जाता हूं अब देखिए
51:41
यहां पर तो मैं खुद ही समझ में आएगा इस पेस्ट को मैं ओपन करता हूं यहां पर URL बहुत ध्यान से देखना क्या लिखा है तुम्हें अबाउट
51:47
html5 में कुंवारे यहां पर दिख रहा है अबाउट डॉट एचटीएमएल ठीक है एक प्यार हो गया अगर मैं केवल अबाउट ओपन करता हूं तो
51:55
आप देखो यह भी तो सेमी है कॉन्टेंट तो ही मतलब दो अलग-अलग ओरल स्पेस सेम कॉन्टेंट आराम यहां पर मैं
52:03
अबाउट html5 कर लेता हूं आप देख लो यह भी छुआरे यह भी वायरल दो अलग-अलग URL के ऊपर सेम
52:09
क्वांटिटी द्वारा अब लोग हर एक चीज तो है यह तो स्लाइस बूट है यह सिलाई संभव है बट मैंने आपको बताया था कि अगर कुछ भी चेंज
52:16
वैसे डौ फेस्टिवल है यह गूगल स्काई डिफरेंट यू आर यू कंसीडर करता है इसको गूगल डुओ एक डिफरेंट वायरल कंसीडर करता है
52:23
बिल्कुल वैसे ही जैसे ट्रिपल डब्ल्यू वाले वर्जन को नोट पर डब्लू वाले वर चैंस को
52:28
दोनों को गूगल डिफरेंट यह क्रॉस का हो या पेजेस बहुत ज्यादा उसमें मैदा दो डिफरेंट
52:33
तेजस जो है वह कंसीडर करता तो अब आप बताओ मेरे को यहां पर एक पेज है दोपहर दोनों
52:39
पैरों पर कॉन्टेंट क्या है कांटेस्ट से मिला है अगर दोनों पीस इसके ऊपर कांटेस्ट से मिलर है तो यहां पर तो प्रॉब्लम क्रिएट
52:45
हो गए ना तो एक ही Play Store इंडेक्स होगा तो इसलिए यहां पर आप देख रहे हो कि इन्होंने बोला कि बहुत सारे ऐसे पेजेस थे
52:51
जिनमें यह इशू था ठीक है चौराहे बजे थे यह इशू था ठीक है तो वह वाले पेजेस को इग्नोर
52:58
कर दिया गया है तरीके से अगर आप यहां पर आते हो नॉट पॉइंट बहुत सारे ऐसे पेजेस है जो नॉट फाउंड भेजो
53:04
एग्जिट ही नहीं करते तो हमें इनको सॉल्व करना पड़ेगा प्रॉपर तरीके से डुप्लीकेट विदाउट यूजर्स सिलेक्टेड निकल अब यह पेजेस
53:13
डुप्लीकेट तो है बट इनका कोई कैनॉनिकल इनका कोई मास्टर परिचय नहीं बताया गया ठीक
53:18
है तो यह भी कह रहा है तो अगर हम इनको प्रॉपरली कैनॉनिकलाइज एक्शन इनका कर दें यह जो इशू है इसको इंस्टॉल कर दे तो यह
53:24
पेजेस विशाल हो जाएंगे ठीक है अगर आपको जिसमें सलूशन कर लेते तो इसे थोड़ा सा टाइम लगता है और फिर यह कवरेज वाली
53:32
रिपोर्ट के अंदर आपको जो भी आपने चेंजेस किए हुए अगर वह ठीक तरीके से ठीक है तो वह आपको यहां पर सेलेक्ट हो जाते हैं तो जैसे
53:38
यहां पर देखोगे लास्ट अपडेटेड जो है वह 38 को है मतलब आठ मार्च को यह लास्ट जो
53:44
अपडेटेड रिपोर्ट है थोड़ा टाइम लगता है आज की डेट है वह 11th मार्च है तो तीन दिन
53:50
पहले का यह तो अगर आज आपको चेंज करते तो इसको यहां पर फर्क लेने में थोड़ा सा टाइम लग सकता है अभी आपको समझ में आएगी कह
53:58
रिपोर्ट के अंदर हमको क्या पता चल रहा है कि हमारे पेज बस कौन से इंटैक्ट हो रहा है नहीं हो रहा तो क्या प्रॉब्लम है कुछ भी
54:04
इसमें आरारोट क्या प्रॉब्लम है को इंपोर्टेंट है जैसा तो नहीं जो इंजेक्शन नहीं हो पा रहा है और क्या रिएक्शन उसके
54:09
विचार है यह सारी चीजें जो हमें कवरेज वाले सेक्शन के अंदर प्रभाव चलती है इसलिए मेरी कमेंट कर पाओगे सबसे पहले मैं पूरी
54:15
कवरेज की जो रिपोर्ट है ना उसको प्रॉपरली स्कैन कर लो और यहां से आप इस रिपोर्ट को अगर सपोर्ट करना चाहिए तो थैंक यू कैन ऑल
54:22
शोल्ड डूब गाइस गूगल सर्च कंसोल में अभी तक का जो हम
54:27
लोग डिस्कशन किया है उसमें हम लोग इस चीज को समझने की कोशिश करी है कि हमारी वेबसाइट को स्क्रोल कैसे किया जाता है
54:34
हमारी वेबसाइट को इंडेक्स कैसे किया जाता है और उससे related जो रिपोर्ट्स है वह गूगल सर्च कंसोल के अंदर हमें कहां पर
54:40
दिखाई देती है जो कवरेज वाला सेक्शन हम लोगों ने डिस्कस किया था वह इसी चीज से रिलेटिड है कि आपके जो वेब पेजेस है वह
54:47
कौन से पेज जो है वह इंडेक्स में उनमे क्या प्रॉब्लम से कहां पर वार्निंग सारी कौन सी वेलवेट है और कौन से वेलवेट नहीं
54:53
है पेजेस और किस टाइप केयर उसके अंदर है यह सारी चीजें हम लोगों ने कवरेज वाले रिपोर्ट के अंदर लिखी थी गाइस अभी तक भी
55:00
मैं परफॉर्मेंस वाली रिपोर्ट पर नहीं पहुंचा हूं कहने का मतलब कि हमारे वेब पेजेस किस तरीके से सर्च इंजन रिजल्ट
55:06
पेजेस के अंदर परफॉर्म कर रहे हैं इसके ऊपर अभी तक नहीं पहुंचेगी क्योंकि सबसे पहले हमें यही मैच्योर करना है कि हमारे
55:12
जो ऐप है जिसमें प्रॉपरली रोल हुए भी हैं या नहीं कोई अर्थ तो नहीं है और कैरल हो गए प्रॉपरली हुए इंडेक्स हुए हैं या नहीं
55:18
हुए हैं और इंडेक्सिंग में भी को उनको हेयर तो नहीं आ रहा तो यह सारी जो चीज है ना यह सारी चीजें हम लोग पहले इंच और
55:25
करेंगे उसके बाद हम लोग परफॉर्मेंस और बाकी चीजों के ऊपर जाता है Google सर्च कंसोल के अंदर तो अगर मैं बात करूं कि
55:31
युवा रन इंस्पेक्शन टूल करके क्या हमें देगा तो इसको मैंने चार पार्ट्स में डिवाइड किया हुआ है सबसे पहला जो व की
55:38
वायरल इंफेक्शन टूल करता है वह करंट इंडेक्सिंग स्टेटस यानी कि हमारा जो पेज
55:44
है वह अभी इंडेक्स हुआ है या नहीं हुआ है तो मतलब उसका इंडक्शन से रिलेटेड स्टेटस
55:49
वह में पता चला है सेकंड्स टेस्टिंग अलाइव यूआरएल जो अभी हमारी वेबसाइट पर लाइव URL है हम्म उसको अगर टेस्ट करना चाहिए अभी जो
55:56
हमारा URL है वह किस तरीके से दिख रहा है तभी ऑप्शन में हुआ है क्वेश्चन टूल में मिलता है और इस नाम से आपको पता चला है
56:02
वायरल इन्फेक्शन का मतलब होता है कि हमारा जो webpage है उसको पूरी तरीके से इंस्पेक्ट करना है थर्ड जो है वह देख सकते
56:10
हो रिक्वेस्टिंग टो क्रॉल ऑफिस लेट से आपकी वेबसाइट को पेज छाप वह पहले से इंटैक्ट आपने सुरेश चंद्र बोस सारे चेंजेस
56:16
कर दी तो आप चाहते हो कि तुरंत आप एक और जो इंडक्शन है वह रिक्वेस्ट करें तो वह
56:22
चीज अगर आपको कर रही है तो आपको यह वायरल इंफेक्शन टू मीट लेनी पड़ेगी 4G अपॉइंटेड एस अश्लील इंफॉर्मेशन अबाउट पेज लोड
56:28
रिसोर्सेस देखो अमित पेज लोड होता है ना तो उसके साथ उसकी जावास्क्रिप्ट इसका एस्टीमेट यह सारी चीजें भी लोग होती है तो
56:35
इससे रिलेटिड कोई अर्थ तो नहीं इससे रिलेटिड कोई प्रॉब्लम तो नहीं यह सारी चीजें भी हमें यूअर अलेक्शन टूर के रुखसती
56:40
इवन अगर हमारे पेट के ऊपर कोई स्कीम आफ डाटा है तो उसमें कोई प्रॉब्लम है इसमें तो कोई अर्थ नहीं है वह सारी चीजें हमारा
56:47
जो पिज़्ज़ा मोबाइल फ्रेंडली है यह सारी चीजें थ्रो यूअर इंफेक्शन टू जगह पता चल
56:53
जाती हैं तो परफॉर्मेंस की रिपोर्ट से पहले हमें यह सारी चीजें भी समझने की जरूरत है मैं आ चुका हूं एक डेमो वेबसाइट
56:59
के कल सुबह जहां पर जैसे कि आप देख सकते इंस्पेक्टर निवारण लिखा हुआ यहां पर क्लिक करता हूं और मैं अपने एक URL को यहां पर
57:06
जो है वो एंटर करता हूं ताकि यह गूगल के इंडेक्स डाटा जो है वह उठा सकें अब वायरल
57:11
को इंस्पेक्टर करने के अलग-अलग तरीके हो सकते हैं आप यहां से कर सकते हो यह वायरल इंफेक्शन यहां पर यह जाओगे तभी आप कर सकते
57:18
हो और अगर आपको रिपोर्ट देख रहा हूं जैसे मैं यहां पर कवरेज रिपोर्ट ओपन कर देता हूं अगर आपको रिपोर्ट देख रहे हो और कहीं
57:24
पर भी अगर आपको URL ठीक है जैसे यह तो यहां पर आपको एक छोटा सा सर्च का आइकॉन दिख रहा है यहां पर भी आप क्लिक करके ही
57:31
वायरल इंफेक्शन पर जा सके अब आप यहां पर देखो यूआरएलएस वैज्ञानिक इंटैक्ट हो चुका
57:36
है फाइंड अगर आपको दोबारा इंडेक्सिंग रिक्वेस्ट करनी तो आप यहां से कर सकते हो जो आपका कॉर्ड पर यह आपको वह देख है तो आप
57:42
यहां से देख सकते हो अगर आपको लाइव टेस्टिंग करनी है तो वह आप यहां पर कर सकते अभी मैं करूंगा इस चीज को कवरेज के
57:48
अंदर हम लोग आएंगे तीन सेक्शन में एक्चुअली डिवाइड होता है जब आप कमरे के अंदर आओगे तो आप देखोगे आपका URL किस
57:54
तरीके से डिस्कवर हुआ था तो यहां पर साइटमैप्स की हेल्प से ही वायरल डिस्कवर हुआ था कोई रैफरिंग पेज पिंपल्स मतलब क्या
58:01
यार अलगिरी दूसरी वायरल के ऊपर लिंक मेंशन है तो वह नहीं है कोई भी डिटेक्टर नहीं बट
58:07
लास्ट रोल कब यह हुआ था और कैरल जब हुआ था तो किस डिवाइस में इसको कॉल किया था तो
58:13
गूगल का जो Google बहुत है स्मार्टफोन वाला गूगल व्हाट उसने इसको कि रोल किया था कॉलिंग बेल्ट है यह स्पंज हो रहा है
58:19
प्रॉपरली है सक्सेसफुल है इंडेक्सिंग बेल्ट है यस यूजर डिक्लेयर्ड कैनॉनिकल जो है इसका वह क्या है मतलब यह सिर्फ
58:26
कैनॉनिकलाइज रिएक्शन पर है तो कैनॉनिकलाइज एक्शन वाला वीडियो अगर आप देखोगे तो आपको समझ में आ जाएगा कि यूज डिक्लेयर्ड निकल
58:33
मैं यहां पर जो है हमारा यही हमारा होम पेज भी है और इसका जो कैनॉनिकल यूअर है वह है ठीक है Google सेलेक्टेड युवा करना
58:40
निकाल जो है वह इंस्पेक्टर दुआ रहेगी और उसके बाद इनहांसमेंट में आपको जिसकी में डाटा वगैरह उससे लेटर आपको रिपोर्ट नहीं
58:46
जाती है जल्दी अगर आप देखोगे हैं आप स्कीम एडिटर की एक रिपोर्ट लोगों के फॉर्म में आपको यहां पर दिख रही है ठीक है और उसके
58:53
बाद अगर हम लोग यहां पर देखें तो मोबाइल यूज क्वालिटी में पेजेस मोबाइल फ्रेंडली है मेरी प्रोफाइल यहां पर तो आपको क्लियर
58:59
नहीं दिख रहा है अपने पर ललीना यहां पर एक और प्रॉपर्टी जो है वह ओपन करके यहां पर कुछ एयर था जिसे आप देखिए यहां पर यह
59:06
वायरल जॉन गूगल बट इट्स इश्यूज टो इश्यूज क्या है अगर मैं कमरे सेक्शन में जाता हूं
59:11
तो आप देखोगे यह URL जो है ना वह इंडेक्स तो है बट यह सबमिट नहीं साइटमैप में ठीक
59:16
है ओके फाइंड तो यहां पर अगर आप देखोगे साइटमैप में भी नहीं दिखेगा आपको नॉट एप्लीकेबल क्योंकि सबमिट नहीं है रैफरिंग
59:23
पेज भी नहीं डिटेक्ट हुआ है लास्ट क्रॉलिंग इसकी कब हुई थी और बाकी सारी आपको जो रिपोर्ट्स वह दिख रही मोबाइल
59:29
रिलेटिव और क्योंकि यह वर्ष के वह कमर से बनी हुई वेबसाइट है तो प्रोडक्ट रिलेटिड इसमें कुछ इशूज है ठीक है कोई आप देख सकते
59:37
हैं यहां पर कोई ऐसा प्रोडक्ट की आइटम है जिसमें इसकी यू रिव्यूज एग्रीगेटेड रेटिंग बहुत सारी चीजें जो है ना वह मीटिंग है तो
59:43
यह सारे फीचर्स जो भी है वह आपको यहां पर पता चलते हैं जो भी इंपोर्टेंट होते हैं कि वायरल से रिलेटेड उसकी आंखों रॉलिंग और
59:51
इंडेक्सिंग से रिलेटिड वह भी आपको यहां पर पता चलते हैं राइट तो दोनों चीज आपने देखी कि अगर हमारा URL परफेक्ट है ठीक है तो वह
1:00:00
अपने मित्र दिखाई देगा अगर वह परफेक्ट नहीं है तो उसमें अगर एड्रेस वगैरा तो किस तरीके से दिखाई देगा इस समय बताया कि अगर
1:00:05
आपको दोबारा इंडक्शन रिक्वेस्ट करना है आप यहां से कर सकते हो कि आपका जो कॉर्ड Page अगर आपको वह देखना है तो आपको यहां से
1:00:11
क्षण बताया था कि पेज की जो दूसरी रिसोर्सेस है वह जो लोग होते वह मैं यहां पर दिख रही है इसलिए मेल वगैरह और अगर
1:00:17
हमें टेस्ट करना है लाइव URL तो आप टेस्ट लाइव वालपेपर करोगे तो यह कुछ टाइम लेगा
1:00:23
डिपेंडिंग ऑन कि कितना बड़ा आपका पेज है कितनी रिसोर्सेज है उस पर इसके ऊपर उसके बेसिस पर यह टेस्टिंग कर रहा है ठीक है
1:00:29
थोड़ा सा टाइम ले है उसके बाद आपको यहां पर रिजल्ट्स जो कर देगा तो गाइस अभी आप देख सकते है हमने लाइव टेस्ट किया मतलब कि
1:00:35
अभी गूगल सर्च कंसोल किस टाइप से हमारे URL की रिपोर्ट है वह जनरेटर है यहां गूगल
1:00:41
इंडेक्ड आपको यहां पर दिख रहा है ठीक है यह तो गूगल का इंडिक है मतलब गूगल के सर्वर में जो इन्फॉर्मेशन तो उस हिसाब से
1:00:46
बता रहा है बट अगर मैं अभी कोई क्लाइव टेक्स्ट करता हूं तो फिर क्या रिपोर्ट निकलकर आती है वह आपको यहां पर देखिए तो
1:00:52
अभी आपको चीजे समझ में आ गई होगी कि वायरल इंफेक्शन का वक्त होता है अगर आप जो है
1:00:57
कोई स्क्रीनशॉट लेना चाहते हैं तो आप यहां से स्त्री अपने समय लगा आपको पता चल जाए कि वायरल इंफेक्शन का वर्क क्या होता है
1:01:05
बहुत ही डिटेल में हम लोग समझने वाले हैं कि परफॉर्मेंस रिपोर्ट के अंदर हमें क्या-क्या इनसाइड सरकार के डाटा के
1:01:11
इंफोर्मेशन हमें देखने को मिलती है वह सबसे पहले हम लोग यह समझ में कुछ करते हैं कि आखिर परफॉर्मेंस का यहां पर मतलब क्या
1:01:17
है अगर हमारे पास कोई हमारी वेबसाइट है उसके अंदर बहुत सारे वेब पेजेस हैप्पीनेस है टाइट तो वह पेजेस हमारे किस तरीके से
1:01:24
सर्च इंजन रिजल्ट पेज के ऊपर परफॉर्म कर रहे हैं उसकी इन्फॉर्मेशन में परफॉर्मेंस रिपोर्ट के अंदर मिलती है कहने का मतलब
1:01:30
सीधा सा यह है कि मान लेते हैं यहां से आ जाता हूं गूगल के ऊपर और गूगल के ऊपर लेट
1:01:35
से मैं टाइप करता हूं यहां पर इंडिया राइट मैं यहां पर इंडिया टाइप करता हूं और आप देख रहे हैं यहां पर बहुत सारी हमें जो
1:01:42
वेबसाइट होंगे पेजेस है वह में दिखाई दे रहे हैं लेट से हमें यह पेज यहां पर दिख रहा है रिजर्व बैंक ऑफ इंडिया तो अगर
1:01:49
रिज़र्व बैंक ऑफ इंडिया के गूगल सर्च कंसोल के अंदर हम लोग जाकर परफॉर्मेंस में चक्कर में कोशिश करेंगे हमें पता चलेगा कि
1:01:55
हमारा यह वाला जो पेज है आरबीआई डॉट ओआरजी डॉट इन यह वाला हम आप मैं इस पर्टिकुलर
1:02:00
परी के ऊपर इंडिया में जो है वह रेडी कर रहा है और उसको इतनी कलेक्शन इतने
1:02:06
इंप्रेशंस मिले राइड तो हमारा अगर कोई पेज है वह किस तरीके से सचिन पायलट प्रोजेक्ट
1:02:11
में परफॉर्म कर रहा है अगर इसको हमें समझ जाएं तो आप देख सकते हो यहां पर हमारे पास यह परफॉरमेंस की रिपोर्ट होती अब एक और
1:02:17
चीज यहां पर बहुत डिटेल में हम लोग समझेंगे कि जब हम लोग बात करते हैं किसी रिपोर्ट की तो आप समझे इसका परपस क्या है
1:02:23
मैं देखता हूं बहुत सारे लोग क्या करते हैं यहां पर हमको पता सारी चीजें यहां पर जो है वह क्लिक मेंशन इंप्रैशन मेनशंस है
1:02:29
सीसीआर मेंशन है अब रिपोजिशन मेंशन है वह यहां पर आपने यह सारी चीजें देखते हैं देखने के बाद बस देख लेते हैं यहां मेरा
1:02:36
CR बड़ा यह स्थिति हर घट रहा है या एवरेस्ट पोजीशन में भी बढ़ रही है घटरी क्या हो रहा है और उसके बाद वह उससे कोई
1:02:41
कंफ्यूजन ही निकालते हैं देखो जब हम बात करते हैं रिपोर्ट्स की रिपोर्ट्स का सीधा सा मतलब होता है कि आपको किसी डाटा के
1:02:48
बेसिस पर एक रिपोर्ट मिली है वो उसकी आपने एनालिसिस क्या करें और एनालिसिस करने के
1:02:54
बाद उस अनालिसिस के बेसिस पर जो आपको डिशंस लेने हैं जो आपको चेंजेस लेने हैं वह आप अपने ठीक हो सकता है कि कोई चेंजेस
1:03:02
लेने की जरूरत ना हो बट आप एग्री हो ना पड़े का यह हमारी रिपोर्ट इस तरीके की है कि सब कुछ ठीक चल रहा है अभी कोई चेंजेस
1:03:07
करने की जरूरत नहीं है बट अगर चेंजेस करने की जरूरत है तो क्या आप यह चीज जस्टिफाई
1:03:13
कर पाते हैं या डाटा से समझ पाते हैं कि हमें किस टाइप के चेंजेस है वह करने की जरूरत है तो इन सारी चीजों के ब्याह थोड़ा
1:03:20
सा लोग डिस्कशन करेंगे रिपोर्ट में और बहुत इंपोर्टेंट चीज होती लड्डू चोरी डाट की जो हम रिपोर्ट देख रहा है वह किस टाइम
1:03:26
पीरियड की रिपोर्ट हम लोग देख रहें फाइट तो वह अगर हम लोग यहां पर इस रिपोर्ट के ऊपर आया और इसके एक जो एलिमेंट्स आफ हिस
1:03:33
रिपोर्ट चैप्टर उनको सपोर्ट करने कोशिश करें देखते हैं क्या चीज हमें गूगल सर्च कंसोल के परफॉर्मेंस वाले सेक्शन के अंदर
1:03:39
मिलती है तो वे यहां पर सबसे पहले आपको सर्च टाइप हम यहां पर दिख रहा है अब मतलब
1:03:44
जब कोई यूजर गूगल के ऊपर जाता है यहां पर जैसा है मैंने यहां पर टाइप किया इंडिया
1:03:49
राइट तो अगर कोई भी उतर इस टाइप से टाइप करते हुए बहुत सारी इजी करेंगे इसमें एग्जांपल यह मान लेते हैं कि हमारी
1:03:55
वेबसाइट थी पॉइंट तो यहां पर अगर हमारी वेबसाइट शो करती है तो देख स्कूल ड्रेस
1:04:00
वेब जैसे यहां पर आप देख रहें हैं कि हम सचिन रिजल्ट पेज के इस ऑल वाले सेक्शन में वाले सेक्शन में क्या परफॉर्म करना है या
1:04:07
नहीं कर रहे है प्राइड हम इमेजेस वाले सेक्शन में क्या परफॉर्म कर रहे हैं या नहीं करें जैसे कि हम यहां पर बात करें तो
1:04:13
आप देख सकते हैं पर मैं आफ इंडिया तो मैप्स ऑफ़ इंडिया वेबसाइट जो है यह वाला
1:04:18
जो पेज है वह यह जो गूगल का सर्च इंजन पर है उसके इमेजेस वाले सेक्शन में परफॉर्म
1:04:24
कर रहा है तो अगर हमें यह समझना है कि जैसे मैं यहां पर आ जाता है परफॉरमेंस के ऊपर कि हमें जो एनालेसिस लेनी है वह कौन
1:04:31
से सर्च टाइप प्रेम एनालिसिस लेनी है वह सर्च टाइप वेब है वह सब्सक्राइब इमेजेस है
1:04:36
वह सब्सक्राइब वीडियोस है या न्यूज़ है मतलब हम यह समझना चाहते हैं कि हम वेब में कैसा परफॉर्म कर रहे हैं सचिन पायलट पर
1:04:44
इसके ऊपर हम न्यूज़ में इमेजेस में वीडियोस में किस तरीके से परफॉर्म कर रहे हैं तो वह में समझना है तो फिर हम यहां से
1:04:50
फादर जाकर जो है फिल्टर लगा सकते हैं जैसे एग्जांपल के तौर पर अगर मैं इमेजेस के ऊपर
1:04:56
चला जाता हूं तो इसका मतलब यह है कि अब इमेजेस वाले सेक्शन में है अयोग्य पेजेस है वेबसाइट है वह किस तरीके से परफॉर्म कर
1:05:02
रही है फाइट यहां पर में वापस आ जाता हूं परफॉरमेंस के ऊपर तो अगर आप इमेजेस वाले सेक्शन को पर जाओगे तो इमेजेस वाले सेक्शन
1:05:08
में लास्ट थ्री मंथ्स में हमारी यह जो डेमो वेबसाइट है इसको लगभग लगभग 1200 केयर
1:05:14
आउट जो है वह यहां पर इंप्रैशन जो है वह मिले हुए हम यहां पर कोई फिक्स नहीं मिले हो सकता है कुछ करेगी इसके ऊपर जो हमारी
1:05:21
इमेजेस के इंप्रेशन ज़ोर है वह काफी नीचे हो रहा हूं तो इंप्रेशन तो के रस मैं यहां पर बात करता हूं तो अगर कोई बंदा कुछ सर्च
1:05:28
कर रहा है तो अगर वह स्क्रोल करते थे यहां पर जैसे यह वाला जो इमेज है वह लोग होती है तो मान कर चलिए यहां पर उसका इंप्रेशन
1:05:34
हो गया और इसी तरीके से हो सकता है कि यहां पर हमें जो इंप्रेशन है वह बहुत सारे
1:05:39
इंप्रेशंस मिले फट हो सकता है हमारी इमेज की जो पोजीशन है वहीं की है वह इतनी अच्छी नहीं थी यह हमारी वह इमेज है उतनी अच्छी
1:05:46
नहीं थी कि उसमें बहुत ज्यादा क्लिक जो है ना वह नहीं अचीव किए उसे पर यहां पर
1:05:52
इंप्रेशंस को मिल गए भटकुंइयां फाइंड ए प्रेस सीटियां ही सीटियां इस इलेक्ट्रोलाइट अब अगर क्लिक ही नहीं है तो
1:05:58
क्लिक करें डेट कैसे होगा है और जो मैं एवरेज पोजीशन की बात करा आप यहां पर आप देख सकते हो एवरेस्ट पोजीशन कितनी सिक्सटी
1:06:04
तो काफी नीचे एवरेज पोजीशन आ रही है तो एवरेस्ट पोजीशन अगर 60k तो चांसेस कम है
1:06:09
कि हमें बहुत अच्छा वहां पर सीटीआर मिलेगा यह बहुत अच्छे रिलेवेंट हमें क्लिक जो मिले हुए कमिंग बैक टू द इंपोर्टेंट पार्ट
1:06:17
जो कि हमारा व्यवहार ही पार्ट होता अगर मैं वापस वह वाले पार्टियों पर आ जाऊं तो आप देख सकते हो इसमें हमें जो टोटल क्लिक
1:06:23
शामिल हैं वह फिक्स टोटल क्लिक मिले लास्ट 3 उसमें अगर मैं सिक्वेंस देखना चाहूं तो
1:06:29
यह देखना चाह डेड टोटल यह टूल्स कि हम कितना टाइम फ्रेम लेना चाहते हैं रिपोर्ट्स के घर में बात करो तो थोड़ा सा
1:06:35
अगर आप ज्यादा टाइम फ्रेम ले रहे हो तो ही अच्छा होता है मान लेते हैं कि आपकी वेबसाइट पर ट्रैफिक बहुत ज्यादा आता है
1:06:40
आपको जोन सचिन रिजल्ट में विजिबिलिटी बहुत मिलती है पर इंप्रेशन बहुत मिलता है वहां
1:06:45
पर आप छोटा टाइम पीरियड मिलेगा तो हलवा आपको हजारों इंप्रेशन रोज मिलना है 5000 6000 10,000 इंप्रेशन रोज मिला है तो ऐसे
1:06:53
में अगर आप एक सप्ताह की एक विकिडाटा अगर आप देखेंगे तो वह भी मोर देन अपडेट होगी
1:06:59
क्योंकि यह वीडियो अगर आपको साधारण इंप्रेशन रोज मिल रहा है तो सात दिन में अच्छे से इंप्रेशन मिले अच्छे से क्लिक भी
1:07:05
आपको मिल रहे होंगे तो फिर वहां पर आप सात दिन 10 दिन या 15 दिन या एक महीने की जो रिपोर्ट है वह देख सकते हैं पर ज्यादातर
1:07:12
केस में लोग थोड़े से लॉग व पीरियड आफ टाइम की जो रिपोर्ट है वह देखना प्रेफर करते हैं जाकर उस आफ डाटा नहीं आ रही है
1:07:19
तो ठीक है बट अगर मैं आपको यही रिक्वेस्ट करूंगा कि आप चीजों का टेस्ट करके देखें 710 की रिपोर्ट देखें जाकर ट्रीटेड एस की
1:07:26
रिपोर्ट जाकर देखें और उससे कुछ कन्फ्यूशंस निकालने की कोशिश करें उसके बाद एक और फीचर जो मुझे पर्सनली बहुत पसंद
1:07:32
है डिश अच्छी तो कंपेयर फीचर राइट तो हमने यहां पर कंपेयर लास्ट थ्री मंथ्स टू द प्रीवियस पीरियड्स जैसे अभी के 3 महीने और
1:07:39
उससे पहले के तीन महीने के बीच में घर में कंपटीशन करना चाहूंगा मुझे बताया कि मैंने पिछले तीन मैंने बहुत सॉफ्ट की हैं तो
1:07:46
क्या उन्हें वर्ष का कुछ रिजल्ट मुझे देखने को मिला कि हम राइटिंग इंप्रूव करने की कोशिश कर रहे थे तो क्या हमारे वेब
1:07:52
पेजेस की लाइन इंप्रूव हुई क्या हमें जाना इंप्रेशन देखने को मिले तो इन सारी चीजों को compare करने के लिए अगर हम चाहते हैं
1:08:00
पॉइंट के बेसिस पर कंपेयर करना तो यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं से कंपेयर लास्ट फ्री मंटू प्रीवियस पिडावा इसको सेलेक्ट करके
1:08:06
हमें यहां पर सिंपली अप्लाई कर देंगे तो अब देखिए कि आपको दो चीजें यहां पर दिखाइए फाइनल तो अगर आप यहां पर देखो तो टोटल के
1:08:12
कितने फॉरेसिक्स लास्ट थ्री मंथ्स में और उससे पहले प्रोफाइलिंग साइड है नाइट तो
1:08:18
क्योंकि इसमें बताइए डमी वेबसाइट हम बहुत सारा काम नहीं करें इसके ऊपर बस यह एजुकेशन परपस है यहां पर टाइप 255 से यहां
1:08:24
पर टोटल सिक्स अगर आप देखो तो फटी 6 थोड़ा सा डाउन हुए यहां पर नंबर ऑफ क्लिक असली
1:08:29
इंप्रेशन देखो इनक्रीज है वन नंबर फिक्स हमारे डाउन हुए जिससे कि हमारे जो सीसीआर है वह भी डाल हुआ और जो हमारी एवरेज
1:08:36
पोजीशन वह भी डोंट मतलब हम पहले अगर हमारी एवरेज पोजीशन 1730 तो अब हमारी जो एवरेस्ट
1:08:42
पोजीशन है व हो गई है कि अब रेस्टोरेशन यहां पर मतलब हमें बहुत सारे लोग जाना वह वर्स्ट पोजीशन में कनफ्यूज हो जाते समय
1:08:48
वर्स्ट पोजीशन का मतलब है वह इरेक्शन का मतलब होता है कि माल्या एक कोरी के ऊपर
1:08:53
ठीक है इसको इस तरीके से हम लोग समय में कुछ करते हैं यहां पर आपको समझाता हूं आपको ज्यादा क्लियर होगा मान लेते यहां पर
1:08:58
डिफरेंट डिफरेंट को यह अजय और एक वैरी के ऊपर हमारा यह वाला एक पेज जो है पेज 150
1:09:04
फीत पोजीशन पर लाइक करता है दूसरी ओर के ऊपर जो हमारा पेस्ट टू है यह सिक्स पोजीशन पर रन करता है तीसरी क्वेरी के ऊपर हमारा
1:09:12
जो पेट स्थिर है वहीं करता है हमारा लेट से यहां पर मैं मान लेता हूं आप 65 11 हो
1:09:18
गया तो यहां पर चार-चार पोजिशन इन थे राइट तो अगर मैं बात करूं यह वाला प्लीज माफ पोजीशन पर आईं कर रहा है यह वाला पेज
1:09:25
मासिक पोजीशन पर यह वाला प्लीज हमारा पॉजिशन पर ऑन कर रहा है तो करो पूछो और एवरेज मेरी फ्रेंड की कितनी थी एवरेज का
1:09:32
जो बेसिक्स आफ मैथमेटिक्स फार्मूला होता को आप लगा लोगे 410 515 डिवाइडेड बाय 3
1:09:37
डिजिट 125 तो मैं बोलूंगा एवरेज पोजीशन जो है हमारी वेबसाइट की क्योंकि यह वाला जो
1:09:43
मेरा पेट है वह शिफ्ट पोजीशन पर एंकर यह वाला जो मारा पेज है यह सिर्फ पोजीशन पर आकर यह जो अ है वह पोजीशन प्रैंक कर रहा
1:09:49
है तो हमने एक तरीके से इनका एवरेस्ट निकालिए और हम बोलेंगे हमारी वेबसाइट की जो एवरेज पोजीशन है ना वह है हमारी फेवरेट
1:09:56
एवरेस्ट क्वेश्चन फाइल वैसे यहां पर अगर मान लेते कि यह फाइव हो कि जैसे तो यह पॉइंट में चली जाती 510 और सिक्सटीन
1:10:03
डिवाइडेड बाय यहां तीन हो जाता तो यह लगभग 5.3 के अराउंड हमारी एवरेज पोजीशन यहां पर
1:10:10
आती फाइन तो इसलिए आप देख रहे हैं यहां पर आपको कुछ एवरेस्ट पोजीशन इस तरीके से दिख रही कि हमारी जो एवरेस्ट पोजीशन थी पिछले
1:10:16
से पिछले वाले 3 महीने में वह 17.8 एवरेज पोजीशन थी मीणा और अब हमारी एवरी पोजीशन
1:10:22
है वह 21.1 है लास्ट थ्री मंथ के अगर हम एवरेज कुंठा निकालने कोशिश करें तो भरी अमृत पोजीशन 21.1 है अब एक बहुत
1:10:30
इंपोर्टेंट चीज मैं यहां पर आपको क्लीयर करूंगा देखो एवरेज पोजीशन मुझे बहुत ही ज्यादा रिलेवेंट नहीं लगती है मैट्रिक्स
1:10:37
क्योंकि अगर मैं इसको बताऊं आपको तो आपको समझ में आएगा कि एवरेस्ट पोजीशन उतनी सालाना ऐप को रेट नहीं जैसे मानकर चलता
1:10:44
हूं कि मेरा ब्रांड नेम है उम्र तस्वीर अब इस बात को समझेगा मेरा ब्रांड ने मृतक की
1:10:50
रोड इसी नाम से मेरी वेबसाइट है अगर कोई Google पर जाता है और उम्र तस्की टाइप करता है तो दहाई चांस कि मेरी वेबसाइट
1:10:57
पहली पोजीशन प्रैंक हो जाए अग्रि यह वही पर अगर कोई यह टाइप करता है डिजिटल
1:11:03
मार्केटिंग ट्रेनर मान लिया है डिजिटल मार्केटिंग एजेंसी वहां पर मैं रंग कर रहा
1:11:08
हूं टेंथ पोजिशन पर अगर मैं दोनों का एवरेज निकालूं कितना आएगा 11:00 डिवाइडेड
1:11:13
बाय टू यानि 5.5 तो Google सर्च कंसोल हमें बताएगा कि आपकी जो वेबसाइट की अभी की
1:11:19
रैंकिंग है वह f5 तो आपको लगेगा रिपोजिशन ट्राई करूं पटना को आफ पॉजिशन पर ऑन कर
1:11:25
रहा हूं देखोगे अगर आप जाकर तो आप कुछ को इसके ऊपर पहली पोजीशन धारण करक हेयर इसके
1:11:30
ऊपर टेंथ पोजिशन के ऊपर ऑन करो तो बात समझ में आई हमें कि एवरेज वाली जो रिपोर्ट है
1:11:36
ना वह इतनी एक्यूरेट नहीं होती है ठीक है एक एग्जांपल्स मैं आपको बताओ ए ग्रेट मतलब
1:11:41
यहां पर एक्टिवेट तो है वह अगर देखा जाए तो कैलकुलेशन डेकोरेट है और हमारे काम क्योंकि नहीं होती है इसको ऐसे समस्त हम
1:11:47
लोग एक और मैं यहां पर देता हूं आप मुकाबला इंट्रस्टिंग जानते है लेट से एक स्टूडेंट के एग्जाम में नंबर आते हैं 60%
1:11:55
मार्क्स आप बोलोगे ठीक है इसके फर्स्ट डिवीज़न मार्क्स आगे इसको 60% पास मिले ठीक है क्वेश्चन मार्क ठीक है हम उसे और
1:12:03
ज्यादा पूछते हैं और गला डिस्कशन खत्म पोषण से मैच में कितने नंबर है वह बोलता जस्ट पास हो गया डिफाइन नंबर है मैच में
1:12:09
हम उसे पूछते हिंदी में कितने नंबर है बोलता है इतनी नंबर आगे मेरे हिंदी में डिमांड साथ यह मुझसे पूछते हैं फ्रिज में
1:12:15
कितने नंबर है बोलता है फटी नंबर है तो आप बात क्या समझ रहे हो कि आप को एक जो पॉट
1:12:20
सेंटेज पता चली तो पता चल गई आपको कि 60% बॉक्स है पर जवाब देखना शुरु करते हो सब्जेक्ट वाइज तो आप देख सकते हो कि इसके
1:12:28
मार्क्स डिफरेंट डिफरेंट है वही चीज मैं आपको यहां पर भी समझाने कुछ कराओ कि जब आप यहां पर जाओगे परफॉर्मेंस वाले सेक्शन में
1:12:35
और आप देखोगे एवरेज मजाक होगे 17th पोजीशन पर मैसेज सेंड करो इसका मतलब पेज नंबर टू पर महिला एंकरों बट इसके अंदर बहुत सारे
1:12:43
क्वेश्चंस के ऊपर पेज वन प्रैंक कर रहे होंगे अच्छी पोजीशन पर टाइम करोगे और बहुत सारी को इसके ऊपर आप फोर्थ फिफ्थ पोजिशन
1:12:50
के ऊपर भी प्रैंक कर रहे होंगे तो यह उसका एवरेस्ट निकाल कर लेता है तो अगर आपको बहुत ही डीप एनालिसिस करनी है तो आपको
1:12:57
क्या एवरेज के ऊपर काम करना है नहीं अगर आपको आधे पर मालिश करनी है तो आपको थोड़ा स्पेसिफिक होना पड़ेगा स्पेसिफिक कैसे
1:13:04
फिक्स क्वेरी पर कौन से पेज हमारे कितनी एवरेस्ट पोजीशन बना रहा है जिस पर कौन से
1:13:11
पेज कितनी एवरेज पोजीशन मना रहा है ठीक है बस अड्डे से हो सकता है कि एक ही पेज एक
1:13:17
स्पेसिफिक वैरी के ऊपर कुछ टाइम तक वह सेकेंड पोजीशन पर आप फिर कुछ टाइम तक कुछ
1:13:23
लोगों के लिए डिफरेंट लोकेशंस में वह थर्ड पोजीशन पर आप राइट्स अगर मैं एवरेज निकलूंगा तो कितना हो जाएगा थ्री प्लस टू
1:13:29
डिवाइडेड बाय टू यानि कि 2.5 एवरेस्ट पोजीशन उसकी आने के यहां पर तो ठीक है वह
1:13:34
Bigg Boss कि मैं यहां पर और स्पेसिफिक हो गया कि इस पर्टिकुलर क्वेरी पर कौन से पेज
1:13:40
की कितनी पोजीशन है कितनी अ वृत्त पोजीशन है तो यह तो एक बार के लिए जो डिस्कशन है
1:13:45
यह जो नाले से 100 तक ठीक है और यहीं पर मैं पूरी वेबसाइट के एवरेस्ट को ट्यूशन की बात कर रहा हूं तो वहां पर मतलब है इतनी
1:13:52
इज्जत क्लियर डाटा नहीं है तो आपको थोड़ा सा यहां पर कंफ्यूजन होगा समझने में राइट तो मैं यहां पर बात कर रहा था आप आज हम पर
1:14:00
की की कंपेयर को भी यूज करके हमें यहां पर इस टाइप से डाटा कि जो नाले से होकर सकूं और आपको देखोगे अगर आप यहां पर तो आपको दो
1:14:06
तरीके की लाइन दिख रही है कि डॉटेड लाइन आपको दिख रही है और एक आपको जो है वह कंप्लीट लाइन दिख रही है तो यहां पर जो
1:14:13
डॉटेड लाइन है जैसे यहां पर देखो मेंशन भेजो डॉटेड लाइन है वह बेसिकली प्रीवियस थ्री मंथ्स की है और यह वाली जो
1:14:20
है वह लास्ट के अभी कि पिछले दो-तीन महीने हैं उनकी है राइट तो आई विल बी चीज आपको क्लियर हो गई होगी मैं एक बार के यहां पर
1:14:27
कंपेयर को बिना एक बार के लिए रिमूव कर देता हूं और अपना सिंपल सा लास्ट मोंठ एस थे लास्ट थ्री इंच का मैं यहां पर फिल्टर
1:14:33
जो है वह लगा देता हूं पॉइंट अब नहीं चाहते हम लोग यहां पर अगर आप देखो तो यह बता रहा है में कि पेजेस कौन से पेज जिस
1:14:41
पर आपको कितनी तकलीफ मिली है उस पर कितने इंप्रेशंस आफ थे उस पेज का सीटीआर कितना
1:14:47
था और उसकी एवरेज पोजीशन कितनी थी टाइट तो आप यहां पर ही बोलोगे आप किस वर्ग ये भी
1:14:52
तो एवरेज पोजीशन यहां पर ही बता रहा है तो यह पेज वाइब्रैंट पोजीशन का क्या मतलब इसका मतलब यह हुआ कि एक कोरी के ऊपर कोई
1:14:59
एवरीवन के ऊपर अ यह वाला पेज थर्ड पोजिशन प्रैंक कर रहा है इसी को के ऊपर यह वाला
1:15:04
पेज नंबर आफ थिस पोजिशन पर गिरा कर सकता कोई ऋतु के ऊपर कोई दूसरी कोई जैसे डिजिटल मार्केटिंग कोर्स के ऊपर मेरी वेबसाइट अगर
1:15:11
थर्ड पोजिशन पर लैंड कर रही है तो हो सकता है डिजिटल मार्केटिंग ट्रेनिंग के ऊपर मेरी वेबसाइट पोजीशन पर आकर यह तो फिर
1:15:18
प्लस 38 डिवाइडेड बाय टू यह हो गया हमारा फॉर एवरी कुछ इस तरीके से घर पर ही कर रहा
1:15:24
था और तू पर एंकर थे क्वेरी के ऊपर थी पर हमारा पेज लाइक कर रहा था एक वैरी के ऊपर टू फ्रंट कर रहा था तो अगर देखोगे तो फाइव
1:15:31
डिवाइडेड बाय टू 2.5 हमारी जो एवरेज पोजीशन है तो यहां पर हमारी अ वृत्त पोजीशन 2.5 जो है वह आ जाएगी राइट तो आइए
1:15:39
अभी आपको समझ में आ रहा होगा कि एवरेज पॉजिशन का फंडा क्या है तो आप जितने स्पेसिफिक डाटा को स्टडी करोगे उतना आपके
1:15:46
लिए बेहतर है तो यहां पर अगर आप देखो तो आपको अब डिफरेंस समझ में आएगा कि यह वाला जो मरा पेज है ना इसके रखो इतने सारे
1:15:53
इंप्रेशन से 131 इंप्रेशन सुबह बट इसके कोई क्लिक नहीं है नेक्स्ट9 के पीछे जो
1:15:58
रिवीजन था वह आपको अब समझ में आ रहा होगा यहां पर जो आपको दिख रहा है मैं बता दूं आपको
1:16:04
41.6 यहां पर इसकी और इस क्वेश्चन है उसी तरीके से यहां पर देखो तो कोई क्लिक है 701 इंप्रेशंस के बाद भी कोई फिक्स नहीं
1:16:12
आए हैं क्यों नहीं आए पोजिशन फॉर टीथ है फर्स्ट पोजिशन ऑलमोस्ट 40 में पोजीशन पर
1:16:19
आप लाइक करो इस पेज के साथ डिफरेंट डिफरेंट कीवर्ड्स ऊपर राइट तो अभी आपको
1:16:24
बात समझ में आ रही होगी कि यह एवरेज पोजीशन का जो फायदा है वह क्या फाइंड तो
1:16:30
यहां पर हमें जो डाटा दिख रही है वह फिक्स हमें पता चल है इस पेज के कितने क्लिक है इस पेज की कितनी ऑपरेशंस है तो इसका सीट
1:16:36
यार कितना था यह सारी चीजें राइड पेरिस के बारे में पता चल जाता है कि कंट्रीज से हमें कितने क्लिक्स इंप्रेशन सिधार हमारी
1:16:43
क्या पोजीशन है तो इंडिया की से अगर हम बात करें तो आनंद एवरेज जो हमारी पोजीशन इंडिया की बनती है सभी को मिलाकर ठीक है
1:16:50
सभी पेजेस को सभी को ग्रीस को मिलाकर हमारी अंश वर्स्ट पोजीशन इंडिया में बनती है वह 31.2 बनती फाइट जहां पर डिवाइस वही
1:16:59
सेम डाटा है डिवाइस वाइज हमारे जो परफॉर्मेंस वह कैसी है और उसके बाद का डेट
1:17:04
वाइज में देखना चाहूं जैसे स्पेसिफिक डेट वाइज कि 19th को जो हमारी एवरेस्ट पोजीशन
1:17:10
कितनी टी-20 कुमारी कितनी से इस टाइप हम लोग देख सकें डेट वाइज सिगरेट उसके बाद एक बहुत इंपोर्टेंट सेक्शन होता है यहां पर
1:17:16
व्हिच इज कॉल्ड एस कुमार्स राइट तो अगर यहां पर आप देखोगे तो आपको दिख रहे थे लैंग्वेज अकाउंट से यह क्या है यह चोली
1:17:22
ब्रांड ने में तो ब्रांड नेम पर अगर आप देखोगे तो फ्रेंड डिंपल जो आपकी पोजीशन है वह ऑलमोस्ट वन के बराबर है मतलब टॉक पर
1:17:30
आपराधिक कर रहे हो अब ब्रांड नेम के ऊपर उसके बाद इंग्लिश स्पीकिंग क्लासेस इन मुंब्रा ठीक है यह जंगल की बढ़ाकर इसके
1:17:37
ऊपर अ फ्रेंड करो तो अच्छी बात है इसके ऊपर जो आपके फर्स्ट पोजिशन हो 3.8 है लैंग्वेज कुंटल के ऊपर जो आपकी एवरेज
1:17:43
पोजीशन है वह 10.7 है ठीक है अब हम थोड़ा और इस पर होना
1:17:48
चाहिए हमेशा बता आपको कि परफॉर्मेंस का मतलब होता है कि हम कुछ एनालिसिस स्टार्ट करने वाले हैं तो अब मैं यह करने वाला हूं
1:17:56
कि मुझे यह समझना है कि इस पर्टिकुलर क्वेरी के ऊपर मैंने कौन से पेज पर हमारी
1:18:02
अवैध पोजीशन क्या रही है ठीक है तो आप ध्यान से देखना जैसे ही मैं इसको क्लिक करूंगा ऊपर आप देखो एक और फिल्टर आठ हो
1:18:08
गया अब जो यह डाटा है ना यह पूरी इस क्वेरी के लिए डाटा है फाइव तो यहां पर हम
1:18:13
लोग देखे तो सच क्या लिखा हुआ है वेब वेब पेजों पर हम सच करें लास्ट थ्री मंथ्स में इस पर्टिकुलर कोयली के ऊपर मुझे तीन क्लिक
1:18:20
मिलेंगे दोस्तों इंप्रेशन से यह मेरा सिटी अर्थ और यह मेरी एवरेस्ट पोजीशन ठीक है तो
1:18:25
इस पर्टिकुलर क्वेरी के ऊपर हमारे यह डिफरेंट डिफरेंट पेजेस है जो राए कर रहे
1:18:30
थे यह वाला जो हमारा पेन है यह 4.6 क्यों परेशान कर रहा है यह हमारा जो पहले वर्स्ट पोजीशन पर आकर यह वाला जो पॉइंट है यह
1:18:37
हमारा फर्स्ट पोजिशन के ऊपर आयल करता है इस पर्टिकुलर क्वेश्चन के ऊपर फाइंड उसके
1:18:42
बाद घर में कंट्री की बात करूं तो इस पर्टिकुलर कई के ऊपर इंडिया से हमें इतनी क्लिक मिले ऑल इंडिया में जो नंबर एक
1:18:49
पोजीशन बनाई वह इतनी बनी तो आइए आपको समझ में आ रहा का यहां पर आपके पास मल्टीप्ल ऑप्शंस होते हैं पेज वापिस ठीक है पेज
1:18:55
वाइज आप जो है वह एनालिसिस कर सकते हैं फिल्टर लगा सकते हैं कंट्री वाइज आपको समझना है कि किसी स्पेसिफिक कंट्री के
1:19:03
अराउंड आप पूरी परफॉरमेंस रिपोर्ट देखना चाहते हैं तो भी आप कर सकते हैं मैं इसको यूज कर तो यहां से एंड इट्स ए मैनु के ऊपर
1:19:09
जाता हूं कंट्री यहां से ले करता हूं मैं वांट टो स्टडी अराउंड यूनाइटेड स्टेट्स यूनाइटेड स्टेट्स में मेरी लास्ट थ्री
1:19:16
मंथ्स में क्या परफॉर्मेंस आप स्टूडेंट रिकॉर्ड टू राइट यहां पर बहुत सारे हमें फिल्टर सकते हैं जिनको हम लोग यूज कर सकते
1:19:22
एक और बहुत इंपोर्टेंट चीज विकास टू दिस परफॉर्मेंस एक्शन एस कि जब आप अपनी
1:19:29
वेबसाइट को ऑप्टिमाइजेशन करते हो ना तो सलमान के चलते हैं जैसे आप में एक तीव्र सिल्क है डिजिटल मार्केटिंग कोर्स से नहीं
1:19:34
लिया या आपका मेन की वृद्धि जिसको आपने सेलेक्टिव और इसके ऊपर अपने काम करना शुरू किया थोड़े टाइम के बाद आप देखोगे कि जब
1:19:41
डिजिटल मार्केटिंग कोर्स इन इंडिया मान्य है कि वर्धा तो अगर आप इसके ऊपर काम करो आप देखोगे इससे मिलते-जुलते क्वेरी इसके
1:19:49
ऊपर भी आप जो दूसरे पेजेस या वहीं पर है वह ग्रैंड करने लगता है पांच और इसके पीछे
1:19:54
इधर यह है कि जब आप किसी स्पेसिफिक वैरी के लिए अपने वेबपेज को पर ऑप्टिमाइज़ करते
1:20:01
हैं राइट कराने कोशिश करते हैं तो उससे मिलते-जुलते कुरियर इस पर भी वह ट्वाइस हो जाता है ऑटोमेटिकली गूगल को समझ में आने
1:20:07
लगता है कि डिजिटल मार्केटिंग कोर्स इन इंडिया पर है इसका मतलब इससे रिलेटिड जो कर रही है वह डिजिटल मार्केटिंग इन इंडिया
1:20:13
तो उसके ऊपर भी दोहराई चांसेस कि आपका जो चीज है वह मेल्ट होने लगे उससे मिलती-जुलती पर इसके ऊपर राइट होने लगे तो
1:20:19
वह जो क्वैरीज इनके ऊपर आपका पेज रैंक हो रहा है और राय रखने के बावजूद इसके कितने
1:20:25
इंप्रेशन है कितने क्लिक है उसकी एवरेज पोजीशन कितनी बन रही है वह आपको यहां पर इस वाले सेक्शन में देखने को मिल जाते से
1:20:31
आप मिक्स करें और इस वाले सेक्शन में तो ऐसे बहुत सारे कीबोर्ड होते थे अगर आप यहां पर देखो समाचार की वर्ड्स आपको दिख
1:20:38
रहा है तो क्या हम 724 की मृत्यु पर काम कर रहे हैं वह तक नहीं हम हो सकता है आठ-दस की मृत्यु पर काम कर रहे हैं बट
1:20:44
उससे मिलते-जुलते बहुत सारे कीवर्ड के ऊपर भी हमारी वेबसाइट पोजीशन या वेबसाइट ना कहीं धर्म वेबपेजेस बोले ज्यादा ठीक रहेगा
1:20:51
हमारे वैरीयस पोजीशंस बनाने लगते हैं जिसकी वजह से यहां यस वाले सेक्शन में
1:20:57
हमें बहुत सारे जो और कोई तो हमें दिखने लगते हैं और उसके विशेष हम लोग यहां पर पदक और एनालिसिस कर सकते हमें लगता है कि
1:21:05
यह बहुत इंपोर्टेंट क्वेश्चन है तो इनके बेसिस पर हमने पेजेस अगर बनाना चाहें तो वह बना सकते हैं इनके बेसिस पर अगर हम कुछ
1:21:10
ब्लॉग लिखना चाहिए एक कि मुझे बहुत ही अच्छी लगी यह बहुत ही सॉलिड क्वेरी है और
1:21:16
इसके पर क्लिक 11 इंप्रेशन CR है तो इसको यहां से मिलते-जुलते मैं कुछ कीवर्ड सर्च
1:21:21
करूंगा फिर उससे related में कुछ ब्लॉग लिख लूंगा उसको रानी कुछ करूंगा तो वहां
1:21:26
से भी मैं पोटेंशियल ट्रैफिक पढ़ाने की कोशिश करेंगे तो यह सारी चीजें तो स्टडी वाले पार्ट में अज्ञेय आपको बताया कि
1:21:32
रिपोर्ट का मतलब केवल यह होता है कि आपने इस रिपोर्ट देख लिया डेटशीट ऐसा कभी नहीं
1:21:38
करना है मैं रिपोर्ट के बेसिस पर जो डाटा हम लोगों ने देखिए उसके बेसिस पर कुछ हमें एनालिसिस करनी है और ऐनल सेक्स करने के
1:21:45
बाद कुछ न कुछ हमें स्टेप्स भी लेने बना रिपोर्ट का मतलब ही क्या है अगर आप उसे एनालिसिस नहीं कर रहे हैं और कोई स्टेप्स
1:21:51
नहीं ले रहे हैं तो आई बिलीव अभी आप कोई बात समझ में आ गई होगी कि परफॉर्मेंस रिपोर्ट के अंदर हमें क्या-क्या देखने को मिलता है और है किस तरीके से काम करती है
1:21:58
और इस पोजीशन के लोगो पॉइंट बताया इसको थोड़ा सा ध्यान रखिएगा बहुत सारे लोग इसमें कंफ्यूज होते हैं कि एवरेज पोजीशन
1:22:04
में कभी ब्रेस्ट पोजीशन पर फोकस नहीं करता हूं टाइट मैं हमेशा यहां पर कि यह वाली जो मारी कुड़ी है इसको इतने प्रशंसक इतने के
1:22:10
लिए सरकार सीसीआर कितना और इसकी और इस पोजीशन जो है वह कितनी तो इस टाइप समय ज्यादा स्टडी करनी कुछ करता हूं बहुत ही
1:22:16
बड़ी डाटा की एवरेज पोजीशन अगर आप देखोगे तो आप भी कंफ्यूज होते
1:22:23
कई बार ऐसा होता है कि हमारी वेबसाइट पर बहुत सारे फीचर्स होते हैं बटर हम यह चाहते हैं कि उनमें से कुछ भेज यार कुछ
1:22:30
URL हमारे गूगल सर्च में ना दिखाई दे रिसर्च इसके पीछे बहुत सारे हो सकते हमारी
1:22:35
अपनी रिक्वायरमेंट हो सकती कि हम नहीं चाहते हैं कि कुछ हमारे स्पेसिफिक जो पेज है वह गूगल सर्च में दिखाई दे तो अगर हम
1:22:43
इस चीज को करना चाहता हूं किस तरीके से हम कर सकते हमें एक गूगल सर्च के अंदर रिमूवल टूल मिलता है जिसके थ्रू गूगल सर्च से हम
1:22:50
उन यूअर अल्स को रिमूव कर सकते हैं जब गूगल सर्च कंसोल के ऊपर जाओगे तो आप इंडेक्स के अंदर देखोगे आपको एक रिमूवल का
1:22:56
सेक्शन मिलता है और यहां से आप नई रिक्वेस्ट है वह सबमिट कर कौन सी यह कहने का मतलब यह है कि जब आप न्यू रिक्वेस्ट
1:23:02
ऊपर जाएंगे तो यह आपसे पूछता है कि आप किस यूआरएल को गूगल सर्च से रिमूव करना चाहते
1:23:08
हैं उसको आप यहां पर मैंने शंकर को बहुत से लोग कंफ्यूज होते हैं उनको लगता है कि यहां पर अगर हम जुब्बल करेंगे न्यू
1:23:14
रिक्वेस्ट प्रेस करेंगे तो इसका मतलब है कि वह URL हमारी वेबसाइट से रिमूव हो जाएगा इसको बॉईल वेबसाइट से नहीं रुक होगा
1:23:20
वह URL केवल केवल गूगल सर्च से अलग गूगल सर्च के अंदर वह URL अपीयर नहीं होगा वह
1:23:27
या वह पेज नहीं प्यार होगा अब एक और बहुत इंपोर्टेंट चीज वह यह है अब यहां पर ध्यान
1:23:32
से देखो मैं इसको कैंसल भी करता हूं और अगर आप ध्यान से देखो तो यहां पर आपको दिख रहा होगा टेंप्रेरी रिमूवल मतलब यह
1:23:38
परमानेंटली रिमूवल नहीं है मतलब यहां पर अगर आपका वेबसाइट गूगल सर्च से एक बार
1:23:45
रिमूव भी हो गया तो हो सकता है सिक्स मंथ्स बाद वापस जब गूगल का कॉलर आपकी
1:23:50
वेबसाइट ऊपर आएगा और उस URL को देखा तो वापस वह फिर से आपके यूआरएल को गूगल सर्च
1:23:56
के अंदर छोकरा सकता है कहने का मतलब यह एक टेंपरेचर वायरल रिमूवल है जैसे कि आपको
1:24:01
यहां पर नाम से भी दिख रहे हैं टेंप्रेरी पेज रिमूवल है जैसे आपको यहां पर नाम से भी दिख रहा है बट यहां पर सवाल यह होता है
1:24:08
कि सर अगर हम फिर जो है वह परमानेंट हेयर रिमूवल करना चाहिए तो हम कि हमें क्या करना चाहिए स्टेप सोते हैं तो को
1:24:13
परमानेंटली कि मोबाइल के लिए आपको स्पीच को ही रिमूव करना पड़ेगा अपनी वेबसाइट से या फिर उस पर इसको आपको 404 जो है वह
1:24:20
बनाना पड़ेगा आप उस चीज को 404 बना दो तो वह एक तरीके से आपका परमानेंटली रिमूवल वाला जो है वह सलूशन हो सकता है या फिर उस
1:24:27
पेज में नाइन टेक्स्ट ऐप को अगर आप यूज कर लोगे साइड से अच्छी तो परमानेंट हेयर रिमूवल राइट्स बट यहां पर हमें ऑप्शन
1:24:33
मिलता है टेंप्रेरी रिमूवल का तो किस तरह समय करना है न्यू रिक्वेस्ट कर जाना है यहां पर हमारे पास ऑप्शन होता है हम अपना
1:24:39
URL एंटर करें जैसे मैं एग्जांपल के लिए केवल आपको यहां पर बता रहा हूं कि अगर मैं अपना यह url यहां पर एंटर करता हूं ठीक है
1:24:46
और उसके बाद अगर आपको तो आपको दो ऑप्शंस मिलते रिमूव थिस यूआरएल ओनली अगर आप यह चाहते हो कि केवल यही स्पेसिफिक URL गूगल
1:24:53
सर्च से रिमूव हो तो यह आप कर सकते हो अगर आप चाहते हैं कि इस विवाद के बाद जितने भी URL से स्लाइड करके कुछ और भी बंद रहेगा
1:25:00
एंड यूअर अल्ट उनको भी अगर आप रिमूव करना चाहते हो तो फिर आपको यहां पर यह सेकंड वाला जो ऑप्शन है वह सेलेक्ट करना है बड़े
1:25:06
ध्यान से आप हमें सलेक्ट करना पड़ता है कि आप नहीं कोई गलत रिमूवल ना करने दे इस चीज का ध्यान रखिएगा यहां पर जो मैंने भी आपको
1:25:12
इस चीज एक्सप्लेन कर है वह यहां पर भी लिखी हुई ब्लॉग यूआरएल फ्रॉम गूगल सर्च रिजल्ट्स फॉर सिक्स मंथ्स एंड टीचर करंट
1:25:19
स्निप्पेट एंड कैश वर्जन अगर गूगल के पास ऑलरेडी कुछ निपट बन चुके हैं इस रिपोर्ट
1:25:24
मतलब यहां पर जो आप जानते हो जैसे मैं अगर यहां पर आ जाऊं और यहां पर आने के बाद लूट
1:25:30
से मैं डिजिटल मार्केटिंग टाइप करता हूं यहां पर तो यह जो आप लिपिड देख रहे हो जैसे यहां पर हम लोग आ जाते हैं यहां पर
1:25:38
आप देख रहें हैं जैसे यह एक स्निप्पेट बंद है राइट तो इस निपट को क्लियर कर देता है जो कैसे वर्जन इसका जो स्टोर होता है उसको
1:25:46
भी यह क्लियर कर देता है क्योंकि यह जो यह वाला जो हमारा स्पेसिफिक पेज है इसका कुछ कैसे वर्जन भी गूगल के पास जो है वह स्टोर
1:25:53
होगा यह पेज गूगल किस तरीके से देखता है दरअसल क्लियर कैश वर्जन तो उसको भी यह
1:25:58
क्लियर कर देता है अगर लोग यहां पर रिमूवल करते हैं ठीक है तो वह चीज आप देख तो करंट
1:26:03
पैटर्न कैसेट वर्जन देओल भी रीजेनरेटेड आफ्टर द नेक्स्ट कैरल ठीक है फॉर परमानेंट
1:26:09
रिमूवल आफ जब पेजेस फ्रॉम इंडेक्सिंग जो मैंने बताया 9 एंड एक्सट्रैक्ट से अब्सोर्ब कर सकते हैं और रिमूव थम फ्रॉम
1:26:16
10 साइड वेबसाइट से रिमूव कर दो और 404 पर आप डायरेक्ट कर दो तो आइडिया भी आपको यह
1:26:21
बात समझ में आ रही होगी कि न्यू रिक्वेस्ट का यहां पर मतलब क्या है और टेंपररी रिमूवल का क्या मतलब होता है उसके बाद गैस
1:26:28
हम यहां पर अपडेटेड कंटेंट का ऑप्शन मिलता है अब यहां पर अगर कोई भी यूजर इंटरनेट के
1:26:33
ऊपर यह माफ करता है कि आपका जो webpage है वह अपडेटेड कंटेंट वाला webpage है तो फिर
1:26:39
यहां पर आपको वह यौन वगैरह यहां पर आपको जितने और उनका स्टेटस हैं जो भी आपको कि
1:26:44
हमारे वेबसाइट मैंने यह तो मैं आपको अभी यहां पर यह चीज दिखा नहीं सकता टेंप्रेरी में अगर हम कोई नहीं न्यू रिक्वेस्ट भेज
1:26:51
करेंगे तो वह हमारे यहां पर दी जाएगी URL टाइप किया है रिक्वेस्ट और उसका जो स्टेटस वह हम यहां पर बिक जाएगा तो बस यार मैंने
1:26:58
यहां पर इंपोर्टेंट चीज यह है कि वह लोग उसको परमानेंटली हेयर रिमूवल का ऑप्शन समझते हैं बटर है नहीं टेंप्रेरी झंवर
1:27:05
ऑप्शन उसके बाद गए यहां पर तो आपको यह सेव सर्च फिल्टरिंग को ऑप्शन दिखेगा सीधा सा मतलब यह था कि अगर कोई यूजर आपकी वेबसाइट
1:27:12
कंटेंट है उसको अडल्ट माफ करता है नोट सिर्फ माफ करता है तो फिर वह वायरस आपको
1:27:17
यहां पर दिखाई देंगे जिनकी भी रिक्वेस्ट रेस हुई होगी कई यहां पर जब आप Google सर्च कंसोल में
1:27:25
आप अपने आते हैं तो आप देख सकते हो यहां पर आपको लेकर सिटीज़न रिपोर्ट के अंदर है कि आपको टू दिख रहा होगा जिसका नाम है URL
1:27:32
पैरामीटर्स तो आज के इस वीडियो में हम लोग इसी चीज की बात करने वाले हैं कि आखिर यह URL पैरामीटर का ऑप्शन यहां पर क्यों दे
1:27:39
रखा है और क्यों हम लोग इस वीडियो की बात कर रहे हैं इसके पीछे जो रीजन है वह यह है
1:27:45
जो यहां पर आप देख रहे हो इस रिपोर्ट विल नॉट बे अवेलेबल आफ्टर ट्वेंटी 20 6 अप्रेल
1:27:50
मतलब एक महीने के बाद लगभग-लगभग अगर आप आज सही दिन पर वीडियो देख रहे हैं जिस दिन
1:27:55
मैंने अपलोड किया हुआ है तो एक महीने के बाद लगभग यह वाला जो टूल कि वह डिस्कंटीन्यू कर देगा गूगल सर्च कंसोल तो
1:28:03
इसका ऑप्शन हमें नहीं दिखेगा तो जो मेन पॉइंट है कि क्यों हम लोग इस वीडियो को
1:28:08
यहां पर जो है लेकर आएं आप लोगों के लिए यह है कि अगर URL पैरामीटर्स वाला जो
1:28:14
ऑप्शन है वह चला जाएगा तो जो समस्या URL पैरामीटर्स टूल हमारे लिए सॉल्व करता है
1:28:20
उस समस्या का सलूशन क्या है ठीक है तो इन सब चीजों को डिस्कस करेंगे ध्यान से देखिए बहुत इंपोर्टेंट वीडियो है सबसे पहले हम
1:28:27
लोग समझते हैं कि URL पैरामीटर क्या होता है तो यहां पर आप हमारी वर्डप्रेस की वेबसाइट के ऊपर और यह जो डमी वेबसाइट है
1:28:34
इसको आप देख रहे हो जैसे ही यह वेबसाइट यहां पर है आप लोगों के सामने तो अगर आप यहां पर कोई एक प्रोडक्ट को ओपन करते हैं
1:28:40
जैसे मैं यह वाले पॉइंट को ओपन करता हूं तो आप ध्यान से इसका URL देखिए आपको यहां पर इसका यह लिख रहा है बट वहीं पर अगर मैं
1:28:47
कुछ भी सर्च करता हूं इस समय यहां पर गया और मैं यहां पर सर्च किया न्यू और न्यू मैं सर्च करता हूं अब ध्यान से आपको यहां
1:28:55
पर आपका जो URL है वह किस टाइप कर तो जो यह आप देख रहें हैं ना एस यह जो आपको यहां
1:29:00
पर दिख रहा है दिस इज एक्चुअली द पैरामीटर तो पॉइंट यह है कि हम लोग नहीं चाहते हैं
1:29:06
कि जो पैरामीटर बेस्ट जो यह वायरल होते हैं उनको गूगल इंडेक्ड करें यह रीजन होता
1:29:12
है कि हम पैरामीटर बेस्ट जो URL हैं उनको यू आर पार मीटर वाले टूल के हेल्प है फिर
1:29:18
रिमूव करना नहीं चाहते हैं कि Google उनको इंडेक्स करें क्योंकि अगर आप यहां पर देखो
1:29:23
तो यह तो हमारा पैरामीटर है और जब हम को सर्च करते हैं ना तो जो भी नया हमारा URL
1:29:29
बनता है वह URL के अंदर जो भी प्रोडक्ट होते हैं ना वह आलरेडी जो प्रोडक्ट्स अपलोड है उन्हें करी अरेंजमेंट होता है इस
1:29:37
बात को और अच्छे तरीके से समझना चाहो तो मैं यह फोन के ऊपर आ जाता हूं आपको अभी समझ में आ जाएगा कि पैरामीटर यूआरएल का
1:29:43
फंडा क्या है यहां पर Amazon पर मैं एक बार के लिए सर्च करता हूं लैपटॉप ठीक है जैसे मैंने लैपटॉप सर्च किया अब देखिए
1:29:50
यहां पर बहुत सारे रिजल्ट्स पा रहे हैं ठीक है जो पेज का कंटेंट है वह आपको यहां पर दिख रहा है बहुत सारा यहां पर जो है
1:29:56
लैपटॉप से रिजल्ट आपको दिखाएं अगर मैं भेजो टॉप की सिक्वेंसिंग गैस को ऊपर नीचे
1:30:02
कर दूं तो जो इस पेज का कंटेंट है ना उसमें कोई चेंज नहीं आएगा इस बात को समझो मतलब एक नार्मल तो हमारा यह वाला पेज हो
1:30:09
गया और सेकंड हम एक और पेज की बात करें और नए URL कि हम लोग बात करें जहां पर हम लोग
1:30:14
क्या कर रहे हैं इस वाले लैपटॉप को ऊपर कर दे रहे इस वाले लैपटॉप को नीचे करते तो आप देख रहे हो आप दो पेजेस बन गए बट क्या
1:30:20
दोनों ही पेजेस के ऊपर कांटेक्ट डिफरेंट नहीं दोनों ही इज्जत के ऊपर कॉन्टेंट सेम है तो जब दोबारा वाला जो पेट हमारा जनरेट
1:30:28
होता है जैसे यह लो टॉप ऊपर चला गया और यह लाइफ नीचे आ गया लिस्टिंग ऊपर चली गई और
1:30:33
यह वाली लिपस्टिक नीचे आ गई और ऐसा जो हमारा सेकंडरी पर जेनरेटर होता है आप
1:30:38
पैरामीटर URL के साथ उस पर्टिकुलर पेज को हम लोग नहीं चाहते कि वह लोपेज जो है वह
1:30:44
इंडेक्सों क्योंकि आप अ डुप्लीकेट पेजेस का जो इशू है वह क्रिएट हो जाएगा क्योंकि हो जाएगा यह कांटेस्ट से दोनों सेम है बट
1:30:50
जो अरेंजमेंट है ना वही तो डिफरेंट हुआ कि यह वाली लिस्टिंग ऊपर चली गई यह नीचे आ गया कुछ नीचे के लिस्टिंग सुपर आ गई यह जो
1:30:56
अरेंजमेंट है उसमें हमें डिफरेंस देखने को मिला अवार्ड एक्चुअली जो इस नंबर पर एक है वहीं डिफर हुआ तो कॉन्टेंट of the Page
1:31:03
अगर दोनों ही पेजेस के ऊपर सेम है और दोनों के URL अलग-अलग है तो दो डिफरेंट डिफरेंट यूअर अल्स गूगल इसको कंसीडर करेगा
1:31:10
डुप्लीकेट का इस हो जाएगा तो इस चीज को अगर प्रैक्टिकली देखना चाहो तो जैसे मैं यहां सॉर्ट बाय पर जाता हूं आप देखोगे अगर
1:31:16
मैं यहां पर कुछ भी सर्च करता हूं जैसे मैंने यहां पर हाउ टू लो सर्च किया ठीक है तो आप देखोगे यहां पर फालतू लोग जैसे ही
1:31:23
मैं सर्च करता हूं तो यहां पर अगर आप देखो तो यहां पर आपको एक ऐसा बिखरा यहां पर ऐसे
1:31:28
ठीक है जिस जगह ना पैरामीटर जो आप यहां पर देख रहा हो यहां पर जो आपको CR ID दिख रहा है यह भी एक पैरामीटर है यहां पर यह क्यों
1:31:35
ID दिख रहा है यह भी आपको यह पैरामीटर दिख रहा है तो यहां पर डिफरेंट डिफरेंट पैरामीटर्स है तो जब हम यहां पर यह कुछ
1:31:41
चेंजेस किए यहां पर तो क्या हमारे पेज का जो कॉन्टेंट है वह चेंज हुआ नहीं पेज का
1:31:47
कंटेंट भाई राबर्ट सॉर्ट इन हो गई हाईट ब्लॉग्स उसी तरीके से अगर मैं यहां पर आता हूं और मैं यहां पर जाता हूं और लो टू हाई
1:31:54
करता हूं ठीक है तो लो टू हाई में भी अगर आप देखोगे तो आपके पेज का कंटेंट नहीं चेंज हुआ था चीज का हुआ सफल हो गया बस वह
1:32:01
की जो प्रोजेक्टर प्राइस लो था वह नीचे से ऊपर आ गए तो यह कुछ अरेंजमेंट हो गया तो ऐसे के इसमें हम नहीं चाहते हैं कि जो यह
1:32:10
हमने जब चेंज किया पर जब शॉपिंग करनी तो जो URL में चेंजेस हुए तो हम नहीं चाहते हैं कि वह दूसरा वाला जो URL है वह
1:32:18
इंटैक्ट हो तो हम उस पैरामीटर को ही एक्सक्लूड मार देते हैं कि URL पैरामीटर
1:32:24
की हेल्प से अब ध्यान से समझना यह काम आज के टाइम में रोबोट प्रोटेक्टिव की भी
1:32:29
हेल्प से हो जाता है और गूगल का कहना है कि भाई जब रोबोट चिट्टी के है उससे भी हम
1:32:35
डिफ़ाल्ट कर देते हैं यू आर अलार्म्स को पैरामीटर्स वाले जो यह वायरल होते हैं उनको जब हम इसे लागू कर दे तो यह वायरल
1:32:41
पैरामीटर टूल की क्या जरूरत है और आज के टाइम में गूगल के एक रोलर बहुत स्मार्ट हो गया वह समझ जाते हैं कि जो पैरामीटर बेस्ट
1:32:49
यह वायरल बन रहा है पेजेस बन रहे उनको इंडेक्स करने की जरूरत नहीं है जो नार्मल वाले तो उनको इंडेक्स करो इसीली 10 साल से
1:32:57
इसको डिस्कंटीन्यू करें थोड़ी समझ में आ गया कि ड्यूटी कर रहा है इसका भी आंसर मिल गया कि अगर फिर ऐसी समस्या आती है तो फिर
1:33:04
उस पार्टिकुलर केस में रोबोट और टेस्टी को यूज कर सकते हैं या गूगल अपने आप इतना समझदार है गूगल का सिस्टम है वह कि वह जो
1:33:12
प्रॉब्लम है Google क्यों समझ जाते हैं कि पैरामीटर्स वाले वायरस को एक्सक्लूड मारना है बट अगर हमें पहले करना होता था किस
1:33:19
तरीके से हम लोग करते थे वह भी देख लीजिए आप लोग यहां पर समय आता हूं और यह वाला हमारा जो पैरामीटर तो यह पैरामीटर होता है
1:33:26
जो आप ऐसे इज इक्वल टू देख रहे हो और जो न्यू आप देख रहे हैं यह पैरामीटर की वाली होती जो मैं यहां पर डालते हैं तो हमें जो
1:33:32
एक टूटकर मैं वह यह करना तो मैं इसको कॉपी मानता हूं यहां से यहां पर वापस आते हैं हम लोग और यहां पर हम लोग एंड पेरीमीटर पर
1:33:38
जाते और पैरामीटर का नाम क्या है वह मैं यहां पेस्ट कर देता हूं ठीक है अब ध्यान से देखिए यहां पर लिखा हुआ है ड्रेस
1:33:44
पैरामीटर चेंज्ड इट्स कंटेंट्स इन नोएडा यूजर हवाई पेज का कंटेंट को यह चेंज कर
1:33:49
रहा है लेकिन पेज के कॉन्टेंट को इफेक्ट नहीं कर रहा है क्या कर रहा है चेंजेस कर रहा है रिवर्स करना या न करना मतलब कि
1:33:56
आपने कोई फिल्टर लगा दिया ठीक है बहुत सारी वेबसाइट पर तो फिर डर लग जाता है तो फिल्टर जब लग जाएगा तो क्या कर रहे हो
1:34:02
नौकर है फिर इसको यहां पर मैं लिखूंगा यह चेंजेस रीवार्ड्स कर रहा है या नेटवर्क है तो पैरों को सेलेक्ट कर लूंगा हाउ डस द
1:34:09
पैरामीटर फैक्टर पेज कंटेंट कैसे इफेक्ट करता है किन्नरों कर रहा है यह अगर मैंने लो कर रहा हूं तो मैं लिख दूंगा सॉस कर
1:34:15
रहा है तो मैं स्मार्ट लिखवा दूंगा ठीक है उसके बाद करना क्या है विच यू आर द प्राइम मिनिस्टर शोल्ड गूगल व्हाट रोल रुकूंगा नो
1:34:23
यू आर इस पर मीटर के साथ जितने भी अलार्म जनरेट हो रहे हैं सब को नाजुक रोलिंग है
1:34:29
ना वह लिमिट कर दो करौली नहीं करवानी उनकी इस तरीके से आप करके इस को सेव कर सकते
1:34:34
हैं आपको यूअर इसकी ठीक-ठाक समझ होनी चाहिए आपको पैरामीटर्स की ठीक-ठाक समझ
1:34:39
होनी चाहिए तभी आप यह तो यह पैरामीटर वाला टूल इसको यूज कर पाएंगे तो करने की जरूरत ही नहीं पड़े क्योंकि ये 26 सारी से चला
1:34:46
जाए जरूरी था कि जो टूट जाने वाले उसके बारे में थोड़ी आपको इंफॉर्मेशन मिल जाए ताकि आपको कंफेशन ना हो कि यह क्या चीज थी
1:34:53
और इसी आप समस्या आती तो वह कैसे सॉल्व होगी सफल होने का तरीका मैंने बताया रोबोट सौंठ एक व्हाट्सएप टेक्स्ट है प्रॉब्लम जो
1:35:00
है वह सॉल्व हो जाती तो बहुत टेस्टी में आप खजूर सेंटेंस व हो जाता है मैं आपको
1:35:05
दिखा देता हूं किस टाइप का फिरोज सेंटेंस होगा कि यहां पर मैंने मित्रा का जो रोबोट्स और टिकती है वह ओपन किया हुआ है
1:35:12
तो यहां पर अगर आप देखोगे और मैं सर्च को यहां पर उठाता हूं जैसे आप देख रहा इस सच
1:35:18
के साथ अगर कोई वायरल बनता है तो वह यहां पर आप देख रहे इन्होंने डिफ़ाल्ट कर दिया तो इसी तरीके से ही वायरल स्कोर डिसोल्व
1:35:25
किया जा सकता है यहां पर जो हमें रोबोट विकसित फाइल मिलती है उसके थ्रू उसी तरीके
1:35:30
से मैंने कोई की ना Amazon कभी रोबोट और टेक्स्ट फाइल जो है यहां पर उठा ली अब देखिए यहां पर यहां पर आपको और अच्छी समझ
1:35:36
में आएगा का यहां पर अगर आप देखो तो डिसएलाऊ में आप क्या देख रहे हो सर्च के बाद यहां पर आप देख रहें हैं कि इस टाइप
1:35:42
से अगर चीजें आ रही हैं तो सारी डी सलाह है और इसी टाइप का पर जनरेट हो रही है देखो इस क्वेश्चन मार्क के इस रिकॉर्ड
1:35:48
उद्देश एंड एस इक्वल टू देश तो यह सारे जो चीज है नाम अगर पैरामीटर्स बेस्ट यह चीजें
1:35:55
किसी URL में आती हैं तो इस धूल की वजह से वो पिशाब हो जाएंगे तो यह भजन परम मित्र
1:36:00
वाला यह वाला जो ऑप्शन है वह हमारा इस पर्टिकुलर चीज से भी सवाल हो जाएगा जो
1:36:07
रोबोट स्टार्ट पीएम तो गाइस अगर हम लोग लेंगे हमें इन्हें 10
1:36:12
मिनट रिपोर्ट्स कहां पर दिखाई देती हैं तो आप देख सकते हो गूगल सर्च कंसोल में यहां पर आपको यह इनहांसमेंट रिपोर्ट्स दिखाई दे
1:36:18
रही है बट एक चीज जो बहुत ही ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट है अगर आप इस वेबसाइट की बात यह आप देख रहें हैं इन्हें 10 मिनट के
1:36:24
अंदर आपको यह चीज दिख रही है दैट इज लोगोस बट कई बार ऐसा होता है कि अगर आप किसी
1:36:30
दूसरी वेबसाइट को फस जाएंगे और आप इनहांसमेंट रिपोर्ट देखेंगे तो आपको डिफरेंट चीजें दिखाईं मैं आपको दिखा देता
1:36:36
हूं दूसरी वेबसाइट पर सर्च करके तो अगर मैं दूसरी वेबसाइट पर आ चुका हूं और अगर आप यहां पर देखिए तो आप देख सकते हैं यहां
1:36:42
सीमेंट के अंदर आपको ब्रेड क्रम्स दिख रहा है लोगों से दिख रहा है रिव्यू स्निपेट्स भी आपको यहां पर देखना है टाइटनिंग सर्च
1:36:48
बॉक्स दिख रहा है और अनपासिबल स्ट्रक्चर्ड डाटा यहां पर दिख रही है तो ऐसा क्या है कि एक वेबसाइट में गूगल सर्च कंसोल करेंगे
1:36:55
इसमें वाले सेक्शन के अंदर हम क्यों लिखी थी करो जहां पर हमें मल्टीपल चीज दिखेगी जो इसको समझ चाणक्य समझना पड़ेगा कि यह जो
1:37:01
हमारी इनहांसमेंट के रिपोर्ट्स है यह किस तरीके से जनरेट होती है तो वह इनहांसमेंट की रिपोर्ट आपको यह बताती है कि आपकी
1:37:09
वेबसाइट पर पुष्प चक्र डाटा है और आसान शब्दों में अगर आप समझना चाहे तो जो आप स्कीम आप अपनी वेबसाइट यू पर लगाते हैं
1:37:16
जैसे अगर आपने हरी वाला इसकी मारकर लगाया तो आपको इनहांसमेंट वाले सेक्शन के अंदर रिव्यू स्निप्पेट का भी रिपोर्टिंग दी
1:37:23
जाएगी अगर आपने वहां पर जो है ब्लैक से लोगों से रिलेटेड कोई स्कीम लगा लोगों से
1:37:29
रिलेटेड टो इस कीमत होता है जो आप वेबसाइट इस क्रीम लगाते हैं उसी के अंदर आप लोगों का यूअर डालने जो आपके लोगो इमेज होती उसी
1:37:35
कि आप यूआरएल वहां पर डालते हैं तो अगर आपने वेबसाइट्स की मां अपनी वेबसाइट पर लगाया है और उसके अंदर लोगों और जो है
1:37:42
मिशन कि आपने लोग ही वायरल वहां पर मिशन क्या हुआ है उसकी मां के अंदर तो Google सर्च कंसोल के इनहांसमेंट वाली रिपोर्ट के
1:37:48
अंदर आपको लोगों का ऑप्शन दिखेगा है उसी तरीके से यहां जैसे कि आप देख रहे साइटलिंक सर्च बॉक्स अगर आप में साइक्लिंग
1:37:54
सर्च बॉक्स वाला स्कीम आपने अपनी वेबसाइट पर लगाया है तो यह फ्रंट वाले सेक्शन के अंदर वह चीज ऑटोमेटिक तु जनरेट हो जाएगी
1:38:01
और आपको उस टाइप की जो रिपोर्ट है वह यहां पर दिखाई देगी तो बहुत सारे लोग जो इधर से
1:38:06
स्पेशल जब यह पूछने के साथ मेरे इनहांसमेंट वाली रिपोर्ट के अंदर से बहुत ही कम रिपोर्ट दिख रही है आपके इनहांसमेंट
1:38:11
वाली रिपोर्ट सेंटर तो बहुत ज्यादा रिपोर्ट दिख रही इसका सीधा सा मतलब यही है कि जो भी स्ट्रक्चर्ड डाटा हमारी वेबसाइट
1:38:17
के ऊपर डिटेक्ट होगी उसी कि आप देखोगे यहां पर एडवांसमेंट रिपोर्ट में आपको यहां पर वह चीज दिखाई दे कि अब दूसरा सवाल यह
1:38:24
आता है कि यह जो रिपोर्ट है यह हमें क्या पता थी मुझको जब हम अपनी वेबसाइट के ऊपर स्ट्रक्चर्ड डाटा टो इंप्लीमेंट करते हैं
1:38:30
तो हो सकता है वह स्ट्रक्चर डाटा ठीक तरीके से इंप्रूवमेंट न हो पाए उसमें कोई अफेयर हो या वह ठीक तरीके से नहीं
1:38:37
इंप्लीमेंट है तो इससे रिलेटिड कोई गूगल हमें वार्निंग देना चाहता हूं अगर ठीक तरीके से प्लेसमेंट हो चुका है तो वह बोल
1:38:43
दे कि यह सारी चीजें जो है वह ली है तो कहने का मतलब स्कीम आफ डाटा जो हमारी वेबसाइट को परमिट है वह सही तरीके से
1:38:49
ट्रीटमेंट हुई है या नहीं हुई वह सारी चीजें हमें इनहांसमेंट वाले सेक्शन के अंदर दिखाई देती है अब इसका नाम
1:38:56
इनहांसमेंट क्यों है आप खुद ही समझ जाओगे उनको जब हम इसकी मां डेट आफ बर्थ अ यूज करते हैं तुम्हारा फर्ज क्या होता है कि
1:39:02
हम सर्च रिज़ल्टस में जो मरा प्रेजेंट है जिस तरीके से हमारी वेबसाइट सर्च रिजल्ट्स
1:39:07
में दिख रही है सचिन रिजल्ट पेज के ऊपर दिख रही है कि वैरी पर साइज उसको थोड़ा सा इन हंस करना चाहिए हम चाहते हैं रिव्युस
1:39:13
में दिखाए हम चाहते वहां पर साइटलिंक का जो सच बॉक्स है वह भी वहां पर दिखाए जाते हैं ब्रेड क्रम्स भी वहां पर देखें तो ऐसी
1:39:20
जब डिफरेंट डिफरेंट सिनेरियस हम चाहते हैं तो इसके लिए हम कीमत डाटा लगाते रहते हैं और इसके लिए हम कर क्या रहे हैं हम
1:39:26
इनहांसमेंट कर रहे हैं और यहां पर अगर आप देखो तो लोगों से आपको यहां पर दिखा है ठीक है लोगों इनहांसमेंट में अगर हम लोग
1:39:32
यहां पर देखें तो अपडेट्स तो यहां पर लिखा हुआ है अगर कोई नहीं है मतलब जिस भी किमाम डाटा के साथ मैंने लोग उसको यूज किया होगा
1:39:39
वह सब कुछ ठीक है अब हम लोग देख भी लेंगे इसको और उसके बाद अगर मैं बेल्ट के ऊपर जाता हूं तो आप देखोगे यहां पर आपको
1:39:45
कंप्लीट बिखरा स्टेटस कंप्लीट टाइप इस कंप्लीट आइटम्स एंड एवरी थिंग इज फाइन फाइन तो जब मैं इसके ऊपर क्लिक करूंगा
1:39:52
राइट और यहां पर आप देखोगे तो किस पर्टिकुलर यह वायरल के ऊपर इस लोगों
1:39:59
इन्हीं फ्लैशलाइट को इन्होंने फाइंड आउट किया और बोला कि वह ठीक है वह आप यहां पर देख सकते हैं ठीक है और कब डिटेक्टेड वह
1:40:05
डेट भी आप देख सकते हो तो अगर मैं इसके ऊपर क्लिक करूंगा तो आप देख सकते हैं जैसे मैंने इसके ऊपर क्लिक यहां पर सूट कोड ओपन
1:40:12
हो गया और मुझे पता चल रहा है यहां पर लोगों कहां पर यूज किया गया जिसे आप देख सकते हैं यह देखिए जो आप यहां पर आपको
1:40:17
लोगो यहां पर दिख रहा है तो इसी टाइप से आप की मार्कशीट करते थे यह बेसिकली इसकी मांग काफी है अगर आप ऊपर आ जाओ यहां पर
1:40:25
देखकर आपको समझ में आ जाएगा इसकी मां डाटा यहां पर देखो आप एचटीटीपीएस की में डॉट
1:40:30
ओआरजी लिखा हुआ है अगर मैं इसको आपको थोड़ा सा कॉपी करके दिखाना चाह तो मैं दिखा सकूं यहां से ताकि आपको थोड़ी सी
1:40:36
चीजें क्लियर हो यहां पर दिख जाए मैं एक बार के लिए इसको कॉपी कर लेता हूं यहां से
1:40:42
एंड लेट्स ओपन नोटपैड और यहां पर मैं आपको दिखा देता हूं जिससे यह जो हमारी स्किन
1:40:48
में डाटा है वह यह है ठीक है तो इसकी डाटा आप देख सकते हैं यहां पर किस टाइप की ऑर्गेनाइजेशंस क्रीम है अब ऑर्गेनाइजेशंस
1:40:55
की मां में नेम यू आर है लोगों को अब यह वाले लोगों वाला जो आप देख सकते हैं यहां पर इन्फो क्वेश्चन है इसकी वजह से आपको
1:41:02
यहां पर इनहांसमेंट वाले सेक्शन में लोगों से दिख रहा है वहीं पर कोई एरर होता तो
1:41:07
फिर वह भी आपको पता चला था कि यहां पर आपको कोई अदर है या आपने कोई और जो इसकी मां डाटा है उसमें कुछ प्रॉब्लम क्रिएट कर
1:41:14
दीजिए अपने कोमल लगाना छोड़ दिया या अपने प्रैक्िटस लगाने छोड़ दिया जो सेंटेंस को ध्यान से नहीं लिखा तो उस पर्टिकुलर कि
1:41:20
इसमें एडिट तो कर लेगा किसकी मां डाटा है पर उसमें कोई ना कोई प्रॉब्लम है तो यह सारी इन्फॉर्मेशन आपको यह 10 मिनट्स के
1:41:26
थ्रू मिलती है कि अगर आप इसकी डाटा में कोई प्रॉब्लम है यश लडेगा में कोई प्रॉब्लम है तो उसको आप यहां पर रिवॉल्वर
1:41:32
कर सकते हैं और कॉल कर सकते हैं तो यहां पर आप देखें बहुत सारे जो है विधानसभा इसके अंदर आपको रिपोर्ट दिख रही है वहीं
1:41:39
पर अगर मैं अपनी बात करूं तो यहां पर एक ऐसा वायरल मुझे यह जो आप लोगों दिखा देता
1:41:44
हूं यह देखिए यह दिख रहा है यहां पर पानसिंह मीटिंग को माया कर ली ड्रेस हमने मिस किया है वापिस को पर क्लिक करेंगे तो
1:41:50
URL आपको पता चल जाएगा कि किस url पर यह प्रॉब्लम है फिर जाकर आप इस प्रॉब्लम को सॉल्व कर सकते हैं और दिन उसके बाद जब
1:41:58
आपके फेस वापस इंडेक्स यह फिर प्रॉब्लम आपकी साल हो जाएंगे यहां से जो है वह आपका
1:42:03
हेयर यहां से रिमूव हो जाएगा तो बहुत छोटा सा फीचर है और बहुत सारे लोग जो कंफ्यूज
1:42:08
होते हैं इस वाले फीचर में वह इसीलिए होते हैं इस पर मेरे मेरे इनहांसमेंट रिपोर्ट ज्यादा दिख रही है आपके वेट कम दिख रही है
1:42:14
क्या ऐसा क्यों है कि मेरे गूगल सर्च कंसोल में कोई गड़बड़ी नहीं आपके गूगल सर्च कंसोल में कोई गड़बड़ी नहीं है
1:42:19
इनहांसमेंट रिपोर्ट्स अकॉर्डिंग टू द वेबसाइट जो है वह जनरेट होगी और हो
1:42:25
तो इस हम लोग बात करेंगे कि जो हमें यहां पर सिक्योरिटी एंड इलेक्शन को आप्शन दिख
1:42:30
रहा है इसके अंदर जो में मैंगो लक्षण दिख रहा है यहां पर तो जैसे आप देख सकते हो कि अब इस प्रोग्राम वेबसाइट ऊपर कोई भी
1:42:35
मैनुअल एक्शन नहीं है या मानो लक्षण से रिलेटेड कोई भी इशूज हाउ टो एडिट नहीं हुआ था बट हम लोग यहां पर से समझने वाले हो यह
1:42:42
समझने वाले हैं कि मानव लक्षण क्या होते क्यों गूगल मैंने इलेक्शंस हमारी वेबसाइट के ऊपर लेता है हम क्या कर सकते हैं
1:42:49
मैनुअल एक्शंस ना हमारी वेबसाइट यू पर यह मैंने इलेक्शन इश्यू से हम बस सके इसके
1:42:54
लिए हम लोग क्या कर सकते हैं और अगर गूगल हमारी वेबसाइट यू पर मैंने इलेक्शंस लेता है उस पर्टिकुलर कि इसमें हमें कि को
1:43:00
नुकसान होने वाले इन सब चीजों का हम लोग इस प्रॉब्लम वीडियो में बहुत ही डिटेल में समझने वाले हैं चाहे वह मैंने इलेक्शन के
1:43:05
रिस्पेक्ट मैं हूं चाहे वह सिक्योरिटी इश्यूज पर आप सबसे बड़ा में यह समझता है कि मानव एक्शंस का मतलब है जो कि आप यहां
1:43:11
पर देख रहे हो यह भी इस पर्टिकुलर वेबसाइट ऊपर कोई भी मैंने इलेक्शन जो है वह डिटेक्ट नहीं हुआ था बट मांगलिक शंकर का
1:43:17
मतलब होता है इसको सबसे पहले हम लोग समझते हैं देखो हमारी वेबसाइट के ऊपर गूगल दो तरीके से जो कमेंट है वह लगा सकता है तो
1:43:24
यह कि जो Google के वॉर्ड में वह रोल करते रहते हैं और अगर उन्हें कुछ भी स्पेस लगता है कोई ऐसी एक्टिविटी उनको देखने को मिलती
1:43:30
है जो Google की पॉलिसी इसके अगेंस्ट है तो वहां पर हमारी वेबसाइट जरूर आएगी है यह
1:43:35
हमारे जो वेबसाइट कैसी है वह इफेक्ट में आ सकता है क्योंकि Google को या गूगल के रोबोट को गूगल की जो गाइडलाइंस हैव ए
1:43:42
मास्टर गाइड लाइन है उनके वह अगेंस्ट लगता है एक तो यह चीज हो गई दूसरी चीज है वह यह है कि Google पर बहुत सारे ऐसे इंप्लाइज
1:43:49
हैं और ऐसे रिप्रेजेंटेटिव्स है जो मैन बोली आपकी वेबसाइट को चेक करते हैं अगर उन्हें आपकी वेबसाइट में कोई प्रॉब्लम लग
1:43:56
गई अब इसके बाद हम लोग अलग करेंगे कि वह प्रॉब्लम क्या है वह का प्यार इससे जिनकी वजह से मानव लक्षण होते हैं बट मानव लक्षण
1:44:03
जैसे नाम से पता चल रहा है यह वह एक्शंस है जो Google के रिप्रेजेंटेटिव्स रिप्रेजेंटेटिव्स या ह्यूमन सा उनको बोलो
1:44:10
ट्यूमर है वह आपकी वेबसाइट पर लेते हैं ऐसे एक्शंस ज्यादा खतरनाक होते हैं क्योंकि इनको रिमूव कर पाना उतना ही इजी
1:44:17
नहीं होता और हम अक्षत भी रिमूव किया जा सकता है अगर आप कोई होंगे तो यहां पर आपको
1:44:23
जाएंगे कि आपके ऊपर यह लिया गया और उसके पूरे गांव
1:44:28
के लिए और इस पर्टिकुलर जो प्रॉब्लम को सॉल्व करने के लिए आपको
1:44:37
कुछ सब्सक्राइब हो तो यह हो गई
1:44:45
दूसरी वाली तो हम
1:44:53
सबसे पहले तो यह कि
1:44:58
वह सब फिर से गायब हो सकते हैं मतलब सच में दिखाई नहीं देंगे इस एक्चुअली पेनल्टी
1:45:04
कि आपके सुसाइड के ऊपर एक पेनल्टी आई हुई कि अब आपकी वेबसाइट के कुछ जो URL से पहले जो है वह सर्च इंजन में नहीं दिखाई देंगे
1:45:11
सच में नहीं जो करें और उनकी रैंकिंग दी है वह अब कभी नहीं होगी यह कुछ URL के साथ भी हो सकता है और कभी-कभी जैसे मैंने आपको
1:45:18
बताया कि मैंने इलेक्शंस काफी स्पीड को हैं तो कभी-कभी यह पूरी की पूरी वेबसाइट के लिए भी हो सकता है कि आपकी वेबसाइट है
1:45:24
वह मेल्ट हो जाए और फिर कभी गूगल के सर्च में वह पियर ना हो पाए तो आपको इस महान व लक्षण से बचकर रहना अब क्या हम लोगों को
1:45:32
तरीके अपनाने चाहिए यह क्या गाइडलाइंस मैंने इलेक्शंस के लिए तो इसके लिए हम लोग यहां पर जो मैंने इलेक्शन रिपोर्ट का
1:45:38
ऑफिशियल डाक्यूमेंटेशन है ज्ञान साल का उसके ऊपर हम लोग जाते हैं तो यहां पर अगर आप देखोगे तो व्हाट इज मैंने इलेक्शन की
1:45:44
बेसिक से डेफिनेशन में लिखे हुए गूगल इशूज अब मैंने इलेक्शन अगेंस्ट साइड में या ह्यूमन रिवर अट ग्लास रॉन्ग बट थे जो 10
1:45:51
चैप्टर नोट कंप्लेंट विद गूगल वेबमास्टर गाइडलाइंस पॉइंट्स तो अगर हम नीचे आए तो आप यहां पर देख सकते हो जो लिस्ट आफ
1:45:59
इनफ्लैक्शंस किस किस टाइप से तो मैंने इलेक्शंस है वह आपकी वेबसाइट ऊपर हो सके से साइट अभी सूट विथ थर्ड पार्टी स्पर्म
1:46:05
user-generated अगर स्पर्म आपकी वेबसाइट के ऊपर है ठीक है बहुत सारे कॉमेंट्स काम वगैरह करें द पार्टिकुलर केस भी आपकी जो
1:46:13
वेबसाइट है मैंने इलेक्शंस के अंदर पहला इस हो सकती है spider-man फ्री होना चाहिए स्ट्रक्चर्ड डाटा में कोई सुनी होना चाहिए
1:46:19
अ नेचुरल लिंक्स आफ की वेबसाइट को नहीं पॉइंट करना चाहिए अब नैचुरल लिंक्स आप अपनी वेबसाईट से दूसरी वेबसाईट को ना दें
1:46:25
तो यह सारे वह जरिए सारे ओरिजंस है जो आपकी रखें के ऊपर मैनुअल एक्शंस को ट्रिगर
1:46:31
कर सकते फाइन बहुत सारे यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं सारी लिस्ट है अब एक बार इस चीज को फॉलो कर लेंगे ठीक तरीके से समझ लेंगे
1:46:38
तो आपको समझ में आ जाएगा कि आपको किन चीजों का ध्यान रखना है वैसे लिए आपको गूगल कि वे मास्टर फॉर लेस है उन्हीं का
1:46:43
ध्यान रखना है जो मैं फीयर चीज आपको यह बताता रहता हूं जिस प्रेमी नहीं करनी है कि नहीं करनी है आपको कोलर को रिसीव करने
1:46:49
की कोशिश नहीं करनी आपको यूजर को ध्यान में रखते आपको कांटेक्ट लिखना पुष्पा इन क्वांटम नहीं लिखना है आपको इस सारी चीज
1:46:55
है जो मैं आपको बताता रहता हूं बस वही सारी चीजें यहां पर भी लिखिए बट आप इस लिस्ट को मैं जरूर कमेंट करूंगा गो थ्रू
1:47:01
कर लीजिएगा थोड़ी सी और आपको क्लेरिटी हो जाएगी उसके बाद अगर मैं बात करता हूं यहां पर सिक्योरिटी इश्यूज कि आप सिक्योरिटीज
1:47:08
उसका क्या मतलब है अगर मैं यहां पर क्लिक करता हूं तो सिक्योरिटी इश्यूज में भी अगर आप देखो तो अभी आपको यहां पर कोई भी चीज
1:47:13
नहीं दिखाई दे रहा है बट सिक्योरिटी यू का मतलब क्या होता है कि जैसे आपकी वेबसाइट के ऊपर कोई विजिटर आता है और Google को
1:47:20
लगता है कि अगर कोई विजिटर आपके वेबसाइट क्यों ऊपर आ रहा है और उसकी सिक्योरिटी हम पर हो रही है तो आपकी वेबसाइट पर
1:47:27
सिक्योरिटी इश्यू लग सकता है मतलब अगर यूजर आपके साइटों पर क्रेडिट कार्ड वगैरह इंफोर्मेशन डाल रहा है और Google को लग
1:47:33
रहा है कि यह वेबसाइट में कुछ मालीशियस चाहिए यह वेबसाइट्स की कार्ड के डिटेल्स को छुड़ाने की कोशिश करिए कुछ भी उसको
1:47:39
मालिश एक्टिविटी लगती थी ऐसा लगता है कि आपकी वेबसाइट ऑलरेडी हार्ड है आपकी वेबसाइट पर कुछ कॉन्टेंट है आपकी व सड़कों
1:47:47
पर कुछ एक स्क्रिप्ट है ठीक है तो जहां पर किसी भी वेबसाइट के अंदर सिक्योरिटी से
1:47:52
रिलेटिड यूजफुल होंगे वहां पर वह वेबसाइट सिक्योरिटी इश्यूज टो सफर करेगी अब जो
1:47:59
सिक्योरिटी बुद्ध है यह क्या होता है कि हमें ध्यान रखना है वह आप यहां पर देख सकते हो जैसे सिक्योरिटी इश्यूज रिपोर्ट
1:48:06
में अगर हम लोग हैं और यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं जैसे पेजेस और साइड इफेक्ट भी सिक्योरिटी इश्यूज कैन अपीयर विद ए
1:48:12
वार्निंग लैंसेज फॉर नाइंथ इंटरेस्ट ईश्वर ने पेइचिंग ब्राउज़र बिना यूजर प्राइस टू
1:48:18
विजिट जेम्स तो आप कभी देखते होंगे कि आप कुछ वेबसाइट को विजिट करने की कोशिश करते हैं जब आप उस वेबसाइट पर विजिट करते हैं
1:48:24
देखते हैं ब्राउज़र आपको कुछ नोटिफिकेशन प्रांप्ट करता है कुछ सिक्योरिटी नोटिफिकेशन प्रांप्ट करता की वेबसाइट ठीक
1:48:30
नहीं इस वेबसाइट पर मत जाओ यहां पर सिक्योरिटी को लेकर इच्छुक है तो ऐसा कुछ प्रॉब्लम है तो जिन वेबसाइट पर सिक्योरिटी
1:48:36
इश्यूज होते हैं वह इस टाइप की जो वार्निंग है वह प्रेस करते हैं ब्राउज़र वगैरह के अंदर पॉइंट तो अगर आप सिक्योरिटी
1:48:42
इश्यूज की बात करें और इससे जिनकी वजह से सिक्योरिटी इश्यूज है तो यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं मालवीय कॉन्टेंट अगर आपकी
1:48:48
वेबसाइट के अंदर मिलता है मतलब हाथ मालवीय कांटेस्ट कोई कोड स्क्रिप्ट इंजेक्टेड मिलती है कोई कांटेक्ट इंजेक्शन होता कोई
1:48:53
वायरल इंफेक्शन होता है डिसेप्टिव ऊपर जैसा है ठीक है उसके बाद डिसेप्टिव है जिसका सीधा सा मतलब यह है कि आप ऐसे पढें
1:49:00
वेबसाइट बना रहे हो जो किसी दूसरे ट्रस्टेड वेबसाइट के रेप्लिका होती जो देखने में बिल्कुल ट्रस्टेड वेबसाइट की
1:49:06
तरीके से लगते हैं बट व्हो टस्टेड वेबसाइट होती है यह ट्रस्टेड पेज सोते नहीं डायरेक्टली डिसेप्टिव पेजेस रिसेप्टिव
1:49:11
एंबेडेड रिसोर्सेज़ ठीक है मिसगाइड करने वाली कोई रिपोर्ट से आपने अपनी वेबसाइट पर अंबेडकर का है अगर आप इसको ओपन करके तो और
1:49:18
भी बहुत सारी चीजें यहां पर देखने को मिलेंगी जो इस पर्टिकुलर रिवीजन से रिलेटेड फाइन जैसे कुछ ऐप डाउनलोड करने के
1:49:26
लिए लोगों को इनक्रीस कर रहे हैं कुछ अनवांटेड सॉफ्टवेयर डाउनलोड करने के लिए उन लोगों को इनक्रीस कर रहा है अनवांटेड
1:49:31
टेंशन लोगों को डाउनलोड करने के लिए इनक्रीस कर है ठीक है तो इस टाइप की चीजें अगर आप करते हैं तो वह सारी चीजें और
1:49:38
इसमें आएंगे सिक्योरिटी इश्यूज महंगी कि यह सारी चीजें एक तरीके से सिक्योरिटी का शो क्रिएट कर रही हो Twitter के लिए तो
1:49:45
उसके लिए आपको पहला इज किया जा सकता है तो आप ज्यादातर कैसेट में देखेंगे कि अगर आप कुछ गड़बड़ी नहीं कर रहें हैं कुछ रिसीव
1:49:52
करने की कोशिश नहीं कर रहे हैं कुछ टाइम इन करने की कोशिश नहीं कर रही है कि रोलर को आप रिसीव करने की कोशिश नहीं कर रहा है
1:49:58
तो ऐसे केस में आपको यहां पर कोई क्वेश्चन गली दिखाई नहीं देंगे आपको जरूर वेबसाइट आपको यहां पर 3 दिखाई नहीं बारे में पता
1:50:04
होना चाहिए कि Google सर्च कंसोल के अंदर इस वाले ऑप्शन का क्या मतलब है फिर से आपको रिक्वेस्ट करता हूं कि आप लोग प्लीज
1:50:10
जो है ना यह वाले जो दोनों डाक्यूमेंटेशन है इनको जरूर आप पढ़ लीजिएगा कोशिश करूंगा इसका लिंक वह डिस्क्रिप्शन में डाल दें
1:50:16
ताकि आपको कोई प्रॉब्लम ना गाइस चाहे तो हम लोग इसको लिंक्स रिपोर्ट
1:50:22
बोलने चाहे तो हम लोग इसको बैकलिंक रिपोर्ट्स बोलने दोनों एक ही चीज हैं तो सबसे पहले हम लोग यह दिखेंगी Google सर्च
1:50:28
कंसोल के अंदर हमें यह रिपोर्ट कहां पर दिखती हैं और इन रिपोर्ट से हमें क्या इनसाइड मिल सकती है जिसके विशेष हम किस
1:50:34
टाइप की जो डिफ्रेंस है वह ले सकते हैं तो यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं जैसे मैं अपने गूगल सर्च कंसोल को ऊपर आता हूं मैं अपनी
1:50:40
किसी प्रॉपर्टी को सलेक्ट करता हूं उसके बाद यहां पर नीचे आपको यह वाला जो सेक्शन दिखाए दिस इज द लिंक का सेक्शन और उसके
1:50:47
बाद आपको कुछ इस टाइप की जो रिपोर्ट है वह यहां पर दिखती है अब एक चीज मैं आपको सेटिंग ही क्लियर कर देना चाहता हूं बहुत
1:50:53
सारे जो एप्स यूज है ना वह इस रिपोर्ट को फॉलो नहीं करते और यहां से वह जो बैकलिंक रिपोर्ट है उसकी बहुत सारा फैमिली कुछ
1:51:00
करते नहीं आपको ऑप्शन जरूर गूगल सर्च कंसोल कर दिया हुआ है बट जो रिसीवर है वह ऑप्शन को यूज नहीं करते हैं अगर उन्हें
1:51:06
अपनी वेबसाइट की बैकलिंक रिपोर्ट की स्टडी करनी होती है उसके एनालिसिस करनी होती है कि जिस पर उन्हें कुछ डिसीजन लेने होते
1:51:14
हैं तो उसके लिए जो बहुत सारे पेड़ टूल्स हैं चाहे हम एक तरफ की बात करने चाहिए हम ऐसे हम रस की बात कर लें यह जो टूल्स यह
1:51:21
आपकी वेबसाइट की जो बैकुंठ प्रोफाइल है उसको बहुत डिटेल में आपको प्रोवाइड करते रहते हैं यह आपके कौन से बैक नहीं जो है
1:51:27
वह ब्रोकन है कितने नए बैकिंग अपने स्क्वायर किए हुए आपकी जैकलीन की वेलोसिटी है वह क्या है आप कितने बॉक्सिंग और एवरेज
1:51:35
डेली बेसिस पर यूज कर रहे हैं तो ऐसी बहुत सारी इनसाइड होती है जो आपको यहां पर नहीं मिलती इसलिए ऐसी यह प्रेफर करते हैं कि वह
1:51:42
काफी डिटेल जो बैकलिंक्स रिपोर्ट है उसकी अनालिसिस कर पाए और बहुत सारे लोग जो है
1:51:48
ना वह कंप्यूटर्स वगैरह की व्याख्या डांस करना चाहते हैं जो कि आप यहां पर नहीं कर सकते तो यह ऑप्शन ए चल जरूर हम यहां पर
1:51:55
दिया हुआ है बट बहुत सारे प्रोडक्ट्स यूज इसको यूज करते नहीं है तो अगर मैं लिंक होली थैंक्यू पर आ जाता हूं तो एक बार हम
1:52:01
यहां पर देख लेते हैं कि इसकी साइड की रिपोर्ट से इन्फॉर्मेशन हम यहां पर देखने को मिलती है मुझे सबसे पहले चीज आप देख सकते हैं यहां पर एक्स्ट्रा लिंग से सीधा
1:52:08
सा मतलब यह है कि दूसरे ऐसे कौन से वेबसाइट से टैब्स पेजेस है जो आपकी वेबसाइट के ऊपर पॉइंट कर रहे हैं वहां पर
1:52:15
आपका जो बैकलिंक है वह बना हुआ है तो अगर मैं टॉप लिंक्ड पेजेस की बात करूं तो कौन सा है हमारे पेजेस है जिनके सबसे ज्यादा
1:52:22
बैक टीम्स दूसरे पेज के ऊपर बने तो आप देख सकते हैं यहां पर सबसे पहले आपको होमपेज दिख रहा होगा और काफी कॉमन भी है ज्यादातर
1:52:30
केस में आप देखोगे भी की बहुत सारे जो बैकलिंक होने या मोहब्बत बैटिंग होते हैं वह हमारे होम पेज के ऊपर ही बनते हैं
1:52:36
पॉइंट और यहां पर आपको एक तो फिर यह कांटेस्ट का पेज है यहां पर हमें एक्सटर्नल लिंक शामिल है वह कितने मिल रहे
1:52:43
15x टनलिंग हम यहां पर मिले अब एक दो चीजें आपको यहां पर समझनी पड़ेगी जो मैं
1:52:48
अभी आपको क्लियर बता देता हूं यहां पर लेट से आपका जो डोमेन है अगर मैं एग्जांपल मान
1:52:53
कर चलो आपका डोमिनेंट है डॉट कॉम पर यहां पर कुछ पेजेस ऐडड 849 एक करके एक पेज है
1:53:00
पीछे गौ हिस लाइफ बट कर के अमेज़न अब पेज
1:53:05
को एक्सटर्नल लिंक्स मिलें यहां पर 80 डॉट कॉम स्लैश ऐसे और c.com लाइफ बट यह दो
1:53:14
व्यक्ति जो किसी वेबसाइट पर उनसे इसको एक्शन रिंग में फाइट यहां पर
1:53:20
अगर से एक चैनल से इस पर लगा होगा इसका एक से मिला और कितने चैनल
1:53:31
चैनल पर अगर केवल इसी को केवल इसी से अगर
1:53:40
इसको चैनल कहने का मतलब ऐसा हो सकता है कि यह यहां पर और यहां पर मिल
1:53:49
ही से मिल रहे हमारी वेबसाइट के किसी भी webpage को तो वहां पर उस पर्टिकुलर के
1:53:56
लिए 12 रिकॉर्ड होगा 2 कप अकाउंट होगा जब एक
1:54:02
ही डोमेन के डिफरेंट डिफरेंट पेजेस से हमें एक पर्टिकुलर पेज के ऊपर एक्सटर्नल
1:54:08
लिंक मिल जाए तब दो बोलेंगे किसको दो एक्सटर्नल लिंक मिले तो यहां पर जो आप रिपोर्ट देख रहे हैं अगर मैं इस रिपोर्ट
1:54:14
की बात करूं द लैंग्वेज counter.com के ऊपर 23next अनवेलिंग्स है तो हो सकता है
1:54:20
इसके एक्सटर्नल लिंक ज्यादा बने हो सकता है कि बहुत सारे पेज उसके ऊपर इस टाइप से
1:54:26
एक्सटर्नल अफेयर्स 14 टनलिंग बने जो इसी को पॉइंट करें तो वहां से केवल एक ही
1:54:32
एक्सटर्नल लिंक अकाउंट होगा तो बहुत सारी रिपोर्ट को गूगल सर्च कंसोल कर लिंक वाले
1:54:37
सेक्शन में कंबाइन कर दिया गया वहीं इस टाइप से बहुत सारी डाटा को कंबाइन करके आपको दिखा देता हूं तो यह चीज आपको पता
1:54:43
होनी चाहिए तो अगर मैं ज्यादा जैसे हम पैरों पर जाकर तो आप देख सकते हो टोटल एक्सटर्नल लिंक्स कितने हैं प्रति है और
1:54:49
टोटल साइट कितनी 1111 साइड से हमें लिंक मिल रहा है तो यहां पर आप देखो तो यह लोपेज समेट रिंग्स
1:54:56
मिले अगर मैं इसको भी ओपन करता हूं तो यह लो है जिसकी कि स्पेस हमें लिंक का पूरा ध्यान से देखोगे ना सारे पिज्जा मैंने सैट
1:55:02
स्लाइस भी ये बीच में स्लैब्स है कि ऐसा नहीं है कि एक ही पेट
1:55:08
से अगर चार लिंक मिल है तो यह दिखाएगा आपको एक ही पेट से आपको चार एक्सटर्नल लिंक मिल रहा है पॉइंट वह आपको दिखाया यह
1:55:14
लिंक मिल रहा है तो इस टाइप की कोई चीज है बिछे चीजें आपको समझ में आनी चाहिए उसके बाद यहां पर इंटरनल लिंक्स की रिपोर्ट अब
1:55:21
इंटरनल इंच का सीधा सा मतलब हुआ कि हमारे जो वेबसाइट के वेबपेजेस है उनको हमारी वेबसाइट के दूसरे पर्दे से जो लिंक मिल
1:55:28
रहा है वह कितने लिंक मिल है यह थोड़ा सा हम लोग को इस टाइप की रिपोर्ट प्रोवाइड करता था कि हम समझ सके हमारे इंटरनल लिंग
1:55:34
की जो स्ट्रैटजी है वह ठीक है या नहीं है जो हमारे मेन पेजेस होते हैं वह प्रॉपरली
1:55:39
इंटरलिंक्ड है या नहीं और यहां पर आप इसको इस वाले पेज कि अगर हम बात करें तो इंटरनल
1:55:44
लिंक्स इसको 11:00 मिले में उसकी बाद हम यहां पर देखिए टॉप लिंकिंग साइट्स किस टाइप के डोमेन से कि साइड की वेबसाइट से
1:55:51
में सबसे ज्यादा लिंग मिले में यहां पर आपको एक्चुअली वेबसाइट का एडमिन है तो वह आपको देखने को मिलता है यहां पर आपको क्या
1:55:58
देखने को मिला लेकिन पेजेस अपने ऊपर हमें लिंक शामिल हैं तो अगर मैं इसको ओपन करता हूं तो कहां से लिंक मिले वह आपको यहां पर
1:56:04
देखने को मिलता है वही चीज एक तरीके से यहां पर भी हो रही देखो आप टॉप लिंकिंग साइड से यहां पर हमें डिफरेंट डिफरेंट वह
1:56:11
वेबसाइट ठीक नहीं है वह डोरमेंट दिखना चाहिए हमें लिंक शामिल हुए हैं उसके बारे में बात करें तो यहां पर टॉप लिंकिंग
1:56:18
टेक्स्ट है टॉप लेकिन टैक्स का सीधा सा मतलब होता है हमारी वेबसाइट को जो बैकलिंक मिल रहा है वह डेफिनेटली किसी ना किसी
1:56:23
अन्य पशु पर होगा तो हम यहां पर यह चेक कर सकते हैं कि जो एनिकट यहां पर यूज हुए है
1:56:29
वह हमारी वेबसाइट के रिलेवेंट है या नहीं है और यहां पर भी हम यहीं चीज चेक करते हैं हमारा जो टो प्रिंट भेजी है वह यह है
1:56:35
और यह इन पार्टिकुलर वेबसाइट से लिंक है मतलब इन टुकड़ों वेबसाइट से लिंक मिला हुआ यहां पर हम चेक कर सकते जो लिंग है जिस भी
1:56:42
हमारे webpage को अपॉइंट कर रहा है उसके रिलेवेंट है भी या नहीं है यह सारी चीजें हम लोग यहां की रिपोर्ट में चेक कर सकते
1:56:48
हैं बट हैं जिसमें आपको बहुत सारे प्रोडक्ट्स यूज इस रिपोर्ट को यूज करते नहीं वह बहुत ही ज्यादा है डिटेल
1:56:53
इंफॉर्मेशन यहां से मिलती नहीं ओवरव्यू टाइप का आपको मिल जाता है एनालिसिस के पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से और बैकलिंक्स रिफेरल यूज
1:57:00
करी थी वहां पर जो हमारे कंप्यूटर के बॉक्स कैनालिस होती वह भी बहुत इंपोर्टेंट रोल प्ले करती है तो क्योंकि वह वाला
1:57:08
पार्ट यहां पर हो नहीं पाता है तो फिर बहुत सारे लोग पेट उसके अंदर जो बैकिंग 47 के सब टूल्स होते ना उनको ज्यादा यूज करना
1:57:15
प्रिफर करते हो तो वह सबसे पहले हम लोग यह देख लेते हैं कि Google सर्च कंट्रोल में कर ऑल स्टेट्स
1:57:22
रिपोर्ट समय कहां पर दिखाई देती हैं उसके बाद देखेंगे कि इन रिपोर्ट्स का मतलब क्या है तो मैं यहां पर जैसे हम लोग गूगल सर्च
1:57:29
कंसोल के ऊपर आते हैं आपको यहां पर आपको जाना है सिंपली सेटिंग्स में और सेटिंग्स में जाने के बाद आपको यहां पर देखिए
1:57:34
कॉलिंग का ऑप्शन दिखेगा और यह वाली जो रिपोर्ट है डिसाइड चली कॉल स्टार्ट रिपोर्ट और यहां पर चौपाई डिफ़ाल्ट डेट
1:57:41
सिलेक्टेड है और लास्ट नॉट बे सिलेक्टेड इस चीज को भी आप ध्यान रखिएगा 1999 में जो
1:57:47
कॉर्ड रिक्वेस्ट हुई है वह लगभग 1090 स्क्रोल रिक्वेस्ट मी हम लोग कर सकेंगे इससे थोड़ी ज्यादा चुड़ैल रिक्वेस्ट है
1:57:54
वहीं अगर मैं इसको ओपन करूंगा तो मुझे यहां पर डिटेल रिपोर्ट दिखाई देगी अब सबसे पहले हम लोग यह समझ कि आखिर कैरल स्टार्ट
1:58:01
रिपोर्ट का मतलब क्या है और मोटा मोटी यह या इन्फॉर्मेशन हमें प्रोवाइड करती है यह रिपोर्ट तो गाइस हम लोग रोलिंग और इंडक्शन
1:58:09
को समझते हैं कि सबसे पहले हमारे वेब पेजेस कि हमारी जो पेज है उनकी पुरानी होती और कॉलिंग होने के बाद हमारे वेब पेज
1:58:15
जो है वह इंडेक्स होते हैं और उसके बाद गूगल के सर्च में हमारे व्यूअर्स दिखाई देते अगर इंडेक्स इन हो तो आपको बताया कि
1:58:22
हमारे webpage है वह गूगल सच में नहीं दिखाई देंगे उस तरीके से कभी गूगल कौन है जिसके बारे में पता ही नहीं चला बट अगर हम
1:58:29
क्रॉलिंग से रिलेटेड टाइट्स को समझना चाहिए स्टार्ट का मतलब होता है numbers
1:58:34
कितने पेजेस की कॉलिंग हुई कितनी कॉल रिक्वेस्ट जो है वह हमारी वेबसाइट के लिए
1:58:40
डोमेन की जो है वह गूगल के कॉलम में रेस करी कितनी कॉलिंग रिक्वेस्ट आई इन सारी
1:58:46
चीजों को इन द फॉर्म ऑफ अगर हम नंबर्स स्टडी करना चाहते हैं तो हमें रोल स्टार्ट
1:58:51
रिपोर्ट की तरफ जाना पड़ता है यह रिपोर्ट हमें यह भी समझने में हेल्प करती है कि
1:58:56
हमारी वेबसाइट को कि रोलर्स किस तरीके से देख रहे हैं बहुत सिंपल सी बातें जितनी ज्यादा कॉलिंग रिक्वेस्ट इतनी अच्छी आपकी
1:59:03
वेबसाइट जितनी ज्यादा वेबसाइट आपकी अपडेटर रहेगी जितनी ज्यादा वेबसाइट आपकी ओपन टू
1:59:08
कॉलिंग रहेगी उतनी ज्यादा कैरल रिक्वेस्ट है वह आपको आपकी वेबसाइट के ऊपर देखने को
1:59:14
मिलेंगे अपॉइंट यहां पर यह भी है कि कितनी जो कि रोल रिक्वेस्ट है वह सक्सेसफुल हो
1:59:19
रही है क्योंकि अगर रोलर आपकी वेबसाइट के ऊपर आ रहा है और वेबसाइट के पेजेस को कॉल
1:59:25
करने की कोशिश कर रहा है और मान लेते हैं कुछ पेजेस में कोई भी टेक्निकल शुरू हो सकता है कोई भी रीज़न हो सकता है जिसकी
1:59:31
वजह से ठुकराल नहीं कर पा रहा है तो यह एक नेगेटिव पॉइंट है तो यह सारी चीजें अगर इन
1:59:36
फॉर्म आफ नंबर्स हमें स्टडी करनी है तो हम सीधे पहुंच जाते हैं कि रोल स्टार्ट रिपोर्ट्स ऊपर वहीं पॉइंट मैंने यहां पर
1:59:43
लिखा हुआ है कि टेल्स यू अबाउट द कॉलिंग हिस्ट्री आफ योर वेबसाइट आपकी पिछली चक्कर
1:59:48
ऑल इन हिस्ट्री है उसके बारे में पूरी इंफॉर्मेशन आपको पता चलती है एक और बहुत इंपोर्टेंट पॉइंट घी यह जो स्टार्ट की
1:59:55
रिपोर्ट है यह छोटी वेबसाइट के लिए उतनी यूज कर लेंगे जो बड़ी वेबसाइट पर पर लाखों
2:00:01
पेजेस होते हैं वहां पर आपको चीज के ऊपर नजर रखनी होती है कि मेरे इतने सारे पेज है अब इसके प्रपोर्शन में जो कॉलिंग
2:00:08
रिक्वेस्ट जनरेट हो रही है वह कितनी जनरेट हो रही है कितनी कॉलिंग रिक्वेस्ट फेल हो रही है इन सारी चीजों का आपको ध्यान रखना
2:00:14
होता है तो छोटी वेबसाइट होती उन्हें बहुत ज्यादा प्रॉब्लम होती नहीं है मैं तो कुल बजट का इशू होता है वहां पर जो कर ऑल
2:00:21
स्टेट्स है वह जनरली पॉजिटिव रहते क्योंकि आप के सभी पैजेस ना ठीक तरीके से रोल को
2:00:26
जाते हैं वहां पर पॉइंट तो अगर हम लोग ब्रॉल स्टार्स के ऊपर आ जाएं तो यहां पर आपको सबसे पहले जो 90s का टाइम प्लेट है
2:00:33
उसके अकॉर्डिंग आप रिपोर्ट आपको देखने को मिल रही है और जो लास्ट अपडेटेड है वह सेटिंग्स अप्रैल है ठीक है अगर हम यहां पर
2:00:40
देखिए तो आपको टोटल रिक्वेस्ट चोर नाइनटी डेज में गूगल कोलर की जनरेट हुई है वह
2:00:45
यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं तो लगभग 1000 रोल रिक्वेस्ट यहां पर जनरेट में फाइट जुकाम रिक्वेस्ट जेनरेटर होंगी तो जो पेज हमारा
2:00:52
लोड होगा फाइन उससे कुछ रिसोर्सेज़ वगैरह भी जो Google है वह डाउनलोड करेगा तो इतने
2:00:57
साइज की जो रिसोर्सेज वह डाउनलोड मैं तुम्हारा पेज लोड होगा तो पेज लोड होने का जो एवरेज और रिस्पांस टाइम है वह कितना वह
2:01:06
यहां पर आपको दिख रहा है ठीक है कि अब रिस्पांस टाइम हमारा कितना यह सारी चीजें अभी हम लोग को यहां पर सारी चीजें जो है
2:01:12
वह ठीक दिख रही है अगर मैं नहीं चाहता हूं यहां पर टोह स्टेटस आपको दिखाते हुए स्टेटस में अगर यहां पर मेरा शब्दों में
2:01:18
वगैरह होता तो वह यहां पर हमें दिखता बट पोस्ट स्टेटस के हिसाब से क्या प्रॉब्लम है आई हॉप स्टेटस का मतलब सीधा से यहां पर
2:01:25
आप समझो कि हमारी वेबसाइट पर पेट्रोलिंग करते वक्त क्या इशू जाए पिछले नोएडा में
2:01:31
उसकी रिपोर्ट आपको यहां पर देखने को मिलेगी तो आपने यहां पर इसे रोबोट का टेक्स्ट फाइल को सच करने में से कोई भी
2:01:37
प्रॉब्लम नहीं हुई आप देख रहे हैं यह टिक दिखा रहा है ठीक है तो अगर कुछ पल कुआं भी है किसी कंडीशन में तो आप यहां पर देख
2:01:44
सकते हैं नाइटफाल व्हाट्सएप टेबल फेवरेट अगर फिर हुआ भी है तो आप डबल है कोई
2:01:50
दिक्कत की बात नहीं तो यह वाली चीज ठीक है उसके बाद डी एन ए रिवॉल्यूशन में भी एक्सेप्टेबल फेवरेट है कोई दिक्कत की बात
2:01:56
नहीं सब कुछ ठीक है और यहां पर आपको सरवर कनेक्टिव के सर्वर कनेक्टिविटी जो है मतलब
2:02:01
रिक्वेस्ट रेस होती है और आपकी पोस्टिंग से जो रिस्पोंस जाता है उसमें कुछ इशूज
2:02:06
रहे हैं और यहां पर आप देखो जो इश्यूज थे वह पार्ट में पहले काफी हाई थे बट अभी जो
2:02:13
फेवरेट है वह एक्सेप्टेबल तो अगर मैं इस रिपोर्ट को ओपन करूंगा तो आप यहां पर
2:02:18
देखोगे यह वाला जो आप देख रहे हो फेवरेट ठीक है यहां पर फ्रेंड रिक्वेस्ट बहुत
2:02:25
ज्यादा है ठीक है अगर मैं यहां पर देखूं जो अभी का टाइम में मार्च और अप्रैल का जो
2:02:30
टाइम है उसमें खराब देखो तो फोल्ड कर ऑल रिक्वेस्ट जो है वह कम है तो अगर आपकी जो
2:02:35
कि रोल रिक्वेस्ट फील्ड रोल रिक्वेस्ट है अगर वह आपकी रिक्वेस्ट इनक्रीज हो रही है फील्ड कॉल रेट की बेक अच्छा सिग्नल मतलब
2:02:42
और आपकी वेबसाइट को स्क्रोल करना चाहता है और टेक्निकल इश्यूज की वजह से या किसी भी चीज की वजह से वह आपकी उस साइड को कॉल
2:02:49
नहीं कर पाता तो धीरे-धीरे क्या होगा वह यहां पर जो आपके सामने टोटल रिक्वेस्टेड करेंगे ना इनका नंबर
2:02:56
शुद्ध धीरे-धीरे कम करता जाएगा जिससे लगेगा कि आपके पेड़ अगर बहुत सारे चेंजेस होते हैं आप वेबसाइट अपडेट नहीं रहती आपके
2:03:04
फैट टेक्निकल इश्यूज रहते हैं तो धीरे-धीरे आपके रिक्वेस्ट है उसको कम करना है वहीं पर अगर आप अपडेटेड रहती हैं
2:03:11
तो धीरे-धीरे आपके रिक्वेस्ट है कि मेघनाद की वेबसाइट जितना बेहतर रिस्पांस
2:03:19
घी उसने बेहतर आपको यहां पर नंबर देखने को मिलेनगे
2:03:25
subscribe अगर मैं यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं कि
2:03:33
रिक्वेस्ट घ्र ओके का मतलब कि उन पर सबस्क्राइब
2:03:41
रिक्वेस्ट जिन्होंने 0 से
2:03:47
सब्सक्राइब वह
2:03:53
मोडिफाइड को यहां पर यह रिक्वेस्ट चाहेंगे
2:03:58
कि वह चीज इसके ऊपर जो है ना वह रोलिंग हो यह नोट फ्रंट वाले पर इसके ऊपर जो करौली
2:04:04
हो तो इसलिए आपको रोलर की जो रिसोर्सेस है उनको बेचकर हो तो यह नंबर जितने कम होंगे जो नोन इंपॉर्टेंट पेजेस है जो दहेज़ का
2:04:12
रिस्पांस नहीं दे रहे हैं उनके ऊपर जितनी भी कॉलिंग कम होगी उतना बेहतर है उतने बेहतर तरीके से आपका जो कि रोल बचत है वह
2:04:19
टमाटर होता है उतना बेहतर टेक्निकली गूगल की नजर में आपकी वेबसाइट रहती है उसी तरीके से बाइक फाइल पाथ आपको
2:04:26
यहां पर पता चल रहा है कि रोल रिक्वेस्ट बाय फाइल टाइप्स आफ वेस्ट ईमेल सीएसएस जावास्क्रिप्ट को सबसे ज्यादा ही देखने को
2:04:32
मिलेंगी उसके बाद बाइक पंक्चर अगर आप देखो तो पहला यहां पर रिफ्रेश चंद सेकेंड
2:04:38
डिस्कवरी दुगरी फर्श का मतलब होता है कि फ्रांस रिक्वेस्ट उन्हें इसके ऊपर आई जो
2:04:44
पेजेस ऑलरेडी एक्जिस्ट करते थे ताकि अच्छी तरह स्क्रोल रिक्वेस्ट आप जैसे मेरी
2:04:50
वेबसाइट पर एक पेज ऑलरेडी और वह पहले से इंटैक्ट हो चुका है वह पहले से सब्सक्राइब
2:04:57
कर चुका है अपनी वेबसाइट पर दोबारा तो फिर से उसको कॉल करेगा तो डेट विल कम इनटू थ्री
2:05:04
फ्रेंड्स अगर आप देखो तो हमारे जितने भी पेजेस के ऊपर क्लिक करें जनरेट हुई है वह ऑलरेडी एक्जिस्टिंग पेजेस थे नए जो पहले
2:05:11
से बहुत कम थे डिस्कवरी का मतलब नए डिस्टिक है और कौन से गूगलबोट के थ्रू डुब
2:05:17
रिक्वेस्ट है कि रॉलिंग रिक्वेस्ट को जनरेट वह यहां पर देख सकते हो तो बेसिकली आपकी कॉलिंग से रिलेटेड जो नंबर होते हैं
2:05:24
कि कल रिक्वेस्ट वगैरह कितनी जनरेट हुई वह धीरे-धीरे ट्रॉली कॉस्ट बढ़ रही या घट रही
2:05:30
है यह सारे इंडिकेशंस आपको यहां से मिला कि अगर घटना यह ट्रॉली कुशवाहा गुड सिगरेट अगर बढ़ रही है कल्पवृक्ष के साथ गुड
2:05:37
थिंग्स बट जैसे मैंने आपको बताया कि यह इनसाइड अगर बहुत बड़ी वेबसाइट है तब तो
2:05:42
उसके लिए जरूरी है अगर बहुत बड़ी वेबसाइट नहीं है तो उस पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से इतनी जरूरी इनसाइड से है नहीं अगर आप इसको
2:05:48
इग्नोर कर दोगे तो कोई भी प्रॉब्लम होगी बट नई चीज सीखने में कोई प्रॉब्लम भी नहीं दूसरा लगा हूं वीडियो पसंद आया होगा इस
2:05:54

when it comes to SEO literally the most
0:02
powerful free tool is Google search
0:04
console and I get asked questions every
0:07
single day about how to use it so in
0:08
this video I'm going to be walking you
0:10
through how to use Google search console
0:13
and the key areas that I feel you should
0:15
be focusing on in order to help you make
0:17
decisions when it comes to SEO so
0:19
getting straight into it Google search
0:21
console is essentially Google's native
0:23
platform that allows you to first of all
0:26
tell Google that you're ready to show up
0:28
on search engines it's also way you'll
0:30
see all of the data around how you're
0:32
ranking on Google where you're getting
0:34
clicks from how your pages are doing etc
0:36
etc so as you can see here this is a
The Dashboard
0:39
dashboard you get an overview of your
0:40
performance so how many clicks you're
0:42
getting then it shows indexing and
0:44
indexing basically means whether you're
0:46
indexed or not and index just means
0:48
you're showing up on search engines so
0:51
79 index Pages means that on this
0:53
website my travel blog 79 of the pages
0:56
are showing up on Google a 94 not index
0:59
just means that 94 of the pages on the
1:02
website are not showing up on search
1:04
engines which is something that will'll
1:05
be touching upon in a second then going
1:07
down to experience this basically shows
1:10
if you've got any pages that have bad
1:12
core web vitals which is basically page
1:14
loading speed so if you've got any Pages
1:17
which load really poorly they're going
1:19
to show here you can see that I've got
1:21
66 poor Pages for mobile and then an
1:24
enhancements will basically tell us if
1:26
we've got any invalid schema on the
1:29
website and schema is just a type of
1:31
language basically going down a little
1:32
bit further before I show you the
Submitting your Sitemap
1:34
details probably the first thing that I
1:36
actually want you to do once you've set
1:38
up Google search console is head over to
1:40
sit maps and sit Maps is basically where
1:42
you can submit your sitap to Google and
1:45
S map is basically a map of all the
1:48
pages on your website and it essentially
1:50
is a map that allows Google to see what
1:52
pages you have so that you can show up
1:54
properly on search engines so before we
1:56
get started I want you to make sure that
1:58
you submit this sitap to Google Now
2:01
depending upon the website builder you
2:03
use it's going to be a little bit
2:04
different for Squarespace all you have
2:06
to do is type in sitemap.xml if you got
2:09
WordPress it'll be a little bit
2:10
different just Google for the website
2:12
builder you run how to submit sitemap to
2:15
Google search console it's just super
2:17
super easy but this again is going to
2:19
tell Google that you're ready to be
2:20
displayed so then just moving over to
URL Inspection & Testing
2:23
URL inspection this essentially just
2:25
allows you to put any web page of the
2:28
website that you've selected in this
2:29
search bar and when you inspect it
2:32
Google search console is going to tell
2:34
you whether or not the page that you've
2:36
entered is on Google or not if it's not
2:38
on Google you can press request indexing
2:41
which will essentially tell Google hey
2:43
please manually go through this web page
2:45
and display on search engines now we're
2:47
just going to cancel now cuz this web
2:49
page is already indexed URL inspection
2:51
is super important because if you've got
2:53
pages that always here you're not able
2:55
to get it to index what I want you to do
2:58
is head over to here inspect it in the
3:00
search bar and then press test live URL
3:03
and just like our request indexing
3:05
actually gets Google to go through the
3:07
page and display on search engines what
3:09
testing the live URL does it gets
3:12
Google's own tool that decides whether
3:14
websites index or not to go through the
3:16
URL and see if there's anything wrong
3:18
that is stopping it from being indexed
3:20
so this is super important because often
3:22
you've probably got pages on your
3:23
website which aren't indexing and it's
3:25
really really frustrating but if you go
3:27
through this and you test the URL you're
3:29
going to learn what is holding it back
3:31
and in this case you can see URL is
3:33
available to Google and if your web page
3:35
wasn't available to Google or there was
3:37
a problem this would be read and it
3:39
would tell you what is wrong so again
3:41
super super helpful so if you are having
3:43
any problems head over to that so you
3:45
know how to submit your s map you know
3:47
how to inspect your URL and the
3:49
different options available to you I'm
Search Results Data
3:50
now going to take you over to search
3:52
results and search results I mentioned
3:54
earlier that Google search console has
3:55
all the data essentially what search
3:57
results does it shows you how many
3:59
clicks you're getting in any given
4:01
period shows you how many Impressions
4:03
you're getting which is when someone
4:04
sees you on search results but doesn't
4:06
click on you it gives you your average
4:08
click free rate so the percentage
4:10
likelihood if someone sees you they're
4:12
likely to click on you and then finally
4:13
the average position so on average where
4:16
do you rank on Google for any periods
4:18
you can either filter it down to the
4:19
search term the page the country Etc
4:22
super super powerful and when we scroll
4:24
down we're actually then able to see so
4:26
this is for the past 3 months this
4:28
website has got 41 6,000 clicks I'm then
4:31
able to go down and see which Search
4:33
terms I've actually got these clicks for
4:36
so this is my travel blog you can see
4:38
here that in the past 3 months we've got
4:41
783 clicks for the search term how to
4:43
chat for your crush I can even go here
4:45
and click average position and you can
4:47
see there it's showing us that the
4:48
average position for this search term is
4:50
number two so if I just go over to
4:52
Google you can see here that we actually
4:54
positioned one here so obviously it is
4:56
an average position and you can see here
4:58
this is actually a little widget as a as
4:59
long as you're logged into the account
5:01
on Google that you have access to the
5:03
Google search console you're actually
5:04
going to see this widget and when we'
5:05
seen the last s days it actually says
5:07
that we're on average position one so
5:10
obviously we last three months here so
5:11
it's a little bit off because obviously
5:13
it's more historical data but when we
5:15
scroll down we can actually see all the
5:17
other queries that we're actually
5:18
getting searches for which again is
5:20
super super powerful cuz we can filter
5:22
by clicks Impressions position which
5:25
allows us to get an extra level of data
5:27
and understanding when it comes to our
5:29
web weite even able to go through pages
5:31
so we can see which are the best
5:33
performing pages on the website we can
5:35
go to countries devices Etc this is
5:37
going to give you the complete
5:39
understanding of how your website is
5:41
ranking on Google and just before I take
Comparing Ranking Data Over Time
5:43
you to the next sections on Google
5:45
search console I'm going to show you
5:47
probably what is one of the most
5:48
powerful areas when it actually comes to
5:51
understanding how your website is
5:52
ranking over time and if you need to do
5:54
anything in order to improve your
5:56
website and that is actually the
5:58
comparison feature so we're going to
5:59
we're going to go over to date here and
6:01
then we're going to go to compare and
6:02
when I click compare what it's going to
6:03
allow me to do is compare any periods to
6:06
the previous period so for example if we
6:08
go to the last 6 month if we go to the
6:10
last three months compared to the
6:11
previous period and then press apply
6:13
it's going to automatically compare the
6:15
last three months to the previous three
6:17
months so again what that allows us to
6:18
do is compare how we're doing over time
6:21
to see how our SEO efforts are
6:23
performing this is also super important
6:25
because obviously Google's algorithms
6:27
are constantly changing and what this
6:29
actually allows you to do is allows you
6:31
to see on a search term by search term
6:33
basis how you're changing and a page by
6:35
Page basis so if for some reason you
6:37
notice that your clicks are down on a
6:39
given month you're able to come here
6:41
compared to the previous month or
6:42
compared to the previous period and see
6:44
exactly what is going on so for example
6:46
when I scroll down here I can actually
6:48
see all of the Search terms the Clicks
6:50
in the past three months The Impressions
6:52
in the past three months and then the
6:54
previous period And when I click to
6:56
clicks difference what it actually shows
6:58
me now is the different in clicks that
7:01
I've got in the past 3 months in this
7:03
case to the previous 3 months which
7:05
again is super important because it
7:07
allows me to understand how my website
7:09
is changing on search engines now I
7:12
actually have an extension installed
7:13
called keywords everywhere and that's
7:16
actually why I'm getting this data here
7:17
around how many Search terms these
7:20
search queries get per month and
7:21
actually quite interesting to this and
7:23
the reason wide recommend installing it
7:25
it's literally $10 a month you can see
7:26
here that I've lost 134 clicks in the
7:29
past three months compared to the
7:31
previous three months for the search
7:32
term how to chat with your crush now of
7:34
course it is a travel blog don't judge
7:36
me here but actually I can see that over
7:38
this period the search term has actually
7:40
reduced so again this gives me an
7:42
understanding I may or may not have lost
7:44
search engine rankings for this the tell
7:46
I can just go to average position and I
7:48
can actually see whether the search
7:50
engine position has changed which
7:52
actually I've increased search engine
7:54
position in the past three months but
7:55
the reason why I've actually lost clicks
7:57
is actually because the trend of the
7:59
amount of people searching for this term
8:02
has reduced over time so again this
8:04
allows us to get a really good
8:06
understanding by a search term on a
8:07
search term by search term basis so
8:10
again just allow us to understand what
8:11
exactly is going on and because we can
8:13
do it for Search terms we can actually
8:15
do it for Pages as well so again I'm
8:17
still on compare here so I'm comparing
8:19
the last 3 months to the previous three
8:21
months I can filter it by clicks
8:23
difference and as you can see here I've
Analysing Rank Drops/Lossed Traffic
8:25
actually can see that this page in the
8:27
past 3 months has lost 2 6,000 clicks
8:30
which is a significant number of clicks
8:32
don't get me wrong and what Google
8:33
search console is actually going to
8:35
allow us to do is figure out why we have
8:37
lost search engine rankings because
8:40
actually as you can see here my average
8:42
position has actually got better I've
8:44
gone from an average of 7.9 to 7.3 so
8:47
again I'm wondering well why have lost
8:48
clicks then if I've actually gone up on
8:50
search engine rankings my position has
8:52
improved why have lost clicks and one of
8:54
the really neat features that I like in
8:56
Google search console if you actually
8:58
click on the page it even works on a
9:00
query if you click a query or you click
9:02
a page it's going to filter the results
9:04
that you see on this web page by the
9:07
page or query that you've selected so
9:09
because I filtered it down to that page
9:11
that I was just hovering over what I'm
9:12
able to see is a graph of the clicks
9:15
Impressions average position for this
9:17
page and again what's really neat if I
9:19
head over to query is what I'm then able
9:21
to see is the Search terms that this
9:23
page ranks for and how it has changed
9:26
over time so if you have a page that for
9:28
some reason is getting less clicks what
9:30
you're able to do is go over here and
9:32
filter down that page so you can see
9:35
exactly the Search terms and how theyve
9:37
changed over time which again is going
9:39
to get you an understanding you know has
9:40
your search engine rankings changed
9:42
using keywords everywhere you're also
9:44
able to see if it's just down to
9:46
changing search behavior on search
9:48
engines you're able to see if you know
9:50
positions have changed whatever it is
9:52
you're able to diagnose it you're able
9:53
to look into the data and because you're
9:55
able to do this on a page by Page basis
9:57
you're also able to do this on a query
10:00
by query basis so right now we filtered
10:02
by Page what I can actually do now is
10:05
filter by clicks so what I'm going to do
10:08
I'm actually going to go to the highest
10:10
performing click that I have how to chat
10:11
with your crush and click on this and
10:13
what this is going to show me is going
10:14
to show me how this search query has
10:17
been performing over the past however
10:19
long and again because I'm comparing I
10:21
can see that this has actually reduced
10:23
in the past 3 months compared to the
10:25
previous period and then when I go over
10:26
to Pages I'm able to see what pages is
10:29
on Google am I getting clicks and
10:31
impressions for this search term which
10:33
again is super super powerful because
10:35
when I actually remove compare and go
10:38
just to filter I'm able to see all of
10:40
the pages for this search term that is
10:42
getting clicks and Impressions and
Detecting Keyword Cannibalization
10:44
that's actually the next thing that I'm
10:46
going to move over to with Google search
10:48
console cuz it allows you to see if
10:49
you've got keyword cannibalization and
10:52
keyword cannibalization is when you have
10:54
two or more pages competing for the same
10:56
search term cuz we're able to filter
10:58
your website down to a specific search
11:01
term and go over to Pages it's going to
11:03
allow you to see if you've got two or
11:04
more pages on your website that are
11:06
getting clicks or a significant number
11:08
of impressions for the same search term
11:11
now obviously I've filtered it down to
11:13
how to chat with your crush and I go
11:14
across the here I can see that there's a
11:16
couple of other Pages getting
11:17
impressions for this search term however
11:20
it's in comparison to this there's no
11:22
clicks and it's very little Impressions
11:24
so I don't have keyword cannibalization
11:26
for this specific search term which
11:28
again gives me peace of mind mind and
11:29
because this tool has data coming
11:31
directly from Google what it allows me
11:33
to do as I've already mentioned sorry
11:35
for banging the drum it essentially
11:36
gives me confidence and know that I'm
11:38
doing the right thing and gives me the
11:40
data in order to inform the strategy
11:42
that I'm applying so now we've covered
Pages Tab: Non-Indexed Pages
11:44
search results what I'm now going to do
11:46
is go over to pages and we're going to
11:48
get a little bit more technical now so
11:50
please bear with me what this is
11:51
actually going to do you remember we
11:53
mentioned earlier about not index Pages
11:56
what this is going to do it's actually
11:57
going to allow us to figure out why
12:00
certain pages aren't indexed so for
12:02
example here this breaks down why all
12:03
the pages aren't indexed and it shows
12:05
you Page by Page the reason so for
12:08
example cwed currently not indexed means
12:11
that Google has crued the pages but it's
12:13
decided not to index it so you can see
12:15
here's a couple of blogs here which for
12:17
some reason haven't been indexed this
12:19
doesn't really look like a page and this
12:21
looks like a test page so I should
12:22
probably just go in and delete it going
12:24
back to page indexing you can see a
12:26
number of different reasons and to be
12:27
honest I'm not going to go through
12:29
Reason by reason for why these aren't
12:31
index when you do this for yourself and
12:33
you go over all you really need to do is
12:35
go over to Google copy the reason and
12:37
you're going to see a website on Google
12:39
that's going to explain exactly what
12:41
that reason is so and to be honest a lot
12:43
of the time you don't really need to
12:44
worry for example this is just an issue
12:46
with Squarespace is actually quite
12:48
common that isn't going to be holding
12:49
you back things like not found though
12:51
are definitely something you need to
12:52
look into cuz this essentially means
12:54
that there's a broken link and what I
12:55
would need to do in this case I would
12:57
need to create a 301 redirect from this
13:00
page to the proper page in this example
13:02
I just know that I changed the URL to
13:04
remove the 2022 cuz it updated it to a
13:07
2024 guide so what this allows you to do
13:09
is essentially pick up things that you
13:11
might have done wrong this is something
13:12
in my case that I just didn't add a 301
13:15
redirect or essentially things that you
13:16
need to do in order to get more pages
13:19
shown up on Google as well as obviously
13:21
all the data that I've already shown you
13:22
so now we've gone through pages and
Page Removals
13:24
indexing what I'm now going to take you
13:26
through is removals and removals is is
13:29
essentially a place where you can tell
13:31
Google to remove certain pages from
13:33
search engines now of course there's
13:35
many different ways that you might want
13:36
to do this this for example is a
13:38
temporary removal so if you want to
13:40
urgently remove a page from Google
13:42
search so for example maybe you
13:44
accidentally published a page it's now
13:46
showing on Google and you want to
13:47
quickly remove it but you don't want to
13:49
do it permanently this temporary removal
13:51
page allows you to do exactly that you
13:53
just press new request it's going to
13:55
take you over to this and it allows you
13:57
to temporarily remove the URL you can
14:00
also go through and do outdated content
14:02
so let's say for example you've got
14:03
outdated content that you've now updated
14:06
and you want to remove that outdated
14:07
content let's say for example you had a
14:09
terms of conditions for 2023 and you've
14:12
now got your 2024 version you could go
14:14
through to here and you could submit
14:16
outdated content that you want to be
14:18
removed so again this is probably a page
14:20
that you're probably not going to use
14:22
unless you really need it however when
14:24
you do need it you now know exactly
14:26
where to come to then we're just going
Experience Tab
14:27
to go over to the experience section
14:29
we're going to go through this a little
14:30
bit quicker but this essentially tells
14:32
you whether you have pages that need
14:35
Improvement for core web V tool so
14:37
mobile so essentially page speed and all
14:39
I need to do is click here and this is
14:41
going to show me all the pages on my
14:43
website which aren't considered good I.E
14:46
need to be improved when it comes to cor
14:47
web vitals which is basically just
14:49
Google's page speed and again just like
14:51
the pages up here all I need to do is
14:54
click on the reason that's showing up
14:55
and again if you don't understand what
14:57
this means all I recommend is you just
14:59
just go over to Google copy it in and
15:01
it's going to tell you in fact here
15:02
you've even got an article from Google
15:04
telling you how to resolve this so again
15:06
this is just super helpful when it comes
15:08
to actually figuring out if you've got
15:10
any Pages which need to be sped up I've
15:11
got bad page speed experience and in
15:14
particular here you want to focus on
15:15
mobile because Google has actually
15:17
increased the importance when it comes
15:19
to mobile page performance so definitely
15:22
head over to mobile here and see if
15:24
there's anything you need to improve on
15:25
and again cool web vitals and https are
15:28
just sections of this main page now what
Manual Actions
15:31
I'm going to do I'm now just going to go
15:32
over to manual actions this is if
15:35
basically if Google ever detects a
15:37
problem with your website if you get
15:38
penalized if you bought spammy back
15:40
links you're going to see it come up if
15:42
you ever have any security issues it's
15:44
going to come up and then the final area
Links Tab
15:46
that I'm going to go into is actually
15:48
the links section here and this is
15:50
actually a really underutilized area of
15:53
Google search console and what allows
15:55
you to do is get an understanding of all
15:57
the links that you have coming to your
15:59
website so you don't need to use a tool
16:01
like ah refs to see the back links that
16:03
you have it also allows you to get an
16:05
understanding of the internal linking
16:07
structure on your website so yeah a lot
16:09
of people that I speak to don't actually
16:11
know that you don't need to pay for a
16:13
tool in order to see the back links that
16:14
you have and you can actually get a
16:16
really good understanding of the
16:17
internal links on your website through
16:19
this tool for example here I can see the
16:21
top link pages so I can go here and I
16:24
can actually see all the top pages on my
16:27
website that have backlinks going to
16:29
them so for example I can go over to my
16:31
homepage click on this and this shows me
16:33
all the sites that have links through to
16:36
this website so for example I can see
16:38
that the substat there's different pages
16:40
which link through to my homepage
16:42
there's even the Daily Mail For example
16:43
because my travel blog got featured in
16:45
The Daily Mail going back to the main
16:47
Links Page you can see here that this
16:49
shows me the top pages that have
16:51
internal links going to them so this
16:53
basically shows me that I have 85
16:56
internal links from pages on my website
16:58
to the this page and again it just
17:00
allows us to get a really good
17:01
understanding because this is important
17:03
when it comes to page hierarchy it's
17:05
super important that when you go through
17:07
your website you have your most
17:09
important pages that have a lot of
17:11
internal links going to them because
17:12
when Google goes through this it's going
17:13
to look at these pages that have the
17:15
most internal links and assume that
17:17
you've linked to them because those are
17:18
important pages on your website it's one
17:21
of the reasons that often on Google
17:23
search engines for example if I type in
17:25
SEO space it's one of the reasons that
17:27
these pages will go up in Google search
17:30
engine results because these are the
17:32
pages that have the most internal links
17:34
going to them on your website so if some
17:37
reason you're getting frustrated that
17:38
you're not getting these Pages show up
17:40
under the main homepage on your website
17:43
is probably because you don't have
17:44
enough internal links going to them and
17:46
if you want to see how many internal
17:47
links you have going to them you just
17:49
got to go over to Links internal links
17:51
and see your topped link pages and again
17:54
that's going to allow you to come up
17:55
with an action plan in order to solve
17:57
the issue with your website and then
17:59
just scrolling down just to finish up
18:00
can see here this is top linking text so
18:03
this essentially is going to see you the
18:05
anchor text so for example when you link
18:07
from a web page to one website or
18:09
another web page the link text is the
18:11
anchor text and the anchor text is super
18:13
important because Google looks at that
18:15
as an indicator of what you should rank
18:17
for so for example if my blog wants to
18:19
rank for couple's travel blog and I have
18:22
back links and internal links that go to
18:24
my homepage page that I want to rank for
18:26
that that have the exact keyword couple
18:28
travel blog or variations that's going
18:31
to be an indicator to Google that I
18:33
should rank for that keyword and again
18:35
what becomes super powerful when I go
18:37
over to links I can see my top linking
18:39
text this just allows you to see the top
18:41
linking text to your different pages so
Conclusion
18:45
there you are guys that is a complete
18:46
run through of Google search console of
18:49
course if you have any questions feel
18:50
free to leave it in the comments
18:52
hopefully this is giving you a really
18:53
good understanding of the main different
18:55
pages that you need to go to there are
18:57
some areas that I haven't on to such as
18:59
settings for example here you can
19:01
actually see if you want really want to
19:03
get nerdy how often Google is going for
19:06
your website but to be honest most
19:08
people really don't need to understand
19:10
this so I'm going to leave that for
19:11
another video or someone more technical
19:13
than me to go through it but thanks a
19:14
lot guys for watching to this video if
19:16

19:23
results and hopefully I'll see you in

Google search console for beginners for
0:04
2025 this is a mini course by
0:09
rankia in this video session I'll show
0:12
you the most important parts of using
0:15
Google search
0:17
console I will not cover how to add and
0:20
verify your website because I've already
0:23
created tutorials on rank your YouTube
0:25
channel and rank your website as well so
0:29
let's let's dive right into it let's
0:32
look at the first thing that you should
0:34
focus on which are your sit
0:37
Maps sit Maps when you submit a Sit map
0:40
to
0:41
Google you're basically saying to Google
0:44
search engine you know what here's the
0:47
map of my
0:50
website most people make an honest
0:52
mistake by submitting one parent s map
0:57
don't do that instead ask ask yourself
1:00
this very important question and that is
1:04
what is original on your
1:06
website that you want Google to
1:10
index and rank
1:13
four in my example I've got blog posts
1:16
perhaps some
1:18
pages but I should not submit a category
1:22
sitemap because there's nothing unique
1:24
on these
1:26
categories we're looking at a typical
1:28
WordPress site using using Y SEO
1:32
plugin sitemap
1:35
functionality if you're using Shopify or
1:38
different content Management
1:39
Systems then you can create sit Maps
1:44
accordingly as I've said focus on
1:46
content that you want Google to rank
1:50
content that is
1:53
original or else you'll be wasting a lot
1:55
of time looking at un important data in
1:59
Google SE console you can
2:03
always press on the site
2:06
map you can open the site map or you can
2:10
actually remove the site map I'll
2:13
actually do that right now actually I
2:16
won't do it but if I do that's no
2:18
problem when should you resubmit because
2:22
you can do
2:23
that if your website has seen major
2:28
changes perhaps you update your theme
2:31
you've published new original content
2:34
let's say 10 different URLs or 50
2:37
different
2:39
URLs or something major has changed on
2:42
your website then you can remove the
2:44
sitemap and resubmit saying you know
2:47
what here's the new map of my
2:52
website so then we
2:56
have let's take a look search result
3:00
results the performance results we've
3:04
got average
3:05
position average CTR total Impressions
3:08
all this stuff now I won't bore you with
3:12
all these basically as your website
3:15
grows and you target keywords
3:17
accordingly to your industry then you'll
3:21
see results
3:23
here and the way to utilize this
3:27
is let's imagine search queries here you
3:30
can see what people are searching and
3:32
finding your website for and when you
3:35
select the average position you can see
3:39
you can press on the position and ask
3:42
yourself okay you know what what is
3:44
lingering on the third or fourth or
3:47
fifth
3:49
position and then you're getting lots of
3:53
Impressions but not enough clicks then
3:56
you can focus on those type of keywords
4:00
so then you can create perhaps better
4:03
content let's
4:05
imagine let's imagine this scenario
4:08
let's go
4:09
back let's imagine IM is longer than 200
4:12
milliseconds I can see there's some
4:16
results
4:18
but okay I'm still ranking High that's
4:22
okay let's look at
4:24
Impressions here I can see delete my
4:28
activity
4:30
there is a keyword here search query
4:32
that I can improve my website for to
4:36
enjoy higher clicks because a lot of
4:40
people are searching for these
4:43
keywords I can press on the query
4:47
itself and then look at the pages I can
4:50
see there's three different
4:53
pages and they are not performing that
4:56
great now I have to do a bit of research
5:00
I
5:01
can look at who I'm competing
5:05
with well in this example I'm competing
5:08
with Google and with AI overviews people
5:11
may quickly find the answer to those
5:15
search queries but nonetheless when you
5:19
explore search results as in performance
5:22
results you can gain great
5:26
insights you can anytime add different
5:29
field s whether it's queries
5:32
containing or not containing and so
5:36
on now here we don't want to waste a lot
5:39
of time but rather see what Google
5:42
values our website for so that our
5:46
content can be improved or we can create
5:51
new content that is somehow
5:54
related at that moment you may also want
5:58
to utilize Google
6:01
Trends asking
6:04
yourself you know what do you as in
6:07
whether you're a newcomer site or a
6:09
local Business website it doesn't matter
6:12
you have to have your thumb on the pulse
6:15
of your
6:17
industry and performance reports can
6:20
show you that at times depending on your
6:23
industry or Google Trends can show you
6:26
that or exploring Google search bar Bo
6:30
by
6:31
tinkering delete my activity in this
6:34
example only doesn't matter what the
6:36
keywords are and I can say okay do
6:40
people ask related questions as I can
6:44
see for this keyword I'm getting no
6:48
results but let's say how to delete my
6:52
activity still no results how to delete
6:55
my Google activity in this example so
6:59
let let's explore more more
7:04
more okay there's some discussions
7:07
happening that's how you utilize Google
7:09
to find new keyword
7:13
ideas that's how you look at performance
7:16
reports because then you know what the
7:19
target you know what's
7:22
working you know what you can improve on
7:25
your
7:27
website so especially in
7:31
2025 in fact you have to utilize
7:35
question oriented
7:37
words I've been saying that for a few
7:39
years already but now in 2025 that's
7:43
more
7:45
important because people are searching
7:47
Google differently
7:50
now as your site grows depending on your
7:53
industry you may utilize discover
7:56
feature rank your website and YouTube
7:59
Channel shows you have to do that then
8:02
let's look at indexing because that's
8:04
important part of search
8:06
console when looking at Google search
8:09
console page indexing
8:11
reports you want to always look at all
8:14
submitted
8:15
pages instead of all known Pages don't
8:20
waste time with all known Pages look at
8:23
all submitted
8:25
Pages where do they come from they come
8:28
from the pages you've submitted in your
8:35
sitemap so here we want to
8:38
explore in this example Google has
8:41
discovered currently L index there's two
8:43
URLs I need to know what they are in
8:47
this example I may delete that content
8:51
because obviously that's perhaps
8:53
outdated
8:57
content yeah and so in 2025 I should
9:01
actually delete this because Google is
9:04
looking at it and it's saying you know
9:06
what we're not going to Index this
9:08
because there is better content on
9:12
internet but page indexing reports are
9:15
very important for all submitted
9:18
pages and I've created all the tutorials
9:21
for fixing each and every
9:25
problem then if you have videos on your
9:28
website let's imagine you publish
9:34
videos on your website instead of
9:37
YouTube embeds well if that's the case
9:40
these reports will be absolutely
9:42
critical if you're embedding YouTube
9:44
videos then they are already indexed in
9:47
Google anyway they are not part of your
9:51
website per se they are part of
9:55
YouTube then we have core web vitals now
9:59
this is one area you must pay attention
10:03
to in most cases you may ignore URLs
10:08
that need Improvement if your resources
10:11
do not allow you to focus on them but if
10:16
Corb vitals reports show you po
10:19
URLs you have to focus on them because
10:23
they are costing you Google
10:27
rankings then we have enhancement
10:29
enhancement reports come
10:32
from Google structure data for Rich
10:38
results okay let me show you that
10:41
quickly and easily structure data
10:44
product local business
10:46
intro Google in
10:49
2025 supports various schema markup
10:53
types you can find them through the help
10:57
section let's take a look at e-commerce
11:00
sites product structure data will be
11:03
very
11:04
important because your products can
11:08
prominently show in Google search
11:10
results using structured
11:13
data if you're a local business you can
11:16
utilize structured data for your local
11:18
business as
11:20
well there are many
11:22
plugins that allow you to insert
11:25
structured data or you can invest in
11:29
professional web developers who are
11:32
experienced with structured data to
11:35
fully mark up your business
11:39
website and if your structure data is
11:43
valid it will show up on the enhancement
11:46
reports if there is invalid markup then
11:50
search console shows you
11:53
that let's
11:55
imagine videos
11:59
I am embedding YouTube
12:02
videos and I'm using structured data for
12:06
them then we have security and manual
12:10
actions most websites will not have
12:13
problems if they're doing everything
12:16
correctly according to google
12:21
guidelines as in search
12:24
Essentials technical guidelines spam
12:27
policies and best practices
12:30
but if for some
12:33
reason you hired in experience so-called
12:37
seos doing funny stuff then search
12:41
console security and manual actions will
12:45
show you if there is any manual actions
12:47
what you can do to remove the action or
12:51
if there is any security
12:54
issues always be thoughtful of giving
12:56
access to your website
12:59
then we have links here as your business
13:03
website grows you may want to look at
13:07
you know who is linking to you what text
13:10
is used when people link to you and so
13:14
on ideally you want to make
13:19
sure that your content is easy to
13:24
share so that means create sharable
13:27
content and make it easy easy for people
13:30
to share and encourage them to
13:33
share because then you will obtain
13:36
natural backlinks allowing
13:39
Google to build a profile on your
13:43
website in terms of its Authority and
13:49
trustworthiness then we have our
13:51
settings let's press on that here you
13:54
can manage general settings you have
13:57
crawling insights I won't cover that
13:59
because most websites won't need to play
14:02
around with these but nonetheless they
14:05
are there for you to
14:06
explore you can grant access to
14:10
different people and here it will all
14:12
show up
14:14
here so then we have URL inspection tool
14:19
let's imagine your website is having
14:22
page indexing
14:24
problems let's imagine excluded by no
14:27
index tag let's look at some URLs let's
14:32
copy the
14:33
URL we can use the URL inspection tool
14:36
here by pasting the URL then press
14:40
enter and now obviously that is not on
14:43
Google as in it's not indexed by Google
14:46
why because it's excluded by no index
14:50
tag that's why page indexing report is
14:54
very
14:55
important when you use page indexing
14:58
report you want to also utilize URL
15:02
inspection tool you can also test live
15:06
URL whereby Google will then fetch the
15:09
URL that is having problem to show you
15:12
more insights as to what's going
15:18
on as we can see it's saying we cannot
15:21
index that page because you're telling
15:22
us no
15:24
index and it gives us more details these
15:28
are perhaps technical for most website
15:30
owners but
15:33
nonetheless for page indexing problems
15:36
for all submitted Pages you want to
15:39
explore your ra inspection
15:42
tool apart from that you've got the
15:45
overview to quickly and easily see
15:47
overview of your
15:49
reports
15:51
so once again the most important is
15:55
performance
15:56
reports page indexing
16:00
ensuring the S maps are submitted
16:03
correctly then Corb vitals focus on PO
16:08
URLs make sure there are
16:11
none if the resources are there surely
16:14
you can improve the URLs that need
16:19
Improvement then we have enhancement
16:22
reports we need to make sure the schema
16:26
markup is valid
16:29
the links report I hardly utilize it
16:34
because we shouldn't be focused too much
16:36
on the link reports but rather we should
16:40
focus on content for the best interest
16:44
of our website
16:45
visitors because that's what Google
16:49
wants in
16:51
2025 and Beyond creating helpful
16:55
reliable people first content
16:59
and the Google search console
17:01
tool is your website's friend before I
17:05
close up let me show you this
17:07
performance report you will see
17:10
fluctuations most people don't
17:12
understand why this
17:14
is and thus they suggest that it's
17:16
Google
17:17
dance or something like that Google
17:20
doesn't
17:21
dance the reason there is this
17:23
fluctuation is because of Google
17:26
algorithms it's testing to see which web
17:30
pages answers the question of the
17:33
Searcher that is why looking at Google
17:37
search
17:38
console couple with Google guidelines

This is the tool that makes your website and Google friends with each other and you are the mediator in between.
0:05
You both have BFFs. You get to hear from Google and you also get to know about your website. You also get to know what are the problems of your website and you also get to know what are the expectations and complaints that Google has from your website.
0:18
So Google Search Console is very important. Whether you are starting your career now or you have been doing SEO for many years, you will always find some points in Google Search Console that you might not have thought of before. In today's class, we will start learning Google Search Console from
0:32
the basics. And slowly we will go to the advanced level. But if you are an old SEO veteran, then also watch the whole video so that you will definitely get some new things.
0:41
And in the upcoming classes, we will see the very advanced use of Google Search Console. Where we will see some dashboards of news websites, some e-commerce big websites.
0:51
Where you will get to know how issues are compiled and how you can solve them in Google Search Console on a big level where there are millions of pages.
1:00
So in this series, you will also start understanding Google Search Console from the basics. And you will also see the content of 50-20 million traffic websites at a very advanced level.
1:10
You will see their issues and learn to solve them. Now this is the fourth class of this course. If you have not attended the previous three classes and missed any of them, then go and watch those classes first.
1:20
And then attend this class. Only then you will get the full benefit of this course. We have structured the course in such a way that you watch the classes one after the other and get to learn everything.
1:29
Apart from this, note down all your doubts about this class or the previous class. So that you can ask your questions in the upcoming live doubt session on Sunday.
1:40

You will see the join button on the side of the subscribe button. The cost is 29 rupees per month. Two samosas are coming.
1:54
Join and move your career forward. Let's go to the computer screen and start learning Google Search Console.
2:01
Google Search Console So we have come to the computer screen.
2:11
And those who have attended the previous class know that this is a basic diagram of Google Search.
2:18
So we have not landed on Google Search Console but on Google Search Engine. And this is not by mistake. Before understanding Google Search Console, you will have to see what is the use of Google Search Console.
2:28
A lot of things become clear from here. Trust me, a lot of senior SEOs also fail to fully utilize the use of Google Search Console.
2:36
The reason is that you don't know its use case. The work of Google Search Console is to smooth out the connection between you and your website.
2:46
It is not possible that Google visits your website and everything becomes smooth. The reason is that Google Search Engine is a very complex process in itself.
2:55
Somewhere, your URL is being extracted. Then it is being crawled in batches.
3:00
Then its content is being stored. Its lexicons are being made. Content is being explained.
3:06
Again, the URL is being extracted and sent to the URL server. A lot of pages are being ranked.
3:12
Some pages will look good in Google. Some pages will look good in Google. Some will not look good. Google can have problems with a lot of URLs in this complex system.
3:22
Whenever there is a problem, what should it do? Should it ignore your website? You don't want that. You want Google to tell you about the problems it is facing with your website.
3:33
And this is what Google Search Console does. Google Search Console comes in the middle of all this.
3:41
Its job is to come in between your website and Google and smooth out your communication.
3:49
This is the job of Google Search Console. Now, Google Search Console is a portal between your website and Google.
3:56
You have understood this. Now, let's try to understand the behavior of Google Search Console. I will make a different node here.
4:03
And it is very important for you to understand the basics of Google Search Console. Google Search Console is a low-memory system.
4:10
It is a low-performance system. It is a low-priority system. Now, what do I mean by low-performance or low-priority system?
4:16
Google Search Console is a tool available for every website for free. Google keeps dumping information related to your website.
4:23
It is your responsibility to dissect that information, understand it and resolve it on its basis.
4:29
But Google cannot give this tool called Google Search Console a high priority. Because it requires a lot of resources.
4:36
You should always remember this point while using Google Search Console. Because there are many scenarios where we fix a problem but Google Search Console does not update it.
4:45
And then we keep getting confused whether this problem is solved or not. And many times, we increase our complication to solve a solved problem.
4:53
That's why, always remember that Google Search Console is a low-priority, low-performance system. Where you will get to know the problems after some delay.
5:01
And you will get to know the solution after some time. To use Google Search Console, you can search directly.
5:08
Search Console. And whatever is the first result you see, click on it. And then click on Start Now button.
5:14
When you open Google Search Console for the first time, you will see a screen like this. Where you can see two choices.
5:20
This is not a blue pill or a red pill. These are actually both blue pills. Where you have to eat both. Okay.
5:26
Here you can see two things. Domain and URL prefix. And I will explain the difference between these two. But you have to use both.
5:32
Here, one more thing is important. All these Google services start with Google account, Gmail account.
5:39
So, you have to login to any website. So, you have to login to any email ID. So, you have to login to any website with Google account.
5:49
Like I have logged in here with an ID. So, now let's see what is the difference between domain and URL prefix.
5:55
And how do you utilize it. So, when you purchase a domain. Google.com. Mamytiwari.net.
6:01
XYZ.com. Whatever you purchase, you only purchase a domain. So, let's say example.com. This is our domain.
6:07
When you link example.com with Google Search Console.
6:13
So, it is called domain property. Okay. And when we add the URL of the website with Google Search Console.
6:20
So, it is called URL prefix property. Let's take a very simple example. Everything is URL prefix property.
6:26
And everyone has their own domain. For example, if I visit Google.com. So, you can see here Google.com.
6:33
Google.com. This is a small trick of browsers which increases confusion for us. So, people can see Google.com.
6:39
You can also see Google.com. But if I click here once. So, let's see what URL can be seen.
6:45
HTTPS www.google.com. So, although every URL prefix property is a part of some domain.
6:53
But when it will open, it will be a URL prefix property. So, now the question arises that what should we connect?
7:00
We should connect both. What will be the use of both? You will understand this gradually. Now, all the websites I visit.
7:07
Whenever I get an audit. A new client signs up. Someone provides me access to their website. To show.
7:13
For help. Either they have a URL prefix property. Or they have made a domain property by watching a new tutorial.
7:19
Which is a wrong approach. If you have a website example.com. So, you have to link the domain property too.
7:26
That is example.com. And you have to link the URL prefix property too.
7:32
Now, what will be the URL prefix property? It depends on the structure of your website. It is possible that you or your client have made a property by www.
7:40
So, you can connect it. It is possible that your website owner or client or boss. Did not use www.
7:47
So, you have to use HTTPS example.com. You go and visit your website. After visiting, click here like this.
7:54
See which URL you can see. If it is with www. So, you have to connect with www. If it is not with www.
8:01
So, you have to connect without it. But you have to connect the URL prefix property too. And domain name property.
8:07
It is very important to connect both. Okay. So, now we come back to Google Search Console.
8:13
And after coming here. We see that we have to connect this domain property. The process of connecting the domain property.
8:19
It is a little different. I will explain. So, here we have to enter our domain. Which we want to connect with Google Search Console.
8:25
So, I will enter my domain here. Delhibelly.site Funny name.
8:31
Delhibelly.site Here we are entering instead of domain. We will not enter in URL prefix property. I promise.
8:37
I am verifying the domain first. So that the work of URL prefix is easy. You will have to work very hard.
8:44
To verify the URL prefix once. Once if it becomes domain. So, here I have entered the domain. And then after that I will click on the continue button.
8:53
Let it check for verification. It will verify once. Whether you own this domain or not. Why is verification important?
8:59
So that you can go and verify any website. In Google Search Console. Because Google can't do this.
9:06
That's why it asks for verification from you. What is the method of verification? That you have to add a record to this domain. Delhibelly.site Which I am saying is my domain.
9:13
You have to add a record to its records. To verify. So, the method of adding a record here.
9:20
That is TXT. For those who are new. It may be a little difficult for them. You may find the process a little tricky.
9:26
But it's very simple. You just follow the steps. So, here is the TXT record. I am using this method. If you click here.
9:32
You will also see the CNAME. But we use CNAME to create a sub-domain. What is a sub-domain? We will find out later.
9:38
Let's not talk about it now. Let's keep the TXT record selected. And come down here. Here you can see the particular TXT record.
9:44
Which you have to link. Which you have to use. So, we click on the copy button here. Okay.
9:51
Now, I will go to my domain panel. Where this domain has been registered.
9:57
I have to manage the domain there. I'll click on the Manage button. So, now I'll come to the panel where the domain has been registered.
10:05
This process can be different for some hosting providers, but if your website is already hosted on a C-Panel hosting, which 70-80% of hosting providers already provide, all the steps will be the same there.
10:16
The big steps will be the same. If you still feel any problem, then go to your hosting or the domain where you have registered, go to their support, chat with them, tell them that this is my TXT record,
10:26
I have to add this to the website, then they will add it. It's not a very complicated process. Now, I'll search for the zone here.
10:33
I'll search for the zone, I'll see the zone editor. I'll select the zone editor. After this, I'll have to find my website.
10:41
This is my dailybelly.website. In front of this dailybelly website, I have to click on this Manage button.
10:46
Okay. We have clicked on the Manage button. Now, we have the option to create different records here. Let's click on this button called Add Record, or click on the arrow here, and then Add TXT Record. These are the simplest types of records.
10:59
Here, you can see different records that have different purposes. For example, if we use A record, then we can redirect a particular URL to a specific IP address.
11:10
We use MX record when we create email-related records. We use CNAME record when we have to create a separate sub-domain.
11:18
We use CAA record. I don't know because I have never made it. It's not necessary for SEO.
11:23
Okay. So, let's click on TXT record. You should keep accepting if you don't know anything.
11:29
Right? It's more important to not know than to know, so that if you get a chance to learn in the future, you don't have the ego in your mind that I won't learn.
11:36
I know everything. If I cancel this process here for 2 seconds, and again, instead of looking for this A record button,
11:42
I directly click on Add Record, then you can select this type from here, TXT.
11:47
Okay. We come to TXT record. Now, we have to paste the same value that we copied from here instead of the record. It's very easy to learn.
11:57
Nothing is complicated here. You won't hurt anything. I will tell you in advance if there is any risky thing. So, keep an empty mind and learn easily.
12:05
So, we copied it here. After copying, we came back to our zone editor. Here, we pasted the record.
12:10
Just keep in mind that we have to make this type TXT. Okay. After this, I am going backwards.
12:16
The importance is the same. So, here comes the TTL value. TTL is not a very complicated thing.
12:22
TTL means Time To Live. This means that the record that you are pasting, if you remove it tomorrow, then how long it will be active, it will be removed after that.
12:31
This value is in seconds. So, if I paste 1 second here, right? And after making the record here,
12:37
I come back tomorrow and delete it from here. So, this system of your hosting company, it will allow you to keep it for 1 second. After 1 second, it will start making the change.
12:46
So, this is given because sometimes there are sensitive records. Suppose, if you want to undo something tomorrow, you will get some time.
12:52
But here, we will minimize this value. Different hosting providers have different values here.
12:57
Let's say, this hosting has limited this value to 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, for this many seconds.
13:04
You can make it this much, no problem. But I always prefer to minimize this value. So, I will set it to 300.
13:10
Why am I setting it to 300? 300 means 5 minutes. Most of the hosting companies minimize the 300 value.
13:16
The premium hosting companies give you the option to set it to 10, 12 seconds. But there is no need for that and it doesn't make a big difference.
13:22
So, we will set it to 300 here. After this, comes the name. Now, what is this zone name? Here, the name is not given.
13:29
There is no name here. Correct? This is not problematic. Because whenever we put a name for a TXT record, it has to be for the entire domain. You have to verify the entire domain.
13:39
That's why we have to enter the entire domain name here. Some hosting companies, again, if you make it at the rate, then they automatically make it effective for the entire domain.
13:48
Some hosting providers don't do this. So, we come here and type our domain name.
13:53
DelhiBelly.site As it is, type it. No need to type www or https.
13:59
Just type it as it is. Now, I will click on the save record button. Here, I can see the error.
14:04
We have already added this record for another account. Its value is 14,400.
14:10
Now, I am trying to use 300 and I can see the error. So, I will have to set this value to 14,400.
14:17
But you can also use 300 if you are establishing this value for a new domain. After doing this again, I will click on the save record button.
14:24
And this record will be saved here. Done. Now, when you come to the zone record and add a new record for a new domain, it takes time for it to propagate.
14:36
It takes time for this information to reach all the servers in the world. So, I come back to the Google Search Console.
14:42
And here, I have to click on the verify button. I click on it. Maybe, it will show verified here.
14:49
Which it did. Sometimes, it happens that if your domain registrar or hosting company has a low budget, then it may take some time for them to propagate that change.
14:59
If it takes time, then you don't have to worry. You can check it after a while, after 5 minutes, after 10 minutes, or after an hour.
15:07
Then it will be done. There is no problem in this. Here, I click on the done button. And here, I am on this screen.
15:13
If I had clicked on go to property, then I could have gone to the property. I clicked on the done button so that I can show you how to go to the property.
15:20
If I click here, on this button, search property dailybelly.site. Let's click on it.
15:25
Here, you will see this page. There is no information. Because there is no traffic on this website.
15:32
There is no website on this domain. Now, I had promised you that you can easily make the HTTPS properties.
15:40
So, I come back here. I will click on this drop-down. If I click on the add property button, I will see the same prop up again.
15:46
This time, we will add the value HTTPS www.dailybelly.site.
15:55
I click on the continue button. Let's wait. And it is already verified. Now, I have not used any method of verification here.
16:03
Why didn't I use it? Because there is no need. If you have verified the domain, then you don't need to verify the other parts separately.
16:11
Everything is verified automatically. If I didn't do this process, if I didn't verify the domain, then I would have to go and upload the file, etc.
16:21
I would have to do a lot of methods. And if you want to know these methods, then there is a special video in which this process has been shown.
16:28
You can go and watch that video. I won't do it now. Because in today's date, if you want to do SEO, if you want to use Google Search Console, then you should add the domain property as well as the URL prefix property.
16:41
So, you verify the domain property. And after that, you connect the URL prefix property.
16:46
Only then the steps will be complete. I will finish it. We are here. You can see the HTTPS www.delhibelly.site in the drop-down.
16:55
Now, when you connect your website to your domain for the first time, it is possible that you will see a small clock here.
17:01
We will put another screenshot here in editing. This means that you have connected this website to Google Search Console for the first time.
17:08
It will take time for Google to collect the data and show it to you. So, Google keeps collecting data related to your website, but it doesn't start showing it.
17:18
It will start showing it only when you connect to Google Search Console for the first time. Connect to any Google Search Console.
17:24
Now, I can't see the clock here because I created this domain around 26th May.
17:31
Then I must have connected it with some other demo account. So, since then, I can see the data here.
17:36
Now, the fact that the data is zero is a different thing because the website is not created yet. I don't think the website is created yet.
17:41
Yes, the website is not created yet. So, there will be traffic. Right? Neither will there be Navmantel, nor will Radha dance. So, here you can see an empty dashboard.
17:50
Now, what will I show you in an empty dashboard? That's why we will connect another website to this account so that I can show you how to use Google Search Console with some data.
18:00
So, now we have connected a small bakery website to this account and we will use its data to continue this class.
18:09
Now, here you can see that I have connected two properties. I have connected the domain property and the website as it is.
18:17
It is a small bakery website and it is based in Canada. We will use it. Now, here you can see that this dashboard looks very overwhelming on its own.
18:24
If you are using Google Search Console for the first time in this field, it will look very daunting.
18:30
There are a lot of different properties. You can also see the graph. If you had to read so much, then why didn't you do it? There will be all these doubts.
18:35
But, actually, this is very simple and you have to learn it. Use it until you get it right.
18:41
Now, when you land on Google Search Console for the first time on any website, the first page that you see here, which will be your landing page, will be this Overview dashboard. Overview means that you get a snapshot of all the situations, conditions,
18:55
directions, etc. of this website. First of all, I am ignoring this part as well. First of all, you can see the performance here.
19:02
This is the performance of the last three months. This means that in the last three months, you can see how many clicks this website is getting per day.
19:09
So, in the last three months, the total number of clicks it has got is 6,159. Okay? This is the total number of web search clicks it has got.
19:16
After this, let's come down and see. You will see the recommendations. This means that this website is related to Google. Some of the important messages of Google, what to do, what to pay attention to, what is good and what is bad, you can see the automatic recommendations of Google here.
19:28
Some people will see less, some people will see more. There are different methods and meanings. Let's leave it. As soon as we come back down, we can see Indexing.
19:36
This means that how many pages of this website have been indexed by Google. We talked about Indexing, when Google saves a copy of the pages of your website.
19:47
If Google does not save a copy, then it will not even rank. You will not even get traffic.
19:52
Now we know that 32 pages of your website have not been indexed and 71 pages have been indexed.
19:58
Okay? Is it clear so far? This is also a status of 3 months. Let's come down to experience, that is, what is the user's experience about this website.
20:08
Now I will not talk about the speed of the website, because it will be a little tough for our new students.
20:16
Let's keep it easy. Experience means, let's say, we opened this website, Nidha Street, how soon is it opening?
20:24
If a website opens too late, then people will not like it. They will not spend much time on it.
20:30
They will have to wait. Who wants to wait these days? So Google does not give good rank to such slow websites.
20:38
So if you want your website to have a good rank, then the website should be fast.
20:44
Now how many pages of your website does Google think are fast? How many pages are not fast?
20:50
All these things can be found here in the experience section. After this, there is an overview related to structure data.
20:58
Now we will open all these sections and see in detail. There are many options, but now you have to understand that the overview tab always gives you an overview.
21:10
But we don't spend too much time here. Once you learn Google Search Console, you will never pay attention to the overview tab.
21:18
It is important to understand that many times students, even experienced SEOs, don't know the real traffic.
21:26
Some say Google Search Console, some say Google Analytics. But the truth is in the middle.
21:32
Neither Google Search Console nor Google Analytics have it. Here it is seen that in the last three months, 6,159 clicks have been received on nidastreet.ca.
21:44
This does not mean that 6,159 people have come. Maybe people have clicked more than once on your website.
21:52
This is just the data of web search clicks. What does this mean? Let's say I come to Google Search and search nidastreet.
22:00
I search the word nidastreet. And here their website is visible in the search results.
22:06
Correct? This website is visible in the search results. If I click on this result here, as soon as I click,
22:13
I have clicked from the Google Search results page. So this is one click here. Now these will not be 6,159 clicks, but 6,160 clicks.
22:21
Because I just clicked after searching. If I click back and click again, then it will be 6,161 clicks.
22:29
This is a click. But when a user comes to a website, he does not just go by looking at the homepage.
22:35
If I click on one of these cakes and visit an internal page, then the counter will not increase here.
22:43
Because Google Search Console has data only from Google Search. From Google Search,
22:49
I clicked only for this homepage. Once when I clicked on one page, I came inside, then Google Search will not get the information now.
22:57
Now here if I click on 50, 60, 100 pages on this website, and keep looking at those pages, then you will not get that information here.
23:05
That internal traffic information you get in another tool called Google Analytics, which we will learn later.
23:11
Here you get only from Google Search. So it is possible that 5,000 people have seen 25,000 pages on your website.
23:17
But here you will see 6,159 only. Because this is the amount that you get from Google Search.
23:25
It is important to be this clear. It is possible that tomorrow on your website, if a website owner says that my server bill is increasing a lot.
23:33
My server is telling me that 25,000 people are coming to me. But you are saying that only 6,159 clicks are happening on Google Search Console.
23:41
This means that 6,159 people have entered inside, and have seen more pages.
23:47
Some have seen 2, some have seen 3, some have seen 10 pages. So the number is increasing. Total traffic is a different thing.
23:53
Total page views is a different thing. And the traffic coming from Google Search is a different thing. There is one more metric here that we should keep in mind, which is impression.
24:03
What is impression? Once I come to Google Search and search for any keyword,
24:09
I can see my URL here. It is possible that I click on it. If I had clicked on it, it would have been an impression.
24:15
Just an impression. If I click on it, it is both an impression and a click. It won't be an impression.
24:21
It is both an impression and a click. So let's go back to Google Search Console. You can see the overview tab here.
24:27
After overview, there is insight and URL inspection. We won't see this now. Let's come to the performance tab.
24:33
In some websites, you will see only one tab for performance. In some websites,
24:39
Google search results and Google News will be there. In some websites, you will see Google News along with Discover.
24:47
So there can be a section here or there can be a lot of options in the section. Right now, I will click on Google Search results.
24:53
It is possible that you will see only the performance tab here. Now this is the first page which is very important for you in Google Search Console.
25:01
It tells you how well your website is doing in Google Search. Now on this tab, you can see the 3-month data.
25:09
In the overview tab, you can see the 3-month data. The default date range of Google Search Console is 3 months.
25:17
You can also see the filter here. Before coming to the filter, let's see some major candidates.
25:23
Click, you can see the number of times people click on this website's URL.
25:29
What is the impression? The number of times your website's URL is visible. After this, comes CTR.
25:35
Average CTR. If Google is showing your website 100 times, then how many times are people clicking on it?
25:43
For this website, the average CTR is 1.2%. When all the URLs of this website are shown 100 times on the Google Search results page, then only 1.2 times people click on it.
25:57
After this, comes the average position. For any page of this website, for any keyword, what is the position on this number?
26:07
It's 10.2. I just searched for Nidha Street. It's the brand keyword.
26:13
If I search for another keyword tomorrow, and there is another rank for that keyword, then it keeps increasing or decreasing the average position.
26:21
The word average position shows the average position for all the URLs of this website.
26:27
You can see clicks, impressions, average CTR, and position.
26:33
We usually don't look for the whole website because that number will always be less. If you see, the average position of my website is 10, but your impressions will be more.
26:43
For some keywords, you might be in the 14th position. So, the average position number automatically goes down.
26:49
Don't focus on this. It's important to see clicks and impressions. You can see some filters on this.
26:55
If you want to see the data of the last 24 hours, then we will click on 24 hours. 55 clicks, 4.8 impressions.
27:01
If you want to see the data of 7 days, then you can click on 7, 28 days, and so on.
27:07
If you want to see the data of more than 3 months, then click on the more button. 6, 12, 16.
27:13
You won't get data of more than 16 months in Google Search Console. When we come to the advanced topics of Google Search Console, we will tell you how you can save the data.
27:23
For now, we get options for 6, 12, and 16 months. For example, if I click on 16 months,
27:29
I will get the data of the last 16 months. I will get the data of clicks, impressions, average CTR, average position, and so on.
27:39
Okay? Let's come to the second option. Apart from seeing the traffic, we also have the option of comparing.
27:47
For example, if you want to compare the last 24 hours with the last 24 hours, then you can use this.
27:55
If you want to compare the last 24 hours with the last 24 hours, then you can click on this button.
28:01
Let's say, this previous period and year-over-year can be a little confusing.
28:09
For example, if I come to 28 days, I will compare the last 28 days.
28:15
Right now, we are shooting on 27th August. If I select this option,
28:21
Google will compare between two ranges. One will compare the data from 1st August to 28th August.
28:29
The other will compare the data between the same time in July.
28:35
If I select compare last 28 days to year-over-year, it will mean that the data from 1st August to 28th August 2025 will be compared with the data from 1st August to 28th August 2024.
28:51
This is the meaning of year-over-year. Both these options are important because sometimes, some business are seasonal.
29:01
Let's say, you have a catering business or a banquet hall business. When there is a wedding, there is traffic.
29:09
If you compare October, November, December traffic with March, April, May or July, August, September, you will see less traffic because they pick more traffic during the season.
29:23
In such businesses, we do year-over-year comparison. Now, you can select the date and period you want to compare.
29:33
Click on the apply button. Now, you can compare the data you saw.
29:39
In the 28 days before this website, the traffic was 1.9 thousand and in the last 28 days, it was 1.81 thousand.
29:49
Impressions are less and traffic is also less. If you want to add FSCTR, you can click on it and remove the impression or the average position. You can also see the value of one of these or all the four values at the same time, it all depends on you.
30:08
Now you can see how fresh the data is. Here you can see a small information about when the data was updated.
30:17
But before coming to this, we have to see two more filters. Here we have seen filters in the date range. You do not get this specific date range, you can also select date and time here.
30:28
By selecting date and time, you can see the performance of a particular website on a specific date. For example, let's say I do not want to see these 28 days, 3 months, etc.
30:37
I want to compare July's data with June. I do not want to do all this. So I come here, what will be my start date? 1st July.
30:47
Okay. And then what will be the end date? 31st July. I want to compare this with June's data.
30:54
So I come here and select June. 1st June. And then my end date will be 30th June.
31:05
Here it says year 2025. I bring it back to June. I have selected June. So here we are comparing data from 1st July to 31st July.
31:14
Data from 1st June to 30th June. Click on the Apply button. A good comparison of June and July is ready in front of me.
31:22
So in June, we only had 2.02K clicks. But in July, we had 2.12K clicks.
31:29
Okay. So in this way, you can see the exact monthly data frame and time frame. On its side, we have some other filters.
31:37
The first filter is Search Type. If we come to Google Search, you can see that I have searched for Dhaa Street.
31:43
But here, one is All, which means all the results will be visible at once. Or here are images.
31:49
Shopping. Video. Short video. News. More. A lot more.
31:55
Okay. So here we come back to Google Search Console. You can also see some options here. Web. Image.
32:01
Video. News. If you want to see how much the total web traffic results match with the image results, how much is less or more, if you want to do a comparison, you can see from here.
32:16
The Compare tab is here. But for now, let's filter. We want to see how much traffic we get from the images, not from the website. So I selected the image.
32:22
I clicked on the Apply button. Now I am being shown the data of this date range, June and July, but only the traffic coming from the image.
32:32
Okay. Now this is not important for every website. There are some websites where there are more images, where the images are more useful.
32:39
For example, let's say you do wedding photography, travel photography, there are a lot of images on your website. And you want to see how much traffic you are getting from those images.
32:46
And is that traffic increasing or decreasing? So you can use this filter here. Or you can also compare. If you want to compare your image and video traffic, then you will select the image once, then the video, click on the Apply button, and you will get a comparison.
33:02
You will get a comparison of the data between your image and video traffic. They are not getting any traffic from the video.
33:09
Now let's go back to the search type, so that we have more data. And you can see some filters here.
33:16
Filters are very useful. I will select this filter here. After selecting the filter, you will see that there are different types here.
33:23
There is query, page type, country, device, and search appearance. I will come down a little bit here.
33:30
And let's see. Below this graph, you can see some buttons here. Query, page, country, device. What is this? Let's come down.
33:36
I will only show the query for now. Here you can see that one query is Nidha Street. For Nidha Street, in the last three months, here three months are selected.
33:43
How many clicks did you get in three months? 104. Total clicks are 6.16. Total clicks are 6,159.
33:50
But how many clicks did you get for which keyword? This is important to see. Out of these total 6,159 clicks, you got 104 clicks for the Nidha Street keyword.
34:01
Many people may have searched Nidha Street many times. But only 303 times Google has shown the link of this website.
34:11
And out of that, people have clicked 104 times. Showed 303 times. Clicked 104 times.
34:18
Similarly, the other keyword which I can't read at all. My Hindi medium will get confused while reading this. May get confused.
34:24
But for this keyword, Google has shown the link of our website 914 times.
34:30
Out of that, clicked 71 times. Similarly, for different keywords, the website has been shown many different times.
34:36
You also got clicks. Okay? This is the number. If I want to see how many times the website got impressions or clicks for a particular query,
34:49
I can use these filters. I can use these filters. Clicked on Add Filter button.
34:55
Clicked on Query. After clicking on Query, I can search here. Let's say, Nidha's.
35:01
I didn't put Nidha Street. I just put Nidha's. Here you can see another filter. Query containing.
35:08
If I click on Query containing and click on Apply button, it will show the result for all those queries which have the word Nidha's.
35:18
May be it's Nidha Street. May be it's Nidha's. May be it's Nidha Street Review. Because Nidha's is common among these three.
35:26
Okay? If I come back here, it's Query containing. It should be in any query.
35:33
If I make it Query not containing and then apply, I will get the traffic for all the other keywords.
35:40
Only those with Nidha's will be removed. That is, any query which has the word Nidha's will not be shown in the report.
35:47
The rest will be shown. So if you want to see how much traffic I get for my own brand keyword,
35:53
I will select Query containing and enter my brand name. If I want to see how much traffic I get other than branded,
36:01
I will click on Query not containing. But what if I only want this word. It's not like Nidha's Street, Nidha's Street Review,
36:09
Nidha's Street Location, Address. No. I want to see how much traffic I get only for Nidha's word. So I come here and click on the Exact Query button.
36:18
Now the traffic I get is only for this particular word. For Nidha's. Right? Now Nidha's Street is gone.
36:25
Nidha's Street Review is gone. Only Nidha's is left. So this is the meaning of Query here and the filter given with Query.
36:32
We will not show the custom one now. Because Regex will become one level up. It will become complex.
36:38
We have a series of Regex related tutorials. There are 3-4 videos. You can see their link in the top right corner.
36:44
Those of you who are advanced and come from a programming background, you can go and watch it. But the rest, the new students can avoid it.
36:52
You don't need it now. Okay? Let's cancel it here. Let's remove it. After this, if we click on the Add filter, then the page comes.
37:02
The page is also the same. That is, the page, the URL of the website, has different words in the URL.
37:08
For example, let's say there are cakes. On the cake, there is a Birthday Cake page. Now its URL is nidhasstreet.ca slash birthday-cake.
37:17
If I come to the other cake, eggless cake, then here it is nidhasstreet.ca slash delicious eggless cakes and so on.
37:26
So here, if I want to see how much traffic a particular page has received or how much traffic a particular word URL has received, then I can use it here.
37:37
For example, if I come here and copy this URL exactly and then paste it here and then click on the Apply button, then I will get to see the traffic of this page.
37:49
In the last three months, for different queries, the page is the same. Right? The page is the same.
37:55
Because we have put a whole page here. Now here too, the URL containing is written. URL containing, exact URL.
38:01
Similarly, query containing, query not containing, exact query. So in query containing, you are getting only one URL data because this is one.
38:09
If here, this keyword, we would have one more page, dash two, then we would get two pages of data because this much data is already available.
38:18
But this is not the case. So we come here and if, let's say, we want to see data of such URLs in which somewhere the word cake has come.
38:27
So I will come here and remove everything from this URL containing. I will just write cake. You will get the data of all the URLs in which the word cake will come.
38:35
So I have left the URL containing selected. I have clicked on the apply button. And now let's see how many pages are there here.
38:43
NidhaasTreat.ca What cakes are healthy? Now this is written cakes, but there are C-A-K-E.
38:49
Something can happen before that, something can happen behind that, something will happen before that, something will happen later, but if the URL is in C-A-K-E then that URL will be shown in the report.
39:02
There are a lot of 62 URLs here which contain the word cake. If I change it a little bit here,
39:08
I will change it to cakes. So now see this cake word, this URL nidhaastreat.ca slash types of wedding cake, not cakes, will be removed from here.
39:19
As soon as I clicked on the apply button, 1, 2, 3, cake is removed.
39:26
Let's remove it once. We come to another filter which is country.
39:32
What does the country filter do? I clicked on country, for different countries.
39:39
Now here we do not get the option to add the country. We cannot make the name of the country imaginary, right? So here we can see how much traffic is coming from a particular country.
39:55
So the function of share is here also. If you want to see how is the traffic between two countries, for example, if you want to see the traffic, then here you can click on share.
40:12
You can also see the traffic between two countries. For example, if you want to see the traffic between two countries, you can This website is of an Indian owner, but the website is in Canada. So, I want to see what is the traffic between Canada and India. So, I selected Canada here, and India is typed
40:20
below. Now, when I click on the Apply button, I will get a comparison of the traffic between India and Canada. So, it is a 3-month data. Click from Canada, the total is 1.4, and 330 from India. Because the website is in Canada, it is a small website of a bakery, so you will get more from there.
40:28
So, there is not much difference in impressions, it is 39,000 impressions, but the click is less. Because the website is of Canada.
40:34
So, this country filter gives us the facility to see and compare traffic for different countries.
40:41
Similarly, we can also see the device, how much traffic your website is getting from the desktop, how much from the mobile, how much from the tablet, you can see all the data here.
40:49
So, if we select Desktop here and apply, then this number will be reduced, because every website gets very little traffic from the desktop.
40:57
Similarly, if you want to compare how much traffic you are getting between the desktop and the mobile, then we click on the Apply button here.
41:04
We will get to know that this website has got 5.17,000 clicks from the mobile in the last 3 months, and only 796 clicks from the desktop.
41:13
This is the same for every website. So, we can use these filters in this way and compare different features.
41:22
The last option here is Search Appearance. Let's see this too. You have seen the device. Let's come to Search Appearance. Translated Product, Product Snippets, Review Snippets.
41:29
Out of these, where is this website appearing the most? Now, what is this specifically? When we will see the SEO course further, then you will understand more.
41:40
That's why I will leave this topic for now. But if you want to see the review snippets of your website, you can see the review box below.
41:50
If I search here, Shoes for Men, you can see the star value here.
41:59
This is an ad. If we come to Organic Results, you can see the page of Myntra, and you can see the star rating here.
42:06
So, how much traffic is there? How many clicks are there? To get such star rating pages, review snippets, you get such information from here.
42:14
But then again, this will be very advanced. That's why we won't go into this topic for now. Let's leave this option too.
42:21
You can see that you can compare more than one filter. So, for example, I have put a cake filter here, URL containing.
42:27
After this, I can put another filter, which can be a query filter. Let's say, Nidhaas. So, I can match two different filters here and get the information.
42:37
Google Search Console is very flexible. It gives you options to use it in different ways. So, our performance section is almost done.
42:44
There are a few things left. Before coming down from this graph, you can see 2-3 icons here at the top.
42:51
And if we don't keep them in any section, then it looks a bit lacking. That's why I'll show them quickly. The bell icon you can see here, you can guess, is the notification icon.
43:00
So, it's not really that important. And when you work for many years, you will remember that you haven't clicked here for a long time.
43:06
Like I haven't clicked here for a long time. Because when you become an expert in Search Console, then you don't have to look here again and again.
43:13
You can find out by yourself. On the notification side, you can see the user settings. And these are not the settings of your account.
43:19
These are just the notification settings. So, here you can see the email preferences. If you click on this after coming here, then you can see only one option here.
43:28
Email notification. If you want, you can turn it off. But this is a disadvantage. The only small annoyance is that between 1st to 5th, on any particular date,
43:38
Google Search Console, will send you one email related to all your websites. Which sometimes makes your inbox feel full.
43:44
But apart from this, if you keep it on, then if there is any urgent email, any urgent notification, let's say, any email with a penalty, then you get it, which is very helpful.
43:54
So, keep it on. There is no harm in it. And then after this, Search Console and Search Results. This is basically a type of mechanism of Google Search Console, which shows the information related to your website in the search itself.
44:06
So, for example, if I search for nidahastreet.ca after coming to Google Search, then in the search results,
44:12
I can see the information related to Google Search Console as it is.
44:18
And this can be helpful sometimes. If you don't like this feature, then after coming here, for individual websites, you can turn this setting on and off.
44:26
But again, it's not that important. And I don't think I have used this feature in many websites.
44:32
So, you can leave it as it is. There is no problem. Here, in this entire tutorial, there will be some settings of Google Search Console which I will tell you very soon.
44:40
I won't explain them. Maybe there will be some things which I completely avoid. Because in my professional workflow, in my daily workflow,
44:48
I don't use them. And according to me, they are not useful. But if I leave any option, and if you want to know about it, then you can tell me in the comment section.
44:58
I will cover it in any video. But because I started using Google Search Console from that time when it was called Webmaster Tools.
45:05
And it's been many years now and there are many such settings which Google has added. But we never use them in our daily workflow.
45:11
We don't use them either. I mean, I don't use them and you won't use them either. But if you are curious, and which is a good thing, you can tell me in the comment section.
45:17
I will explain that too. Okay? You shouldn't be afraid of asking questions. When you get the answer after asking the question, and you don't remember the answer, you should be afraid of that.
45:26
So, we will come down from the bar chart here and you will see some tabs here. You have understood the queries till now.
45:32
These queries are not your keywords. There is a little confusion here. You must have heard the keyword many times.
45:38
The new students among you must have heard the keyword many times. Keyword is that thing which you want to try in your content.
45:46
Basically, you want to target. So, let's say that I come to this nidhasstreet.ca website.
45:53
And I come to this cakes section. And here is a birthday cake. Okay? So, here is a birthday cake.
46:00
How to host a birthday party with these remarkable birthday cakes. Okay? And then after this, you can see different headlines here.
46:09
So, you can see that the word birthday cakes is being repeated again and again. Because the SEO of this website wants to target the word birthday cakes.
46:18
So, what SEO targets is the keyword. Okay? But because SEO or website owner is targeting birthday cake, it is not necessary that the user will always search for birthday cakes.
46:28
It is possible that the user who is searching for Google can search for birthday cakes. Right? He can search for birthday cakes of different flavors.
46:36
He can search for cakes near me. He can search for cakes in Canada. He can search for anything. What does the user want? And Google wants to match the user's query, the user's question with your page.
46:46
If your page matches, your page will be visible in search results. Now, this is the thing. So, when you see a query here, query is the thing that people are searching for.
46:54
You have no control over this. Our control is only that we can see the healthiest cake query.
47:01
We can also see the healthy cake recipe query. So, if people are searching a lot for healthy cake, then why don't we go to our website and if there is no page with healthy cake, then I can make a healthy cake.
47:14
Right? If I make a healthy cake page for the query with healthy cake in which there is information related to healthy cake, then my website will start ranking.
47:23
It is a simple concept. It is a very simple logic. This is SEO. When people go to different sources, meet very big gurus and they will tell them semantics and then after this, they will tell them some tricks.
47:37
Then they will say, make 1500 backlinks, go and do it here. Then you forget this basic concept. That's all there is to search.
47:43
The concept is only this. Provide what the user wants. Right? A shopkeeper.
47:49
SEO comes mostly to local shopkeepers. There is a shopkeeper. Someone goes to the shopkeeper. The customer will go again and again.
47:55
He will ask for a special type of spice. He will ask for a special type of spice. He will put 4-5 stalks of the same spice in front of the shop.
48:01
Because he knows give the customer what he is asking for. Now, if the customer is coming to ask for a special type of spice and you are saying,
48:08
I have this special trick. If you mix these three different chemicals, the spice will be made. The customer will run away.
48:15
This is what we are doing in SEO. Provide the customer what he wants, the search engine what he wants. That is simple.
48:21
So, let's come back to our topic. Here you can see the queries. For these queries, you always have to identify.
48:28
So, here you can see the list of queries. You can see the click, you can see the impression. But how to use this?
48:34
The meaning of this table is that in the last three months when people searched for
48:40
Nidha Street World, then Google has shown 318 times, 318 times to some page of this website.
48:49
Okay. We don't know which page it has shown. Here we only know for this particular query, in three months.
48:56
So, in three months, all the people who searched for Nidha Street, anywhere in the world, the pages of Nidha Street, any page, has been shown 318 times, 318 times in Google Search Results.
49:08
Out of that, 109 times people have clicked on any URL. Okay.
49:14
Now, this is the keyword. I don't know how to pronounce it. So, I will leave it. I will definitely leave it. The third query here is
49:21
Healthy Cake Recipes. That means, in the last three months, people from all over the world have searched for
49:27
Healthy Cake Recipes 2276 times to some page of Nidha Street.
49:36
And when 2276 times has been shown, then people have clicked 66 times.
49:43
This is the basic understanding. Okay. Now, the question arises that okay, Nidha Street was searched
49:49
or the query of Nidha Street was shown 318 times on Google. But when 318 times has been shown, then which pages have been shown?
49:58
This can also be a question. How will we find out? Now, when we click on it, it will take some time and you will see the figure here.
50:08
The 318th time shown is for which particular date? Average CTR means click-through date.
50:15
When it was shown 100 times, how many times did people click on it? When it was shown 100 times, Nidha Street's pages were clicked 34.3 times.
50:23
What was the position? Number 1. Because it is our keyword brand name, not a big deal. Let's scroll down a bit. Here you can see the list of pages.
50:30
There is only one query in queries. Because we clicked on Nidha Street, there is only one query. Let's see the pages.
50:36
Home page is being shown. Contact Us page is being shown. Pricing Flavor page is being shown. About Us.
50:42
Again Pricing Flavor. I think there are 2 pages. Pricing-Flavor, Pricing and Flavor.
50:48
Then there is Gallery. There are 18 pages in total which are being shown.
50:54
18 pages are being shown for this one word and people are clicking on it. So we got to know what all scenarios are there.
51:01
Now when we clicked on Query, see what actually happened. Here the query filter was set automatically.
51:08
So even if you didn't click here, you could still see the query after clicking.
51:14
Now this is the exact query. Because if you contain the query, then apart from Nidha Street, you can also see Nidha Street Near Me, Best Nidha Street, Cakes of Nidha Street, all the random keywords are also visible.
51:25
We just needed the exact query. Now I will remove the filter again so that I can come back to the main page.
51:31
So here we can see the top queries, clicks and impressions on this table.
51:39
If you want to see the CTR and Average Position too, then click on both of them. They will come down automatically.
51:46
It came automatically by magic. Now the table that is being sorted here is sorted on the basis of clicks.
51:53
First of all, the queries with the most clicks are being shown. If you want to see which are the keywords with the most impressions, then click on Impressions.
52:02
So which query is getting the most impressions here? When people are searching for Eggless Cakes Near Me, then Nidha Street is getting a lot of impressions.
52:10
But the CTR and clicks are very less because maybe the position will be very low. Or maybe you will have to send Eggless Cakes Near Me.
52:18
One of the two can happen. Now if you want to see which query is getting the least impressions, then click on Impressions again and the table will flip.
52:28
Ascending and Descending, everything happens here. It is not written but it works like this. Okay.
52:34
Now you have understood the similarity. If you want to sort on the basis of CTR, then you can click on this. If you want to sort on the basis of position, then you can click on this.
52:42
However you want to see. We have to see the position a little bit upside down here. Because if the position is 85, then it is not much.
52:48
If the impression is more in number and volume, then it is better to have a good impression volume. Impressions should always be seen as less as possible.
52:54
Clicks should always be seen as less as possible. CTR should always be seen as less as possible. Position should always be seen as more as possible. That is, you will see 100 out of 1 and not 100 out of 1.
53:01
Okay. You don't have to come down in the list. So this is the Query tab. After this comes the Page tab. Now after coming to the Page tab, it is the same thing.
53:08
Like I just showed you here that this Birthday Cake page can be shown for a lot of queries.
53:14
Now how to find out? So either we cut it from here. After cutting, let's see where the Birthday Cake page is.
53:21
Whichever page you click on, you will find out for which queries that page is being shown in Google search.
53:28
Just like you find out the page for a query, the same way you will find out the query for the page. See here, which queries this page is being shown for.
53:36
Okay. So now, similarly, we had copied the link of this page. So we come here.
53:42
We will come to the filter. And we will remove the link of this page. We will paste our link. It is important to have the exact URL.
53:49
Click on the Apply button. So now we will find out which queries our Birthday Cake page is being shown for.
53:56
Right. It is being shown here for these queries. Cool. Now I will click out again.
54:02
After this, the next tab is Countries. The method is the same. It is simple. It is a website of Canada. Maybe. Maybe not.
54:08
It is a website of Canada. But maybe you want to see that in the United States, in America, which queries are being performed better for which pages.
54:17
That is, if we go and see now, we have selected all the countries. So the Nidha Street keyword is coming with the most click.
54:25
Who is bringing the most impression? Eggless Cakes Near Me. But maybe you want to target the US as well. Which query is performing the best in the US?
54:32
So we will click on the United States here. And after clicking, again the filter is set there.
54:38
Okay. After this, we come here in Queries. Now let's see which query is performing the best. Now Healthy Cake is performing.
54:44
Eggless Cakes Near Me. Canada is performing. Canada has become more vegetarian. We want to see Healthy Cake in the US.
54:50
So it is shown there as well. Now the impressions are very good. But the clicks are less. Because the position of the site will be very down.
54:59
Right. So you have understood the meaning of the Country tab as well. Now let's come back. Here we can see the Device tab as well.
55:05
There is Search Appearance and Dates. Dates tab is very less needed. You are not going to use it. So I am not going to explain it.
55:11
In Search Appearance, you will not be able to see it so well in this website. I will give you a demo of some other website as well.
55:18
We will see in the parts coming in the class. There you will be able to see more clearly. After coming to Devices, you can see that most of the users are coming from mobile.
55:26
But there is no specific term in Desktop which is performing better on Desktop. And the example I am giving here is of a bakery website.
55:35
Maybe your website is a heavy machinery industry related website. Where a lot of users come from Desktop.
55:41
There are corporate users. Maybe there is a SaaS platform which runs on Desktop only. Maybe your website is related to an accounting software.
55:48
There a lot of your clientele will come from Desktop. There we have to see which user is coming from mobile.
55:54
After coming from mobile, what will the user search? If your SaaS platform is a website, an accounting software, a business related product or service, then most of the users should come from Desktop.
56:03
But if they are coming from mobile, it means they are sitting at home and searching in their free time. So what term are they using? So you can get answers to such unique questions from this tab.
56:12
So let's see, when a user is searching from Desktop, which query is searching more? So I have put a filter on Desktop.
56:18
After that it came to Query. I click on Impression again. Types of Cakes. People are searching for Types of Cakes more from Desktop.
56:25
So the page that we will make for Types of Cakes, will be more Desktop oriented. There will be more images.
56:31
There will be the functionality of zooming images. People want to see how many different types of cakes are there.
56:37
What is their quality? Is there detailing or not? Etc. So you can get answers to such unique questions.
56:44
When you go through these filters, a question should be framed in your mind. In fact, there are only two aims of this entire course.
56:54
Number one, to tell you the tool. And number two, to tell you how to get answers from the tool.
57:00
This Google Search Console is a tool for you. Now we will learn Analytics, we will learn Google Tag Manager, we will learn Screaming Frog, we will learn InLinks.
57:06
We will learn Analytics Canvas. We have to learn a lot of software. We have to learn a lot of tools. But how to get answers from those tools, it will depend on your creativity.
57:15
The difference will be there. Anyone can access this class. It is available for free on YouTube. But who will benefit from it?

It depends on your creativity and your own concept. And the purpose of these live classes is that you interact with me in real time.
57:32
You have a habit of asking questions. The things that I can't plan here right now, your questions tell me.
57:38
And there I will tell you some strategy or some trick that is necessary to find answers from your questions.
57:45
To develop your habit. So, do join the membership. Now, here we have seen the countries, we have seen the device, we have seen the search appearance, but we will not go there now.
57:55
We will go to another Search Console class and see the other website and explain there. Now, you can see the Discover button below.
58:01
This is related to Google Discover. I will leave it now. I will show it in the context of a news website.
58:07
Because it is not possible for this particular website to come in Discover. Neither will it target Discover.
58:13
It is a bakery website, why will it not target Discover? By the way, you can target any website in Discover. But it is a very small business.
58:19
They don't have a budget. They are not trying. It must have come sometime. If a website has never come in Discover, then it will not be shown in the options here.
58:26
If you can't see it, it's fine. This website must have come sometime 4-6-8 months ago, 1 year ago. That's why it is visible here.
58:33
I will put a filter of 16 months. Look, I got 2 clicks. Now, because of these 2 clicks, it is visible in the menu here.
58:39
But it is there. Right? Let's come back here. Now, let's come to the pages section.
58:45
We have seen the performance. There will be 2-4 more advanced classes. We will see them in the search console. Now, let's come to the indexing status.
58:51
Okay? What is indexing? I come here and search nidhastreet.ca This website automatically opens.
58:59
Okay? But I cut it from here. I come to Google. And I search for it.
59:05
Exactly. By the way, there is another way to search. You are on the search bar. You type site and then colon.
59:11
And then you paste the URL. So, all the pages of this website will be indexed by Google.
59:17
This is called site operator. The old ones know what it is. They must be laughing. But those who are new, understand this thing.
59:23
This is site operator. Right? With this, we find out how many pages of our website has been indexed by Google.
59:30
Now, you can't see the numbers here. You can't see the numbers because Google has become a little sneaky. You have to click on tools here. After clicking on tools, you will know that there are 123 results.
59:38
That means, Google has indexed 123 pages of https://nidhasstreet.ca instead of https://nidhasstreet.ca of this website.
59:48
But this number is ballpark. In the case of a small website, it can be accurate or not.
59:54
It can be 122 pages. It can be 125 pages. This is a ballpark number. This is never accurate.
