1:52
business, she decided to create an online presence by first setting up a blog. She began posting on her blog
1:59
regularly. However, even after regularly posting on the blog, there were barely any visitors showing up. Deciding not to
2:06
give up, Rachel began searching for a solution on the internet. That's when she came across SEO or search engine
2:13
optimization, a term she's never heard before. So, let's take a journey together and help her learn about SEO.
2:21
Search engine optimization is a method that could improve the quality and quantity of the audience coming to
2:26
Rachel's website from search engines. It could increase brand awareness, attract local customers, and build credibility
2:34
and trust. And all of this is possible without having to spend a single penny.
2:39
To bring visitors to her website, Rachel would have to take advantage of the two types of SEO, onpage and off-page SEO.
2:48
Rachel first decides to tackle onpage SEO and get that sorted. Onpage SEO
2:54
involved Rachel optimizing her website, both in terms of content and the technical aspects, including the HTML
3:00
source code, schema, metatags, and more. She started off by using tools like Google Adwords, Alref, and Semrush to
3:08
identify popular search terms associated with the recipes she planned to publish on her blog. She began to look for
3:14
search terms related to the broader area of baking, cooking, and related topics.
3:19
Once she found these search terms, she began to incorporate them into her recipes. She started off by providing an
3:26
introduction to the recipe. With this, she could provide an engaging beginning to her story, like how the dish reminded
3:32
her of her childhood and enabled her to naturally include the search terms into the blog. She also included these
3:39
keywords in the actual recipe as well. Additionally, she added pictures, videos, time-lapses, and more to
3:46
increase credibility and engagement for her content and subsequently persuading search engines to show her content to
3:53
more people. After this, she moved to the website meta content that search engines display when her blog appears in
3:59
search results. She optimized the meta tags, alt tags, header tags, and more.
4:05
This completed the on-page aspect of SEO. Thanks to this, she saw a significant increase in the number of
4:11
visitors coming to her page. Having done all she could on her web page, she now decides to explore what could be done
4:17
off-page to improve her page's visibility on search engines. Off-page SEO involved Rachel doing things outside
4:24
her site page to help increase its search engine rankings. Making optimizations outside the site would
4:31
improve the site's popularity, relevance, trustworthiness, and authority. This is possible with the
What Is SEO
4:37
help of reputable websites vouching for your content with backlinks, social media marketing, guest blogging, linked
4:44
unlin brand mentions, influencer marketing, and much more. Rachel also
4:50
understood that for her content to reach people, she would have to promote it on social media platforms like Facebook,
4:56
Twitter, and Instagram, as well as niche platforms like Kora, Reddit, and Medium.
5:01
These could help her achieve greater reach for her website by sending stronger social signals to search
5:06
engines, leading to the page being shown as highly relevant for related searches and audiences. And even after
5:14
understanding and implementing all of this, Rachel had just scratched the surface of what was possible with SEO.
5:21
Before we find out what she did next, let's have a look at a quiz. Which of the following is the most effective way
5:27
to improve off-page SEO? One, creating plenty of web pages of a content. Two,
5:34
getting back links from relevant and authoritative sites. Three, acquiring backlinks through link buying. four.
5:42
None of the above. Let us know your answer in the comments section below for a chance to win an Amazon voucher. Now,
5:49
let's go back to Rachel. Rachel decided to take up SimplyLearn's digital marketing certification. With classes
5:56
covering just about everything she needed to know about SEO, it was only a matter of time before Rachel began to
6:02
implement her learnings on her website and see a massive uptick in the number of viewers coming to her website. In
6:08
time, she could even earn money off the site by setting up an online shop. And with that, we've covered an introduction
6:15
to the concepts of SEO and the possibilities it can open for you, either as a marketer or a business
6:21
owner. Ever wondered how websites appear at the top of the search results when you type a query into Google? Well,
6:28
that's the magic of SEO. SEO stand for search engine optimization and it's the
6:34
process of fine-tuning your website to rank higher in organic that is unpaid search results. In simple terms, SEO is
6:42
all about making your websites more visible to people who are searching for the things online. When someone types a
6:49
question or a topic into search engine like Google, SEO helps your website appear higher up in the list of search
6:56
results. This means more people are likely to click on your website, just
7:01
like how you are more likely to visit the shops on the main street than those tucked away in an LA. Study shows that
7:09
organic search drives are whooping 53% of all website traffic. In fact, a
7:15
recent survey by Moz revealed that 61% of marketers consider SEO to be the most
7:20
effective digital marketing strategy. So in this video we will cover what is SEO,
7:26
types of SEO, how does SEO work, things to keep in mind while doing SEO. All
7:32
right. So let's start with the first topic which is what is SEO. Imagine you have a fantastic store but it's hidden
7:39
down a dark alley. SEO is like putting a bright lights and clear signs so people
7:45
can easily find you online. That's what SEO stands for. That is search engine
7:50
optimization. It's about making your website more visible in search engines like Google. When people search for
7:57
something, search engine use complex algorithms to rank websites. SEO helps your website tick the right boxes for
8:04
these algorithms. Good SEO means your website appears higher in search results which can lead to more visitors and
8:11
potential customers. It's like putting up the big sign outside your shop so more people know you are there. When
8:17
your website ranks higher in search results, it's like having a prime real estate in the digital world. Studies
8:23
shows that most people don't click past the first page of search results. So being at the toe can make a big
8:29
difference in how much traffic your site gets. SEO isn't just about getting more visitors, though. It's also about
8:35
attracting the right kind of visitors, people who are interested in what you offer and are more likely to become
8:41
customers or engage with your content. By understanding what people are searching for and optimizing your
8:46
website to match those queries, you can connect with your target audience more effectively. So this was about SEO. Now
8:53
let's understand about the three types of SEO. All right, there are three main types of SEO you need to know about.
8:59
First one is technical optimization. So this is like the backstage work of SEO. It involves doing things on your
9:05
websites that improve its performance in search engines but people don't see them. For example, submitting your
9:11
website sitemap to Google helps search engines understand and index your site better. The next one is onpage
9:18
optimization. This is about making sure that your content on your website is top-notch and relevant to what people
9:24
are searching for. You do this by using the right keywords in your content and providing a great user experience. It's
9:32
like making sure your website is likable and helpful to visitors. The next is
9:37
off-page optimization. So this type of SEO happens outside of your website. It's all about building your website's
9:43
reputation and authority on the internet. One big way to do this is by getting other reputable websites to link
9:49
to yours. These links called back links tell search engines that your website is
9:55
trustworthy and valuable. By understanding and working on these three types of SEO, you can boost your
10:02
website's visibility and attract more visitors, helping your business thrive online. So this was about the types of
10:08
SEO. Now let's understand how does SEO work. So basically there are some steps to how does SEO works. First search
10:15
engine crawling. Search engines like Google use automated programs called crawlers or spiders to browse the web.
10:22
So these crawlers follow links from one web page to another collecting information about each page they visit.
10:29
They gather data on the content structure and other elements of the web pages which is then stored in the search
10:35
engines database. Now next one is search engine indexing. Once the crawlers
10:40
collect information about web pages, the data is organized and stored in a massive database called an index. The
10:47
indexing process involves analyzing the content keywords, meta tags, and other factors to understand what each web page
10:54
is about. This index information allows search engines to quickly retrieve relevant results when someone performs a
11:00
search query. All right. Now, the third one which is search engine ranking. When a user enters a search query, the search
11:07
engines algorithms shift through the index pages to determine which ones are most relevant to the query. The
SEO for Beginners
11:13
algorithm considers various factors like keyword relevance, content quality, website authority, user experience, and
11:20
more to rank the pages. The pages that best matches the search query and meet the algorithms criteria appear higher in
11:27
the search engine results pages. Websites with strong SEO practices including optimized content quality,
11:33
back links, and user-friendly design are more likely to rank higher in search results. So in summary, SEO that is
11:38
search engine optimization boost a website's visibility online. We discussed three types. On page focuses
11:45
on content, off- page builds site authority and technical ensures smooth site operation. SEO involves
11:52
understanding how search engines find, organize, and rank websites. To succeed, maintain quality content, use relevant
11:59
keywords, and earn trustworthy backlinks. Regularly track performance to refine strategies. Remember, SEO is
12:05
an ongoing effort requiring adaptation to industry changes for sustained online success. Today, I'm talking about

24:56
today's video is just for you. We are diving deep into keyword research, a crucial part of any successful SEO
25:02
strategy. By the end of this tutorial, you'll know exactly how to find the right keywords to help your content
25:08
reach its full potential. So, let's get started. To kick off things first, let's
25:14
understand what keyword research is. Now, keyword research is all about discovering the exact phrases and terms
25:21
your potential audience is typing into search engines. Now, by identifying these keywords, you can create content
25:27
that directly addresses what people want to know, buy, or learn about. This not
25:33
only drives more visitors to your site, but also helps you connect with those who are most likely to engage with your
25:39
content. In essence, keyword research is the backbone of a strong SEO strategy,
25:45
guiding you in crafting content that resonates with your audience. Now that we know what keyword research is, let's
25:52
dive into why it's so important. Picture this. You're hosting a party. Would you
25:57
invite random people who might not even be interested? Or would you carefully choose guests who are excited to attend?
26:04
So, keyword research helps you do the latter by attracting the right guests to your website. When you know the exact
26:11
keywords your audience is searching for, you can tailor your content to meet their needs. This increases your chances
26:17
of not only driving more traffic, but also engaging visitors who are genuinely interested in what you have to offer.
26:23
The better you understand your audience search behavior, the more effective your content will be. Remember, it's not just
26:30
about quantity. Getting the right kind of traffic is key to conversions and overall success. Moving on, let's talk
26:37
about the different types of keywords you'll encounter in your research. This is important because not all keywords
26:43
are created equal and understanding the distinctions can greatly impact your strategy. So, short tail keywords are
26:50
broad and usually consist of one or two words like SEO or marketing. Now, these
26:56
keywords have high search volumes which means lots of people are searching for them. However, they're also highly
27:03
competitive, making it tough to rank for them unless you have a very authorative website. Next comes longtail keywords.
27:10
Now, longtail keywords on the other hand are more specific phrases like how to do
27:16
keyword research for SEO. Now, while they have lower search volumes, they tend to be less competitive and more
27:22
targeted, attracting visitors who are further along in their buyers journey. For instance, someone searches for best
27:29
budget laptops for students is likely closer to make a purchase than someone just searching for laptops. Now, next
27:36
type of keyword is LSI, which is Latin semantic indexing keywords. Now, these
27:41
are related terms that search engines consider relevant to your main keyword. Now, for example, if your main keyword
27:47
is digital marketing, then LSI keywords could be online marketing, SEO strategies or social media advertising.
27:54
Now even in this example if you have given best leather shoes the LSIs would be official and casual wear best
28:00
footwear brand urgent leather shoes etc. So using LSI keywords helps you create more contextually relevant content with
28:08
search engines favor. Now by balancing these types of keywords you can create content that appeals to both broad and
28:14
niche audiences giving your website a better chance to rank well across different searches. So all right, now
28:20
that we have covered the types of keywords, let's explore some of the tools that can help you find them. So
28:26
keyword research tools are like treasure maps. They guide you to the keywords that can drive the most traffic to your
28:31
website. Number one is Google keyword planner. So Google keyword planner is a fantastic starting point, especially for
28:38
beginners. It's free and provides a wealth of information, including search volumes and competition levels for
28:44
various keywords. You can also discover new keyword ideas based on what people are already searching for. Next is
28:51
ahrefs. Ahres is a more advanced paid tool that offers in-depth analysis. It
28:57
doesn't just give you keyword data. It also provides insights into how difficult it is to rank for a particular
29:02
keyword as well as clickthrough rates, CTR, and related keyword ideas. So, ASF
29:08
is particularly useful for competitor analysis, helping you see which keywords for your competitors are ranking for and
29:14
identifying gaps in their content that you can exploit. Now, next comes SEM Rush. Now, SEM Rush is another powerful
29:21
tool that goes beyond keyword research. It offers comprehensive data on keywords, including trends over time,
29:28
and allows you to conduct competitive analysis, track keyword performance, and more. SEM Rush is a go-to for many SEO
29:36
professionals because of its all-in-one capabilities. So, these tools simplify the process of keyword research,
29:42
allowing you to focus on creating content that will resonate with your audience and perform well in search engine results. So, with so many tools
29:49
at your disposal, the next step is figuring out how to actually find the best keywords for your content. So,
29:55
here's a step-by-step approach. Number one, start with a brainstorming session.
30:01
So you can list down potential keywords related to your topic. Think about what your audience might search for and
30:07
consider different variations of those phrases. So use the keyword research tools we just discussed to analyze these
30:14
keywords. Pay close attention to search volume, competition, and user intent.
30:19
The goal is to find keywords that have a good search volume but aren't too competitive. And next, consider user
30:25
intent. This is crucial. Ask yourself, what is a searcher hoping to find? If someone is searching for best travel
30:31
laptops in 2024, they're probably looking for product reviews or recommendations. Tailor your content to
30:38
meet that specific intent and you'll have a much better chance of converting those visitors into customers. So, by
30:44
following these steps, you can pinpoint the keywords that will not only drive traffic, but also ensure that the
30:50
traffic is relevant and likely to convert. Now, one of the most effective ways to find highquality keywords is by
30:55
analyzing your competitors. This might sound like a spy mission, but it's completely above board and incredibly
31:01
valuable. So, tools like SEM Rush allow you to see which keywords your competitors are ranking for. So, this
31:07
gives you insight into what's working for them and more importantly, it highlights gaps in their strategy that
31:13
you can exploit. For instance, if you notice that a competitor is ranking well for a keyword like affordable SEO tools,
31:20
but their content is outdated or lacking in detail, you can create a more comprehensive and up-to-date piece to
31:25
outrank them. So by leveraging competitor insights, you can stay ahead in the SEO game, ensuring that your
31:31
content is always relevant and competitive. Now, finding the right keywords is only half the battle. The
31:37
next challenge is using them effectively in your content. So here's how you can do that. Number one, place your primary
31:44
keywords in strategic locations such as title, meta description, headers, and throughout the content. This signals to
31:51
search engines that your content is about, helping you rank for that keyword. Number two, avoid keyword
31:57
stuffing. This old school tactic doesn't work anymore and can actually hurt your rankings. Instead, focus on naturally
32:04
integrating keywords and using variations. For example, if your primary keyword is digital marketing strategy,
Keyword Research Tutorial
32:10
you could also use online marketing strategy or effective digital marketing tactics to make your content more
32:16
readable and engaging. Now, the third one is using LSI keywords to add depth and context to your content. This not
32:23
only improves readability but also helps search engines understand the broader topic of your content which can
32:28
positively impact your rankings. Remember the goal is to create content that's both optimized for search engines
32:35
and enjoyable for your readers. Lastly, keyword research is not a set it and forget it process. It requires regular
32:41
monitoring and adjustment. SEO is a constantly evolving field and what works today might not work tomorrow. So, make
32:48
it a habit to regularly check how your keywords are performing. Use tools like Google Analytics to track your rankings
32:54
and see which keywords are driving the most traffic. If you notice that certain keywords are underperforming, consider
33:00
tweaking your content or trying out new keywords. So, by staying on top of your keyword strategy, you can ensure that
33:07
your content continues to perform well and adapt to changes in search trends. And there you have it, a comprehensive
33:13
guide to keyword research. I hope you found this tutorial helpful and that you are now ready to start finding the best

What Is Google Ads
34:07
looking to connect with the right audience at the right time. A Google Ads campaign helps businesses reach
34:12
potential customers online by displaying targeted ads across Google's vast network, including search results,
34:18
YouTube, and partner websites. Advertisers set a budget, choose a campaign objective, and create ads that
34:25
are shown to specific audiences based on keywords, demographics, and interests. The campaign operates on a pay-per-click
34:32
model, meaning you only pay when someone clicks on your ad, making it an effective way to attract interested
34:38
customers and achieve your marketing goals. So, in this video, we are going to walk you through everything you need
34:43
to know to get started with Google Ads. We'll cover how to create a campaign from scratch, set your budget, and
34:49
choose the right bidding strategy. We'll also dive into targeting options to ensure your ads reach the right
34:54
audience. And we'll show you how to craft compelling ads that drive results. By the end of this video, you'll have
35:00
the knowledge and confidence to launch your own successful Google Ads campaign. So, let's get started. So, to kick off
35:06
our Google Ads campaign, we'll start by creating a new campaign. So, once you're logged into your Google Ads account,
35:12
begin by clicking the blue plus new campaign button. So, here you're presented with a list of campaign
35:18
objectives. Now, choosing the right objective is crucial because it guides Google Ads on how to optimize your
35:24
campaign. So, let's see one by one. The first objective is sales. So this is perfect for businesses looking to drive
35:31
direct conversions whether it's online purchases, phone orders or inerson sales. So for instance, if you run an
35:38
e-commerce store, this objective will help you target users who are ready to buy. So Google will prioritize showing
35:45
your ads to people most likely to complete a transaction based on their behavior or intent. So this makes it
35:50
ideal for businesses focused on generating immediate revenue. So you can use this when your primary goal is to
35:56
turn clicks into sales, making it perfect for businesses with clear purchase parts like online stores or
36:02
service providers. Now next we have the leads objective. So this is designed for
36:07
businesses that want to gather contact information from potential customers such as through form submissions, phone
36:13
calls or signups. So for example, imagine you are a real estate agent aiming to build a list of potential home
36:19
buyers. So by selecting the leads objective, Google ads will optimize your campaign to reach users likely to fill
36:26
out your contact form or call your office. Now next is website traffic. Now this is the objective you'll want to
36:32
choose if your main goal is to drive more visitors to your website. So this is particularly useful for increasing
36:37
brand awareness or getting people to explore your products and services online. Like for instance, if you're a
36:43
blogger or a content creator. So this objective will help you attract visitors to your site to engage with your
36:49
articles, videos or any other content that you put up. So now next comes app promotion. So this is when you have
36:54
created an app like for example uh you know an online gaming app or anything and you want more installs or downloads.
37:02
Now next you have awareness and consideration. So it is designed for businesses that want to engage users and
37:07
engage them to think about their products or services. So this is especially effective in introducing something new to the market. And then
37:13
you have local shop visits and promotions. And then you can also create a campaign without a goals guidance.
37:19
Okay. So here we are planning to give an example for lead generation like how to generate lead for an a free online
37:25
course provider. So let's select leads and continue. Now as we have selected an
37:30
objective which is generating leads. The next step is to choose your campaign type. So there are several campaign types like Google ads offers several
37:37
types but the two most common are search and display ads. So anyways, let's start
37:42
with the search ads. So these are the text based ads that appear at the top of the Google search results when someone
37:48
searches for keywords related to your business. Like for example, let's see, let's just see car rentals near me. So
37:56
your ad could appear like this like as you can see the sponsored ads. So your ads could appear at the top of the
38:01
search results. So this is highly effective for capturing high intent users. So people who are actively
38:06
looking for what you offer. Now next we have display ads. So these are visually engaging ads that appear across the
38:12
Google display network like which includes websites like the ads basically the ads you see in others websites apps
38:18
or even YouTube. So now display ads are perfect for building awareness and keeping your brand top of mind. So they
38:24
work well for retargeting like showing your ads to people who have previously visited your website but didn't take any
38:31
action. Now the next one is shopping ads. Now shopping ads are a powerful tool for e-commerce websites. So these
38:37
ads showcase your products directly in the search results complete with images, prices, and your studio. Like for
38:43
example, if we search leather jackets, just a
38:52
second. Leather jacket. Yeah. So your shopping ad could appear displaying a product image, price, and a link to
38:58
purchase directly from your website as you can see here. So this makes it easy for potential customers to see what
39:04
you're offering and click through to buy. So shopping ads are ideal if you're looking to drive sales of physical products providing a visual direct part
39:11
to purchase. Then we have video ads which is another impactful way to reach your audience especially on platform.
39:16
Video ads you can create engaging content that appear before during or other videos on YouTube. So this is
39:22
basically the videos like the ad videos that you see like while watching your YouTube video. And then we have
39:27
performance max campaign. So this type uses Google's machine learning to optimize your ads across all Google
39:32
properties like including search, display, YouTube, Gmail, etc. So performance max campaigns are perfect
39:38
when you want to maximize your results without managing multiple campaign type separately. So Google's algorithms will
39:44
automatically find the best combination of ad formats and placements to meet your objectives. So right now we'll
39:50
select the search campaign type and we want like we'll be giving lead form submissions and let's press continue and
39:56
let's just keep like lead search. So now that we have selected our campaign type the next step is to set
40:03
your budget and bidding strategy. So this is crucial as it determines how much you're willing to spend and how
40:09
Google ads will manage your bids. So now for bidding since our objective in this demo is to generate leads we'll choose
40:15
conversions. So this strategy lets Google automatically set your bids to get the most conversions within your
40:21
budget. So now you can set a target cost per action. So this budget is the amount you're comfortable spending per action.
40:28
So like you can just give 0.3 rupees you know per action and let's press next.
40:34
Now next let's define our targeting options. So this step is about deciding who will see your ads, where they will
40:40
see them and when. So you can target users by location. As you can see all countries in teries, India or any other
40:47
location you have options. So for example, if your store is in Delhi, you might want to target only people within a 50 mile radius. Now, additionally, you
40:54
can also refine your audience based on demographics such as age, gender, and household income. So this ensures your
41:00
ads reach the most relevant relevant customers. And you can also select the languages that your you know customers
41:08
speak like you can give English, you can give uh Hindi. So you can select
41:13
multiple languages that your target audiences speak and also you can you know select the audience segments like
41:20
what your audience might be doing. So like for example we are actually you know giving this example for lead generation for a free online course
41:27
provider. So what we do is we can actually like our audience will be students right. So we can give students
41:35
yeah you can give current university students and this is also for working professionals. So you can give
41:44
working, education, jobs, IT and technical. So you can select who your target audience are. So effective
41:50
targeting is crucial for maximizing your ad spend. So take the time to consider who your ideal customers are. Now let's
41:57
go to next. So now next is selecting keywords. So for search ads, keywords are the backbone of your campaign. So
42:03
these are the words or phrases users type into Google when looking for products or services like yours. So
42:09
choose keywords that are closely related to your business. So for example, we are actually looking for lead generation for
42:15
this particular website which is simply learn skill website that provides free online courses. So first you have to
42:22
give the final URL and then you have to enter your keywords. You can also you know type in the products or services
42:28
like you advertise like the co's name and everything and you can enter the keywords. Now you can take the help of
42:33
Google's keyword planner for keyword ideas and see how often they are searched. So let's just go to keyword
42:39
planner discover new keywords. So now here you have to enter the products or services closely related to your
42:45
business. So here I'll just type online sorry free online
42:55
course digital marketing. So you can give so many keywords. Okay. And let's
43:01
give get results. So now these are the keywords that are suggested by the keyword planner. So what you can do is
43:07
you can just select the keywords like you can select so many multiple keywords you can copy it you can paste it here.
43:15
So this is a demo that's why I've just taken you know three to four keywords but in fact you have to use more keywords. So now you have selected your
43:21
keywords now it's time to create your ad. So your ad copy includes the headline, description and display URL.
43:28
So this is what users will see in the search results or across the display network. So basically in your ad. So
43:33
making it engaging and relevant. So first you can give the URL of your
43:39
website. So in the headline you can grab the attention by highlighting your key offerings and including one of your main
43:44
keywords. Like for example you can give master digital marketing and you can get
43:52
like you have to fill at least three headlines. So you can get free
43:58
digital course or you can give best and you can even fill more
44:05
headlines. Now you can use the description. So this is the description part. So you can use a description to
44:10
expand on your offer. So like you can highlight unique selling points of yours like expert instructors. For example,
44:17
you can give expert instructors
44:22
sorry or flexible learning or like endor to boost
44:29
your career etc. So once you have done this let's go to next. Now this shows
44:34
your budget. So as you can see we had given like 0.244 cost per conversion. So your
44:41
weekly cost will be 50,000. So here you can see the budget. Now the final step
44:46
is before we launch it's important to review all the details. Now Google ads will show you a summary of your campaign
44:52
settings including your budget, targeting keywords and ad copy. So you can double check. So next is the review.
44:59
So here you can double check everything to ensure it aligns with your objective. So this will take some time. So select
45:05
once you're satisfied you can publish your campaign. So your ads will start running shortly and you can monitor the
45:10
performance in real time through dashboard. Google tag manager. Thanks for joining and let's get started with
45:16
this simply learn webinar. So let's start out with YGTM. So let's just say
45:22
you're Sam and you have your own ecommerce website and you want to
45:27
understand how people are interacting with your website. Well Sam, today's
45:32
world of websites contain a lot of interactivity. everything from videos to
45:38
PDF downloads to commenting to form submissions
45:44
uh to all sorts of chat functionality interactivity going on throughout the
45:49
website. So there's just a lot that you need to track outside of just page
45:54
views. And so really what GTM does is they help you track all these things I
46:01
just mentioned. everything from somebody clicking on the play button of a PDF to somebody clicking on the submit button
46:07
of a form to somebody entering in something on a chat function. So that's
46:12
what GTM is. So why GTM? Because it helps us track all that interactivity. So all GTM is is really allows you to
46:21
really place a piece of Java code which is just script and this script that's
46:26
added to a web page to collect information. So that's really what a tag is. It's just some script that gets put
46:34
on a web page in order for you to collect information like page views, clicks, etc. And they send it to
46:41
third-party tools. Okay, so that's what GTM does. It it basically allows you to
46:47
take all these tags that collect information and you can use them in GTM.
46:53
So if you want to, for example, collect how many people, you know, enter a chat
47:01
functionality and start chatting, well, you're going to take that script and you're going to put it in GTM. And GTM
47:08
will then allow you to start tracking that information. So that's really what GTM is. It just allows you to put tags
47:14
into a container or think of it as a toy box. You have all these toys and you want to track. Well, you can put all
47:20
those those toys or tags in a toy box or container. And we're going to talk a little bit more about that. But before
47:27
we get into GTM, let's just say, you know, you're communicating with your developer and there's a new user request
47:35
on your web page and you want to update the tag. Well, your developer
47:40
considering it's probably a small update to your website, is probably going to
47:45
not um hesitate and is going to go ahead and turn around and do it normally. And
47:51
so, normally what happens is the developer is going to go to the website and update the tag. Well, what if you
47:56
have a few things that you want to track? All those things I mentioned before from downloads to clicks to, you
48:03
know, somebody checking out to watching a video. Well, your web master, your web
48:08
developer is going to go, well, hold on a second. Now, all these requests are going to take time. I need to put them
48:14
into the work queue, so to speak. Well, what happens is when they go into work,
48:19
usually it's going to take some time. And in some cases, you as a marketer
48:25
need to launch a campaign. And you want to get that tracking uh added to the website in time for the campaign launch.
48:32
So, you want to go ahead and quickly turn around the tracking for that particular campaign. Let's just say
48:37
you're launching a campaign and you're sending people to a landing page that has a form submission and you want to be
48:43
able to track how many people click on the submit button of that form submission. Well, if you need to turn that around, your developer is like,
48:49
"Well, I need to put that in a work queue." The timing isn't going to always work out between you and your developer
48:54
is my point. And so, that's where GTM comes in because there is a solution.
49:00
update your tags faster. And that's Google Tag Manager. So when we say GTM,
49:06
that's what GTM stands for. Google Tag Manager. It's a place for you to add tags quickly and easily. So tags,
49:14
remember, are just snippets of code that allow you to track things on your website interactivity
49:20
interactivity. And basically, when you have GTM, you can bypass the web master
49:26
and do it quickly and easily. So that's what GTM is all about. So why GTM?
49:31
Because we just identified two benefits. One, you could track all the interactivity on your website and two,
49:38
you can bypass your web developer or web master. And so that's the benefit of
49:43
GTM. So the benefit, you get those tags updated very quickly via Google Tag
49:50
Manager. Okay, so that's what tag manager is. So, what we're going to talk about today is specifically what Tag
49:58
Manager is and what it does. We're going to list some of the benefits of Tag Manager. We're going to show you how it
50:03
works and then we're going to show you how to get started with Tag Manager. Tag Manager, if you're not familiar with
50:10
working with web masters and dealing with JavaScript and tags and all this jargon is just new to you today, okay,
50:17
well, don't fret. Sit back. We're going to take it slow. This is an introduction into Google Tag Manager. Again, let's
50:24
start out with what is Tag Manager. So, we've already introduced it to some degree because we already introduced as
50:30
a tool where you can put all your tags into a toolbox, toy box or container, so
50:37
to speak, right? And we already mentioned that, hey, you can bypass your web master. So, you're probably thinking, well, if I'm if you're not
50:43
familiar with Tag Manager, how can I bypass my web master? Well, first of all, it's a free tool and it's a Google
50:49
tool, hence the name Google Tag Manager. And it helps you really, that's the main point is deploy and track tags on your
50:56
website bypassing your web master. So that's Tag Manager. And so examples of
51:01
tags that can be deployed via Google Tag Manager are numerous. These are just
51:07
some examples like Google Analytics, Facebook's pixel tracking, or Google Ads. There's no limit into the number of
51:15
tags you can track in tag manager. There is no limit. You can add any number of
51:21
tracking tags in tag manager. Okay, so some of the benefits. Well, again I we
51:26
just listed two. You can put any tag into tag manager and track that onto
51:32
your website and we know you can bypass your web developer or web master. And what it also does is it also allows you
51:39
to test and deploy your JavaScript codes quicker. So remember these JavaScript
51:45
codes or snippets of codes are just there to track certain things on your
51:50
website whether that be a page view or somebody clicking on a play button or
51:55
tracking somebody who converts or even just goes to your website. So the biggest benefit is you can take that
52:01
snippet of code. Let's just say Facebook. Let's just say you're doing Facebook marketing and you want to put
52:07
that Facebook pixel on your website so that you could track people who come from Facebook and convert. Well, you
52:13
don't need to put that Facebook pixel on your website. You can go right to Tag Manager and you can put that snippet of
52:19
code right in Tag Manager really quickly. And the the other benefit here
52:25
is all tags are managed in one place. And that's that to me is really a good benefit because when you start adding
52:30
tags on your website and you have some tags in tag manager, it just gets very confusing. So ideally all the tracking
52:38
code you have on your website needs to be in tag manager. Think about that. All the tracking. So if you're doing Bing or
52:44
you're doing Facebook or you're doing Twitter or you're doing LinkedIn and you're doing Google, you're doing all this type of marketing on all these
52:52
different platforms, you're going to have tracking code for all these different platforms. And instead of putting all that code on your website,
52:59
return going to slow down the slow load time of your web page and website, you want to put them all in tag manager so
53:05
they can be organized and you know exactly what you're trying to track. And the other great benefit of tag manager
53:11
is there's a versioning control. So let's just say you have added tags to
53:16
your website via GTM for the last 6 months. Well, and let's just say you add
53:21
another tag yesterday. If you added that tag yesterday and something doesn't work, well, you can just roll back to a
53:27
previous version. It's that simple. So, you have versioning and that's that's a good thing. When you have versioning,
53:33
you can control what gets published. And if something doesn't work after it gets published, then you can roll back to a
53:38
previous version. So, it's a a piece of mind, so to speak. Just because you've add code to your site, there's no
53:44
guarantee it's going to work. And so, you can always control what version you're dealing with in Tag Manager. And
53:50
we'll talk a little bit more about that. So the biggest benefit here to me with tag manager is you have event tracking.
53:57
And so we talked about some of the things you could track on your website from videos from play buttons to
54:04
somebody clicking on the stop on the video or pausing it all the way to somebody again chatting or let's just
54:12
say somebody clicking on that purchase button on your website. Okay? And you want to track all these different
54:17
things, these different interactivities and buttons. Well, event tracking is
54:22
what you're going to use to track all those buttons. And to me, this is the biggest benefit of Tag Manager. And I'll
54:29
show you some examples as we go along. And if we didn't mention it already, I'll mention it again. It is free. Tag
54:35
Manager is free. There's no limit. So once you have Tag Manager going, you can add as many tracking codes as you want.
54:41
There's no limit on the number of tracking codes you can add to Tag Manager. Okay? So it's free and you can
54:48
use it to its fullest advantage. Okay? So, it's also high security, meaning that it has different levels of
54:54
permissions. Okay? So, you can have uh somebody just go in and look at the
54:59
different tags and tracking codes you have in GTM or you can have somebody who is very familiar with tag manager and
55:06
can go in and add the tracking code to tag manager and then publish that tracking code when it gets added. So,
55:11
those are all the benefits. Let's talk about how it works. Now, specifically, how does Tag Manager work? because
55:18
you're like, Rob, okay, again, a lot of jargon, you know, you you got tags and
55:23
JavaScript and and versioning and publishing and all this other stuff. Well, I know I'm throwing a lot at you
55:29
at once, but just bear with me here, okay? So, let's start talking about how it actually works. So, you have a
55:37
website, okay? Whatever that domain is, you have a website. And there's chances are on your website you have some form
55:44
of interactivity, whether that be a video, whether that be a blog, whether it be a form submission, you have a
55:50
website with some interactivity. And let's just say you're even thinking about getting ready to launch some type
55:56
of campaign on maybe Google or Facebook and you want to drive traffic to your website. Fair enough. You're joining the
56:02
millions of other websites that are out there that have interactivity that also drive traffic to the website. So, in
56:08
comes Google Tag Manager. And so tag manager is important because again we know we want to track people coming from
56:14
that Facebook campaign or that Google campaign interacting with our site. So if you are running Facebook and you are
56:22
running Google Analytics, well guess what you want to put that tracking code
56:27
in tag manager. So Google Analytics being a Google product works very nicely
56:32
with tag manager. Facebook has its own tracking code and but you still want to be able to track people who come from
56:38
the Facebook campaign to your website. So you're going to get that tracking code from Facebook and put it in tag
56:44
manager. That's generally how it works. So here information from your website is
56:49
shared with another data source through tag manager. So think about that. If I add Facebook tracking code to tag
56:56
manager or let's just say I add Google Analytics tracking code to tag manager, tag manager is the one that's pushing
57:03
out and doing all the heavy lifting. They're the ones that are controlling what code gets fired and what code
57:09
doesn't. So if you're putting the code in Tag Manager, Tag Manager is controlling the code. Think about it that way. And let's show you an example
57:16
of what that looks like. So here I am. I'm in Tag Manager. I just went to tag manager.google.com
57:21
google.com. And here I could see a list of tags. So in our conversation, we're
57:27
talking about tracking Facebook and we're talking about tracking Google Analytics. Well, Google Analytics is
57:32
easy because it's a Google product. So here, if I look at all the different tracking code I have on my website
57:39
through Tag Manager, let's just take a look at Google Analytics. So if you're going to use Tag Manager, you might as
57:46
well put the Google Analytics code in here. So here I can see I have Google Analytics as a tag in tag manager. Now
57:54
for Facebook, if I'm running a Facebook campaign, well I can take that pixel tracking and put it in GTM as well. And
58:01
here I can see Facebook pixel. That is that code is added to GTM. I just
58:07
basically took what Facebook gave me and put it into Google Tag Manager. So you
58:12
can see I can add Facebook and Google Analytics. And again, I can't stress it
58:17
enough. Any tracking code from any platform, I can add to Google Tag
58:23
Manager in order to track the behavior from those sources. So, let's take a little bit deeper dive into how Tag
58:31
Manager works. So, I just showed you an example of how you could take Facebook and Google Analytics code and put it
58:36
into Tag Manager. But if you're not familiar with Tag Manager, then how do I do that? Well, let's talk about the
58:43
structure and how Tag Manager works. So when you have a tag manager account, you have a container. Remember I mentioned
58:50
toy box earlier. You have a bunch of toys. If they're they're code and you're
58:55
tracking different bits of code from different platforms like Facebook, think of those as toys and you have a toy box.
59:01
Okay? Well, that's what this code is. And that's what a container is. The code is the code and that's going to go into
59:07
the toy box or container. And so the way tag manager works is you have tags,
59:12
triggers, and variables. So, if I take my Facebook tracking code and put it into a container, I need to set up a tag
59:20
and a trigger. Okay. So, let's take a look at what that is. So, first, if I go back to tag manager, I'm going to have
59:26
an account. And if I have an account, I'm going to have a container. So, here I'm just going to click on an account
59:33
with a container. And a container is nothing more than what website you're adding the tracking code to. Okay,
59:40
that's all the container is. We're just letting Tag Manager know this is the website we're adding all this code to.
59:47
So you have tags, triggers, and variables. That's the structure of tag
59:52
manager. So tags are just what it says, tags. What are we trying to quote
59:58
unquote tag? Well, if it's Google Analytics, that's easy. Here I could see I have Google Analytics added. So if I
1:00:05
click on Google Analytics, here's my tag. And if I take a little bit of a deeper dive there, since Google
1:00:13
Analytics is a Google product, it integrates already with tag managers. It's pretty easy. I can just choose
1:00:19
Google Analytics. Then I'm going to check page view. And that's my tag. Now,
1:00:25
every tag needs a trigger. Okay. So, I need to tell Tag Manager how or when to
1:00:32
fire the Google Analytics tracking code. So in this case, I'm going to tell Tag Manager to fire on all pages. So if I
1:00:41
get somebody a visitor to my website, Analytics is firing on all pages. So whatever page that visitor lands on,
1:00:48
Google Analytics is going to fire. So that's really what it comes down to is I have a tag and I need to tell Tag
1:00:55
Manager when to trigger that tag. That's really what the structure of Tag Manager
1:01:02
is. It's tags, triggers, and variables. And variables, what we're going to talk about here in a couple minutes. But you
1:01:08
have a piece of code. You're going to go ahead and put that into tag manager. You're going to tag it, and then you're
1:01:14
going to fire that trigger. So, let's take a look at another example here. If I go back here, you can see Facebook.
1:01:21
Well, here's my Facebook pixel. Okay, that's my tag. So, when is it going to fire? Well, it's going to fire on a
1:01:28
specific domain or subdomain. That's basically what we're doing. We're trying to tell GTM when to fire that particular
1:01:36
tag. So those are the three main components. A tag, okay, which is going
1:01:41
to contain the JavaScript code that you get from say Facebook. The trigger. So
1:01:48
you're going to go into tag manager and tell tag manager when to fire that code. That's the trigger. And then you have
1:01:54
variables. And so variables are basically just additional information
1:02:00
that tag manager may need for your tag and trigger to work. So that's what a variable is. It's there to get the tag
1:02:07
and trigger to fire. So variables are divided into builtin and userdefined
1:02:13
variables. So common used variables include say page path or page URL or
1:02:18
host name or click class. Again, they're there. And these examples I just gave
1:02:24
you are there to get your tag and trigger to work. Think about it that way. They're just that's a component.
1:02:30
And if I go into tag manager here and here on the left side, I can see variables. So remember, I have builtin
1:02:37
and userdefined. So builtin means that tag manager already built these for me.
1:02:43
So in case I need to get my trigger to work with my tag, I can use a variable.
1:02:50
So those are built in and then I have userdeed. So these are what I define. These are what I created. And again, the
1:02:57
variables are there to get the tag and trigger to work. Okay, so that's the job of the variable. The job of the tag is
1:03:04
to host that JavaScript code. Okay, in the case of Facebook or analytics,
1:03:10
that's where we're putting our code. So here if I click on Adwords remarketing again it's a Google product so I don't
1:03:16
really need to even deal with code. I'm just going to select Google AdWords remarketing. Okay. So you could see GTM
1:03:24
integrates nicely with some of the other Google products. But let's just say you
1:03:29
have a Facebook pixel tracking code. You're going to choose custom and you're going to put the code here. So that's
1:03:35
part of the tag. And then the trigger again is there to get the tag to fire. So you're telling GTM when to fire the
1:03:42
tag and the variable is there to help you make sure that that trigger and that
1:03:48
tag work together. So that's how all three kind of work together. You need the tag to put the code. You need the
1:03:55
trigger to tell GTM when to fire the tag and code and the variables there to help
1:04:00
you define when that tag and trigger should work or how it should work. So again, review tags are they're just
1:04:07
small codes of JavaScript or tracking pixels on your website. And so tags are allowed to manage events like scroll
1:04:13
tracking, remarketing, clicks, downloads, files, play buttons, you name it. Even clicks on external links. For
1:04:20
example, let's just say you have a click uh or a Facebook uh icon on your site.
1:04:25
And when somebody clicks on it, they go to Facebook. You want to maybe track that. You're going to create a tag. Okay, the trigger is there because you
1:04:32
need to tell GTM when to fire that tag. So it's a certain condition whether
1:04:38
it's, you know, fire the tag if the URL equals facebook.com or some other
1:04:44
condition. So the tag cannot be created until the creation of the corresponding
1:04:49
trigger. So tags and triggers go together. You can't just create a tag and not have a trigger. Otherwise, your
1:04:56
tag will never fire. And then the variable is there again. It stores the information when defining a trigger or
1:05:02
transferring data to tag. So a variable has a variety of data. Okay? So you pick
1:05:08
and choose the variable you want to use with that trigger. Okay? So you're making sure that by defining a variable,
1:05:15
you're making sure that you're telling GTM how that trigger should be fired. So
1:05:20
let's take a look at another example here of how all three play together. If I'm in this account, I'm in this
1:05:27
container. If I look down here, I could see Google Optimize. That's another Google product. So, what I'm doing here
1:05:35
is I just chose Google Optimize as my tag. It's already integrated. So, what
1:05:40
does that mean? I don't even need to deal with any code. I'm just going to select optimize. Well, we have the tag
1:05:47
Google Optimize, but we need to tell GTM how to fire that. And so, here we're
1:05:53
going to tell GTM to fire it on all pages. So that's basically a very simple
1:05:58
example because we're firing it on all pages. So if I want to look at something specific again, Facebook, here's my tag.
1:06:06
Here's my code. What's my trigger? Well, my trigger is it's going to fire on
1:06:12
specific pages. How do I know that? Well, if I look at the trigger here, I
1:06:17
could see the trigger is a page view, but I'm telling it to fire on this
1:06:23
particular host name. So the tag and trigger go hand in [Music]
1:06:41
hand. So how to get started with Tag Manager. So first things first, you have
1:06:47
to create that account. So you're going to go to tagmanager.google.com google.com or you can do a search for
1:06:54
Google Tag Manager and you're going to create your account. And then when you create your account, what's going to
1:06:59
happen is you're going to set up a container. And when you set up a
1:07:04
container, you have choices. So you could set it up for your website, for an
1:07:10
app on iOS, or maybe Android, or you can even set it up for AMC an accelerated
1:07:17
mobile page. So most people by default are probably going to set up Tag Manager
1:07:22
for their website. And so when you do that, when you actually select website, what's going to happen is you're going
1:07:29
to get some Google Tag Manager code in return. And so the whole idea here is
1:07:35
you're going to do a swap. What you're doing is basically you're saying, "Okay, Google, I'm going to take this Google
1:07:41
Tag Manager code and I'm going to put it on my website. I'm going to put it on every page of my website." So notice tag
1:07:48
manager has two scripts. One goes in the head as high as possible. The other goes
1:07:55
into the body tag as high as possible. And so what you're doing is you're making a deal. You're putting this tag
1:08:01
manager code on your website. And in return, every code you deal with,
1:08:06
whether that be Facebook or analytics or optimize or remarketing or whatever it is, is going to go in GTM. Okay? It's
1:08:13
going to go into the container you created. So, you need the tag manager code on your website in order for tag
1:08:21
manager to work. Okay? So, when you add this code to your website, then you're free to start adding all sorts of tags
1:08:28
to your container. But if you don't have this tracking code on your website, then none of the tags you add to your
1:08:35
container are going to work. So, that's the idea behind the container. And then one thing I wanted to mention on the
1:08:42
account is it's a Google account. So when you create your account then make sure it's the same account you use with
1:08:48
say Google Analytics or some other Google product. That's a good best practice is always use the same email
1:08:55
address when you set up your account so that it integrates nicely across all the
1:09:00
different platforms. Meaning you can go from say Google Analytics right to Google Tag Manager in one browser
1:09:06
without having to log out or login. Okay. So when you create the account you're going to create your container.
1:09:11
If you choose web, then you're going to be asked to place code on your website. And when you place that code on your
1:09:17
website, then you are free to start using tag manager. And that means you're
1:09:22
free to start adding tags. So if you want to know more information about installing Google Tag Manager, then what
1:09:30
I would recommend is visit the quick start guide website of GTM. So again, if
1:09:35
you're curious as to where that code is located in Google Tag Manager, well,
1:09:40
when you create an account and you create a container, that container is going to have a specific ID. So if I
1:09:47
click on that specific ID, here's where I can get my code. Okay, so again, when
1:09:53
I'm logged in to Tag Manager, I'm going to click on workspace, but in the top
1:09:58
navigation, I'm going to see my unique GTM ID. If I click on that, that's where
1:10:04
my code is going to be located. And so again, your code needs to go in the header. And there's another script that
1:10:10
needs to go in the body. And if you're not sure how to add the code to your website, well, you can always click on
1:10:16
the quick start guide here. Okay? And that'll take you to a quick start guide
1:10:21
page, a reference page related to Google Tag Manager. So let's talk about
1:10:26
creating a tag. So once you get Tag Manager installed, I'm sure you're excited to get going and create that
1:10:34
first tag. So let's talk about how to create a tag in Tag Manager. So when
1:10:40
you're in Tag Manager, all you need to do is basically you're looking at all
1:10:45
your tags. If you click on tag in the left side navigation, you'll see all your tags and there's a new button
1:10:51
there. So you just click new. And so basically what you're going to do is you're going to create your first tag.
1:10:58
And so what I would recommend once you get tag manager installed on your website, I would recommend setting the
1:11:06
first tag up as Google Analytics. So that will get you going with tracking
1:11:11
page views on your website when some when somebody visits your website. Okay? So ideally that's what you want to do.
1:11:18
You want to get Google Analytics as your first tag and tag manager. So, what I'm
1:11:23
going to do is because Analytics is a Google product, it's already integrated nicely with Tag Manager. So, I'm just
1:11:30
going to click on Google Analytics. It's going to be a page view. That's what I'm tracking. And now I have to set up a
1:11:37
variable. And so, what it's going to do, it's going to ask me to set select a
1:11:42
variable. And so, what you're going to do is you're going to select new variable. And what you're going to do is
1:11:47
you're actually going to go and add your tracking ID here. That's going to be your variable. So, where do I get my
1:11:54
tracking ID in analytics? Well, if I'm in analytics, I'm going to go to admin
1:11:59
and then under property settings, I'm going to see my tracking ID. And all you need to do then is go to tag manager and
1:12:06
paste. Copy. First, you got to copy over that tracking ID. Then, you're going to go to tag manager and paste it. And then
1:12:12
that's going to create a variable for you. And then when you create that variable, you're going to see it in the dropdown here. So, I've already created
1:12:19
it. And basically that's your tag with a variable. Then what are you going to do?
1:12:25
You're going to set up a trigger. So see I have some triggers already set up. You're going to see a default trigger
1:12:31
already set up for you and that's going to be all pages. So ideally what you want to do is you want to select all
1:12:38
pages in order for analytics to fire on all pages. So that's what we're doing. We're setting up a trigger. We're
1:12:45
basically telling Tag Manager, hey, if I get a visitor to any page on my website,
1:12:50
then I want you to fire Google Analytics. So, that's basically in summary how to set up your first tag.
1:12:57
And my recommendation is your first tag should be Google Analytics. And when you set up Analytics, you're going to have
1:13:03
to set up a variable for the tracking ID. And so, you get the tracking ID again from admin property settings. Copy
1:13:10
and paste that tracking ID over. Save it. You have your variable. That variable is going to be included in with
1:13:17
the tag. Then your trigger is going to be all pages. And there you go. You have your first tag. You have your first
1:13:23
variable. You have your first trigger. So that's basically what you want to do. And once you've added that tag, once
1:13:30
you've added that trigger, then the only thing you need to do now is basically
1:13:35
publish the tag. And so anytime you save a tag, you're going to go ahead and
1:13:41
submit it. So that way it gets published. So again, what you're going to do is let's take a step back here.
1:13:48
You're going to choose new tag. You're going to choose analytics from the drop- down menu. You're going to choose page
1:13:55
view. Then basically you're going to add your tracking ID so you could set up the
1:14:00
variable. And then basically that's what you need to do. Okay? You're going to add that tracking ID. And then voila,
1:14:06
that's your tag with a variable. And then once you've done that, then you're going to click submit. So when you click
1:14:13
submit, you're basically saying, hey, I want this tag to go live now, this tag
1:14:18
and trigger. And once you've done that, then analytics is ready to go. And
1:14:24
anytime somebody goes to your website on any page, tag manager is going to fire Google Analytics. So the great thing
1:14:31
here is you have something called Google Tag Assistant, and that's an extension
1:14:36
that works with Chrome. And so when you've actually added tag manager to your site or you have analytics running
1:14:43
in tag manager, you can confirm if those tags are firing properly. So let's take
1:14:48
a look at how Google Tag Assistant works. Okay. So if you just do a search
1:14:54
for Google Tag Assistant, you're going to see here that it's basically just an extension that works in Chrome. And it
1:15:01
unfortunately it only works in Chrome browser. It doesn't work in any other browser. So go ahead and install that
1:15:08
extension into Chrome. And when you do that, you're going to see this nice icon
1:15:13
here in your browser. And now if you go to any website and I click on Google Tag
1:15:18
Assistant and I click on enable. Okay. So basically I'm loading Google Tag Assistant. And now once I refresh the
1:15:26
page, I can see that this particular site has Google Tag Manager installed.
1:15:31
And not only does it have tag manager installed, I can see that it's also has Google Analytics running. I have also
1:15:38
Google Optimize running and I have Google Ads remarketing tag running in tag manager. So that's what tag
1:15:45
assistant does. It allows you to see if one tag manager is on the site and if it
1:15:51
is great, what other tags are firing on this particular site? So tag assistant's
1:15:57
telling me I have these particular tags firing on that site and they're firing
1:16:02
within tag manager. So tag assistant is a great way to confirm if one tag
1:16:08
manager is on the site and two what other tags are firing on the site. Now another way you could confirm if tag
1:16:15
manager is firing on the site is you can go into preview mode. So even before you
1:16:20
submit and publish your tag and trigger, you can click on the preview mode. So if
1:16:26
I click preview in tag manager, so basically that's going to put me in
1:16:31
preview mode. And so what does that mean? Well, that means that now I'm free to go to my website and see if those
1:16:39
tags are firing. And so let's take a look at what that looks like. So if I go to the website and just click refresh,
1:16:46
then what's going to happen is Tag Manager is going to load in preview mode just as you see here. Okay. So that's
1:16:53
going to take a second, couple seconds to load up. And now what can I see in preview mode? I could see that I have
1:17:00
GTM firing, but I also have some other tags firing on this page. Remarketing, I
1:17:06
have Google Analytics, I have Google Optimize, I have some other tags firing as well. And so the preview mode shows
1:17:13
me what tags are firing on any given page. And I can also see what tags did
1:17:19
not fire. Okay, so here I have a number of tags already in GTM, but they didn't
1:17:24
fire on this particular page. So let's just say I clicked on the donate now button. I'm still in preview mode. So
1:17:31
I'm going to be able to see what tags fired. Now I could see I have a couple
1:17:36
of tags that have fired on this particular page. and then I can see what tags did not fire on this page. Okay, so
1:17:43
that's the preview mode. You can use the preview mode before you even submit a
1:17:48
tag and trigger to see if it fires. And that's the great benefit of tag manager. So if you're not sure if something's
1:17:55
going to fire or not, then you can always go into preview mode. Um, and if you are sure it's going to fire, then
1:18:01
you can go ahead and submit it. So you can leave preview mode and just go ahead and submit that particular tag and
1:18:08
trigger. So here I'm going to leave preview mode and now once I'm done and I'm sure the tag is going to fire and go
1:18:16
ahead and submit all my changes that I've worked on in terms of setting up tags and triggers. So that's really GTM
1:18:23
in a nutshell. So I have my tags. Okay, my tags are just snippets of code that
1:18:29
I'm going to put in whether that be Facebook or vet tracking or any other
1:18:35
Google product like optimize or page view. Then I have my triggers. My triggers are there to tell GTM when to
1:18:43
fire that tag. And the variables are there to help those tags and triggers work together. So remember that
1:18:49
particular variable we set up for Google Analytics. Okay, so here it is right here because we want to tell GTM what
1:18:58
property to specifically fire in Google Analytics. So that's why we set up that variable. But there are all sorts of
1:19:04
variables Google Tag Manager has built in or variables already created for you
1:19:10
or you can specifically define a variable. So variables are there to help the tags and triggers work together. So
1:19:16
when you set up a tag, you set up a trigger, you use a variable, you can always go into preview mode, preview it
1:19:23
by going to the website, seeing if it fires. If it fires, then voila, you can
1:19:28
go ahead and click submit, and that will publish the tag and trigger, and you're
1:19:34
good to go. That's pretty much how Tag Manager works. And again, I can't stress
1:19:39
that there's an unlimited number of tags you can add to Tag Manager. There's no
1:19:46
limit. So you got everything from anything from Google to non- Googlele to
1:19:52
event tracking, okay, to Facebook to anything that you want to track, you want to be able to put into Tag Manager.
1:19:59
And again, there's versioning. That's one of the great benefits of Tag Manager. So if I want to go back to an
1:20:04
older version, I can simply do that. So here you can see I'm on version 32. That's how Tag Manager works. And I
1:20:12
can't stress that, you know, Tag Manager is there to help you track interactivity
1:20:18
on the site because if you have a site that's interactive, that has a video, that has a download button, let's just
1:20:25
say, you know, you have all sorts of newsletter signups, Facebook, YouTube
1:20:30
buttons on your website, just like this website does, and you want to be able to track how many people click on that
1:20:36
particular button. Well, you're going to need Tag Manager. And when you have Tag Manager, you're going to be able to
1:20:42
track all of these button clicks and interactivity on your website. Choose from over 300 in demand skills and get

description to know more. We're going to talk about how to rank number one on Google. So, let's get started. And um
1:21:04
let's go with the scenario that you have a friend named Sam and he has a website
1:21:10
where he sells shoes, but Sam doesn't understand why his website's not ranking
1:21:15
number one on Google. And so typically to rank number one on Google, there are
1:21:21
some factors involved. And those are factors that are going to help Sam get
1:21:26
his website ranked number one on Google so he can sell his shoes, get traffic
1:21:31
and convert that traffic to conversions. So there are factors involved and so
1:21:37
what are those factors? Well, it always starts with keyword research. So, in
1:21:43
order to rank for a website where you sell shoes or you sell products, other
1:21:49
products like clothing or food or you're an automobile website, you know, you're
1:21:55
a mechanic, it doesn't matter whether you're selling to customers or selling to other businesses, you have to start
1:22:01
with the keyword research. And so, we're going to go into really explicit detail
1:22:07
on how to conduct a proper keyword research. And then the second factor
1:22:12
involved is high quality content. So in order to rank high on Google search, you
1:22:18
need to have high quality content. So we're going to go over what's involved with creating high quality content. Then
1:22:26
we're going to take that content, we're going to optimize it using onpage
1:22:31
elements and website level factors. So, we're going to take into account what's
1:22:36
involved with your website and what's involved with specific pages on your website in order to rank number one on
1:22:42
Google. Then, we're going to get into the offsite engagement. So, when it comes to ranking on Google, you need to
1:22:49
optimize your website and you need to do some elements off your website. You need
1:22:55
to be engaging off your website, meaning on other websites. And so, we're going to talk about what's involved with
1:23:02
off-site engagement. So SEO being a major channel for most companies and
1:23:07
websites where the opportunity to drive a lot of traffic is there but you have to earn that reward. The reward is a lot
1:23:14
of traffic but you have to earn the reward and there's a lot of work involved. And so ideally what we want to
1:23:20
do is follow what we call the 8020 rule when it comes to search engine
1:23:26
optimization and ranking on Google. And what do we mean by the 8020 rule? Well,
1:23:31
80/20 means we're investing 20% of our effort and 80% of the results are
1:23:38
obtained. So, we want to invest 20 and get back 80. That's basically what we mean by 8020. So, for example, if 20% of
1:23:46
our targeted keywords bring in 80% of the traffic, then that's following the 8020 rule. Or 20% of our landing pages
1:23:54
drive 80% of the overall traffic, that's following the 8020 rule. or 20% of our back links pass 80% of our link juice.
1:24:02
That's the 8020 rule. Meaning these targeted keywords, these targeted landing pages, these trying to target
1:24:09
back links using offsite engagement. We want to put in 20% of our effort on
1:24:15
those keywords, landing pages, and back links in return for 80% of the results.
1:24:21
So without further ado, let's get started with the keyword research. Let's
1:24:26
talk about that keyword research for a website with shoes. And and it doesn't really matter what particular product
1:24:35
you have. If you need to rank number one on Google, it all starts with the keywords as I mentioned before. And so
1:24:42
in this example, if you have a website where you sell shoes for kids, you're going to want to be found for certain
1:24:48
keywords. So the obvious keyword here would be shoes for kids. Well, every
1:24:54
keyword that you target has search volume associated with it. So that means
1:25:00
when we talk about search volume, we're talking about how many people on average
1:25:05
type in that keyword or related keyword on Google.com or Google search. And
1:25:11
there's always an average number of searches associated with every keyword. And we call that search volume. How much
1:25:18
search volume? So obviously if we're going to target a keyword, we want to have as much volume as possible.
1:25:24
However, there's always going to be competition for those keywords, meaning
1:25:29
there's always going to be other websites who want to rank number one on Google for the same keywords. And we
1:25:35
call that competition or difficulty. So for every keyword, you're going to have volume and you're going to have
1:25:41
competition or difficulty. And the difficulty ranges as well depending on
1:25:46
the tool you use. And we'll get into that in a minute. But search volume is
1:25:52
how much on average people are typing in that keyword or close variance of that
1:25:57
keyword. And the difficulty is measured in terms of for kids is highly relevant,
1:26:02
has high volume, and low competition, then that's a keyword we want to target. So we always want to focus in on those
1:26:09
three areas. So there's always a trade-off with keywords. So, shoes for kids might have high volume but also
1:26:16
might have high competition or difficulty. If we look for another keyword that's just as relevant, for
1:26:23
example, shoes for children, it may still have high search volume, but the competition or the difficulty may be
1:26:30
lower. And if that's the case, then that may be a better keyword for us to target. Instead of something highly
1:26:38
competitive like shoes for kids, we can focus on another relevant keyword like shoes for children with just as much
1:26:45
volume and lower competition. And the reason why we want lower competition is
1:26:50
because we want to be able to rank for that keyword. So the higher the competition, the harder it is for us to
1:26:57
rank number one on Google for that keyword. And so the whole idea beyond keyword research is analyzing and
1:27:04
choosing the best keywords. So we want to identify a list of keywords that are always relevant. We want to choose the
1:27:10
keyword that your competitors are ranking for. And we want to use thirdparty tools to choose keywords to
1:27:16
identify which keywords have low competition and what keywords have high
1:27:21
search volume. So, one thing to take into consideration when you're doing keyword research is that the longer the
1:27:28
keyword phrase, or in other words, longtail keywords, or keywords with
1:27:33
three keywords in the phrase or more, you're going to always have less competition. But there's always a
1:27:40
trade-off with longtail keywords, meaning the longer the keyword phrase, there's going to be less volume, but the
1:27:47
trade-off is less competition. And so what we want to do is we want to brainstorm some ideas and find those
1:27:53
relevant keywords. So let's look at an example here. So if we go to Google ads,
1:27:59
so Google ads has a tool called keyword planner. And let's just say I have a a
1:28:05
website where I'm selling dried figs. And if I'm selling dried figs, I want
1:28:11
people to buy these dried figs. However, in order to attract them, I want to be
1:28:16
able to show them that, hey, we have a a bunch of recipes. And if I show you a bunch of recipes where you can use dried
1:28:23
figs, maybe you'll buy these dried figs to using these recipes. And so we're
1:28:28
going to look for keywords related to bread recipes because if we can optimize
1:28:34
for our recipes page for bread, then that will attract an audience who wants
1:28:39
to make bread and use dried figs with those bread recipes. So that's the example I'm going to give here. And so
1:28:46
if I look at the keyword planner in Google Ads, if I just type in bread recipes, what Google is going to do is
1:28:53
they're going to give me an average monthly search volume. So I can see the average monthly search volume here is
1:29:01
60,500. And so in order to do keyword volume and the competition you're getting for certain keywords. So if I go
1:29:07
into a spreadsheet here, my theme of keywords is bread recipes. My keyword is
1:29:13
bread recipes and my volume therefore is going to be 60,500. However, if I go back into
1:29:21
Google's keyword planner, Google's telling me the competition is low. So that's great. I want high volume. I want
1:29:28
low competition. But how low is low? So we want to be careful. So if we're going
1:29:34
to put in numbers into a spreadsheet, we want to figure out what that competition really is for the keyword bread recipes.
1:29:41
So if I go to Google and just type in bread recipes, I'm going to be able to see
1:29:47
771 billion results for the keyword bread recipes. Now, is 771 billion our
1:29:55
real competition? Maybe, maybe not. What we want to do is put in a syntax. And we
1:30:01
want to put in the syntax all in title and then colon space and then our keyword. And the reason why we do that
1:30:08
in search is because we want to be able to identify the true competitive number
1:30:13
or the true number of websites who are trying to rank for bread recipes. And if
1:30:19
we put in the syntax all entitle colon and then our keyword bread recipes, we'll be able to see that there are
1:30:27
998,000 results. That's a lot lower than 771 billion. So that means that
1:30:35
998,000 sites or listings have the keyword bread recipes in the title tag.
1:30:42
And the title tag is what shows up in the search engine results. And so if I look down and scroll down here, I can
1:30:49
see bread recipes are in every one of these title tags. So title tag is an
1:30:56
important element to rank number one on Google. And we'll talk about that in a few minutes. But if we understand that
1:31:03
there are 998,000 results with bread recipes in the title tag, then this tells us that
1:31:09
those are the websites who are trying to rank number one on Google for that keyword. And therefore, those are the
1:31:15
websites we need to jump over in order for our website to rank number one on
1:31:21
Google. And so therefore, I'm going to put in 998,000 in my spreadsheet as the
1:31:27
competitive number. And so now I could see for the keyword bread recipes, I have
1:31:32
60,500. And if my comp competition is 998,000 then my KI or keyword
1:31:40
effectiveness index or in other words the ratio of volume to competition is
1:31:46
6%. So that's nothing more than volume divided by competition. So that tells me
1:31:52
that my KI or my ratio between volume competition is 6%. So remember we want
1:32:00
more volume than we want competition. So, anytime you do a keyword research, you're going to find a number of
1:32:06
different relevant keywords. So, if I go back into Google's keyword planner, if I
1:32:12
typed in bread recipes, you could see that Google is going to give me a number
1:32:17
of different keywords related to bread recipes. Let's just say I have another keyword that I want to think about
1:32:24
optimizing for, being ranked on Google for, and that's banana bread recipe. very similar keyword as bread recipes
1:32:31
except it's a little longer tail. Now, if I type in banana bread recipe in
1:32:36
Google's keyword planner, now I can see the average monthly search volume is actually gone up. It's
1:32:43
368,000. I can also see the competition is low. So, those are good signs. So,
1:32:48
now I can see 368,000. I'm going to go ahead and put that in my spreadsheet. Now, I'm going
1:32:54
to go into Google. I'm going to put in my syntax all in title. I'm going to put in banana bread recipe. I'm going to hit
1:33:01
enter. And now I can see I have 233,000 results with the keyword banana
1:33:09
bread recipe in the title tag. So if I look at the title tags, I can see banana
1:33:14
bread recipe, banana bread recipe, banana bread recipe on all the listings
1:33:20
in the Google search results. So that tells me I have 233,000 results that I have to jump over
1:33:27
in order to rank number one on Google. So I'm going to put 233,000 in my spreadsheet. Now I can see
1:33:34
my KI or my volume to competition ratio is 157 158%. And so to me that's a lot
1:33:44
better number to work with. Or in other words, that's a lot better keyword
1:33:50
because it's just as relevant and it has a higher ratio of volume to competition.
1:33:55
So therefore, banana bread recipe is going to be a better keyword to optimize
1:34:01
for in order to rank number one on Google. So that's the whole idea behind keyword research. You want to brainstorm
1:34:09
ideas. There are plenty of tools out there. So the tool I recommend is Google
1:34:14
Ads keyword planner. Google's going to give you how much search volume. They're
1:34:20
going to tell you the competition, but then you're going to go into Google search. You're going to use the syntax
1:34:25
all in title to get a more accurate read on the actual competitive number. And so
1:34:31
to find out how keywords that your competitors are ranking for, you can use those keyword tools that I mentioned.
1:34:38
Another tool that I use is Moz. So ma, if you go to ma.com, they have a tool called keyword
1:34:45
explorer. So if we just type in the keyword, for example, bread recipes,
1:34:51
it's going to be able to tell us how much volume and the difficulty. So you
1:34:56
can use other tools at your disposal. Figure out the volume and the difficulty. There are plenty of tools
1:35:02
out there, but the one thing I would just make sure is you use everything at your disposal. So you can use social
1:35:09
media to find the most shared article for a particular topic or keyword like bread recipes. You could check other
1:35:16
platforms that have a lot of shared content like Reddin and Kora where you
1:35:22
can ask people about certain topics using keywords to figure out how much competition or volume there might be.
1:35:28
You can stay up to date on industry news to get an idea of what types of keywords
1:35:34
are trending. But when it comes to keywords and keyword research, remember
1:35:39
for every web page, we want to be able to pick two keywords. We want a primary and secondary keyword. So when we do
1:35:46
keyword research and we enter all our keywords into our spreadsheet, we want
1:35:52
to be able to have a number of different keywords. In this case, we're focusing on the theme bread recipes. We want to
1:35:59
have different keywords because we want to be able to choose a primary keyword and a secondary keyword because we want
1:36:06
to be able to focus on multiple keywords for each page because we don't want to put necessarily all our eggs in one
1:36:13
basket. Meaning we won't want to put all our emphasis just on one keyword to rank for. We want multiple keywords to try
1:36:21
and rank for. So the primary keyword can define the nature of our business. The
1:36:26
secondary keyword could be just highly relevant to our keyword. At the end of the day, we want to choose multiple
1:36:33
keywords to try and rank on Google for that page. So, for example, we have a
1:36:39
blog and we're using ice cream recipes and we're blogging about ice cream recipes. We can have a primary keyword
1:36:46
that is about ice cream recipes or homemade ice cream recipes. We're going to always want to find out what the
1:36:52
volume and the competition is. Our secondary keyword could be built around
1:36:58
other similar keywords like low-fat ice cream recipes or fat-free ice cream
1:37:03
recipes or low-fat homemade ice cream recipes. Those are complimentary keywords just like our bread recipes and
1:37:11
banana bread recipe. So, one thing we want to do when we do keyword research
1:37:17
is we want to be able to target one keyword per content when you can target
1:37:23
many. We want to be able to target multiple keywords, not necessarily target one keyword. And so we want to be
1:37:30
able to cluster keywords. So we don't want to target just one. We want to target multiple keywords per page. And
1:37:37
when we talk about clustering, if we go back to our keyword research, what we're
1:37:42
doing is we're clustering a bunch of keywords under the theme bread recipes. And so by looking at the volume, looking
1:37:50
at the competition, looking at the KI, we can choose different keywords for our
1:37:55
page. And that's what we mean by clustering. We want to cluster keywords into a content theme. So why target only
1:38:01
one keyword per content when we can target many? Because we don't want to put all our eggs in one basket. We don't
1:38:08
want to target just one keyword. We want to target many. And so that means clustering your keywords into a theme
1:38:14
and choosing multiple keywords for that particular page. And when we do that, we
1:38:20
have a better opportunity to rank high on Google search. And the whole idea
1:38:26
behind ranking high on Google search is we can get the volume. So, if we know we're ranked number one on Google search
1:38:33
for bread recipes or banana bread recipe, we know we stand a chance of getting a majority of the volume
1:38:42
associated with that keyword. And if we can get the volume and get the traffic,
1:38:47
then we can get the conversions. So, let's move on to high quality content
1:38:53
and talk about the impact content has on your ability to get your website ranked
1:38:59
number one on Google. So, let's just say you have content on your website and the
1:39:06
content is ranking on, you know, page four of Google and it's that blog with
1:39:12
ice cream recipes. And if it's just content for the sake of content, it's not really informative, then it's not
1:39:19
necessarily going to get good engagement. In the eyes of Google, you know, they want to rank content that's
1:39:25
very informative, it's very fresh, it's exciting to read, it's interesting, it's
1:39:30
going to have good engagement. So, if it's a recipe or an article about any
1:39:35
topic, if it's the content is just not informative, then you're not going to get good engagement. And when you don't
1:39:42
get good engagement, if people don't stay on the site to engage in the content and they just leave the website
1:39:48
after landing on the page causing a bounce, then the content is just going to continue to fall down the rankings
1:39:55
and we want to prevent that. We want to move up the rankings. We want to be number one on Google. We don't
1:40:01
necessarily want to fall in the rankings for our content. So content is a key
1:40:06
driver in being able to rank number one on Google. So if the content is on page
1:40:12
nine, what can we do? Well, we want to be able to, you know, take that content
1:40:18
and do something with it. We feel like we did write engaging content. So let's go ahead and share it on social media.
1:40:24
And to me, social media is a good platform to share your content because on social media platforms like Facebook,
1:40:32
for example, you're building a community on that platform. That community is already interested in your content. So,
1:40:39
if you're sharing an ice cream recipe, especially in the summertime, and you're engaging with your community on that
1:40:45
platform, then the likelihood of that community on that platform is going to
1:40:51
increase engagement. Increased engagement will send social signals to
1:40:56
the search engine that says, "Hey, this content is good quality." Likewise for any other platform. Most social media
1:41:04
platforms have engagement metrics and those engagement metrics pass signals.
1:41:10
Is it good? Is it not good? Do we like this content? Are we giving it a thumbs up? Are we going to want to follow it?
1:41:15
Are we going to want to share it? And so, if you share content that you feel is engaging on social platforms, then
1:41:23
it's going to be engaging and it's likely going to cause an increase in engagement. For example, a decrease in
1:41:30
bounces. And once you share that quality content, then the likelihood of it
1:41:36
moving up the rankings, even as far as number one on Google, is going to be greater. So you always want to start out
1:41:42
writing good quality content. So let's talk about good quality content because
1:41:48
Google does take content seriously. They do take into account what other people think of that content. So highquality
1:41:55
content is an important factor. So how to create good content? That's always
1:42:00
the question. So, let's talk about some best practices here. Remember in the
1:42:05
last segment we talked about keyword research. So, we want to perform good keyword research. Why? Because we want
1:42:12
to choose keywords. Remember, we're choosing multiple keywords per page. One keyword could be related to our brand.
1:42:20
One keyword could be related to the content, but another keyword could be related to a user's intent, like
1:42:26
recipes. If you recall the example we used with bread recipes, maybe somebody's looking to type in a keyword
1:42:32
that says, "How do I make, you know, a bread?" Or, "How do I make a specific type of bread?" Or, "How do I make
1:42:38
banana bread?" Or, "What's the best recipe for banana bread?" They're question related and we want to be able
1:42:45
to answer those questions. So, that's where choosing those right keywords that's going to respond to a user's
1:42:51
intent. So, starts with choosing the right keywords. So remember we talked
1:42:56
about a number of different tools when we talked about keyword research. So there's a research tool that you can use
1:43:03
called phrase.io and that will help you do quick research on you know keywords
1:43:10
and trends and whatnot. So if you know about a research tool that you use for
1:43:15
keyword research then drop us a comment below. I'd be interested in getting your comments about keyword research and what
1:43:22
research tools are out there. So, if you know something better than phrase.io, drop a comment below and we'd be
1:43:28
interested in getting your perspective. So, keyword research is key, but creating content that fulfills users
1:43:35
requirements. So, answering those questions. If it's a recipe, we want to answer that question. If it's
1:43:40
directions, we want to answer that question. If they don't know how to do something, we want to answer that question. And that's the whole idea
1:43:46
behind content. Content is not just to fill a page. It's to really fulfill
1:43:52
users requirements. That's when you get good engagement. So if somebody's typing in something on Google and they're
1:43:58
looking for an answer, your content should answer that question. But we also want to make the content readable. So in
1:44:04
other words, you know, write for your audience. Don't impress anybody with
1:44:10
very high vocabulary type words that somebody doesn't necessarily know the meaning of. Don't use jargon. Don't use
1:44:18
a street language. for example, use everyday common language that's just
1:44:23
easily digestible when your audience is reading. And then we want to keep that content organized. And so when we mean
1:44:30
organized, we want to use headers and subheaders. You know, break your content into paragraphs. Keep the flow
1:44:37
organized. If we can keep the flow organized, then it's going to be easier for somebody to read. And then it's okay
1:44:43
to add resources, especially resources from credible sites. So if you can incorporate those resources in there,
1:44:50
then it's just going to add the credibility to your content. Let the audience know that, hey, I've done my
1:44:55
research on this topic and this is what this person has to say about it. This person who seems to be credible. Okay,
1:45:01
so it only adds value to your content. So these are all tips to remember when
1:45:07
creating content. And then the one important tip here is we want to use white hat techniques. And when we say
1:45:12
white hat techniques, that means, you know, if we've chosen keywords that are
1:45:18
going to answer somebody's question, we don't want to stuff those keywords into the content. We want the content to be
1:45:24
naturally written. So when we say opt for white uh techniques, that's what we mean. Write the content naturally. Keep
1:45:31
it organized, keep it readable, include third-party sources, and make sure it
1:45:36
answers a question. So there are different types of content. So, there's
1:45:41
content where you just write words. It's all textbased. You could also use an infographic. An infographic is simply
1:45:48
just a graphic that visualizes exactly what you're trying to explain. For
1:45:53
example, if we want to write an article about how to write good engaging
1:46:00
content, we don't necessarily have to write all that out as a text. We can create an infographic. So, for example,
1:46:06
here's an infographic on 20 effective ways to basically not bore your readers,
1:46:13
but write engaging content. So, you could see this is an infographic. It's all graphically laid out. So,
1:46:20
infographics tend to be easier to understand because they're visual. They're easy for the end user to
1:46:27
comprehend because there's generally no jargon. And it's usually images that are portraying the point of what you're
1:46:33
trying to get across. And so it tends to break it up the monotony of just text.
1:46:39
It's more visually appealing and it's laid out and organized. So you could see this infographic has 20 different steps
1:46:47
or rules. And they lay those out all here in this infographic. And the great thing I like about infographics is you
1:46:53
could you could share them on social media. You can re-engage them as a post. You could save them on really any social
1:47:00
platform. So infographics tend to tell a better story versus say just writing text. You
1:47:07
can use video and images. So you don't necessarily have to lay it all out in an infographic. You can certainly insert a
1:47:15
video or an image into your content, especially if it's a blog post. If it's
1:47:21
a blog post, then sometimes video and images on its own tell the story. You
1:47:27
don't necessarily need text to go ahead and tell your story. A video or an
1:47:34
image, as they say, tells a thousand words. And so images and videos are
1:47:40
great to use in a blog post. So using different forms of content, you know,
1:47:45
you always want to review your content. When a user dwells on your web page for a longer time, Google will tend to
1:47:52
think, "Okay, this person's engaged, so we're going to rank that favorably." So if you're using infographics, videos,
1:47:59
and images, then the chances of somebody being more engaged are going to increase
1:48:04
versus just text that's not well organized and written out in a way that
1:48:10
somebody doesn't necessarily understand. So be creative in the types of content you use. So longer engaging content
1:48:18
tends to bode well with search engines. So this is according to HubSpot. So the
1:48:24
more word count you use, the more words you use, the chances of you ranking higher are going to be better. Just take
1:48:32
into account best practices. You want to maybe break up the content with an
1:48:37
image, organize it, make it engaging, use headers. So, it's not necessarily
1:48:42
just words. It's the words and how those words are written, how they're structured, the types of key words
1:48:48
you're using, how you're engaging with your audience. There's a lot of factors. Again, those best practices we just went
1:48:54
over. But the key is, you know, if you have longer, more engaging content, then
1:49:00
it's going to bode better for you on search engines. So, couple of steps to
1:49:05
create high quality content. So you want to begin with a comprehensive introduction. So always introduce your
1:49:12
content. Remember the content should be relevant to the keyword. So if you're choosing keywords in your keyword
1:49:19
research, think about answering that question. If somebody's typing in bread recipes, maybe they're looking for
1:49:25
banana bread recipes, how to make the best banana bread or how to make banana
1:49:30
bread using dried figs. We want to be able to align our content with that
1:49:35
keyword naturally. You want to create a title that's worthy, that's clickworthy. So remember, if you're in Google search
1:49:43
and you're doing search for something simple like bread recipes, we want to
1:49:48
some make something that's going to be, you know, engaging for somebody to click on like easy perfect yeast bread or easy
1:49:55
crusty French bread or something that's going to be engaging. you know, the best bread recipes or how to make the best
1:50:01
homemade bread, you know, something that's going to draw somebody's attention to the title of that blog
1:50:08
post. So, we want to include LSI keywords. So, what I mean by LSI
1:50:14
keywords in your content, we mean, you know, longtail keywords. Make it natural. Headings and subheadings should
1:50:21
consist of keywords and variants. So, if you're writing headers and subheaders,
1:50:27
include the keyword in there. And that way, the the content always stays relevant to the audience. Okay? Shorten
1:50:33
your sentences and paragraphs. So, don't write long paragraphs. Remember, we want to break this up. We want to make it
1:50:38
easy for the end user to read. And we want to always put internal links on our
1:50:46
blog post. Why? Because if we have internal links, then if we have a link
1:50:51
from one blog post to another blog post or say our blog post to an internal page
1:50:56
on our website, we want to make sure that it's relevant content. That way, if somebody's reading something and you
1:51:03
have an internal link, let's just say from a bread recipes page to a banana bread recipes page, then they may find
1:51:11
it interesting, click on that link, and go to the banana bread recipes page. So, it's keeping somebody engaged on your
1:51:17
website. So, putting in internal linking will help keep the the end user engaged
1:51:23
because you're offering up links that's relevant to the content. You always want to break up that content with images.
1:51:30
Okay? We want to use alt tags, meaning we want to pen the image with text so
1:51:37
that way if the image doesn't load, then at least the alt text will load. So we
1:51:42
can incorporate call out boxes and more importantly we want to update our
1:51:48
content regularly. So we always want to get the best recipe out there if it's
1:51:54
banana bread or different ways to create banana bread or always just coming up with ways to update the content. So we
1:52:00
want to keep our content or blog post fresh and then we want to include a CTA call to action. If we include a call to
1:52:07
action, then that's going to keep somebody engaged and have them act on
1:52:12
your content. So, these are steps to creating highquality content. And so,
1:52:18
let's look at an example here. And this is a threemonth-old post on Buzzfeed,
1:52:24
and it's 21 pictures that restore your faith in humanity. So, it has a lot of likes, a lot of tweets, and that means
1:52:31
it's engaged. People are engaged when reading that. And so if we go and look at it as an example, we could see it on
1:52:37
a Buzzfeed here. 21 pictures that will restore your faith in humanity. So this was written back in 2012. Again, a lot
1:52:46
of engagement, but if we look at it, we can see immediately that it's taking
1:52:51
into account third party sources. It's got some content. It's got images. It's
1:52:57
being broken up by images. We could see there's call to actions on there in the form of social. So people can go ahead
1:53:04
and go ahead and share it if they like it. Okay? It includes videos. It
1:53:09
includes images, third-party sources. So it's a good post because listen, you
1:53:16
know, it's engaging content. It's probably answering somebody's question about humanity. And we could see clearly
1:53:22
that look, you know, there's a lot of different examples here from a lot of different sources. And we could take
1:53:28
action on this content. So not just video, not just images, but text as well. And so it's very engaging, answers
1:53:35
questions, takes into account the different types of content available. So this is a good post in that regard. So
1:53:42
content's updated regularly, it's engaging, and it includes sources from
1:53:48
high authority websites. Some dos and don'ts on the content. So take into account the best practices I mentioned
1:53:55
about creating highquality content. answer those questions that the end user wants to hear, you know, because that
1:54:02
likely is going to be their search. And so, you want to be able to respond to the end user. That's part of creating
1:54:09
high-quality content. Different types of content, i.e. in the form of infographics or videos or text or
1:54:16
images. You can add images from public domain sites. You can be relatable and
1:54:21
use examples to clarify points just like the Buzzfeed article. Simplify complex
1:54:27
words. Don't use sophisticated language. Talk to your audience as if you they were standing right in front of you. And
1:54:33
use bullet points to exemplify your examples, your points. So some dos, the
1:54:39
don'ts. Obviously, don't lift content. We don't want to lift content from
1:54:46
another website. So that's plagiarism. So we want to have our own unique content. We also don't want to take
1:54:52
images from other websites. And so if you do happen to find an image that
1:54:57
works for your post and it's on somebody else's website, ideally that's not a
1:55:02
good situation. But if you do happen to do that, then always give credit to the website. Okay? So if you took it from
1:55:10
xyz.com, credit xyz.com for the image and even put a link back. But ideally,
1:55:16
you don't want to take images from other websites. Just as much as you don't want
1:55:21
to take copy, you don't want to take images. Use your own imagery and content. But if you don't have imagery,
1:55:28
then you can always go to stock photography. There are plenty of websites out there where you can sign up
1:55:33
for a subscription like uh Adobe Stock images as an example. You could sign up
1:55:39
for an account and in some cases you can sign up for a free account and use stock
1:55:45
imagery. Okay? Don't give less information to your audience. Give your audience what they deserve, which is the
1:55:50
information they're looking for. They're looking for the best banana bread recipes. Give them the best banana bread
1:55:56
recipes. Incorporate your own images. Break it up with titles. Give them a
1:56:02
good quality piece of content that they're going to be able to engage with. And so, if you put long paragraphs in
1:56:09
your content, then it's going to be less engaging. So, try to avoid those long paragraphs. Remember, shorten up the
1:56:16
paragraphs, keep the language simple, add in images, answer those questions,
1:56:22
use third party credible sources, but write it in your own words, and you should be on your way to creating good
1:56:28
quality content. Okay, so now that we've talked about high quality content in
1:56:34
order to get your pages ranked high on Google search, let's turn our attention
1:56:39
to optimizing onpage elements and discuss some website level factors that
1:56:46
are both going to help you rank high on Google search. So let's just do an overview of what we're talking about
1:56:52
when we talk about onpage elements and website level factors. So optimizing onpage elements include a number of
1:57:00
different things, but primarily we're going to focus in on meta tags, also known as metadescription tags, header
1:57:07
tags, also known as title tags, and URLs. So those are just some of the onpage elements we want to be able to
1:57:14
optimize using relevant keywords in order to rank high on Google search. We
1:57:21
also want to take a look at some website factors that will affect our ranking on
1:57:27
Google search. They include website architecture, having a secure website,
1:57:32
having a site map, and taking a look at page speed. So all of those are some of the website factors we need to take into
1:57:40
account in order to rank high on Google search. So title tag and metad
1:57:46
description together are considered meta tags. So both play an important role in
1:57:52
ranking high on Google. So we want to be able to write unique title and descriptions for each page on our
1:57:59
website. When I say unique, that means a title and a metad description need to be
1:58:04
different for every page on the website. And so if you're not quite sure what a title tag and a metad description tag
1:58:11
is, if you go to search and just type in any particular search query, the title tag is what's going to show up here in
1:58:18
bold. And then the description is going to show up below it, below the URL, and
1:58:24
that's going to describe the page. So both of these meta tags are important
1:58:29
because it describes what your page is all about, and that's what Google uses in the search results pages. So we want
1:58:36
to be able to pay attention to the length of our metatags. So if we go back
1:58:41
to our search results pages, met title tags are generally 60 65 characters.
1:58:48
Metadescription tags are generally 160 characters. So anything really longer
1:58:54
than that, then what's going to happen is the metadescription tag or the title
1:59:00
tag will get truncated. And so if we look here, for example, we could see all
1:59:05
of the title tags here fit the 65 character limit. But if you run over the
1:59:12
character count on metadescription, then Google is going to truncate the copy. So
1:59:17
you want to stay within your parameters in order to avoid getting your content truncated. And so the other thing when
1:59:25
we're writing title metadescription tags, we want to minimize keyword repetition. So if we're optimizing for
1:59:31
keyword, we don't want to necessarily just plug that keyword into the title tag and metadescription multiple times.
1:59:38
We want to make sure our title tags and metad descriptions are naturally written. So, if somebody's typing for
1:59:44
banana bread recipe with dried figs, you know, we want to have a nice title tag
1:59:50
in this description that is going to get somebody to respond uh based on their
1:59:56
need. And so, we definitely want to avoid keyword repetition, but we want to be able to use that keyword in the title
2:00:03
tag. Because if you remember from the earlier segment when we did the all- entitle syntax to find out exactly how
2:00:10
many competitors were using that particular keyword. Well, we obviously want to use that keyword in the title
2:00:15
tag because again the title tag is an important factor when it comes to search engine results. So we want to use the
2:00:23
keyword but we want to avoid stuffing or using it repetitively in our title tag
2:00:29
and our metad description. We want the title tag and the metad description to describe the page, sound natural, but
2:00:36
also be engaging because the point is we want people to click on our link and go
2:00:41
to our website from search engines. So title tags with numbers tend to result
2:00:48
in higher clickthrough rates. This is according to Moz. So, for example, if you just put in a title tag that says
2:00:54
learn digital marketing, well, that may work, but if you put a number in there like five easy ways to learn digital
2:01:02
marketing, that might get somebody to click on your link and go to your website. So, having questions in your
2:01:08
metatags can also increase your click-through rate. For example, if you just put learn the importance of first
2:01:14
page rankings, not too bad, but again, generic. But if you put it into the form
2:01:20
of question, how to rank number one on Google, it's more actionoriented. It's going to get somebody to resonate with
2:01:26
the question that they have and that may be their query, how to rank number one on Google. And so these techniques will
2:01:35
help you get higher clickthrough rates. And so according to back linko title tag
2:01:41
with a keyword can improve site ranking. So remember we want to include that keyword in the title tag even though we
2:01:47
only have 65 characters. We want to include that keyword but we want to avoid stuffing the keyword in there. We
2:01:54
want to again make the title tag actionoriented maybe with a number maybe
2:02:00
as a question with the keyword in there once naturally. Not easy to do, but
2:02:06
that's the beauty of SEO. If you can follow these best practices and write a
2:02:11
good title tag, then the chances of you improving in your search results are
2:02:17
going to be greater. So having only one H1 tag in your post is going to be good.
2:02:23
So remember when somebody clicks on a link, so let's just say they do find a title tag engaging and they click on
2:02:31
this this link here and they go to that website. You know, you want to start out with having that particular H1 tag
2:02:39
because the H1 tag, especially with the keyword in it, is going to signal to Google, hey, we're organizing our page.
2:02:46
And because it's an H1 tag, it's important. We're structuring the page according to best practices. So having
2:02:53
only one H1 tag in your post is definitely helpful. Having multiple tags, H tags in your post help organize
2:03:01
the page a lot better. So we want to add that targeted keyword in that tag and your header tag should be relevant to
2:03:08
the content. So if we go back to our example of the using dried figs with banana breads, well the title says
2:03:15
California fig banana bread. And remember the last segment when we're talking about high quality content?
2:03:20
Well, look no further than including a video into our content. So, not only
2:03:27
will this video help keep the engagement high, but it breaks up the monotony of the page and it's from a third party
2:03:34
source. So, it adds credibility to the page. So, adding a video based on the
2:03:39
last segment of highquality content definitely helps with ranking high on Google search. So following hierarchal
2:03:47
structure that means putting those H tags in there. H2 tags help break up the
2:03:53
content and we want to avoid repetition of H1 tags on your different web pages of your site. Meaning don't just put the
2:04:01
same H1 tag with the same keyword in it and keeping it blasze. We want to make
2:04:06
those H1 tags exciting to read but also used appropriately to break up the
2:04:12
content. So remember all white hat techniques. We want to avoid hidden
2:04:17
tags. We want to avoid stuffing keywords. We want things to be natural.
2:04:23
We don't want things to be forced. And your H1 tag should be 20 to 70
2:04:28
characters. Don't make long H1 tags. So if we go back to our page example, a
2:04:33
short, sweet tag here. California fig banana bread. It's relevant to the
2:04:38
content. It's short, sweet. It breaks up the monotony of the content. And more
2:04:44
importantly, and again, any content you have on the page should always answer the user's intent. Remember, people are
2:04:51
using search to answer questions, find information. Our content should be able to answer that for them. So, according
2:04:59
to John Mhler, senior web master trends analyst at Google, header tags would definitely help Google for rankings in
2:05:06
the search results. So, we want to use header tags. So when it comes to URLs,
2:05:11
we want to use hyphens and avoid underscores. So if we look at this URL
2:05:16
here, this uses hyphens, fig and banana bread. So it's all broken up with
2:05:22
hyphens. That's a best practice. Remember canonical URLs. A canonical URL
2:05:28
signals to Google this is the original content. So we want to use original
2:05:34
content. And if you have multiple sources of content out there on say different websites, we want to use a
2:05:40
canonical tag to signal to Google this is the original content please index
2:05:45
this content and not doesn't hurt to use a favicon in URL meaning a small icon.
2:05:51
It helps to break up the monotony and help your URL stand out. We can add
2:05:56
targeted keywords in the URL. So again, looking at the URL here, I could see we're using targeted keyword as part of
2:06:03
the URL structure. Fake and banana bread. And notice the H1 tag is fake banana bread. So it's all consistent and
2:06:11
it flows naturally. URLs that are no longer existing. Then we want to be able
2:06:17
to set up a redirect for those URLs. Meaning a 301 redirect is a server
2:06:22
response for Google that says, "Hey Google, this page is no longer available, but we permanently redirected
2:06:29
it to this page which is now available." So that's what a 301 redirect does. It helps signal to Google and all the other
2:06:36
search engines that if the page is no longer there, that's fine. You're just going to go to this page. This is the
2:06:42
page that's permanently there now. And another thing we want to do here is if
2:06:47
you have mobile URLs, you want to include those in the site map. And we're going to hit on that in just a minute.
2:06:54
But all URLs should be mobile friendly as well as desktop friendly. Meaning
2:07:00
take into account this best practices. Keep your URL short. Use hyphens. Put the keyword in that URL and make it easy
2:07:08
to understand. Want to avoid capital letters in the URLs. The URLs are case sensitive. So go lowercase. You should
2:07:15
always go lowercase on the URL. Readable URLs. Again, the rule of thumb here is
2:07:22
if you understand what the URL is, then Google is going to understand what the URL is. So the shorter the URL, the
2:07:29
easier it is to read, the easier it is to read, the better chance you have to rank high on Google search. So according
2:07:36
to backlink to URLs that are shorter definitely definitely help you rank. So,
2:07:41
we want to be able to shorten those URLs. Keep them short and sweet. Don't make them long and unreadable. So, those
2:07:49
are some on optimized ways or on page elements that help you optimize. Now, we
2:07:55
want to look at some website level factors that will help you optimize and rank high on Google search. So, good
2:08:01
site structure provides better crawling for search engine bots. And what do we mean by that? Well, we mean having your
2:08:08
site organized in a fashion that Google's going to be able to find all the pages. So, what do we mean by that?
2:08:15
Create a logical hierarchy structure. So, if you're selling shoes, you know,
2:08:20
you're going to have a homepage. Break the structure up into men's shoes, women's shoes, children's shoes. Then,
2:08:26
under men's shoes, you could have it by brand. It could be Nike Puma Adidas. On the women's side, it could be Nike Puma
2:08:33
Adidas. On the child side, it could be Nike, Puma, Adidas. And so, you want to keep the structure, flow, and a
2:08:40
hierarchy. So, we want to balance the amount of subcategories within each category. So, the men's, if it has Nike,
2:08:46
Puma, Adidas, the women should have Nike, Puma, Adidas. And so, you want to code your site navigation and CSS or
2:08:54
HTML. Meaning, we want to be able to use something that Google's going to be able to index. So most sites are built in
2:09:01
HTML and that's what Google likes to index. They like to index something that they could take back to their servers.
2:09:08
And then more importantly build a comprehensive structure for internal linking. So internal links mean that if
2:09:14
you're on a site you should have natural links pointing to other pages on your website. So to keep the flow going and
2:09:22
we don't want to have unnatural inbound links. You always want to have natural
2:09:27
internal links to keep the flow of the user going from one page to the other. So here I could see as an example all
2:09:34
the ingredients in this recipe. Well, this has an internal link to another page on our site and this happens to
2:09:40
link to a page where somebody can buy the ingredient. So it's a natural internal link. So John Doherty of Credo
2:09:48
has claimed that one of the biggest changes that he can make in fixing the CTO website is architecture. So for
2:09:55
example in credo Johny has increased the organic sessions by 74% and pages by per
2:10:01
session by 41%. Just by changing the site architecture. So you'd be surprised
2:10:06
by changing the site architecture what that will do to engagement. And so let's turn our attention to secure versus
2:10:13
non-secure. So what we mean by that is securing your site. We want to make it
2:10:18
sure that compliant with certain protocols. And so if we go back here, we
2:10:23
could see that this particular site is compliant. It is secure. HTTPS means it
2:10:30
has a secure license, meaning the site is secure. So Google likes secure versus
2:10:37
non-secure. So nonsecure would be HTTP. So we want HTTPS as our protocol. And what that
2:10:44
means is just enabling SSL certificates. And that means when you enable an SSL
2:10:50
certificate, that means your domain or your protocol is going to be turned to HTTPS. So Google prefers sites that are
2:10:58
secure versus nonsecure. So if you use HSTS as a protocol, that adds an extra
2:11:06
layer of security over the HTTPS. And HSTS prevents cookie hijacking. So
2:11:13
adding multiple layers of security always helps in my opinion. If you have an HTTP website, a nonsecure website,
2:11:22
you should look into buying an SSL certificate, getting your site flipped
2:11:28
over to HTTPS, because what's going to happen is your URL structure is going to change. when your URL structure changes,
2:11:35
Google's going to recognize that because they're going to index your site and when they index your site, they're going to see those secure URLs and that's
2:11:43
going to work favorably in your favor and help you rank higher on Google search. So websites using secure or
2:11:51
HTTPS have a higher chance of ranking higher. So HTTPS is a ranking signal
2:11:57
because Google indexes those pages. So let's also talk about site maps. So sitemap is one of the most important
2:12:04
ways to improve your website ranking. Why? Well, because site maps are a way
2:12:09
to organize all your URLs into one file. So we're basically going to prioritize
2:12:15
all our web pages in a sitemap. So if you go to any particular website and you
2:12:20
type in sitemapxml, you're likely going to see all the pages on your website. So,
2:12:28
usually the sitemap is located in the root directory. So, if I type in
2:12:33
sitemap.xml, I'm going to be able to see all the pages in my root directory. And I can also prioritize them. I can also
2:12:41
alert Google as to how often they change. And every page is going to have
2:12:47
a date stamp associated with it. So, Google can actually see how often it changes. So, remember, we want our
2:12:53
content to be updated frequently. So if content's not updated frequently or it's
2:12:58
not fresh, then Google's going to see that site that that date stamp, that last modification date. So we want to be
2:13:05
able to make sure content's updated frequently. We want to let Google know that we changed it frequently. And we
2:13:10
want to be able to prioritize our pages, let Google know, hey, these pages are important to us. So all that can be set
2:13:17
up in a sitemap. We want to be able to add canonical versions of URLs in the site map. So, we want to be able to add
2:13:24
all our original URLs in our sitemap. And so, we always want to build dynamic URLs, sitemaps for larger websites. And
2:13:31
what do I mean by dynamic URLs? That means that if I look at this site map and we're always adding content, let's
2:13:38
just say in the form of a blog. Well, guess what? We want those pages to be added to the sitemap as they're
2:13:44
published. So, as we add pages to the blog or to the site, then they should
2:13:50
automatically be added to the site map. And so in effect, what's going to happen is we're going to be able to see the
2:13:57
site map grow with more URLs. When the sitemap grows with more URLs, then that
2:14:02
means then Google's going to index more pages. They're going to index more fresh pages. So they're going to be able to
2:14:08
get those pages that are just published quicker. So that's the whole idea behind
2:14:14
dynamic sitemaps is we want to be able to capture all the URLs just as they're published and we want to be able to
2:14:20
maintain our site maps and so I would always recommend a dynamic sitemap but you can always create your own sitemap
2:14:28
just by going to a tool called XML sitemap. So if I just type in XML
2:14:34
sitemaps into Google search here, I could see XML sitemaps generator and I
2:14:40
can be able if I have a small website just create a free and simple sitemap on
2:14:45
my own. When XML sitemaps creates it or your platform creates a dynamic site map
2:14:52
either way the sitemap's going to sit in the root directory and then what we want to do in turn is let Google know where
2:14:59
that sitemap is. So in search console, we want to be able to submit the
2:15:04
sitemap. So you're going to add the sitemap. You're going to let Google know where it is. It should be in the root
2:15:10
directory, and it should be called sitemap.xml. And when you do that, Google's going to be able to take those
2:15:17
URLs and index them. So we could see we submitted 528 URLs. Google index 521.
2:15:25
So, one thing about URLs here is when we create a site map, we're putting all
2:15:30
your URLs in there. We do not add no index URLs in your site map. And what
2:15:36
that means is that any URL we don't want Google to index, we're just going to
2:15:41
exclude from the sitemap. Okay? So, we want Google to take all the URLs we want indexed and put them in the sitemap. So,
2:15:48
according to Edgy, using sitemaps for SEO can increase your website's
2:15:53
visibility and help you get indexed. Why? Because what you're in effect doing is taking all your URLs that you want
2:15:59
indexed. You're telling Google how often they're modified. You're telling Google which ones are important and you're
2:16:06
submitting that to Google. And so Google's going to be able to take all these URLs quicker, index them quicker,
2:16:12
and when they're indexed quicker, you can get ranked quicker. And when you get ranked quicker, you can get traffic
2:16:17
quicker. So that's the whole idea behind sitemaps. So let's turn our attention to page speed now. So, one of the last
2:16:24
factors for our website besides architecture, making it secure, and adding site maps is we want to take a
2:16:31
look at how quick our pages load. Here are some tips in order to optimize page
2:16:37
speed. Because ideally, the quicker a page loads, the more engaged the user is going to be. If it takes a longer time
2:16:44
for the page to load all the elements of that page, then what's going to happen is the user is going to get impatient,
2:16:50
maybe leave the website all together or go to another page. And so we want to be
2:16:56
able to optimize images. So any image that's of large size in terms of
2:17:01
megabytes, we want to be able to optimize that, compress the image. So that's one way to speed up page speed.
2:17:08
We want to use a simple website design, you know, HTML with CSS or cascading
2:17:14
stylesheets. Just a simple design with simple hierarchy and website navigation
2:17:20
structure. So, nothing fancy, nothing complex, just a simple website design
2:17:25
with optimized images. We want to leverage browser caching and we want to upgrade the server response time.
2:17:31
Meaning all your files are sitting on the server. So when somebody goes to a web page, the server is serving up all
2:17:38
of those files, the images, the text, etc. And so we want the server to
2:17:44
respond as quick as possible. So when it comes to page speed, we can look at the factors affecting page speed in Google
2:17:51
Analytics. So if I go to Google Analytics and I go under behavior and I go under sight speed and I go to
2:17:58
overview, I'm going to be able to see what my average load time is for my
2:18:03
site. And ideally, we want our pages to load as quick as possible. So that means
2:18:10
anything under 4 seconds, anything 4 seconds or higher. And it's likely the
2:18:15
end user is going to leave the page. There's a correlation between page load time and bounce rate. And so what Google
2:18:22
actually does is give you speed suggestions. So if we do have a page that loads slow, we can just go to speed
2:18:28
suggestions in Google Analytics. And we go to speed suggestions. Then Google's going to be able to tell us, hey, this
2:18:36
particular page load fast, this page page loads slow. And if it loaded slow,
2:18:41
why is it loading slow? So here we could see the homepage as example is loaded on
2:18:46
average of 7 seconds. Well, if we look here, they're going to give us some suggestions. So if I click on this page
2:18:52
speed suggestions, it's going to load a report and a tool called page speed insights. And basically what it's then
2:18:59
going to do after it's done running is it's going to tell me all the ways in which I can optimize my pages not only
2:19:07
for desktop but also for mobile. So here I can see for desktop or for mobile I
2:19:15
can look at some ways in which I can optimize it to increase page speed. for
2:19:20
example, sizing my images properly, server response time, reducing my server
2:19:25
response time, avoiding multiple page redirects. So, there's a lot of opportunities that we can do to speed up
2:19:33
page load time, and all that's found in page speed insights and all that's found within Google Analytics. So, remember,
2:19:40
optimizing code, minimizing redirects, optimizing your images, upgrading your
2:19:45
server responsive, all of those are factors. And so again, you can go into analytics, page speed, insights, and you
2:19:52
could see exactly what Google is recognizing as what's lowering or slowing down your page load time. So
2:19:59
Google takes sight speed as one of the most important ranking factors. Why? Because they're going to rank pages not
2:20:07
only with high quality content that are relevant to the keyword queries, but they want those pages to have a good
2:20:14
user experience. So if somebody clicks on the page, then the user should be able to see that content fairly quickly.
2:20:21
And so that's why it's such an important factor. So the quicker your pages load, the chances of you ranking higher are
2:20:27
going to be better. So according to web performance today, Walmart as an example experienced a decline in conversions. So
2:20:34
what they did was looked at their page speed. And when they looked at their page speed, you'd be surprised what that
2:20:40
did. just increasing it from one to four seconds or decreasing it basically
2:20:45
increase conversion. So there's always going to be a correlation between how quick a page loads and how engaged the
2:20:52
user is because if it's users engaged they're going to stay on the site and if they stay on the site then their chances
2:20:58
of converting are going to be higher. So just even one to two seconds increase in
2:21:03
page load time will make a world of difference in terms of engagement and conversions. Let's turn our attention to
2:21:10
off-site engagement. So, previously we talked about onpage elements and website
2:21:16
factors that are affect our rankings for search results. But we also need to turn
2:21:21
our attention away from our website, meaning what we do on our website and turn our attention what we can do for
2:21:27
our website off our website and onto other websites. So, that's offsite
2:21:32
engagement. And so, let's look at an example. So that ice cream recipes blog
2:21:38
I'm going to talk about how to rank YouTube videos. Today said simply learn
2:21:44
we take our videos on YouTube very seriously. Meaning that when we create
2:21:50
videos we want people to see them because we know we make good videos and we know we have good content and we know
2:21:56
that our audience is going to enjoy it. And so we want our audience to see the videos that we're creating. And so we're
2:22:03
going to give you some tips and tricks and methodology and ideas on how to get
2:22:09
your videos to rank on YouTube. So at SimplyLearn, if I go to YouTube and I
2:22:15
just type in machine learning, you could see we're right here is the first organic video on YouTube for machine
2:22:22
learning. If I jump over to Google and I type in machine learning basics, you can
2:22:27
see we're number we're number one for machine learning basics under videos. If I click on all, we're also ranked here
2:22:34
as well under the video section on organic search results. Another example, data science for beginners. We ranked
2:22:42
number one for that. If I look at another keyword, data science interview questions. Okay, we'll rank number two
2:22:47
for that. So, we're ranking for a lot of videos. And why are we ranking for a lot
2:22:52
of different content and videos on Google search and on YouTube? Well, we
How to Rank #1 on Google
2:22:58
put a lot of work in behind the scenes of creating the video. And that's what we want to show you. So part of that has
2:23:03
a lot to do with, you know, how our audience engages and sees our video. So
2:23:09
for example, we're looking at the machine learning basics video here, and we can see that it has over 221,000
2:23:16
subscribers for this video, 234,000 views. We've had over 2,000 people like
2:23:23
the video, and we have had over 270 plus comment on the video. So when we get our
2:23:29
videos to rank, then we can see there's a lot of engagement. And so that's the whole idea is when you do a video and
2:23:35
you want it to show up on YouTube, you want people to enjoy it, you want people to share it, you want people to like it,
2:23:41
you want people to comment on it. And that's part of the whole ecosystem of YouTube. It's, you know, we're going to
2:23:46
show you behind the scenes of what it takes to get your videos to rank. And then we're going to show you some of the metrics involved with some of these
2:23:53
videos. We're going to talk about how to get traffic to your website. So, thank you for joining and let's get started.
2:24:00
So, let's imagine you're setting up your own website. Okay? You're clicking away,
2:24:05
you're developing using some good tools, you're developing, you're designing,
2:24:11
you're doing some QA, you're testing, you're sharing with friends in an alpha version, and then finally, your website
2:24:19
is all set up. Congratulations. Well, when you hit enter and your
2:24:24
website is finally published, what's going to happen? Well, few days later, you're checking your website and you're
2:24:31
looking at analytics and you notice your traffic's very low. Okay? Well, you're scratching your head because you've done
2:24:38
all this work with your website, but you're not getting any traffic. So the
2:24:43
reason is you spent all your time developing designing the website to make
2:24:49
it look good but you didn't do anything or any planning or any strategy around
2:24:55
bringing users to your website. So the two go hand inand you just can't build a website without thinking about how to
2:25:03
drive users to the website. And so before I tell you how to bring traffic to your website, let me tell you why
2:25:10
this is so important. Okay? Why do we want to bring users to our website? I mean, it has to be on equal ground as
2:25:16
web development and design is somebody who goes to your site and then does
2:25:21
something when they get to your site. So, you have users and when those users get to your site, they're generating
2:25:28
page views and traffic and you want to turn that traffic into engagement. Okay?
2:25:33
So, each page's traffic is configured independently of all their pages. So
2:25:38
when you go when somebody goes to your website, they look at a page, that's a page view. And certain pages on your
2:25:44
website, you want to turn that page view into a conversion. Okay? Whether that be, you know, looking at a video or
2:25:51
purchasing something. So think of these pages on your website as salespeople. They're trying to convert visitors who
2:25:57
come to your website. But first, we need to get the visitors to your website. So when you get visitors to your website
2:26:04
again you can generate sales which means revenue or you can increase brand
2:26:10
awareness or you can earn revenue through sponsored post and advertisement. So if you have for
2:26:16
example a lot of content on your website you can turn that in to revenue by
2:26:21
hosting ads on your website. So when somebody clicks on that ad you're going to earn a percentage of that click. Okay
2:26:27
what that click is worth. So having a website means a lot of good things for
2:26:33
you, but first you got to get the traffic there. And so what we're going to do is we're going to tell you how to
2:26:39
drive traffic to your website. So there's lots of different ways in which you can bring traffic to your website.
2:26:46
Well, the first is paid advertising. So paying to advertise your products, services with ads is one of the easiest
2:26:52
ways to drive traffic to your website. So some of the options available are
2:26:58
search ads, social media ads or display ads. So search ads are ads that are
2:27:04
displayed in the search engine results. So when a user types in a keyword query,
2:27:09
you want your ad to show up based on that keyword query. Okay? So an example is digital marketing course. Somebody
2:27:16
types in digital marketing course and simply learn is the first ad that shows up. How do we know it's an ad? because
2:27:23
you could see the word ad next to the domain. So when somebody clicks on that link, simply learn is going to pay
2:27:31
Google. So that's how search advertising works. Okay. The next is social. So
2:27:36
social media marketing involves increasing traffic or engagement or brand awareness. So lots of different
2:27:42
strategies, but you're instead of doing this on search, you're doing it on a social media platform. Okay? So for
2:27:49
example, you can advertise on any particular platform and the way you
2:27:55
advertise could be with an image. It could be with a video. So in this case, you could see Cobrio is doing a
2:28:03
sponsored ad here. How to succeed with Google ads. And then another form of
2:28:08
advertising is display. So display means creating ads that are placed on specific
2:28:13
websites. So with display, unlike search, you have a choice in the ad
2:28:19
format. With search, you only have text ads. But with display, you have text ads, image ads, rich media ads, video
2:28:26
ads. So you have lots of different options in which you can advertise on other websites. So the idea here is to
2:28:34
get your ad in front of the right audience. when they could see your display banner, your banner ad, then
2:28:40
it's going to be more visual, more appealing, generate some brand interest, and hopefully you can get somebody to
2:28:46
click on that ad and over to your website. So, that's paid advertising again through search, through social,
2:28:53
through display. But you can also promote your site on social media. So, once your content has gone live, you
2:28:59
could take advantage of different social media platforms. I mean, it really depends on what you're trying to promote
2:29:06
because what you're trying to promote needs to align with the appropriate social media platform. So, Facebook is
2:29:13
best suited for industries like food and beverages and news and media. And if you're selling a product, so you fall
2:29:19
under one of those categories, then Facebook could be the right platform for you. If you're involved in again beauty
2:29:26
or food and beverage or e-commerce, then you can also leverage Instagram which is
2:29:31
part of Facebook's ecosystem. So if you advertise on Facebook, you can also
2:29:37
advertise on Instagram andor Instagram. So it doesn't have to be and Facebook
2:29:42
and Instagram. It could be Facebook or Instagram. You also have LinkedIn as a platform. LinkedIn is great for B2B. So,
2:29:49
if you're trying to promote industry news or or tips and best practices or
2:29:54
job postings, then LinkedIn is the place for you. It's a B2B platform. It's great
2:30:01
for targeting specific industries, targeting specific job levels or job
2:30:07
descriptions. Okay, so LinkedIn is great if you're into B2B, focusing on the
2:30:12
business side of it. So, you also have YouTube. Now, YouTube is part of Google's ecosystem. YouTube is a video
2:30:20
platform. Okay, so it's great if you're trying to promote gaming or entertainment or if you're a vlogger.
2:30:26
Okay, so YouTube's a great way to promote your site uh by getting your product out there in the form of a
2:30:33
video. Then you have Twitter. Twitter to me encompasses a lot of different industries, beauty and fitness, news and
2:30:40
media, entertainment. Okay, you have limited number of characters, but a lot
2:30:46
of people are active on Twitter and it's a great way to generate some awareness and get some clicks over to your
2:30:52
website. So, these are just some of the most popular social media platforms. Of course, there are plenty more out there.
2:30:59
The third way in which you can drive traffic to your site is guest post blogging. So, most of you already know
2:31:05
what blogging is all about. Well, if you're blogging for your own site, you can jump on somebody else's site and
2:31:10
blog on their behalf. So, having the opportunity to guest post on another
2:31:16
website can be very helpful because one, that other blog could have lots of traffic and have a a well-known brand.
2:31:23
So, if you're blogging on another blog, it's going to build your brand awareness and potentially increase traffic to your
2:31:29
blog or website. So, it exposes to you to targeted traffic. So, if you're going
2:31:35
to guest blog, guest blog on a site that's very relevant to your business or industry. That way, you're targeting the
2:31:42
right audience, okay? You can expand your personal network. So, getting yourself out there, getting your brand
2:31:48
out there in front of a different audience. And then obviously for SERs because it generates a backlink. So,
2:31:53
SERs search engine ranking pages means that hey, if you want to rank organically, you're going to have to
2:32:00
generate some backlinks. So guest blogging is an a way to generate some
2:32:05
back links to your site and in effect that's going to help you get your pages
2:32:10
ranked higher because Google's going to recognize the relationship from one blog
2:32:15
to your blog and build up your relevancy. So some other benefits here
2:32:21
to guest blogging is you can grow your social media pl following because you can then promote that on social media
2:32:28
that you're guest blogging. Okay. Again, you can improve your online authority. Okay. Because when you're guest blogging
2:32:35
and you have recognition on that guest blog, if it's a popular blog, then it's going to help your domain and page
2:32:40
authority for SEO. And then the end result is going to improve your backlink score. So, a lot of benefits to guest
2:32:47
blogging. To me, at the end of the day, it's just about reaching out to your audience using another platform to do
2:32:54
that in the form of a blog. And the results of that is going to mean more brand awareness for you and turning that
2:33:00
traffic from that other blog into qualified leads. So you can also interview industry thought leaders. So
2:33:07
that's another way an interesting way to generate traffic to your site. So reaching out to thought leaders for
2:33:13
interviews, okay, could generate some credibility for you and the other person. So it's reciprocal. So it means
2:33:20
that you're active in the industry that you're in and it allows you to engage with other leaders in the industry and
2:33:28
the indirect net result of that could be increased traffic because if you do the interview and you record it or if it's
2:33:35
via video then you can obviously post it on other platforms and that could in turn drive traffic to your website.
2:33:42
Obviously just like guest blogging it's going to increase your reach. So getting yourself out there. If nobody knows who
2:33:48
your brand is and they know who the thought leaders are and they see you're interviewing the thought leaders, then
2:33:55
that's going to put you in front of these people and so it's going to increase your reach. Another way to
2:34:01
drive traffic to your website is just to make sure your website's responsive. And what do we mean by responsive? Well, we
2:34:07
mean does it work on multiple devices, specifically mobile. So depending on the
2:34:13
device, your website hides, shows, shrinks, enlarges, or moves content so
2:34:19
that it conforms to the browser that that person's looking at on your for
2:34:25
your website. So if somebody's looking on mobile at your website, you want to make sure that your website adjust
2:34:30
accordingly. So you want to be able to, you know, test to make sure it's responsive. And so is content arranged
2:34:37
based on importance. Okay? Does it work across different browsers on different devices? And do the images, text, and
2:34:45
everything else align just like it does on desktop? So, there are plenty of tools out there on the web. All you need
2:34:51
to do is just do a search for, you know, check my website for responsiveness, you know. So, you you can use plenty of
2:34:57
tools to check to see if your website is responsive towards multiple devices. Why
2:35:03
is that important? Because if somebody goes to your website via mobile and your site doesn't align properly or the
2:35:10
content's all stretched out and somebody has to maneuver their browser just to see your website, then chances are
2:35:17
they're not going to come back. Chances are they're not even going to convert. Okay? So, you want to be able to revise
2:35:23
your device browser combinations. You want to make sure that everything works accordingly. You want to be able to test
2:35:29
those fonts, make sure they look good. And then you also want to make sure that
2:35:34
people can navigate. So if they're on mobile, are they going to navigate just as easy as they can on desktop? And if
2:35:41
you have any popups, you want to probably make sure they're removed. So that way when somebody's looking at your
2:35:47
website, they're not getting interfered with on mobile. And then of course, you
2:35:53
want to make sure that these pages load. Okay? So they load just as quick on
2:35:58
desktop as they should on mobile and vice versa. So this should not take a long time to load. So moving on from
2:36:06
responsiveness on mobile to building a brand community. So brand community refers to a group of people who identify
2:36:13
your brand and use your brand as a platform to exchange ideas and contribute content. Some advantages of
2:36:20
having a brand community are promoting brand evangelism and loyalty. It can be
2:36:25
a source of feedback, loyalty and ideas. So build a community, build a brand
2:36:30
community who you know identify with you. Okay? So continue to, you know,
2:36:36
treat these people as loyal customers. Okay? Maybe give them a promotion uh to
2:36:42
use specifically just for them that they can use on your website or talk directly to them because you know that they're
2:36:50
followers, they're repeat customers, they purchase from you multiple times. So talk to them differently as well. you
2:36:56
know who these people are. And that's what building a brand's all about. It's about identifying your brand with other
2:37:03
people, okay? And then identify people who identify with your brand and messaging and talking to them as if
2:37:09
they're part of your own community, your own family. So you can use usergenerated
2:37:15
content that provides future marketing strategies. So the feedback you get from
2:37:20
your own community could be in turn used to promote or used in future marketing
2:37:26
strategies i.e. advertising i.e. post on social. Okay. It can also provide PR
2:37:33
opportunities. So it's a chance for you to you know put out press releases based on the community that you build. So any
2:37:41
brand regardless of who it is should be able to identify with your audience,
2:37:46
their target audience. And that target audience eventually going to become part of a community. These are group of
2:37:53
people who identify with you. What you're trying to sell, what your cause is, what your mission statement is, what
2:37:59
your service is, they identify with you. So leverage them and reciprocate.
2:38:05
Identify them. Talk to them separately. give them the what they deserve, the
2:38:11
respect and loyalty that they deserve as well because they're communicating and they're following you as a brand. So the
2:38:18
next thing you could do to drive traffic is be active in the comment section. So
2:38:23
engage in relevant and thoughtprovoking conversations on other blogs and sites.
2:38:29
It doesn't necessarily have to be another blog per se. It could be other sites like Reddit or Kora or Media,
2:38:36
sites that have a lot of content that are broken out by industry that allow you to engage in conversation that allow
2:38:43
you to either upvote or share or respond. Okay? So, be active because
2:38:49
when you're active, people are going to see that, hey, you're a leader in the industry. You know what you're talking
2:38:54
about. You have some some brand equity. you have some thought and some knowledge
2:39:00
on the specific topic and subject. So, it just puts you in a better light when you can respond and be active on these
2:39:08
different platforms. Okay, let's turn our attention to search engine optimization, also known as SEO or
2:39:15
organic search. So, in order to drive traffic to your site, you're going to
2:39:20
have to implement an SEO strategy. Why do you want to implement an SEO
2:39:25
strategy? because it can help you improve your overall searchability and visibility on search engines and
2:39:32
obviously that comes with advantages. One of those advantages is obviously more traffic to the site. Search is
2:39:38
still king in terms of volumes of people using search on a daily basis. So you
2:39:44
have a great opportunity to be found. It also builds trust and credibility because still a majority of the people
2:39:51
who do a search click on an organic search listing. And so if you're found
2:39:56
organically and you're ranked number one, then chances are somebody's going to click on your listing. And it
2:40:04
provides increased engagement and traffic. And so what that means is more traffic, more engagement. And engagement
2:40:10
is something you define. It could be again a download of a document or the clicking on the play button of a video
2:40:17
or or submitting a form or signing up for a newsletter or calling. These are
2:40:23
all forms of engagement. So then the amount of traffic you drive from organic
2:40:28
search to your website is only going to improve engagement. Okay. So you can
2:40:34
also provide an improved user experience. And what do we mean by that? Well, if you're getting lots of traffic
2:40:40
from organic search, you have a really good opportunity to do AB testing. And
2:40:45
when you do AB testing, you can improve user experience. meaning you're showing one variation against the other from
2:40:52
people coming from organic search. And so this is helpful and that you know if
2:40:58
you're running an AB test, the variation has a chance to improve or outperform
2:41:04
the original. And if it outperforms the original, you're improving user experience. And then it helps target
2:41:09
quality traffic. So SEO to me or all search is the only medium in which
2:41:15
you're meeting somebody halfway. you're you're addressing what they're looking for. So, if somebody's looking for a
2:41:20
pair of red women's Nike shoes, the 2019
2:41:26
model, and you have that particular product to offer, well, you have a
2:41:31
chance of showing up via organic search. somebody types in, you know, women's red
2:41:36
Nike shoes, size whatever at the year 2019 model, then of course they're going
2:41:43
to probably likely click on your listing because you have what they're looking for. And and that goes with any keyword,
2:41:50
any industry, any business, any segment, any type of product you're selling. So
2:41:56
again, you have a chance to really be visible for what people are looking for. And so that's the beauty of search
2:42:02
engine optimization. And you have a really good opportunity here to meet people halfway to drive quality traffic
2:42:09
to get them to enjoy a good user experience all the while generating engagement and along with SEO we want to
2:42:17
be able to build backlinks. So SEO is a two-pronged approach meaning you have
2:42:22
two strategies in one onpage and off- page. And so off-page involves
2:42:27
backlinking. So back links are just links that direct users from other
2:42:33
websites to your own website. So with that inherently it's going to drive traffic, qualified traffic to your
2:42:39
website because if somebody's on a relevant website that's linking to yours and they click on that link and go to
2:42:45
your website, it's likely going to be qualified, meaning they're going to be relevant. And so backlinking because
2:42:52
it's an off- page strategy. Why is it an off- page SEO strategy? Because if Google crawls that other site that has a
2:42:59
link to you, then that's going to give you credit because Google's going to say, "Hey, this site's getting some
2:43:04
links from some relevant sites. We must think they're relevant and therefore we're going to trust this site." So, by
2:43:12
Google trusting your site, it's going to improve your organic ranking. And with
2:43:17
the organic rankings being improved, meaning it's going to mean faster indexing. So, what does that mean? So,
2:43:24
you want to be indexed by the search engines. And so, the quicker Google can find your pages, even if it's on
2:43:31
somebody else's site, then that means they're going to follow that link, go to that page on your site, and take that
2:43:37
page back to their servers to be indexed. Okay? So, the quicker you can get indexed, the quicker you can get found. And then it helps with referral
2:43:43
traffic. So, again, we noticed that our efforts are on SEO, organic search, but
2:43:49
if you're getting traffic from another website, hey, that still counts. That's referral traffic. Okay. So that's a side
2:43:56
advantage to having backlinks is good traffic from other sites. Okay. So those
2:44:02
those are inherently the some of the reasons to do backlinking. Okay. Never hurts. I mean there's brand awareness
2:44:08
reasons to being on other sites as well. There's industry leadership meaning if you you you post content on Reddit.
2:44:15
Okay. You're coming across as an industry leader but yet generating a backlink which helps with SEO and referral traffic. So there's a lot of
2:44:22
benefits to building back links and the opposite of backlinks are internal
2:44:27
links. So you want to do internal linking and that just means connecting one page on your site to another. And
2:44:35
why is that beneficial? Because it can help direct visitors to other pages they wouldn't normally otherwise find via
2:44:42
your navigation. So if you're active on a blog, don't be afraid to include
2:44:48
multiple internal links. You want to move people through your site. You want the flow of traffic to go from one page
2:44:54
to another to another. And so when you do internal linking, just like with backlinks, it's going to improve the
2:45:00
indexing of your website. Google's going to follow those links and index those pages. And Google does give credit from
2:45:07
an SEO perspective, from an internal linking perspective. So if one page is
2:45:13
linked to another and that page has really good relevance in the eyes of Google, then the other page is probably
2:45:18
going to benefit from that. The other reason you want to do internal linking, again, you want to move people from your one page of your site to the other. And
2:45:25
when you do that, it's going to reduce bounce rates. So bounce rate is simply the rate at which people land on a page
2:45:32
and then leave. So, if I have a 100 people land on my homepage and only one person went to another page and the
2:45:38
other 99 left the site, then that's a 99% bounce rate. So, by putting internal
2:45:45
links in place, you're helping people move from one page to the other and thus
2:45:50
reducing the bounce rate. And that's what you want. You want to keep people on your site. You want to be greedy. It
2:45:56
also drives traffic to older posts. So again, when we say older post, we're really referring to blog post. So if you
2:46:03
have a relevant blog post and you're writing a new blog post, then link the
2:46:08
two together. If it's relevant, link it. I don't, you know, regardless of how old it is. You know, you want to show Google
2:46:14
that these older blog posts, just because they were written a year ago, doesn't mean they're outdated and old-fashioned, okay? Or useless. You
2:46:21
want to keep them alive by linking to them. So to me, that's a good strategy for internal linking. link to older blog
2:46:28
post. You know, show people you're an industry expert, you've been doing this for a while, and you have lots of
2:46:33
content to share. Okay? So, the longer you can keep somebody on your website, the more likely it is they're going to
2:46:40
engage and convert. And some other inherent benefits, improves page rank. So, what we mean by page rank is simply
2:46:47
just a rank that Google gives pages. So, the more internal linking you have, the better off you are. And then it helps
2:46:53
spread link juice across websites. And what we mean by link juice again just like backlinking it builds relevancy. So
2:47:01
just keep all these inherent benefits in mind to internal linking the end result is keeping the flow of traffic on your
2:47:07
site and all these other benefits will fall into place. Okay. So another way in
2:47:13
which you can really hone in on traffic to your website is longtail keywords. And longtail keywords to me are more
2:47:21
than just one or two keyword phrases. Okay? So they're usually three or longer
2:47:27
keywords in a phrase. Okay, so longtail keywords really nowadays account for
2:47:32
most web searches. People really take the time to even post questions as a
2:47:37
search query. Okay, likely somebody, it's unlikely somebody's going to go into search and just type in the word
2:47:43
shoes. They might type in red shoes, but that's unlikely. what they're probably going to type in is, you know, red Nike
2:47:52
running shoes 2019 or some variation of that. Okay, that's a longtail keyword.
2:47:58
And some of the advantages of using longtail keywords to be found for are less competition. So, if you're using
2:48:05
broad keywords like red shoes, then who doesn't want to be found for red shoes? Well, you don't necessarily you don't
2:48:12
want to be found for red shoes because it's too broad. You don't know what type of shoes somebody's looking for. You
2:48:17
just know they're looking for red shoes. It could be running shoes. It could be work shoes. It could be, you know,
2:48:23
boots. It could be slippers. Okay? It's too broad. So, longtail keywords help
2:48:28
narrow it in. And the more narrow and focused a keyword is, the less competition it's going to have. And when
2:48:34
something's not competitive in the form of a keyword, then that means your chances of ranking for that keyword are
2:48:40
going to be greater. and the chances of you ranking faster are going to be greater. And then of course, if somebody's looking for exactly what you
2:48:46
have to offer, then you have a higher chance to convert that person. So, if you have exactly those 2019 red Nike
2:48:53
women's running shoes and somebody does a search for that and that's a longtail keyword and they click on your organic
2:48:59
listing, if you have the right price, then they're probably going to convert. So, you have a really good chance of
2:49:05
converting somebody using longtail keywords. So my point here is if you're looking for keywords to use, focus on
2:49:11
longer tail. Don't focus on one or two keyword phrases. What it also does is brings targeted traffic. So even if
2:49:18
somebody doesn't convert, hey, they could be back because it's exactly what they're looking for. And if you're
2:49:25
focusing on longer tail keywords, like I just mentioned, stay away from the shorter ones. It's just easier to
2:49:31
optimize your page for SEO. So remember, SEO is a two-pronged approach. Onpage
2:49:37
and off- page. We talked about off- page with internal linking and back links. On page is all about making sure those
2:49:44
keywords you choose are integrated in with the page you want to be found for.
2:49:49
And so if you're using a longtail keyword, it's just easier to work that keyword in. So it enables easier onpage
2:49:56
optimization. Okay, let's switch away from SEO to email marketing. So let's
2:50:02
focus on email marketing as a form or method of driving traffic to your
2:50:07
website. So email marketing has been around a long time in terms of digital marketing. Why? Because it provides an
2:50:13
effective way to convert leads into sales. Why? Because you can send personalized emails to a target
2:50:20
audience. So when you send an email to somebody on a regular basis, you know who that person is. So what are you
2:50:26
doing in the email? you're writing a specific message to that person. Well, email marketing is the same thing except
2:50:33
you're just sending an email to a larger group of people. And when you send an email to a larger group of people,
2:50:40
you're still going to personalize the message, right? You're not going to send a generic email to 1,000 people, okay?
2:50:47
Nobody's going to do that. So, make sure your email is targeted. And if it's targeted, it could be cost effective.
2:50:53
Why? Because sending large amounts of emails or let's just say an email to a
2:50:58
large amount of people or a large group of people is going to be cost effective. It's not cost per click, you know, it's
2:51:05
not cost per open. Okay? So, email usually depending on the the email
2:51:10
provider you're using really is a flat fee. So, it just really depends on how many emails you're sending or how how
2:51:17
many people you're sending the email to as well. So, but email generally tends
2:51:23
to be more cost effective than other forms of marketing. So, look at the email content provider you're using and
2:51:29
just get a sense of what they charge. But if you look at it and do a comparison, email generally is cheaper
2:51:35
than say doing pay-per-click because with pay-per-click you're paying for each click. Okay? So, that could be
2:51:41
expensive depending on the keywords. So, email marketing is also timesaving. Okay? Meaning it's a one-time thing and
2:51:48
done. So once you send the email, it's just a matter of, you know, watching and
2:51:53
looking at the metrics and learning what's going on so you don't make the same mistakes again. But it is time
2:51:59
conducive, meaning you send out one email and that's it. With pay-per-click, you're constantly measuring and managing
2:52:06
the campaigns. And it provides real-time marketing. So when you do send the email, more than likely majority of the
2:52:12
people on day one or the day you send the email are going to be able to view
2:52:17
it, open it, click on some of the links and convert. So that's normally what
2:52:22
happens. An email, majority of the people open it on day one and it kind of tails off from there. So think about it
2:52:28
as real time. So when you send that email and if you have a thousand people on your email recipient list, break it
2:52:34
up. send the first 500 first with a different subject line and then you can
2:52:39
see the data come in. And if you don't see the good results from the subject
2:52:44
line or the body of the email or you know the page they're going to then make adjustments before you send the other
2:52:50
email to the next 500. So that's a great thing about emails. You can break up the email into two groups. The first group
2:52:57
and then the second group with different subject lines and you can probably send them a little bit of time apart. That
2:53:03
way you can learn from the first email because with email you are generally going to get results right away. Okay,
2:53:10
within the first 24 hours. So that's a great thing about email. Okay, so the other thing about email, it's less
2:53:17
intrusive. So normally people who are going to get the email are the ones who
2:53:22
sign up for the email. So they're almost expecting your email. So when they get your email, again, as long as you're not
2:53:29
sending an email on a daily basis, normally most companies send it monthly or bi-weekly, it's not going to be as
2:53:35
intrusive. Okay? And then it also helps build credibility, increase visibility and brand awareness. Meaning, you're
2:53:41
going to build your brand in that email. You're going to put content in that email that's going to show off your
2:53:48
credibility. Meaning, you could put some testimonials in the email. You could put some good affiliations. you can put a
2:53:54
good article to an industry article you just wrote. So, email is going to inherently continue to build brand
2:54:01
awareness for you. Okay? And it's an easy way to track ROI. So, if you're e-commerce, it's pretty clear. You send
2:54:08
the email, somebody opens it, clicks on it, checks out, and purchases something, it's easily trackable because you could
2:54:15
track it right from that email. So, one thing I want to say there is just if you do send an email, make sure you're
2:54:20
tracking that campaign. And you want to be able to use an analytics program like
2:54:26
Google Analytics. If you use Google Analytics, you're going to be able to track when you send the email, who
2:54:32
clicks on it, and who converts. So, you want to be able to measure an ROI for these emails, and you can, and that's
2:54:38
the beauty of email marketing. Okay, let's move away from email marketing to webinars. So, webinars, great method for
2:54:45
effective social media promotion. It's a great way to bring traffic to your website. So why do we recommend
2:54:52
webinars? Well, because it provides direct content contact within your target group. What do we mean by contact
2:55:00
with your target group? Well, you're going to host a webinar and you're going to invite this targeted group of people
2:55:05
who are interested in your product or service. So, if you have a Facebook community, you could do a Facebook live
2:55:11
event or you could do a YouTube or, you know, you can even set up a webinar on
2:55:17
another platform, but promote it on social media. And if you're promoting something on social media, you're
2:55:23
probably promoting it to people who are already following you or like you. And so, that's what we mean by direct
2:55:29
contact with your target group. So, you're you're going to be able to create a webinar and talk directly to that
2:55:35
group. And that's going to help build brand awareness and credibility. And the great thing about webinars is you don't
2:55:41
need some fancy software. I mean, I'm talking to you on a webinar right now. And so webinars are free. All you need
2:55:49
is a video camera and a recorder. That's all. And that's all built in with software. So there's plenty of software
2:55:55
out there that allows you just to do a webinar really quick and easy. There's lots of opportunities in software. So,
2:56:02
and a lot of them are very coste effective. So if you want to build uh create a webinar, you can do that by
2:56:08
spending very little money. And webinars again allow you to talk to your targeted
2:56:14
group, your community, maybe prospective clients. It helps build credibility and
2:56:19
in effect drive traffic to your website. And when somebody does attend a webinar, they're likely going to be highly
2:56:25
engaged because you're inviting them. They're going to opt into the webinar. And the great thing about webinars is
2:56:31
even if they don't attend the webinar the day you have it, it's going to be recorded so they can always go back and
2:56:38
watch it. So whoever watches the webinar is going to be engaged because it's going to be a topic they're interested
2:56:43
in. And then users are likely to become prospective customers. So having a webinar talking about something
2:56:50
inherently interesting to maybe a larger group of people, you can promote that on
2:56:56
social media and potentially get prospective customers to sign up and watch the webinar. And if you do,
2:57:03
they're going to be engaged and then take the next step. Oh, I like what this guy, this person has to say. They seem
2:57:10
to be credible. I like their personality. I like their brand. I like their product. I'm going to go check
2:57:15
their web out their website. Okay. So, webinars allow you to kind of pull in more people as well as just your
2:57:21
community because you can promote the webinar and you can promote it in advance and you can leverage social
2:57:27
media for that. Okay. So, something related to webinars incorporating video
2:57:32
content. So videos have been proven to be a really good way to attract new
2:57:37
visitors and it just it makes your website very engaging when you have videos on your website as well. So if
2:57:45
you create video, you have an opportunity to post it on various video platforms like YouTube or Vimeo. Okay,
2:57:52
there's plenty of video platforms out there or just embed it in a blog post or
2:57:57
embed it in a Facebook post or a tweet. Okay. So, you can do a lot with video
2:58:03
and having video on your site is going to increase engagement. Okay. When you
2:58:08
increase engagement, good things happen. That's going to lead to increased conversions and sales or or ROI or just
2:58:16
like we mentioned the webinar can help build trust with your audience. So, even that webinar you could post on your
2:58:22
website. So, you want people to engage by watching this video. they watch the video, they're going to gain trust in
2:58:29
you because you're talking directly to that person, that user, that audience, that visitor to your website. And when
2:58:35
you can build trust, it's going to increase engagement. And that's the beauty of video. Unlike text or imagery,
2:58:43
videos really do engage with the audience. And so, the more video you can do, the better off you are because
2:58:49
again, you can leverage social to draw attention to your brand and product and service. And then you can have that
2:58:55
video on your website to increase engagement which in turn increases conversions and sales and improves ROI.
2:59:03
So always think video. There's plenty of video software out there that you can leverage. And the great thing about
2:59:08
video too is hey most people are using mobile phones these days, smartphones.
2:59:14
And so video works just as well on mobile as it does on desktop. So keep that in mind. you know, video is going
2:59:21
to be engaging regardless of what device somebody uses. And then, of course, if they're watching the video on Facebook
2:59:28
or YouTube, then it chances are they're going to share that particular video,
2:59:34
which is going to bode well for your brand and traffic. Okay? So, video, if somebody likes a video, it's very easy
2:59:40
to share video, especially from a mobile phone. So, YouTube just makes it so easy to share or like or subscribe to a
2:59:48
channel. it just it becomes that much easier. Things can go viral and chances
2:59:54
of them going viral with video are going to be greater. Okay, so other ways to drive traffic to your website is submit
3:00:00
your content to content aggregators. So what's a content aggregator? Well, a content aggregator is like Reddit that
3:00:07
provides a great platform for you to post your content. So that's what a content aggregator is really a site like
3:00:12
Reddit or Medium or Kora where you could post content to a large number of people. Okay, so with Reddit, people are
3:00:20
either going to upvote it or downvote it. So the more up votes you get or thumbs up or likes or people who
3:00:27
encourage that content, the more of a chance it has to be found. And so first
3:00:33
thing out of the gate, if you do provide content to a content aggregator like Reddit, make sure it's good quality
3:00:39
content that's interesting. And that should be a case the case across the board, whether it's a a social post or
3:00:45
blog post. Make sure the content's unique, professional, and interesting. And then if you do say put something on
3:00:52
Medium or you do put something on Kora and it is professional and interesting
3:00:57
and thoughtprovoking, then people are going to react to it. And then that again could lead to traffic, but even if
3:01:03
it doesn't lead to traffic, it helps build brand awareness. So if you have content, just like videos, leverage it.
3:01:09
Put the content out there. Okay? And when you put content out there, it's only going to, especially if it's good
3:01:15
content, put it's going to put you in a good light. So don't be afraid to share your content on the likes of Reddit or
3:01:22
Medium or Core or some of these other content aggregator websites because good
3:01:27
things are only going to happen. And again, referral traffic, SEO, brand
3:01:33
awareness, conversions. So all these are inherent benefits of just sharing your
3:01:38
content. Okay. Okay. And then finally, we want to learn from analytics. Okay. So, what do I mean learning from
3:01:44
analytics? So, there are plenty of analytics platforms out there. One of the most popular is Google Analytics.
3:01:50
So, you want to make sure you're tracking traffic on your site with Google Analytics. So, all you have to do
3:01:55
is just go to Google Analytics via search, sign up, add the Analytics code to your website, and voila, they're
3:02:02
doing all the heavy lifting. They're going to track traffic coming to your website. And not only they going to
3:02:07
track traffic, but they're going to tell you how that traffic engaged. And so the benefits of Google Analytics is, hey,
3:02:14
you could figure out where users are coming from. Are they coming from that email campaign that I sent out to a
3:02:20
thousand people? Are they coming from YouTube based on that video I posted? Or are they coming from Reddit based on the
3:02:26
content I just posted there? Or they coming from organic search? it. So, Google Analytics can help us understand
3:02:34
how much traffic we're getting from organic search. So, it'll help us measure our SEO efforts. And then with
3:02:40
Google Analytics, you could segment. So, we could segment by mobile, we can segment by desktop, returning user, new
3:02:47
user, by campaign, by page, by language, by city, by region. I mean, there's so
3:02:54
many ways in which to segment your audience. And segmenting simply is breaking up the entire group of people
3:03:01
who come to your website into different segments based on what you want to see. So if you want to look at, you know,
3:03:08
females between the ages of 18 to 24 who come from mobile via organic search,
3:03:14
that's a segment and you can look at that information in analytics. If that's your target audience, then you could see
3:03:21
how they're performing. Okay, so anal there are a lot of benefits to Google Analytics. definitely want to take
3:03:27
advantage of of segmenting in Google Analytics. You could look at your competition. So there's a benchmarking
3:03:33
report. The great thing about Google Analytics, you can also look at content and how your content is performing once
3:03:39
somebody lands on your website. Are they what page are they spending time on? What page are they engaging on the most?
3:03:46
Okay, what pages have the highest bounce rate or the lowest time on page? So you can really determine what pages work
3:03:52
best. And then of course the end result in analyzing all this data is you want
3:03:58
to be able to fine-tune your website. So take advantage of the data that Google Analytics or any other analytics
3:04:05
platform is giving you by learning. Once you learn what's going on with your website, you can make adjustments to
3:04:12
your website to improve user experience. Okay, so we went over a lot of different
3:04:19
ways to drive traffic. Imagine you started a small business, but it feels like no one knows it's there. That's
3:04:26
tough, right? But today, we are going to help you change that. In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to use

3:27:03
we have covered a lot today from setting up email campaigns, creating automation, building a website and also appointments
3:27:12
but for that you need to have an upgraded. Let me ask you something. Have you ever searched for pizza near me or
3:27:18
best plumber in town on Google? What's the first thing you notice? probably the
3:27:23
businesses that pop up at the very top of the page or on Google Maps, right? That's the magic of SEO. Now, if you're
3:27:30
wondering what's SEO, don't worry. Let me break it down for you. SEO stands for
3:27:35
search engine optimization, and it's how businesses make their websites and profiles to show up higher in Google
3:27:42
search results. But why does it matter? Because if people can't find your business online, they can't become your
3:27:49
customers. Studies show that 97% of people search online for local
3:27:54
businesses before making a purchase or booking a service. And here's the thing, SEO isn't just for websites. If you own
3:28:01
a local business, your Google My Business profile is your ticket to being discovered. So, what exactly is Google
3:28:08
My Business or as they now call it, Google business profile? It's like an online business card, but so much more
3:28:15
powerful. You can showcase your address, phone number, photos, reviews, and even
3:28:20
updates about your business, and it's completely free. Let's say you run a
3:28:25
bakery. When someone nearby searches for best chocolate cake shop near me, your Google business profile can make your
3:28:32
bakery pop up right at the top on Google Maps and in local search results. That's
3:28:38
why optimizing your Google business profile is so important. Without it, your business might not even show up and
3:28:44
you could lose customers to competitors. In this video, I'll take you step by step through how to create and register
3:28:51
your Google My Business profile, how to optimize it for better rankings, free tools you can use to analyze and improve
3:28:58
your profile, and some pro tips to beat your competitors. So, let's get started.
3:29:04
So, first, let's get started with how to create and register your Google My Business profile. So, first let's talk
3:29:10
about how to create your profile. It's very super simple and it only takes a few minutes. Just simply go to Google
3:29:16
and just search Google My Business Sign in. And from here, you have to just sign
3:29:21
into this account. If you don't have one, you just have to create your account. It's free
3:29:27
to use. So, the next step is you can enter your business name. Make sure that it matches with your brand. So the name
3:29:35
of my business is the Baker's Corner. Just simply click on
3:29:41
continue. Now this third step is to choose your business type. It's very
3:29:46
important because it tells Google what kind of business you are. For example, if you run a coffee shop, you can choose
3:29:54
coffee shop as your primary category. So from here, you can just select your
3:29:59
category if it's an online retail or a local store. In my case, it's a local store. So, I'll just click on this. Now,
3:30:06
you have to enter a business category. It's cake shop.
3:30:12
Okay. Now, click on next. Now, you have to enter your business
3:30:17
address. It's in my layout. Let's suppose Bangalore South and your status.
3:30:23
So, we have entered our address also over here. And then we'll click next.
3:30:30
So here you can also enter your contact details if you want your customers to contact you by your number. So it's an
3:30:37
alternate choice. You can add your number or you can also skip. So you can also put your business
3:30:44
on the map. Start connecting with your customers across Google all in one place. Uh if you put your business on
3:30:50
the map then you'll get discovered by people in your area. Respond to reviews for your business. Let's say u if
3:30:56
somebody is searching for a cake shop near me. So they will obviously see your business list over there on the
3:31:03
map. So you can just stick on this if you want to. Otherwise you can just select
3:31:11
continue. So now a verification code will be sent to your particular number number you have registered. So just
3:31:18
simply enter the code sent to your uh SMS. As you can see, it's showing that
3:31:26
you're now verified. So, verifying your profile is very important. Google will send a code to your address or also your
3:31:34
number. And then you have to just enter the verification code and you're all set. So, here just simply click on next.
3:31:40
Now, the next thing is customizing your profile. So, you have to let your
3:31:45
customers know when are you open for businesses. So, let's say I want my business to be closed on Sundays. So
3:31:52
I'll just click on open on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday as
3:31:58
well as on Saturday. And from here, what timings do you want to be opened at?
3:32:03
Let's say it should start from 8:00 a.m. in the morning and it will be closing on
3:32:08
let's say 11:30. Same we will be adding for this also.
3:32:20
So now you can just simply click on next after entering your timings. And now an
3:32:25
important step is to add your business description. You have to let your customers learn about your business by
3:32:31
adding a particular description about your business profile. So if when somebody's searching about your shop, it
3:32:37
should describe that what your bakery shop or your cake shop is about and what
3:32:42
you know items are available there. So here I'm adding my description. So my description says about where is it
3:32:48
located the baker's corner known for its cozy ambience and what it's offering like pastries crunchy breads and now
3:32:56
just click on next make sure that your description consists of good SEO
3:33:01
keywords so that it will rank in your Google map. Now an important step is to
3:33:07
adding photos of your store. So make sure that you upload a high quality picture. So just select click on
3:33:14
pictures over here.
3:33:22
So as you can see we have uploaded the images of a store over here and then we move on to the next step. So now the
3:33:29
next step is customizing your profile if you want to claim your 2,000 rupees advertising credit. So if you click on
3:33:35
this option advertising what will happen is when somebody's searching for cake shop in the nearby area Bangalore south
3:33:42
then it will show as an advertisement and your cake shop will be listed on the top of the Google ranking. So it's not
3:33:49
that important. If you want to go for advertising you can but for this time we're just clicking on the skip
3:33:55
option. You can do it later if you want to. Now you can also get a custom domain
3:34:00
name for your website and custom email address as well. and be just skipping this option. So
3:34:07
your edits will be visible once you're verified. So now we have created a business profile live but uh creating is
3:34:14
just one step. Let's now talk about how do we optimize it. So creating a Google business profile is now live but
3:34:21
creating is just one more step. Now let's understand why is Google my business so important for local SEO.
3:34:27
First of all, it boosts your visibility. A well optimized profile helps your business rank higher in the Google local
3:34:33
three-pack and on Google map as well putting you right in front of people searching for your services. Second of
3:34:41
all, it builds trust. When customers see a complete profile with updated information, good reviews, and even
3:34:47
pictures, they are far more likely to choose your business. And here's the big thing. It drives sales. Nearly 30% of
3:34:55
your local searches lead to purchases. sometimes on the same day. Exactly. Even
3:35:00
your GMBB profile enhances engagement. Customers can call, message, visit your website, or even get directions directly
3:35:08
from your listing. It's also like running a free advertising for your business 24 into 7. No other platform
3:35:15
gives you so much visibility without spending a dime. Simply put, if you want more customers and better local
3:35:21
rankings, you need a well optimized Google My Business profile. Now, let's talk about how does Google determine
3:35:27
local rankings. It all comes down to three main factors. First, there's relevance. It's all about how well your
3:35:34
businesses matches with what the searcher is looking for. For example, if someone searches pizza delivery, Google
3:35:41
will prioritize businesses that clearly offer pizza and delivery services. Next,
3:35:47
we are talking about is distance. How close your business is to the searchers location. If two businesses are equally
3:35:54
relevant, Google will usually favor the one that's closer to the user. Finally,
3:35:59
there is prominence. This is all about how well-known and trusted your business is. Google looks at things like customer
3:36:06
reviews, back links, articles about your businesses and even offline reputation
3:36:11
to measure this. The more trust and authority you build, the better your chances are of ranking higher. Now, we
3:36:18
have discussed about this. Now let's talk about how do you optimize a Google business profile. So for this uh you
3:36:23
just simply have to fill out all the details completely. The more information you provide the better include your
3:36:29
business hours. Also include catchy business descriptions. Don't leave anything blank. Google reward businesses
3:36:36
with complete profile by ranking them higher. Adding highquality pictures, collecting Google reviews, everything is
3:36:43
very important for ranking your business. So as you can see after you have verified your account you can just
3:36:49
simply come to this page over here and from here you can just edit your profile if you want to business category the
3:36:56
business name if you want to change the description if you want to just enhance more the opening date also you can add
3:37:02

3:37:13
location areas us what service area you are providing. So can add more places.
3:37:20
Okay, I'm just adding more places near me. So when people are searching for
3:37:27
nearby cake shop, they will also go through my business name. So now just click on save after you have edited your
3:37:34
uh description over here. And then you have so many options like planning, payments, parking, offering, dining
3:37:41
options, more from business just we can add more hours also breakfast, brunch,
3:37:48
happy hours. You can also add a list name as special hours which you want your guest to be known and these are our
3:37:56
opening hours which we have already entered before. This is the location over here
3:38:03
and the contact info. So we have gone through this edit profile. Next the step is our reviews. Your reviews are very
3:38:09
important. So for this time we do not have any reviews yet. But make sure that
3:38:15
you get plenty of reviews as much as you have because this will help your
3:38:20
business to rank higher on the SEO because Google will select that particular business. it will favor it
3:38:26
more if you have good number of reviews and you know more replies you're giving to that reviews because it will show
3:38:33
that it's a genuine and authorized business. Now the next step is also adding your pictures and which we have
3:38:40
already added before. Next we are talking about as performance. So you can just see from here you can enter the
3:38:47
time period and the overview business profile interactions at what time your profile is getting interactive mode. You

SEO ensuring your site is fast, secure and mobile friendly. SEO is crucial for
3:51:37
digital marketing because higher visibility leads to increased website traffic, brand awareness, and
3:51:43
conversions. Unlike paid ads, SEO brings sustainable long-term results when
3:51:48
implemented effectively. So SEO helps businesses connect with the right audience at the right time through
3:51:54
meaningful and valuable content. So in short, this is what exactly is SEO. Now
3:52:01
let us move ahead and try to understand what is AEO. So guys, AEO stands for
3:52:07
answer engine optimization. It is a process of optimizing content to provide direct concise answers to user queries
3:52:14
especially through AI powered tools like voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant and chatbots like Chat
3:52:21
GBD, Google Gemini and etc. So unlike traditional SEO which focuses on driving
3:52:27
users to website via search engine rankings, AU aims to deliver instant
3:52:32
voicefriendly responses that don't always require visiting a web page. AU involves structuring content using
3:52:39
schema markups, FAQs, and conversational formats so that AI systems can easily
3:52:45
extract and understand the information. It's designed to satisfy users who prefer quick answers like those using
3:52:51
smart speakers or mobile devices without needing to scroll through the search results. Now, AEO is becoming essential
3:52:58
as voice search grows and AI becomes more embedded in how people access information. So, guys, by focusing on
3:53:05
clarity, context, and structure, AO is actually helping businesses stay visible
3:53:10
in the AI powered answer for search environment. So this was a short sum up of what exactly is SEO and what is AEO.
3:53:19
Now let us discuss some of the core differences of AEO and SEO based on
3:53:24
certain parameters. So guys, our first parameter is objective and core goal. If
3:53:30
I talk about SEO, the goal of SEO is actually to increase organic traffic to a website by making it rank higher on
3:53:37
the search engine result pages. And SEO helps user to find variety of web pages
3:53:42
related to their type query. For example, if I say uh if someone searches digital marketing tips. So SEO ensures
3:53:50
your blog post appears on page one of the Google. So that's the objective of
3:53:55
SEO is. Now if I talk about AEO which is answer engine optimization, it focuses
3:54:00
on providing direct immediate answers to users question without them needing to
3:54:06
click on multiple links. It is optimized for AI systems like voice assistants and chat bots that pull answers directly
3:54:13
from the structured content. For example, like if someone asks what are the three digital marketing tips for
3:54:19
beginners. Now, Siri or Chad GBT may read out your FAQ or snippet if AEO is
3:54:25
properly implemented. The next goal that we have all over here is content format and structure. So if I talk about SEO
3:54:33
guys, it relies on long- form content with strategic keyword placement. So here content must be informative,
3:54:40
detailed and mediarich meaning images, videos etc. Now it also represents important elements such as meta titles
3:54:46
and description. What are the keyword headings? Are there any backlinks and also the internal linkings? Similarly,
3:54:53
if we discuss about content format and structure for AEO, it is kind of
3:54:59
conversational, scannable and structured for machines. Basically, it focuses on FAQ pages, featured snippets, people
3:55:06
also ask type answers and there is a schema markup like FAQs, how to, product
3:55:12
organization, etc. The next one let us talk about it is one of the most important thing which is user experience
ChatGPT Search Engine
3:55:18
and interaction. If I talk about SEO guys, users manually type keyword, scroll results, click lens, and explore
3:55:26
content. So, it is best for exploratory searches, comparison, and in-depth
3:55:31
learning, which is basically we're talking about SEO. So, the user flow will be something like this. Google read
3:55:38
snippet, click the blog, and then you read the article. Now, if I talk about AU guys, here users ask conversational
3:55:45
or voice- based queries. Best for fast to the point answers. No need for multiple click or page navigation. Now
3:55:52
here the user flow will be something like this. There will be a voice or chant prompt and then there will be
3:55:57
instant spoken text or answer. So that's how AU works. Now let us discuss about
3:56:02
our final point which is keyword strategy and search intent. Basically if I talk about SEO guys, keywords are
3:56:09
usually short and typed. For example like buying running shoes online. So it
3:56:14
focuses on exact match longtail keyword and variations. Now if I talk about AEO
3:56:20
guys here the keywords are natural question based and longer example like what are the best running shoes for
3:56:26
longd distance runner and it is optimized for spoken language and user intent. Now if I sum up all of this so I
3:56:34
come up with certain performance metrics like so SEO basically focuses on organic
3:56:40
traffic, page views, bounce rate, time on site, conversion rate and ranking position. So if you're not familiar with
3:56:47
SEO then look out for digital marketing full course on simply learn where we have covered all these metric points.
3:56:54
Now similarly if I talk about the AU metrics there are snippet placements, voice search visibility, AI chat word
3:57:01
appearance, frequency and also direct answer accuracy is there. So this is how
3:57:06
we judge based on the metrics like how SEO is performing and how AEO is performing. So in short guys this was
3:57:13
the core difference between AEO and SEO. Now let us move ahead and discuss about
3:57:19
how SEO and AO can work together. But before that let's have a use case
3:57:24
comparison. So for example I have built an use case comparison like there is
3:57:30
industry, healthcare, e-commerce, finance and trouble and suppose you type in SEO example. Okay then there will be
3:57:38
a AU example. So suppose if I talk about healthcare so you would see something like blogs on
3:57:45
symptoms of flu and similarly AU is going to give you the novice answer for
3:57:50
the same. What are the early symptoms of fluke? So this is how you interact. Similarly, you just type product pages
3:57:56
for shoes and here you search it on chatbot like what shoes are best for gym
3:58:01
workouts. Similarly, if I talk about finance, so you could say guide on how to save taxes, you would search on
3:58:08
Google something like this. But if you say to Siri like how to save tax under
3:58:13
ATC. So this is a income tax code. Okay. Now similarly for travel you could see
3:58:19
blog on top travel destination and here where I can go for budget vacation in April. So you could see there is slight
3:58:26
variation but end result you are getting uh like what what you want at the end of
3:58:31
the day. So as discussed based on this example I hope so you would have got the
3:58:37
core difference between SEO and EU and as I was telling earlier we will move
3:58:42
forward to understand how both of them can work together. So guys, if I say like while SEO, search engine
3:58:49
optimization and AO, which is standing for answer engine optimization may seem
3:58:55
like separate strategies, but they actually complement each other beautifully when implemented together.
3:59:00
Think of this way guys uh like SEO attracts users to your website and AEO
3:59:07
answers their questions in real time through voice assistant or AI tools and together they are ensuring that your
3:59:14
content is discoverable and usable across both search engines and AI
3:59:19
platforms. Now let us discuss about our first parameter which is serve different
3:59:24
user behaviors. So basically SEO targets users who browse, explore and read
3:59:30
articles and AEO targets users who want quick voice-based or conversational
3:59:36
answers. For example, if I have to say like an SEO optimized blog maybe title something like this, 10 best laptops for
3:59:42
students in 2025. An AU optimized FAQ might answer
3:59:47
what is the best laptop under 50,000 for students. Both help but in different
3:59:52
formats. The next thing is shared content and different presentation. So guys, you don't need separate websites
3:59:59
for SEO and AEO. Instead, create one piece of content and structure it to serve both purposes. SEO strategy, it is
4:00:06
a long form keywordri blog or guide. Whereas AEO strategy could include short summaries, bulletoint answers and FAQs
4:00:13
within the same content. Now there is a some tip which I would like to give you like you can use the same blog to rank
4:00:20
on Google and show up voice answers by embedding structured FAQs. The third one is structured data. So schema markup or
4:00:28
we say structured data is key to helping both search engines and AI will understand your content. If I talk about
4:00:34
SEO benefit, it improves how your content is displayed on search engine results like rich snippets, ratings and
4:00:40
FAQs. where AU benefits like it makes it easier for voice assistants to pull the
4:00:46
exact answer and speak it loud. So this is how we talk about the structured data
4:00:52
and finally we talk about optimization. So you can optimize SEO keywords like
4:00:57
buy affordable DSLR cameras in India or AEO keywords could be like which DSLR is
4:01:03
best under 50,000 in India and your content strategy try to target both short form and natural language queries
4:01:10
which will definitely help you. Now finally let us discuss about our future trends. So if I talk about future trends
4:01:17
of 2025 AEO versus SEO. So like as we are moving into digital era, both SEO
4:01:24
and AEO are evolving rapidly. Actually the traditional SEO will continue to play a vital role and AU will become
4:01:31
indispensable as users increasingly interact with search platforms through voice commands, smart assistants and AI
4:01:38
chatbots. Now the first thing which I am pretty much confident that voice search
4:01:44
will search like with the rise of smart devices like Amazon, Alexa, Google Nest and Apple Siri, voice search is set to
4:01:51
dominate user behavior. So there's a data like over 50% of online searches are expected to be voice- based by 2025.
4:01:58
Users will favor quick hands-free answers especially on mobile and in smart homes. Businesses must be
4:02:05
optimized for conversational queries and natural language to stay relevant. Next is AI chatbots. So AI chatbots will be
4:02:12
the first touch points. So like AI power tools like chat jebidity, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Cloud AI are becoming
4:02:20
the first choice for users seeking information. Then there is a rise of structured data and schema markup.
4:02:25
Google and AI assistants will rely heavily on structured data to understand and present the content. So the business
4:02:32
is using schema markup for example FAQ page product or like how to so it will
4:02:37
gain a huge advantage in this scenario whereas structured content will also appear more often in rich results
4:02:44
knowledge panels or voice answers. The next this is amazing trend guys mobile
4:02:49
first and AI ready content with mobile users surpassing desktops and AI being
4:02:55
integrated into messaging apps and mobile browsers. So the content must be mobile friendly, fast loading and voice
4:03:01
compatible. Google's mobile first indexing means desktop only sites will fall behind. And finally, there will be
4:03:07
a blend of SEO plus AU strategies. So 2025 is not about choosing between SEO
4:03:13
and AU. It's about combining them. So SEO will drive visibility in search
4:03:18
engines and AU will ensure that you're present in AI answers and voice searches. The future of digital search
4:03:25
is multimodel and AI first. This is the first thing I would like to say. And to stay competitive in 2025 and beyond,
4:03:32
marketers must embrace voice first experiences, use AI friendly formats,
4:03:38
merge SEO and AU strategies to be everywhere. And finally, merge SEO and
4:03:44
AU strategies to be everywhere the user is, whether it's a browser, a chatbot or
4:03:49
smart speaker. Imagine giving your website a boost with the power of AI,
4:03:55
helping it climb higher in search results and attract more visitors. Exciting, right? That's exactly what an
4:04:02
SEO audit does. It's like a health check for your site where AI tools can quickly
4:04:08
find the little things that might be showing you down from page speed to broken links and suggest smart ways to
4:04:15
fix them. By using AI to optimize your site, you not only improve how it looks
4:04:21
to search engines like Google, but also give users a smooth, faster experience.
4:04:26
It's a simple but powerful way to get more eyes on your content. Stay ahead of
4:04:31
the competition and make sure your site is always in the tiptop shape. Regular
4:04:37
SEO audits powered by AI are your secret weapon to keep growing and succeeding
4:04:43
online. Now you must be wondering what an SEO audit is. Is it necessary? How to
4:04:48
even perform it? No worries. In this video, I will let you know everything you need to know about SEO audit and how
4:04:55
to perform it as a complete beginner. Without making any delay, let's understand what is an SEO. SEO or search
4:05:03
engine optimization is the process of making a website easier to find on
4:05:08
search engines. It involves using the right keywords, creating helpful content, and ensuring the site loads
4:05:15
quickly and works well on mobile devices. SEO also includes improving individual pages and building links from
4:05:23
other sites. The goal is to help the website rank higher in search results so
4:05:28
more people can discover it. After we have a basic understanding of what SEO
4:05:33
actually is, let us know what is an SEO audit. An SEO audit is a detailed check
4:05:39
of a website to see how well it can be found on search engines. It looks at factors like how fast the site loads, if
4:05:48
it works well on mobile devices, and if the content uses the right keywords or
4:05:53
not. AI tool plays a crucial role in the process by analyzing data more
4:05:58
efficiently, identifying keyword trends and accessing user behavior to provide
4:06:03
insights. The audit also checks how other website links to it and whether
4:06:08
the content is useful for visitors. It examines how easy it is for users to navigate the site and compares it to the
4:06:15
competitors. After the audit, you receive a report with suggestions, often enhanced by AI recommendations on how to
4:06:23
improve the site's SEO, helping it rank higher in the search results and attract more visitors. So, by now you must be
4:06:31
wondering why it is important to conduct an SEO audit. So, here's why. Conducting
4:06:36
an SEO audit is crucial for improving a website's search engine rankings and overall performance. It helps identify
4:06:43
technical issues such as broken links or poor site structure that can hinder
4:06:49
search engine crawling and indexing. Additionally, an audit enhances user
4:06:54
experience by ensuring the site is mobile friendly, fast, easy to navigate,
4:07:00
which reduces bounce rates and increases conversions. It also ensures content
4:07:05
remains relevant and optimize for target keywords, driving organic traffic
4:07:11
without the need for paid ads. Regular SEO audits help websites stay updated
4:07:17
with algorithm changes and provide insights into how to outperform competitors. Now the most important part
4:07:24
I will let you know the two AI tools to conduct a basic SEO audit for complete
4:07:30
beginners. So let's get into the video. So the first SEO audit website I would
4:07:35
be talking about today is AIO SEO that is all-in-one SEO. It is very easy and
4:07:42
beginner friendly. What you need to do is you have to paste your website URL over here in the search box and then you
4:07:49
have to click on analyze. So let's get started. I'm using today the Shopify's
4:07:54
website to get you an SEO audit. So I will just show you
4:08:00
analyze. It may take a few minutes as it is scanning and see it has provided with
4:08:06
a SEO free SEO report over here. So it will first start with the overall site
4:08:12
score that is how your website is doing overall. It is 82 by 100 is like good
4:08:19
obviously it's excellent. It has commented also and a very good score is between 60 to 80. For best results you
4:08:26
should strive for 70 and above. So 82 it is already good. It has now further
4:08:31
broken down in the uh audit into five critical issues, zero recommendations
4:08:37
and good results. uh the best part is it also shows you the good results and even
4:08:44
the critical issues. So basically it has divided the uh report into 1 2 3 four
4:08:52
types like the basic SEO properties advanced SEO performance and security.
4:08:58
So first get into the first basic SEO. So it it is good. It is good. Like the
4:09:04
uh correct symbols are for those that are working well on your website and the cross red mark is basically you need to
4:09:11
fix this issue. So some images on the page have no alt attribute. So like
4:09:16
there are 51 links you can see you can even see the URLs over here and this is
4:09:23
working good. Moving on to the next advanced SEO. The page is using the uh
Aeo vs SEO
4:09:28
canonical link tag. Uh all this is fine. You don't have to fix over like the
4:09:34
advanced SEO part performance. The server is not using expires headers for the images. And you can click over here
4:09:41
and see basically what is the problem. The page makes 43 request more than 20
4:09:48
requests uh can result in slow page loading. like uh the performance would be less because it makes 43 requests
4:09:56
more than 20 requests can actually hamper the page loading. So it is
4:10:01
necessary you need to focus on this and the size of the HTML document is 73 KB.
4:10:07
You need to also focus over here. So this is over our recommendation of 50 KB. So they will provide you the
4:10:13
recommendations too. And basically this is nice I would say. Moving on to the
4:10:19
security part. Everything looks nice. Uh directly listing seems to be disabled on
4:10:24
the server. That is nice and see it is uh very beginner friendly. And the best
4:10:30
part is you can even download the report from here like you click on download and get the uh like whole report into your
Conduct SEO Audit
4:10:39
own uh device and you can see and make the free changes. So it is very uh
4:10:45
beginner friendly and I would suggest that use it and have a uh for all the beginners I would say use it and it
4:10:52
would like help you to get a free SEO report. The next website I would be talking about is
4:10:57
rankmath.com. It is also an SEO analyzer and this is nothing different. You will
4:11:03
just need to paste your website URL over here and then click on analyze and after
4:11:09
that you will get the free report. Your free SEO audit report is ready. So it is
4:11:15
getting giving you the overall website. It is 82. It is nice. We have seen it
4:11:21
and there are zero warnings and three failed texts. So let's see move on. Uh
4:11:27
common keywords SEO description. So it has given a right symbol that the meta
4:11:32
description was found and it is 145 characters long. So it is has no problem. You don't have to fix anything.
4:11:40
And yeah coming to the image alt attributes as we have seen in the previous um website uh SEO audit that
4:11:48
some images on your homepage have no alt attributes. So yeah, you will need to say this and uh the best part over here
4:11:56
is you know you will be getting some recommendations on how to fix it. So if you click on it basically it will give
4:12:02
you some suggestions that check your images for missing all tags and add useful descriptions to each image. Add
4:12:09
your keywords or synonyms but do it in a natural way. So you basically need to uh
4:12:15
check your images that you are giving it um the all tags and use and using the descriptions for each image that what
4:12:22
that image is about and you have to uh give the um keywords or synonyms of that
4:12:29
uh to make it a better one. So uh this all looks good links ratio SEO title.
4:12:36
Coming to the next advanced SEO search preview is good. Nothing is uh nothing
4:12:42
no problem is there. And scrolling down you will see that it all uh works good.
4:12:50
Performance is also good but yeah we can see one uh cross symbol. Your homepage makes 42 requests. More than 20 requests
4:12:57
can result in a slow page loading. We have found this in the previous audit also. So like it will give you how to
4:13:04
fix. Try to replace embedded objects with HTML 5 alternatives. This HTML uh
4:13:11
new version has some alternatives and you need to replace the embedded objects of that page size. The size of the HTML
4:13:18
document is 71 KB over the average of 33 KB and our recommendation is of 50 KB.
4:13:25
You need to uh like their recommendation is they're recommending you need to do it on 50 KB and you are having 71 KB.
4:13:32
Then let's see how to fix it. uh first remove any unnecessary tags from your markup. Okay, from that HTML you need to
4:13:39
uh like um remove the unnecessary tags. This includes developer comments which are invisible to your users search
4:13:45
engines and uh ignore the text in comments too. Sometimes inline CSS is a culprit. Okay, a little inline CSS can
4:13:52
help your page uh render faster. Too much will bloat the HTML or obviously
4:13:58
their they prefer outline uh CSS and inline CSS is not preferred. You can reduce the CSS repetition with HTML
4:14:05
class and ID attributes. Uh that is fine. Everything you need to change on the HTML CSS that is coding part and
4:14:13
everything else looks fine. You can even share and email and print this SEO audit
4:14:20
and I will say there this is 3 million plus happy users. So it is basically a
4:14:26
very good website for a free uh SEO audit and is very beginner friendly and
4:14:31
I will recommend to use this. So both the free AI tool will help you get a
4:14:37
free SEO audit and make sure you fix your website issues and make your website rank higher. Are you still using
4:14:44
the old YouTube SEO tricks? You might be hurting your YouTube channel without
4:14:49
even knowing it. The YouTube algorithm in 2025 is smarter than ever. Those old
4:14:56
keyword hacks, stuffing your tags or renaming files, not only they are outdated, they could be stopping your
4:15:02
growth. But here's what the good news is. Today, I'll walk you through a stepbystep YouTube SEO system that's
4:15:10
simple to follow, powerful for growth, and actually used by successful creators
4:15:15
every day. We will cover what YouTube SEO really means in 2025. The eight
4:15:20
places to apply SEO in your videos. Five proven strategies for more views and
4:15:26
subscribers. How to use tools like Vid IQ and rapid tags to save hours. And the
4:15:32
outdated tactics you must avoid. If your viewers have been stuck or if you want YouTube algorithm to finally notice your
4:15:39
videos, this is the guide you've been waiting for. So, let's jump right in. First things first, what even is YouTube
4:15:46
SEO? SEO stands for search engine optimization in simple terms. It's how
4:15:51
you help the YouTube algorithm understand, find, and recommend your content to the right audience. It's not
4:15:58
about tricking the system. It's about picking the right keywords, optimizing your title, description, and your
4:16:04
thumbnail, encouraging viewers to click and stay engaged, and using data to improve over time. Without SEO, even the
4:16:11
best videos can get buried under thousands of others. And that's why this matters. Here's where things have been
4:16:18
changed. First of all, YouTube's algorithm today looks at watch time and audience retention. How long people stay
4:16:26
watching. Second of all, it looks into your clickth through rate, your title and thumbnails power to attract the
4:16:33
clicks. It also looks into your viewer engagement, your comments, like and shares, contextual understanding.
4:16:39
YouTube scans your video script, visuals, and even tone. Freshness and consistency. New and active channels get
4:16:47
more love. Notice what's not on the list. Tags, file names, keyword stuffing, those don't really move the
4:16:54
needle anymore. So, if you've been focusing on the wrong things, it's time to update your strategy. Okay? So, now
4:17:00
you know what matters. But where do you actually apply SEO in your videos? Let
4:17:06
me break it down for you. So, now let's discuss the eight key places where you can apply the SEO. So here's exactly
4:17:13
I'll be showing you where you can put your keywords and optimize for further growth. So at first we've got the title.
4:17:19
So here I've been headed down to my YouTube channel here YouTube creator studio mode and you can see the title
4:17:25
name. Suppose this was my video on Firebase Studio. So I've given the title name as fiber studio tutorial explain
4:17:32
simply. All right now I'll just show you a demo. Let's suppose we are searching for a topic on how to make money using
4:17:39
AI agents and see these are the top ranking videos which we get from here.
4:17:44
So you can just have a look at the title name how it made it really engaging, curiositydriven and keyword rich. So you
4:17:51
have to make sure that it interacts well with your audience. It is engaging and
4:17:56
plus it has got some keyword rich words. All right. So you can see the name how they've put the title do this to get
4:18:03
rich with AI agents 15 easy business ideas to get rich and yeah this is my
4:18:08
video here how to make money with AI agents steps to make money with AI agents. So you can see from here what
4:18:14
type of catchy engaging uh title have they included for their video. Now the
4:18:20
next thing we are going to talk about is your thumbnail. So you can see from here you can upload your thumbnail from here.
4:18:26
So one thing is there that if you use short bold text that includes your keyword when it makes sense like for
4:18:34
example if my topic was about the fire studio you see you have to highlight
4:18:39
your keyword which you're targeting for. So if this video was about to make money
4:18:44
then you can see they have included the figures right here and they have all the tools and all. So this makes it really
4:18:51
look interactive and engaging and very catchy. So if somebody is even going through your uh video, they'll just be
4:18:59
stuck looking at your thumbnail out there because it looks really compelling and you can see what type of thumbnails
4:19:05
they have used. Glock three, stripe paid $45 per day. So make sure you really
4:19:10
highlight on all the key factors, key areas where the audience would be looking for. Like suppose it's about
4:19:16
making money then you can just highlight the figures, the numbers. You can see most of them they have done that. They
4:19:23
have just highlighted the numbers right here 10,000 rupees. So it's really good. I mean if anybody is going through the
4:19:29
website they'll be just looking at the numbers because it's catchy, right? So now there's the next thing I'm going to
4:19:35
talk about is your file name. So let's suppose when you're saving your video, make sure you save it using your main
4:19:42
keyword name. If your video is about Firebase Studio, so when you're just saving it, I'll just show you here. So
4:19:48
let's suppose this is my video. So when I'm just saving it, I'll just give a right click. So I'll just do a right
4:19:54
click from here. And when I just go on the property section from here, you see the name has been mentioned, right?
4:20:00
Firebase tutorial final. And you can just simply you know give your name
4:20:06
whatever name you want to give the keyword richd driven word. So it doesn't even affect that much. It's not a big
4:20:12
ranking factor anymore but then it will surely help you with your workflow and yeah it slightly supports a bit of SEO
4:20:19
as well. Now let's talk about another important feature which is the description. So make sure to write
4:20:25
natural helpful text that includes your keywords three to five times without
4:20:31
stuffing. For example, in this video I'll show you how to grow your shorts. So you can see in the description I've
4:20:38
mentioned that you will be seeing the YouTube Firebase Studio and make sure multiple times you can just mention
4:20:45
whatever tools are you listing lovable bolt or how many times are you making
4:20:50
your keyword appear in your description. So for this you can use tools like Vid IQ and rapid tags. I'll just show you
4:20:57
later in the video the demos thing. And then we've got this uh hashtag section down here. Yeah. So you can see from
4:21:04
here the tags in the hashtag section. So make sure you use two three to eight hashtags with your most important ones
4:21:12
first which is the Firebase Studio. I mean the video the topic which you're working on. I would say they matter a
4:21:18
little bit because they can help you with misspellings and variations. So for this you can actually use rapid tags to
4:21:25
generate optimized tags within seconds. So I'll just head over to my Google and search for rapid tags from here. You can
4:21:33
see grow quicker on YouTube. So just click on this. So you can actually use this particular tool to grow quicker on
4:21:41
YouTube. It will actually generate hashtags and tags generator for you automatically. So while I click on use
4:21:48
tag generator. So let's suppose my topic name is AI agents. All right, I'll just
4:21:56
click on the search thing. Yeah, so it has automatically generated tags for me. As you can see, AI agents use cases. So
4:22:03
it's pretty cool, right? You don't have to actually search on YouTube manually. It gives you automated tag generator
4:22:09
related to your keyword. But then I would say doing manually also affects a
4:22:14
bit because you just can't simply rely on AI tool as well. Now, another thing
4:22:19
I'm going to talk about is the subtitles and captions. So, remember, speak your keywords naturally during the video.
4:22:26
Then, review YouTube's auto captions to make sure they are accurate. So, you can see the caption thing which appears on
4:22:33
the screen right here. So, while you review your video, make sure to just check if it's actually correct spelled
4:22:39
or not. Then, we've got this chapters timestamp thing in your video. So, if your video is about educational, you can
4:22:45
add chapters using keywords. So you can see I've already added my timestamps from here. So now when I just head over
4:22:52
to this particular video from here when I just view on YouTube the automated
4:22:58
chapters will be coming there. Right. This is the caption thing I have. Yeah. So I'll just click on this.
4:23:05
You also have this feature of summarizing your video through this. So while you just click on this summarize
4:23:10
video thing, it will head over to the chart GPT and it will give you to actually summarize your whole particular
4:23:16
video. I mean, you don't even have to uh copy the link or do anything. It will give you an automated timestamps and the
4:23:23
chapters of your video generated. So, now that you know where to use your SEO, let's talk about how to use it smartly
4:23:30
so your channel actually grows. So, first let's talk about number one tool, which is the Vid IQ. And it is actually
4:23:36
a timesaver. I'll show you how. So, while I just click on this link from here, you can see. Yeah. So it will let
4:23:45
you find all the trending keywords. You can get video ideas, find the trending videos. You can also generate video
4:23:51
content using this thing. You can also search for a particular keyword like let's suppose it's 30 minute workout.
4:23:58
And if I just head over to this, you can actually search the ranking and the
4:24:03
search volume which is high and the competition is also very high. So make sure you target such keywords where you
4:24:11
have less competition but then the search volume would be really high. Now for this particular keyword you you'll
4:24:17
get the search volume as well. Plus you will also get the matching keywords which you can use with their search
4:24:23
volumes and you can see uh the search volume is this is low which is why 30 minute workout and all. And you can also
4:24:30
get the top trending videos for the particular keyword which you're looking for. You also have this option of
4:24:36
thumbnails. So you can just describe your thumbnails idea and it can actually generate your first free thumbnail for
4:24:42
you. You can also generate titles description using this particular tool
4:24:48
if you want regarding your topic and then we have this option of optimizing as well. So we'll just install this
4:24:55
extension from here and I'll show you how it works. So now I have installed the particular extension from here. So
4:25:00
I'll just search for a keyword like let's suppose it's yoga for beginners and you'll just see from here. So it
4:25:08
will search the term for you and you also have this option of enable inline keywords. It is not that necessary but
4:25:14
then if you want you can do that. So it will give you an overall score of this particular topic. Uh so the volume as
4:25:21
you can see it is 81 and the competition is very high and it has rated 52 out of
4:25:27
100. So these are the search term and the average view, average subscribers.
4:25:32
It will give you a whole list of the particular topic you need. I mean the whole particular SEO using this tool.
4:25:39
And then we have uh the related opportunities as well and the top channels plus for this term. So if you
4:25:46
want to just simply go to their channels and check their website, you can also do that. It has also given the top related
4:25:51
opportunities as well. Now this was a short tail keyword right now. If I search for yoga for beginners under
4:26:00
30, maybe yoga for beginners under 1 hour. Okay. Or maybe yoga for beginners
4:26:07
under 30 minutes. See, yoga for beginners 30 minute full body workout. So this is a
4:26:14
long-term keyword out here. So we'll just check the search volume from here. Yeah. So for this particular topic, you
4:26:20
can see the overall score is low. The volume is 54 out here. and the
4:26:25
competition is very high. So it would not be actually worth making on this particular topic or the keyword which
4:26:32
you choose. Now let's talk about a second uh tool on our list which is Tube Buddy. I'll just search for this
4:26:39
Tubeuddy extension and you can see you can this is also a SEO tool just like
4:26:44
Vid IQ for growing your YouTube channel. So you can grow your channel confidently
4:26:50
using the tools and so it will help you know what content you create in order to
4:26:55
grow your channel just like VQ I said it will also help you manage grow your channel and all of these option so you
4:27:01
can just simply install this extension from here and I'll show you again how it works. So let's suppose I was searching
4:27:08
for the similar topic AI agents for beginners. All right. And I
4:27:14
have both my extensions installed with IQ plus the Cube Buddy from
4:27:22
here. Yeah. So you can see the Tubeuddy search explorer. So it will show you the
4:27:27
keyword score and your keyword stats as well. So I'll just click on this show
4:27:33
keyword score. Yeah. So it said that the search volume is good. The competition
4:27:38
is also good and the overall search volume is also very good which is 72 out of 100. And you can also get the related
4:27:45
searches from here. How to build AI gems for beginners, AI for beginners, Microsoft. So these were the top
4:27:51
searched topics. You'll also get the common video tags for this particular topic if you want. So now if we compare
4:27:58
it to Vid IQ, you can see Vid IQ has also given me an overall score of medium
4:28:03
which is 56 out of 100. and the competition is low, the volume is
4:28:08
medium. But here it says the search volume is good and the competition is also good. So basically, Tubeuddy's SEO
4:28:16
studio will walk you through exactly where to add keywords so that you never miss an opportunity. So if I had to
4:28:23
compare both the particular tools from here, I really like the Vid IQ more because it gives you a lot of options as
4:28:30
you can see from here. Yeah. So it gives a lot of options of generating your thumbnails, your content, your keyword
4:28:36
ideas and many thing. But then on the same hand, Tubeuddy will also give you the overall stats of the video which you
4:28:42
want. So you can see it will give you the overall stats of the video, the SEO, the social channel name, the best
4:28:48
practices and all the tags which you want. So overall, if I would had to rate, I think both of them are really
4:28:54
cool. So you can just try using both the tools if you would want. So now let's discuss some of the winning SEO
4:29:00
strategies for 2025. So now that you have a good idea about the basics, let's
4:29:05
go deeper. So here's what smart creators actually do. They research before recording. Never shoot a video without
4:29:13
knowing if the people are searching for it. So while you get any particular keyword, make sure you have done a
4:29:19
thorough research of that particular topic and you have the stats maintained of the search volume. Yeah. So if you
4:29:26
want the keyword statistics again you can use this free tool from Google which
4:29:31
is the Google trends and you can just head over to this explore section from here and then again you can just give
4:29:37
add a search term and then you'll be getting the whole stats of the particular keywords. I mean is it a
4:29:42
really uh trending keyword with a good volume or should you consider using it or not. So if it has got low search
4:29:49
volume then definitely it is not worth it. But yeah, if it has got a good search volume with good SEO, you can use
4:29:55
it. So this will basically give you the Google search volume. And for YouTube, you could use tools like Tubeuddy and
4:30:02
Vid IQ. Now the second thing is using the YouTube autocomplete feature. So you can type your topic and see what phrases
4:30:09
autocomplete will suggest for you. Now these are basically real searches happening right now. Then you've got the
4:30:15
answer viewer questions. You can find common questions in the Vid IQ's question tool or Google's people ask
4:30:22
search question and then you can just have a look of all the keywords which are trending. Then you can have the
4:30:27
longtail keyword. Make sure you use longer specific phrases like how to start a podcast for beginners in 2025
4:30:35
instead of just searching for podcast. Then you have to do a competitor analysis content just not studying their
4:30:42
competitor content but also their tags as well. So while I search for any topics which was
4:30:49
notebook LM right so you can see we have got this is the autocomplete feature which will give you a lot of options
4:30:56
from here notebook LM Hindi notebook LM podcast tutorial in Hindi so while I
4:31:01
search for uh tutorial in Hindi you can see these are the top ranking videos which we get and just look over to their
4:31:08
title name free AI tool and their you know thumbnail as well so they have
4:31:14
really used a catchy thumbnail plus their u title also looks good. Now when you just click on this
4:31:20
video so you can just have a look of what they have mentioned in their description and meanwhile you can also
4:31:29
create content that includes all the particular contents and what hashtags they have included and what tags they
4:31:35
have included. So make sure while you create content on similar topics you also have everything mentioned what is
4:31:42
already covered in these videos as well. Now there are some outdated tactics which you should avoid. First of all, it
4:31:49
is over relying on tags. Keyword stuffing in titles or description. This
4:31:54
thing actually doesn't work out. The next thing is renaming files for SEO purposes only which also doesn't work
4:32:01
out. Then is the copying competitive tags. Now you can have a good look of the tags mentioned there but just do not
4:32:08
directly copy paste because it will not help you to reach your SEO properly. The
4:32:13
next thing is buying fake likes, views or comments. But this thing can even get banned because it is of no use. Now
4:32:20
YouTube's AI now detects natural language engagement and viewer retention. So you can't just trick the
4:32:26
system anymore. You have to work on it. Now, now let's talk about the ranking factors checklist which I have made
4:32:32
here. So here's what actually matters this year. Watch time and audience
4:32:38
retention. First is the watch time and audience retention. So make sure your video actually has got some good
4:32:46
audience retention and in order to do that you can create engaging questions I
4:32:51
mean engaging video content so that your watch time is really good and it's really high. Second is the clickth
4:32:57
through rate which you can get it using you know creating some catchy thumbnails or using really good engaging titles for
4:33:05
your video. Then we've got the viewer engagement like comment and share. So it really matters how many people are
4:33:11
liking it, commenting and sharing also saving your video. Next we've got the natural keyword. So I told you before
4:33:18
you can use titles, descriptions, spoken words. So try to use natural engaging
4:33:23
English only. Next we've got the suggested video performance. Then we have personalization and session watch
4:33:29
time. The next was using the smart tools like SEO tools which was Vid IQ, rapid tags and Tubeuddy as well. Answering
4:33:37
real audience questions. So it's really important if you how you're interacting. So if you've got any question make sure
4:33:43
you answer that in the comment section. Plus the next thing is if you've given any topic make sure you answer the real
4:33:52
questions like the application used some real life examples. So which would actually be related to your audiences
4:33:59
and they would feel like watching it which will help you to maintain your watch time and your audience retention.
4:34:05
So you see how everything is linked to each other. So while you're preparing for a topic, you have to actually make a
4:34:11
checklist that how are you creating the content. So first you can just start with creating a story line with having
4:34:18
some good engaging hook using some best examples and then make sure you include
4:34:24
some quiz questions in between so that people would like to stay till the end of your video. Last thing which I would
4:34:31
say was avoiding the outdated tactics. So which I already told you before do not just copy paste your competitor's
4:34:38
content or their tags or anything. So that will not lead to good views obviously. Onpage optimization as the
4:34:46
name suggests is the practice of optimizing web pages to rank higher and
4:34:51
get relevant traffic from the search engine. Onpage optimization includes
4:34:57
both content and HTML source code optimization. Search engine optimization
4:35:03
can be very complex. So when you're trying to understand it for the first time, I find it very easy just to break
4:35:09
it up into general concepts that you might already have an understanding of. When you look at the hundreds of signals
4:35:15
that go into SEO, they can be broken up into either relevancy or because
4:35:20
sometimes it's both, popularity. So relevancy and popularity. Out of all
4:35:25
these signals, they fit into one of these two things. We're going to break all the signals we have into these two
4:35:31
areas. In this section, we're going to talk about the onpage factors. That's because these are the factors that you
4:35:38
have direct impact upon and you can make a small tweak and have a big impact with
4:35:43
organic traffic with your onpage relevancy factors. The primary onpage
4:35:49
relevancy factors that I'll cover in this lesson are title tags and metadescriptions, header tags, which are
4:35:56
used for headlines and subheadings, website URLs and URL structure, image
4:36:02
alt text, internal links, keyword usage, and site maps. Let's start with one of
4:36:08
my favorites and that is the title tag. This is also called a page title. The
4:36:14
page title is not shown on the page. No rather it is displayed on the browser
4:36:19
tab. And this is what makes it highly important is that in addition to being displayed on the browser tab, it is also
4:36:26
the title tag or the page title that is shown on the text in the Google search
4:36:32
results as the link to the page. The page title influences both the click-through rates and people's first
4:36:39
impressions of our website. Next up, we have the metad description.
4:36:44
Now, the metad description can be a bit confusing. The metad description is in the code and it does not influence
4:36:52
rankings, but it does influence clicks. People will see your snippet or
4:37:00
your page information in the search engine results. That gray text is the
4:37:06
metad description. If you don't have a metad description, then it may pull information from the
4:37:13
page. You can affect this and improve the chances of your metadescription
4:37:18
appearing if you write a short descriptive phrase of the content or the purpose of the page. And just because we edit these
4:37:25
elements does not guarantee that they will show up. I often say that we affect the change, but we cannot control it.
4:37:33
This is because the search engine may override your changes and show different content in these areas. Sometimes it may
4:37:40
help and it might be a better description, but many times it's
4:37:46
not. Now, let's go to the next element, the header tags. These are also referred
4:37:51
to as the heading and subheading. And this is how HTML was built when the web was first created. It
4:37:59
enables a logical hierarchy of content. So starting with the headline, then
4:38:06
displaying a subheading and then subheadings after that. The idea here is
4:38:11
that you're establishing a hierarchy of information. So you start with the H1.
4:38:18
Like a newspaper, there's only one main headline per page. It describes the main
4:38:24
purpose of the page. Then a subheading, the H2. This is how you break the
4:38:30
subcontent into subcategories. Obviously, you'll want to use a keyword in there as well. You see,
4:38:37
by describing the purpose of the page in the headline and then again in a subheading, you're naturally going to
4:38:44
use your primary and secondary keywords because you're going to associate them
4:38:50
with the product or the purpose and the benefit. The key is to keep it short.
4:38:56
You see, after the headline are the subcategories, the H2s, and then your H3
4:39:01
is typically used as a paragraph heading. Now, putting the keyword in these headings alone does not make your
4:39:08
page optimized. Remember, the purpose is to provide a quick reference for people
4:39:13
to find the content they need within seconds. So short explanatory heading
4:39:19
and subheadings, paragraph headings are very effective and naturally you'll be
4:39:26
using keywords to help people locate the information that is most important to them. Now if we go back to the search
4:39:33
engine results page, the SER, there is another element in that listing. The page title is the large blue text. The
4:39:40
metad description is the gray text. Now the green text is the URL of the page that is listed. This is the address of
4:39:47
the page. Just like the address for your home, the internet knows that the URL is
4:39:52
the address for that page. This is extremely important for SEO for a variety of reasons. The most important
4:39:59
though is your keyword usage. I like to make sure that I have at least one relevant word in the URL. Now, also
4:40:08
here, keep it short. One of the worst things you can do is have a URL full of keywords or even worse hyphenate them
4:40:15
all. You remember people use these URLs. They provide context for the page.
4:40:21
People also copy and paste URLs into mobile messages, emails, and social links. So, it is extremely important to
4:40:29
keep these short, succinct, and I like to say readable. Now, I've just briefly
4:40:35
touched about the importance of the URL. And now let's look at the URL structure. First, let's start with the
4:40:43
primary core of the URL, the domain name. In the example, with the URL I
4:40:48
have here, example.com. That's the domain name. So, this is the first thing that people see
4:40:54
with your online business. Now, beyond the internet, this is going to be what's
4:41:00
in all of your ads, emails, brochures, business cards, and online, your social
4:41:05
profiles, all of your marketing efforts are going to drive people to this domain. There's a lot of advice about
4:41:11
buying or using domains that have your keywords in them. And unfortunately, domains have been sold for decades, so
YouTube SEO Optimization
4:41:18
there's less chance of finding a domain with the keywords you want. Now, the search engines don't make the keyword
4:41:25
used in the domain a primary ranking signal. So, that's good. However, the domain is your business. It needs to be
4:41:31
memorable. If you have a very, I call it a spammy looking domain name with
4:41:36
multiple words and hyphens or one that's hard to spell or confusing, people are
4:41:42
going to make an initial impression off of that. So, make sure you have something that's going to make a great
4:41:47
first impression. Here's the rule for a domain name. something that's easy to spell and easy to pronounce. Ideally,
4:41:54
sure, it's something you can type and share, something you're going to be able to put on a business card and be proud
4:42:00
of, not something that you bought primarily because you want it for SEO
4:42:05
reasons, and you think with that you're going to succeed. As an example, just think about Amazon. Their domain name
4:42:11
says nothing about books, and yet it grew to be one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world. The same with
4:42:17
Alibaba or Google. Their domain names were not the keyword but their marketing
4:42:22
and branding built their company. Now everything after the domain is a subdirectory. This is based on your
4:42:29
website organization. As an example, if you have a website selling shoes, then
4:42:34
the subdirectory can be called shoes. It's easy, right? The subdirectory is the folder that contains the relevant
4:42:40
files or pages for that group. Think of a file folder with documents inside. The
4:42:45
file folder is usually based on a major category of content or products. Now, inside the folder are individual
4:42:52
documents or pages. These files or pages usually come after the subdirectory. In
4:42:58
this example, you see the file.html. The next step in optimizing the URL is to name the page in a way
4:43:04
that explains the content of the page. To use our e-commerce shoe website, a
4:43:09
page name would usually be a specific product name. This way you would end up with domain name slash shoes as the
4:43:17
category slashbrandame running shoe. Insert that here. If you've ever looked
4:43:23
at the HTML that make up the instructions of the page, you'll understand a bit more of how search
4:43:29
engines get the information from the page. The text on the page in the markup such as the headings provide
4:43:35
instructions as to where the text is located, the importance and prominence of the text in addition to the
4:43:42
arrangement of the overall page. HTML is a set of instructions for a browser to
4:43:47
assemble the page and the search engines use that as well. Now the search engines spiders cannot see images. As the
4:43:55
internet developed, many attributes were added to provide for accessibility and additional features. Users that are site
4:44:02
impaired cannot see images. And the alternative text tag
4:44:08
describes the image. Further, there are many times when our bandwidth isn't
4:44:13
strong and not all of the images will load. In that case, we need the alt text
4:44:19
description to provide the context of the image and its purpose. Search engines use this alt text description to
4:44:26
gain additional context about the page, the content of the image, and its purpose. Now, we have an entire section
4:44:33
on links, but at this point, I just want to cover internal links. An internal
4:44:38
link is a link from one page on your website to another page of your own website. Now, this is important from a
4:44:45
relevancy perspective. You'll see internal links in your main navigation.
4:44:52
You'll likely have a link that says home, one that says contact us or about
4:44:57
our company. What you're showing to search engines and to humans is that this section, if you click on this link,
4:45:04
is about our company or this is where you find our contact information. You see, these links are
4:45:11
not votes like external links. However, they provide relevance and context to
4:45:17
the information on your own website. Let's dive in a little more on
4:45:23
keywords. When a search engine crawls and processes your website, it doesn't simply look for the instances of
4:45:30
specific keywords. It's a lot more complex than that. It's using a technology called natural language
4:45:39
processing. Natural language processing uses algorithms to try to understand the
4:45:44
meaning of text. You see, search engine processing is attempting to be human.
4:45:50
This is the same way that people see and hear the words, and we're using the words to find the meaning expressed in
4:45:57
the words. Similarly, when a search engine goes to your website, it may seek
4:46:02
keywords, but it's looking for the context of those words. You may say football, but just having the word
4:46:08
football repeated throughout your website isn't going to help you rank specifically for football. what you need
4:46:14
to do and what is more common in actual human conversation happens very
4:46:20
naturally when we talk about football we use naturally additional words such as
4:46:25
goal and referee and world cup you see Google and the other search engines are
4:46:30
going to take these into account by usage of other synonyms and other common words you present the context of a
4:46:38
bigger broader idea for your website the next site signal that we have is site
4:46:43
maps. Now there are two kinds of site maps. There's the site map that is for
4:46:48
humans and there is the site map that are for search engine robots, crawlers
4:46:54
or spiders. The one that is for human is called an HTML sitemap. You've probably
4:47:00
seen these before. The link is generally in the footer of a website. If you click on it, it shows you the major sections
4:47:07
of the website, provides some search functionality, but looking at it as a
4:47:13
human, it shows you the hierarchy of the website and where to find important information. It shows how everything
4:47:20
fits together. Now, there's something else that exists called an XML sitemap. It's
4:47:26
not linked from any page of your website, but exists as an independent file on your server. Now this is
4:47:34
something you can see but it is formatted for search engine spiders using a programming language
4:47:41
called XML. It shows the hierarchy and the priority of each of the URLs of the
4:47:46
website. Every page, every document, every image and it also shows the date
4:47:52
that each page was last updated or changed. So, at this point, we've covered a lot
4:47:58
of things that are important and things that you should be doing when optimizing your onpage content. Now, let's go a
4:48:05
different direction and cover things that you should not be doing. Keyword stuffing, hidden text, repetitive anchor
4:48:12
text, and cloaking. The first one is keyword stuffing. Now, back in the early days of search engine optimization,
4:48:19
people used to increase the instances of words on the page. Now, this is well
4:48:24
before natural language processing. At that time, search engines were looking for occurrences of specific words. Well,
4:48:32
search engines, they're very smart about this. What may have worked 20 years ago or 10 years ago, keyword stuffing does
4:48:39
not work. You're not going to rank better for any given phrase by including it a dozen or more times on the page. In
4:48:47
fact, you might get an over optimization penalty by constantly repeating the same
4:48:53
word over and over. Focus on writing content that engages with your visitors and uses language naturally. Now, the
4:49:01
next one is hidden text. Unfortunately, I still see this. This is when you write content that is solely for search
4:49:07
engines and not for people. Now, typically it is attempted by writing a
4:49:13
lot of repetitive keywords as text, coloring it white and placing it against
4:49:18
a white background. You see, this was developed as another way to add more keyword stuffed text without the user
4:49:25
seeing the overuse of keywords. Now, it didn't work too well in the past and it definitely does not work today. This
4:49:31
tactic backfires in two ways. First, search engines can tell when it's white
4:49:37
text on a white background. It's easy to tell from a computer science point of view. Search engines read the HTML and
4:49:44
in the HTML are the instructions for colors. When you hide text, modern
4:49:50
search engines are smart enough to figure it out, probably better than a human. Now, secondly, it's done to hide
4:49:56
repetitive keyword stuff text, which is the second thing against you. These outdated, unprofessional tactics will
4:50:03
most likely get a website penalized by the search engines. The next one is repetitive anchor text. You may have
4:50:11
followed a link to a page when looking for a business or information and instead of the information you want, you
4:50:17
get a page that doesn't feel like it was written for people. Every sentence is redundant, repetitive, and almost every
4:50:24
keyword is linked even when there doesn't need to be a link. It confuses the flow of the information on the page.
4:50:31
Now again, this used to be a tactic that sometimes would work, but it's no longer
4:50:37
helpful. Search engines and their natural language processing algorithms have advanced significantly. They can
4:50:44
tell when something's not readable. When something is probably intended for machines and rankings, but not for
4:50:49
people, search engines will figure it out. Please don't waste time on redundant links trying to inflate the
4:50:55
relevance of your links and pages. The last thing to cover here is cloaking.
4:51:01
Cloaking is the idea of showing one thing to the search engines and something entirely different to humans.
4:51:07
Now, this is related to the rest of the tactics I just covered. It's something that used to work, but it was expressly
4:51:14
against the search engine guidelines. While it may have worked if the search engines discovered it on your website,
4:51:20
you could have been penalized or dropped from the search engine results entirely. Now we've covered all of the most
4:51:26
important onpage optimization factors. Let's take a look at what the theoretically perfectly optimized page
4:51:33
would look like. In this example, we can see many of these elements being used together. You can also see that the base
4:51:39
keyphrase digital camera is being repeated but always included with a
4:51:45
specific context. First at the top of the page is the URL which has digital
4:51:50
cameras in the address. The page title follows using the context of the information and adding the word reviews.
4:51:57
You can also see at the top of the page that the main navigation and secondary navigation, also called the breadcrumb
4:52:04
navigation, provides context of the pages location within the entire website
4:52:10
and natural keyword usage. The H1 headline is the keyphrase,
4:52:15
but also happens to simply be the best title for the content of the page. The subsequent subheadings provide
4:52:22
additional information such as ratings, recommendations, and features. The links
4:52:29
provide relevant ways to access additional content. The image utilizes
4:52:34
alt text. There are also clear calls to action which provide relevant offers to
4:52:39
visitors. As you can see, the context of all of the content is very strong and sends a
4:52:45
clear relevancy signal to both search engines and readers. To conclude this section, I'd
4:52:52
like to cover the top influencing factors. Now, sometimes you may find these as lists, but I found it a bit
4:53:00
more practical to separate them into categories. Typically every year you'll find these
4:53:05
collections of lists from surveys, experts or speculation. Some are from
4:53:11
testing, but honestly you can't ever truly test a search engine as they change a little bit with every
4:53:18
algorithm. So the best thing is to take from these lists these factors that are
4:53:23
the tried and trueue factors over the years that have worked consistently. also those tactics that
4:53:30
not only make your website more effective with users, they tend to do well with search engines. So, if a
4:53:36
tactic serves that dual purpose, it's a good tactic. So, these are not exclusive
4:53:42
and have to lists for every situation, but guides and indicators for you to
4:53:48
use. The top onpage factors from surveys, opinions, and data are these. a
4:53:55
relevant page title, page headings, anchor text links, a keyword-based URL,
4:54:02
a keyword or contextual file name such as page name, image name, or PDF file
4:54:08
name, alt text and images, and finally, what you do with the content on a page
4:54:14
to make it more readable. Lists, bullet points, and bolded text. The top factors
4:54:20
for off-page linking tend to contain these items. The total number of domains linking to
4:54:27
you, the number of highly influential domains linking to you, the number of
4:54:33
unique domain IP addresses, the total backlinks without no follow
4:54:39
limits, the total relevant anchor text in links to you, and finally the types
4:54:46
and context of keywords in anchor text links. The domain also contributes
4:54:53
factors to your overall rankings such as the age of the domain which would include ownership information such as
4:55:00
the length of time owned and operated by a company. The real business information
4:55:06
tied to that domain such as the business address being the same as the business registration address for the domain. In
4:55:14
addition, the signals from social accounts driving visits to the
4:55:19
domain. Functionally, the search engines also utilize some attribution based on
4:55:25
the quality of programming of the website. For instance, taking care of
4:55:31
the basic search engine protocols of the robots.ext file, XML sitemap, and HTTPS
4:55:39
protocol. Websites that implement these features have shown that they are familiar with search engine guidelines
4:55:45
and protocol. Now, one of the changes over the past few years has been the
4:55:51
implementation of page speed as an increasing ranking factor. Slow loading
4:55:57
pages with a lot of extraneous code that slow the delivery of the page will be
4:56:02
penalized as they take away from the user experience. Optimizing the page code, speeding up
4:56:09
the load time of the page can directly impact your rankings and this is closely
4:56:14
related to the mobile friendliness of your website. If your website is not mobile friendly, it will be limited in
4:56:21
visibility as Google's primary index is focused on mobile devices and mobile
4:56:27
delivery. Behavioral factors are the newest factors and with the advent of
4:56:32
artificial intelligence, it is making determining the intent and is making
4:56:37
determining easier for a search engine to derive a judgment of relevancy based
4:56:43
on interaction. While the extent of these signals is not fully known, it is
4:56:48
suspected that they are minor but growing in importance. These include the
4:56:54
amount of users that search for a brand name, business's name, and go to that
4:56:59
result showing brand awareness. Also, the amount of direct visits bypassing
4:57:05
search, time on page, pages per session, which is also called the depth of visit.
4:57:11
And lastly, the behavior of a searcher from the results page. How many results
4:57:17
are clicked? How many times do they return to the results? This evaluation is looking to judge if the results
4:57:24
presented were satisfactory or deficient for that
4:57:29
query. The two broad categories of ranking signals are popularity and relevance. Of the onpage factors, the
4:57:36
page title is the most important individual field. The URL is important and should be memorable. Alt text is
4:57:44
important for search engines as well as for site impaired humans. Avoid keyword
4:57:51
stuffing, hidden text, repetitive anchor text, and cloaking. Natural language
4:57:56
processing is a technology that aims to understand the intent that humans have
4:58:01
when searching for information. Did you know that 93% of online experiences begin with a search engine? That's a
4:58:08
massive audience you are missing out on if your website isn't ranking high on search result pages, that is SERPS.
4:58:16

5:01:02
the whole interface has changed. There are lot of things over here. Let me explain to you guys what all these
5:01:08
things are. All right. So there are various options under public and on from
5:01:14
which you can filter prompts by uh topic as you can see or
5:01:20
activity and then uh prompts can be sorted by top videos trending as you can
5:01:26
see. And uh there are actually 4892 prompts available. And uh you can see the first
5:01:34
12 on this page you can see. And some examples of prompts uh
5:01:39
here is like you can say used SEO optimized content writer human written 100% unique SEO optimized article. So
5:01:46
these are the examples of prompt. Now first of all we'll ask Chad GBT to write
5:01:51
a blog post for us on let's say fitness. All right. So we'll ask J
5:02:02
GBD fitness in everyday
5:02:08
lifestyle. All right. Uh let's click on this. So we haven't used any prompt till
5:02:15
yet. So let's just first put this input and let's see what JGBT gives
5:02:23
us. All right. So as you can see this is the topic name
5:02:29
importance of everyday fitness simple strategies to incorporate fitness and we can see subtopics are also
5:02:36
there. All right and here's the conclusion. All right so this is basically our blog
5:02:44
post. So now let's say we want to optimize this blog post and we want to
5:02:50
do SEO on this one. So let's first just copy this. We'll copy this and paste in
5:02:59
our document. All right. So this is our document and we have pasted this. All
5:03:07
right. Now let's go back over here and let's say we want to write it in a more
5:03:13
familiar or you can say friendly tone and in a more explanatory tone you can
5:03:18
also use. So let's just write
5:03:29
this. Don't worry about the spelling guys. Uh chat pretty take care of this.
5:03:34
All right. So let's see what are the changes in both of these blog
5:03:42
post. Let's just wait to finish it. And here's the conclusion. So this
5:03:49
is the second blog post. So let's understand the difference uh in between these two. First we'll first check out
5:03:57
for this one. Start small. Begin with manageable changes. All right. As you can see here it is begin
5:04:04
with manageable changes. Take the stairs instead of elevator. Walk or bike to
5:04:10
nearby destinations or stand and stretch during work breaks. These small efforts
5:04:16
can add up over time. All right, let's just see what is written over here in the second blog post. In the second blog
5:04:23
post, it is written, begin with manageable changes that fit seamlessly into your daily routine. For example, or
5:04:29
for instance, choose to take the stairs instead of elevator, walk or bike to
On Page SEO
5:04:35
nearby destination instead of driving or stand and stretch during work breaks.
5:04:40
These small efforts can accumulate over time and contribute to your overall fitness. So if you want to take the
5:04:47
second one which is a few changes it is more bit explanatory uh compared to the
5:04:52
first one we can just copy this this one as well. So you can uh write a second
5:04:57
prompt as well in which if you want to write in a friendly tone or in a formal
5:05:02
tone you can write like that all you have to do is to just write the prompt in chat GPT. Let's just copy paste it
5:05:10
and replace it with the first with the second one. All right. So now we are back in chat
5:05:17
GBT. So now basically we have the blog post content. Basically we have the content of it. Now we want to polish it.
5:05:23
We want to select the best title out of it and many more things. So for that
5:05:29
let's just make use of prompts. Instead of writing all these prompts by
5:05:34
yourself, you can make use of the prompts that is that comes with AIPM chatg prompts. All right. So let's just
5:05:42
say we want to write about the title. We want to select a perfect title for this blog post. So what we can do is we'll go
5:05:49
over here and first of all we'll select in topics we'll go and we'll select
5:05:54
copyrightiting because we want to write about the SEO optimized title. We want the best title. We'll select
5:06:02
copyrightiting. Confirm. All right. Now after this you
5:06:08
can just go for prompts what whichever you
5:06:14
like. I'm going to go for this one blog post title generator. As you can see also if you didn't get what you wanted
5:06:22
then you can go for the search engine over here. You can just type let's just say if you want to uh want to if you're
5:06:29
writing a script basically and you want a perfect title for it then you can write a script generator or something
5:06:34
like that over here automatically whichever prompt that are relevant to it will come. All right. So uh we have
5:06:41
selected this one blog post title generator because we have to create a title for our blog post. We click on
5:06:46
this and now all we have to do is to write the name of our blog post. The
5:06:52
name of our blog post is we'll select everyday lifestyle fitness in everyday
5:06:58
lifestyle. Let's just select this one. All right. Now, as you can see, you
5:07:05
can select the titles to write it is five. Let's just select 10. All right.
5:07:10
Now, the language you can select English and many more languages are there. We'll
5:07:16
keep it in English itself. Tone, emotional or default. Let's just be default itself. Poetic default default
5:07:24
itself we'll keep it like this. All right. Now click on this. Let's just
5:07:31
see. So according to chat GB APRM prompt these are the 10 best titles that we can
5:07:38
implement in our blog post. Now what we want to do is select one best title out
5:07:44
of it. All right. So these are 10. We have to select one out of it. So for that we'll go to Google keyword
5:07:54
planner. So this is Google keyword planner. We'll click on this find your campaign keywords. We'll click on this
5:08:02
visit keyword planner. Now you guys might be thinking what is Google keyword planner. So let me explain to you
5:08:09
guys. So this Google keyword planner is a free tool that helps you find keywords for your online content. It shows you
5:08:16
how often people search for certain words and phrases and how much competition there is to rank for those
5:08:23
keywords. This way you can choose the best keywords to target in your ads or
5:08:29
blog post or website to attract more visitors and potential customers. So it'll give you the numbers basically
5:08:35
which are mostly ranking and having the competition. All right. So, we'll click
5:08:41
on discover new keywords and let's select where it is.
5:08:47
We'll select the first 10. Go to Google keyword planner. And
5:08:54
now here we will paste it. So all 10 of them are pasted. Now
5:08:59
what we'll do is we'll click on get results. So after clicking on get results as you can
5:09:06
see. So this is average monthly searches. This is competition. The we
5:09:11
want the maximum monthly searches fitness, healthy lifestyle and low in
5:09:17
competition. So according to your preference you can select from here and whichsoever this is 100k to 1 million
5:09:25
and many more topics you can select from here which has low competition. As you can see this treadmill has more uh
5:09:33
average view 100k to 1 million but the competition is also high. So we should keep the competition low as well. So we
5:09:40
should keep in mind. So we can select our best title from it. So whichever
5:09:45
suits. All right. After selecting the best title, we can go
5:09:50
to our what we call this blog post to change the title. So this is the new
5:09:58
title. Let's keep it like this. All right. So now our title is
5:10:05
done. Now let's go back to chat GPT and here is a chat
5:10:12
GPT and now let's go to the its layout. Now here we want to
5:10:19
write the content regarding that regarding that title. So what we'll do is basically we'll go over here and
5:10:26
we'll select SEO and once we have selected it we'll go we'll select this prompt human
5:10:33
written 100% used SEO optimized article. Now based on that title that we have generated we'll write a complete content
5:10:40
on it. We'll use the help of this prompt. So as you can see G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G GT3 3.5 Turbo
5:10:46
GPT4 GPT4O. We'll select this and paste our title. This is our
5:10:55
title. Transform your life. How everyday fitness can boost your health. So now this prompt will generate the content
5:11:02
based on this title. All right. Now let's see as you can see transform your life
5:11:09
how everyday fitness can boost your health. This is the content outline the article outline you can say.
Off Page SEO
5:11:23
So this is the introduction. What is everyday fitness? Then physical fitness
5:11:29
benefits and it keeps on writing. I believe it is it will be a
5:11:34
long article or
5:11:42
blog. So you don't have to write too many prompts for this. You can just do
5:11:47
this and the whole thing will take care of it all. As you can see, FAQs are also being
5:11:56
generated by this prompt. Otherwise, we would have wrote another prompt for the
5:12:02
FAQ. And many things are there that should be in there in the article or
5:12:08
blog. So, yeah, now we can select our article or blog we can say.
5:12:16
So, we have the title. We don't want the outline. Let's say we'll take it from here from the
ChatGPT Made SEO Easy
5:12:25
introduction. It's a long article. I believe as you can see this last question is not completed but you can
5:12:33
click on continue generating and it will complete that. We don't want the last question. I think three questions or
5:12:39
four questions are sufficient for us. So now as we have copied it first of all we
5:12:46
need to make sure that our content is unique. It is not plagarized because we
5:12:51
can't publish or use the plagarized content. So we have to be sure that we
5:12:57
are using the unique content. For that we'll have to go to this site known
5:13:02
as duply checker. We'll click on this first link.
5:13:09
And now as you can see here we can copy and paste it. Paste we can just exclude
5:13:16
this last question as I told you. All right. Now our content our
5:13:23
article is pasted. Now we will check the
5:13:31
plagarism. All right. First of all, we'll have to tell them that we are not
5:13:37
a robot. And then we have to click on check
5:13:51
plugg. All right. So, it is showing maximum thousand words allowed per search. All right. So, let's just do one
5:13:58
thing. We'll do it because if you want to do thousand words, you'll have to go for
5:14:04
their pro version or the premium version. So, we now have
5:14:10
to use some part of it, not the complete
5:14:19
part. It's actually a long article. So, from the role we'll take
5:14:54
As you can see number of words is 5.5 and result found zero 0% plagarism
5:15:02
12% unique. All right so plarism is uh 3% I think that can be that can we can
5:15:09
neglect it and now let's check for the rest of this one.
5:15:27
Right. All right. Here we'll copy and paste
5:15:34
it. Check plagiarism.
5:15:51
As you can see number of words 671 0% plagism 12% unique. So I don't think it
5:15:57
will be a problem. So it is good to go I believe. And now we just copy and paste
5:16:03
it. So let's take it from
5:16:09
here till
5:16:26
here. All right. So this is our content now. So our content was not plaggarized
5:16:33
but let's just say if it is plagarized and is not unique. So what should we do then? We can simply put a prompt in chat
5:16:41
GBT that make it non-plagorized or make it unique or rephrase it. But let's say
5:16:49
uh that plagarized checker the duply checker mentions the particular lines of
5:16:55
where there is plagarism. So you can select that line put into chat GBD and ask them to rephrase or make it
5:17:02
plaggarism free. By doing this you can make the complete content plaggarism free. It is very easy. Or else you can
5:17:08
use a prompt from AIBM as I told you. All you have to do is to just type
5:17:14
plgarism free content writer and a particular prompt will come. You can
5:17:19
just put your content in that prompt and the rest chat duty will take care of.
5:17:25
All right. Now to boost your SEO strategy, you must focus on E A that is
5:17:31
expertise, authoritiveness and trustworthiness and keep that human element strong. Use chat GV to improve
5:17:39
your content with interesting verified facts and relevant examples. Create a
5:17:45
FAQ section to answer common questions and look for any missing information to fill in. These steps will help you make
5:17:52
highquality content that connects with your audience and ranks better in search
5:17:57
engines. So for that we'll write a prompt to uh chat GPT to include the
5:18:04
what we call FAQs and the uh statistics. We want to uh make use of statistics and
5:18:12
FAQs and include it in our content. So how should we do that? Let's just understand it.
5:18:18
Let's come to our chat GBT again. Now here what we'll do is we'll write a
5:18:23
simple prompt saying no no no first we go to the new
5:18:31
topic. Now here because otherwise it will keep on writing in that prompt itself. All right, we'll write
5:18:37
please add two what we call stats or you can write
5:18:45
statistics and one analogy and uh
5:18:53
FAQ section with
5:18:58
answers to this content.
5:19:04
ment draft to increase

engagement. All right. Now you want to uh if you want to paste a particular
5:19:17
section of your content, you can also do that or else you can paste the entire content. It's as per your choice. So let
5:19:25
me just paste a particular section. Let's just paste this one.
5:19:38
Uh all right let's
5:19:46
see. All right. So as you can see statistics studies show that engaging in
5:19:53
just 30 minutes of moderate physical activity each a day can reduce the risk of chronic disease like heart disease.
5:19:59
So these are the statistics and these are the analogies. And this is the FAQ section that you can include in your
5:20:06
content or a particular section of the content. Usually these statistics are included in the introduction part to
5:20:11
make it more interesting. So you can make use of it and do that. All right, moving forward. Let's understand the
5:20:18
chat gypty prompts for metatitles and descriptions. So crafting metatitles and
5:20:24

5:20:33
uh, now we'll be writing a particular prompt for it. For that, for the content part, I'll be
5:20:40
leaving the space content here
5:20:45
and create a meta
5:20:54
description and title for this content here. Just mean this one. All
5:21:03

You can you have to use the entire content but I'm just showing showing you. So you can use this one itself. It
5:21:58
will be more than enough. Don't have to worry about
5:22:08
it. And the focus keyword is
5:22:14

5:38:05
career. Whether you're starting fresh or looking to scale up, this road map will guide you every step of the way. Search
5:38:12
engine optimization. We're going to go through a series of questions and I'm going to answer those questions for you.
5:38:17
Okay. So, the first question that you might be asked in an interview is differentiate between do follows and no
5:38:25
follows. Okay. So, if you've taken or listened to my SEO courses on YouTube
5:38:30
for SEO, we we talked a lot about do follows and no follows. And and simply
5:38:36
put, I mean, do follows are just signals to the search engines to follow the link. So, there's a link on site A
5:38:43
pointing to site B. We're going to basically tell Google, Bing, and some of these other search engines, hey, go
5:38:49
ahead and follow that link. Now, a no follow is just the opposite. So, no follow link doesn't allow the search engine crawlers to follow it. So, if we
5:38:56
have a link on our site, site A pointing to site B, we could put a no follow tag
5:39:03
in there. And what that's going to do, it's going to signal to the crawlers,
5:39:08
hey, don't follow this link. So, in the end, if the crawlers don't follow the link, then there's not going to be any
5:39:15
link juice passed. And so Google is not going to give you credit or give that
5:39:20
site credit for having a link pointing to it or pointing to another site or
5:39:26
from another site. And so it's all about linking. So we can control if there's links on our site whether we want the
5:39:32
crawlers to recognize those or not simply with no follow tags. So just a
5:39:39
reminder, link juice is the reputation or equity passed from one website to another. So if you have a link on
5:39:46
another website and that website is of high quality, meaning their page authority, their domain authority is
5:39:51
high, they have a lot of content, you know, they're not spammy, they're really rich, and they're relevant, then you may
5:39:58
want to make sure that the link pointing from that site to your site is a no follow. So that way that Google can
5:40:04
recognize the link from that site to your site and basically that reputation
5:40:09
is going to be passed on to you. Okay? So that's a do follow versus a no follow. And why would we do a no follow?
5:40:16
Well, it depends. It really depends. A lot of social media platforms like Facebook have no follows. If you have a
5:40:23
lot of content, you may not want to be pushing out a lot of do follows. It could actually look bad from an external
5:40:30
linking standpoint. And so a lot of sites are really particular about who they want to pass link juice on to give
5:40:36
credit for the link. So it's a business decision at the end of the day. Okay, there's really no hard fast rule here
5:40:43
except from an SEO perspective. If I have a site and I have a lot of external links pointing outward to other sites.
5:40:50
I'm going to be particular about who I allow the search engine to follow and
5:40:55
what links I allow not to follow. So, here's an example of what they look like. So, do follow is simply just the
5:41:01
href. Notice the no follow has the the tag appended to it, the href tag with a
5:41:08
no follow. So, if the search engine's crawling your site and they see that no
5:41:13
follow there, they're not going to follow that link. And vice versa, if there's a link on another site pointing to yours and there's a no follow there,
5:41:19
you're not going to get credit. The search engines aren't going to pick up that link. Okay, so question two, what is 301 redirect and how is it different
5:41:27
from a 302 redirect? So 301 redirects tell users in the search engine
5:41:33
specifically that an original page has been moved and this is the keyword here permanently. So permanently moved. We're
5:41:40
going to explain that in a minute. So it's just moved from one page to another. And so if we don't have a page
5:41:47
anymore, we have a new page. Let's just say you built a new website with new URLs. You want to make sure the old page
5:41:54
is pointing to the new page with a 301 redirect. So if a 301 redirect is
5:42:01
permanent, then a 302 is temporary. So we want the search engines to recognize
5:42:07
that we have 301 permanent redirects in place. Why? Because if we have
5:42:12
temporary, then it might alert Google to not keep that page in its search engine
5:42:19
rankings because it's temporary. So why would Google want to keep a temporary page or even a page that is pointing to
5:42:26
another page on a temporary basis? So they may remove both pages from its
5:42:31
index. Okay. But if we have something permanent in place, Google may say, "Okay, this page is permanently linking
5:42:38
to another page or redirecting to another page. Therefore, it's stable.
5:42:43
It's permanent. We're going to keep that new page in the index and eventually remove the old page." So really
5:42:50
something permanent is more stable in the eyes of the search engine. Something temporary may not be as stable in the
5:42:56
eyes of say Google and if they don't see it as stable then they may remove both pages from the index. Okay. So the idea
5:43:03
is we want to be found in Google search index and we get it sometimes pages go away for a variety of reasons and if it
5:43:10
does go away just make sure you have a new page for it and that new page is a 301 permanent redirect. Okay. So
5:43:18
question three, why are back links important in SEO? Well, we kind of
5:43:23
hinted on that a bit with the no follow because if we have a link from another website pointing to ours and that link
5:43:30
from that other website is really relevant and and it has a high page and
5:43:35
domain authority, then it's going to benefit us. And so backlinks are important because if we have backlinks
5:43:41
from high quality sites, it's going to improve the credibility of our site, especially if it's a do follow tag. So
5:43:49
the search engines are going to recognize the relationship between the site that has a link pointing to us.
5:43:55
Okay? So it's just going to build our credibility. It's going to increase increase our domain authority. And then
5:44:01
the net effect of that is if we're credible and we have high domain authority, then that's going to increase
5:44:08
the rankings of our pages. And when the pages increase in ranking, then we're
5:44:14
going to get a more of a lion share of the traffic for certain keywords that our pages are found for. And if our
5:44:20
pages are found and getting traffic, then because we have increased rankings, we're likely going to have increased
5:44:25
traffic. And then it's just a snowball effect. So more traffic leads to more engagement and conversions. So the whole
5:44:32
idea for SEO is remember you have an onpage strategy and an off- page strategy. Building external links is
5:44:39
part of an off- page SEO strategy and we want to make sure that you know we are
5:44:45
relevant in the form of a link or in the form of content on other highquality sites. Being on a high quality site only
5:44:52
benefits us because again increases our d domain authority. Google sees us as more relevant. Therefore, our pages are
5:44:59
going to benefit by ranking higher and therefore when we rank higher, we get more traffic. So, it's a snowball
5:45:05
effect. So, having back links is important because it snowballs all the way through to conversions. Okay. So,
5:45:12
what are the best practices to rank your videos on YouTube? This is a great
5:45:17
question. Really great question given the importance of videos especially with SEO because videos are found. YouTube in
5:45:24
itself is a search engine. So, if we have a video, how are we going to get it to rank on YouTube? Well, first things
5:45:29
first, you never want to put a video out there and want it to rank if it's not engaging or informative. So, make sure
5:45:37
you go ahead and follow the best practices of having engaging and informative content in your video. Now,
5:45:45
once you have that video in place, you want to optimize it. And then some of the key factors for optimizing a video
5:45:52
are you want to choose a title that has high search volume and low difficulty.
5:45:57
Just as you would keyword for example for a web page, you want to choose a title with a keyword in it that has high
5:46:05
volume and low difficulty, i.e. low competition. Okay? So you want a nice ratio there. And you know what? You want
5:46:11
to choose a title that's going to get people to watch the video, too. So, it's not all about just choosing a title just
5:46:16
for the sake of high volume. You also have to choose something that's relevant, that's going to be catchy as
5:46:22
well. And then with that title goes the description. So, you want a description that's very relevant to your title,
5:46:28
okay? Because most people aren't going to click on a video just for the sake of the title. They're going to want to
5:46:34
probably get a sneak peek via the description of what it is. So, again, you want to optimize that description,
5:46:39
but make sure the description is is just as snazzy as the title. Okay? You also
5:46:44
want to use accurate and relevant video tags just as you would on Twitter or
5:46:49
Facebook. Tag these videos, okay? So, make sure your title tag length doesn't
5:46:55
exceed 100 characters because it will get chopped off. So, again, that goes back to just writing something really
5:47:01
short and to the point that's going to grab somebody's attention. Okay? You also want to upload a captivating
5:47:07
thumbnail, something that's relevant that's going to grab somebody's attention. And then again, we set it
5:47:14
similar to the video tags. We want to use relevant hashtags. Again, just as you would with Twitter and Facebook, go
5:47:20
ahead and throw some hashtags in there that people could see because people search via hashtagging. And then this
5:47:26
goes without saying, you did all the work, created a really great video, it's engaging, it's informative, you
5:47:32
optimized it. Feel free to promote your video on other social media platforms,
5:47:38
okay? Don't just stick with YouTube, per se. So the benefit here is if you post
5:47:43
it on Facebook or LinkedIn or whatever platform of your choice and it gets engagement, people click on the link, go
5:47:50
to YouTube, they're going to like it, and then other people are going to see that engagement. They're going to see
5:47:55
how many people liked it or how many subscribers you have. So promote your videos to help you with the ranking of
5:48:03
the video on YouTube. So that does play into it. So go ahead and promote it so other people can watch it, like it,
5:48:10
comment, etc. And that's going to engage other people to want to do the same. So what is mobile first indexing? This is a
5:48:18
really important and timely question. Mobile first indexing means Google's
5:48:23
just using mobile friendly content for indexing and ranking websites. So in
5:48:29
other words, Google, for example, has two bots. They have the traditional desktop bot and they have a smartphone
5:48:35
bot. And eventually everybody that has a website is going to be migrated over to
5:48:41
the smartphone bot. And so if that smartphone bot goes to your website and starts crawling, what do you think
5:48:46
they're looking for? Their smartphone bot, they're looking for mobile friendly content. If it's not mobile friendly,
5:48:53
meaning the page isn't designed for a smartphone browser or let's just say the
5:48:59
images are way too large or you have to expand the text just to read it. You
5:49:05
know, a lot of these these issues that somebody would have just simply trying to read something on a web page on their
5:49:12
mobile device, Google's not going to grab that content. So, you want to make sure it's mobile friendly so it gets
5:49:17
indexed. And so if your website has a responsive design, Google will rank your
5:49:23
website based on its performance on mobile devices. Okay? So you want to make sure that your website is mobile
5:49:30
friendly. And if you're in an interview and somebody asks you this question, you could even take it a step further and
5:49:35
say, "Look, I'm going to measure how friendly my w my website is for mobile devices in Google Search Console."
5:49:42
Because Google Search Console has a report that will show you what pages on your website are not mobile friendly.
5:49:49
And it's not a guarantee, but I could tell you if I'm Google and I'm crawling your site with my smartphone bot and
5:49:56
that page or one of my pages is not mobile friendly, I'm probably not going to index it or rank it. So, you want to
5:50:03
leverage that report in Google Search Console to see what pages are mobile friendly. So, that's a little bonus for
5:50:10
you to really impress the interviewer who asks you this question because how
5:50:15
are you going to know if one of your pages is mobile friendly or not if you don't look at a report? So, keep an eye
5:50:21
on Google search consoles mo mobile usability report. Okay, number six, list
5:50:26
down the most important local SEO ranking factors. Okay, so organic local
5:50:33
ranking is just as important as anything else in organic search because if you
5:50:39
have a local business, you want to use the likes of say Google my business to show up when somebody types in, you
5:50:46
know, looking for a florist or you're looking for a coffee shop. So, what you
5:50:51
want to do is you want to create a web page for every product and service. Okay? You also want to opt for your
5:50:57
business listings on Google My Business and and there are plenty of other local
5:51:02
business directories out there like Yelp for example or Bing even has one. So go
5:51:08
ahead and also make sure you have a business listing as well. But since Google in the United States has a huge
5:51:14
market share, you want to start with Google first. You want to update your NAP citations on your website. Maintain
5:51:21
consistency of your NAP. Okay. So, NAP is name, address, phone number. So, you
5:51:28
want to make sure that that's current and consistent. So, if you have a number on your website, make sure it's the same
5:51:34
number on Google My Business. Okay? You can embed a Google map on your website. You could certainly optimize the meta
5:51:41
tags and content not only on your web pages, but within your Google My Business directory. So you can add your
5:51:48
business to other local directories like I mentioned Yelp and then also just as
5:51:53
important opt for reviews and ratings. Okay, so the more reviews the h you have
5:51:58
the better off you are. Okay, so I always say this with or with local search. Three of the main factors in
Digital Marketing Roadmap
5:52:05
showing up for local search on say Google is obviously the keyword. The
5:52:11
second is the proximity of where that person is and then third is the reviews.
5:52:16
So, you can't really control the proximity, but you can control the keyword and you can control the reviews
5:52:23
to some degree. So, work hard at getting reviews for your business, but at the same time, you can certainly work in
5:52:30
some keywords, let's just say for your product and service pages on your website, but also you can translate that
5:52:36
over to Google My Business. Okay? So working in those keywords, making sure your your number, your address, your
5:52:44
name, they're all consistent and and really just spreading your the the
5:52:49
business out on other directories. That's really all these are really key factors for local SEO. Okay, so question
5:52:56
number seven, how to avoid duplicate content, getting penalized for duplicate
5:53:02
content. So, for example, if you have two different versions of a web page, you may result in a duplicate content
5:53:08
issue. So, it's just SEO 101. You never want to have two two or more pages with
5:53:13
the same content. So, what do we do? Well, we can avoid this and having Google penalize us by again setting up a
5:53:21
301 redirect. Remember, 301's are permanent. We can also use what they call a canonical tag. And a canonical
5:53:28
tag basically alerts the search engines as to which page is the original. Okay,
5:53:34
so if we have an original page, we want to point to that page with a canonical tag. And then the third option is opt
5:53:39
for preferred domain in Google search console. Okay, so if you have multiple domains, make sure you set up a primary
5:53:47
one in search console. So those are ways to work around it. of this three, I
5:53:52
would always go with the canonical tags because that's just a tag that's going to sit on the page that's going to alert Google as to what the original is just
5:53:59
in case they get their hands on the duplicate. So all the pages that have the same content are going to have the
5:54:05
same canonical tag pointing to one page. So again, three ones are permanent. You
5:54:10
can simply just redirect one to the other if you end up having duplication or you could just tell the search
5:54:16
engines, hey, this is the original page or you can go through search console. Okay, number eight. What are the tactics
5:54:23
to increase a web page speed? Okay, so what are some of the tactics? Well, when
5:54:28
you build a site, especially for mobile, you want to keep it as simple as possible. And what I mean by simple as
5:54:35
possible really, I mean, hey, use a simple website design. Don't get overly creative. if you will. Most websites,
5:54:41
all websites have images. You're not going to be able to get around that, but just make sure you optimize your images.
5:54:47
In other words, don't have such a large image size. If you don't need something very large, don't have it. Okay? You
5:54:53
want to improve server response time. And what do we mean by that? Well, your site's sitting on a server somewhere.
5:54:59
You could own that server or you can be renting it out from, say, Amazon Web Services or, let's just say, GoDaddy as
5:55:07
your register. They also have web hosting. Well, if you have it on, say,
5:55:12
GoDaddy server, you may be sharing that server with other businesses and at
5:55:17
certain times of the day, other businesses may get a lot of traffic and suck up a lot of bandwidth. What is that
5:55:23
going to do? That's going to reduce the server response time for your site. And so, you want to make sure you have a an
5:55:29
idea of, you know, what server your web page or website is on. And you want to
5:55:34
be able to can have some control over that because if your server response is slow, that's going to slow down
5:55:41
everything else in terms of loading in the browser and that's not going to be good for SEO. Okay. Optimize your code.
5:55:48
We mean by optimize minimize. When we say minimize, we mean get rid of some of the redundant code. If you have CSS, you
5:55:55
know, get rid of chop some of the get rid of the JavaScript you're not using. So that's what we mean by optimizing
5:56:01
code. Reduce redirects. Okay. Ideally, you just want to have one redirect in place. You don't want to create a daisy
5:56:08
chain, so to speak, of redirecting and redirecting after that. That's never going to bode well and it's going to
5:56:13
slow things down as well. Enable browser caching. So, if you enable browser caching, basically, if somebody comes
5:56:20
back to the page they've been on, say 2 days ago, they're probably going to see a cache version of that page. And then
5:56:26
opt for the content delivery network as well. So, these are some of the ways to
5:56:33
reduce page speed. Now, if you're curious about the page speed of your website, you can always go to Google's
5:56:40
page speed insights tool. And all you have to do is just Google page speed insights or even just something generic
5:56:47
like Google page speed and you're going to get this tool, page speed insights. And all you need to do is just plug in a
5:56:54
URL. When you plug in the URL, Google is going to analyze the URL for both mobile
5:56:59
and desktop. And so here we could see Google gives a score. So we could see the score for mobile and we could see
5:57:05
the score for desktop just by clicking on desktop. And so here I could see some
5:57:10
of the issues that the site may be having in terms of page load time for
5:57:16
their desktop. If I flip over to mobile, you know, here I could see some other issues. For example, they have a server
5:57:23
static assets with efficient cash policy. Now, if you're not sure what the heck that means, you can always just
5:57:28
click on it and you can see some specifics here and or you can just always Google it as well. Uh here you
5:57:35
got the reduce the impact of third-party code. Okay, so that's another thing. Uh
5:57:41
reduce JavaScript execution time. So again, going back to a lot of some of the comments we made about coding. Okay,
5:57:47
some sometimes too much code or code not functioning as well as it should will tend to slow down the site. Okay, so you
5:57:55
can use page speed insights. You can always get a glimpse of how pages are loading simply by also going to for
5:58:02
example Google analytics under behavior. Okay, you can go to sight speed and if
5:58:08
you click on overview, okay, Google, what Google does is they do a sampling
5:58:14
of pages over time. And in this case, based on 89 page views, they have an
5:58:20
average page load time. And so you can get a sense of how quick specific pages
5:58:26
load or your site overall simply by looking at the site speed overview report in Google Analytics to get a
5:58:32
sense of how quick your pages are loading. Now there are certain factors
5:58:38
that do affect load time. So obviously the way the page is built with the code,
5:58:43
the images etc. But also the browser. Each browser loads differently. Okay? So you want to take a look at it by
5:58:49
browser, also by country. Every country has a different network. You can be in
5:58:54
the United States and have worse network service than you do say in you know co
5:59:02
uh Ivory Coast in Africa. Okay. So it really depends on the network you're on. So and also the page every page is built
5:59:09
differently. So you want to get a sense of what pages are loading quicker and which pages are not. You can simply just
5:59:15
go to page timings in Google Analytics and you get a sense of what pages do not
5:59:21
load fast and which ones do and maybe hone in on the pages that aren't loading
5:59:26
fast and address those pages first. Okay, so you have two tools at your disposal, one Google Analytics and one
5:59:34
page speed insights. Okay, so let's look at question number nine here. So when
5:59:39
should an individual target short tail and longtail keywords? Okay, so remember
5:59:45
short tail are usually one to two keywords very broad in nature. Longtail
5:59:50
keywords, maybe three, four keywords in a query or maybe an entire sentence.
5:59:56
Those are considered longtail keywords. So usually short tail keywords have
6:00:01
higher volume but also higher competition. Longer tail keywords usually have lower uh volume but also
6:00:08
lower competition. But the great thing about longtail keywords, the conversion rate will tend to be a little bit higher
6:00:15
than say a short tail because it's less vague and more specific. So you can use short tail keywords if you're trying to
6:00:21
drive a lot of visitors because those keywords are going to be vague or broad in nature. Longtail keywords are used
6:00:28
for targeted pages such as product pages and articles. So if you have a specific product with a long name, you can
6:00:34
certainly optimize that page for that product name. Again, the product name may have low volume, but if somebody
6:00:42
types in exactly that product name, you show up, the chance of you them converting are going to be very high.
6:00:48
So, you don't have to always be that specific with the product name, but try and be as specific as you possibly can
6:00:54
in order to get somebody to click on your link in the search engine results
6:00:59
and get them over to your site to convert. Okay, so those are really the big differences. short tail, very broad,
6:01:06
very vague, a lot of volume, but also a lot of competition. But hey, if you're ranking for a short tail keyword, you're
6:01:13
probably going to get a lot of traffic, the conversion rates may not be as high as something say longtail where hey,
6:01:20
maybe you're just honed in on a few set number of products and you're not care,
6:01:25
you don't care a lot about the traffic, you just care about getting the relevant traffic to your site to convert. Okay,
6:01:31
number 10. What are the important elements to focus while developing a website? So, we're talking in terms of
6:01:38
SEO. Okay, so if somebody asked me this question in an interview, what am I going to focus on while developing a
6:01:45
website? Well, the answers are right here. You talked about mobile. Mobile is so important because a lot of websites
6:01:51
are going to be indexed with Google smartphone bot. So, mobile usability is
6:01:57
very important. So, we need to make sure our website is responsive for mobile. Just some basic practices when it comes
6:02:03
to site architecture navigation. We want to have a simple URL structure. Okay. No
6:02:09
overly cumbersome. The navigation should simply be clean and neat. Okay. If you have five products, okay, maybe you have
6:02:17
uh in your navigation, you have something called products with all five listed or you have all five products in the main navigation. The key is you just
6:02:24
want to make it clean and neat and easy for somebody to find. The the rule of thumb is if it's good for the end user,
6:02:29
it's probably going to be good for Google. But if complicated for the end user, it's probably going to be complicated for Google. You always want
6:02:35
to create a sitemap. Now, what is that site map? A sitemap is simply just a formatted file with to includes all your
6:02:43
URLs and assets, your images, and your videos. They're going to be sitting on your server as well. So, you want Google
6:02:50
or these these bots to be able to find your pages and assets. And by the way,
6:02:56
you want to take it a step further and make sure you upload that sitemap which is sitting in the root directory,
6:03:02
meaning domain.com/sitemap.xml. Okay, you want to take that sitemap and make sure you
6:03:09
input that sitemap location in Google search console. That way, Google search
6:03:14
console has a one-way ticket to grab the elements in the sitemap. Another
6:03:20
important element to focus on while developing a website is having a robot's text file. And all a robot's text file
6:03:25
is, it's like a lock, I always say, to a house. So if you lock a door in your house, nobody's going to be able to get
6:03:31
in that door. So that's all a robot's text file is. You're telling Google and
6:03:37
these other bots that are coming across your site what's locked and what's not locked, meaning what they have access
6:03:42
to, what they don't have access to. So, you want to be able to make sure you have a robots's text file if you're
6:03:49
trying to not index specific pages of your website because if you tell Google,
6:03:54
don't crawl these pages or this directory, they're not going to get crawled. And if they don't get crawled, they're not going to get indexed. So,
6:04:00
robots text file is an important element to focus on while you're developing your website. And while you're developing
6:04:06
your website, it could be on a, you know, in a directory just called new website. So, you probably want to have
6:04:13
new website as the directory in the robots text file. And just to let Google
6:04:18
know, don't go into this directory because it's my new website. I'm not ready to go live yet. So, you don't want
6:04:24
it indexed. So, there are a lot of reasons to have robots text files.
6:04:29
That's the main reason. Site map. You want Google to get these pages and assets quickly. Okay. You want to make
6:04:36
sure that your site architecture navigation is in order. You want to make sure your site is mobile friendly and
6:04:43
you also want to make sure you have content on your website. That's the key because that's what's going to keep
6:04:48
people on the website and engaged. And when I say content, I don't necessarily just mean words. I also mean videos. I
6:04:56
also mean images. You know, something interactive. Okay? You want to keep people engaged. That's the key behind
6:05:03
it. Trust me, if if an end user finds your site engaging, Google is likely going to find your site engaging. Okay?
6:05:10
So those are good brownie points to bring up if somebody asks you this question in an interview. So just to
6:05:16
recap here, it's important to have a better site structure so the bots can easily access and index content. With a
6:05:23
responsive design helps to make your website mobile friendly and userfriendly. Would also increase the
6:05:28
amount of time a user spends on your website which may improve your site's ranking. Sitemap is simply just a file
6:05:34
that helps search engine bots to understand the structure of the website. Okay. how many pages are on your website
6:05:40
and where are they located along with the videos and images. Okay. And then the robots text just instructs the
6:05:45
search engine crawlers to understand what pages should not be indexed. Okay. This is simply just a text file and it's
6:05:52
added to the root directory. Again, think like a door. Think of a lock. Okay. You can tell you can lock whatever
6:05:58
doors you want in your house. Think of it that way. Okay. So, those are our questions for SEO. Again, if you have
6:06:04
any additional questions or if there are other questions maybe you've been asked in an SEO interview, then go ahead and
6:06:11
add them to the comments section below. We'd love to hear from you. Now, we're going to turn our attention to search
6:06:17
engine marketing. So, let's turn our full attention to search engine marketing. So, we're moving away from
6:06:24
SEO and over to payclick. And so, you really have to know your stuff here. You
6:06:30
really do. Uh, so a lot of the questions we're going to ask are going to be centered around Google Ads, formerly
6:06:36
known as Google Ads Words. And so if you're familiar with Google Ads, the
6:06:41
platform, then you should have no problems whatsoever answering these questions. But that's why we're here and
6:06:48
that's why you're watching. So there's anything you want to add to any of these questions, as a reminder, feel free to
6:06:54
comment under the video. And so right out of the gate, question 11, what is ad scheduling? So, ad scheduling is a
6:07:01
feature in Google Ads. And really, all it does is allow you, the advertiser, to
6:07:07
set up certain hours or days you want your ads to show. It's as simple as that. So, if you have a customer that
6:07:13
you're running ads for on Google search and let's just say they have a
6:07:18
restaurant and they're closed during certain hours of the week, then you can go in to the ad scheduler and schedule
6:07:25
your ads to not show when they're closed, as an example. Okay? Because if somebody calls and they're not there to
6:07:32
answer the phone, then it's not going to be good for the restaurant or you, the advertiser. And so that's why they have
6:07:39
the ad scheduling. So it ensures your ads are not running when they're performing poorly. Let's just say, you
6:07:46
know, you're running a business and you just don't get that much traffic during the weekends. Well, you can go in and
6:07:52
adjust accordingly. It also is there to make sure you could serve your customers when you do have limited client service
6:07:59
hours. So, let's just say you have a customer service team that's going to answer phones for a couple hours a day.
6:08:06
Well, again, you can schedule your ads to show during those couple of hours a day. And then really what it comes down
6:08:13
to is you're making sure you can satisfy customer demand and supply. And so that means showing your ads when you you can
6:08:21
best fulfill the customer's needs. Okay? And so that's really what it's all about. Uh and that's what ad scheduling
6:08:27
is. So take advantage of ad scheduling. Schedule it according to the business hours. Schedule according to how they
6:08:33
can best serve the customer. Schedule the ads when it's performing best. And don't schedule the ads when you know
6:08:40
you're going to have poor performance. Okay. So next question. What are the different ad formats available on Google
6:08:46
Ads? It's a trick question because it really does come down to what network
6:08:52
you're advertising on. So, Google has two networks, the search network and the display network. Okay? So, on the search
6:09:00
network, there's only one ad format and that's text. Okay? So, Google recently
6:09:05
changed the format of the text ads. Now, they're called expanded text ads. So here you could see you can have up to
6:09:11
three headlines and two description lines. And then you can also have ad
6:09:17
extensions. And so you can see here underneath the ad you have what they call site links. So shop by category in
6:09:24
here headphones onair headphones those are all site links to specific pages on
6:09:30
the site. So text ads are available only on the search network but they're also available on the display network as
6:09:36
well. Then you have responsive display ads. Now, desponsive responsive display ads are only on Google's display
6:09:43
network. Okay. So, here you could see some samples of responsive display ads
6:09:49
and these ads adjust their size and format depending on the space available. So, again, you could have text ads or
6:09:56
you can have display ads. Now, display ads again come in different sizes. So,
6:10:01
you can create ads you for a variety of different sizes. for example, 250x 250
6:10:07
or 468x60. So, those are some of the different ad types. There's there's a
6:10:13
plethora of different ad sizes you can choose. However, your ad's not going to
6:10:18
show on a website if they don't have that particular size available. So, it's
6:10:23
always best practice to create different ads, but create ads in different sizes
6:10:30
as well. Okay? and then have a backup text ad as well just in case the site doesn't even display a display ad for
6:10:38
you or serve up a display ad. So you can have a text ad as a backup. Okay, so lots of different ad sizes, but this is
6:10:44
the second ad format. That's responsive display. And again, the responsive part is Google will
6:10:51
automatically show the ad that's best performing based on a series of headlines, descriptions, and images that
6:10:59
you you provide Google. And so the responsive part is, hey, if this combination of headline, description,
6:11:06
and image work best, meaning it has the best click-through rate, then Google's going to serve up that ad. So that's why
6:11:12
they call it responsive. So obviously you can have just an image ad that's not responsive again across different ad
6:11:20
sizes. You know they could be again 250x 250, 300 by 300, 468x 60. There's a
6:11:28
number of different sizes. Google can provide you that information. But the one thing to note here is that when you
6:11:34
do create an image ad, it could be JPEG, it could be interactive, or it could be
6:11:41
static. So different types of image ad formats like PNG for example or it could
6:11:48
be a static or it could be interactive. So definitely take advantage of the
6:11:54
different opportunities uh meaning a static ad versus an interactive ad. You
6:12:00
may want to have two variations of that so you could see which one works best. Okay. There's also app promotion ads. So
6:12:07
these ads are used to drive app downloads. So, you're going to have to set up a campaign accordingly. Okay. But
6:12:13
here you can see this is what it looks like with a call to action. So, it allows you to go ahead and click and
6:12:18
install that app. So, that's an app promotion. Again, if you have an app and you want to promote it, you can use this
6:12:25
type of ad format to align with a campaign that's driving traffic to
6:12:32
download your app. Okay? And of course, you have video ads. Well, Google owns YouTube. And so if you have videos, you
6:12:38
have the opportunity to advertise on YouTube. Okay? So these ads can be standalone or inserted into other
6:12:45
streaming video content. And so to me, video ads work well with specific
6:12:51
strategies. And what's one strategy you would use a video ad for? Brand awareness or education, explainer
6:12:58
videos. And so YouTube allows you the advertiser the opportunity to get your
6:13:05
ad, your service, your product in front of a lot of eyeballs. So that's the beauty of video ads. They attract a lot
6:13:12
of eyeballs and definitely help with the strategy of say brand awareness. Okay. Another ad format going back to the
6:13:19
search network is shopping ads. So if you sell shoes then you may want to
6:13:24
think about having a campaign for shopping. So, shopping ads work with Google Merchant. So, Google Merchant is
6:13:31
another Google product and basically Google Merchant allows you to manage your inventory. So, if you have a
6:13:38
hundred different types of shoes that you're selling, you can upload your inventory to Google Merchant connects
6:13:44
and talks to Google Ads. So, basically what you're doing, you're setting up your your campaign in Google Ads and
6:13:50
connecting your inventory from Google Merchant to Google Ads. And so the great
6:13:56
thing about the shopping campaign is it puts your product front and center. It
6:14:01
puts the price, it puts any promotion that you have and it puts the brand all front and center. So when somebody does
6:14:08
type in, let's just say lime green sneakers or women's sneakers and this
6:14:14
particular shoe shows up here, the third one from the left, then somebody's going
6:14:19
to see it's from the United Colors of Beniton. It's a woman's shoe. It's on Amazon and it costs $45. So, the great
6:14:26
thing about shopping ads is if somebody's interested, they're going to click. Okay? If somebody's not interested, say, well, you know, it's a
6:14:33
little bit more expensive. I can get something similar, another shoe on Amazon for less. Okay? They're probably
6:14:40
going to click on that particular ad. So, again, the great thing about shopping ads, put your product front and center with any promotion, the price,
6:14:47
the brand. So, if somebody clicks on it, then they're probably serious buyers.
6:14:52
Okay? Okay, so that's the beauty of shopping ads. It allows you to get your product out there. And on the search
6:14:58
network, it's a cost per click. So you're only paying for the click. So if somebody looks at it but doesn't click,
6:15:04
you're not paying for that. So that's the beauty of shopping ads. And so you can showcase your shopping ads. So these
6:15:11
ads have an image and a description that expand when clicked. So you can provide
6:15:17
more information, more product and store information as well. You also have callonly ads. Okay, so callonly ads are
6:15:25
enabled to users to connect with your business directly using the phone number provided. Okay, so it allows somebody on
6:15:32
a mobile phone who in this example is searching for drywall repair. Well, if you're in the business of drywall
6:15:38
repair, you can have your ad show up on mobile with a phone number and somebody
6:15:43
can easily click on that phone number and just call you directly. Now, the way call only ads work is you're still
6:15:51
getting charged for the click. Okay? So, anytime somebody clicks and calls, you're going to get charged and you're
6:15:57
going to get charged just as you would if somebody clicked on your ad. So, it's works the same way. So, it's a cost per
6:16:03
click. Again, this is on search. So, search is cost per click. And the beauty about call only is again you can track
6:16:11
the calls right in Google Ads. So you can have Google Ads track how many people click on the number and you can
6:16:17
even count those calls as conversions. If they meet a certain criteria, for example, the criteria is somebody talks
6:16:25
to you for a minimum of 60 seconds or 1 minute. Then Google will count that as a conversion. So you can monitor calls
6:16:32
right in Google Ads and it's a cost perclick model. So you can actually see what the average cost per click is. So
6:16:38
moving on, question 13. Okay. What is RLSA and how does it work? Well,
6:16:44
RLSA stands for remarketing list for search ads. So, if you're familiar with remarketing on display, it's similar.
6:16:51
They just call it RLSA. Okay? So, it enables you, the advertiser, to customize your ads for people who have
6:16:58
visited your site, just like a typical remarketing campaign. Okay? So, you could tailor your bids and ads to these
6:17:05
visitors when they're searching on Google and search partner sites. Okay? So there two basic strategies for using
6:17:11
RLSA. Okay. So you can optimize bids for existing keywords for visitors or you
6:17:16
can bid on keywords that you don't normally bid on just for people who recently visited your site or converted
6:17:22
on your site. Key here is you're the one that's picking the customer. You're the
6:17:28
one that's enabling the list. If you're trying to target people who went to your site and didn't convert, well, you could
6:17:34
certainly optimize your bids for existing keywords for people who went to your site and didn't convert, or you
6:17:40
could set up a whole new campaign for RLSA and have a different set of
6:17:45
keywords with a different ad because you know who you're talking to. You're talking to somebody who's already been
6:17:51
to your site. They know your brand. They just didn't purchase. And so, this all happens on the search network. And
6:17:56
that's the beauty of remarketing is one, you know who your audience is because you're the one establishing that
6:18:02
audience. And two, you're the one creating the ad. So you can talk directly to that audience when they see
6:18:07
your ad. Again, in this case, on search. So that's RLSA, remarketing list for
6:18:13
search ads. I recommend pretty much any industry, any client, any customer run
6:18:19
remarketing list for search advertising and remarketing for display. So, those are two key campaigns you should always
6:18:26
recommend running to a client because one, again, you're defining the audience. Two, you're the one that's
6:18:33
talking directly to the audience because you know who the audience is. And three, if they see the ad and they click on it
6:18:39
again because it's cost per click, then the chances of converting are going to be higher because they've already been
6:18:46
to your website. They know who you are. And so, if they click on your ad again, then they must be interested. So those
6:18:52
are all the benefits of running an RLSA campaign. Okay. So number 14, what types
6:18:57
of audiences can be used in GDN, Google's display network. So a lot of
6:19:03
different audiences here. Okay. So let's go through them. So you have affinity
6:19:08
audiences. So basically affinity audiences are basically what are people's interest and habits? What do
6:19:15
they have an affinity for? Are there food sites, travel sites, shopping sites, fashion? Okay, so that's what
6:19:23
affinity really relates to. Okay, then you have inmarket, custom intent, life
6:19:29
events. These are what they're researching or planning for. So again, it could be travel, it can be finance,
6:19:35
etc. Okay, you have remarketing. We just went over that with the remarketing list for search advertising, RL LSA. And so
6:19:42
when remarketing, it's an audience that has interacted with your website. So
6:19:47
they either came from mobile or came from mobile and didn't convert or female
6:19:53
came from mobile and didn't convert. So you're the one defining the audience there. You also have a similar audience.
6:19:59
So this is what Google creates on your behalf. So these are users with a
6:20:04
similar interest to your site visitors. So Google is monitoring the type of
6:20:09
traffic that's coming to your site and based on that traffic, they're going to create a similar audience and then you
6:20:15
have a custom match. So what you know about your customers activities basically. So these are all the
6:20:20
different audience types and you can see the different types of ads available. Okay. So notice the far right column
6:20:28
video ads. So video ads are available to every one of these audience types. Why?
6:20:33
Because YouTube. So Google knows what people's interests and habits are based
6:20:38
on the videos they watch. They know what they're looking for. Okay? They you know
6:20:43
that they've been to your website because they're cooking. So you can remarket them. Okay? So video ads are very powerful tool for any one of these
6:20:51
audience types. So next question. What are the types of keyword matching available in Google ads? Okay. So this
6:20:57
is a good question. Very important. If you're going to manage a Google Ads account and a campaign, you have to be
6:21:04
aware of the different match types. You can't just go broad match. That's a sign of somebody who doesn't know what
6:21:10
they're doing is by bidding on a one keyword phrase. That's a short tail
6:21:15
keyword. If you think back to SEO, we have our longtail and our short tail keywords. The worst thing you could do
6:21:21
is bid on a keyword, short tail keyword, that's broad match. Because what is broad match? basically broad match or
6:21:29
keywords that appear when a user searches any word in the phrase. Now you can define
6:21:35
specifically what you want your ads to appear for in terms of keywords. And when I say specifically, you can use a
6:21:41
phrase match. So phrase match are ads that appear only when a user searches for that exact keyword phrase in the
6:21:48
precise order, but with some additional words in the beginning or at the end of the query. Okay, so usually these are
6:21:54
sentences. So, you could be, you know, bidding on red Adidas running shoes and
6:22:02
somebody could type in looking for red Adidas running shoes in Portland,
6:22:07
Oregon. Okay, as an example. Okay, so as long as red Adidas running shoes are in order in that keyword phrase, then your
6:22:15
ad's going to appear because it's a phrase match. And then you can get really specific by doing an exact match.
6:22:22
So, exact match are keywords that are triggered only when that keyword and
6:22:27
exactly that keyword phrase is queried. So, if you do an exact match for red
6:22:33
Adidas running shoes and somebody types in only red Adidas running shoes, then
6:22:38
that's an exact match and your ad's going to appear. So, let's take a look at these again. So, you got broad match.
6:22:44
Okay, we got a term cheap smartphone. So if somebody types in smartphone, cheap
6:22:50
phone, smart mobile, phone cheap, any one of those combinations, your ad's going to appear. Now, there's one thing
6:22:56
you can do for broad match, and it's called broad match modifier. So you could put a plus sign in front of the
6:23:04
keyword. For example, let's just say you really want to emphasize the word cheap. Okay, you're selling really inexpensive
6:23:11
smartphones. Okay, not just any smartphone, but an inexpensive smartphone. So you can put a plus sign
6:23:17
in front of cheap. And so if somebody puts in, you know, just smartphone or smart mobile, your ad's not going to
6:23:24
show up because the word the keyword query has to contain sheep. So anytime
6:23:30
you put a plus in front of the keyword query you're bidding on, then that means that keyword has to be part of the
6:23:36
keyword phrase. So that's a a broad match modifier, if you will, and that prevents you from getting unwanted
6:23:42
impressions. So, we have phrase match again, blue smartphone. So, somebody
6:23:47
could type in smartphone in blue color. Cheap blue smartphone. Notice though,
6:23:53
the second one where it says smartphone in blue color, your ad's not necessarily going to show up because guess what?
6:23:58
Blue smartphone is the keyword query and your your that the query here is not in
6:24:05
that order. So, remember, in order for you to show up for phrase match, the keyword has to be in that order. So, I'm
6:24:11
looking for a blue smartphone that is less than $100. Okay, that could be
6:24:17
somebody's query. Blue smartphone was in that query in that order. So, if somebody says, "Looking for a smartphone
6:24:24
that happens to be blue, less than $100," then your ad is not going to show
6:24:29
up. So, remember, it has to be in that ex precise order. One thing I want us go
6:24:34
back to on the phrase match, notice that there's quotes around the keyword. Anytime you see quotes around the
6:24:40
keyword, that signifies it's a phrase match. Because if we look at exact match, notice there are brackets around
6:24:45
the keyword red shoe. That signifies it's an exact match. So if you put brackets around a keyword, then you're
6:24:52
signify signaling to Google that this is an exact match and I only want to show up for the keyword red shoe. Well, the
6:24:59
only option that will work here is the second one, red shoes. Okay, so because that's an exact match. Okay. So,
6:25:06
disregard the first and the third one because shoe and red color is not going to work and footwear that's red is not
6:25:11
going to work because this is an exact match. So, you're saying I only want to show up for the keyword red shoe and
6:25:17
Google recognizes plurals and singulars together. So, if somebody did type in red shoes, then your ad is going to show
6:25:24
up. Okay. So, moving on. What are some of the reasons as to why your ads could
6:25:29
have been rejected? It happens to the best of us. And if you're writing ads and they get rejected, it could be for a
6:25:36
number of reasons. So at the end of the day, you're violating Google's advertising policies. So some of the
6:25:43
policies that could have been violated are, and just some of the many, we're just listing some here, prohibited
6:25:50
content, prohibited practices, restricted content, or editorial untechical. So, when you look at
6:25:56
prohibited content, I will say this, you're not going to be able to sell drugs. Even if you're selling
6:26:03
pharmaceutical products, that's considered drugs and that's going to be prohibited or prohibited practices like
6:26:10
selling drugs online. That's illegal in the state. So, you're going to definitely get flagged for that. Okay?
6:26:17
So, there are a lot of different ways in which your ads can be disapproved. Okay?
6:26:22
But if you do see restricted content then that means you can advertise but
6:26:28
with limitations and usually those limitations are restricted to say only Google search and not Google search
6:26:35
partners or to a specific geography. So, usually the key here is if somebody asks
6:26:40
this question, okay, there are a lot of different reasons. Google's usually going to provide the specific or the
6:26:47
reason why it got disapproved and they're usually going to include a link that you can refer to. Okay? So, at
6:26:54
least Google does that much. They're not going to leave you in the dark and tell you your ad's just been disapproved.
6:26:59
They're going to tell you why and include a link that you can go to figure out how you can best resolve the
6:27:06
disapproved ad. So what are the different kinds of bidding available in Google ads? So we already covered part
6:27:12
of this earlier on. So remember Google search network is only cost per click
6:27:18
CPC. When we talk about Google's display network, you have three options. Cost
6:27:23
per click, cost per view and cost per impression. And CPM is cost per 1,000
6:27:30
impressions. So, you're paying per 1,000 impressions. Impression is when somebody
6:27:35
actually sees your ad. Cost per view is actually somebody looking at your ad for
6:27:41
at least 30 seconds or the entirety of the ad. So, if the ad video ad only runs
6:27:47
15 seconds and somebody watched the entirety, then you're going to pay per cost per view. So if your video is two
6:27:55
minutes long and somebody watched 30 seconds, you're going to pay cost per view. Okay. So again, let's go through
6:28:00
these. Cost per click. It just enables you to set up a maximum price on the cost of somebody clicking on your
6:28:06
advertisement. You only pay when somebody clicks on your ad. Okay. Cost per view. Again, this is the default
6:28:13
method to set the price you'll pay for your video ads. Okay. you only pay when a viewer watches your video
6:28:20
advertisement for at least 30 seconds. And then cost per 1,000 impressions. So
6:28:26
this is the amount you pay each time your ad is displayed in the search network. And you pay for impressions
6:28:32
that are in generated for your ad. And you're paying for every 1,000 impressions. So the M is actually the
6:28:39
nor uh Roman numeral for 10,000. So that's where the M part comes in. So you're paying for 1,000 impressions. So
6:28:47
every 1,000 eyeballs, you're going to pay a price. And so cost per impression is good for brand awareness. If you're
6:28:54
trying to generate a lot of eyeballs onto your brand, then you'd want to go with a CPM model. Okay, so question 18.
6:29:01
What are some automatic bidding strategies? So let's define automatic bidding strategy. Automatic bidding
6:29:07
allows Google take over. Okay, not you. Google's taking over and they're the one
6:29:13
setting the bid amounts automatically. And it's going to be based on criteria and some of and that criteria is going
6:29:20
to be centered around conversions. So if Google bids on your behalf automatically, basically what they're
6:29:26
doing is they're collecting data on the behavior of your ads. And so if your ad is likely to get the click or
6:29:32
conversion, then Google's going to set the bid amount so you can win that auction in order to get the click or the
6:29:39
conversion. So there are different types of bidding strategies, but remember you
6:29:44
have to align a bidding strategy with the strategy of the campaign. So for example, if your goal of the campaign is
6:29:51
to increase site visitors, you just want people to click on your ad and go to your website, then you're going to have
6:29:57
an automated bidding strategy of maximize clicks that aligns with your campaign strategy. So, this strategy
6:30:04
automatically sets your bids to help to get as many clicks as possible within
6:30:09
your budget. So, Google's going to do its best based on historical performance of the campaign to generate traffic to
6:30:16
your site. That's the goal. That's the biz strategy. Okay, let's take a look at some others. So, hey, the goal of our
6:30:23
strategy campaign is to increase visibility. So, that's an easy one. Remember cost per impressions. Hey, we
6:30:29
want to maximize how many people look at our ads. Okay, so target impression
6:30:35
share. So this bidding strategy allows your bids to show at the top of the
6:30:40
page. Okay, so you're getting the impression so people are able to look at your ad. Okay, so you're telling Google,
6:30:45
hey, I want to be shown at least 50% of the time when somebody types in a keyword that I'm bidding on. So they're
6:30:53
going to make sure that they meet your target impression share of 50%. So, they're going to set your bids
6:30:59
automatically to make sure your ad shows at the top of the page so it's seen at
6:31:04
least 50% of the time. That's the goal of the campaign and that's the bidding strategy goal. We set up a campaign to
6:31:11
drive conversions. So, there are a couple of bidding strategies against conversions. So, target CPA. So, this
6:31:17
strategy sets a search or display bid to get as many conversions as possible. But
6:31:22
there's a caveat here. Cost per acquisition is what CPA stands for. So,
6:31:27
we're trying to get as many conversions as possible, but at a certain cost. For example, if I'm selling t-shirts for
6:31:35
$10, do I want to pay $20 CPA for every
6:31:41
sale? Do I want to pay Google $20? No. I'd be losing money. I'd be out of business. Okay. So, if I'm selling
6:31:47
t-shirts for $10 on my website, I'm probably going to put the CPA about $2 or $3 again, depending on my cost of
6:31:53
goods. So, if I factor in my cost of goods, I'm trying to make a profit. Then, I'm going to tell Google, look,
6:31:59
I'm trying to get some sales, but I don't want to lose money getting the sales. So, you're going to put in a threshold, and that threshold is your
6:32:05
target CPA. And so Google's going to automatically bid and win the auction
6:32:11
for keywords when they feel those keywords can get you a target CPA that
6:32:16
you put in. For example, $2. Okay. So, the goal of our campaign is to meet a
6:32:22
target return on ad spend, meaning return on advertising spend, meaning we're getting more revenue than we're
6:32:28
spending. That ratio needs to be positive. So Google's going to help us again adjust our bids to make sure that
6:32:36
our return on advertising spend meets our criteria. So we could put a ro at
6:32:43
100% 200% etc. And Google's going to adjust our bids accordingly based on the
6:32:49
keyword that they think will meet that criteria of 100% or 200%. So that's
6:32:55
target return on advertising spend. And that's there to see if Google can help you generate a profit. So we have
6:33:02
another campaign set up. We're trying to get more conversions. We have a budget. We want to spend the budget, but we we
6:33:08
want to get conversions. So this is a gimme. The bidding strategy here would be maximize conversions. So this
6:33:13
strategy sets bids like all the others. It automatically is going to adjust your
6:33:18
bid. That is Google. It's going to adjust the bid to help you win the auction based on historical performance.
6:33:26
So, if a keyword in historically has performed in terms of conversions, you
6:33:31
better believe Google's going to try and win the auction on your behalf to get the click to get that conversion. And
6:33:37
that's maximize conversions. Okay, moving on. Question 19. And this is probably the most important question
6:33:45
that you're going to get if an interviewer asks you this question. This is what Google ads is all about. Quality
6:33:51
score. So what is quality score? So simply put, quality score is a score between 1 and 10 given to every keyword
6:33:58
you bid on. And basically between 1 and 10, it's bas Google's giving you the score, the quality score of that
6:34:05
keyword. And so how does Google come up with that score between 1 and 10? Well,
6:34:10
there's three main factors here. One is expected clickthrough rate. The second is ad relevance. And the third is
6:34:16
landing page experience. So obviously a higher quality score the better off you are. Okay, a low quality score it's not
6:34:23
going to bode well for you. And so if you have a low quality score, Google actually will tell you which of these
6:34:30
three components you're not scoring very well on. So you're either going to get a below average, average, or above average
6:34:37
for each of these three components that make up quality score. And I will tell you this, if I were to divide them up in
6:34:44
two/ thirds, clickthrough rate, expected clickthrough rate is more important than the other two. So that's about twothirds
6:34:51
of quality score. And expected clickthrough rate is basically Google saying look, other advertisers have bid
6:34:56
on this keyword and their clickthrough rate has been historically around say for example 3%. So if you can't get 3%
6:35:05
then your quality score is going to suffer. Ad relevance is simply does the ad or is the ad relevant to the keyword
6:35:11
you're bidding on. Likewise for the landing page, but the landing page experience is a little bit more subjective because the landing page has
6:35:17
to load well fast, no popups, no a lot of external links, nothing spammy, no
6:35:25
ads being served up. So, a lot of factors in landing page experience. Google wants to make sure somebody
6:35:31
clicks on your ad that they're going to have a good experience when they land on that page. And so quality score is so
6:35:37
key here. It is very key because if you don't have a good quality score, the repercussion means you're going to have
6:35:44
to bid higher because quality score times bid equals ad rank. So for every
6:35:52
auction, whoever has the highest ad rank is going to be at the top of Google search results. So if you have a low
6:35:58
quality score, let's just say one, and you're bidding $4 on that keyword, then
6:36:03
your ad rank is four. 1* four is four. So you got to keep that in mind because
6:36:09
other advertisers could have a higher ad rank or better quality scores for that keyword. So again, expected clickthrough
6:36:17
rate. This just shows how likely it is that your ads will get clicked when shown for a particular keyword. Google
6:36:23
expects a certain number here. You should always try to achieve the highest
6:36:28
clickthrough rate possible. And click the rate is simply how many times your ad was seen versus how many times it was
6:36:34
clicked. That's all clickthrough rate is clicks divided by impressions. So you should always try to achieve the highest
6:36:41
click-through rate possible. That will avoid getting a low quality score. Ad
6:36:46
relevance. So ad relevance simply means how relevant is your keyword to the ad.
6:36:51
Okay? So, if you're bidding on red Adidas running shoes, then make sure your ad discusses and mentions multiple
6:36:59
times naturally red Adidas running shoes. Okay? And remember, with those text ads, you have three headlines. You
6:37:06
have two description lines of up to 90 characters. You have side extensions. Okay? You have path one and path two.
6:37:14
That meaning you can add additional keywords to the end of a URL. So you have lots of opportunities to make sure
6:37:21
the ad is relevant to the keyword. And then landing page experience. Again, this is a little subjective, but hey,
6:37:28
Google's going to use landing page experience to estimate how relevant and useful your website's landing page will
6:37:33
be to people who not only click on your web, but land on that page. So, does that page load fast? Does it have any
6:37:40
unnecessary popups? Does it does it have some quirky external links that look
6:37:46
spammy? Okay, you got to take all these things into consideration and think about the end user here. Then last
6:37:51
question for search engine marketing. So what are the hallmarks of a good PPC landing page? So going back to landing
6:37:57
page experience, this is a good segue. So you always want to make sure you have an attractive and powerful headline on
6:38:04
the page. Remember, it's got to be a nice flow. You're bidding on a keyword. Somebody types in the keyword. They see
6:38:10
your attractive ad. They click on that attractive ad which has the keyword in it. They click on the ad. they go to
6:38:16
landing page, they want to be able to see something very similar to what they typed in the ad they saw. They want to
6:38:22
be able to see it seamlessly on the landing page. And so that attractive and powerful headline should include that
6:38:28
keyword. Should also have persuasive copy that can convince prospects to
6:38:33
convert. To me, bullet points always work here. Simple bullet points, easy to read, easy to understand, easy to just
6:38:41
convey the positives about what you're trying to sell or convert. Have engaging media like videos. Videos always help
6:38:48
because they're interactive. It keeps people engaged longer. Or have some really good images. Don't just go stock
6:38:54
photography. You know, complement the video with some images. And then your landing pages should have enough white
6:38:59
space to draw attention to specific elements on the page. And meaning don't cram the page together because remember
6:39:06
users are also coming to these pages via mobile. So you got to take that in consideration as well. So cramming your
6:39:13
pages full of content, videos, and images is probably not going to bode well. So make sure there's breathing
6:39:19
room for people to read, understand, and react. And those are hallmarks of a good
6:39:24
PPC landing page. Some other factors here, adding trust indicators like you
6:39:30
some statistical evidence, meaning how many people downloaded your app. You can always have testimonials, you know,
6:39:36
third-party sales of approval like Better Business Bureau, you know, privacy policy links, help. Okay, so you
6:39:44
want to add some things in there that's going to, you know, give you credibility. Having a properly designed
6:39:50
lead capture form to collect visitors information is always helpful. If you're trying to get that conversion, then have
6:39:56
a lead form. Make it simple. Don't have a lead form with 20 forms or fields. You
6:40:01
know, have a simple name, email address, make the phone number optional, and have one field that they can type in specific
6:40:08
information. And then last, but certainly not least, have a good call to action. So, make sure that call to
6:40:14
action aligns with what you're trying to do. Again, selling those red Adidas
6:40:20
running shoes. If they're on sale, then you know, make sure the call to action
6:40:26
aligns with that sale. You can always say, you know, 20% off for the next two
6:40:32
days or, you know, $10 off if you purchase today. So, have some good
6:40:38
strong call to action. That's a wrap on a full course, guys. If you have any doubts or question, ask them in the

hey everyone my name is sam oh and welcome to the seo fundamentals course by ahrefs in this course i'll be
0:05
teaching you the fundamentals of seo with a heavy focus on execution and while it's a beginner's seo course i
0:12
don't want you to be fooled by the word beginner even for an eight-figure business like ours we don't do anything
0:18
crazy technical or complicated right from the start we've stuck with the fundamentals of seo that led to
0:25
compounded growth and today our site gets over a million monthly visits from google search alone making seo one of
0:32
our most effective strategies to get traffic to our site so the course is broken down into four modules plus this
0:39
video which is more of an introduction to the course as well as in seo 101 in this video we'll go over the basics of
0:46
seo and cover things like what it is why it's important and how it works you'll
0:51
then move on to module one which is on keyword research throughout these lessons i'll show you how to find
0:56
keywords to target that can benefit your business it'll also set the foundation for the next module which is on-page seo
1:03
in this module we'll talk about optimizing your pages to rank for those keywords the next module will be on link
1:10
building this is one of google's most prominent ranking signals which has proven to contribute to higher rankings
1:16
in search finally we'll finish off the course with the basics of technical seo which will mostly be about best practices and
1:23
website maintenance all right let's kick things off with the seo basics we'll talk about what search
What is SEO and why it is important
1:28
engine optimization is why it's important and how google works seo stands for search engine
1:35
optimization and it's the process of optimizing content to be discovered through a search engine's organic search
1:41
results now let's talk a bit about how they work if you're completely new to seo then it's easiest to think of search
1:47
engines as libraries but instead of storing books they store copies of websites and web pages
1:54
so when you search for a query the search engine will then look through all pages in its index and try to return the
2:00
most relevant results and seo helps demonstrate to search engines that your page is that result
2:07
now you might be thinking why should i focus on seo when there are so many other marketing mediums well
2:13
there are three major things that attract marketers to search engine optimization and in my opinion these
2:19
three things make seo the best traffic source number one unlike paying for ads
2:24
search traffic is free number two organic traffic is typically consistent
2:29
once you're ranking high whereas other mediums like social media and email marketing often result in traffic spikes
2:36
that usually end up fading to nothing and it makes sense because social media networks are designed to surface fresh
2:42
content emails often get marked as read forgotten or land in the spam box whereas search traffic is a result of
2:49
users actively searching for information and the number of searches for a given topic is typically consistent month to
2:56
month and number three you have the opportunity to reach massive audiences you wouldn't have access to otherwise in
3:03
fact as of october 2019 there were nearly 4.39 billion internet users
3:09
around the world and almost 4 billion of those people are google users this is why search engine optimization
3:15
is an 80 billion dollar industry and why marketers from all walks of life are
3:20
adopting and pursuing it today everyone wants their business to get discovered and seo is the perfect way to do that
3:28
now let's briefly talk about how google works and there are two parts to this the first is crawling and indexation and
3:34
these two things are what actually allows google to discover web pages and create their search index so to actually
3:41
attain information google uses crawlers also known as spiders which gather publicly available information from all
3:49
over the web the spiders will start crawling from a list of known urls called seeds
3:54
then they follow the hyperlinks on those pages and crawl those newly discovered pages and this process goes on and on
4:02
allowing them to collect a ton of information they then take all of this data back to google servers to be added
4:08
to their search index and that's what people like you and i are searching through when we key in a query in google
4:15
now if you were to search for something and google returned every result that mentioned your words on the page then
4:20
you'd end up with really bad results this brings us to the second part which is google's ranking algorithm
4:27
google has hundreds of ranking signals and they make tweaks to their algorithm 500 to 600 times per year so to be frank
4:35
no one knows exactly how their algorithm works but they've given us clues and some
4:40
guidelines to better
4:55
are just speculation at best but i do want to cover a few of the most important factors that you'll need to
5:00
understand from a fundamental standpoint first are backlinks backlinks are links
5:06
from a page on one website to another and google has said on their house search works page that if other
5:12
prominent websites link to a page that's proved to be a good sign that information is well trusted
5:19
the easiest way to understand the value of a backlink is to think of them as votes when a page receives a backlink
5:25
it's essentially another website vouching for the content on the page and the more votes you get from credible
5:31
sources the higher the trust and we also studied the effect of backlinks on search traffic and found a clear
5:38
positive correlation between backlinks from unique websites and a page's organic traffic
5:44
second is search intent which represents the reason behind a searches query and if you think of google's goal for search
5:50
their job is to return the most relevant results for any given query so with that
5:55
said you can discover search intent simply by looking at the top ranking pages for the query you want to rank for
6:02
for example if you search for slow cooker recipes you'll see that the search results are mostly blog posts
6:08
with a list of slow cooker recipes so if you try and rank a product page where you're selling a slow cooker you won't
6:15
be matching search intent and therefore you won't rank now if we change the query to just slow
6:20
cooker you'll see that the dominant types of pages are ecommerce category pages so if you try and rank your blog
6:27
post of slow cooker recipes then you probably won't rank because you're not matching search intent this is a
6:33
critical concept to understand and i'll share a simple three-point checklist you can use to determine search intent for
6:39
any query in the next module and third is content depth search engines are made
6:44
up of computer programs so they can't actually read and understand text like you and i would nevertheless google has
6:52
poured billions of dollars into creating sophisticated technology that understands content to a certain degree
6:59
but it's your job as a content creator to provide context about the subject for
7:04
example if you look at the top ranking pages for the quarry how to drive a car you'll find that they talk about things
7:10
like fastening your seatbelt familiarizing yourself with the gas and brake pedals adjusting your seat and
7:16
mirrors and other things that a first time driver may not know basically you want to be able to answer
7:22
the search's quarry the best that you possibly can and naturally it should lead to content that has depth
7:29
now it's important to note that depth doesn't always translate to length for example a topic like how to turn off
7:36
iphone 12 doesn't need to and shouldn't be long in fact the top ranking page is
7:41
only 185 words but the content itself solves the user's query from start to
7:47
finish alright so the basics are in the book and it's time to move on to the keyword research module
7:53
hey it's amo and welcome to the first module which is on keyword research in this first lesson we're going to talk
What are keywords
7:59
about what keywords are and how to choose them using a simple four point checklist let's get started so what are
8:06
keywords in the context of seo they're simply just words and phrases that people type into search engines to find
8:12
what they're looking for for example if you are shopping for running shoes you might search for
8:17
keywords like men's running shoes or simply just running shoes now keywords are actually super
8:23
important in seo because it sets the entire foundation for search engine optimization the basic goal of seo is to
8:30
rank your pages for keywords that your target audience or customers are searching for and if you're not ranking
8:36
for keywords that actually get searched then your seo efforts are kind of meaningless
8:42
for example we rank number one for the query seo checklist and this keyword is responsible for driving around 1500
8:49
monthly visitors from google and that's just in the us so keyword research is the process of
8:55
finding keywords that people are inputting into search engines and we'll get into this process in the upcoming
9:01
lessons so how do you actually choose keywords that are worth targeting let's run
9:06
through a checklist that should help you choose keywords effectively the first thing to check is if your
9:11
keyword has search demand search demand represents the volume of monthly searches made for a keyword and this is
9:17
measurable with a keyword metric that we call search volume you can find the search volume for a
9:22
keyword by using a keyword research tool like ahrefs keywords explorer for example the query kilometers to miles
9:30
gets searched around 478 000 times per month in the us alone but
9:35
as you can see here in hfs keywords explorer 80 of searches go without a click to a page and that's because
9:42
google has a handy calculator right here that'll solve the searcher's problem so search volume alone can actually be a
9:49
bit misleading which is why it's worth looking at the second checkpoint which is to check the traffic potential of the
9:55
topic traffic potential represents the total search traffic you could get if you were
10:00
to rank at the top of google for your keyword let's look at the stats for our seo checklist page in hf site explorer
10:07
so again we rank number one for the query seo checklist and it sends us approximately 1500 monthly search visits
10:15
from the us but if we look at the total global organic traffic to the page you'll see
10:20
that we get approximately 3 000 monthly visits from google every single month and that's because
10:26
this page ranks for over 200 keywords and this page isn't an outlier in our
10:31
study of three million keywords we found that on average the top ranking page ranks for nearly a thousand other
10:38
keywords in the top ten so while you may be optimizing your pages for a main keyword your page will
10:44
likely rank for hundreds or even thousands of other relevant keywords and because of that the monthly search
10:51
traffic potential of the topic seo checklist is actually higher than its monthly search volume
10:57
this is what makes traffic potential a much more reliable metric than search volume and the way you determine traffic
11:03
potential is by looking at how much traffic the top ranking pages are getting for example if we go to ahrefs keywords
11:10
explorer and search for submit website to search engines you'll see that it has a search volume of 1100 monthly searches
11:17
in the us now if i scroll to the bottom of the page you'll see a serp overview which
11:23
shows you the top 10 ranking pages for that keyword and serp just stands for search engine
11:28
results page and as you can see our page gets an estimated 5 300 monthly search visits
11:35
from the us alone and we rank for over 1300 keywords making traffic potential
11:41
of this keyword higher than its search volume now it doesn't always work out this way
11:47
for example the query keyword cannibalization has a search volume of 150 monthly searches but the traffic
11:54
potential is well under 100 so it becomes more of a business decision whether you want to tackle the topic or
12:00
not now choosing keywords based on metrics alone is not a good idea which
12:06
is why the rest of the checkpoints are meant to ground you the next point on our checklist is to
12:11
assess the business potential of the keyword or topic business potential simply represents the
12:16
value a keyword has to your business and value really comes down to your niche as
12:21
well as your business model so an easy way to do this is by assigning scores between one to three to keywords you're
12:28
researching the higher the number the more important the topic is to your business
12:33
so let's say you have a site about golf and the way you make money is by selling used golf clubs
12:39
bringing this back to business potential that means topics where you can organically recommend products to
12:44
visitors would hold the highest business value for example people searching for something like buy used golf clubs are
12:52
likely ready to make a purchase here and now so in my books this would have a
12:57
business value of three now a keyword like best golf clubs would also be relevant to your site people are
13:04
likely ready to make a purchase soon but just don't know which clubs to buy but it's actually quite easy to plug
13:10
your products because for the golf clubs you recommend you can easily link back to your product pages leading visitors
13:17
closer to making a purchase so i'd give this a business value of two now a keyword like what is a handicap in golf
13:24
would be really tough to organically recommend your products but nevertheless it's a way to attract relevant traffic
13:30
to your site so i'd give this a business value of one so these would hold the lowest priority and anything that has a
13:37
score of zero is probably worth ignoring because it's not going to impact your bottom line so something like happy
13:44
gilmore review would have a business value of zero because it has nothing to do with your business other than the
13:50
fact that it's a fantastic movie about golf alright the next point on this checklist is to see if you can match
13:56
searcher intent this is a concept that we covered in the first lesson of this course but it's something that i'm going
14:02
to keep talking about because it's super important so again search intent represents the reason behind a
14:08
searcher's query and the way we determine that is by looking at the top ranking pages for the keyword we want to
14:14
rank for for example let's say you have a recipes blog and you want to rank for toaster oven
14:20
looking at the top ranking pages you'll see that almost all of the pages are ecommerce category pages
14:27
this tells us that the intent of the searcher is likely to buy or at least to shop around for different toaster ovens
14:34
so unless you can actually satisfy the intent of the searcher it's unlikely that you'll be able to rank high for
14:40
this query and we'll dig deeper into search intent in the next lesson the final point on this checklist is to
14:45
determine whether you can rank for your keyword search volume traffic potential and business potential mean absolutely
14:52
nothing if you can't rank for your keyword in the not so distant future and
14:57
understanding the level of difficulty to rank for a given keyword takes a bit of analysis and practice
15:03
this is why i've created an entire lesson on assessing ranking difficulty because mastering this process will help
15:09
you get predictable results in seo so i'll save that for a later lesson now actually choosing keywords comes
15:16
down to finding a balance in this checklist you have to ask yourself does the topic drive enough traffic and have
15:22
business value to make it worth the effort and this is the question you should ask yourself before you create
15:28
pages with the intent to rank in search and these five points in the checklist are exactly what we're going to dive
15:35
deeper into throughout the rest of this module hey it's sam oh and welcome to the
How to analyze search intent
15:40
second lesson which is on search intent and i touched on this in the first lesson on seo basics but i really want
15:46
to take some time to unpack what it is and how to use it in keyword research
15:51
reason being if you can't match searcher intent then you probably aren't going to rank for your target keywords
15:58
so again search intent represents the reason behind a searcher's query and matching search intent is one of those
16:04
must do things to show search engines that your page will fulfill their goal to deliver the most relevant results for
16:12
any given query and while it might sound like you're trying to satisfy google what you're actually doing is learning
16:19
what you need to do to satisfy the searcher's intent identifying search intent is usually
16:25
quite easy all you have to do is search for the keyword you want to rank for and then analyze the top ranking results and
16:33
the top ranking results are a great proxy to understand search intent because google understands what
16:39
searchers want probably more than anyone else now analyzing is kind of a jargony word
16:45
but i have a simple three prong formula you can use it's called the three c's of search intent
16:51
the first c is content type content type can usually be categorized into blog posts videos product category
16:59
and landing pages for example the dominant type of pages for the quarry best golf shoes are blog
17:06
posts the second c is content format and this applies more to blog posts and landing
17:12
pages a few common blog formats you'll see are how to's step-by-step tutorials
17:19
list posts and opinion editorials for a landing page that might be something like a tool or calculator
17:26
again for the quarry best golf shoes you'll see that all of the top results are listicles which makes sense because
17:32
the word best implies that a comparison needs to be made and the third c is content angle which
17:39
often depicts the benefit it's basically your hook as to why someone should click and visit your page for best golf shoes
17:47
you'll see that every post has gone with a freshness angle which is evident based on the current year being in the titles
17:53
in my opinion this is the least important and often least consistent among top ranking pages
17:59
now this is just one example of search intent for a keyword let's go through a few more examples to really drill in
18:05
this concept the first example is for the query how to swing a golf club the dominant
18:11
content type is clearly blog posts but you'll also notice that a youtube video is ranking ahead of the blog post so
18:18
this tells us that it may be worth creating both a blog post and video to potentially get two different spots in
18:24
the search results as for content format they're clearly all how to's and seeing as the nature of
18:31
the topic would require a step-by-step procedure that's probably the route you'd want to go to and you can confirm
18:37
this by actually visiting some of the top ranking pages now with content angle it appears as
18:43
though for beginners or basic seems to be the right way to approach the topic
18:49
the second example is for the query golf clubs looking at the serp you'll see that they're all ecommerce category
18:55
pages which tells us that when people search for this query they're likely in shopping mode
19:00
now seeing as content format applies mostly to blog posts and landing pages it wouldn't be applicable here since
19:06
we're looking at ecommerce category pages as for content angle it seems to
19:12
be mostly about deals so saving money on golf clubs alright the final example is for
19:18
something like golf bags looking at the serp you'll see something a bit different we have a mixed serp
19:24
content type for the top ranking page is an ecommerce category page then we have a couple of blog posts on the best golf
19:31
bags and we also have an outlier on how to buy golf bags and towards the bottom half of the
19:37
results we have more ecommerce category pages so what do you do
19:43
well in order to make an educated decision we still need to lay some foundation work so we'll revisit this
19:48
example in a later lesson hey it's ammo and welcome to the third lesson in our keyword research module in
How to find keyword for your site
19:55
this lesson i'm going to show you how to find keywords for your website based on the things you learn in lesson one and
20:01
two of this module let's get started so keyword research is the process of finding keywords that people are
20:08
searching for in search engines and the general process can be divided into two macro steps step one is to generate
20:15
keyword ideas and step two is to validate whether those keywords are worth going after
20:21
now this lesson is mostly about step one generating keyword ideas for your website and in order to do that you need
20:28
a keyword research tool keyword research tools show you information on keywords like their
20:33
search volume keyword difficulty scores and other seo metrics plus they should
20:38
help you discover potential topics worth going after there are a lot of tools out there and you're free to use whichever
20:44
ones you want but for this course i'll be using ahrefs keywords explorer now i also understand that some people
20:50
may not be in a place to purchase seo software right now if that's you then we
20:55
also have a free tool called ahrefs keyword generator which is a good place to start i'll leave links to both tools
21:01
in the description all right so we're going to be doing some keyword research for the rest of this lesson so let's say that the
21:07
website we're doing keyword research for is a golf blog and the way this blog generates revenue is through affiliate
21:13
commissions meaning they promote other people's products and when someone clicks on one of the links and makes a
21:19
purchase you're compensated with a commission so the first step is to come up with a list of seed keywords and a seed keyword
21:27
is just a broad keyword related to your niche so i'll go to hfs keywords explorer and add a few seeds for our
21:34
golf site so that might be golf balls golf clubs and golf hats to name a few
21:40
next i'll go to the phrase match report which will show us keywords that include any of these phrases
21:46
and just like that we have around 125 000 keyword ideas with search volumes
21:52
and a ton of other helpful metrics some of which we'll touch on later now 125
21:57
000 keywords is just way too much to filter through so before we continue let's take a second and revisit the five
22:04
point checklist from the first lesson in this module again the five things we're looking for when it comes to choosing keywords are
22:11
one we want keywords that have search demand two keywords with traffic potential
22:18
three keywords with business potential four we need to be able to match search
22:23
intent and five we want to know how hard it will be to rank at the top of google
22:28
for that keyword so when we're generating keyword ideas we'll be able to check off the first
22:34
four points as for the fifth we'll tackle that in the next lesson alright let's look back at our list of
22:40
keyword ideas and start checking off some of these boxes so first we need to find keywords that
22:45
have search demand to do that you can set a search volume filter to show keywords with a minimum volume of at
22:52
least 300 monthly searches and now that list has just shrunk to 351
22:58
keyword ideas which will be easy to manually filter through the next point on this checklist is to
23:04
see if they have traffic potential again traffic potential is a more reliable
23:09
metric than search volume because not all searches result in clicks and at the end of the day we want traffic not
23:16
searches to check the traffic potential of a topic you need to look at the top ranking pages and see how much traffic
23:23
they're getting to do that you can click on the surf button beside any of these keywords
23:28
so if we do that for the quarry golf clubs you'll see that the top page gets around 16 000 monthly search visits from
23:35
the us now if you don't have an ahrefs account you can get a free version of the serp
23:40
using hf serp checker tool next up is business potential again
23:45
business potential is simply the value a keyword has to your business and while 16 000 monthly search visits seems great
23:52
you need to consider the fourth point on the checklist which is to ask yourself if you can match search intent
23:58
as you can see almost all of the top ranking pages are ecommerce category pages
24:04
so searchers are probably in shopping mode but we have a golf affiliate blog so the site probably isn't selling golf
24:11
clubs meaning we can't create an ecommerce category page and therefore we
24:16
won't be able to match search intent so seeing as this query doesn't fulfill the points on our checklist we wouldn't go
24:23
after this keyword now looking further down the list you'll see the quarry best golf balls it has a
24:29
high search volume and if i click on the search button you'll see that the traffic potential is around 5000 monthly
24:36
visits from the us pretty good now in terms of business potential this
24:41
keyword would have a value of 3 because our site makes money by reviewing and recommending products so it would be
24:48
super easy to organically recommend products in a best of post which i assume would lead to a fair amount of
24:54
affiliate commissions as for search intent these are blog posts in the listicle format with the
25:00
freshness content angle as you can see from the titles of the top ranking pages so this query checks all boxes and
25:07
passed our initial sniff test so i'll click on the check box and add it to my golf keyword list
25:15
now checking the serp for all of these keywords would be pretty time consuming so there's a quick technique you can use
25:21
to find relevant keywords and that's to use keyword modifiers a modifier is an add-on to a base
25:28
keyword for example if our base keyword is golf hats we can modify this keyword
25:33
by adding best top or the current year and modifiers tell us a lot about search
25:39
intent a word like best again tells us that a comparison needs to be made so
25:44
searchers are probably looking for listicle blog posts with various different product recommendations
25:51
now if a word like how or what is in the keyword then it tells us that the top pages will likely be blog posts or
25:57
videos with step-by-step tutorials or some other informational content
26:02
so with this knowledge we can actually filter this keyword list down to a
26:07
keywords that likely have business potential and b keywords where we can match searcher
26:13
intent for example since we're doing keyword research for an affiliate site modifiers
26:18
like best top versus and review would likely bring up topics where we can organically
26:25
recommend products so if we go back to the keyword list we can click on the include filter and
26:31
paste this list there next i'll hit the any word tab since we want to find keywords that include any
26:37
of these modifiers as well as one of our seed keywords hit apply and we now have a list of
26:44
around 30 keywords that are most likely going to have high business potential
26:49
plus we know that 99 of the time the results for any best type keyword will
26:54
be listicle blog posts and we know that we can match searcher intent with our affiliate blog
27:00
now if we switch the modifiers in the include filter to words like how what who
27:06
where why guide and tutorial then we can apply the list to find
27:12
informational topics that we could write about on our blog and pretty much all of these keywords
27:18
will be fair game for our hypothetical golf blog now if you plan to use a list of modifiers then it's worth noting that
27:24
you should probably do it with much broader seats for example you'll see that we only have
27:30
10 keywords when using the search volume filter paired with our list of informational modifiers
27:36
now if i change the c to just golf set the volume filter to a minimum of 300
27:41
monthly searches and then paste in my list of informational modifiers hit the any tab and click apply
27:49
then you'll see we have a lot more topics that we could potentially create content around so if this is a method
27:55
you want to try then take a screenshot of this list of modifiers and feel free to use them in your keyword research now
28:02
after doing keyword research for exactly 33 minutes and 14 seconds i was able to
28:07
compile a list of over 190 keyword ideas in my golf keyword list
28:13
now one downside to using keyword research tools is that the list of keyword ideas will usually be limited to
28:19
words and phrases that include your seats but there are other great keywords that won't necessarily include your
28:25
seeds so how do you find them well the best way to find these keywords is to look at pages that drive the most
28:32
search traffic to your competitor sites because if your competitors are ranking for keywords that are sending them a ton
28:39
of search traffic then i'm sure you'd want to get in on the action right now by competitor i'm not necessarily
28:45
talking about your direct business competitors i'm referring to your organic search competitors which are
28:51
websites that rank for keywords that you'd want to rank for so to find these competitors i'll go
28:57
back to ahrefs keywords explorer but this time i'll click on my golf keyword list
29:02
next i'll go to the traffic share by domains report which will show you the websites that get the most search
29:08
traffic based on your keyword input in this case our golf keyword list
29:13
so as you can see sites like golf digest golf.com and golf wrx are getting the
29:19
most search traffic from the keywords that i want to hypothetically rank for but we already know these keywords since
29:26
we created the list so what you can do is click on the caret beside a domain you want to research further and then
29:33
click top pages which will show you the pages that send the most search traffic to a website
29:39
and check this out golf digest page on game improvement irons gets around 5 400
29:44
monthly search visits from the us this page that ranks for what degree is
29:49
a sand wedge gets around 4 700 monthly search visits and we wouldn't have seen these in the keyword ideas report
29:56
because they don't contain our seeds so you can just skim through this list look for potential topics then go
30:03
through those four points in the checklist for keywords that are interesting to you add them to your keyword list and once you've exhausted a
30:10
website's top pages rinse and repeat for the other organic search competitors until you're
30:16
satisfied with your list and if you're still unhappy with your list you can try and find other seeds within this report
30:23
the two that stand out to me right away are sand wedge and fairway woods
30:28
so i'll go back to keywords explorer and type those into the search box and seeing as both of these are
30:33
different types of golf clubs you can add pitching wedge putter putting and so
30:39
on and so forth bottom line there should be no shortage of keyword ideas and you should be able
30:45
to use these two methods to build a solid list of topics to keep you busy for years
30:51
but here's the thing even if you've checked off these four boxes on the checklist there's still one left and it
30:57
won't matter if you don't rank for your keywords hey it's ammo and welcome to the fourth
What is ranking difficulty
31:03
lesson in our keyword research module today i'm going to show you how to determine ranking difficulty for a
31:08
keyword this will help you understand how hard it'll be to rank high in google for your target keywords let's get
31:15
started so when it comes to ranking in google you need to understand who you'll be up against before you target a keyword
31:22
otherwise you could be entering a battle you won't be able to win from an seo perspective competitors are
31:29
pages and websites that rank at the top of google for your target keywords so that means your competitors can be
31:35
different for every single keyword you target so there are three main things you'll want to consider before you decide to
31:41
pick a fight and those are search intent metrics of the top ranking pages and
31:46
websites and topical authority of the top ranking websites now as we go through these points we're
31:53
going to create a list of self-check questions which should help you make informed decisions in your keyboard
31:58
targeting also in order to see things like metrics of top ranking pages you need an seo tool since google won't show
32:05
you data on other pages so i'll be using ahrefs keywords explorer throughout this lesson
32:11
now if you don't have an ahrefs account you can use our free serp checker tool which will give you data on the top
32:17
three pages all right let's start with search intent the first thing you need to do is look at the serp and ask yourself do some of
32:24
the top ranking pages fail to closely match search intent to find this out you can go through the
32:30
three c's of search intent as we discussed in lesson two of this module and by the looks of it they're all
32:36
listicle blog posts using the freshness angle so they do match it
32:41
also pay close attention to the titles and urls of the ranking pages in general if the top pages include the
32:48
primary keyword or a variation of it in the title and or url they're likely
32:54
targeting that keyword for example all of the top ranking pages for the quarry
32:59
how to save money are exactly about that whereas a quarry like best convertible
33:05
car seats for small cars is a bit mixed as you can see some pages have gone
33:11
specifically with the angle for small cars as a result it's probably matching
33:17
searcher intent better than the more broad posts about the best convertible car seats for any car
33:23
this is a sign of weakness in the serp because it means there's probably a lack of rank-worthy content out there about
33:30
the best convertible car seats for small cars now i don't want you to take this as
33:35
advice that you must include the exact keyword phrase in your titles and or
33:40
urls with this example finding convertible car seats for small cars is
33:46
actually a very specific need for a specific person all right let's talk about the metrics
33:52
the first metric to look at is the number of websites that are linking to the page at ahrefs we call this
33:58
referring domains as i mentioned in module 1 backlinks are one of google's most prominent ranking
34:05
signals so if a page has a lot of quality links pointing at it then it'll be more competitive to rank
34:12
so before choosing a keyword you need to ask yourself can i get more quality backlinks than
34:18
the top ranking pages the second metric is website authority at ahrefs we call this domain rating
34:25
which represents the overall strength of a website's backlink profile very generally speaking you should be
34:31
going after keywords where your website's dr is in a similar ballpark range as the top ranking pages or at the
34:38
very least one of the top ranking pages should be in the same range as your website
34:43
for example if all of the websites that rank in the top 10 have high dr's and
34:49
you have a dr of let's say 10 then you may want to consider competing when you're at a similar level so let's add
34:56
that question to our checklist is my website in a similar dr range or higher than the top ranking websites
35:04
again this is a very general recommendation but still a decent one to follow if you're a beginner to seo
35:11
to see the domain rating of your own site you can enter your domain in site explorer and see it here on the overview
35:17
page or you can enter your domain in our free website authority checker i'll be leaving links to all of these tools in
35:24
the description alright let's move on to the third part which is topical authority of the top
35:29
ranking websites google wants to rank pages from authoritative sources and this goes
35:35
beyond backlinks for example if we look at the serp 4 how to unclog a toilet you'll see that this
35:42
dr42 site is outranking much more powerful websites with significantly
35:48
more referring domains well this page comes from a website that's just about plumbing so it's
35:54
likely more authoritative on the topic so the question you need to ask yourself is
35:59
is my website equally or more topically authoritative than the top ranking
36:04
websites if the answer is yes then that's a positive thing for you
36:09
the easiest and quickest way to find out is to just look at the domain names and use some common sense for example
36:16
looking at the serp 4 best convertible car seat for small cars you'll see sites like experienced mommy baby center
36:24
parenting pod baby list and other relevant sites that talk about products
36:29
for children and for domains that aren't as easily distinguishable like 800 buckleup.org
36:36
you can just visit the site hit the about page and get a general idea of what the site is about in this case
36:43
you'll see that they talk about car seat recalls and review car seat brands so
36:48
yes it is topically authoritative on car seats all right let's look at our full list of
36:53
yes or no questions as a very general rule of thumb the more yeses you can check off the better your
37:00
chances of ranking again very general because seo is quite nuanced with that said let's go through
37:07
a couple of hypothetical examples for our golf site to set the scene let's say you have a website that's about golf
37:13
instruction and you also review golf equipment and your website's domain rating is low at around 15.
37:20
all right so the first example is for the quarry best golf grips let's start with the first question
37:26
do some of the top ranking pages fail to closely match search intent from the looks of it they all look
37:32
decent so i'll check the no box next up can i get more quality backlinks than
37:38
the top ranking pages again we haven't covered anything about quality backlinks yet so for now let's
37:45
just look at quantity most of the sites have very few referring domains so i'd say this is a
37:50
yes next question is my website in a similar dr range or higher than the top ranking
37:57
websites based on the serp there are a few sites with similar website authority so let's
38:03
give this a yes as well and finally is my website equally or
38:08
more topically authoritative than the top ranking websites well all of the top pages are from golf
38:14
sites and so is mine so let's give this a yes as well so based on our analysis
38:20
it looks like this would be a topic worth going after all right the next analysis is for the keyword best putters
38:27
looking at search intent overall it looks like the majority of pages are good so i'll check the no box but i do
38:34
want to touch on this page on the best blade putters this is more of a focused post and
38:40
they're likely ranking high for this because of all of the other factors like high website authority lots of referring
38:46
domains and topical authority so i would actually exclude them from the rest of this analysis
38:53
alright next up can i get more quality backlinks than the top ranking pages
38:59
again just looking at the quantity of links to these pages the answer would likely be a yes seeing as we're still
39:05
looking at about a dozen referring domains but it's important to realize that getting more links than the number
39:12
one page probably won't happen in the near future meaning getting the top ranking spot will be tough
39:19
next is my website in a similar dr range or higher than the top ranking websites
39:25
the answer is no and finally my website is topically authoritative so i'll give this a yes
39:33
now it looks like we're at a tie between yeses and notes and this is exactly why i said
39:39
as a very general rule of thumb the more yeses you can check off the better your
39:44
chances of ranking again seo is nuanced plus you need to weigh out some of the other principles
39:51
we discussed like traffic potential and business value and the best way to make sound judgment
39:57
calls is through experience so it will take time to hone your skills
40:02
and gain a better grasp of keyword analysis so as you can see understanding how hard
40:08
it will be to rank in google will be a key skill to your success in search why
40:14
because it's the first step to getting predictable results after all if you know what it'll take to
40:20
rank ahead of your competition then it all comes down to execution and that's what the next two modules are
40:26
all about hey it's ammo and welcome to the second module which is about on-page seo if you
What is on-page SEO
40:33
haven't seen the introduction to seo video and the module on keyword research then i highly recommend watching those
40:39
first they'll help you get the foundational knowledge you'll need to get the most out of this module i'll
40:44
leave links in the description all right so what is on-page seo it's simply the practice of optimizing web
40:51
pages to rank higher in search engines and it revolves heavily around optimizing pages for search intent but
40:58
on-page optimizations also involve creating and optimizing html tags like
41:04
titles and meta descriptions now if you've been exposed to the practice of on-page seo then it's quite
41:10
likely that you've heard conflicting advice and for that reason we're going to discuss both what on-page seo is and
41:18
what it is not let's talk about common advice you might see on on-page seo best practices which
41:24
just aren't true today and while there are many old school tactics that are still being recommended i want to focus
41:31
on just three points to help you navigate the noise number one on-page seo is not about
41:38
stuffing exact match keywords it used to be common practice to include the exact keyword you wanted to rank for
41:45
in your title url and content for example if you wanted to rank for
41:50
car dealer san diego you would stuff that keyword throughout your page despite the fact it doesn't make sense
41:57
grammatically speaking google is smart enough to understand things like connecting words synonyms
42:03
and closely related words and phrases in fact for all of these queries the top
42:09
10 pages are nearly identical unfortunately stuffing exact match
42:14
keywords is still being practiced today which can lead to poor user experience
42:19
and poor readability all things that on-page seo should not do
42:25
the second thing is that on-page seo is not about using your keyword a specific
42:30
number of times on the page in our study of three million search queries we found that on average the top
42:36
ranking page ranks for around a thousand other relevant keywords in the top ten
42:42
now can you imagine what it would be like if a top ranking page had to mention all 1000 of those keywords at
42:48
least three times it makes no sense the content would be unnecessarily lengthy and create an
42:55
awful user experience for visitors here's an example look at the syrup for the quarry diet plan you'll see that
43:02
health lines article on how to lose weight ranks number one and there's no mention of a diet plan in their title or
43:08
url in fact there's only one fleeting mention of it on the page not even a subheading here's another example gq
43:16
ranks in the top spot for classiest watch but if we look at the page you'll see
43:21
that the word classiest isn't there and neither is the word classy
43:27
the third point is that on-page seo isn't about meeting a minimum word count
43:32
some studies have shown that the average content length of the top 10 results is over 2 000 words as a result many seos
43:40
have recommended that you create pages that are at least that length but that isn't exactly sound advice for
43:47
example our backlink checker is 628 words yet we rank number one for our target keyword and the page generates
43:55
around 130 000 monthly visits from google search alone
44:00
here's another example this page only has 76 words on it the majority of content are images according to hf site
44:07
explorer the page gets over 170 000 monthly search visits
44:13
now let's talk about what on-page seo is today in 2021 and beyond looking at the
44:18
definition again on-page seo is the practice of optimizing web pages to rank
44:23
higher in search engines and as i mentioned this revolves heavily around optimizing pages for search intent the
44:30
key word here is search intent translation the goal of your pages
44:35
should be to satisfy the searcher's intent how well we talked about the three c's of
44:41
search intent which should help you get the basic stuff down like the content type format and angle in addition to
44:48
this your content needs to address the things people expect to see you'll also want to nail the more
44:53
tangible items like titles subheadings internal linking readability and of
44:59
course the actual content itself these are the things we'll be answering in part two of our on-page seo module
45:06
where we'll get more tactical and talk about how you can create content that's optimized for search
45:13
hey it's ammo and welcome to the second lesson in the on-page seo module today i'm going to show you how to create a
45:19
page that's optimized for search let's get started so as i showed you in the last lesson on average the top ranking
45:26
page ranks for nearly a thousand keywords for example healthline's page is clearly targeting the query how to
45:33
lose weight fast and sure enough they're ranking in the top spot now the traffic to this page doesn't
45:39
come from just their target keyword it comes from the combined effect of ranking for thousands of queries and
45:46
when we sum up the traffic from all keywords it makes up well over a hundred thousand monthly search visits just from
45:53
the us in fact if we look at the page's keyword rankings you'll see that the target
45:58
query how to lose weight fast only sends them a small percentage of the total
46:03
monthly search traffic now in order to rank for a ton of keywords and get a ton of search traffic
46:09
you need two things the first is a page that's optimized to rank and the second
46:14
are backlinks in this lesson we'll cover how to create an optimized page and we'll tackle links in the next module
46:21
okay so with on-page seo there are two main things we need to cover the first is arguably the most important and
How to optimize a page for a target keyword
46:27
that's to ensure your page satisfies searcher intent we've already covered the three css search intent which again
46:34
will give you very basic guidance on the type of content to create the format to use and the angle to go with but the
46:41
actual content itself is what will leave your visitors satisfied or dissatisfied
46:48
so you might be wondering what exactly do i write about in order to satisfy searchers the short answer is to learn
46:55
from your competitors the top ranking pages are ranking at the top for a reason google and other search
47:01
engines deem them as the best candidates to satisfy a search's query so they're
47:06
clearly doing something right at least from the perspective of a search engine now while the content will vary from
47:12
topic to topic the way you research a competitor's content will be more or less the same let's go through an
47:18
example so let's say that we want to create content that targets the quarry best golf club sets
47:24
to start i'll go to ahrefs keywords explorer and search for the quarry then i'll scroll down to the serp
47:30
overview to see the top ranking pages now if you don't have an ahrefs account you can use our free serp checker tool
47:36
to do everything i'm about to do all right so looking at the serp we want to pick out the top three or so relevant
47:43
ranking results and by relevant i'm talking about pages that match the dominant search intent
47:49
based on the three cs we've discussed so many times now so in this case the
47:54
majority of pages are blog posts in the listicle format with freshness as the content angle so that means we wouldn't
48:01
look at pages from amazon or golf galaxy because these pages are clearly ecommerce category pages and are
48:08
therefore outliers to the dominant search intent we'll also exclude the pages from golf digest and business
48:14
insider since it doesn't look like they're intentionally targeting our query so i'll open up these three pages
48:20
in new tabs and what we're going to look for are similarities in their content specifically in the subtopics and we'll
48:28
also look to deepen our understanding of content format and content angle
48:33
looking at the first page you'll see that they've created a list of categories for the best golf club sets
48:39
so there's best selling best game improving irons and so on looking further down they have a
48:45
subheading which is the make and model of the golf club set followed by a brief review of the clubs
48:51
the next page also has a summary based on more broad categories like best value
48:57
premium pick and best choice and based on the table of contents you'll see that they followed a similar
49:03
structure where the make and model of the clubs are used as subheadings they also add a brief description of the
49:09
clubs as well as some skimmable bullet points and the final page does pretty much the
49:14
same thing they use subheadings as the make and model followed by a short review
49:19
now unless you're a golfer you may not have caught this minor but perhaps important detail
49:25
all the pages talk about sets that would appeal more to beginners for example they all talk about callaway strata set
49:33
and they all include sets from wilson's staff in my opinion these wouldn't appeal to
49:38
an intermediate or advanced level golfer alright so at this point we know that we
49:44
should create a holistical blog post with freshness as the angle we also know that the content should likely be
49:49
targeted at beginners a couple common sets that were mentioned in all posts were the callaway stratas as well as a
49:56
set from wilson's staff now it's important to note that you don't have to include these in your post but it's
50:02
simply an observation i had made we also saw that the top two out of three pages had top picks for categories like best
50:10
game improvement clubs as well as best clubs for the money finally we know that the subheading
50:16
should be the name of the club set another thing i recommend before you start writing is to do a content gap
50:22
analysis at the page level a content gap analysis at the page level will show you
50:27
common keywords that the top pages are ranking for where your page isn't but
50:32
since we don't have a page we can still find common keyword rankings amongst a few top ranking pages using ahrefs
50:40
content gaap tool to get started go to hr site explorer and paste in any one of the urls
50:47
next head on over to the content gap tool now i'm going to take the three urls we
50:52
analyzed and put them all in the top section of this tool so what this is saying is show us
50:59
keywords that any of these targets rank for where at least one of them ranks in
51:04
the top 10. now if i run the search you'll be able to see the keywords that these pages rank for in the position that they're
51:11
ranking it as a general rule of thumb the more urls that rank high for the keywords the more
51:17
relevant it'll be to your content so to narrow our search down a bit i'll click on the intersections drop down and
51:24
select both two and three intersections meaning only show me keywords where at
51:29
least two of our targets are ranking in google and at least one of those targets
51:34
is ranking in the top 10. from here just skim through the list and look for interesting subtopics that
51:41
might be worth adding to your post in addition you may be able to learn some interesting things about the
51:47
audience as well as the language they use so as you can see people who search for this quarry are mostly looking for
51:53
men's clubs people want to know the best clubs for the money they want to see cheaper options and others are looking
52:00
specifically for a set of irons these are all things you should consider as you craft your content
52:07
all right so armed with this information you should be able to create a great post with a searcher in mind and while
52:13
the content is the most important part there are also a few more technical on-page optimizations you should do
52:20
let's go through a few of the most important ones first is to include your target keyword in your title when it makes sense
52:28
adding your target keyword to your title should come naturally for example our title for this post is 45 best free seo
52:36
tools tried and tested and free seo tools is our target keyword
52:42
now there will be times when it makes more sense to use a close variant of your target keyword for example this
52:49
post is targeting the query how to get youtube subscribers but our title is
52:54
9 ways to get more youtube subscribers because we went for the listicle angle
52:59
the next thing you can do is to use a short and descriptive url slug short and descriptive urls help people
53:06
immediately understand what the page is about before even visiting them just
53:11
look at these two urls they're on the exact same topic but one is much more
53:17
descriptive than the other this part of the url is called the slug and the easiest way to choose your slug
53:23
is to use your target keyword where spaces will be replaced with hyphens again you should only do this when it
53:29
makes sense so you don't need to worry about forcing it now if you're wondering if you should use subfolders to describe
53:36
categories that's entirely up to you alright next is the meta description the
53:41
meta description is html code that's meant to briefly summarize your page and search engines often use this text right
53:48
within the serp to my best knowledge meta descriptions aren't used as a ranking signal but they can influence
53:55
click-through rates and for that reason i think it's important to add to your pages
54:01
now it's important to note that according to our study of 192 000 pages we found that google rewrote meta
54:07
descriptions nearly 63 percent of the time so i wouldn't spend a ton of time
54:12
on them but you should still include them alright next up is to add internal links to and from your pages
54:20
internal links are links from one page on the same domain to another and they're super powerful because they
54:26
can pass link authority to other relevant pages and they also help search engines better understand a page's
54:33
contents for example if i had a site in the careers niche and i was writing a post
54:38
about how to write a cover letter then i definitely want to add internal links from other relevant pages like one on
54:45
how to write a resume more importantly visitors who want to learn how to write a resume would
54:51
probably want to know how to write a cover letter and vice versa to find opportunities you can go to
54:58
google and search for sitecolon yourdomain.com and then add the topic you're writing
55:04
about then visit relevant pages and see if there's an opportunity to add an
55:09
internal link to your new post alternatively you can use ahrefs site audit tool completely free just sign up
55:16
for an ahrefs webmaster tools account verify your site and then run a crawl
55:21
then you can head over to link explorer to find internal linking opportunities we have a short but helpful video on how
55:28
to do this on ahrefs product updates youtube channel so i'll link that video up in the description
55:34
all right next up is to optimize your images in the last 28 days we've had over 4 000
55:40
visits to our blog from google image search while that pales in comparison to our
55:45
500 000 monthly organic blog visits it's still four thousand visits
55:51
now optimizing your images for seo is three-fold number one name your image
55:56
files appropriately for example this is a picture of a puppy if you took the photo yourself then
56:03
chances are your smartphone or camera named it something like img underscore
56:08
and then a million numbers instead change the file name to something like puppy
56:14
not exactly rocket science but according to google file names can give google clues about the subject matter of the
56:21
image number two use descriptive alt text alt text short for alternative text is
56:29
an html attribute that goes in your image tag so the syntax would look something like
56:34
this where the alt value should describe the image alt text helps improve accessibility for
56:40
those who are using screen readers or if the image fails to load visitors will be shown the alt text instead
56:46
now google recommends creating useful information rich content that uses keywords appropriately and is in context
56:54
of the content of the page yes google explicitly says to use keywords but they also say to avoid
57:01
stuffing keywords as it results in a negative user experience and may cause your site to be seen as spam meaning
57:08
don't do something like this now looking back at the syntax our alt text isn't exactly descriptive so let's
57:15
change that to something like puppy sitting on a couch if you use wordpress just add your alt
57:21
text here when inserting your images and the cms should do the rest alright the
57:26
third thing you'll want to do is compress your images compressing images makes your image file sizes smaller
57:32
leading to faster load times and page speed is a google ranking signal there's a free tool for compressing
57:38
images called short pixel which has both a web interface as well as a wordpress plugin
57:44
and the last thing i highly recommend is to optimize for readability here are five simple but effective tips you can
57:50
use to improve readability number one write in short sentences and short
57:56
paragraphs because no one wants to land on a page with a huge wall of text
58:01
two use descriptive subheadings so people who are skimming the article can easily
58:06
find the things that are important to them 3. use a large enough font that's easily
58:11
readable on both desktop and mobile 4. avoid using big words it's more
58:17
important that people understand your content and 5. write as you speak your
58:22
content will be more conversational and entertaining to read a free tool i recommend using is called
58:28
hemingway app it'll give you some writing tips as well as a readability grade i'd recommend trying to keep
58:34
things at or below a sixth grade level now there are other on-page optimizations you can do like adding
58:41
open graph meta tags or og tags for short these will allow you to customize the titles descriptions images and other
58:48
information when your pages are shared on social media networks there's also schema markup which is code
58:54
that helps search engines understand your content and better represent it in the search results for example these
59:01
pages use the recipe schema type so google is able to show things like the recipe's rating the number of votes the
59:08
total time to make the food as well as nutritional information if you have a wordpress site then you
59:14
can add og tags in schema with plugins like rank math or yoast now again the most important part of
59:20
your content is that you're striving to satisfy searcher intent yes the technical things are important
59:26
too but they're more like the icing on the cake so here's a full on-page seo checklist take a screenshot and let's
59:33
move on to the next module which is on an seo strategy called link building
What is link building and why it is important
59:39
hey it's ammo and welcome to the third module in our seo course for beginners throughout the next five lessons we'll
59:44
be talking about arguably the most important and most challenging seo
59:50
strategy it's called link building and to kick things off we're going to talk about what it is why it's important and
59:56
the mindset you'll need to have to be successful at it let's get started so what is link building by definition link
1:00:03
building is the process of getting other websites to link to a page on your website and these hyperlinks are called
1:00:09
backlinks now while the end result might make sense conceptually and seem simple
1:00:14
the part that most people don't understand and can't seem to get right is this
1:00:20
the process and this ultimately boils down to emailing complete strangers and asking
1:00:26
them to link to you now let's take a quick second to talk about how strange and kind of awkward this might sound so
1:00:33
let's go through a few scenarios and then we'll revisit this definition of link building let's say that you have a marketing blog
1:00:39
and you write about seo and digital marketing now if some random person let's call her sally sent you an email
1:00:46
and said hey can you link to my post on facebook ads it's really good would you
1:00:52
link to her probably not in fact you probably wouldn't even reply or click the link in
1:00:58
her email to actually check and see if her content is as good as she claims
1:01:03
now let's flip the script a bit let's say that you've been following ahrefs youtube channel and blog for some time
1:01:09
you've implemented some of the strategies we've shared and gotten some great results for your site on top of
1:01:15
that you've been using our seo tools for three years now an email pops up in your inbox from
1:01:21
me samo a name and face you might recognize because you've been following our channel and in that email i've asked
1:01:28
you to link to our free backlink checker from your page that lists the 15 best free seo tools would you link to me
1:01:36
maybe now the final scenario let's say your mentor who helped you get started in digital marketing sends you an email and
1:01:43
she asked you to link to a page on her site from a relevant page on yours would you link to her
1:01:49
definitely she helped you get started in digital marketing you obviously trust and respect her and you'd be willing to
1:01:56
bend over backwards for her the point of these scenarios is to show you that the process of link building is actually
1:02:02
very relational and can sometimes take more time than you might like with sally you don't know her you don't
1:02:08
owe her anything you don't trust her she's blindly coming in almost invading
1:02:14
your inbox and asking you for a favor without offering any kind of value in
1:02:19
return in the second scenario when i hypothetically emailed you you knew who i was i had indirectly helped you and
1:02:26
you were a user of a product for years so while we may not have a real-life relationship we're still connected in
1:02:32
some way so the chances of linking to me are probably higher than linking to sally
1:02:38
now when your mentor asked you for a link there's a real relationship there there's a sense of trust respect and
1:02:45
gratitude so of course you would link to her now while you can't and shouldn't try to become friends with everyone just
1:02:52
to get links you'll find that your best links will usually come from relationships that are sparked from
1:02:57
email outreach so let's redefine link building and set the tone for the rest of this module link building is the
1:03:03
process of building relationships with other relevant site owners who want and
1:03:08
will link to your content because it enhances theirs so this definition isn't just about you
1:03:14
getting something it includes relationships relevance and a value exchange all things we'll touch on later
1:03:20
in this module now since effective link building is tough you need to understand why it's worth the effort in short
1:03:27
backlinks are used by search engines like google to help rank web pages and it's been this way since 1998 when
1:03:33
google created page rank page rank is a mathematical formula that judges the value of a page by looking at the
1:03:40
quantity and quality of other pages that link to it and google confirms the importance of backlinks on their house
1:03:46
search works page under their ranking useful pages heading they state if other
1:03:51
prominent websites on the subject link to the page that's a good sign that the information is of high quality
1:03:59
we also found a clear correlation between organic traffic and backlinks from unique websites in our study of
1:04:05
over 1 billion web pages so while getting backlinks may be harder than let's say creating a blog post
1:04:11
they're absolutely critical if you want to rank for competitive phrases and competitive phrases are usually the ones
1:04:18
that will drive the most traffic and revenue for your business now we briefly touched on the main way
1:04:24
of getting backlinks but not all links can or will be obtained through outreach
1:04:29
so in the next lesson we'll talk about three methods to get backlinks as well as the level of difficulty and
1:04:35
effectiveness hey it's ammo and welcome to the second lesson in our link building module in
How to get backlinks for your site
1:04:41
this lesson we'll talk about three link building strategies to get backlinks now before we get started it's important to
1:04:48
set the expectations right for this lesson and talk about the difference between a strategy and a tactic to me
1:04:54
strategies are higher level in the sense that it outlines the scope of the plans whereas tactics are more micro and often
1:05:02
focused around smaller steps so the strategy sets you in the right direction and the tactics kind of define
1:05:08
how you get there and we'll get into a few link building tactics later on in this module alright so when it comes to
1:05:14
link building there are three main strategies to get backlinks you can create them buy them or earn them let's talk about
1:05:22
what each method looks like their level of difficulty and effectiveness the first method is to create backlinks
1:05:28
creating backlinks means to manually add links on one domain back to yours this
1:05:34
can be done by adding your website to directories leaving comments on blog posts or adding your website's url to
1:05:40
your social media profile anyone can do this with minimal effort so like almost all easy things in life
1:05:46
they're generally not that effective from an seo and ranking perspective now buying backlinks is exactly as it
1:05:53
sounds you pay webmasters or authors a fee and in return they'll link back to a
1:05:58
page on your site now this is against google's webmaster guidelines and can potentially result in a penalty that
1:06:05
might be anything from losing ranking positions or even worse getting your pages removed from google search index
1:06:12
also buying links isn't exactly cheap we contacted 250 websites to ask if they
1:06:17
sell links and we found that the average cost of buying one was nearly 353 dollars and of course we didn't buy
1:06:25
any in terms of level of ease if you have the money it's super easy to do because
1:06:30
it's just the transaction now in terms of the effectiveness i would think that they're highly effective unless or until you get caught
1:06:39
and in my opinion the risk isn't worth the reward especially if you want to build a business that'll stand the test
1:06:45
of time the final way to get backlinks is to earn them and there are three common ways you can do this the first
1:06:51
and most common are links that are earned through email outreach this is when you email other website owners and
1:06:57
editors and ask them to link to you another way to earn backlinks is by becoming a source for an online
1:07:03
publication or media outlet for example if a journalist references you in an article they'll often link to
1:07:10
you and or your social media profiles and the final way is to earn backlinks
1:07:15
organically for example if someone visits your page from a link on social media organic search word of mouth or
1:07:22
wherever and decides to link to you then that's an earned link now even though 100 organic links may
1:07:29
sound like the best way to get them i don't want you to bank on that these kinds of links are typically less
1:07:34
consistent unless you're an extremely well-known brand with extremely well-crafted content and you're already
1:07:41
getting significant exposure it takes time to build a reputation that's well trusted and for those organic links to
1:07:47
come in on a regular basis and if you're just hoping and waiting you'll likely fall behind because your competitors
1:07:54
will actually be busy building links by reaching out to other website owners generally speaking the harder it is to
1:08:01
obtain a link the more valuable it'll be and for that reason we'll be focusing on streamlined tactics so that you can
1:08:07
build a steady stream of backlinks to your page and get more traffic from seo now not all links are created equal some
1:08:15
will propel your pages to the top of google while others can actually hurt your site so what makes the link
1:08:21
actually good that's what we'll be talking about in the next lesson hey it's samo and welcome to the third
What makes a backlink “good”
1:08:27
lesson in the link building module today we're going to talk about the attributes that make a backlink good or high
1:08:33
quality as i said in the last lesson not all backlinks are created equal for
1:08:39
example if you spammed forms with links to your site those wouldn't and shouldn't hold more weight than let's
1:08:45
say a link from the new york times otherwise backlinks would just be a game of quantity and google search results
1:08:51
would reward the biggest spammers fortunately ranking on google doesn't work that way and quality backlinks are
1:08:58
still a prominent ranking signal so with that said let's talk about the five attributes that make a backlink good the
1:09:05
first attribute is relevance imagine this for a second you're going to visit greece for the first time next month and
1:09:12
you need recommendations for places worth going to now you have a friend that lived in greece for their entire life and
1:09:19
obviously knows every nook and cranny you also have a friend in the u.s who hates traveling and has never been
1:09:25
outside of the states whose opinion would you hold higher obviously your greek friend in the same
1:09:31
way links from a website about travel or greece would hold more weight than links from sites about technology or marketing
1:09:39
because they're more topically relevant and authoritative for example you'll see that this page is ranking number one for
1:09:45
the query how to devein shrimp if we look at their backlinks and also filter by one link per domain we can see their
1:09:52
backlinks from different websites now if you don't have an ahrefs account then you can still see backlinks pointing at
1:09:58
pages using our free backlink checker tool which i'll leave a link to in the description
1:10:03
going back to the backlinks report you'll see this page from wikihow which is called three ways to peel and devein
1:10:10
shrimp so the link is on a very relevant page scrolling down a bit you'll see this
1:10:15
link from a page called shrimp with garlic sauce which again is relevant at the page level but you can also see that
1:10:22
it's relevant at the domain level too just by looking at the domain name slimpalette.com
1:10:28
both of these links are great from a relevant standpoint whereas a link like this one isn't very relevant at all the
1:10:35
page is about firefox 3.5 which is a web browser it comes from a site about video games and computer hardware so an ideal
1:10:42
link would be contextually placed within the body of the content where someone is quite literally recommending or
1:10:49
referencing you alright the next quality of good quality links is authoritativeness
1:10:55
if you're unfamiliar with authority in the context of backlinks it basically represents the so-called link power a
1:11:01
web page has and this relates to how google page rank works as we discussed before both the quantity
1:11:08
and quality of links matter so the more quality links a page gets the more page
1:11:13
rank it earns and the more page rank it has the more authority it can pass to other pages through hyperlinks
1:11:20
for example let's say that page c has two links one from page a and one from page b
1:11:27
page a is stronger than page b and also has fewer outgoing links feed this
1:11:32
information into the pagerank algorithm and you get the page rank of page c now this is obviously a simplified
1:11:38
version of how pagerank works but the key point here is that getting links from high authority pages will likely
1:11:45
have the greatest impact on your rankings now while google doesn't provide page rank or website authority scores we have
1:11:52
two metrics at ahrefs that try to quantify it domain rating is our website authority metric and it represents the
1:11:58
overall strength of a website's backlink profile an url rating is our page level authority metric which represents the
1:12:05
overall strength of a page's backlink profile and you'll find both of these metrics throughout most of our tools giving you
1:12:12
insights on referring pages now we've covered two very important parts of good quality backlinks but what
1:12:18
we haven't talked about yet is the actual link itself so let's break down the anatomy of a
1:12:24
hyperlink and talk about how the different parts relate to seo here's what a link looks like to your
1:12:29
website visitors and if we look at the html code then it would look like this
1:12:35
now there are three basic parts to a link that matter in seo the destination url anchor text and the rel attribute or
1:12:42
lack of one the destination url is simply the url the person will visit when the link is
1:12:48
clicked the second part of a link is the anchor text the anchor text is the clickable word phrase or image attached
1:12:55
to the link so in our example site explorer is the anchor text which is the name of our competitor analysis tool
1:13:02
google uses anchor text to better understand what a page is about and what terms it should rank for but building
1:13:09
lots of links with keyword rich anchors is an example of a link scheme and may result in a google penalty as it looks
1:13:16
unnatural for example if you had a post on the best golf balls and had 100 links
1:13:21
pointing to it where the anchor texts were all best golf balls then it would look and be quite unnatural
1:13:28
people often use anchors such as the company's brand name the title of the page the url or phrases like click here
1:13:36
and here's some proof if we look at the anchors of backlinks pointing to our data study on featured snippets you'll
1:13:41
see varying anchor texts like ahrefs old studies hr study research and even
1:13:48
specific stats like 12.3 percent of search queries and 99.58 percent and so
1:13:54
on in fact there are only 16 websites that have linked to us using the anchor text featured snippet
1:14:01
with most earned links you have very little or no control over the anchor text so over optimization isn't
1:14:08
something you really need to worry about and the last part of the link we'll talk about is the rel attribute some links
1:14:14
contain a rel attribute which is intended to tell crawlers about the relationship between the linking page
1:14:20
and the linked page and the three rel values that you should know about when it comes to link building are nofollow ugc and sponsored
1:14:29
historically nofollow links told google that the linking page would rather not associate themselves with the linked
1:14:35
page and for that reason google didn't transfer authority through those links but then google added a couple other rel
1:14:42
values ugc which stands for user generated content and sponsored which
1:14:47
signifies an ethical paid link they also announced that going forward they would look at these link attributes
1:14:53
as hints meaning they may pass value through them at their discretion now if a link doesn't have any of these
1:15:00
rel values then it will be called a followed link meaning the link can pass page rank and help boost your rankings
1:15:08
seeing as this is still relatively new i'd recommend focusing on building followed links although that's only
1:15:14
partially within your control now it's important to note that nofollow in ugc links aren't bad it's just that
1:15:20
followed links are proven to pass authority one final thing i want to touch on is link placement
1:15:27
prominent links are more likely to be clicked and it's believed that google takes this into account when determining
1:15:32
how much authority a link transfers for instance an editorial link is more
1:15:37
likely to be clicked than a link in the footer so all else being equal the former will be better than the latter
1:15:44
so to summarize an ideal link would come from a relevant and authoritative page
1:15:49
where the link is followed it would have a descriptive anchor and be placed contextually within editorial content
1:15:56
but the truth is a lot of this is out of your control what is in your control is how you spend
1:16:02
your time building links by using these five attributes to help qualify prospects or people that are worth
1:16:09
contacting you'll spend your time building links that will actually move the needle
1:16:14
now the easiest way for a beginner to start building links is to use tried and tested tactics and we'll be covering a
1:16:20
few of them in the next lesson hey it's ammo and welcome to the fourth lesson in the link building module today
What are link building tactics for beginners
1:16:27
we're going to talk about the step-by-step process to build backlinks as well as three cookie cutter link
1:16:32
building tactics that are tried tested and completely beginner friendly let's
1:16:38
get started with the general process to link building there are three general stages in link building prospecting
1:16:44
vetting and email outreach when prospecting you're searching for relevant pages and websites that might
1:16:50
link to you these might be people who are linking to a similar page as the one you're going to create those who have
1:16:56
influence in your industry or people who are passionate about the topic the main goal isn't to find a perfect
1:17:02
list of people this stage is about finding as many people as possible that fit a specific set of criteria and this
1:17:09
criteria is usually dictated by link authority metrics as well as relevance as a result you'll usually be working
1:17:16
with large and very unperfect sets of data the vetting stage is where you start to
1:17:22
refine your list of prospects these are the people that you'll be contacting so you'll need to visit their websites and
1:17:28
validate that they are indeed people worth contacting finally is the email outreach stage this
1:17:34
is when you finalize your pitches and start emailing your vetted prospects now depending on the link building
1:17:40
tactic you use the way you prospect vet and craft your email pitches will differ
1:17:46
and this is actually quite difficult when you're new to link building fortunately there are a few dead simple
1:17:51
but super effective link building tactics that are completely newbie friendly but before we can get tactical
1:17:58
let's revisit our definition of link building because there are three main parts in it that will help you with prospecting vetting and email outreach
1:18:06
again link building is the process of building relationships with other relevant site owners who want and will
1:18:12
link to your content because it enhances theirs now i want to highlight the three main
1:18:17
parts from this definition relationships relevance and a value exchange we already talked about the
1:18:24
relevance part in the last lesson now we're talking about mainly the value exchange and what that looks like in
1:18:30
some common link building tactics so let's dig into a few easy link building tactics and i'll show you what
1:18:36
each stage of the link building process looks like in detail plus i'll outline the value exchange for each tactic to
1:18:42
give you a better idea of what i mean alright the first link building tactic is to get free pr using hero
1:18:48
hero or help a reporter out is a free service that connects journalists with sources and sources with journalists
1:18:55
just sign up as a source and select the categories where you're qualified to answer questions you'll then get emails
1:19:02
from journalists from various media outlets looking for sources on specific topics and these aren't just your
1:19:08
run-of-the-mill publications in just a single email you'll see publications like parents.com
1:19:14
popsugar and the houston chronicle to name a few just skim through the topics and if you find something where you can
1:19:21
add value respond to the journalist with your expert opinion and if they use you as a source they'll usually link back to
1:19:28
your site and social media profiles now the value exchange here is simple you're exchanging your expert knowledge for a
1:19:35
mention and usually a link from an authoritative site from my personal experience i've gotten
1:19:40
links from places like reader's digest inc magazine forbes and the huffington post to name a few
1:19:47
now looking at the three stages of link building the prospecting part is as easy as it gets
1:19:52
you sign up for a free service and journalists are actually looking for your help not the other way around which
1:19:59
makes harrow super beginner friendly as for vetting you can simply scan through the results on a daily basis but that
1:20:05
can be time consuming a simple tip you can use is to create a gmail filter so only relevant emails will surface in
1:20:12
your inbox just log into gmail and click on the caret to bring down the search options next set the from field to
1:20:20
harrow helperreporter.com then you'll want to set the subject to harrow within square brackets since all
1:20:27
of their emails include that in the subject line finally set the has the words field to any keywords you want to
1:20:34
monitor and you can also use the or search operator to include multiple keywords or phrases
1:20:41
click search to see the results your search filters would include and check out some of the emails to ensure you're
1:20:46
getting relevant results if everything looks good click on the caret again and then click create filter
1:20:53
you'll then have the options to apply labels mark it as important or forward it to another team member to take care
1:21:00
of now as for the email outreach part harold gives you an email address which will then be forwarded to the journalist
1:21:07
so just respond to the given email address and write your response now obviously you're not going to be the
1:21:13
only person emailing the journalist so here are a few tips you can use to improve your hit rate number one keep
1:21:20
your emails as short as needed journalists get tons of emails and if they see a huge wall of text they
1:21:27
probably won't even give your response a chance number two go after topics where
1:21:33
journalists are likely looking for multiple sources for example this query from best life is
1:21:39
seeking medical experts as in the plural form of expert these kinds of requests will usually be
1:21:46
your typical listicle-styled posts so the more responses they accept the higher your chances of getting mentioned
1:21:52
and linked to number three respond as quickly as possible journalists on hero will often
1:21:58
give a tighter deadline to give themselves time to actually put together a good story plus some journalists
1:22:05
believe that people who respond faster are better sources don't believe me here's what a journalist from reader's
1:22:11
digest said to me the deadline was just to make sure i get people to respond in a timely manner i actually have the rest
1:22:18
of the month to put the story together which is nice i find the tighter the deadline i attach the better the
1:22:23
response is because the only people who go to the effort are ones who really have something relevant to offer
1:22:30
obviously this doesn't apply to every journalist but it kind of makes sense all right tip 4 is to prioritize
1:22:37
questions where you are an expert and use it as the first line in your pitch
1:22:43
there will be days where you can't respond to every relevant request so prioritize the ones where you have the
1:22:48
highest probability of getting sourced for example popsugar is looking for experts who can talk about why cats
1:22:56
scratch furniture and how to stop them from doing it if you're a vet then you might start your email with something
1:23:02
like hi jenna my name is sam oh and i'm a veterinarian with 12 years experience and a board member of the cat alliance
1:23:10
clearly i'm not a vet but you get my point when you immediately qualify yourself as the right person to answer the question
1:23:17
you'll likely get their attention of course you should be 100 honest so i wouldn't claim to be a vet when i'm not
1:23:24
and finally follow all directions in their query for example this one says
1:23:29
please be sure to include your full name pronouns title and credentials and the website you'd like linked with your name
1:23:37
all right the next link building tactic is guest posting or guest blogging same thing guest blogging is when you create
1:23:43
content for another website and the reason why this strategy works is because there's a clear value exchange
1:23:50
they get great content for free and almost always they allow you to link back to your site whether that be within
1:23:56
the content or in the author bio now guest blogging also provides another great benefit
1:24:02
aside from a potential backlink you get the opportunity to get exposure to someone else's audience they've already
1:24:09
done the hard work in building that audience you just have to write something that'll impress their readers
1:24:15
now when you're prospecting you'll need to get a list of websites and there are a few ways you can do that the first way
1:24:21
is to use google search operators just go to google and search for something like in title colon write for us wrapped in
1:24:28
quotes and then a keyword that's related to your niche in this case this search query will show
1:24:34
us pages that include the phrase write for us in the title and have the word golf balls somewhere on the page and
1:24:40
this is a common footprint that websites use to attract guest writers now because you'll want to write for sites with some
1:24:47
kind of link authority you can use ahrefs seo toolbar to see link authority metrics right within google search
1:24:53
results and if you don't have an ahrefs account you can use our free website authority checker to see the domain
1:24:59
ratings for these sites another way to find a list of sites fast is to use ahrefs content explorer
1:25:06
content explorer is a searchable database where you can find pages on any topic along with both social
1:25:12
and seo metrics to get started just enter a topic that's related to your niche and run the search
1:25:19
next you'll want to set some filters to ensure that a you're getting relevant results and b that you're reaching out
1:25:25
to websites that have some kind of link authority so first i'll set the language filter to
1:25:31
english since that's the only language i'll be able to write in then i'll set a domain rating filter and
1:25:36
set it to a range like 30 to 60. now if this is your first time guest
1:25:42
blogging then you may want to set a lower range like 10 to 30 to get practice before pitching more
1:25:47
authoritative sites or if you're a seasoned guest blogger then you can try something like 40 to 70.
1:25:54
alright so next i'll enable this filter one page per domain which will narrow our results to one page per website and
1:26:01
this is almost a must do kind of thing because there's no point in pitching the same website numerous times
1:26:08
now with around two hundred thousand domains you might be wondering which ones allow guest posts the truth is you
1:26:15
won't know until you ask but there's a way to improve your hit rate and that's to look at websites that have previously
1:26:22
accepted guest authors to find those sites just click on the websites tab and make sure that your
1:26:28
results are sorted by the number of authors basically the more authors you see the
1:26:33
more probable it is that they accept guest posts either that or they have a big staff of
1:26:38
writers from here you can export the results and then move on to the vetting stage
1:26:44
at this point you'll want to do a quick check to make sure that the websites don't look spammy and that they're
1:26:49
actually relevant to your site for example golfballs.com is clearly going to be relevant and it's not spammy
1:26:56
at all seeing as it's just a regular e-commerce site as for metricscat.com the domain doesn't
1:27:03
look like it's about golf and if you visit the site you'll see that it looks like a software company so
1:27:08
we'd exclude this domain from our outreach list now another thing worth checking is the
1:27:13
domain's site-wide organic traffic to do that go to site explorer and search for the domain
1:27:19
next click on the organic search tab if the site is getting consistent search traffic like this then it's a good sign
1:27:26
that the domain is in good standing with google domains that have an organic traffic like this is probably something
1:27:33
you'd want to exclude when vetting sites reason being this huge decline in search
1:27:38
traffic is telling us that google may have penalized the website so you probably wouldn't want to associate your
1:27:44
domain with theirs now when you're vetting you'll likely want to find around 10 times the number of posts you
1:27:50
can write in a week for example if you can write two posts per week then try and find 20 vetted sites reason being
1:27:58
most people won't accept your post let alone respond to you alright let's move on to the next stage which is email
1:28:04
outreach now when you're pitching websites for a guest post ideally you want to come up with a good reason as to why they should
1:28:11
accept your post free content is great null but it's not necessarily so convincing that everyone
1:28:18
will accept it so take some time to do your research on the site see how your expertise can be helpful for their
1:28:24
audience or business for example if we look at the blog for golfballs.com you'll see that they have
1:28:31
content on the best golf balls for kids and after searching through their site i
1:28:36
found that they have another guide on the best golf balls for the longest distance now they're missing out on a
1:28:41
lot of these best golf balls for blank and seeing as they're in the business of selling golf balls i could easily pitch
1:28:48
them topics on something like best golf balls for high handicappers which according to ahrefs keywords explorer
1:28:55
gets searched around 800 times per month globally so i might send them an email and say something like hey whatever the
1:29:02
editor's name is i was digging through your site and saw that you have a couple of posts on the best golf balls for kids
1:29:08
and for a distance but i was pretty surprised to see that you don't have one for other types of players i.e seniors
1:29:15
being a high handicapper myself i spent hundreds of dollars on balls and countless hours on launch monitors to
1:29:21
find the best ball for me if you're open i'd love to write a post for you about how to find the best golf balls for
1:29:28
hacky golfers like myself i'm happy to share all the data and stats which i think will help people make an informed
1:29:34
decision as they shop through your store is that something you'd be open to cheers sam
1:29:40
now with this outreach email i'm showing them that i've done my research on their site i'm a golfer myself i have some
1:29:46
unique data which i spent time and money to get and i'm also showing them how my posts could help them get more sales
1:29:53
we'll talk quite a bit about outreach in the next lesson so let's move on to the final tactic which is the skyscraper
1:29:59
technique the skyscraper technique is a link building tactic where you find content that has a lot of links create
1:30:05
your own version on the topic but improve on it and then reach out to those linking to the popular post and
1:30:12
ask them to link to yours now if we were to go through the prospecting vetting and outreach stages
1:30:18
this lesson would be extended another seven to eight minutes so instead i'll link up a video which will take you
1:30:24
through the entire process step by step in fact we have an entire playlist
1:30:29
dedicated to link building tactics strategies and processes so i highly recommend watching that too
1:30:35
now prospecting and vetting are pretty straightforward but the hardest part of link building and the part that makes
1:30:41
link building challenging is outreach so the next lesson is dedicated to crafting
1:30:47
highly effective outreach emails hey it's ammo and welcome to the final
How to do blogger outreach for backlinks
1:30:52
lesson in our link building module today we're going to cover how to do blogger outreach that leads to backlinks and
1:30:58
this may very well be the most important lesson in this entire module because
1:31:04
nearly all link building tactics require some sort of email exchange so today
1:31:09
we'll cover the primary objectives of blogger outreach two common approaches and i'll break down the anatomy of a
1:31:15
good quality outreach email let's get started so the primary objective of blogger outreach is to convince those
1:31:21
with large targeted audiences to talk about you and from the perspective of an seo you want them to link to your
1:31:28
website now outreach doesn't mean broadcasting meaning you shouldn't be sending every single person the exact
1:31:34
same email like you would through email marketing for example this outreach email that i got is what typical blogger
1:31:41
outreach looks like today first of all i can see that they didn't even take a second to check what my name
1:31:46
is when literally two-thirds of all pages on my personal site have my full name on them instead they stuck with the
1:31:54
generic there used it in the mass mailing software and broadcasted it out to hundreds maybe even thousands of
1:32:01
people but the name thing isn't that big of a deal second this is clearly a generic
1:32:06
templated email with zero consideration for the recipients the person says i'm
1:32:12
writing because i saw your post here then they didn't even take a second to proofread the email and their
1:32:18
justification for me to link to them is because it fits well in my post
1:32:23
on top of that the person followed up with me three more times with nearly the exact same email all sent within the
1:32:31
same 30 minute period this ladies and gentlemen is called spam
1:32:36
and the results of these kinds of emails lead to nothing the page the person wanted me to link to got a total of two
1:32:43
backlinks and both of them are irrelevant and look like they've been paid for and those backlinks aren't
1:32:49
moving the needle since the page gets zero organic search visits these kinds of emails along with hundreds of others
1:32:55
in my inbox are prime examples of why you need to write good quality emails
1:33:01
otherwise you'll just blend in with the rest of the spam people get on a daily basis after all these are unsolicited emails
1:33:09
now to be clear it doesn't mean that you can't use some sort of template to send a lot of emails efficiently for example
1:33:16
i literally just got this email in my inbox and it says hey sam i just published a roundup post about the best
1:33:23
personal blogs to read and i featured you in it and that's a link to his post then he explicitly says but i'm not
1:33:30
looking for a share or anything like that i just wanted to say thank you for all the inspiration you've brought to
1:33:35
the blogosphere and digital marketing world best of luck in your endeavors and keep up the good work on ahrefs youtube
1:33:42
channel this email didn't come to my ahrefs email account it came to the one on my personal site so he clearly did a bit of
1:33:49
digging before sending the email and i'm sure he sent a similar message to all 117 people he featured so you might be
1:33:57
thinking what's the point of this email if he's not asking for anything we'll get to that later in this lesson
1:34:03
now the first email that i just showed you is one of the common approaches to blogger outreach it's called the shotgun
1:34:09
approach where you build a broad list of targets load them up into an outreach tool and then blast out emails to anyone
1:34:17
and everyone the opposite approach to this is the sniper method this is when you choose targets carefully based on a
1:34:23
tight set of criteria and then send personalized emails of the two methods we recommend going
1:34:30
with a sniper approach because shotgunning emails to anyone and everyone is a surefire way to burn
1:34:36
bridgets plus no one likes spam and for that reason the rest of this lesson will
1:34:41
be centered around the sniper approach so before we get into actually crafting your outreach emails let's quickly talk
1:34:48
about who you should be contacting and how to find their email addresses in general you'll want to contact the
1:34:54
author of the post if they work for the website for example this is a post
1:34:59
written by joshua hardwick on the ahrefs blog seeing as his profile states head of
1:35:04
content at ahrefs you know he works there and controls what gets published on the ahrefs blog
1:35:10
now for this post by josh there wouldn't be any use in contacting him because he doesn't work for sitepoint in this case
1:35:17
you'd want to contact the editor of the blog to find who that person is you can check places like the websites about our
1:35:24
team page their write for us page if they have one or their company's linkedin profile
1:35:30
now to actually find the person's email address the easiest way is to check contact in about pages this works best
1:35:37
for websites with one author for websites that have multiple people involved like sitepoint or ahrefs you
1:35:43
usually won't find individuals email addresses on their site so to find these emails you can use a tool like hunter.io
1:35:51
go to their email finder tool and just search for their first and last name as well as the domain hunter will then give
1:35:58
you their best guess in this case they're wrong but the success rate is generally quite high
1:36:04
alright so if you've done the work for the lessons in this module to this point then you should have chosen one of the three tactics i outlined created a list
1:36:11
of prospects vetted your list and found some email addresses so it's time to actually write
1:36:16
the pitch now while there isn't exactly a streamlined formula for every outreach
1:36:22
email you send i want to talk about the anatomy of a simple outreach email that has been effective for me for many years
1:36:28
now and there are five main parts to a typical outreach email first is the subject line the goal of the subject
1:36:35
line is simply to get them to open the email otherwise there's no chance at getting a response but you don't want to
1:36:42
click bait them because that'll only leave a bad impression so when you're writing a subject line you want to
1:36:48
briefly and accurately describe why you're emailing them and ideally evoke curiosity
1:36:54
if we look back at my guest blogging outreach email from the previous lesson i showed you a hypothetical pitch where
1:37:00
i asked if i could write a post for a golf site and share data i have on the best golf balls for high handicappers so
1:37:07
i might use a subject line like new data best balls for high handicappers
1:37:12
in my opinion the new data part evokes curiosity and the rest of the subject line explains the topic of the email the
1:37:20
next part is the introduction and while there are numerous ways to write an intro i think it's best to start by
1:37:26
telling them why you're emailing them and the goal of this part is to get them to read the next part of the email
1:37:32
for example with our guest posting sample email i said i was digging through your site and saw that you have
1:37:38
a couple of posts on the best golf balls for kids and for distance but i was pretty surprised to see that you don't
1:37:44
have one for other types of players i.e seniors now i will admit that the first sentence
1:37:50
could definitely be stronger but i'm basically saying that you've done this and this but looks like you're missing
1:37:56
out on an opportunity here the next part of the email is qualification and justification
1:38:02
simply asking someone for a favor and expecting them to see a mutual benefit is naive you need to show them why
1:38:09
you're qualified and justify the pitch that we'll get to in a second for example if you're contacting someone
1:38:15
to guest post then explain why they should accept your post over potentially hundreds of other submissions
1:38:22
if you're asking them to add your link to a page on their site give them an actual good reason why they should
1:38:28
so in our guest posting sample you'll see that i said being a high handicapper myself i spent hundreds of dollars on
1:38:34
balls and countless hours on launch monitors to find the best ball for me so the fact that a i mentioned i'm a
1:38:41
high handicapper and b i've tested numerous balls and gotten factual data
1:38:47
from launch monitors qualifies and justifies what i'm about to pitch which
1:38:52
again is a guest post about the best golf balls for high handicappers now to really drill in on the concept of
1:38:59
qualification and justification let's look at an example email for the skyscraper technique
1:39:04
a little while back we did some outreach to get links to our blog post on seo statistics so we email people with an
1:39:11
email that looks something like this hi name i saw you mentioned how 93 of
1:39:17
online experiences begin with a search engine on your page about how to do keyword research that's our reason for
1:39:23
contact we then went on to say that stat is actually 14 years old more recent
1:39:29
research suggests that this number has gone down to 68 i think it's lower because social and
1:39:35
other sources now account for around one third of traffic that's our qualification and
1:39:40
justification for what we're about to pitch and obviously the next part of the email is the pitch
1:39:47
the pitch essentially includes your ask as well as your value proposition and generally speaking the stronger your
1:39:53
value proposition the higher the chance of getting a link so for a guest posting example i said if you're open i'd love
1:40:00
to write a post for you about how to find the best golf balls for hacky golfers like myself and here's my value
1:40:07
proposition i'm happy to share all of the data and stats which i think will help people make an informed decision as
1:40:14
they shop through your store so not only are they getting data for free but i'm showing them how that can bring value to
1:40:20
their bottom line now it's not always easy to think of a solid value proposition for example in our seo stats
1:40:27
email our pitch was we publish this and a few other fresh seo stats here not
1:40:33
sure if you're actively editing posts but might be worth an update if you are no pressure so what exactly is the value
1:40:40
proposition we're helping bloggers keep their content up to date in fact we didn't even directly ask for a link yet
1:40:47
we were still able to pick up 27 backlinks we actually have a full three-part video series on this exact
1:40:53
case study so i'll link that up in the description and i highly recommend checking it out
1:40:58
alright the last part of the email is a simple one-liner to keep the conversation rolling
1:41:03
simply put you don't want to end your email with a cold hard pitch the purpose of your
1:41:08
first email should be to start a conversation so you might say something like is that something you'd be open to
1:41:14
is there anything i missed what do you think do you agree with our conclusion or whatever
1:41:20
now this is just a basic template you can use as you start blogger outreach but i don't want you to limit yourself
1:41:25
within this box all you're really doing is talking to people and starting to build some kind of relationship just
1:41:33
think about it like an in-person encounter you wouldn't go to a party and ask a complete stranger to buy you a
1:41:38
drink you might strike up a conversation connect with them on a common interest and maybe buy the first round of drinks
1:41:45
expecting nothing in return and as a result they might want to reciprocate by returning an act of kindness
1:41:51
again the goal of the very first email you send is simple start a conversation
1:41:57
and this brings us back to this outreach email that i got the person who mentioned me on their site specifically told me that he's not
1:42:04
looking for a share or anything like that and he literally just wants to say thank you so what did that accomplish
1:42:11
number one i actually read his email number two i responded to him and said thanks for the mention and number three
1:42:18
should he email me again i'll probably open it because i'll recognize his name so while there will be times where it
1:42:25
makes sense to ask for the link or guest posting opportunity right away there are a lot of times when it makes more sense
1:42:32
to just start that conversation and see where it leads the final tip i want to leave you with
1:42:38
is to only use your best work when sending email pitches you don't want to email anyone and
1:42:45
everyone for every single piece of content you create for example if you had a golf site and
1:42:50
you created a post on a topic like what is a handicap there's nothing interesting or unique about it yet it's
1:42:57
still a topic you would probably want to cover coming up with a good reason for them to link to you on this topic will be tough
1:43:04
plus time is finite so it's worth doing outreach for your best content because
1:43:09
there's a higher probability that it'll result in backlinks all right so with everything you've
1:43:15
learned up to this point you should be able to create content for your website that'll get traffic from search engines
1:43:20
but there's still one piece to the fundamentals of seo that we haven't covered and that's technical seo
1:43:27
hey it's ammo and welcome to the final module in ahrefs seo course for beginners throughout the next two
What is technical SEO and why it’s important
1:43:33
lessons we're going to be talking about technical seo and technical seo is the process of optimizing your website to
1:43:40
help search engines find understand and index your pages now for beginners technical seo doesn't
1:43:48
need to be all that technical and for that reason this module will be focused on the basics so you can perform regular
1:43:54
maintenance on your site and ensure that your pages can be discovered and indexed by search engines let's get started all
1:44:02
right so let's talk about why technical seo is important at the core basically
1:44:07
if search engines can't properly access read understand or index your pages then
1:44:12
you won't rank or even be found for that matter so to avoid innocent mistakes like removing yourself from google's
1:44:19
index or diluting a page's backlinks i want to discuss four things that should help you avoid that
1:44:25
first is the no index meta tag by adding this piece of code to your page it's
1:44:30
telling search engines not to add it to their index and you probably don't want to do that and this actually happens
1:44:36
more often than you might think for example let's say you hire design inc to create or redesign a website for
1:44:43
you during the development phase they may create it on a sub-domain on their own site so it actually makes sense for
1:44:50
them to know index the site they're working on but what often happens is after you've approved the design they'll
1:44:55
migrate it over to your domain but they often forget to remove them at a no
1:45:00
index tag and as a result your pages end up getting removed from google search index or never making it in
1:45:08
now there are times when it actually makes sense to no index certain pages for example our authors pages are no
1:45:14
indexed because from an seo perspective these pages provide very little value to
1:45:19
search engines but from a user experience standpoint it can be argued that it makes sense to be there some
1:45:26
people may have their favorite authors on a blog and want to read just their content generally speaking for small sites you
1:45:33
won't need to worry about no indexing specific pages just keep your eye out for no index tags on your pages
1:45:39
especially if after a redesign the second point of discussion is robots.txt
1:45:45
robots.txt is a file that usually lives on your root domain and you should be able to access it at yourdomain.com
1:45:53
robots.txt now the file itself includes a set of rules for search engine crawlers and
1:45:59
tells them where they can and cannot go on your site and it's important to note that a website can have multiple robots
1:46:06
files if you're using sub domains for example if you have a blog on domain.com
1:46:11
then you'd have a robots.txt file for just the root domain but you might also have an ecommerce store that lives on
1:46:18
store.domain.com so you could have a separate robots file for your online store
1:46:24
that means that crawlers could be given two different sets of rules depending on the domain they're trying to crawl
1:46:30
now the rules are created using something called directives and while you probably don't need to know what all
1:46:35
of them are or what they do there are two that you should know about from an indexing standpoint
1:46:41
the first is user agent which defines the crawler that the rules apply to and the value for this directive will be the
1:46:48
name of the crawler for example google's user agent is named googlebot and the
1:46:53
second directive is disallow this is a page or directory on your domain that you don't want the user agent to crawl
1:47:01
for example if you set the user agent to googlebot in the disallow value to a slash you're telling google not to crawl
1:47:08
any pages on your site not good now if you were to set the user agent to an asterisk that means your rules should
1:47:15
apply to all crawlers so if your robot's file looks something like this then it's
1:47:21
telling all crawlers please don't crawl any pages on my site while this might
1:47:26
sound like something you would never use there are times when it makes sense to block certain parts of your site or to
1:47:32
block certain crawlers for example if you have a wordpress website and you don't want your wp-admin
1:47:39
folder to be crawled then you can simply set the user agent to all crawlers and set the disallow value to slash wp admin
1:47:47
now if you're a beginner i wouldn't worry too much about your robots file but if you run into any indexing issues
1:47:53
that need to be troubleshooted robots.txt is one of the first places i check
1:47:59
alright the next thing to discuss are sitemaps sitemaps are usually xml files and they list the important urls on your
1:48:05
website so these can be pages images videos and other files insight maps help
1:48:12
search engines like google to more intelligently crawl your site now creating an xml file can be complicated
1:48:18
if you don't know how to code and it's almost impossible to maintain manually but if you're using a cms like wordpress
1:48:26
there are plugins like yoast and rank math which will automatically generate sitemaps for you to help search engines
1:48:32
find your sitemaps you can use the sitemap directive in your robots file and also submit it in google search
1:48:38
console next up are redirects a redirect takes visitors and bots from one url to
1:48:45
another and their purpose is to consolidate signals for example let's say you have two pages on your website
1:48:51
on the best golf balls an old one at domain.com bestgolfballs2018
1:48:57
and another at domain.com best golf balls seeing as these are highly relevant to
1:49:03
one another it would make sense to redirect the 2018 version to the current version and by consolidating these pages
1:49:11
you're telling search engines to pass the signals from the redirected url to the destination url
1:49:17
and the last point i want to talk about is the canonical tag a canonical tag is a snippet of html code that looks like
1:49:24
this its purpose is to tell search engines what the preferred url is for a page and
1:49:30
this helps to solve duplicate content issues for example let's say your website is
1:49:35
accessible at both http colon double slash yourdomain.com
1:49:40
and https colon double slash yourdomain.com and for whatever reason
1:49:47
you weren't able to use a redirect these would be exact duplicates but by setting a canonical url you're telling search
1:49:54
engines that there's a preferred version of the page as a result they'll pass signals such as
1:50:00
links to the canonical url so they're not diluted across two different pages
1:50:05
now it's important to note that google may choose to ignore your canonical tag looking back at the previous example if
1:50:11
we set the canonical tag to the unsecure http page google would probably choose the secure
1:50:18
https version instead now if you're running a simple wordpress site you shouldn't have to worry about
1:50:24
this too much cmss are pretty good out of the box and will handle a lot of these basic technical issues for you
1:50:31
so these are some of the foundational things that are good to know when it comes to indexing which is arguably the
1:50:37
most important part in seo because again if your pages aren't getting indexed
1:50:42
nothing else really matters now we won't really dig deeper into this because you'll probably only have to worry about
1:50:48
indexing issues if and when you run into problems instead we'll be focusing on technical seo best practices to keep
1:50:56
your website in good health hey it's ammo and welcome to the final lesson in this module and actually it's
What are technical SEO best practices
1:51:03
the last lesson in ahrefs seo course for beginners in this lesson we're going to
1:51:08
go through some technical seo best practices so you can keep your site in good health let's get started so the
1:51:15
first thing you should do is ensure that your site structure follows a logical hierarchy site structure is simply the
1:51:21
way you organize content on your website you can think of it like a mind map at the top you'd have your home page
1:51:28
then you'd probably have main topics that branch out from your home page like your services page your blog and about
1:51:34
page then from these main topics you'd probably have even more branches to other pages
1:51:40
these branches represent internal links which are just links from one page on your site to another and they help
1:51:46
search engines understand the relationship between these pages site structure also helps search engines
1:51:52
to crawl your pages more efficiently which is why having a logical hierarchy is important
1:51:58
now what we've talked about is pretty basic stuff and you may already be doing this but it can get more complex as you
1:52:05
add more pages to your site like blog posts category pages or product pages we
1:52:11
have a full video on how to use internal links to rank higher on google so i'll link that up for you in the description
1:52:17
alright the second thing is to ensure your pages don't load slow as you may know pagespeed has been a
1:52:23
confirmed ranking factor for desktop search since 2010 and in 2018 google
1:52:29
announced that they'd be using page speed in mobile search rankings now you don't need to obsess over every
1:52:35
millisecond it takes for your page to load google says the speed update as we're calling it will only affect pages
1:52:42
that deliver the slowest experience to users and will only affect a small percentage of quarries
1:52:49
so bottom line you don't want your pages to load slow and there are two very basic things that
1:52:55
i think every website should do the first is to cache your website's content
1:53:00
caching is basically a way to temporarily store copies of files so it can be delivered to visitors in a more
1:53:06
efficient way and most web hosting companies that i've come across have caching features
1:53:12
and the second thing you can do is compress your images compressing images makes your file sizes
1:53:18
smaller and smaller files load faster you can use a tool like short pixel which has both a web interface and a
1:53:25
wordpress plugin now if you want to take page speed a step further then it can get quite technical and complex
1:53:32
so we actually created a full tutorial on how to speed up a wordpress website using cloudflare and a wordpress plugin
1:53:39
so i'll leave a link to that in the description and the final thing i want to talk about is to do your best to stay on top of
1:53:45
around 50 potential seo errors trust me it's not as bad as it sounds
1:53:51
there are potentially hundreds of technical seo issues that can and some will definitely happen to your site some
1:53:58
of these things include pages becoming broken that still have internal links pointing at them
1:54:04
orphan pages which are pages on your site that have no incoming internal links
1:54:09
and these are great because it can make it tough for search engines to actually discover them duplicate content issues and redirect
1:54:16
chains to name a few now there's no point in me going through 50 different potential issues because
1:54:22
it'll only matter to you if you run into them so what i recommend you do is run scheduled website audits on your site
1:54:30
and a website audit will give you a full analysis of potential issues that could be harming your website's seo
1:54:36
performance if you're an ahrefs user you can do that using our site audit tool and even if
1:54:41
you don't have an ahrefs paid plan you can sign up for a free ahrefs webmaster tools account which will let you crawl
1:54:48
up to ten 000 pages on each website you own to get started go to ahrefs.com awt and
1:54:55
sign up for your free webmaster tools account then you'll need to verify your website
1:55:00
meaning prove that you actually own it you can do that using google search console which is the easiest method or
1:55:06
if you don't have a search console account you can do it manually just enter your domain and click continue
1:55:13
then verify your website using one of these three methods and i'll actually just go back and use the google search
1:55:19
console method next you'll need to import your sites and i'll choose to run the first audit
1:55:24
now schedule weekly audits and i'll also enable the crawl external links option
1:55:30
to ensure that we catch any broken or redirected outgoing links hit import and the crawl should start
1:55:37
running now after the crawl has completed go to the overview report in your site audit
1:55:42
project and you'll immediately see things like your health score which is a percentage of urls on your site that
1:55:49
don't have errors you'll also see the top issues we found on your site as well as the number of urls that had the issue
1:55:56
so when you run into an issue you can click on the caret to see a description of what it means and also a short
1:56:02
snippet of how to fix it and once you have an idea of what the issue is and how to fix it just click on the number
1:56:09
under the crawled column to see the affected urls then it's just a matter of fixing
1:56:15
them one by one or hiring someone to help and since you set up weekly scheduled audits you can revisit the
1:56:22
overview report to see if there's any seo maintenance you can do and that wraps up ahrefs seo course for
1:56:28
beginners everything you've learned in this course should be enough to get you indexed ranking and to keep your site in
1:56:35
good technical health and i've linked up a playlist in the description to the entire course with all 14 videos which

2:17
SEO Rachel is a baker who runs her own
What is SEO?
2:24
Bakery to expand her business she decided to create an online presence by first
2:29
setting up a Blog she began posting on her blog regularly however even after
2:34
regularly posting on the blog there were barely any visitors showing up deciding
2:39
not to give up Rachel began searching for a solution on the internet that's when she came across SEO or search
2:46
engine optimization a term she's never heard before so let's take a journey together and
2:53
help her learn about SEO search engine optimization is a method that could improve the quality and quantity of the
2:59
audience coming to Rachel's website from search engines it could increase brand awareness attract local customers and
3:06
build credibility and trust and all of this is possible without having to spend
3:12
a single penny to bring visitors to our website Rachel would have to take advantage of the two types of SEO
3:18
on-page and off-page SEO Rachel first decides to tackle on-page SEO and get
3:25
that sorted on-page SEO involved Rachel optimizing her website both in terms of
3:30
content and the technical aspects including the HTML source code schema meta Tags and More she started off by
3:38
using tools like Google AdWords allref and semrush to identify popular Search terms associated with the recipes she
3:45
planned to publish on her blog she began to look for Search terms related to the broader area of baking cooking and
3:51
related topics once she found these Search terms she began to incorporate them into her recipes
3:57
she started off by providing an introduction to the recipe with this she could provide an engaging beginning to
4:04
her story like how the dish reminded her of her childhood and enabled her to
4:09
naturally include the Search terms into the blog she also included these keywords in the actual recipe as well
4:15
additionally she added pictures videos time lapses and more to increase
4:20
credibility and engagement for her content and subsequently persuading search engines to show her content to
4:27
more people after this she moved to the website metacontent that search engines display when her blog appears in search
4:33
results she optimized The Meta tax alt tags header Tags and More this completed the
4:39
on-page aspect of SEO thanks to this she saw a significant increase in the number of visitors coming to her page having
4:47
done all she could on her webpage she now decides to explore what could be done off page to improve her Page's
4:53
visibility on search engines off-page SEO involved Rachel doing things outside her site page to help increase its
5:00
search engine rankings making optimizations outside the site would improve the site's popularity relevance
5:07
trustworthiness and Authority this is possible with the help of reputable websites vouching for your content with
5:14
backlinks social media marketing guest blogging linked unlinked brand mentions
5:19
influencer marketing and much more Rachel also understood that for her
5:25
content to reach people she would have to promote it on social media platforms like Facebook Twitter and Instagram as
5:31
well as Niche platforms like quora Reddit and medium these could help her achieve greater reach for her website by
5:38
sending stronger social signals to search engines leading to the page being shown as
5:43
highly relevant for related searches and audiences and even after understanding
5:49
and implementing all of this Rachel had just scratched the surface of what was possible with SEO
5:55
before we find out what she did next let's have a look at a quiz which of the following is the most effective way to
6:01
improve off-page SEO one creating plenty of web pages of a Content 2. getting
6:08
backlinks from relevant and authoritative sites three acquiring backlinks through link Buy
6:15
4. none of the above let us know your answer in the comments section below for
6:20
a chance to win an Amazon voucher now let's go back to Rachel Rachel decided
6:25
to take up simplylearn's digital marketing certification with classes covering just about everything she
6:31
needed to know about SEO it was only a matter of time before Rachel began to implement her learnings on her website
6:37
and see a massive uptick in the number of viewers coming to her website in time
6:42
she could even earn money off the site by setting up an online shop and with that we've covered an introduction to
6:49
the concepts of SEO and the possibilities it can open for you either as a marketer or a business owner so
6:56
we're going to use a basic example and let's just say you have a Blog you're a food blogger you're passionate about
Why SEO is Important?
7:02
food and your Niche is ice cream and let's just say you have a lot of ice cream recipes you want to get traffic to
7:09
your blog you want people to read your blog and you're curious why am I not ranking for my blog why when people type
7:17
in ice cream recipes and say Google my blog posts don't appear at the top of
7:23
organic rankings and there's a number of reasons why you wouldn't be ranked for
7:29
your blog post or your ice cream recipes and the main reason would be your competitors so there could be somebody
7:36
else out there who is also passionate about ice cream and has been blogging along longer than you and they have more
7:43
content and more blog posts and more pages for Google to rank so that's
7:49
usually the number one reason the other reason is improper usage of keywords and we're going to talk a little bit or it's
7:56
actually a lot more about you know keyword usage in your content so what
8:02
kind of keywords do you want to rank for that's really what we're talking about when we talk about usage of keywords
8:07
what keywords do you want to rank for and how do we work those keywords into the content another reason is poor link
8:13
building practices and really that means our other blog posts or other websites
8:19
linking to you also are you linking to other pages on your website and so it's all about link building and with link
8:26
building it's internal linking so are we linking from one blog post to another and it's external linking our other
8:33
websites of high quality linking to us and so that's what we talk about when we talk about link building and then
8:39
another reason is web page load time so you could be running your blog post on
8:44
say WordPress for example and your blog post isn't loading fast enough well if
8:50
you look at it this way think about it if you're Google would you really want to rank a website or blog post in this
8:57
example number one on Google rankings if that particular page loaded very slow no
9:03
you wouldn't because when somebody clicked on that link in organic search and went to your website they're going
9:08
to have a bad experience because the page is going to load slow so Google doesn't want their users to have a bad
9:14
experience you don't want your users to have a bad experience and so that's why web page load time is a critical factor
9:20
for ranking so we need to make sure that our web pages load fast and then your
9:26
user experience is not good enough so Google again based on my example about the web page load time Google wants
9:33
people to have a good experience when they go from their search engine to your website and there's a lot at play there
9:39
specifically web page load time but also you know Google doesn't want any spam
9:45
content Google doesn't want any pop-ups or overbearing ads on the web page they
9:50
want people to are searching for something in particular let's just say ice cream recipes and they want to find
9:56
a relevant website that has ice cream recipes they want to be able to click on that link and read some good content
10:03
about ice cream recipes it's that simple and that's really what Google's trying to create in their environment and
10:08
that's you as an end user as a website owner you want your users to have a good experience and then why last but not
10:15
least your website is the indexed by mistake and really what we mean is the indexed is Google needs to be able to
10:23
index all the pages on your website so if you have a Blog with a hundred recipes you want Google to have access
10:29
to all 100 recipes so we're going to talk a little bit later about how to get
10:34
your pages ranked or indexed on Google organic search so let's move on to what
10:40
is SEO so sticking with our ice cream Blog theme really SEO search engine
10:47
optimization really is the practice of increasing your pages that Google has
10:53
indexed up the rankings so the end result is we want all our pages to be ranked number one for particular
11:00
keywords so if you want to be ranked for ice cream recipes well there's certain things you need to do so that's
11:06
generally how it works we need to apply search engine optimization to increase a
11:11
page for keyword we want to be found for so let me give you an example so let's
11:16
just say there's a hundred students that participated in an essay competition and so the competition in this particular
11:22
case is evaluated on the basis of is the content relevant are they using suitable
11:28
titles for their essay do they have structure when they're participating in this essay or talking about the essay
11:34
and do they have a suitable synopsis and is the content neat and readable these seem all logical for an essay
11:40
competition well guess what they seem logical for SEO because that's exactly how SEO works it's exactly all those
11:47
points I just made mentioned about structure logic readability organization
11:53
title all those things are what's important in SEO and so we need relevant
12:00
content we need titles for our Pages Google needs to be able to see structure
12:05
we need to have synopsis of what the page is about and that's called The Meta description and then again the the
12:11
content needs to be readable and that's important and so in order to be readable again we're going to talk more about
12:18
site speed because site speed is important okay and when we talk about responsive design when I say respond to
12:23
design that means your site your page needs a load both on desktop and also on
12:29
mobile and so all these things are important just like an essay competition Google is the judge and they need to be
12:36
able to determine what page is best to rank number one number two number three
12:41
Etc on Google Search and then link building remember I mentioned link building a moment ago well link building
12:47
internally and externally also plays a vital role and so we're going to talk about that a little bit later in the
12:52
class when we talk about off-page SEO how does Google rank website and basically Google follows three basic
13:00
steps to rank a website they need to crawl your website they need to take what they crawl back to their servers
13:06
and when they take it back to their servers your web pages they need to you
13:12
know have them available for indexing so when somebody actually types in a keyword into google.com it'll be
13:18
available to be found on organic search so that's what indexing is all about and then Google's job when somebody does
13:25
type in a search query is to basically rank those pages that they've indexed
13:31
from number one to Infinity depending on how many pages are relevant to that search query so really it's about
13:38
crawling indexing and ranking so crawling is simply a process done by
13:43
which Google has Bots and what these Bots do is they go to your web server
13:49
and they're going to crawl every page that they can find and how do they find
13:54
these Pages well they basically follow links you might have heard the term spidering but that's what they call search engine spidering so basically
14:01
what Google's doing is they're building a web so to speak all the links that they're following and so when they can
14:08
follow all these links on your website they're going to be able to crawl them and when they crawl them basically they
14:14
going to take that content and store it on their servers so it's available in their index So based on this method
14:21
Google finds out which websites have relevant content and which ones don't based on certain keywords that are typed
14:28
into Google because if they can't crawl your website you're not going to be found and if you can't be found then you're not going to show up for Relevant
14:34
keywords so we need to make sure your site's available to be crawled and we'll talk about that a little bit later okay
14:40
but let's show you an example so let's just go to Google Search and if I type
14:45
in the keyword simply learn okay I could see I have one way in 10 000 results
14:51
okay and that's how many results are showing up for simply learn okay now they may not all be simply learn pages
14:58
but nonetheless simply learned is ranked number one here organically and there
15:04
are 1 million 10 000 Pages related to the keyword simply learn now when it
15:10
comes to organic search we don't want to get it confused with paid search so anytime time you see paid search you're
15:16
going to see something that says add next to it okay so we could see that there are paid ads here but when it
15:22
comes to organic search those are generally below paid ads and so that's where Google counts the 1 million 10 000
15:30
results and so that's the whole idea behind crawling and indexing Google's
15:35
able to cross simply learns website and based on all the pages that they gather they're going to make those pages
15:41
available in organic search so if you type in a keyword and your web page is
15:47
not available for indexing then you're never going to show up for that keyword so that's why it's important to make
15:54
sure your website is available for crawling and indexing and so when a user
15:59
types a query on search Google search the most relevant websites that are in
16:04
Google's index are going to pair in the search results so in the example I gave was simply learn well simply learn is
16:11
the brand name of the company simply learned so there's a a lot of relevancy there so that's why you see simply learn
16:17
show up here organically number one like we mentioned about what is SEO and why
16:23
SEO we talked about that user experience so there's a lot of factors that go into
16:29
ranking relevancy being one of them so in the simply learned example simply
16:34
learn is relevant to a lot of the simply learned Pages because that's who they are simply learn however simply learn
16:41
also needs to make sure that you know for their Pages the page load time is fast meaning these Pages load very fast
16:49
for the end user and Google also takes into account other factors like how long
16:55
someone is staying on a website or are they bouncing meaning are they going to one page that they land on and then
17:01
leaving the website okay and so the user experience is very very important there
17:06
are other factors also like language and location and so for example location if
17:11
you do a search say in India the results are going to be a little bit different than say the results in the United
17:17
States why because Google is indexing as many web pages as they can find so if
17:23
somebody's doing a search in India their results may be a little bit different than the results show up in the U.S
17:29
because Google has different Bots and these Bots are crawling different pages
17:35
at different times and so Google's index is updating continuously but it's not
17:41
real time syncing so if you do a search in India you may not see exactly the same thing because both search engines
17:48
the Google in India and the Google and the US are may not be exactly synced up
17:53
so an example would be you know if you're looking for Cafe so if you search
17:59
a cafe in say San Francisco you're going to see different results now if you do a
18:04
search for cafes in Mumbai you're going to see different results there's going to be local search here at the top there
18:10
may be some paid search but again you may see different results because one
18:16
location but two Google search engines in India and United States google.com
18:22
aren't exactly synced up exactly at the same exact time you do that search so
18:28
location is important language is important and relevancy is important
18:33
along with user experience so all those are important factors in how Google
18:38
ranks websites okay so we're going to talk about the types of SEO now so if we
18:45
want to rank for a particular keyword on Google we're going to have to apply
18:50
search engine optimization and so there's two strategies to search engine optimization on-page SEO and off-page
18:57
SEO so first we're going to talk about on-page SEO so on page SEO is nothing
Overview of Types of SEO
19:03
more than optimizing your own website and so when we say optimizing your own
19:09
website there's certain elements on your website and on your web pages that we need to take into account and so some of
19:16
those elements are headers meta descriptions title tags linking so all
19:22
of those elements are something we can control as an end user who wants to rank
19:27
our web page and our website on Google and before we do anything with our
19:33
website the first thing we need to do is understand what keywords we want to rank
19:39
for in order to understand what keywords we want to rank for we need to do keyword research and if you do anything
19:46
in SEO keyword research is the most important activity that's the most
19:52
important thing you can do for SEO and why do I say it's the most important because you need to understand if you
19:58
choose a keyword that you want to rank for you need to understand how much traffic you're going to get from that
20:03
keyword if you're ranked organically say number one on Google so how much traffic
20:09
will you get if you're ranked number one on Google so you need to understand what the volume is and the number 2 we need
20:15
to understand what the competition is for that keyword that you want to rank for so if you choose a keyword and
20:20
there's not much competition for it then chances are you can rank for that keyword for a web page on your website
20:27
quicker than say a keyword that has a lot of competition so we need to understand those two basic factors
20:34
volume and competition before we choose a keyword and it's it's simply the practice of going through the motions of
20:42
getting your volume and getting your competition data so you can choose the keywords you want and then once you
20:48
choose the keyword you want then you can go and apply on page SEO you can change
20:54
the title tag The Meta descriptions the headers all those elements can be changed but first you need to choose
21:01
your keywords and so again the primary components we're looking for are how
21:06
much traffic you can get or the search volume how much competition there is for that keyword and of course relevancy
21:12
okay you need to be able to choose a key keyword that's relevant to the web page you're trying to rank for and so let me
21:19
show you example how to go through this so the first thing we want to do is we want to use a tool and the tool I would
21:26
recommend is Google Keyword Planner and why do I choose Google Keyword Planner because if we're trying to rank on
21:32
google.com or Google search engine we want to be able to get the data right from the source so Google's going to be
21:38
able to give us information about how much volume a keyword has and how much competition it has so let me show you an
21:45
example so if I want to use Google's Keyword Planner and I want to rank for
21:50
the keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist then I'm going to type that keyword into Google's Keyword
21:57
Planner and what Google's going to do is they're going to give me some Trends about how much volume this particular
22:05
keyword gets over the course of a year and so for that particular keyword I can
22:10
see that there are trends that that appear for both desktop and mobile so
22:16
mobile is important because people start their search process a lot of times on
22:22
their mobile device so we want to be able to get data from mobile as well as desktop and so we could see a trend here
22:29
that for each particular month over the last 12 months we can see how much
22:34
volume this particular keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist gets per month and so on average on
22:43
average over the past 12 months I could see how to become a digital marketing specialist is averages 30 searches a
22:51
month and this is on google.com and so Google gives us the volume what they also give us is the competition and so
22:58
here I can see Google says for that particular keyword the competition is medium and so in the Google's Keyword
23:06
Planner what they also do is give me other relevant keywords that I might think about optimizing for because you
23:13
don't want to optimize for just one key word so how to become a digital marketing specialist they're going to
23:19
also offer up other types of keywords that are relevant so just digital marketing Specialists social media
23:25
marketing specialist so for those keywords I can see the volume so for example digital marketing specialist I
23:32
can see the average volume is one thousand per month on average of the last 12 months I can also see the
23:38
competition is medium but for some other keywords I can see the search volume being high like digital marketing course
23:45
at 2900 per month but also the competition is high and so what I would recommend is a best practice is to
23:51
collect all your relevant keywords okay and put all your relevant keywords in a
23:56
spreadsheet and when you put all these relevant keywords in a spreadsheet you want to get the data on those keywords
24:02
and the data I'm referring to is the volume and competition so in this case we have volume from Google planner
24:08
Google's Keyword Planner and I have competition from Google's Keyword Planner and so if I go into a spread
24:14
shade and I put all that information in here I'm going to be able to see the volume and competition and so that's
24:19
important however one thing to note here is that Google's Keyword Planner if I go back just gives us low medium and high
24:27
and if I want to compare numbers to numbers maybe I want to be able to get
24:33
exactly the competition number for the keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist what I can do is go
24:40
into Google and I can type in that keyword so if I type in the keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist
24:46
I can see there's 76 Million results so I could see 76 Million results 76.1
24:54
actually and for the keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist now that's a whole lot of results for
25:01
this particular keyword especially when the volume is only 30 per month on
25:07
average and so what I want to do is get a more clear picture of the competition
25:13
and so what you can could actually do is type in the syntax all in title and then
25:18
colon and then your keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist and when I do that I get a different
25:24
result here I can see only 136 listings for how to become a digital
25:31
marketing specialist but that's not just 136 that's 136 with that particular
25:37
keyword that we want to rank for in the title tag okay so the title tag is what
25:43
you see when you type in a keyword or search query in Google search and the
25:49
title tag is what you see at the top of every search result and so now I can see
25:54
I typed in how to become a digital marketing specialist with the all entitled syntax and now I can see every
26:02
listing every one of these 136 results have that particular keyword in it so I
26:09
could see every one of them how to become a digital marketing specialist and why is that important because now
26:15
that tells me I only need to climb over 136 listings to rank for that keyword
26:22
how to become a digital marketing specialist and so the idea here is you
26:27
want to get your volume from Google's Keyword Planner but you want to get your competition from Google search and again
26:33
that's simply typing in the syntax all in title and then your keyword in this
26:39
example how to become a digital marketing specialist once you get those two numbers you're going to plug them in
26:45
to your spreadsheet and then once you do that for number of different keyword queries and these keyword queries again
26:53
have to be relevant once you do that then you can go in and pick the keywords
26:58
you want to optimize for and that's important because again if you're not sure about a keyword then you want to do
27:06
the keyword research so you can be sure of how much traffic you can get and how
27:11
much competition there is those are two important three important factors in starting the process for on-page SEO so
27:18
again you want to create content for say a keyword like
27:24
digital marketing but digital marketing may seem a little bit broad so you want to probably stay
27:30
away from broader keywords because broader keywords tend to have a lot of volume which is great but they may also
27:37
tend to have a lot of competition but that's the whole point of doing the keyword research maybe it doesn't maybe
27:44
there's more volume than competition that's what you need to find out when you do the keyword research you need to
27:50
find those keywords that are relevant to your content that have a lot of volume and low competition and then once we
27:57
identify those keywords then we are free to go in and start optimizing our web
28:03
pages for those keywords and the first place we want to start is the title tag so if you remember my example going back
28:11
here to our search how to become a digital marketing specialist we saw that every one of these listings had that
28:17
keyword in the title tag and the title tag is important because that's what users who use Google search see first
28:25
when they talk type in a query and get results so they're going to see the title tag so the title tag is the most
28:30
important element for on-page SEO it's the most important factor because that's
28:35
what people see and so ideally when we choose our keyword we want to make sure that keyword is in the title tag because
28:42
that's what shows up in Google search and that's what makes that particular web page relevant for that keyword query
28:49
so the idea behind a title tag it's between 50 and 60 characters and so we
28:55
want to make sure we stay within that limit no more than 60 characters because
29:00
what happens if it's beyond that then Google will truncate the title tag so if I go back to my search you can see here
29:07
on this particular title tag Google trunk handed it meaning they added the ellipses after the title tag because it
29:14
exceeded the 60 character limit so you want to stay within those character counts and so the title tag is the first
29:21
place you should start when optimizing your website because we have the right keyword in the title tag and somebody
29:29
types in that keyword then chances are it's going to be relevant they're going to see it and they're going to click
29:34
through to your website and that's the whole idea behind ranking we want to get clicks so that's how the title tag
29:41
appears so when you optimize it you're going to update the title tag and this is how it shows up it's going to show up
29:47
at the top of your listing okay and it's going to be bigger and Bolder than anything else Google displays so the
29:54
second thing you want to optimize is the meta description and The Meta description is simply just a brief
30:00
description up to 155 I would say about 155 to 60 160 characters but probably no
30:08
more than that and so the meta description is nothing more than a summary of the web page itself so if I
30:15
go back to my Google search results I see my title tag and I see the page that
30:21
this particular listing belongs to and underneath that is where I can see my
30:27
meta description so in this particular keyword query how to become a digital marketing specialist I see the meta
30:34
description an ultimate guide on how to build a career in digital marketing and the skills required to become a digital
30:39
marketing specialist note that it's a well-written meta description within 155
30:45
characters and it includes the keyword digital marketing specialist so we're trying to rank for how to become a
30:51
digital marketing specialist and here you can see become a digital marketing specialist so there's a lot of relevancy
30:57
between not only the title tag and the keyword but the meta description and the keyword so when you're optimizing a
31:04
keyword you want to start with the title tag but you also want to update the meta description because if you don't update
31:10
the meta description and you leave The Meta description blank then you're leaving it to Google to add in copy that
31:18
they deem relevant and so for on-page SEO we want to take control of the copy
31:23
and we want to optimize it for the keywords we want to be found for so the meta description is a powerful tool at
31:30
our disposal it gives us more characters to work with it gives us more to talk about so for that particular page and so
31:37
if the title tag is only 60 characters maximum it's not a lot of information to
31:43
try and get somebody to click so the meta description helps us in identifying what that page is about in order to get
31:49
the click so the two working in tandem will hopefully increase your click-through rates so when you're found
31:55
organically we want to get the click and then the third element that's important is the URL and URL stands for uniform
32:03
resource locator and why is the URL so important because that's what people see
32:08
so if I go back to my search result how to become a digital marketing specialist notice that the URL also includes how to
32:15
become a digital marketing specialist article okay so it's very relevant the URL is very relevant one we can see it
32:23
in the search results but two you know it's is relevant to the keyword query and that's important for the end user
32:29
and Google Google wants to know hey is this the page that's relevant to the
32:35
user's query and if it is then this user is likely going to have a good X user
32:41
experience after they click on the listing so the URL is an element that
32:46
helps not only with the click-through rate but with ranking and having a poor URL structure doesn't help at all
32:52
because not only does Google not recognize the URL as being relevant but the end user may not want to click on
33:00
that page given the the way the URL looks so you want to try and avoid a poor URL structure so the rule of thumb
33:07
is this if you don't understand what the URL is then Google is likely not going
33:12
to understand what the URL is and so we want to try and keep our URL structures clean and when I say clean ideally you
33:20
want to make sure that whatever keyword you're trying to optimize that's the key word that's in included in the URL
33:27
nothing included that is not understandable so again going back to
33:32
our example how to become a digital marketing specialist it's very clean the title tag is the keyword The Meta
33:39
description is cleanly written has the keyword and then the URL is the other element that the end user can see and
33:46
that URL includes the keyword in it so after we've done those three elements
33:53
the title tag The Meta description and the URL then we want to start optimizing
33:58
the page itself so ideally when we say optimize the page itself the page
34:04
remember needs to be structured and when we say structured it needs to be structured in terms of you know headers
34:10
and subheaders and organized in a manner in which the end user can read the
34:15
article read the content clearly and concisely without being confused and so
34:21
that's the job of headers they add they add basically an organization relational structure to the content and with
34:28
headers there's a hierarchy so you have anywhere from H1 which is the top of the hierarchy to an H6 and so you're free to
34:36
use any one of those headers when building on a page in order to organize the content but ideally you probably
34:41
want to stick with an H1 or an H2 because those are at the top of the hierarchy and what those do is they
34:48
actually stress to Google that hey this header with this particular keyword in
34:53
it is important so if you use an H6 with the keyword in it it's telling Google
34:59
hey this is an H6 but it's not as important so an H1 and an H2 tag show
35:05
importance and so let's look at an example of what that is so here you could see an H1 is going to be at the
35:12
top of the hierarchy so that means it's going to be bigger and Bolder then you have an H2 which is going to be bigger
35:18
and Bolder than an H3 but not as big and bold as an H2 so with headers not only
35:24
are you organizing the content 10 accordingly but you're also signaling to Google how important that particular
35:31
header is and of course the header needs to include the keyword we're trying to rank for so let's take a look again at
35:38
that example so if we go to how to become a digital marketing specialist if I click on that page I can look at the
35:45
content and I can see that there are headers in here so the headers are there
35:51
to organize the content and that's what we want we want to be able to organize the content and if you look at the other
35:58
example I'm showing here how to become a digital marketing specialist a learning path Explorer you can see that's an H1
36:04
but below it's a subheader the growing digital marketing job market so that's an H2 and so we're not stressing to
36:12
Google that that's more important than nh1 but nonetheless we're stressing at Google that it's important nonetheless
36:18
so we want to be able to use headers we want to be able to use keywords in our headers in order to stress to Google
36:25
what's important and also to organize the content because Google likes content
36:30
organized okay the next element we want to focus on is internal linking and so
36:36
internal link you never remember earlier in the presentation it's basically links
36:42
from one page on your website to another and so here we can see on this
36:47
particular article how to become a digital marketing specialist there's also links to other pages on simply
36:55
learns website and so for this particular content it also links to SEO
37:01
specialist PPC specialist social media marketing Specialists and digital marketing specialist so the whole idea
37:08
behind internal linking is to link from one page to another where it's relevant and in this case it's relevant because
37:15
we're talking about how to become a digital marketing specialist that's what the whole content is about and so what
37:21
simply learns doing here is offering up other pages on their web website that are relevant to becoming a digital
37:28
marketing specialist and so this is a best practice when you're optimizing a web page so you want to be able to have
37:36
internal linking on your site and the whole idea behind internal linking is it
37:41
also allows users to navigate through the site naturally so when I say naturally they don't always have to
37:47
refer back to the top navigation they can naturally and seamlessly go from one
37:53
relevant article or page to another and so that's the whole idea behind link building and internal link building it
37:59
allows Google to identify you know pages that they want to crawl and index
38:06
because they're linked to one another but it also helps the end user because it allows the end user to go from one
38:12
page to another and it's signaling to Google hey this particular page is linked to this page so we're going to
38:18
also index that page and so that's the whole important part of internal linking
38:24
it's about the end you user experience and it's about allowing Google to find
38:29
the pages on your website so they can crawl them and index them so you can be
38:34
ranked for them and so also in addition to internal linking we want to be able
38:40
to use natural language and so what do I mean by natural language or natural
38:45
language processing so what Google does is in terms of natural language processing they're looking for the
38:51
content and the keyword it needs to be relevant so when your website is about digital marketing you don't necessarily
38:58
want to rank or try to rank for the keyword digital marketing one it's too broad two there might be some
39:05
competition but three you're probably not going to write something as broad like digital marketing so ideally what
39:11
you want to do is you want to choose other relevant related keywords that's going to be more natural and so that's
39:18
what we mean on natural language processing we want to choose keywords that are more natural to the content
39:23
you're writing so instead of the key or digital marketing maybe we want to talk about the types of digital marketing or
39:30
digital marketing examples or what is a digital marketing strategy or how to become a digital marketing specialist so
39:36
those are all relevant keywords to digital marketing and more relevant to the content because if you try to rank
39:44
for the keyword digital marketing again it's probably going to be a little bit broad probably more competition and not
39:50
as relevant to your content and as a result probably not a good user experience so think about some other
39:56
keywords that you could optimize and rank for and that goes back to the keyword research that's why the keyword
40:03
research is so important because it allows us to identify other keywords and
40:09
the natural language process what keywords are more relevant for the content and then another element to
40:15
on-page SEO is the sitemap and so with a site map it's basically a list of all
40:22
the pages on your website and the whole idea of listing all the pages on your
40:27
website in one document is it helps both users and search engines understand the
40:33
structure of your website so there are two types of sitemaps one's an HTML sitemap and that's designed for humans
40:40
so if you have a website with a lot of content at the footer or the bottom of
40:45
your web page you probably want to have a link to sitemap so if somebody clicks
40:51
on that side map they're going to be able to see all the pages on your website structured in an organized
40:56
manner well an XML sitemap and XML is just a different format it's designed
41:01
for crawlers and so the whole idea remember is Google likes to crawl content when they crawl content they
41:08
bring it back to their servers and index it and so we want to be able to create a sitemap for Google or other search
41:15
engine crawlers and so XML is the format so let me show you example of how that
41:20
looks so if I go to simplylearn.com and simply type in say sitemap.xml just as
41:28
an example I'm going to get this particular page in this particular page displays two XML sitemaps so these site
41:36
maps are there for Google to go ahead and crawl and nothing more than a list
41:41
of all the pages on your website and so this is a quick and easy way for Google
41:46
to get a hold of all those pages so that they can index them and that's the whole idea behind SEO you want to be able to
41:54
have Google index all the content you want to be found for for the keyword you
41:59
want to be found for so it all starts with the sitemap so let's go from on-page SEO which in recap is basically
42:07
optimizing certain elements on your website so that you are relevant for a
42:13
particular keyword and that meant updating the title tag The Meta description the URL the headers choosing
42:21
the right keywords to put into the content having internal linking chain and also updating the sitemap well those
42:28
are elements that you can do on your website so we're going to switch gears and talk about a different strategy
42:34
off-page SEO because without on page or off page you can't have a page ranking
42:40
so the two work together so you can do as much as you want on on page but you still need off-page SEO and you could do
42:47
all the off-page SEO you want but you still need on page so both of these strategies have to be in full effect in
42:54
order for you to rank so let's now switch gears to off-page SEO and so
42:59
off-page SEO is simply the process of linking or promoting your website using
43:05
link building and so if you remember I talked about this earlier on there's two
43:10
types of links internal and external linking and so for on-page SEO we used
43:15
internal linking for off-page SEO we're going to talk about external linking and
43:21
external linking allows us to improve our website sites recognition or
43:26
relevancy or credibility and why do we want to improve our relevancy and credibility and trustworthiness and
43:32
Authority because we want Google to know that our web page is trustworthy it is
43:38
recognized by other websites and it is relevant for a particular keyword and so if we can do that using off-page SEO
43:46
methods then Google's going to rank our web page for the keyword we want to be found for so it's really off-page SEO is
43:54
synonymous with link building and there's plenty of opportunities to do link building it just comes down to
43:59
creating a strategy so again some of the benefits to off page well we talked
44:04
about you know being credible and trustworthiness and relevant we need to do that in order to rank but there's
44:11
some other benefits there so if we're have a link on another credible website
44:16
then it's likely going to increase the traffic to our own website it also creates high domain Authority and so
44:23
what I mean by high domain Authority is if we have basically links to other web
44:28
pages pointing back to us then basically our domain Authority is going to improve
44:34
and when our domain Authority improves other websites are going to want to link to us so the higher authoritative we are
44:40
for our website than other web pages are going to want to link to us and so the
44:45
more external linking we have the higher the domain Authority so it all starts with linking to other high domain
44:53
Authority websites so linking to a high domain Authority website for example
44:58
having a link on Wikipedia that points back to our web page creates high domain
45:04
Authority for us and it helps Drive traffic so some of the other benefits of off-page SEO are in credibility so if
45:13
we're linking from Wikipedia to our web page it does create credibility for us it also helps us increase our page rank
45:20
so remember that external linking helps build domain Authority helps build credibility
45:26
trustworthiness and it's going to in turn help us rank for that particular page and then certainly not last having
45:33
a good off-page SEO link building strategy increases our brand awareness because if we're on other high Authority
45:41
websites Wikipedia or say a social platform it's going to increase our
45:46
brand awareness and increasing our brand awareness increases our trustworthiness
45:52
and so if somebody is looking to say become a digital marketing specialist then likely instead of typing in digital
45:59
marketing specialist on Google they might type in our brand name in this case simply learn and so these are all
46:05
the benefits to off-page SEO so it's nothing more than having links on other
46:12
websites that are pointing back to ours and again there's lots of benefits its
46:18
drives helps Drive traffic and increases our Authority so those are things that we want to take advantage of when we
46:24
want want to rank and the key behind off-page SEO or link building is always
46:31
going to be content so from an on-page SEO perspective having quality content
46:37
allows that content to be optimized for Relevant keyword and ranked but also
46:42
from an off-page SEO strategy having high quality content allows us to have
46:48
other sites and it doesn't necessarily have to be a website it could be a social platform or it can be another
46:54
blogging platform or blogging website link back to ours why because the content is original it's natural it's
47:01
well structured it reads well and so that's the whole idea behind off page you can't have links on other websites
47:09
if you don't have quality content so one of the ideas behind off-page SEO is not
47:15
only do you want to create good content but you probably want to spend a lot of time or a bit of time on others websites
47:21
so remember the example I used earlier in this presentation about having an ice cream blog and ice cream recipes well it
47:28
probably wouldn't be a bad idea to say spend some time on other blogs related to desserts related to cakes related to
47:36
food in general related to vegetables or other items that people could link from
47:43
so the whole idea is understanding who else is out there who has relevant content that you could share so you
47:51
could share your content with them they can share their content with you and generally that's how it works naturally
47:56
anyway in the web sphere if somebody likes your content they're going to link to it they don't necessarily have to
48:03
wait for you to ask them but it might not be a bad idea to understand who else is out there that has content somewhat
48:09
of yours so that you can you know get a link on that particular website or blog post and so some other ideas behind
48:16
having external links pointing back to your website is social media so social
48:22
media is not just Facebook or Twitter but it expands beyond that there's
48:27
there's core there's media there's all sorts of content generated websites like
48:32
Reddit so the list goes on and on you just need to find what's relevant for your content if it's relevant for your
48:39
content then it's worth putting or trying to get the external link on that social media platform and then again
48:46
going back to my ice cream blog recipes blog post yeah if you find a particular
48:51
blog that you want to have an external link on there's nothing wrong with reaching out to that particular blogger
48:58
you know in some cases very flattering but in other cases if the content is relevant then why not it's only going to
49:04
help your end user experience if you add somebody who has a say a Blog about
49:10
cakes having their link on your blog post so there's nothing wrong with it because it also adds to the user
49:17
experience and if you're going to ask somebody to put an external link on theirs you might want to be open-minded
49:23
and make sure that you're are able and willing to put an external link on your
49:29
blog post or website pointing to their content that's how the web Works especially if the contents of quality
49:35
relevant and of good nature okay so let's move on and finish up with the
Do's and Don'ts in SEO
49:40
do's and don'ts of SEO so we talked a lot about why SEO what is SEO how do we
49:47
rank for SEO what is on page SEO what is off-page SEO and so let's just wrap up
49:54
with some of the things you again want to do to rank your page for a particular keyword and some of the things you don't
50:00
want to do so the first thing on the list is optimize for white hat techniques and what I mean for opting in
50:08
for white hat techniques is basically everything I just mentioned today you want to do keyword research you want to
50:15
choose a natural language processing form format so you could choose keywords
50:20
that are going to be relevant natural to the content and you don't want to opt for black cat techniques and blad hat
50:26
techniques are probably not even worth going into detail but one example is choosing a keyword arbitrarily like say
50:33
digital marketing and just stuffing that keyword into the content so that's probably not something you want to do
50:39
because again it's not going to be good for the end user so stay away from black hat and focus on some of the techniques
50:46
we talked about in today's presentation the other do we want to do is get backlinks from relevant sites so that's
50:54
off page SEO again it's what I mentioned earlier it's about linking your quality
50:59
content to another person's website that also has quality content we don't want
51:05
to have a backlink from an irrelevant site why because it's not going to be relevant and it's also going to hurt our
51:10
Authority because if it's on a site that's not of good quality then Google's going to look at us and say well this
51:17
site is linking to your site but it's not relevant so therefore you know we're not going to look at you in this same
51:25
way as if you were on a quality website we do want to use our keywords naturally because title tags are what people see
51:32
first on organic search but you don't want to use the same title tag on every
51:37
page of your website so we want to stay away from doing that so you want to have a unique title tag for every web page on
51:45
your website and ideally what does that mean that means using our keyword research to choose one of two keywords
51:52
per page and optimizing your web page for those one to two keywords so you
51:58
ideally what you want to do is have one or two different keywords for every page on your website we definitely definitely
52:05
definitely want to write engaging content so the content should be
52:11
engaging remember user experience we want users to stay on our website we
52:16
want them to enjoy the content that they're reading and we want them to go from one page to another naturally we
52:22
definitely don't want to leverage or plagiarize or just copy content from others websites because it's not one
52:29
probably going to be relevant to what you're writing about two it's duplicate content and it's somebody else's so
52:36
that's a black cat Technique we want to stay away from I can't emphasize this enough we need to do keyword research
52:43
first before you do anything else you need to find relevant keywords and not only that you need to understand the
52:50
volume and the competition for each of those keywords okay you don't want to choose a key word that has low volume
52:56
High competition you want to choose a keyword that has high volume low
53:02
competition but above all you want to choose keywords that are relevant to
53:07
your content we want to avoid keyword stuffing so don't take a keyword and just stuff it everywhere on the page
53:14
it's not going to be natural and Google's going to be able to pick up on that so we want to maintain some level
53:20
of quality with our content and quality with the keyword that we choose so
53:25
reminder when you have quality content it's always going to link internally to
53:31
another page on your website with quality content but it's got to be natural and don't just build site-wide
53:37
backlinks meaning don't just have an internal link to the home page or don't
53:42
have every page on your website linking to just one page so internal linking
53:48
should be natural naturally linking from one page to another not only does it help Google understand and crawl all the
53:56
web pages on your website but it's good for the end User it's good user experience and certainly last but
54:04
something I didn't talk about does take time to rank your content so remember the process you're going to write your
54:11
content you're going to choose keywords you're going to change the elements on that page for those keywords and all the
54:18
while you're going to make sure Google can crawl that content and when they crawl they're going to index it the
54:23
process to takes time especially if you choose a keyword that's competitive so just be patient if you have quality
54:29
content and you've optimized for on-page SEO and off-page SEO then you will rank
54:36
for that keyword and then make sure your website's user friendly and mobile friendly so we talked about responsive
54:43
content earlier so remember most users today start the process of search on
54:49
mobile so we want to make sure your websites are mobile friendly on-page
On Page SEO
54:54
optimization as the name suggests is the practice of optimizing web pages to rank
55:00
higher and get relevant traffic from the search engine on-page optimization includes both
55:07
content and HTML source code optimization search engine optimization
55:13
can be very complex so when you're trying to understand it for the first time I find it very easy just to break
55:19
it up into general concepts that you might already have an understanding of when you look at the hundreds of signals
55:25
that go into SEO they can be broken up into either relevancy or because
55:30
sometimes it's both popularity so relevancy and popularity out of all
55:35
these signals they fit into one of these two things we're going to break all the signals we have into these two areas in
55:42
this section we're going to talk about the on-page factors that's because these are the factors that you have direct
55:48
impact upon and you can make a small tweak and have a big impact with Organic
55:54
traffic with your on-page relevancy factors the primary on-page relevancy
56:00
factors that I'll cover in this lesson are title tags and meta description header tags which are used for headlines
56:07
and subheadings website URLs and URL structure image alt text internal links
56:14
keyword usage and sitemaps let's start with one of my favorites and
56:19
that is the title tag this is also called a page title the page title is
Title Tags - On Page SEO Techniques
56:25
not shown on the page now rather it is displayed on the browser Tab and this is
56:30
what makes it highly important is that in addition to being displayed on the browser tab it is also the title tag or
56:38
the page title that is shown on the text in the Google search results as the link
56:43
to the page the page title influences both the click-through rates and people's first
56:49
impressions of our website next up we have the meta description
56:54
Now The Meta description can be a bit confusing The Meta description is in the code and
Meta Description - On Page SEO Techniques
57:00
it does not influence rankings but it does influence clicks
57:06
people will see your snippet or your page information in the search engine
57:13
results that gray text is the meta description if you don't have a meta description
57:19
then it may pull information from the page you can affect this and improve the
57:27
chances of your meta description appearing if you write a short descriptive phrase of the content or the
57:32
purpose of the page and just because we edit these elements does not guarantee that they will show
57:37
up I often say that we affect the change but we cannot control it
57:43
this is because the search engine May override your changes and show different content in these areas
57:49
sometimes it may help and it might be a better description but many times it's
57:54
not now let's go to the next element the header tags these are also referred to
Header Tags - On Page SEO Techniques
58:01
as the heading and subheading and this is how HTML was built when the
58:07
web was first created it enables a logical hierarchy of
58:12
content so starting with the headline then displaying a subheading and then
58:18
subheadings after that the idea here is that you're establishing a hierarchy of information
58:25
so you start with the H1 like a newspaper there's only one main headline
58:31
per page it describes the main purpose of the page then a subheading the H2 this is how you
58:40
break the sub content into subcategories obviously you'll want to use a keyword
58:45
in there as well you see by describing the purpose of the page in the headline and then again in a
58:52
subheading you're naturally going to use your primary and secondary keywords
58:57
because you're going to associate them with the product or the purpose and the benefit
59:03
the key is to keep it short you see after the headline are the
59:08
subcategories the H2S and then your H3 is typically used as a paragraph heading
59:14
now putting the keyword in these headings alone does not make your page optimized
59:19
remember the purpose is to provide a quick reference for people to find the content they need within seconds
59:27
so short explanatory heading and subheadings paragraph headings are very
59:32
effective and naturally you'll be using keywords to help people locate the information
59:38
that is most important to them now if we go back to the search engine results page the serp there is another
URL and URL Structure - On Page SEO Techniques
59:46
element in that listing the page title is the large Blue text The Meta description is the gray text now the
59:53
green text is the URL of the page that is listed this is the address of the page just like the address for your home
1:00:00
the internet knows that the URL is the address for that page this is extremely
1:00:05
important for SEO for a variety of reasons the most important though is your keyword usage I like to make sure
1:00:13
that I have at least one Relevant Word in the URL now also here keep it short
1:00:19
one of the worst things you can do is have a URL full of keywords or even worse hyphenate them all remember people
1:00:26
use these urls they provide context for the page people
1:00:31
also copy and paste URLs into Mobile messages emails and Social Links so it
1:00:37
is extremely important to keep these short succinct and I like to say readable
1:00:43
now I've just briefly touched about the importance of the URL and now let's look
1:00:48
at the URL structure first let's start with the primary core of the URL the domain name
1:00:56
in the example with the URL I have here example.com that's the domain name so
1:01:02
this is the first thing that people see with your online business now be on the internet this is going to
1:01:09
be what's in all of your ads emails brochures business cards and online your
1:01:14
social profiles all of your marketing efforts are going to drive people to this domain there's a lot of advice
1:01:21
about buying or using domains that have your keywords in them and unfortunately domains have been being sold for decades
1:01:28
so there's less chance of finding a domain with the keywords you want now the search engines don't make the
1:01:34
keyword used in the domain a primary ranking signal so that's good however the domain is your business it needs to
1:01:41
be memorable if you have a very I call it a spammy looking domain name with
1:01:46
multiple words and hyphens or one that's hard to spell or confusing people are
1:01:52
going to make an initial impression off of that so make sure you have something that's going to make a great first
1:01:57
impression here's the rule for a domain name something that's easy to spell and
1:02:03
easy to pronounce ideally sure it's something you can type and share some something you're going to be able to put
1:02:09
on a business card and be proud of not something that you bought primarily because you want it for SEO reasons and
1:02:16
you think with that you're going to succeed as an example just think about Amazon their domain name says nothing
1:02:21
about books and yet it grew to be one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world the same with Alibaba or Google
1:02:28
their domain names were not the keyword but their marketing and branding built
1:02:34
their company now everything after the domain is a subdirectory this is based on your website organization as an
1:02:40
example if you have a website selling shoes then the subdirectory can be called shoes it's easy right the sub
1:02:48
directory is the folder that contains the relevant files or Pages for that group think of a file folder with
1:02:54
documents inside the file folder is usually based on a major category of content or products now inside the
1:03:00
folder are individual documents or Pages these files or Pages usually come after
1:03:06
the subdirectory in this example you see the file.html the next step in
1:03:11
optimizing the URL is to name the page in a way that explains the content of the page to use our eCommerce shoe
1:03:18
website a page name would usually be a specific product name this way you would end up with domain name forward slash
1:03:26
shoes as the category forward slash brand name running shoe insert that here
Image Alt Text - On Page SEO Techniques
1:03:32
if you've ever looked at the HTML that make up the instructions of the page you'll understand a bit more of how
1:03:38
search engines get the information from the page the text on the page and the markup such as the headings provide
1:03:45
instructions as to where the text is located the importance and prominence of the text in addition to the arrangement
1:03:52
of the overall page HTML is a set of instructions for a browser to assemble
1:03:58
the page and the search engines use that as well now the search engines spiders cannot see images as the internet
1:04:05
developed many attributes were added to provide for accessibility and additional features users that are site impaired
1:04:13
cannot see images and the alternative text tag describes
1:04:19
the image further there are many times when our bandwidth isn't strong and not all of
1:04:25
the images will load in that case we need the alt text description to provide
1:04:30
the context of the image and its purpose search engines use this alt text
1:04:35
description to gain additional context about the page the content of the image
1:04:40
and its purpose now we have an entire section on links but at this point I
Internal Links - On Page SEO Techniques
1:04:45
just want to cover internal links an internal link is a link from one page on your website to another page of your own
1:04:53
website now this is important from a relevancy perspective you'll see internal links in your main
1:04:59
navigation you'll likely have a link that says home one that says contact us or about our
1:05:07
company what you're showing to search engines and to humans is that this section if
1:05:13
you click on this link is about our company or this is where you find our
1:05:18
contact information you see these links are not votes like external links however they provide
1:05:25
relevance and context to the information on your own website
1:05:30
let's dive in a little more on keywords when a search engine crawls and
Keyword Usage - On Page SEO Techniques
1:05:36
processes your website it doesn't simply look for the instances of specific keywords
1:05:42
it's a lot more complex than that it's using a technology called natural language processing
1:05:49
natural language processing uses algorithms to try to understand the meaning of text
1:05:56
you see search engine processing is attempting to be human this is the same way that people see and
1:06:02
hear the words and we're using the words to find the meaning expressed in the words
1:06:08
similarly when a search engine goes to your website it may see keywords but it's looking for the context of those
1:06:14
words you may say football but just having the word football repeated throughout your
1:06:19
website isn't going to help you rank specifically for football what you need to do and what is more
1:06:25
common in actual human conversation happens very naturally
1:06:30
when we talk about football we use naturally additional words such as goal
1:06:36
and referee and World Cup you see Google and the other search engines are going to take these into account
1:06:42
by usage of other synonyms and other common words you present the context of
1:06:47
a bigger broader idea for your website the next site signal that we have is
Sitemaps - On Page SEO Techniques
1:06:53
site Maps now there are two kinds of site Maps there's the site map that is
1:06:58
for humans and there is the site map that are for search engine robots crawlers or spiders
1:07:05
the one that is for human is called an HTML sitemap you've probably seen these
1:07:11
before the link is generally in the footer of a website if you click on it it shows you the major sections of the
1:07:18
website provide some search functionality but looking at it as a
1:07:23
human it shows you the hierarchy of the website and where to find important information
1:07:28
it shows how everything fits together now there's something else that exists
1:07:34
called an XML sitemap it's not linked from any page of your website but exists as an independent
1:07:40
file on your server now this is something you can see but it
1:07:46
is formatted for search engine spiders using a programming language called XML
1:07:52
it shows the hierarchy and the priority of each of the URLs of the website every
1:07:57
page every document every image and it also shows the date that each page was
1:08:03
last updated or changed so at this point we've covered a lot of things that are important and things
Onpage Do's and Don'ts
1:08:10
that you should be doing when optimizing your on-page content now let's go a different direction and
1:08:16
cover things that you should not be doing keyword stuffing hidden text repetitive anchor text and cloaking the
1:08:24
first one is keyword stuffing now back in the early days of search engine optimization people used to increase the
1:08:31
instances of words on the page now this is well before natural language processing at that time search engines
1:08:38
were looking for occurrences of specific words well search engines they're very
1:08:43
smart about this what may have worked 20 years ago or 10 years ago keyword stuffing does not work
1:08:50
you're not going to rank better for any given phrase by including it a dozen or more times on the page in fact you might
1:08:58
get an over optimization penalty by constantly repeating the same word over
1:09:03
and over focus on writing content that engages with your visitors and uses
1:09:09
language naturally now the next one is hidden text unfortunately I still see
1:09:14
this this is when you write content that is solely for search engines and not for people now typically it is attempted by
1:09:22
writing a lot of repetitive keywords as text coloring it white and placing it
1:09:27
against a white background as you see this was developed as another way to add more keyword stuff text without the user
1:09:34
seeing the overuse of keywords now it didn't work too well in the past and it definitely does not work today
1:09:41
this tactic backfires in two ways first search engines can tell when it's white
1:09:47
text on a white background it's easy to tell from a computer science point of view search engines read the HTML and in
1:09:54
the HTML are the instructions for colors when you hide text modern search engines
1:10:00
are smart enough to figure it out probably better than a human now secondly it's done to hide repetitive
1:10:06
keyword stuff text which is the second thing against you these outdated unprofessional tactics will most likely
1:10:14
get a website penalized by the search engines the next one is repetitive anchor text
1:10:20
you may have followed a link to a page when looking for a business or information and instead of the
1:10:25
information you want you get a page that doesn't feel like it was written for people
1:10:30
every sentence is redundant repetitive and almost every keyword is linked even
1:10:36
when there doesn't need to be a link it confuses the flow of the information on the page now again this used to be a
1:10:43
tactic that sometimes would work but it's no longer helpful
1:10:48
search engines and their natural language processing algorithms have advanced significantly they can tell
1:10:54
when something's not readable when something is probably intended for machines and rankings but not for people
1:10:59
search engines will figure it out please don't waste time on redundant links trying to inflate the relevance of your
1:11:06
links and Pages the last thing to cover here is cloaking cloaking is the idea of
1:11:12
showing one thing to the search engines and something entirely different to humans now this is related to the rest
1:11:18
of the tactics I just covered it's something that used to work but it was expressly against the search engine
1:11:25
guidelines while it may have worked if the search engine is discovered it on your website you could have been
1:11:31
penalized or dropped from the search engine results entirely now we've covered all of the most important
How Perfectly Optimized Page Looks Like?
1:11:37
on-page optimization factors let's take a look at what the theoretically perfectly optimized page would look like
1:11:43
in this example we can see many of these elements being used together you can also see that the base key phrase
1:11:50
digital camera is being repeated but always included with a specific contact
1:11:55
next first at the top of the page is the URL which has digital cameras in the
1:12:01
address the page title follows using the context of the information and adding the word
1:12:06
reviews you can also see at the top of the page that the main navigation and
1:12:11
secondary navigation also called the breadcrumb navigation provides context
1:12:16
of the Page's location within the entire website and natural keyword usage
1:12:22
the H1 headline is the key phrase but also happens to simply be the best title
1:12:28
for the content of the page subsequent subheadings provide additional information such as ratings
1:12:35
recommendations and features the links provide relevant ways to
1:12:40
access additional content the image utilizes alt text there are also clear
1:12:46
calls to action which provide relevant offers to visitors as you can see the context of all of the
1:12:53
content is very strong and sends a clear relevancy signal to both search engines
1:12:58
and readers to conclude this section I'd like to cover the top influencing factors now
1:13:06
sometimes you may find these as lists but I found it a bit more practical to separate them into categories
1:13:13
typically every year you'll find these collections of lists from surveys experts or speculation
1:13:20
some are from testing but honestly you can't ever truly test a search engine as
1:13:26
they change a little bit with every algorithm so the best thing is to take from these
1:13:31
lists these factors that are the tried and true factors over the years that
1:13:36
have worked consistently also those tactics that not only make your website more effective with users
1:13:43
they tend to do well with search engines so if a tactic serves that Dual Purpose
1:13:48
it's a good tactic so these are not exclusive and have to lists for every situation but guides and
1:13:57
indicators for you to use the top on-page factors from surveys opinions
1:14:02
and data are these a relevant page title page headings
1:14:07
anchor text links a keyword-based URL a keyword or contextual file name such
Top On Page SEO Ranking Factors
1:14:15
as page name image name or PDF file name alt text and images and finally what you
1:14:22
do with the content on a page to make it more readable lists bullet points and
1:14:27
bolded text the top factors for off-page linking tend to contain these items
1:14:34
the total number of domains linking to you the number of Highly influential domains
1:14:40
linking to you the number of unique domain IP addresses
1:14:46
the total backlinks without no follow limits the total relevant anchor text in links
1:14:53
to you and finally the types and context of keywords in Anchor text links
1:15:01
the domain also contributes factors to your overall rankings such as the age of
1:15:06
the domain which would include ownership information such as the length of time owned and operated by a company
1:15:14
the real business information tied to that domain such as the business address being the same as the business
1:15:21
registration address for the domain in addition the signals from social
1:15:26
accounts driving visits to the domain functionally the search engines also
1:15:33
utilize some attribution based on the quality of programming of the website
1:15:38
for instance taking care of the basic search engine Protocols of the
1:15:44
robots.txt file XML sitemap and https protocol
1:15:50
websites that Implement these features have shown that they are familiar with search engine guidelines and protocol
1:15:57
now one of the changes over the past few years has been the implementation of page speed as an increasing ranking
1:16:05
Factor slow loading pages with a lot of extraneous code that slow the delivery
1:16:10
of the page will be penalized as they take away from the user experience
1:16:16
optimizing the page code speeding up the load time of the page can directly
1:16:22
impact your rankings and this is closely related to the mobile friendliness of your website
1:16:27
if your website is not mobile friendly it will be limited in visibility as
1:16:32
Google's primary index is focused on mobile devices and mobile delivery
1:16:38
behavioral factors are the newest factors and with the Advent of artificial intelligence it is making
1:16:44
determining the intent and the is making determinings easier for a search engine to derive a judgment
1:16:51
of relevancy based on interaction while the extent of these signals is not
1:16:57
fully known it is suspected that they are minor but growing in importance these include the amount of users that
1:17:05
search for a brand name business's name and go to that result showing brand
1:17:10
awareness also the amount of direct visits bypassing search
1:17:16
time on page pages per session which is also called the depth of visit
1:17:21
and lastly the behavior of a Searcher from the results page how many results
1:17:27
are clicked how many times do they return to the results this evaluation is looking to judge if
1:17:33
the results presented were satisfactory or deficient for that query so let's
Keyword Research in SEO
1:17:39
start with the why we would do keyword research so Jesse is planning to publish
1:17:45
a Blog of pizza recipes so she was doing pizza recipes step by step piece of
1:17:51
recipes with sausage homemade pizza toppings pizza dough recipes thin crust
1:17:57
pizzas she's doing a lot of different topics on pizza recipes well what Jesse
1:18:03
needs to do is understand what's going to drive traffic to these blog posts if she's writing about you know different
1:18:10
topics around pizza recipes so she's Unsure how these blogs are going to
1:18:17
drive traffic so she really needs to understand that hey you need to choose
1:18:23
the right keywords to drive traffic so the question is if you're writing a blog post about recipes with sausages is
1:18:30
pizza recipes with sausages or recipes for free the best keyword to use maybe
1:18:36
maybe not so you need to take uh care and shoes in the queue words to align
1:18:42
with your content so that's really the idea of why we would do keyword research because some of the issues with keywords
1:18:49
that are poorly chosen are they could have slow search volume for example you may choose a keyword that just a lot of
1:18:56
people aren't using to search for or they can be highly competitive so if you choose a keyword that's very broad or
1:19:02
popular it can be very competitive and take you a long time to be found for that keyword or you could just make the
1:19:09
mistake of choosing a keyword that is in aligned with your content or you can choose keywords but use them incorrectly
1:19:15
with your content so these are some of the issues that you can encounter if you just go about choosing keywords randomly
1:19:23
without due diligence without the proper research so low search volume will lead
1:19:28
to less traffic High competition session you may not even rank at all okay if somebody finds you for a keyword that's
1:19:36
not relevant to the topic they're just going to leave the page and if you're not using the right keywords and or if
1:19:43
you are using the right keywords and not using them correctly in the content then your pages may not even be found in
1:19:48
organic search so you really have to take care and choosing the keywords to me that's the most important step with
1:19:55
SEO is keyword research so we're going to talk about the types of keyword research then so we have short tail
Types of Keyword Research
1:20:02
keywords and we have long tail keywords so if you write a blog post about pizza recipes well what are you going to
1:20:08
choose a short tail or long tail so let's talk about short tail keywords first so short tail keywords are
1:20:15
keywords that are usually three keywords in a phrase or shorter in some cases it
1:20:21
may be two keywords in a phrase or shorter so short tip keywords usually have high search volume which means
1:20:27
likely means higher competition but what it all also means it could be lower
1:20:32
conversions because short sale keywords like for example pizza recipes could be considered a short choke heat word but
1:20:39
maybe somebody's looking for homemade pizza recipes or pizza recipes from their favorite Italian restaurant so
1:20:46
short taking words may not be as relevant so if we compare it with long tail keywords chances are you're going
1:20:52
to have lower competition that's one of the benefits but you're also going to have lower search volume but with longer
1:20:57
tail keywords the key word is probably going to be more relevant with the content you're writing about so
1:21:04
therefore the conversion rates likely going to be higher so that's really the difference between short-term keywords
1:21:09
and long tail keywords if you want to look at simplistically short tail keywords are Broad in nature it's going
1:21:15
to capture a lot of eyeballs but those eyeballs may look at your content as not relevant versus long tail keywords that
1:21:22
may be very relevant but not as many eyeballs on them so short tail keywords the characteristics they're not as
Short Tail Keywords
1:21:28
specific usually they're less than three words they have high search volume and
1:21:34
high competition so if you just choose pizza recipes could take you a while to rank for that keyword but when you rank
1:21:40
you're going to get the traffic but again it may not convert because the key word is Broad in nature so pizza recipes
1:21:46
is a short tail keyword that may not be exactly what you're writing about in
Long Tail Keywords
1:21:52
your blog post so it may draw a lot of traffic but the traffic may not do anything so the longer tail keywords are
1:21:59
very specific they consist of more than three words in the search query they have relatively low search volume
1:22:07
competition so the chance of you ranking higher faster for that long take word is
1:22:12
probably going to be greater because not many other websites are trying to rank for that same keyword and so the benefit
1:22:18
of that is if you have let's just say homemade pizza recipes with mushrooms
1:22:24
that's a long tail key word but if somebody's looking for that type of pizza recipe then you know know you're
1:22:31
going to track the right traffic and chances are that traffic's going to engage or convert based on the type of
1:22:38
conversion you have in place so example would be homemade pizza dough recipes that'd be another example more than
1:22:44
thick keywords in the phrase very specific we're talking about homemade pizza dough recipe so we're not talking
1:22:50
about just pizza recipes so it's a little bit more uh specific in nature longer tail so these keywords are used
1:22:57
for targeted Pages including blog posts if you're writing a blog post specifically about pizza recipes with
1:23:04
homemade dough then this is the key word you likely would want to use versus just pizza recipes so let's look at an
1:23:10
example between a short tail keyword and a long tail keyword and to accentuate
1:23:16
the differences we're going to use Google's Keyword Planner tool so
1:23:21
Google's keyboard Planner tool is located in Google ads the Google ads platform and when you're in the Google
1:23:28
ads platform you can simply click click on tools and then Keyword Planner and so what Keyword Planner allows us to do is
1:23:35
get a sense of the type of volume that a particular keyword has so what Google's
1:23:41
Keyword Planner does is they show you the average monthly searches this is the average monthly search volume of a
1:23:48
keyword over the past 12 months and so in this example we're going to choose pizza recipes and homemade pizza dough
1:23:55
recipes so one short tail and one long tail so we enter those keywords in we're going to click get results and what
1:24:02
Google's going to do is it's going to show us the volume of those keywords so
1:24:07
for pizza recipe we could see the average monthly search volume is 33 100
1:24:13
for pizza recipe so note that pizza recipe and pizza recipes are closely
1:24:20
related keywords and so what Google does is they consider that a close variance so meaning if somebody ties a piece of
1:24:27
recipe then they're also in Google's eyes looking for pizza recipes so it's a
1:24:33
close variance and so for the keyword pizza recipe which is short tail we
1:24:38
could see on average over the past 12 months this keyword received 33 100
1:24:43
queries and so if we hover over the graph we could see basically the volume
1:24:50
the average volume per month so here I could see for this particular keyword here the volume per month is 33 1000 and
1:24:57
then I could see the actual volume over the past 12 months and then for the long
1:25:03
tail keyword I can see homemade pizza dough recipe again close variants
1:25:08
homemade pizza dough recipes I can see over the past 12 months with the search volume is for this on average is 2400
1:25:15
but I could see here in December the volume went up to 3600 but for example
1:25:21
in May it was 1900. so it's gonna fluctuate a bit over the past 12 months
1:25:27
but on average it's about 2400 so shorter tail a lot more volume longer
1:25:34
tail not as much volume but nonetheless there is volume here and so these are
1:25:39
the difference between a short tail and a longer tail and so well Google's Keyword Planner also does is allow us to
1:25:46
get a sense of what the competition is and so here I can see the competition is low for both of these keywords fair
1:25:53
enough so we now know that if we want to optimize or choose the keyword homemade
1:25:59
pizza dough recipe for our blog post we know for ranked on page one of Google
1:26:04
even in the top spot we can expect about 2400 search queries for that keyword now
1:26:11
whether you get all 2400 clicks for that keyword remains to be seen chances are
1:26:16
you're not going to get all 2400 you're going to get a Lion's Share of those clicks but you're going to at least get
1:26:22
some volume on it so even the longer tick keywords have a lot of Promise because there is some search volume here
1:26:28
for this keyword how to do a proper keyword research so we looked at Google's Keyword Planner tool in Google
How To Do Keyword Research
1:26:35
ads and we typed in two keywords and we were able to get a sense of what the average volume is so we definitely want
1:26:43
to choose keywords based on the following factors we want to choose it based on search volume search volume is
1:26:49
a good indicator of the potential traffic we can obtain so again for the keyword homemade pizza dough recipe we
1:26:57
know that it averages 2400 a month in search volume again we may not get all
1:27:03
2400 but we're going to get a line share of that we also need to look at competition and so Google's Keyword
1:27:11
Planner gives us a high medium or low in terms of the competition but if you're
1:27:16
somebody who wants to get a better sense of what the competition is and you should because competition is a key
1:27:23
component in choosing keywords and so what I want to do is get a sense of how many people are actually optimizing for
1:27:29
that keyword so Google's Keyword Planner tool is going to give me a low medium high really what I want to do is get a
1:27:36
better sense of that numerically so what I can do is go into Google search and I
1:27:41
can type in pizza recipes and I could see there's about 1 billion results that's a lot of results however that
1:27:49
means that every potential web page out there on the internet that mentions
1:27:55
pizza recipes is going to be included in this number here and so I want to get a better sense of who's optimizing for
1:28:01
pizza recipes so I'm going to put in the all in title syntax and so what that is
1:28:07
going to ask Google to do is tell me all the websites that have pizza recipes the
1:28:13
keyword pizza recipes in the title tag so if I do all entitle colon space then
1:28:19
pizza recipes my result drops down to 336 000. so what that tells me is that
1:28:26
there are 336 000 results with the keyword pizza recipes in the title tag now if I want
1:28:33
to focus in on my other keyword if I choose my other keyword was a longer
1:28:38
tail keyword homemade pizza dough recipe so if I type that keyword in the homemade pizza dough recipe or recipes
1:28:46
remember close variance and I just click enter or type the keyword in hit my
1:28:52
Enter key I'm going to get 35 Million results but again is that really an
1:28:58
indicator of the type of competition I have no because every listing that mentions homemade pizza dough recipes is
1:29:05
going to be included in the search results so I'm going to type in my all in title colon space and then I'm going
1:29:11
to get a better sense of how many websites have the keyword homemade pizza
1:29:16
dough recipes in the title tag and I get 2160 different results so here I can see
1:29:23
the first result in the title tag homemade pizza dough recipe second one homemade pizza dough recipe so these are
1:29:29
are sites or web pages that have that keyword in the title tag so now I have a
1:29:34
numerical number to work with and so the thing you have to understand about SEO specifically about keyword research is
1:29:41
you need to do research on a few different keywords not just one or two so what we want to do is have a
1:29:49
spreadsheet the spreadsheet is going to contain keywords that we can potentially want to optimize for choose as keywords
1:29:57
to optimize for SEO and so my recommendation is you come up with a theme first so the theme for us in this
1:30:04
exercise is pizza recipes and so that's our theme so we chose the keyword pizza
1:30:10
recipes so the close variance here is pizza recipe what was the volume well we
1:30:16
know the volume was 33 100 for pizza recipe so what are we going to do we're going to put that number in in our
1:30:22
volume column what was the competition well if we go back and type in pizza
1:30:28
recipes it was 680 three thousand so I'm going to type in 683
1:30:34
000. what was our next keyword well it was pizza or homemade pizza dough recipes so if I go back for this
1:30:41
particular keyword is 2400 so I'm going to put 2400 in under my volume column and then what was my competition well my
1:30:48
competition was I typed that keyword back in 2160. so I'm gonna put two thousand one
1:30:55
hundred and sixty so now I have an idea of what kind of volume and what kind of
1:31:01
competition I have now you want to do this for a number of different keywords and when you do it for a number of
1:31:06
keywords what you do want to do is obviously choose a relevant keyword that has high volume and low competition so
1:31:14
another way of saying it is the volume or ratio of volume to competition and so
1:31:20
basically what we could do is take volume divided by competition if I make that a percentage I can see it's point
1:31:27
three five percent is the ratio between volume the competition if I do the same for my longer tail keyword 2400 divided
1:31:34
by 2160 I can see that 111 so this just
1:31:40
kind of proves the point that yeah I'm still going to get some volume but I have a better chance of ranking for this
1:31:45
longer tier keyword homemade pizza dough recipes so you want to be able to do that for a number of keywords and
1:31:51
examine the volume the competition and the ratio between volume and competition for your themed keywords in this case
1:31:59
pizza recipes so relevancy you want to choose keywords that are very relevant
1:32:04
to the content that you're writing and then again commercial intent what keywords are going to drive more
1:32:10
conversions and revenue for the business so when we talk about commercial intent we're talking about you know are you
1:32:16
choosing keywords that are going to get somebody to do what you want them to do so we could say You Know download pizza
1:32:23
dough recipes so somebody's typing in the keyword download pizza dough recipes then chances are they're going to find
1:32:31
you come to your side and take action by downloading that pizza dough recipe so you want to be able to also think about
1:32:38
the intent of the key word is it going to help you drive conversions and revenue if you're an e-commerce site so
1:32:44
search volume is the average monthly search volume made for a particular keyword and phrase so we can get that
1:32:52
number using Google's Keyword Planner tool in the Google ads platform we want
1:32:57
to Target keywords with high search volume that will help bring traffic to the website we want volume but we want
1:33:04
to take into account seasonality as well so that's where the Google's Keyword Planner tool comes in place because if
1:33:09
we go back again we can just hover over we can get a sense of any particular
1:33:15
Trend going on or season out so for example if I saw a large growth in the
1:33:20
winter months and not much volume growth in the summer months then that might
1:33:25
indicate to me that this keyword is more popular during the wintertime time so pay attention to the grass that you know
1:33:32
the Keyword Planner tool gives you use them to your advantage to take into account seasonality so a good example
1:33:39
would be funny Halloween costumes well we know that for Halloween you're going
1:33:44
to have a spike probably towards the end of September all the way through October and then it's going to drop after
1:33:52
October 31st which is Halloween so that's an example but in the case of pizza recipes you know you may find that
1:33:58
more people are choosing to search for pizza recipes during maybe the summer
1:34:04
months versus the winter months so pay attention to seasonality it will affect search volume so competition based on
1:34:11
our example it's one of the most important key metrics you don't want to choose a key word that's highly
1:34:16
competitive because if it's competitive then it's going to be harder to rank number one or even on page one of Google
1:34:24
depending on competitive it is so high search for I Am low competition in other
1:34:29
words is the ratio between the two is the ideal combination so going back to
1:34:34
the spreadsheet recommend you have that spreadsheet handy put your theme in place okay theme pizza recipes we use
1:34:41
Google's Keyword Planner tool to find the volume we use the all entitled syntax to find the competition so we
1:34:49
entered both of those numbers in and we get our ratio and so when you have these numbers for a number of different
1:34:55
keywords you want to be able to choose that ratio of high volume low competition but always relevancy always
1:35:03
trumps ratio so always go with a key word that is going to be relevant to
1:35:08
your content don't choose a keyword that's not relevant if you choose a keyword that's not relevant it's not
1:35:14
going to bode well for user engagement so the difficulty of a keyword ranges
1:35:19
from 0 to 100 in Google's keyword tool so it's going to be easy it's going to
1:35:25
be medium it's going to be hard but my recommendation is also to get the new numerical factor and that's the all in
1:35:32
title syntax and again relevancy is what drives the traffic to your website and
1:35:38
keep the traffic there on your website and also not only will keep the traffic on your website but hopefully get that
1:35:44
traffic to engage and convert so that's the key about relevancy you always want to choose keywords that are relevant to
1:35:51
your content even if it's sacrificing volume relevancy again trumps volume and
1:35:58
competition so always choose relevant keywords first so when you do that you're always almost guaranteeing that
1:36:05
at some point somebody's going to find your content because somebody out there might be looking for it and if they do
1:36:11
you're going to get found and then the engagement is going to be better so understand your business find keywords
1:36:17
that are relevant to your business and then focus on those keywords that'll help you with getting the right traffic
1:36:23
to your site always keep in mind the commercial intent so these keywords are more specific and result in conver
1:36:29
version rate for example buying is a good commercial intent keyword so if you
1:36:34
really want somebody to come to your website and buy then focus on those types of keywords in the case of the
1:36:39
pizza recipes maybe it's download could be our commercial intent keyword again there may be low search volume but those
1:36:47
are the type of keywords you want to focus on because that's the type of traffic you want to drive to your site
1:36:52
so some other examples a commercial intent keywords or discount deal your
1:36:58
coupon shipping you know don't be afraid to use some of these keywords as part of your longer tail keyword phrase again
1:37:05
the volume may not be high but the traffic quality is probably going to be better so keyword research is the
1:37:11
foundation for SEO so if you have chosen your keywords properly then if you do
1:37:17
get ranked for those keywords then it's going to lead to better engagement with
1:37:22
some conversions and so when we talk about keywords we also want to talk about our primary and secondary keywords
1:37:29
so every page should have at least a primary keyword and then a second carry
1:37:34
keyword to work with so primary keywords are really defining the nature of your content the secondary keywords are
1:37:41
relevant to the primary keyword so why do we choose a primary and secondary keyword because you may choose a keyword
1:37:48
as a primary keyword that is relevant to the content but may not necessarily rank
1:37:54
very high or have a lot of volume that's secondary keyword is also relevant to
1:37:59
the primary keyword but also relevant to content and you may rank for that secondary keyword so you always want to
1:38:05
go with two keywords versus just one keyword you want to give your yourself a chance to rank for at least two
1:38:11
different types of keywords of relevant nature so for web page there can be several secondary keywords but only one
1:38:18
primary keyword so your primary keyword is always going to be relevant to your content secondary keywords can be
1:38:24
relevant to the keyword but and you may have multiple secondary keywords but
1:38:30
it's also going to be related to the content and it gives you a better opportunity to be found between both the
1:38:35
primary and secondary and search Okay so let's take a look at another example of
1:38:41
how to use primary keywords and secondary keywords when choosing keywords so if our primary keyword is
1:38:48
healthy diet plan remember healthy diet plan is directly related to the content so that's what we're talking about but
1:38:55
these secondary keywords are also related to content and play off the primary keyword and so what we want to
1:39:01
do is go to cool Google's Keyword Planner tool and get an idea of the volume for healthy diet plan and then
1:39:09
also the volume and competition for some of these secondary keywords like healthy diet for weight loss healthy diet food
1:39:15
low carb diet healthy meal plans and diet plan weight loss so if I go in to
1:39:21
Google's Keyword Planner and type those keywords in I'm going to choose get results and now here I can see healthy
1:39:27
diet plan keyword I'm focusing on is my primary keyword has an average monthly
1:39:33
search volume of 9900 and then some of my secondary keywords healthy diet foods
1:39:38
diet plan weight loss low carb diet you know Google will give me a number of
1:39:44
different keywords to work with so I'm going to look at the search volume of those as well and so ideally what I want
1:39:50
to do is be able to then look at the volume and then look at the competition so healthy diet plan to go into my
1:39:58
keyword analysis here that's my theme so that's my keyword what's my volume for
1:40:03
healthy diet plan nine thousand nine hundred what's my competition so my
1:40:08
competition is seventy four thousand seven hundred and that's going to give me a ratio of volume to competition of
1:40:15
13 so that's what my content's about that's a considered a short tail keyword
1:40:20
because it has a lot of competition and so my ratio is 13 and what I want to do
1:40:26
is I want to be able to put these other secondary keywords it's in here as well maybe even go to a little longer tail
1:40:32
because I want to be able to find two key release two keywords I want to be
1:40:37
able to find my primary keyword that's relevant to my content and then I want to be able to find my secondary keyword
1:40:43
which is again related to the primary keyword which is also related to the content and so I want to be able to
1:40:49
choose two keywords basically and I want to choose two keywords that are relevant that have good ratio between volume and
1:40:56
competition so that's the whole idea again I'm how to do keyword research you want to be able to find your keywords
1:41:04
use the tools available to you and get a sense of what the volume is what the
1:41:10
competition is look at the ratio between the volume and competition and then based on the content choose that primary
1:41:16
keyword and then again based on the keyword you chose choose some secondary keywords as well because you want to be
1:41:22
found for not just one keyword but multiple keywords okay let's look at some alternative suggestions to key
1:41:29
keyword research so for doing keyword research we want to take into account
1:41:34
LSI keywords we could take into account other platforms that host a lot of
1:41:40
content like quora or Reddit we can use Google suggestions in the keyword search
1:41:46
bar we can use popular platforms like Wikipedia and we can use social media
1:41:51
bookmarking like Reddit so there are lots of suggestions that we can obtain
1:41:57
from various sources so let's start with LSI keywords and LSI stands for latent
1:42:03
semantic insect indexing and so basically what it is it's just keywords that I'll link to your primary keyword
1:42:09
and so when you're choosing keywords you always want to choose that primary keyword and then secondary keywords that
1:42:15
are similar to the primary keyword and usually those are LSI or latent semantic
1:42:21
indexing type keywords so they're used to drive relevant traffic to your page
1:42:27
so if you're focus in on one keyword we want to to have other keywords that are similar to increase our visibility on
1:42:33
the search engine result pages so we could find latent semantic indexing right in search so if we use the term
1:42:40
healthy diet if we go to Google search for example if I type in healthy diet and Google search all I need to do is
1:42:47
scroll to the bottom of the page and I can see searches related to healthy diet so healthy diet menu healthy diet essay
1:42:56
what does a healthy diet look like notice at the top Google's also given me some other suggestions here so they're
1:43:03
saying low-fat diet veganism gluten-free diet so there's lots of different
1:43:08
suggestions right in Google search bar so all of these are LSI related keywords
1:43:14
so if you're optimizing a page for a healthy diet then you could choose low-fat diet as a secondary keyword you
1:43:21
can use gluten-free diet as a secondary keyword it really depends on what the content is but you always want to
1:43:26
support your content with as much LSI keywords as possible so you can be found
1:43:32
for as many different keywords as possible in Google search so it's important because if you have a Blog
1:43:39
that you know talks about python so how do the search engines know if the website python is about the programming
1:43:46
language or the snake so Google for example uses LSI keywords to understand
1:43:51
what the page is specifically focusing on so if you're just focusing on Python and your content you want to support
1:43:58
that with LSI keywords and so that will allow your web page to better
1:44:03
communicate with Google also to have the visibility to show up on search so they can certainly improve your search
1:44:10
positioning and featured Snippets as well so if you have a keyword that
1:44:15
answers a question you could certainly found for feature snippet for example maybe you know healthy diet recipes if I
1:44:21
type that in you can see here there's a featured snippet so if I'm talking about recipes that's a key word I may want to
1:44:28
use and if I use that then Google has an opportunity to see what my content's
1:44:34
about and place my information at the top in this featured snippet you can also again see what some of the
1:44:40
questions are being asked what mails are good for weight loss what is a good healthy diet plan all of these can be
1:44:46
keyword phrases that you can use so the answers are right here in Google so Cora is a great platform because core is a
1:44:54
platform that people go and ask questions in a community responds with
1:45:00
answers or responses to that particular question or topic and so the great thing
1:45:06
about core is it's a good eye is a good place for you to go to get some ideas about a specific topic so if we're
1:45:14
talking about healthy dieting so we can find keywords with high search volume writing quora so the whole idea is you
1:45:21
can look at you know the top five questions for specific topic like healthy dieting and find relevant
1:45:27
keywords to healthy dieting so if you just type in that particular keyword in quora you're going to probably get some
1:45:33
responses to questions or responses to somebody else's question and so if we
1:45:39
take a look at core for example so if I just type in healthy dieting what I'm going to do is I'm going to get some
1:45:45
responses to the the topic healthy dieting so what's the best diet for Healthy Living what are the top five
1:45:51
tips for a healthy diet habit so all of these could be keyword phrases that you
1:45:57
could take away with for your own content and so the benefit here is you're getting kind of an idea of what's
1:46:02
trending what people are talking about and if you use tips for a healthy diet
1:46:08
habit for example and you optimize for that well again that could turn around and bode well for you because you could
1:46:14
be featured in Google as a featured snippet at the top here you can also turn around and use LSI related keywords
1:46:21
for healthy diet habits and you can simply just look for those LSI keywords right in Google remember at the bottom
1:46:28
or at the top up if I scroll down I could see some related LSI keywords at the bottom so writing Google as well you
1:46:36
could see in the Google search bar that Google provides some LSI related
1:46:41
keywords to your query so if I go back here and type in healthy diet recipes I
1:46:47
can see here Google's suggesting some other related keywords healthy diet menu healthy diet for men healthy diet foods
1:46:54
healthy diet for women so these are all LSI related keywords that you can use to
1:46:59
support your primary keyword and the content you're writing about so we've talked about LSI keywords where to find
1:47:06
them so they're found right here they can be found at the top of Google and they can be found at the bottom you can
1:47:11
also then go to core as well and get some ideas for the types of questions that are being asked so if you ask a
1:47:17
question and use that as your keyword phrase then again you have an opportunity of showing up for a featured
1:47:24
snippet in Google just by doing some additional research within Google itself or on quora so according to Google the
1:47:31
autocomplete predictions are automatically generated by Google's algorithm without any human intervention
1:47:37
it's based on a number of factors but the primary factor is how often past users have searched for terms so Google
1:47:44
collects all the keyword queries that somebody types in and they're suggesting some of the most popular terms that
1:47:51
people have typed in so if I go back to Google again if I start to type in recipes I could see some of the other
1:47:57
queries that somebody else has typed in or some of the most popular queries related to that topic so if you enter
1:48:03
the keyword healthy diet Google's going to suggest multiple keyword suggestions that users have asked in the past and
1:48:10
you could certainly get the search volume of those keywords just by looking in Google itself I can see for healthy
1:48:18
diet recipes billions of pages related to healthy diet recipes I can also get the search volume by going into Google's
1:48:26
Keyword Planner so if I type in healthy diet I'm gonna to be able to see what my search volume is for that keyword and in
1:48:33
addition I can see the seasonality of that particular keyword and in addition
1:48:38
to that Google's going to provide some other related keywords to my search query so if I'm looking for healthy diet
1:48:45
Google's going to suggest hey maybe you should choose healthy food or healthy eating or how to lose weight so those
1:48:51
are LSI related keywords that Google provides in the keyword plan which is
1:48:57
built into the Google ads platform another option for you is Wikipedia so Wikipedia is a vast platform of content
1:49:06
so we could turn Wikipedia into our own assets and use it to our own Advantage
1:49:12
by finding relevant keywords in an easy fashion so with Wikipedia we can
1:49:17
identify a list of keywords in The Meta description itself we could choose keywords from the first paragraph of
1:49:23
Wikipedia that has many relevant keywords or we could take a look at keywords from the Wikipedia content
1:49:28
section so we can also see additional Pages like the see also section that
1:49:34
gives relevant keywords that you're looking for we can also look at the references section as they contain
1:49:39
relevant keywords so go to Wikipedia as an example and I type in healthy diet
1:49:45
into Wikipedia here I can get just in the first paragraph alone I can see some
1:49:52
additional keywords that I might choose to use like micronutrients I never knew
1:49:57
that micronutrients was related to healthy diet but Wikipedia is providing some information about what
1:50:03
micronutrients is and maybe I can use that as a keyword an LSI related keyword
1:50:09
to my content so if I scroll down I get to see also section so it might give me some information food information
1:50:16
consumers for example dietary guidelines I can look at categories like dietetics
1:50:23
and diets I can also look at the references section so I can also see
1:50:28
what what information was provided like health effects of overweight and obesity I can look at diet and physical activity
1:50:35
so all of these are related to my main keyword healthy diet so the answers are
1:50:41
right in here on the platform they're just all over the page so Wikipedia has an abundance of information you just
1:50:47
need to know where to look so again with Wikipedia you can look no further in the first paragraph you look no further than
1:50:53
the C also section the references section category section there's lots of information right on the page itself to
1:51:00
help you get ideas for keywords so if you Google your keyword with Wikipedia
1:51:05
term in the search query and get relevant keywords from the title tags on the serp so you can also do that as well
1:51:11
so if I type in healthy diet Wikipedia and search I can also get some information here as well so people also
1:51:18
search for healthy food advantages or healthy food habits essay or information
1:51:24
about healthy food all of these are related to my keyword healthy diet so
1:51:29
again another bit of information for you to choose or look to choose some
1:51:35
additional keywords for so Reddit it's a popular Community where people post content and discuss a variety of topics
1:51:42
so that's what Reddit is so with the help of subreddits an individual can
1:51:48
find relevant keywords with with high search volume so in Reddit there's an easy way to find out keywords they have
1:51:54
a keyword tool called keyword it so the keyword it gives the average monthly searches for a particular keyword so if
1:52:01
we type a Word in key Reddit and choose keywords from the auto generated list this tool will extract the keywords and
1:52:08
give us those relevant terms with search volume so if we go to the keyword it and Show an example of that for example
1:52:14
healthy food if I get keywords I can see what keywords are relevant in the search
1:52:21
volume of that keyword so if I just type in healthy food keyword it tool is going to tell me some relevant keywords in
1:52:28
which the volume is so if you don't have the Keyword Planner tool in Google ads available to you this is a good
1:52:35
alternative solution to finding keywords so it's free you just need to go to
1:52:40
keyword.com type in your keyword click get keywords and what it's going to do
1:52:45
is give you some relevant keywords related to your primary keyword with the
1:52:50
search volume let's talk about keyword clustering now so the whole idea about
1:52:55
keyword clustering is to really take advantage of the keywords that we're
1:53:01
optimizing for to gain higher rankings so if we can cluster keywords together in a theme and that theme of keywords is
1:53:08
relevant to a specific page of a website then we have a better opportunity to rank so in other words why do we have to
1:53:15
Target just one keyword when we can Target many so keep in mind you know LSI
1:53:21
keywords we want to group a bunch of keywords together that are similar for Content so for example after some
1:53:27
keyword research search you can thematically group keywords into a core topic so for example we can cluster
1:53:34
these group of keywords together like for example what is SEO how does SEO work intro to SEO what are the basics of
1:53:41
SEO all of those are related to The Core theme what is SEO another cluster of
1:53:47
keywords for example could be SEO techniques SEO best practices tips and tricks website optimization on-page SEO
1:53:55
techniques Etc so those are clusters of keywords okay that we can group together in themes and if we group keywords
1:54:03
together in themes we can apply that to a particular content on our website so
1:54:09
the whole idea behind clustering keywords it's going to provide more diversity more of an opportunity for us
1:54:15
to be found so that's the whole idea behind clustering so some additional
1:54:21
steps remember stay up to date on industry news to brainstorm your ideas
1:54:26
first and identify by a list of keywords like ethema keywords that you can
1:54:31
cluster together and then you could determine the keywords that your competitors are already ranking for so
1:54:37
for example if we want to rank for the keyword SEO best practices for example
1:54:43
we can use a tool called keyword Moz if I go to keyword the keyword Explorer
1:54:49
tool and Moz and just type in SEO best practices what it's going to do is it's
1:54:54
going to give me some volume related to that particular keyword but more importantly what it's also going to do
1:55:00
is going to show me what pages are already ranked for that particular keyword so therefore I can get a sense
1:55:07
of who is already ranking for that keyword so here I can see Moz Moz medium.com alexa.com so I can get a
1:55:15
sense of what web pages are ranked for a particular keyword or group of keywords
1:55:21
I want to write for myself so if we look at tools for keyword research look no
1:55:26
further than Moz that's the mods of the tool I would just use but you could also use Google's Keyword Planner which we
1:55:32
used in the example so for example if I go back to the Google ads Keyword Planner if you're in Google ads you
1:55:39
click on tools you click on Cleveland planner and what Keyword Planner does is it provides you for a particular keyword
1:55:46
the average monthly search volume of the past 12 months it provides you information on seasonality so if I hover
1:55:53
my mouse over a graph I'm going to be able to see the volume per month over the last 12 months what the keyboard
1:56:00
planner also does is it provides me some additional ideas for my particular
1:56:06
keyword and in addition to that it's going to provide me some sense of how competitive that keyword is by telling
1:56:12
me whether it's low medium or high in terms of competition so there's sem Raj there's also other additional keywords
1:56:19
tools out there like word stream or href or the Reddit tool keyword it and then
1:56:25
Moz is is another tool I particularly you so if I go to Moz again here I can
1:56:31
just type in a keyword that I'm interested in it's going to give me the search volume of that keyword it's going
1:56:37
to give me the level of difficulty so 50 out of 100 so it's halfway between
1:56:44
difficulty and easy and then it's going to give me some additional metrics like for example what my expected organic
1:56:51
click-through rate would be if I were to rank for this keyword but more importantly what I like about this is we
1:56:57
could see exactly what other sites are linked to this particular keyword we're
1:57:02
interested in so here I can look at the top 10 list so this is mozz's keyword Explorer tool so that's what this tool
1:57:09
is and it's part of moz.com so there's a lot of tools at your disposal I
Tools For Keyword Research
1:57:15
particularly use Moz I particularly use Google's Keyword Planner and those are the tools I use but there are lots of
1:57:20
tools out there so if we order review everything we talked about with keyword research we started with why keyword
1:57:27
research so we want to always take a look at what keywords have a good ratio
1:57:33
of volume and competition so we always want high volume and low competition we
1:57:39
always want relevancy for our keyword and we always want to choose a primary keyword and secondary keywords so that's
1:57:45
things to look for when we talk about you know doing keyword research we want
1:57:50
to look for high volume low competition relevancy and also commercial intent are
1:57:56
we selling a product and do we want to use keywords like the word by in our keyword phrase that's going to get
1:58:02
somebody to purchase that product if they type in a similar keyword with Buy in it as an example so that's why and
1:58:09
how to do keyword research we talked about the types of different keywords that we can focus in on we specifically
1:58:16
talked about short tail keywords and long tail keywords so short tail keywords are going to be three words or
1:58:23
less in the keyword phrase they're always going to have high volume but most likely they're going to also have
1:58:29
high competition so it might take you longer to rank for that short tail
1:58:34
keyword because there's a lot of other websites who also want to rank for that keyword so my recommendation again is
1:58:41
stay away from short tail keywords because it's going to take you longer to rank now you can focus on longer tail
1:58:46
keywords now these keywords are more specific they're more than three words in the keyword phrase they're likely
1:58:53
going to have lower search volume but it's going to be more specific and it's probably going to bring more quality
1:58:59
traffic to your site so an example of a long tail keyword would be homemade
1:59:04
pizza dough recipes that's what we looked at earlier so you can always pick keywords that are longer tail but also
1:59:11
relevant to your content and again the benefits quality traffic and probably higher engagement then we looked at
1:59:18
alternative suggestions to doing keyword research we talked about LSI keywords so
1:59:23
LSI keywords or latent semantic indexing so we want to take a look at keyword words that are relevant or related to
1:59:30
your primary keyword we looked at other platforms where you can go and find other relevant keywords we talked about
1:59:38
quora we talked about Google suggestions in terms of their search engine and their toolbar talked about Wikipedia
1:59:44
going to Wikipedia and using the categories or references section we talked about Reddit with the keyword
1:59:50
tool that allows you to see you know keywords in the search volume there and again that's a free tool to use so you
1:59:57
have lots of suggestions lots of tools at your disposal like Moz sem rush so
2:00:03
there's no shortage of places you can go to to find keywords the key takeaways
2:00:09
really is find keywords that are relevant stick with longer tail you know find supporting LSI related keywords
2:00:16
choose your keywords wisely in terms of commercial intent and then stay away from keywords that are highly
2:00:22
competitive because the more competition for keyword the longer it is going to take you to be found for that keyword
2:00:28
work we then finished up with keyword clustering so group your keywords together in a theme so remember if we
2:00:34
cluster keywords together in a Content theme then likely it's going to be more relevant for the content it's going to
2:00:41
give us a better opportunity found for a variety of keywords definitely use the tools to your advantage some are free
2:00:47
some are not my suggestion on using different tools is to try them out see
2:00:53
how the user interface works for you see what kind of data that these different tools provide are they easy to use and
2:00:59
does it provide all the different information you're looking for like competition or who else is ranking for a
2:01:06
particular keyword or the volume and some of the other metrics that you may need to do your keyword research so try
2:01:12
your own tools out and see what you like you don't necessarily have to go with our suggestions but certainly the likes
2:01:19
of Moz or sem rush or Google's Keyword Planner are always popular amongst people who do SEO in the section on on
Off Page SEO
2:01:26
page optimization we talked about fact factors that centered on relevancy in this section we're going to go in a
2:01:32
different direction we're going to talk about the signals that focus on popularity so what does popularity mean
2:01:37
in this context well it's actually quite simple popularity always relates to links to hyperlinks on the web so you
2:01:43
have seen these when you see the typically blue text that is underlined what this is is a tool it's a ahref
2:01:50
technically in HTML that is pointing from one web document to a different one this is a pretty simple concept I
2:01:56
imagine you already know this so what does this mean from an SEO perspective well it turns out that this
2:02:01
gigantic group of signals the ones related to hyperlinks are and are and historically have been the Lion's Share
2:02:08
of signals that the search engines process when trying to rank pages now there's one big problem with these
2:02:13
from an SEO perspective is that they are historically and today very difficult to
2:02:21
influence this is because they do not take place on your website they take place elsewhere it's other people who are linking to you generally speaking
2:02:27
and this makes them very very difficult to have an influence on so this is a good thing and a bad thing it's a good
2:02:32
thing because it it turns out to be a great metric for ranking web documents it's a bad thing because it's hard for
2:02:37
us to make an impact on day-to-day level hands down the most time consuming and difficult part of SEO is link building
2:02:43
now there's a lot of reasons for this primarily because it's constantly changing and because of all the elements
2:02:49
that are involved with this but the big the bigger takeaway here is that there's no one-size-fits-all solution for link
2:02:55
building you have to take the context of your business of your website and you have to apply general principles to that
2:03:00
so in this video we're going to cover these general principles so you can figure out how to apply those to your business
2:03:05
these principles are and I think these are the most clever and the most important ones are creating link worthy content
2:03:11
proactively participate in an off-site engagement and utilizing offline relationships the tried and true method
2:03:18
for building links is creating content that's optimized for humans so let me explain what this means the currency of
2:03:25
the internet if you will is the content itself that's why people go on they want to read the newest article or they want to see the newest video whatever it may
2:03:32
be that is what has been true since the beginning and I have no doubt will be true going forward so as an SEO or as an
2:03:37
online marketer in general you can use this to your advantage creating the content that people are going to want to share with their friends whether they're
2:03:43
going to want to cite in any kind of paper or whatever they're working on that is a tried and true way of getting links this is what we call the power of
2:03:50
content you can do all kinds of bells and whistles you can go do these newest tactics you can try all these different things out but at the end of the day
2:03:56
what's really important is the content itself so this is what I focus on this is where 80 of my time goes on when I'm
2:04:02
working on link building it's on the content itself can I create something that is just truly that is so truly
2:04:07
great that someone essentially has to link to it this is what I focus on trying to answer and while there is no
2:04:13
simple answer to that go and ask that question always sets you in the right direction the next strategy that I want to talk
2:04:19
about is actually very counter-intuitive so if you're trying to build links to your own website I found one of the most
2:04:24
effective ways and this is consistently true is to engage off your own site now
2:04:29
this doesn't make any sense right why would you work on other people's websites if you're trying to promote your yourself well think about human
2:04:36
beings human beings are much more likely to link and give back to people to human beings that they know well so a lot of
2:04:42
the time I spend when I'm doing link building is spent off-site engaging with others so sometimes this is through
2:04:48
social media so I'll use whatever the latest social network is and I'll chat with people there who have similar interests or have similar interests to
2:04:54
what I'm trying to promote be it a different topic or be it a new industry altogether I'll spend a lot of time
2:05:00
promoting others and a lot of times chatting with other people building up genuine real relationships with human
2:05:05
beings so that when it comes time for them to write an article or when it's when they're ready to link out to other people I'm the first person they think
2:05:12
too and they link back to my website one of the reasons that link building is so hard is because the internet moves so fast asked what worked yesterday might
2:05:19
not work tomorrow so one of the most clever and easy ways to avoid this problem is to just simply
2:05:24
go offline utilize some of the relationships that you have off of the internet in order to benefit on the
2:05:29
internet this is something I try to do all the time because it consistently works by far the easiest favors to cash
2:05:34
in on are the ones that you're already owed so these might be from your friends who you work with it might be from friends who from childhood these are
2:05:40
people who you actually know in the real world who are much more likely to help you when you're trying to promote new
2:05:45
content online so what I'm trying to do link building one of the things I focus on is people that I know in the real world
2:05:51
so this can be lots of things this can be personal friends who happen to have websites and blogs this can be friendly
2:05:57
competition you have or friendly allies you have in your space just saying hey we're looking for these kind of things can you help us out and maybe I'll help
2:06:03
you out somewhere else it's utilizing these relationships that Exist Elsewhere so that you can start gaining these links yourself
2:06:09
if that doesn't work if maybe you don't have any friends in these Arenas you can always go to local businesses and local
2:06:14
agencies so sometimes this is a government-owned thing sometimes this is just third parties all together
2:06:19
there's lots of things that they need help with that you as a business owner or you as trying to promote some client may be able to help them with and if you
2:06:26
can help them offline they're more much more likely to help you online well link building it's very important to understand that not all links are are
2:06:33
created equally a link coming from the home page of CNN is going to provide a lot of what we call link Equity it's
2:06:38
gonna have a lot of popularity metrics tied to it and so it's going to be more valuable to you and help you rank higher
2:06:43
whereas a link also coming from the home page but let's say Joe's spam blog that
2:06:50
is not going to be particularly helpful for you and it actually in some cases could hurt you so when you're going out and doing link building make sure that
2:06:56
you can stand behind the source of the link that is coming at you this could be in a good example from like a government website where it's trusted and a bad
2:07:02
example this could be from a website that you would not normally go to even on your own in addition to that there's different
2:07:09
kinds of links depending on the direction that they're going so if a link is coming towards you towards your website that's called an inbound link
2:07:15
these are the ones that are very helpful for popularity metrics that we've talked about there's also outbound links these are
2:07:21
links that you linking to other people now generally there's a big misconception about this that you'd
2:07:27
think you would not want to link out to other people but if you just follow the natural Channel events and you look at people who are writing blogs without SEO
2:07:34
in mind you'll see that they are linking out naturally and it's these natural patterns that search engines are looking for so there's absolutely no problem in
2:07:40
linking out just as long as it's two sources that you actually do trust so there's inbound links there's outbound
2:07:47
links there's links that have a lot of popularity value so like from an established Government website or from something popular like CNN there's also
2:07:54
links that are inbound that are not going to have as much value for you that you probably don't want to spend your time building now regardless of where
2:08:00
your links are coming from it's important to look out for one particular attribute it's called Rel nofollow Rel
2:08:05
no follow was a tool that was originally developed to combat comment spam like on blogs you'd have lots of people who are
2:08:11
leaving completely irrelevant comments so they can link back to their own website and get credit for that that does not work
2:08:17
at all today one of the primary reasons for that is the search engine introduced something called Rel nofollow where they
2:08:23
said here's a link that's going out for my website but I do not stand behind it and it does not pass any credit a lot of
2:08:28
times when you're doing leak building you'll get a link which you're very proud of coming from somewhere very popular but then realize that it has
2:08:34
this attribute attached to it no follow and which means you will not get any credit for it so make sure that when
2:08:39
you're doing your leak building the link coming at you that you've earned does not have this attribute associated with
2:08:45
it otherwise you will get no credit for it now that you understand what nofollow is let's let's talk about the biggest
2:08:50
use case for this social media most of the links that we see in social media are valueless this is because they're
2:08:58
either hidden from search engines entirely this mostly happens on Facebook or they're visible to search engines but
2:09:05
they use this row this Rel nofollow attribute which means that they're useless so while social media does have many many benefits SEO and particularly
2:09:12
link value from SEO is not one of the direct benefits of participating in social media now that we've covered some
2:09:18
of the link building dues let's talk about some of the link building don'ts so these are things that you should not do because you'll be wasting your time
Link Building Don'ts
2:09:25
and possibly more importantly your money the first one is Spam so we have all seen this online when you go somewhere
2:09:31
and you see just a bunch of spammy links links that are clearly written only for machines only for search engines a lot
2:09:38
of times these will have the name of pharmaceutical drugs on them a lot of times they'll have um just can be completely irrelevant to the content
2:09:45
while these have worked in some instances they are certainly not a best practice and they are certainly not a
2:09:51
long-term strategy so I never recommend trying to invest in spammy links this way because it's not going to ultimately
2:09:57
help you in fact in many ways it'll probably hurt you so do not go out of your way to try to get spammy links
2:10:02
the next one is buying links this is these are toes closely tied together now buying links is when you go out and try
2:10:08
to buy sometimes relevant sometimes irrelevant links and again this is something that had it worked sometimes
2:10:14
historically not always my biggest problem with this is not so much the ethical problem although there is one
2:10:19
there the search engines have clearly said not to ever do this my biggest problem with it is that you could not
2:10:25
calculate an accurate Roi on this so if you spend a dollar on this you don't know if you're gonna make a dollar or two dollars back you have no idea
2:10:31
there's no way to accurately measure this so you have no idea if this if this is valuable to you or not
2:10:36
where as opposed to if you're creating valuable content you can measure that and you can directly tie it to Sales so
2:10:43
your your money dollar for dollar is spent much much more effectively on content than it is on buying links so I
2:10:49
highly recommend do not spend your time or your money buying links the last one is acquiring reciprocal
2:10:54
links so reciprocal links as you can imagine are links that go in a circle you link to somebody and they link directly back to you now in the natural
2:11:01
web when no marketing is taking new place into this there's no kind of manipulation trying to go on that happens that happens all the time so
2:11:08
don't go out of your way and be afraid of this happening so one new site will very regularly link to another news article and that article might link back
2:11:14
to them somewhere else that happens so don't stress about this too much but don't go out of your way to try to build
2:11:19
all of your links in a reciprocal way we're overthinking this by trying to link to somebody else who links to a third party that third party links to
2:11:25
you don't waste your time this is just not a factor that you should worry about reciprocal links are not generally as
2:11:30
good as one-way links but it happens so often that is not is not worthy of your time or any kind of investment trying to
2:11:36
avoid this the concept of linking is foundational to good rankings and understanding the
2:11:44
internet at Large it starts with the premise that good content will be cited by others
2:11:51
recommending it to other people how we cite and recommend information online is by linking to it
2:11:58
we link to information that we find valuable based on that the search engines assess
2:12:06
content by how websites link to one another so we are going to cover the definition
How to Build Backlinks?
2:12:12
and purpose of links and the different functions that links serve
2:12:18
we'll also look at how links mirror human judgment we'll look at how search engines
2:12:24
evaluate links by mirroring human judgment and how that affects what's called Block
2:12:30
Level analysis and how where the location of different links and how they are used will greatly
2:12:37
affect their relevance we're going to look at how visitors from different link sources will behave
2:12:43
differently based on where they came from and also how you can measure the
2:12:49
effectiveness of links and finally we're going to look at both good and bad linking practices now links serve a
2:12:58
number of purposes from a functional standpoint they usually are our primary means of
2:13:04
navigation online we click on links we go to different pages and from those
2:13:09
pages we find links to other pages links are also a method of citing other
2:13:15
content when we quote somebody when we use information that we have found somewhere
2:13:21
else we cite that information to give credit to the original author typically
2:13:26
online we do that with a link so that if someone wants to see the original Source
2:13:32
document it's available to them that also helps to provide credibility to you
2:13:38
credibility to the author of the original source as well as assigning importance to the knowledge that came
2:13:46
from that original source and the authority of the original source links also provide us with a clear
2:13:53
structure of how our websites are built how the pages relate to one another and
2:13:59
how organized the information can be so let's break down the functional part
2:14:05
of a link this is important if you're going to be developing anchor text and linking to
2:14:11
understand the structure the ahref equals is the start of the
2:14:17
link tag what you are doing is developing the reference of where the document is
2:14:25
contained that's the href reference is what it is short for
2:14:31
what comes next within the quotes is the location of the document now this can be
2:14:37
a full URL or you may just be linking to a document that's on the main root level
2:14:44
of your server this is the full location where you can access the document
2:14:50
and so you're putting the name of the document the extension so that it will be linked
2:14:56
the next part is what I have in caps you'll notice off to the left I have
2:15:03
something in all blue text and underlined which most people will recognize as a link
2:15:08
you see when it is in between the document location
2:15:13
and the closing of the link tag the text you have in there is what's called anchor text
2:15:19
you see instead of publishing the document location and the full URL of
2:15:25
the document we can put the link within text and
2:15:30
create anchor text so all someone has to do is click on the link and the document loads for them
2:15:36
this anchor text is vitally important to understanding how we can add additional
2:15:42
relevance to linking content then we see the closure of the link tag
2:15:49
this is what makes the internet the internet is millions of pages connected
2:15:55
together by Links so when we look at the functional side
2:16:02
of links and we look at this example here as you can see the title of this article is not the URL address of the
2:16:11
article it's a title and the title is the link that is the anchor text of the link
2:16:18
and so from a search engine standpoint search engines look to see what words
2:16:23
are being used in the link and how relevant those words are to the document
2:16:29
that is being linked it also looks to see where is the link
2:16:34
is it in the editorial information in the article is it part of the navigation
2:16:41
is it in a sidebar or is it an ad and then also search engines are looking
2:16:47
to see if this is a text link or an image link how long has that link been there
2:16:54
what type of link is it does it go somewhere within your website does it go
2:17:00
to another website or is it a reciprocal link which I will explain more later
2:17:06
they also look to see the text in the link and the context to the page with
2:17:11
the link directs you to we utilize links a little differently
2:17:17
you see from a human standpoint whenever we refer information to another person
2:17:23
when we provide reference material to another person or even if someone asks us for a recommendation we provide this
2:17:31
information you see offline we mirror the same behavior as we do online when we link
2:17:39
people ask us for information and we provide it we just mirror that online by making a
2:17:46
link offline we recommend we refer we provide
2:17:52
information to each other in much the same way the way I want you to think about it from a human standpoint is that
2:17:59
if you asked another person for advice or directions or a referral
2:18:04
are there certain people that you would trust more than others I'm sure the answer to that is yes and
2:18:11
maybe you have some people in mind that you are thinking about you see we run across the same issue
2:18:18
with search the search engines know that there are some websites that are much more
2:18:23
trustworthy than others just like if you were to ask someone for
2:18:28
information I'm sure you would ask the right person for the information you would ask the
2:18:34
most knowledgeable trustworthy person you knew who had Authority in that subject area
2:18:42
the search engines are trying to do the same thing with the links that we publish on our websites they're trying
2:18:49
to determine who is the most trustworthy and relevant based on the
2:18:54
recommendations referrals and citations of other websites to other websites
2:19:01
who are the websites that are trusted that are authorities the search engines are trying to do from
2:19:07
a technical algorithmic standpoint what we do naturally from a human standpoint
2:19:15
now from The Human Side as I had said before we need to think of links as information that we receive from other
2:19:21
people Word of Mouth advice information directions recommendations this is where
2:19:28
we need to think about links not from the standpoint of building false relevance for a search engine but being
2:19:35
a helpful resource for our readers how can we help them how can we provide
2:19:41
information and how can we be a credible source of information
2:19:47
how can we develop our Authority within the industry and so that people who have
2:19:55
questions about this content will see our websites as authoritative and
2:20:01
credible resources the best way to develop links as you'll see is good content when people like
2:20:09
what they read when they like what they see when they are willing to recommend it to others it's because you have
2:20:17
created something of value and they'll link to you when they feel
2:20:22
that you are credible and that you are authoritative with this
2:20:28
information only then will they share it with other people because you have earned that right for
2:20:35
them to share it with others by providing content that is informative educational
2:20:41
entertaining and you've provided that service only then will people then want
2:20:47
to recommend it to others by linking to it now links serve a number of benefits
2:20:55
When I look at some of the incoming links to my site one of the things I notice is that if I get a link in
2:21:01
certain places that can drive a lot of brand exposure I can have thousands of
2:21:07
people coming to the site looking to see an article and that provides a lot of
2:21:13
exposure to a lot of people however also getting a link from a
2:21:18
certain website especially if it's a high relevant authoritative website I
2:21:25
can see my rankings increase because of that but then also a good link is going to
2:21:31
drive people that will convert and drive sales or leads those who become
2:21:37
customers so those are the three aspects of a good link a good link will drive traffic to
2:21:44
your site a good link will assist your rankings and a good link will bring in business
2:21:51
if you can get a link to do all three of those at the same time that's what I call the golden link because it has all
2:21:58
three benefits usually however you're going to find that different links will provide
2:22:03
different types of benefits one of these three or maybe two out of these three
2:22:09
one of the things I'm usually very focused on is the link that drives sales
2:22:14
or generates leads that's getting links in the right place that will benefit me
2:22:20
tangibly rather than just getting thousands of people to see it
2:22:25
why it benefits me financially if I can get a link in the right place
2:22:32
so from here let's break down the different types of links we have navigational links we see these in our
2:22:40
navigation our primary navigation maybe the footer of our web pages where we
2:22:45
have links to typical information such as about us or contact us
2:22:50
we also have sidebar links this might be related information or offers or calls
2:22:57
to action and then also I would break it down into outbound or inbound type of navigation
2:23:04
outbound are links going to other websites inbound links are links that
2:23:09
come from other websites and that also I might send to other pages on my own site
2:23:15
now I've used the term editorial an editorial link is a link that is found
2:23:21
within the content of the website and by that I mean through an article
2:23:27
so if I am writing an article and I link to someone else and cite them or
2:23:33
reference them that is what's called an editorial link
2:23:38
it means that it's part of the content a great example of this is that the
2:23:43
navigation on your web pages is not part of the content it serves a function as navigation
2:23:51
but it doesn't have anything to do with supporting information with citing and
2:23:56
Authority so information and links that you put within the content and presented content
2:24:02
of your site are considered editorial now there's also a call to action links
2:24:07
where you're bringing someone to a landing page or a registration page or a sale page
2:24:14
then also we have Social Links now these can provide a variety of means but
2:24:20
typically a social link will go to a profile maybe it's a username that takes you
2:24:27
somewhere else or comment or maybe just an image or something that goes to a
2:24:33
social site or that you have placed on your own site as well either way it's all contained within
2:24:41
that social network even though the links are going on and off your site they tend to be controlled in that
2:24:47
social environment now I've used the term reciprocal link now this is
2:24:55
something very specific a reciprocal link is one where you would
2:25:00
go to somebody else and you would make a trade such as if you link to me I'll
2:25:06
link to you and maybe you put those links on the home page or maybe you create a page just for that link
2:25:13
you see sometimes it just doesn't make sense and so the search engines will see
2:25:18
that you've linked to each other but if there's no contextual relevance if
2:25:24
there's no contextual relevance most likely you won't get any benefit because you've agreed to link to each
2:25:31
other for the primary purpose of boosting rankings now this is not to say that two websites can't link to each
2:25:38
other because there is some relevance we'll look at some examples of that
2:25:44
later on in this module also then we have advertising links these can be ads banners anything on the
2:25:52
page that is an advertising link that if you were to click on it you would go to that advertisers page
2:25:59
those links are typically through an ad server and they take place in entirely
2:26:04
different ecosystem but they are links and we need to know
2:26:10
what kind of links are advertising and which kind of links are functional to
2:26:15
our websites now when I broke down the different types of links so we have our navigation
2:26:20
links we have links in our sidebar and in our footer with Block Level analysis
2:26:25
does is that the search engines look at the code of the page they break down the page because it's
2:26:32
very easy to figure out which part of the code has to do with your navigation which part of the code has to do with
2:26:38
your sidebar and your footer and which part of the code is calling ads from an ad server what this leaves is the
2:26:45
editorial content your article and the ability of search engines then to break
2:26:50
down your page into these different elements the reason why they do it is that the links contained in the
2:26:57
editorial space are considered to be more relevant in terms of linking to
2:27:03
other websites than any of the other types of links on your web page search
2:27:08
engines don't consider all parts of the page to be equally relevant which is okay because neither do humans we look
2:27:15
at the navigation as utilization pure utility because it's just helping me
2:27:21
navigate among the different pages of your website I'm not expecting to learn anything I'm using it as a functional
2:27:28
means of navigating your site now your sidebar might have some calls to action it might have links to other pages but
2:27:35
it's not an article it's what you've developed and so it might be a little more important than your navigation but
2:27:41
it's not as important as what you may have written within content your footer navigation is basically the same you
2:27:48
control that it's the same on every page and so what the search engines are looking for are the unique content the
2:27:56
unique article or information that you've published and if there is a link within the editorial content that is
2:28:03
highly relevant because it has to do with content it has to do with information that you are sharing and so
2:28:09
the links there are going to be more highly relevant and are going to be more important for the search engines to see
2:28:16
you see it's the same way with humans we're not going to look at navigation to
2:28:21
learn something it's functional the same thing with the footer and as humans we're reading the content that you have
2:28:28
in your article and if you link to another source well you've provided us with utility but it's contextual utility
2:28:36
because you're citing where you found information or you're citing an
2:28:41
additional Source or you are linking to an example and it enables me as a human
2:28:47
to see that understand it and if I need that additional information I can click
2:28:52
on it and go to it so I'm going to look at the information on the page in that article very
2:28:59
differently that I'm going to look at the headings the navigation the sidebars
2:29:05
or the footer because the article is what is informing me and so the links in
2:29:10
the article I'm going to look at very differently and hold them in a higher level of relevance
2:29:18
now over time search engines have had to refine the algorithm about links
2:29:24
you see in the early days of search engine algorithms they used to Simply count the amount of links than if one
2:29:31
site had more links than another that made it more credible however once people started to figure
2:29:37
that out people started accumulating links by really any means necessary
2:29:42
and they were just looking for the sheer volume of links because they knew if
2:29:47
they got the most amount of links it would affect their rankings and so over the years the search engines
2:29:53
have had to change and adjust and add more relevance to their algorithm
2:29:59
refine it in order to look at different aspects of links in order to properly determine relevance
2:30:06
so over time it wasn't just having a link it was then also looking at how
2:30:12
many people cite this site as an authority so looking at the source of
2:30:17
the link and the types of pages then also looking at the text of the link and matching it with the text of
2:30:23
the page does it match is it contextual and then looking at the type of Link
2:30:29
doing the Block Level analysis and then also the context the relevancy
2:30:35
of your site compared to the linking site compared to the link and the
2:30:40
information that's being shared there also some of the ways that they can look at it are the age of the link how long
2:30:46
has that link been there humans do the same thing when we look to see how long someone has been in
2:30:52
business we're looking at credibility and then of course there are many many other ongoing refinements that are going
2:31:00
into the search engines evaluations of links sometimes the age of the link isn't as relevant especially when you're
2:31:06
looking for something that has happened very recently an Old Link could mean that it's old
2:31:13
news or that something has changed since then so search engines are in a constant
2:31:18
battle to ensure that people are not gaming the system
2:31:24
by falsely creating relevance through linking the link relevancy and the algorithm is
2:31:32
all about trying to determine who is the most relevant and credible within this
2:31:38
area and that is the focus of most search engine algorithm refinements over the
2:31:44
past few years and it will be into the future now this is where I'm going to start bringing in some screenshots from a link
2:31:51
Management program as a search engine Optimizer a link Management program is probably going to
2:31:58
be one of your best friends as you move along in this industry in this example this program link Decks
2:32:05
that I'm using will track the incoming links to my website and it'll also
2:32:10
provide a breakdown as to what type of website those links are coming from so I
2:32:17
can see how many links I have from blogs how many links I have from news sites how many links from wikis how many links
2:32:25
from directories forums social media public relations sites articles or
2:32:31
additional resources then I can also add my competitors and I
2:32:37
can compare where I stand in terms of the amount of links from each source and
2:32:42
where my competitors stand in this way I can be sure that we all have a similar link profile you see if
2:32:50
my linking profile looks vastly different than all my competitors the search engines are going to see that as
2:32:55
well and know that something might be different with me good or bad and that's
2:33:01
going to raise a red flag so I want to look at the linking profile because every industry and
2:33:07
almost every business is linking profile is going to be a little different but especially among Industries we see that
2:33:14
linking profiles that is the amount of links from different sources it's going to be slightly different for every
2:33:21
different type of industry or business so this helps me understand where my
2:33:26
links are coming from which is vitally important because from a business standpoint one thing that I've tracked
2:33:33
consistently in analytics is that people will act differently and also I can
2:33:39
predict which source is going to send me the best customers
2:33:45
you see just because someone comes from a link doesn't mean they're going to buy or become a customer or really become a
2:33:52
lead many times they're going to come look at your information and leave
2:33:58
and based on how they come to your site whether it's through a Blog a directory
2:34:03
a forum or a new site has a lot to do with how they view your website
2:34:09
and it's all about the context you see this is what I've learned over the years is that people will behave
2:34:14
differently based on how they find the website what I found is that people from blogs
2:34:21
news sites and articles they tend to stay longer do more and have a higher
2:34:28
chance of conversion of becoming a customer or a lead
2:34:34
the main reason is because blogs and articles they have a lot of context it's
2:34:40
an article someone has taken the time to write some information out and then link to my site which means there is a highly
2:34:47
contextual reason for someone to click that link also what it means is that there's a lot
2:34:54
less competition for that link when my link is in that article
2:35:00
compare that with social news or any type of social site you see when you're on a social site and
2:35:07
you're looking at your social stream of information there's a lot of different people competing for your attention a
2:35:14
lot of different things and it's not just in one subject area it's usually from multiple subject areas and so the
2:35:22
context is very low because there's a lot of different types of information and the competition for your attention
2:35:28
is very high because of that people from social sites or applications
2:35:34
tend to visit more often but they only tend to view one page and leave
2:35:39
immediately because they're looking to see what was interesting and then they move on to the
2:35:45
next subject that's the difference between how people react based on where they come from
2:35:52
and so when I'm measuring links I'm looking to see which links do I have
2:35:58
what's the source and then how do those sources behave differently from one
2:36:04
another and why you see if I find that I'm getting links from sources that people are staying
2:36:11
longer doing more and converting at a higher rate then I'm going to continue to focus on building links in those
2:36:18
areas because it directly affects how I monetize my website
2:36:25
so here's a strategy in building links one of the things I'm looking at is the
2:36:32
source of links like I said if I can find a link Source that's providing
2:36:37
visitors that will stay look at my content engage with the content and eventually convert and convert at a
2:36:44
higher rate than other sources of content or visitors then I'm going to focus on that source
2:36:52
and so I'm going to look at some high Authority websites whether they're industry Publications news sites
2:36:58
education sites those are what are considered high Authority blogs articles news sites
2:37:06
that's what I'm looking to do I want to find the most authoritative website and sometimes it happens naturally if
2:37:15
people that work at those websites or manage those sites if they find you and they like your content they'll link to
2:37:21
it and that way you can get more credibility more relevancy
2:37:27
certain people certain organizations certain websites have more Authority influence than others it goes back to
2:37:34
the question that I asked you early in this module that how do you know if someone is more authoritative than
2:37:41
somebody else we also have mid Authority websites which you can get some links on and low
2:37:48
Authority websites which are very easy to get links but here's what I've learned when it comes to link building
2:37:55
one link from one high quality website can be worth hundreds or thousands of
2:38:02
mid to low quality links ultimately it's about quality not
2:38:08
quantity one of the things that I will do utilizing my link software is look at
2:38:16
the context of the link I want to see how relevant this is so as I said if I want to find a high relevant
2:38:23
website what I'm looking for in terms of this is I want to see the influence of
2:38:30
the domain as well as the relevance of the domain those are two factors that
2:38:36
we're going to look at when we're evaluating the quality of a domain now
2:38:41
as I'm looking at this report here what influence means is that it is a high
2:38:47
quality website that within the linking algorithm these sites have a lot of
2:38:54
authority however they may not be relevant
2:38:59
so for example they may have a lot of sites attributing authority to them
2:39:06
but they may not be relevant to my industry which is why we have the next column of keyword relevance
2:39:13
you see when I'm evaluating my links I'm looking for the sources that are both
2:39:19
influential and relevant that means that I've got a link from a
2:39:25
site that fits the two standards of high Authority it's authoritative and
2:39:32
relevant now it's good to have links from authoritative sites that might not be relevant
2:39:37
it's still authoritative however to get the full benefit I want
2:39:43
it to be influential and relevant but not to say that I'm not looking for
2:39:49
links from these other sources this is just a means of measuring what you have as well as comparing it to your
2:39:56
competitors and other websites now here's some best practices when I'm
2:40:04
optimizing anchor text I want to maintain contextual relevance so I want
2:40:10
to use text in the text link and I want to explain to people what they're
2:40:15
linking to what they're going to find when they click on that link if I use an
2:40:21
image as a link I'm going to use an ALT attribute because if that image doesn't show up that ultrabute
2:40:28
is necessary to let people know where to go but also I do get a little tiny bit of
2:40:35
benefit by using that alt attribute within the image link I also want to look at the relevance of
2:40:42
the source page that I'm linking to and make sure contextually the link the link text and the content of the page is
2:40:49
contextually relevant to the destination page I also want to be sure that I don't
2:40:54
overuse the keywords that I don't make multiple links to the same destination
2:41:01
that I don't use the same anchor text over and over I can be downgraded or even penalized by
2:41:08
the search engine algorithm if that is found on my pages so as an example instead of using click
2:41:16
here for a how-to article I might use the exact phrase of how to
2:41:22
fix whatever it is and use that as the link to the page that has the content
2:41:29
that's a simple way of looking at anchor text am I directing someone to
2:41:34
additional information if I am then how can I present it to them so they know
2:41:40
exactly what they're going to find and Link it appropriately
2:41:46
I look at it as developing the next step for your readers where do you want them
2:41:51
to go what do you want them to do what resources do you have available to them how can you structure them so that
2:41:59
they're easily understood and you're explaining the Final Destination
2:42:06
like I said if you overuse anchor text you can be downgraded or penalized by
2:42:13
the search engines so what I will tell you to do is number one avoid overstuffing anchor content
2:42:20
that means needlessly repeating keywords in the anchor text don't do that
2:42:26
avoid being redundant meaning don't have four or five or six links with the same
2:42:33
anchor text going to the same page that's a clear way of letting search engines know that you're going overboard
2:42:41
don't just randomly Place links throughout your text just to get the link
2:42:47
ask yourself are you really helping the reader find the information they need
2:42:52
and do it once and then also avoid extremely overly
2:42:58
promotional words within the linked text such as best expert cheap number one
2:43:05
those types of things so a couple examples we can say for travel advice click here but I would say
2:43:13
here is my travel advice and Link travel advice rewrite it be creative
2:43:22
if it were easy everyone would be doing it but this is where you can write things
2:43:29
in a better way to get the attention of the reader and position it as a resource
2:43:34
also utilizing your url as the link or as the anchor text as well for the link
2:43:41
in order to get that click as I've got it here I would not
2:43:47
recommend that you use that I would recommend that you avoid that also the third line the check out the
2:43:54
best website for iPhones and iPhone accessories utilizing overly promotional words is one of those ways that you can
2:44:01
easily get caught by the search engines now for future considerations when it
2:44:08
comes to Links realize that the majority of algorithm changes are link based
2:44:13
evaluation refinements because people are constantly attempting to fool the search engines and develop a false link
2:44:21
profile you should work to create high quality
2:44:26
links with high quality content I wouldn't chase after Poor or low
2:44:32
quality links
2:44:38
now as I've mentioned before there are a number of tools available for you to
2:44:43
manage and measure your backlinks tools such as link decks Moz Raven Advanced
2:44:49
Link manager Majestic SEO and then also you can use your Google analytics as
2:44:54
well however Google analytics only shows you the visitors that have come from
2:45:00
links and what they've done the basic functions of Link management software and there are many other types other
2:45:06
than what are listed here but the first thing that it does is just provide a catalog of incoming links from
2:45:15
other domains to your site and your competitor sites they offer tools for
2:45:21
comparison to see which domains are linking to you what type of link it is and on which Pages those links are
2:45:28
listed they'll also report newly acquired links in the past 30 60 90 days
2:45:33
or something similar to that the purpose of Link management software is to help you assess high quality domains versus
2:45:41
low quality domains in terms of importance and relevance
2:45:47
like I said the first job of a link management tool is to collect all of
2:45:52
your backlinks you add your domain and the tools will usually spider the domain
2:45:57
they'll go out into search engines and go out into many other formats in order to find and retrace who is linking to
2:46:05
you what page that link is contained sometimes what text is on that page and
2:46:11
what text is being used in the link they will catalog all of your incoming links organize them format them and report
2:46:19
back to you most of these link programs provide additional filters and management tools so that you can get
2:46:25
more insights about who is linking to you how they are linking to you and the
2:46:31
type of site personally I use Link decks in order to Monitor and report on my backlinking so
2:46:40
the first report here that I'm showing out of Link decks is that I see the total amount of incoming links to my
2:46:46
domain this says I have over 2 000 links and those 2 000 links are on about 1 000
2:46:54
domains on average it looks like I have about two links from every domain that
2:47:00
is linking to me so this is one way that you start to look at your links number
2:47:05
one the total amount of domains that are linking to you and then the total amount
2:47:10
of links available this way you can isolate domains that are linking to you consistently and also find those that
2:47:18
may not be the best domains or that are sending a lot of links that are just not
2:47:23
relevant the next thing I do in analyzing My Links is to look at the type of Link
2:47:30
meaning the type of site that it's coming from this report breaks down the amount of
2:47:37
links coming from blogs news sites directories forums social sites articles
2:47:43
or resources now it doesn't usually get all of those links but it does get
2:47:48
enough to give you an idea of how well you're doing in each channel one of the
2:47:54
things that I do like about this report is it also has a timeline so I can look and see when new links have been
2:48:00
acquired and maybe when some links have been just disappeared that's called
2:48:06
churn and it's normal it's normal because many times a link is published on social media and it kind of just goes
2:48:13
away or it's not tracked anymore by your link management software it can't find
2:48:19
it anymore and so linking is always Dynamic you are always gaining new links
2:48:25
and losing old links there's going to be a normal amount of churn
2:48:32
the next report shows me all of the domains that are linking to me it also shows me in the next column how many of
2:48:40
those domains are also linking to at least one competitor and it will list as many competitors as I have listed in
2:48:46
here if they list to multiple competitors it would let me know the influence of
2:48:52
that site or the authority that site is seen because of the amount of websites
2:48:58
and credibility that Authority has for that domain it'll also let me know the keyword relevance how relevant that
2:49:06
website is overall contextually to my domain and the content that I have
2:49:12
it will also let me know how many pages on that domain have links to my website
2:49:18
so I can also go through and I can filter this list by the type of site I
2:49:23
can filter by those domains that are using anchor text to see how much anchor
2:49:29
text is being used and what type of anchor text there are many different ways that you can filter through all of
2:49:35
the domains that are linking to you in order to get an idea of what's happening
2:49:41
on your domain what are competitors doing and also the relevance of those
2:49:47
links to your site now when I say that I can add competitors this is another type of
2:49:54
report very similar to the one I showed earlier where I look at my own standing in the different types of sources of
2:50:00
links such as blogs directories forums and so on I can also when I add my
2:50:06
competitors look to see how they are performing in those different areas as
2:50:11
well and so I can compare my link profile to my competitors
2:50:17
different Industries are going to have different backlink profiles they might be more heavily weighted towards blogs
2:50:23
or they might be more heavily weighted towards forums or social sites in this
2:50:28
way I can look to see if my competitors are actively link building and how
2:50:34
they're going about it I can see where maybe they are excelling in one area that the rest of the competitors are not
2:50:40
so I can compare different strategies I can also compare different timelines to
2:50:46
see if I am acquiring Links at a faster rate than my competitors this is very important if you are a newer business or
2:50:53
a newer website trying to compete now specifically what I can do is look
2:50:59
at an individual domain in this case this domain has three pages linking to
2:51:05
me and that domain also links to two of my competitors I can look at the
2:51:10
specific pages and what I'm looking at here are Snippets this should be familiar to you because what it's
2:51:16
showing is the URL of the page that's linking to my page it shows me the page
2:51:22
title of that page and then in this report it lets me know if there are any
2:51:28
keywords being used in the link in the anchor text as well as the number of
2:51:33
links from that page now what this tells me is that this is most likely a
2:51:39
directory something that is listing all the different places that where you can buy products because it's most likely
2:51:46
the linking to the domain name seeing that there are no keywords being used in
2:51:52
Anchor text and also that there are 16 out about links from that page that
2:51:58
means that it must be a list of some sort and they are linking not only to me but most likely to competitors as well
2:52:06
so I can track my Links at the Domain level and at the page level I can look
2:52:11
to see which Pages might have more influence or relevance to my content I
2:52:17
can also see the link URL the page title if any keywords are being used in the
2:52:22
anchor text and also within the context of how many additional links are leaving
2:52:28
from that page if there are a high amount of outgoing links on that page then a link from that page might not be
2:52:36
as valuable since there are so many links the less links there are coming out from that page the more it will
2:52:44
benefit my site because I'm getting more benefit from less links
2:52:49
now also what I'm going to do is compare the link reports to my analytics I'm going to go to my analytics because
2:52:56
linking software does not show traffic it doesn't show how many people are
2:53:02
clicking on the link it only shows who's linking to you but it does not show visitor activity analytics will show you
2:53:09
visitor activity to see which domains are most effective in sending visitors
2:53:15
to your site if you'll go back to the primary benefits of linking visitors
2:53:21
branding and business analytics show me visitors and business it shows me which
2:53:28
domains are sending me visitors and which of those visitors are becoming customers
2:53:34
so what I can do is go to Google analytics look at all the domains that
2:53:39
are referring traffic to my site I can also click on the domain and see the
2:53:45
destination page that they are linking to I can see how many visitors are coming either monthly or annually how
2:53:52
often they're coming back whether they're new users or repeat users how long they stay how many pages they View
2:53:59
and how many conversions as a result of those visits this is a great way to get
2:54:06
a 360 degree view of your linking because not only do you want links that
2:54:12
will help you rank better you also want links that will send business and customers to you as well
2:54:19
building links can take many forms ideally it is through networks relationships and marketing that other
2:54:27
websites and users learn about you like you and recommend you to others
2:54:33
unfortunately there is a lot of bad outdated and untrustworthy advice to be
2:54:39
found about building links to your website in this section I'll present the best
2:54:45
practices as accepted by the omcp standard the objectives for this module that
2:54:53
you'll be able to develop a link building strategy that you'll understand the value of
2:54:59
different link types finally you'll be able to find inbound link opportunities
2:55:06
first step in building links is to evaluate what you have
2:55:11
now there are many tools available that you can utilize to do this for you there
2:55:17
are automated tools that you can get that will catalog all of the incoming
2:55:22
links to your website some of them are link decks Moz Raven or
2:55:29
Advanced Link manager there are many that can do that you may also want to
2:55:34
utilize your analytics as well in order to find websites that link to you
2:55:41
the first step is evaluating where you are right now
2:55:47
your incoming links have a significant impact on your rankings and you can do a lot of on-page
2:55:53
optimization and see some results however a lot of Google's algorithm
2:56:00
takes into account links from other high quality websites
2:56:06
now when you evaluate what you have in this example I'm showing you a screenshot from link decks
2:56:14
link decks catalogs the incoming links to my website and it groups them into
2:56:19
different areas the first way it groups them is by high value or high influence domains
2:56:27
those are websites that link to me that have a lot of influence not necessarily
2:56:34
in my industry but High influence based on the amount of people that link to
2:56:40
them as an authority on many different subjects the next way that it groups that is
2:56:48
based on relevance now this is when it looks at the match
2:56:53
of my content versus the content of the other website in the first example we can see the
2:57:01
National Library of Medicine it is a high influence website because
2:57:06
it is a government website with a lot of information that is cited frequently
2:57:12
because of the amount of other websites linking to that site it has a high
2:57:17
amount of influence now based on the website that I am measuring
2:57:23
there is a lot of keyword relevance meaning that that National Library of
2:57:29
Medicine site with the government has a lot of content that's very similar to my site a lot of the same keywords are
2:57:36
being used so not only is this website of high influence it also has a lot of relevance
2:57:43
and that's key when evaluating my backlinks I want to look at which websites are
2:57:50
also referring traffic so while I may have a link from the National Library of Medicine I want to
2:57:57
look at my analytics and look to see is it also providing visitors our visitors
2:58:04
following that link to my site and I also want to look at the quality of traffic that it produces
2:58:11
do these visitors stay longer than average do they convert more than average I want
2:58:18
to look at the quality of traffic based on the source next I want to look at the incoming
2:58:24
links from those other websites number one I want to make sure that the incoming link from the other site is
2:58:31
both accurate and relevant meaning the text that is used in the link is it
2:58:38
accurate to the content that will appear on the page when the visitor clicks that
2:58:43
link is the content relevant this is especially relevant if I have updated my
2:58:49
website changed the content or moved things around I want to be sure that that incoming
2:58:55
link sends visitors to the appropriate page and the appropriate information
2:59:02
I also want to ensure that that link is worded correctly that it uses the right
2:59:07
words that is sending visitors and setting expectations of the content that
2:59:13
they will see I may need to contact the website manager or owner and maybe ask for a
2:59:20
better linked text or a more accurate page destination
2:59:25
now this requires some interaction with the owner or manager of another website
2:59:31
and you always want to be respectful of their time and not demanding that they
2:59:37
make any changes in some cases the organization may be so big you may never find the right person
2:59:43
in order to optimize the text or the destination of that link
2:59:50
you always want to look for accuracy in cases where your company or website name
2:59:55
is utilized in the link but also if there is any contact information such as address phone number
3:00:02
a description of your business and any content make sure it's accurate and it all
3:00:09
points to the right place another way to look for links is to Simply go to a search engine and start
3:00:16
doing searches search for your company your business your company name and look for websites
3:00:24
that may mention you but do not have a live link to your website
3:00:30
many times your company will be mentioned or cited but there will not be a live link you can only find these
3:00:38
through doing searches and seeing which websites mention you without linking to
3:00:43
you now this could be an opportunity to get an Easy Link especially if you can find
3:00:49
some contact information and finding the right person that could add a link to
3:00:56
your company information again you'll need to be polite ask for their help and it will help it if you
3:01:04
can develop the link along with the link text and send that over
3:01:09
giving them just a quick and easy edit to be able to add the information
3:01:15
so make it as easy as possible as an example I've provided a sample
3:01:21
request format again you want to be polite you want to
3:01:26
be inviting and respectful of their time and their management
3:01:32
sometimes like I said you may find the right person that can help you however the larger the company the more
3:01:39
difficult it will be to make this happen this just requires your patience
3:01:45
and again being polite and not expecting the company to do what you are asking
3:01:53
many times this is just a formality and sometimes companies will act on it so be
3:02:00
sure to approach this with the right expectations the next thing I want to look at are
3:02:06
business listings these are the easy ways to establish links and ensure that
3:02:12
links are where they should be and also opportunities
3:02:18
look for business directories especially if your company has a local presence
3:02:23
you can utilize Chamber of Commerce lists Association lists or local
3:02:29
listings if they are on websites see if they offer links that can go to your website
3:02:36
rather than just the list of businesses that are in the area even on a larger level you can look for
3:02:43
associations directories or listings where you can add your business or
3:02:49
double check if your business is there and always ensure that your business
3:02:54
name address phone number and URL are correct complete and consistent with
3:03:02
other listings the next level will require some active
3:03:07
marketing and that's where you search for opportunities you can go out and look for other
3:03:13
resource lists within your industry or directories of businesses within your
3:03:18
industry and you can get a link many times through membership or submitting
3:03:24
your business as a resource however you may want to step up your marketing you can do that by
3:03:31
interviewing your clients seeing if they might be willing to provide a testimonial and a link to your website
3:03:39
you may also want to go out and find other communities online maybe some social communities that are relevant to
3:03:45
your industry get involved with those communities fill out a profile and get involved by
3:03:53
contributing information by sharing information you'll find that people like getting information and
3:04:01
they'll respond by linking to your site another option is to utilize the tool
3:04:08
that you had for indexing your links from the first step you can also add your competitors and you can look at
3:04:14
their backlinks you can look and see which websites and which domains are linking to your
3:04:20
competitors but you always need to go and see why what are those other sites
3:04:25
linking to and what is the nature of that link sometimes it may exclude you from being
3:04:33
able to approach competitors backlinks and ask them for links
3:04:39
however if they're being linked to by companies that are simply stating here
3:04:45
are vendors in this space and they are linking your competitors and you're not there
3:04:50
then it might make a lot of sense for you to approach and ask if you can be listed as well
3:04:56
however be sure that the links to your competitors are not from a consumer or
3:05:02
customer relationship in that case it might be out of line for you to ask for a link
3:05:09
make sure if you approach anyone who's linking to a competitor and asking for a
3:05:14
link to your site make sure the context is right and that it makes sense for them
3:05:20
and that's the ultimate judge of value does it benefit somebody else to link to
3:05:27
your site we all know that it will benefit you but when you present your link request you
3:05:34
need to offer value and the benefit for others to link to you
3:05:40
so be sure that you present it in a way that is beneficial and good for those people that will be
3:05:47
adding the link they're the ones that have to take the work to do it and they're also the ones that are adding a
3:05:54
recommendation for you and your business so as always you need to be considerate
3:06:00
and patient now the best way to build links is by
3:06:06
creating something that people like and sharing it you see the best way to build links is
3:06:14
by creating value through content or information or entertainment
3:06:21
you see when people like things they link to it if they find a study or a white paper or
3:06:28
research that you performed they link to it if you post a infographic that explains
3:06:35
something and it's attractive people link to it
3:06:40
you see that's what's most amazing about linking I find that when we put most of
3:06:47
our effort into creating content that people like that's what builds the most valuable and
3:06:55
the most relevant links and so what type of content well you can create infographics videos top 10 lists
3:07:03
or articles articles with advice or analysis of Market data or even research
3:07:10
that type of content people love it and so when you publish it out you utilize
3:07:16
social media to extend the reach and the visibility of that type of content
3:07:21
and when someone likes it they'll link to it and recommend it to others
3:07:27
now people also like depending upon your industry or your business they also like some personality maybe some humor
3:07:35
people always like expert information they like the cute this is why pictures
3:07:40
of cats tend to be liked and linked to more than almost anything else and also the unexpected
3:07:47
if you can inject any of that into your content that just makes it more valuable
3:07:54
more personable and again more shareable by other people and every time someone
3:08:01
shares it it builds a link to your site you see the best linking is when people
3:08:07
like something when you create something that people like and share you might be surprised at
3:08:13
the many opportunities there are to get links based on your content
3:08:20
I've seen many many blogs based on cooking fashion Arts Sports music
3:08:27
and when people specialize within a specific topic they always find an
3:08:32
audience and so anything they publish builds links even on certain social media sites such
3:08:40
as Pinterest people upload pictures on articles and
3:08:45
infographics especially about landscaping flowers food cars you name
3:08:51
it there is a special interest for anything and you can develop links from
3:08:56
those social sites to your site and it can generate traffic
3:09:02
even with a Blog developing articles that talk about upcoming events new
3:09:07
music Sports whatever it is when you create content that people like
3:09:13
it takes the longest amount of time to build content for building links when
3:09:18
you develop your own content that's the biggest investment you'll make in time
3:09:24
and research and writing and presentation however the result is that when you develop that
3:09:31
content you will receive the best and highest quality links and the most valuable
3:09:38
links are going to be to that content as I mentioned before one high quality
3:09:45
link can be worth more than hundreds or thousands of low quality links so my
3:09:52
best advice is to create content that people like that they link to
3:09:57
and that will be high value links that you'll generate to your site focus in on
Google Algorithms
3:10:03
so let's talk then now about how the Google algorithms work so we'll shift
3:10:08
gears here and we'll talk about how these algorithms work on Google so Google uses advanced concepts retrieve
3:10:15
data so what they do is they're spidering they're spidering they're collecting web pages and they're taking
3:10:21
all these web pages back to their server and anytime somebody does a query they're delivering those web pages
3:10:28
within milliseconds they're delivering results based on your query so that's in
3:10:34
general how it works so it uses a combination of different algorithms to deliver the best results they want the
3:10:41
best results and so some of the most popular algorithms below are Google
3:10:46
Panda Google penguin and Google rank brain so these are all things that
3:10:52
Google has done and to make sure that they're constantly tweaking their search engine is to deliver the best results so
3:11:00
let's talk about some of these these popular algorithms and before we talk about these popular algorithms let's
3:11:06
just make one thing clear that Google's always tweaking their algorithms on
3:11:13
their search engine and so if you want to get an idea how often they do it well they do it every day they're constantly
3:11:19
tweaking it but what they do is they release major changes to their algorithm a few times a year so if you want to get
3:11:26
a sense of what those changes look like well you could go to moz.com and you can
3:11:32
go to Google Dash algorithm Dash change and you can see here that hey Google
3:11:37
changes the search algorithm around 500 to 600 times while most of these are
3:11:43
minor Google again rolls out major changes like Panda like penguin that
3:11:49
affects search results in significant ways so you can go here and you can go all the way back to 2000 and see some of
3:11:56
the algorithm of them changes that have occurred over the last few years and you
3:12:02
can see here the last major one was done in August of 2018 that was the medic
3:12:08
core update so they're constantly making changes to their search engine to
3:12:13
deliver a more concise more better ecosystem for the end user so if it's a
3:12:20
better search engine for the end user end users are going to come back so the whole idea is continuing to tweak the
3:12:26
system that the algorithms to better show more accurate results and so let's
3:12:31
take a look at some of the the major algorithm changes that they've done in the past so the first is we'll talk
3:12:38
about Google Panda and Panda was an algorithm released back in 2011. so here
Google Panda
3:12:44
we are in 2019 is a few years ago but still significant in that really this
3:12:50
algorithm emphasized high quality content because before Panda there was a
3:12:56
there's just a lot of content out there on the internet and there was a lot of
3:13:01
spam content there are a lot of duplicate content and so really the idea behind panda is for Google to really
3:13:08
deliver in their search engine results Pages high quality content so what it did was it removed web pages that had
3:13:15
low quality or duplicate content so that was the whole idea behind you know the algorithm nickname Panda it removed low
3:13:22
quality and duplicate content and that kind of cleaned things up a bit where if you did a search query now you'd
3:13:29
actually see better better results and one thing about panda is because there's
3:13:35
so much quality because Google's indexing so much there on the internet that it's constantly being updated it's
3:13:42
updated regularly so the next one we're going to talk about is Google penguin so penguin was released after Panda and
Google Penguin
3:13:50
with that focused in on was low quality links so remember we talked about link
3:13:56
building we talk about quality links over quantity so naturally you're going
3:14:02
to have links naturally from all websites whether that be high quality or
3:14:07
low quality the whole idea behind this algorithm is to sever the links that are
3:14:14
low quality and so the idea behind that was they focused on two areas so they
3:14:20
focused in on Links games and keyword stuffing so that's what penguin focused on was link schemes were basically link
3:14:27
almost link farming where you produced Mass amounts of backlinks and not all of
3:14:33
them were good quality they weren't natural links links should be natural from one high quality site or blog to
3:14:40
another high quality cider blog and by creating lengths games you've created an ecosystem where links just went to
3:14:47
irrelevant low quality spam related pages and so Google's Penguins algorithm
3:14:53
update focused in on that effort to remove or combat pages that had poor
3:14:59
links from being indexed in their search engine results and then they also combated keyword stuffing keyword
3:15:05
stuffing is nothing more than taking your targeted keyword and stuffing it into the content of your page or title
3:15:12
tag your meta description so any sites that were caught up doing that basically suffer the consequences because what
3:15:19
penguin did was take care of sites that basically were accused of keyword
3:15:24
stuffing or had characteristics of keyword stuffing and they removed sites
3:15:30
that had a lot of links pointing to it from poor quality sites and vice versa sites that really had a lot of external
3:15:37
links pointing to other poor quality sites so that's what penguin did they took a look at those two areas and so we
3:15:45
talk about link schemes again penguin's aim was to decrease the ranking of web pages that created artificially by using
3:15:52
black hat techniques and basically what I mean by black hat techniques that artificially creating length that just
3:15:58
didn't make sense just for the sake of getting the backlink just for the sake of passing link juice and so that's what
3:16:05
a link scheme is or was and so Google basically tweaked their algorithm to
3:16:12
combat those poor link schemes and so keyword stuffing as I mentioned a minute
3:16:18
ago it's just repetitive usage of the same keyword and that just basically
3:16:23
suffers the content is the thing that suffers here and when the content suffers the end users suffer so Google
3:16:30
is all about quality content and when you have quality content and that quality contents indexed and users find
3:16:37
what they're looking for chances are they're going to go back to the search engine to continue to find what they're looking for with the end result being
3:16:44
presented with quality content so keyword stuffing really dilutes the quality of the content and then let's
3:16:51
talk about the third algorithm which is rank brain so rank brain is a processing
3:16:56
algorithm that uses is machine learning and what that does that machine learning interprets search queries that users
RankBrain
3:17:03
search on Google so for example if rankbrain sees a word or phrase it isn't
3:17:09
familiar with basically the machine can make a guess as to what words or phrases
3:17:14
might have a similar meaning and filter the result accordingly so basically take
3:17:19
these search engine queries and present them in a way that's logical so that the
3:17:25
end result can be something that's relevant to what you're looking for and so for example if you're searching for
3:17:31
online marketing you will get results related for digital marketing on search engine real Pages why because rankbrain
3:17:38
will interpret that particular keyword and they're trying to basically match based on all the data they collected
3:17:45
what words or phrases might have a similar meaning so online marketing digital marketing have similar meanings

detailed knowledge about how search engine works search engines mainly Works
3:21:39
in three steps crawling indexing and ranking let's have a look at each step
3:21:45
one by one so first let's start with crawling search engines are hungry for content
3:21:52
and so they send Web spiders or web crawlers also known as robots or search
3:21:59
engine Bots to discover new content or any updated content
3:22:05
content can be an image a web page a video or anything else present on the
3:22:12
web this process is known as crawling now let's know about indexing
3:22:20
as soon as the crawler discovered the updated content or new content
3:22:25
these web crawlers start storing the URLs of the content into the search
3:22:32
index or web Index this process is known as indexing once the content is indexed
3:22:39
it starts appearing in the search result pages when a user enters a search query the
3:22:46
most relevant results are taken from the index and displayed in the form of most
3:22:53
relevant to least relevant in the search result Pages this process is known as
3:22:59
ranking now that we have gained knowledge about how search engine works
3:23:04
here I have a question for you choose the correct option with respect
3:23:11
to working of search engines you need to choose the option for all
3:23:16
the steps of how search engines work option A indexing crawling ranking
3:23:22
option b ranking indexing crawling option C crawling indexing ranking and
3:23:31
option D crawling ranking and indexing let us know your answer in the comment
3:23:39
section below now let's get started by learning how
3:23:45
search console actually works search console is a primary source of
3:23:51
information that helps search engine Bots to crawl index and rank the pages
3:23:58
of your website thereby allowing the website owners to
3:24:04
monitor the health of your website all you need to do is integrate search
3:24:10
console with your website and get the ownership allow the search engine Bots to crawl
3:24:17
your website and index the pages also don't forget to submit your website
3:24:23
sitemap to search engines submitting sitemaps helps the crawler to discover
3:24:29
more pages of your website thereby understanding your site's
3:24:35
architecture we will know how it is done in the upcoming part of the video
3:24:40
also you need to keep an eye on the errors suggested by search console and
3:24:45
solve them else it may harm the ranking of your website now let me remind you that all the
3:24:52
reports that are generated in search console are based on the activity of the
3:24:58
web Crawlers on your website now let's understand various parameters and
3:25:04
terminologies from search console to get a complete understanding of this
3:25:11
webmaster tool so without any further delay let's start
3:25:16
understanding the basic terminologies of Google search console and how they work
3:25:23
and improve your website's Health the first one we have is performance
3:25:29
reports Google search console provides two types of performance report search reports and
3:25:36
discover reports let's first understand about search reports
3:25:44
search reports help to analyze the search performance of your website
3:25:50
search performance reports include metrics and dimensions so let's first focus on metrics
3:25:58
here there are four types of metrics as you can see in this image the metrics
3:26:05
include the total clicks or I must say clicks Impressions average CTR and
3:26:12
average position Impressions provides the data on how
3:26:18
many times your websites appears in the search results as you can see here the graph shows the
3:26:25
number of times this website has appeared in the search results the next metric we have is clicks
3:26:34
clicks provide the data on the total number of times users clicked from the
3:26:39
search results and reached your website the graph below shows the number of
3:26:45
times the users have clicked from search results and they have arrived on any
3:26:51
page of my website so suppose if here is a number 200 so we can definitely get an
3:26:58
idea for very number of dates number of dates provided on the x-axis which shows that
3:27:06
how many times the user has clicked and arrived on the website and the number
3:27:13
various varies from between like 200 200 uh 250 300 and in between 250 to 300.
3:27:23
and the next metric we have is average CTR average CTR or click-through rate is
3:27:30
the percentage of Impressions that results in clicks in the same manner the graph below shows
3:27:37
or the average CTR for various different dates the next metric we have is average
3:27:44
position the average position represents the data about the average position of
3:27:50
the sites in the search results it is possible that your website is
3:27:56
ranking today at number one position so it may rank tomorrow at 3 some other day
3:28:01
at 4 some other day at 9 or 10 and again it may rank to the one so this data
3:28:07
actually provides the detail about the average position which your website
3:28:13
frequently ranks at so that is if it is ranking at one two and three in between
3:28:18
one two and three positions so the average position may be two now understanding about the dimensions
3:28:26
dimensions are the data attribute that defines who did something on your site
3:28:32
or from where here is the list of dimensions on which
3:28:37
the dimension performance reports are generated that is countries Pages queries devices search
3:28:46
appearance and dates the dimension country suggests the
3:28:52
country from which the search came as you can see here from the left column
3:28:58
you can get the list of number of countries from the right side you can get the idea about the clicks impression
3:29:04
ctrn position that is all the metrics related to that query uh from which the
3:29:11
search came from or from that location or whatever the activity has happened
3:29:17
from that location next we have is the dimensions Pages Pages show the pages
3:29:23
clicked by user or a page that is viewed on a search so this this actually you
3:29:31
get the reports from the search consoled in the form of the links where you get the link which is the exact page that is
3:29:38
viewed on the search if there exists duplicate pages on the site then only one canonical page or
3:29:46
canonical link will be displayed by the search engines out of the number of duplicate pages so basically canonical
3:29:54
links are those links uh like if there are suppose there is a one original page
3:29:59
and there are two three duplicate page of the same page so what happens uh the
3:30:05
original page gains the canonical link and uh this page has more value than the
3:30:10
duplicate pages so whenever the search engine will crawl your website or the duplicate pages may
3:30:18
be ignored and all its uh link juice or link Equity or anything will be
3:30:23
completely taken for the original page moving ahead to queries
3:30:30
queries provide the query string that users search on the Google search console
3:30:36
so Suppose there is a website it says suppose uh let's talk about the simply learn website so suppose a user may add
3:30:44
as Java course and simply learn websites appears at second or third position so
3:30:50
this query so suppose user clicks on the website and reaches the website this
3:30:55
query Java course on simply learn or Java course will add in the search
3:31:00
console showing that the user has reached to your website using this query
3:31:06
Java course and again all the list of the queries appears towards the left and
3:31:11
all the matrixes for that query like clicks impression CTR and its average
3:31:16
position is appeared towards the right in the search console now talking about
3:31:22
the search appearance search appearance helps in grouping the data as per the
3:31:28
search result type or by the feature so you can get here the number of search
3:31:33
appearance and again the same metrics as with respect back to the search appearance criteria next let's move
3:31:40
towards the dates groups of data as per the dates according to the public time zones now
3:31:47
let's have a look over the Discover performance report now here you must be thinking about how
3:31:54
the search is different from discover yes search and discover follow different
3:32:01
approaches users enter a query to find a required information with search
3:32:08
whereas discover shows the content based on what result will be best match for
3:32:15
your query as per the Google's automated system now coming to the Discover performance
3:32:22
report as per Google's guidelines discover performance reports are visible
3:32:27
only if your website has a minimum threshold of impressions in discover
3:32:34
now moving to another important parameter of search console which is URL
3:32:40
inspection URL inspection is an interesting tool in
3:32:45
the search console this tool allows you to inspect whether the URL is indexable
3:32:52
or not some main functions of this tool includes
3:32:59
checking the current status of the URL inspecting live URLs requesting indexing
3:33:06
for a URL viewing Pages rendered version viewing
3:33:12
crawl Pages viewing tested Pages Etc
3:33:17
in order to check the index status of URL open the URL inspection tool
3:33:27
and add the complete URL for which we need to know its indexing status
3:33:34
now to understand the results check the present status if it shows that URL is
3:33:40
on Google as you can see in the screen this means that URL qualifies Google's
3:33:47
criteria and is eligible to appear in search results if it shows URL is not on Google then
3:33:56
the URL does not qualify the Google's criteria and is not eligible to appear
3:34:02
in search results you can check more details like URL Discovery crawl and indexing information
3:34:09
from the page availability tab click on the crawl page to see the
3:34:15
information about the HTTP request and response if you find that the link is
3:34:21
disabled just hover over the page to check the reason now coming to the live URL test
3:34:31
it is helpful to test the live URL and check if it is capable of being indexed
3:34:38
it proves helpful when you update your page and want to compare it with its
3:34:44
latest indexed version just to bring it to your notice a life test will only confirm whether
3:34:51
the Google crawler can access your page for indexing but it doesn't assure that
3:34:58
your page will be included in the Google index altogether with the help of index
3:35:04
coverage report one can find the list of URLs which includes the URLs Google has
3:35:10
found on your website the URLs that have been indexed and identify if any
3:35:17
indexing problem have occurred next we move ahead to understand about the site
3:35:23
Maps the site map is the file that contains all the information of pages on your
3:35:30
website this helps search engine crawlers to crawl your website and understand your
3:35:37
website structure and helps them to index the pages more efficiently
3:35:44
more the crawler indexes your pages higher the chances for the pages of your
3:35:49
website to appear in the search results with the help of site maps you can
3:35:55
provide information about various contents like Pages videos images
3:36:01
Etc as you can understand a sitemap plays an important role in indexing
3:36:07
process you must be curious to know how we can create and submit a site map to search
3:36:13
engines before we understand this process make sure that all pages of your website are
3:36:21
linked in an appropriate manner with each other thereby maintaining a healthy
3:36:27
site structure a site map can be created in XML format RSS format or in text
3:36:35
format it can be Auto generated or created manually as well most commonly used
3:36:43
sitemap is XML following is an example of an XML site
3:36:49
map this is the simplest version of the sitemap that we are representing here
3:36:55
you can submit a site map to the sitemap reports in the search console
3:37:00
however site Maps can also be submitted through robots.txt file let's understand
3:37:07
about robots.txt file so let's understand the robots.txt file
3:37:15
in short robots.txt file notifies the web
3:37:20
Crawlers about the URLs that they can access on the website as there are lots of search
3:37:27
engines there exists different web crawlers thus there is a possibility
3:37:33
that some web crawlers may not obey the instructions from the robots.txt file it
3:37:40
is necessary to know how to use the proper syntax as different crawlers
3:37:45
understand syntax differently thus there are chances that some web
3:37:51
crawlers might fail to understand the instructions from the robots.txt file
3:37:58
a page can be indexed even if it is disallowed from the robots.txt file if
3:38:05
it is linked to other site next let's know what enhancement reports
3:38:13
are all the rich results status reports are displayed under the enhancement tab
3:38:20
so let's know more about rich results these type of results are known as Rich
3:38:26
results in serps so basically Rich results can be any search results other
3:38:33
than the traditional Blue Links for example image results carousels
3:38:39
Etc you can check whether the pages from your website support Rich results or not
3:38:45
using the rich result test tool provided by Google Developers
3:38:52
now understanding the rich results status report the enhancement tab
3:38:57
contains separate reports for Rich result type some rich result report types are listed
3:39:04
below that are breadcrumbs education q a event FAQ fact check
3:39:12
guided recipe how to image license
3:39:17
job posting learning video review Snippets
3:39:23
Etc Rich results status reports consist of summary page and Details page
3:39:31
the summary page mainly consists of Errors useful items found on your
3:39:37
website warnings Etc The Details page consists of the
3:39:43
information about the issues when it was detected item type when was the page
3:39:50
last crawled Etc before we understand how to fix
3:39:55
error in search console it is important to understand the status of each page as
3:40:02
reported by search console each page has any of the following
3:40:07
status error warning excluded and valid if the status of the page is valid it
3:40:15
means the page has successfully indexed the status of the page appears to be
3:40:22
excluded if one purposefully wants the page not to be indexed
3:40:28
or a page is blocked by robots.txt file for example setting the meta tag to no
3:40:35
index warnings majorly appears when the page of your website is indexed but
3:40:43
there are some issues with the page which needs your attention and have to
3:40:49
be resolved as soon as possible if the page status is error then there
3:40:56
is a need to pay a detailed attention over the issues in the page as these
3:41:02
issues prevent the page from getting indexed
3:41:07
let's discuss about the errors in detail and how we can fix them
3:41:13
some popular errors from the search console are listed below
3:41:19
that is the redirect error server error submitted URLs blocked by robots.txt URL
3:41:27
marked as no index submitted URL is a soft pore not for not poor or page not
3:41:34
found error so let's first know about the redirect error some redirect error
3:41:43
that search console shows up are the redirect chain that was too long
3:41:48
redirect true redirect URL that exits maximum URL
3:41:54
length and bat or empty URL in the redirect chain so all these error means
3:42:01
that the redirections are not working properly and so there is a need to fix
3:42:07
them so suppose for example you have added too many redirects from one page
3:42:13
to another so in this scenario search engine Bots find it a waste of
3:42:19
time to crawl again and again to the same redirections and at that time the
3:42:25
search engine crawlers or search engine boards ignore those URLs or redirections
3:42:30
so in such cases you need to fix those redirection to a single URL
3:42:36
the next we have is server error the server returns 5xx error when it
3:42:43
fails to fulfill a valid request this error mainly conveys that something is
3:42:49
wrong with your website server all you need to do is reach out to your hosting
3:42:55
services and inform them about the issue and make sure it gets resolved as soon
3:43:01
as possible the next one we have is submitted URL blocked by robots.txt to resolve this
3:43:10
issue you need to remove the line of code from the robot.txt file that
3:43:16
restricts Google from crawling the respective page the next we have is URL
3:43:23
marked as no index when a URL is marked as no index it
3:43:29
sends the signal to crawlers that this page is not meant to be crawled or this
3:43:35
page is not meant to be indexed if you want this page to be indexed check the
3:43:41
metadata and remove the no index attribute to allow the Crawlers to crawl the URL
3:43:48
now let's understand about the error submitted URL is a soft 404 and 404 or
3:43:57
page not found error whenever a web page load server returns a 200 signal showing
3:44:04
the success status code soft4 Note 4 is a condition in which server returns 200
3:44:11
success status code and the page not exist error simultaneously
3:44:17
this is considered to be a bad user experience this error can be solved simply by
3:44:24
redirecting this page to any relevant URL or the home page of the website
3:44:31
talking about 404 or page not bound error this error mainly occurs
3:44:39
when you delete the page from your website but the URL of the page still
3:44:44
exists in the site map this error can be solved by simply
3:44:51
removing the URL or removing the four not four URL from the site map or
3:44:57
redirecting the URL to a new page this will help to avoid the further
3:45:03
errors in near future we will have a detailed look at other 4xx errors in the upcoming videos
3:45:11
now that we are aware of the basics of search console let's dive deeper to know
3:45:18
some stats regarding the search console in the SEO industry
3:45:24
when you're thinking of adding a business online your website should fulfill all the technical SEO needs
3:45:31
which can be achieved by Google search console thus there is a huge demand in
3:45:38
SEO industry for the candidates having strong knowledge of Google search console the average salary of an SEO
3:45:46
expert with the Google search console skills in US is 53 000 dollars
3:45:56
to seventy eight thousand dollars per annum and that in India is 2 lakh 76 000
3:46:04
per annum some biggies in the SEO industry looking
3:46:09
for this skill sets include Accenture Amazon people group
3:46:15
Eton Etc so let me know your dream company to work as an SEO expert in the comment
3:46:22
section below the search engines have put massive resources into developing the visibility
Local SEO
3:46:28
of local and Regional businesses in the search results in addition the massive increase and
3:46:34
prevalence of smartphones over the past few years have made location-based searches and expected everyday
3:46:41
occurrence people expect to find results based on where they are immediately
3:46:46
here's the basic idea behind local now for a long time in the past search
3:46:52
engines wanted to be able to provide results based on where you were in the world in a very precise way
3:46:58
they were able to use this somewhat by using the IP address and they could
3:47:04
approximate where you were but it wasn't always that accurate what they really wanted to know is where you exactly were
3:47:11
within feet or meters now this technology has evolved considerably and in a very short amount
3:47:18
of time using location technology like GPS and Wi-Fi in addition the prevalence of searching
3:47:25
on smartphones accounts for more than 60 percent of searches every day these
3:47:31
factors now enable search engines to know your location and provide incredibly accurate and thorough options
3:47:37
for your search so what's at the core of this well it's
3:47:43
the acronym nap it stands for name address and phone number
3:47:49
this is the most critical factor for any business not just in local SEO but for
3:47:54
local it is critically important all you need to do is on your website
3:48:00
specify one name for your business one address and one phone number
3:48:06
and then when you put that into different directories like Yelp or Yellow Pages or whatever you may be
3:48:11
using you need to make sure that you have exactly letter four letter the same name
3:48:18
and the same address and the same phone number unfortunately this gets
3:48:23
convoluted because the search engine spiders index and classify information
3:48:29
business information can be classified separately all because of the slightest
3:48:35
variation in business name or address making it look like a separate business
3:48:42
now a human would easily be able to identify the difference and classify the variations as a single business
3:48:49
search engines can't do that yet start on your own website specify one name for
3:48:55
your business one address format and one phone number and then use that same identical name and format when you set
3:49:01
up your accounts at different websites and directories like Yelp or yellow pages
3:49:07
you need to make sure you have exactly letter for letter the same name the same address and the same phone number
3:49:14
unfortunately this can be difficult there are a lot of different formats for
3:49:20
phone numbers certainly for addresses and even for names any inconsistency will cause problems
3:49:27
again a human might be able to figure this out easily but using the examples a
3:49:32
search engine would consider this two separate businesses at the same address
3:49:38
or because the address format is different it may even be considered two different businesses at two different
3:49:44
addresses do you see how that works so search engines do not usually know
3:49:50
that they're the same business and this causes all kinds of problems
3:49:56
so let's pretend that your address is one two three Happy Street Suite 3.
3:50:02
there's a lot of different ways you could write this you could spell out sweet you could use just the
3:50:08
abbreviation for it and there's actually two abbreviations for sweet you could also use unit instead of sweet
3:50:16
but Suite numbers and abbreviations are where people lose their consistency even with Road Street Parkway or Avenue
3:50:23
you need to pick just one version spell It And format it exactly the same and use it consistently then find all the
3:50:31
instances of different variations you have online and go fix them
3:50:36
the last part of this is directories so directories for a while now has been
3:50:42
a bit of a bad word it used to be a great way of doing SEO until it got abused
3:50:49
in fact it got abused and overused and abuse was that people would charge a lot
3:50:55
of money so that you could be listed in a directory and now in modern days directories are not like they used to be
3:51:01
and they're not that useful getting links that way and doing link building through directories is not
3:51:07
going to be greatly helpful however the big exception to this is with local SEO
3:51:14
there are important iyps internet Yellow Pages there are also things like Yelp or
3:51:21
Urban Spoon where people go and submit their local businesses real human beings pick up their phone
3:51:28
and they go to the Yelp app and look for businesses and because real human beings are using these unlike the directories
3:51:34
of the past this means that you want to have your business there so in some ways directories at least in
3:51:41
the local space have returned a great example of this are local or even
3:51:46
National Business associations Chambers of Commerce business associations industry associations and
3:51:54
other directories can be good places now after all that let's move on to some
3:52:00
other local signals so the first most important signal is This Acronym again an AP name address
3:52:07
and phone number the key here is that consistency
3:52:12
the next thing is keywords and titles this is extremely convenient because
3:52:17
it's something you should be doing for SEO anyway this is particular for title tags which
3:52:24
is something we've covered in the other videos the next one is domain Authority so if
3:52:30
you have an important domain an important business Google is going to use this as a signal when they're doing
3:52:36
a traditional local search so when someone's on their mobile and
3:52:41
they're looking for a good restaurant if you are an important restaurant in the
3:52:47
city you're going to be more popular in both local search and traditional search
3:52:53
that's domain Authority the next one is inbound link signals this again might
3:52:59
sound familiar the things that help you for traditional SEO do the same for local the first one is Anchor text
3:53:07
so this is one of the most important if you're a great restaurant hopefully you're going to have lots of bloggers
3:53:13
lots of magazines and local online entities that are writing about you and
3:53:19
linking to you they're naturally going to use your name and the name of your business in the
3:53:25
review about you these are the kinds of things that Google is looking for because these are
3:53:31
what is effective online the last one is reviews and citations
3:53:39
but in this context these have very specific definitions it's not just reviews in general like
3:53:47
the ones I've talked about it's reviews on specific local directories or business listings
3:53:53
and it's both the quality of them are you getting five stars and the quantity
3:53:59
of them do you have a hundred reviews do 100 people care enough about your business to review you now the next one
3:54:05
is a bit more complex as it does require some programming on your website this is called schema microdata or structured
3:54:13
data schema is an agreed upon programming standard by search engines
3:54:18
browsers and device manufacturers that directs the markup and display of
3:54:23
specific content it's typically content that is repetitive by nature and therefore if
3:54:30
it's displayed in a consistent manner for all devices browsers and operating systems to know the content then they
3:54:37
can display it properly you'll find it in addresses contact cards dates
3:54:42
e-commerce products reviews people places creative works and more
3:54:47
what we're most concerned with here is the address and phone number by using schema when you add your address or
3:54:54
phone number to your website it enables the visitor to use the click to call function on their phone when there's a
3:55:01
phone number on the website in addition using the address schema can open up a map when someone clicks on it to show
3:55:07
the location utilizing this schema provides clear data to the search engine that can be republished across a variety
3:55:14
of channels now specifically for Google's business listings they give a very wide range of content for
3:55:20
businesses to list so fill out as many areas of the business listing as you can business hours payment types accepted
3:55:27
phone numbers descriptions reviews from Google and maybe even from your own website you can link your social
3:55:34
profiles and any events or promotions you have one of the biggest signals that we've seen grow in importance are the
3:55:40
amount of pictures that you load into your business listings in fact Google provides a report as to how many times
3:55:46
the photos are viewed by Searchers many times businesses that have many photos
3:55:52
will show up with more prominence than those that have little or no photos so
3:55:57
take advantage of the listing opportunities that Google provides finally the same behavioral signals that
3:56:04
are used in search are also used in the local search results and this is because the search engines especially Google can
3:56:11
see how Searchers interact with your local listing because it is in their
3:56:17
system the behavioral signals start with how many people search for your business this is directly related to your local
3:56:24
visibility and loyalty so don't forget about your local offline marketing next
3:56:29
they measure how long someone views your listing they count how many times the phone number is clicked for someone to
3:56:36
call or when someone clicks to find directions in addition there's a button
3:56:42
there for directions to be sent to a searcher's phone if they're using a PC or laptop all of these engagement
3:56:48
factors and buttons on a business listing are counted as engagement and task completion which increases the
3:56:55
behavioral signals for your business as people save the listing check in or even visit these all send important
3:57:02
behavioral signals of popularity and loyalty which contributes to your business's visibility and local search
3:57:10
before I tell you how to bring traffic to your website let me tell you why this is so important okay why do we want to
3:57:17
bring users to our website I mean it has to be on equal ground as web development
3:57:22
and design is somebody who goes to your site and then does something when they get to your site so you have users and
3:57:30
when those users get to your site they're generating page views and traffic and you want to turn that
3:57:36
traffic into engagement okay so each Page's traffic is configured independently of all their pages so when
3:57:44
you go when somebody goes to your website they look at a page that's a page view and certain pages on your
3:57:49
website you want to turn that page view into a conversion okay whether that be you know looking at a video or
3:57:56
purchasing something so think of these pages on your website as salespeople they're trying to convert visitors who
3:58:02
come to your website but first we need to get the visitors to your website so when you give visitors to your website
3:58:09
again you can generate rate sales which means revenue or you can increase brand
3:58:15
awareness or you can earn Revenue through sponsored post and advertisements so if you have for
3:58:21
example a lot of content on your website you can turn that in to revenue by
3:58:26
hosting ads on your website so when somebody clicks on that ad you're going to earn a percentage of that click okay
3:58:32
what that click is worth so having a website means a lot of good things for
3:58:38
you but first you got to get the traffic there and so what we're going to do is we're going to tell you how to drive
3:58:45
traffic to your website so there's lots of different ways in which you can bring traffic to your website well the first
3:58:52
is paid advertising so paying to advertise your products services with ads is one of the easiest ways to drive
3:58:59
traffic to your website so some of the options available are search ads social
3:59:05
media ads or display ads so search ads or ads that are displayed in the search
3:59:10
engine and results so when a user types in a keyword query you want your ad to
3:59:16
show up based on that keyword query okay so an example is digital marketing course somebody types in digital
3:59:23
marketing course and simply learn is the first app that shows up how do we know it's an ad because you can see the word
3:59:30
add next to the domain so when somebody clicks on that link simply learn is
3:59:35
going to pay Google so that's how search advertising works okay the next is
3:59:40
social it's a social media marketing involves increasing traffic or engagement or brand awareness lots of
3:59:47
different strategies but you're instead of doing this on search you're doing it on a social media platform okay so for
3:59:54
example you can advertise on any particular platform and the way you
4:00:00
advertise could be with an image it could be with a video so in this case you could see cobrio is doing a
4:00:08
sponsored ad here how to succeed with Google flats and then another form of advertising is display so display means
4:00:16
creating ads that are placed on specific websites so with display unlike search
4:00:22
you have a choice in the ad format with search you only have text ads but with display you have text Edge image ads
4:00:29
rich media ads video ads so you have lots of different options in which you
4:00:34
can advertise on other websites so the idea here is to get your ad in front of
4:00:41
the Right audience when they could see your display Banner your banner ad then it's going to be more visual more
4:00:48
appealing generate some brand interest and hopefully you can get somebody to click on that ad and over to your
4:00:53
website so that's paid advertising again through search through social through display but you can also promote your
4:01:01
site on social media so once your content is gone live you could take advantage of different social media
4:01:07
platforms I mean it really depends on what you're you're trying to promote because what you're trying to promote
4:01:13
needs to align with the appropriate social media platform so Facebook is
4:01:18
best suited for Industries like food and Beverages and news and media and if you're selling a product so you fall
4:01:25
into one of those categories and Facebook could be the right platform for you if you're involved in again beauty
4:01:31
or food and beverage or e-commerce then you can also leverage Instagram which is
4:01:36
part of Facebook's ecosystem so if you advertise on Facebook you can also
4:01:42
advertise on Instagram and or Instagram so it doesn't have to be and Facebook
4:01:47
and Instagram it could be Facebook or Instagram you also have LinkedIn as a platform LinkedIn is great for B2B so if
4:01:55
you're trying to promote industry news or or tips and best practices or job
4:02:00
postings then LinkedIn is the place for you it's a B2B platform it's great for
4:02:06
targeting specific Industries targeting specific job levels or job descriptions
4:02:13
okay so LinkedIn is great if you're into B2B focusing on the business side of it
4:02:18
so you also have YouTube now YouTube is part of Google's ecosystem YouTube is a
4:02:24
video platform okay so it's great if you're trying to promote gaming or
4:02:30
entertainment or if you're a vlogger okay so YouTube's a great way to promote
4:02:35
your site by getting your product out there in the form of a video and then you have Twitter Twitter to me
4:02:41
encompasses a lot of different Industries Beauty and fitness news and media entertainment okay you have
4:02:48
limited number of characters but a lot of people are active on Twitter and it's
4:02:54
a great way to generate some awareness and get some clicks over to your website so these are just some of the most
4:02:59
popular social media platforms of course there are plenty more out there the third way in which you can drive traffic
4:03:06
to your site is guest plus blogging so most of you already know what blogging's
4:03:11
all about well if you're blogging for your own site you can jump on somebody else's site and blog on their behalf so
4:03:18
having the opportunity to guess post on another website can be very helpful because one that other blog could have
4:03:25
lots of traffic and have a a well-known brand so if you're blogging on another blog it's going to build your brand
4:03:32
awareness and potentially increase traffic to your blog or website so it exposes to you to targeted traffic so if
4:03:40
you're going to guest blog guest blog on a site that's very relevant to your business or industry that way you're
4:03:46
targeting the Right audience okay you can expand your personal Network so getting yourself out there getting your
4:03:53
brand out there in front of a different audience and then obviously for service because it generates backlinks or serps
4:03:59
search engine ranking Pages means that hey if you want to rank organically you're going to have to generate some
4:04:06
backlinks so guest blogging isn't a way to generate some back links to your site
4:04:12
and in effect that's going to help you get your pages ranked higher because Google is going to recognize the
4:04:18
relationship from one blog to your blog and build up your relevancy so some
4:04:24
other benefits here to guest blogging is you can grow your social media following
4:04:30
because you can then promote that on social media that you're guest blogging okay again you can improve your online
4:04:36
Authority okay because when you're guest blogging and you have recognition on
4:04:42
that Guest block if it's a popular blog then it's going to help your domain and Page Authority for SEO and then the end
4:04:48
result is going to improve your backlink score so the lot of benefits to guest blogging to me at the end of the day
4:04:55
it's just about reaching out to your audience using another platform to do that in the form of a Blog and the
4:05:01
results of that is going to mean more brand awareness for you and turning that traffic from that other blog into
4:05:08
qualified leads so you can also in interview industry thought leader so that's another way an interesting way to
4:05:15
generate traffic to your site so reaching out to thought leaders for interviews okay could generate some
4:05:21
credibility for you and the other person so it's reciprocal so it means that you're active in the industry that
4:05:27
you're in and it allows you to engage with other leaders in the industry and
4:05:33
the indirect net result of that could be increased traffic because if you do the interview and you record it or if it's
4:05:40
via video then you can obviously post it on other platforms and that could in turn Drive traffic to your website
4:05:46
obviously just like guest blogging it's going to increase your reach so getting
4:05:52
yourself out there nobody knows who your brand is and they know who the thought leaders are and they say you're
4:05:58
interviewing the thought leaders then that's going to put you in front of these people and so it's going to
4:06:04
increase your reach another way to drive traffic to your website is just to make sure your website's response and what do
4:06:11
we mean by responsive well we mean does it work on multiple devices specifically
4:06:16
MOBA so depending on the device your website hides shows shrinks and larges
4:06:22
or moves content so that it conforms to the browser that that person's looking
4:06:28
at on your web for your website so if somebody's looking on mobile at your website you want to make sure that your
4:06:35
website adjusts accordingly so you want to be able to you know test to make sure it's responsive and so as content range
4:06:42
based on importance okay does it work across different browsers on different devices and do the images text and
4:06:50
everything else align just like it does on desktop so there are plenty of tools out there on the web all you need to do
4:06:56
is just do a search for you know check my website for responsiveness you know so you you can use plenty of tools to
4:07:03
check to see if your website is responsive towards multiple devices why
4:07:09
is that important because as some somebody goes to your website Via Mobile and your site doesn't align properly or
4:07:15
the content's all stretched out and somebody has to maneuver their browser just to see your website then chances
4:07:22
are they're not going to come back chances are they're not going to convert okay so you want to be able to revise
4:07:28
your device browser combinations you want to make sure that everything works accordingly you want to be able to test
4:07:34
those fonts make sure they look good and then you also want to make sure that
4:07:39
people can navigate so if they're on mobile are they going to navigate just as easy as they can on desktop and if
4:07:47
you have any pop-ups you want to probably make sure they're removed so that way when somebody's looking at your
4:07:53
website they're not getting interfered with on mobile and then of course you
4:07:58
want to make sure that these Pages load okay so they load just as quick on
4:08:03
desktop as they should on mobile and vice versa so this should not take a long time to load so I'm moving on from
4:08:11
responsiveness on mobile to building a brand community so brand community refers to a group of people who identify
4:08:18
your brand and use your brand as a platform to exchange ideas and contribute content some advantages of
4:08:25
having a brand Community are promoting brand evangelism and loyalty it can be a
4:08:31
source of feedback loyalty and ideas so build a community build a brand Community who you know identify with you
4:08:39
okay so continue to you know treat these people as loyal customers okay maybe
4:08:45
give them a promotion uh to use specifically just for them that they can use on your website or talk directly to
4:08:52
them because you know that they're followers they're repeat customers they purchase for you multiple times so talk
4:08:59
to them differently as well you know who these people are and that's what building a brand is all about it's about
4:09:05
identifying your brand with other people okay in an identify people who identify
4:09:11
with your brand and messaging and talking to them as if they're part of your own Community your own family so
4:09:18
you can use user generated content that provides future marketing strategies so
4:09:24
the feedback you get from your own Community could be in turn used to
4:09:29
promote or used in future marketing strategies I.E advertising I.E post on
4:09:36
social okay it can also provide PR opportunities so it's a chance for you to you know put out press releases based
4:09:43
on the community that you built so any brand regardless of who it is should be
4:09:49
able to identify with your audience their target audience and that target audience eventually going to become part
4:09:56
of a community these are group of people who identify with you what you're trying to sell what your cause is what your
4:10:03
mission statement is what your services they identify with you so leverage them
4:10:08
and reciprocate identify them talk to them separately give them the what they
4:10:15
deserve the respect and loyalty that they deserve as well because they're communicating and they're following you
4:10:22
as a brand so the next thing you could do to drive traffic is Be Active in the
4:10:27
comments section so engage in relevant and thought-provoking conversations on
4:10:32
other blogs and sites it doesn't necessarily have to be another blog per se it could be other sites like Reddit
4:10:38
or Cora or Mania sites that have a lot of content that are broken out by
4:10:44
industry that allow you to engage in conversation and allow you to either upvote or share or respond okay so be
4:10:53
active because when you're active people are going to see that hey you're a leader in the industry you know what
4:10:59
you're talking about you have some some brand Equity you have some thought and
4:11:04
some knowledge on the specific topic and subjects so it just puts you in a better
4:11:09
light when you can respond and be active on these different platforms okay let's
4:11:14
turn our attention to search engine optimization also known as SEO or
4:11:20
organic search so in order to drive traffic to your site you're going to have to implement an SEO strategy why do
4:11:29
you want to implement an SEO strategy because it can help you improve your overall searchability and visibility on
4:11:36
search engines and obviously that comes with advantages one of those advantages is obviously more traffic to the site
4:11:42
search is still King in terms of volumes of people using search on a daily basis
4:11:49
so you have a great opportunity to be found it also builds trust and credibility because still a majority of
4:11:55
the people who do a search click on an organic search list in and so if you're
4:12:01
found organically and you're ranked number one then chances are somebody's
4:12:06
going to click on your listing and it provides increasing engagement and traffic and so what that means is more
4:12:13
traffic more engagement and engagement is something you define it could be again a download of a document or the
4:12:20
clicking on the play button of a video or or submitting a form or signing up
4:12:25
for a newsletter or calling these are all forms of Engagement so the the
4:12:31
amount of traffic you drive from organic search to your website is only going to
4:12:36
improve engagement okay so you can also provide an improve user experience and
4:12:42
what do we mean by that well if you're getting lots of traffic from organic search you have a really good
4:12:48
opportunity to do a b testing and when you do a b testing you can improve user
4:12:54
experience meaning you're showing one variation against the other from people coming from organic search and so this
4:13:00
is helpful in that you know if you're running an A B test the variation has a
4:13:06
chance to improve or outperform the original original and if it outperforms the original you're improving user
4:13:13
experience and then it helps Target quality traffic so SEO to me or all search is the only medium in which
4:13:20
you're meeting somebody halfway you're you're addressing what they're looking for so somebody's looking for a pair of
4:13:26
red women's Nike shoes the 2019 model
4:13:31
and you have that particular product to offer well you have a chance of showing
4:13:37
up via organic search somebody types in you know women's red Nike shoes size
4:13:43
whatever at the year 2019 model then of course they're gonna probably likely
4:13:49
click on your listing because you have what they're looking for and and that goes with any keyword any industry any
4:13:56
business any segment any type of product you're selling so again you have a
4:14:02
chance to really be visible for what people are looking for and so that's the beauty of search engine optimization you
4:14:08
have a really good opportunity here to meet people halfway to drive quality
4:14:14
traffic to get them to enjoy a good user experience all the while generating
4:14:19
engagement and along with SEO we want to be able to build backlinks so SEO is a
4:14:25
two-pronged approach meaning you have two strategies in one on page and off page and so off page involves
4:14:33
backlinking so backlinks are just links that direct users from other websites to
4:14:39
your own website so with that inherently it's going to drive traffic qualify
4:14:44
traffic to your website because if somebody's on a relevant website that's linking to yours and they click on that
4:14:50
link and go to your website it's likely going to be qualified meaning they're going to be relevant and so back linking
4:14:56
because it's an off-page strategy why isn't an off-page SEO strategy because if Google crawls that other site that
4:15:04
has a link to you then that's going to give you credit because Google say hey this site's getting some links from some
4:15:10
relevant sites we must think they're relevant and therefore we're going to trust the site so by Google trusting
4:15:18
your site it's going to improve your organic ranking and with the organic rankings being approved meaning it's
4:15:26
going to mean faster indexing so what does that mean so you want to be indexed by the search engines and so the quicker
4:15:33
Google can find your pages even if it's on somebody else's site then that means they're going to follow that link go to
4:15:40
that page on your site and take that page back to their servers to be indexed okay so the quicker you can get index
4:15:46
the quicker you can get found and then it helps with referral traffic so again we noticed that our efforts are on SEO
4:15:53
organic search but if you're getting traffic from another website hey that still counts that's referral traffic
4:15:59
okay so that's a side advantage to having backlinks is good traffic from
4:16:05
other sites okay so those those are inherently the some of the reasons to to do backlinking okay never hurts I mean
4:16:12
there's brand awareness reasons to being on other sites as well there's industry leadership meaning if you you post
4:16:19
content on Reddit okay you're coming across as an industry leader but yet generating a backlink which helps with
4:16:25
SEO and referral traffic so there's a lot of benefits to building backlinks and the opposite of backlinks are
4:16:32
internal links so you want to do internal linking and that just means connecting one page on your site to
4:16:38
another and why is that beneficial because it can help direct visitors to other Pages they wouldn't normally
4:16:45
otherwise find via your navigation so if you're active on a Blog don't be afraid
4:16:52
to include multiple internal links you want to move people through your site you want the flow of traffic to go from
4:16:59
one page to another to another and so when you do internal linking just like with backlinks it's going to improve the
4:17:06
indexing of your website Google's going to follow those links and index those pages and Google does give credit from
4:17:13
an SEO perspective from an internal linking perspective so if one page is
4:17:18
linked to another and that page has really good relevance in the eyes of Google then the other page is probably
4:17:23
going to benefit from that the other reason we want to do internal linking again you want to move people from your
4:17:28
one page of your site to the other and when you do that it's going to reduce bounce rates so bounce rate is simply
4:17:34
the rate at which people land on a page and then leave so if I have a hundred people in on my home page and only one
4:17:41
person went to another page and the other 99 left the site then that's a 99
4:17:47
bounce rate so by putting internal links in place you're helping people move from
4:17:53
one page to the other and thus reducing the bounce rate and that's what you want you want to keep people on your site you
4:18:00
want to be greedy it also drives traffic to older posts so again when we say
4:18:05
older post we're really referring to blog posts so if you have a relevant blog post and you're writing a new blog
4:18:12
post then link the two together if it's relevant link it I don't you know regardless of how old it is you know you
4:18:18
want to show Google that these older blog posts just because they were written a year ago doesn't mean they're outdated and old-fashioned okay or
4:18:25
useless you want to keep them alive by linking to them so to me that's a good strategy for internal linking link to
4:18:33
older blog posts you know show people you're an industry expert you've been doing this for a while and then you have
4:18:38
lots of content to share okay so the longer you can keep somebody on your website the more likely it is they're
4:18:45
going to engage and convert and some other inherent benefits improves pagerank so what we mean by Page rank is
4:18:52
simply just a rank that Google gives pages so the more internal linking you have the better off you are and then it
4:18:58
helps spread link juice across websites and what I mean by link juice again just like backlinking it builds relevancy so
4:19:05
just keep all these inherent benefits in mind to internal linking the end result is keeping the flow of traffic on your
4:19:13
site and all these other benefits will fall into place okay so another way in
4:19:18
which you can really hone in on traffic to your website is long tail keywords and long tail keywords to me are more
4:19:26
than just one or two keyword phrases okay so there are usually three or
4:19:31
longer keywords in a phrase okay so long tail keywords really nowadays account
4:19:37
for most web searches people really take the time to even post questions as a
4:19:43
search query they likely somebody it's unlikely somebody's going to go into search and just type in the word shoes
4:19:48
they might type in red shoes but that's unlikely what they're probably going to type in is you know red Nike running
4:19:57
shoes 2019 or some variation of that okay that's a long tail keyword and some
4:20:04
of the advantages of using long tail keywords to be found for are less competition so if you you're using broad
4:20:10
keywords like red shoes then who doesn't want to be found for Red Shoes well you don't necessarily you don't want to be
4:20:17
found for red shoes because it's too broad you don't know what type of shoes somebody's looking for you just know
4:20:22
they're looking for Red Shoes it could be running shoes it could be work shoes it could be you know boots it could be
4:20:29
slippers okay it's too bright so long tail keywords help narrow it in and the
4:20:34
more narrow and focused a keyword is the less competition is going to have and when something's not competitive in the
4:20:41
form of a keyword then that means your chances of ranking for that keyword are going to be greater and the chance of
4:20:47
you ranking faster are going to be greater and then of course if somebody's looking for exactly what you have to offer then you have a higher chance to
4:20:54
convert that person so if you have exactly those 2019 red Nike women's
4:20:59
running shoes and somebody does a search for that and that's a long tail keyword and they click on your organic listing
4:21:05
if you have the right price then they're probably going to convert so you have a really good chance of converting
4:21:11
somebody using long tail keywords so my point here is if you're looking for keywords to use focus on longer tail
4:21:17
don't focus on one or two keyword phrases what it also does is it brings targeted traffic so even if somebody
4:21:24
doesn't convert hey they could be back because it's exactly what they're looking for and if you're focusing on
4:21:31
longer tail keywords like I just mentioned stay away from the shorter ones it's just easier to optimize your
4:21:37
page for SEO so remember SEO is a two-pronged approach on page and off
4:21:42
page we talked about off page with internal linking and backlinks on page is all about making sure there's
4:21:49
keywords you choose are integrated in with the page you want to be found for and so if you're using a long tail
4:21:55
keyword it's just easy to work that keyword in so it enables easier on-page
4:22:01
optimization okay let's switch away from SEO to email marketing so let's focus on
4:22:07
email marketing as a form or method of driving traffic to your website so email
4:22:13
marketing has been around a long time in terms of digital marketing why because it provides an effective way to convert
4:22:20
leads into sales why because you can send personalized emails to a target audience so when you send an email to
4:22:27
somebody on a regular basis you know who that person is so what are you doing in the email you're writing a specific
4:22:34
message to that person well email marketing is the same thing except you're just sending an email to a larger
4:22:40
group of people and when you send an email to a larger group of people you're still going to personalize the message
4:22:47
right you're not going to send a generic email to 1 000 people okay nobody's
4:22:53
gonna do that so make sure your email is targeted if it's targeted it could be cost effective why because sending large
4:23:00
amounts of emails or let's just say an email to a large amount of people or a
4:23:05
large group of people is going to be cost effective it's not cost per click you know it's not cost per open okay so
4:23:12
email usually depending on the the email provider you're using really is a flat
4:23:18
fee so just really depends on how many emails you're sending or how how many people you're sending the email to as
4:23:25
well so but email generally tends to be more cost effective than other forms of marketing so look at the email content
4:23:33
provider you're using and just get a sense of what they charge but if you look at it and do a comparison email
4:23:39
generally is cheaper than say doing pay-per-click because with pay-per-click you're paying for each click okay so
4:23:45
that could be expensive depending on the keywords so email marketing is also time saving okay meaning it's a one-time
4:23:52
thing and done so once you send the email it's just a matter of you know watching and looking at the metrics and
4:23:59
learning what's going on so you don't make the same mistakes again but it is time conducive meaning you send out one
4:24:06
email and that's it with pay-per-click you're constantly a measuring and managing the campaigns and it provides
4:24:13
real-time marketing so when you do send the email more than likely a majority of the people on day one or the day you
4:24:19
send the email are going to be able to view it open it click on some of the links and convert so that's normally
4:24:27
what happens in email majority of the people open it on day one and it kind of tails off from there so think about it
4:24:33
as real time so when you send that email and if you have a thousand people on your email recipient list break it up
4:24:39
send the first 500 first with a different subject line and then you can see the data come in and if you don't
4:24:47
see the good results from the subject line or the body of the email or you
4:24:52
know the page they're going to then make adjustments before you send the other email to the next 500. so that's a great
4:24:58
thing about emails you can break up the email into two groups the first group and then the second group with different
4:25:04
subject lines and you can probably send them a little bit of time apart that way you can learn learn from the first email
4:25:10
because with email you are generally going to get results right away okay
4:25:15
within the first 24 hours so that's a great thing about email okay so the other thing about email it's less
4:25:22
intrusive so normally people who are going to get the email are the ones who
4:25:27
sign up for the email so they're almost expecting your email so when they get your email again as long as you're not
4:25:34
sending an email on a daily basis normally most companies send it monthly or bi-weekly it's not going to be as
4:25:40
intrusive okay and then it also helps build credibility increase visibility and brand awareness meaning you're going
4:25:46
to build your brand in that email you're going to put content in that email that's going to show off your
4:25:54
credibility meaning you could put some testimonials in the email you can put some good affiliations you can put a
4:25:59
good article to an industry article you just wrote so email is going to inherently continue to build brand
4:26:06
awareness for you okay and it's an easy way to track our Roi so if your e-commerce it's pretty clear you send
4:26:13
the email somebody opens it clicks on it checks out and purchases something it's
4:26:18
easily trackable because you could track it right from that email so one thing I want to say there is just if you do send
4:26:24
an email make sure you're tracking that campaign and you want to be able to use an analytics program like Google
4:26:31
analytics okay if you use Google analytics you're going to be able to track when you send the email who clicks
4:26:37
on it and who converts so you want to be able to measure an Roi for these emails and you can and that's the beauty of
4:26:44
email marketing okay let's move away from email marketing to webinars so webinars great method for Effective
4:26:51
social media promotion it's a great way to bring traffic to your website so why
4:26:57
do we recommend webinars well because it provides direct content contact within
4:27:02
your target group what I mean by contact with your target group well you're going to host a webinar and you're going to
4:27:09
invite this targeted group of people who are interested in your product or service so if you have a Facebook
4:27:15
Community you can do a Facebook live event or you could do a YouTube or you
4:27:20
know you can even set up a webinar and another platform but promote it on social media and if you're pronouning
4:27:27
something on social media you're probably promoting it to people who are already following you or like you and so
4:27:32
that's what we mean by direct contact with your target groups you're you're going to be able to create a webinar and
4:27:39
talk directly to that group and that's going to help build brand awareness and credibility and the great thing about
4:27:45
webinars is you don't need some fancy software I mean I'm talking to you on a webinar right now and so webinars are
4:27:52
free all you need is a video camera and a recorder that's all and that's all
4:27:58
built in with software so there's plenty of software out there that allows you just to do a webinar really quick and
4:28:04
easy there's lots of opportunities in software so and a lot of them are very costly effective so if you want to build
4:28:11
create a webinar you can do that by spending very little money in webinars
4:28:16
again allow you to talk to your your targeted group your community maybe prospective clients it helps build
4:28:23
credibility and in effect Drive traffic to your website and when somebody does attend a webinar they're likely going to
4:28:30
be highly engaged because you're inviting them they're going to opt into the webinar and the great thing about
4:28:36
webinars is even if they don't attend the webinar the day you have it it's going to be recorded so they can always
4:28:42
go back and watch it so whoever watches the webinar is going to be engaged because it's going to be a topic they're
4:28:48
interested in and then users are likely to become prospective customers so having a webinar talking about something
4:28:55
inherently interesting to maybe a larger group of people you can promote that on
4:29:01
social media and potentially get prospective customers to sign up and watch the webinar and if you do they're
4:29:08
going to be engaged and then take the next step oh I like what this guy this person has to say they seem to be
4:29:15
credible I like their personality I like their brand I like their product I'm gonna go check their web out their
4:29:21
website okay so webinars allow you to kind of pull in more people as well as just your community because you can
4:29:28
promote the webinar and you can promote it in advance and you can leverage social media for that okay so something
4:29:34
related to webinars incorporating video content so videos have been proven to be
4:29:41
a really good way to attract new visitors and it just it makes your website very engaging when you have
4:29:47
videos on your website as well so if you create video you have an opportunity to
4:29:53
post it on various video platforms like YouTube or Vimeo okay there's plenty of
4:29:58
video platforms out there or just embedded in a blog post or embed it in a
4:30:04
Facebook post or a tweet okay so you can do a lot with video and having video on
4:30:10
your site is going to increase engagement okay when you increase engagement good things happen that's
4:30:16
going to lead to increased conversions and sales or or Roi or just like we
4:30:22
mentioned the webinar can help build trust with your audience so even that webinar you could post on your website
4:30:28
so you want people to engage by watching this video they watch the video they're going to gain trust in you because
4:30:34
you're talking directly to that person that user that audience that visitor to your website and when you get Bell trust
4:30:41
it's going to increase engagement and that's the beauty of video unlike text
4:30:46
or imagery videos really do engage with the audience and so the more video you
4:30:52
could do the better off you are because again you can leverage social to draw attention to your brand and product and
4:30:59
service and then you can have that video on your website to increase engagement which in turn increases conversions and
4:31:06
sales and improves Roi so always they think video there's plenty of video software out there that you can leverage
4:31:12
and the great thing about video two is hey most people are using mobile phones these days smartphones and so video
4:31:20
works just as well on mobile as it does on desktop so keep that in mind you know
4:31:25
video is going to be engaging regardless of what device somebody uses and then of
4:31:30
course if they're watching the video on Facebook or YouTube then it's chances are they're going to share that
4:31:38
particular video which is going to bode well for your brand and traffic okay so video if somebody likes a video it's
4:31:45
very easy to share video especially from a mobile phone so YouTube just makes it so easy to share or like or subscribe to
4:31:53
a channel it just it becomes that much easier things can go viral and chances
4:31:59
of them going viral with video are going to be greater okay so other ways to drive traffic to your website is submit
4:32:05
your content to content aggregators so what's a Content aggregate Gator well content aggregators like Reddit that
4:32:12
provides a great platform for you to post your content so that's what a Content aggregator is really a site like
4:32:17
Reddit or medium or quora where you could post content to a large number of people okay so with Reddit people are
4:32:25
either going to upvote it or download it so the more upvotes you get are thumbs
4:32:30
up or likes or people who encourage that content the more of a chance it has to
4:32:37
be found and so first thing out of the gate if you do provide content to a Content aggregator like Reddit make sure
4:32:43
it's good quality content that's interesting and that should be a case the case around across the board whether it's a social post or blog post make
4:32:51
sure the content's unique professional and interesting and then if you do say put something on medium or you do put
4:32:58
something on quora and it is professional and interesting and thought provoking then people are going to react
4:33:05
to it and then that again could lead to traffic but even if it does doesn't lead to traffic it helps build brand
4:33:11
awareness so if you have content just like videos leverage it put the content out there okay and when you put content
4:33:17
out there it's only gonna especially if it's good content put it's going to put you in a good light so don't be afraid
4:33:24
to share your content on the likes of Reddit or medium or core or some of
4:33:29
these other content aggregator websites because good things are only going to happen and again referral traffic SEO
4:33:37
brand awareness conversions so all these are inherent benefits of just sharing
4:33:43
your content okay and then finally we want to learn from analytics okay so what do I mean learning from analytics
4:33:49
so there are plenty of analytics platforms out there one of the most popular is Google analytics so you want
4:33:56
to make sure you're tracking traffic on your site with Google analytics so I have to do is just go to Google
4:34:01
analytics via search sign up add the analytics code to your website and voila
4:34:06
they're doing all the heavy lifting they're going to to track traffic coming your website and not only they're going
4:34:12
to track traffic but they're going to tell you how that traffic engaged and so the benefits of it Google analytics is
4:34:19
hey you could figure out where users are coming from are they coming from that email campaign that I sent out to a
4:34:25
thousand people are they coming from YouTube based on that video I posted or are they coming from Reddit based on the
4:34:31
content I just posted there or they come in from organic search it is so Google
4:34:36
analytics can help us understand how much traffic we're getting from organic search so it'll help us measure our SEO
4:34:44
efforts and then with Google analytics you could segment so we could segment by mobile we can segment by desktop
4:34:50
returning user new user by campaign by Page by Language by city by region I
4:34:58
mean there's so many ways in which to segment your audience and segmenting simply is breaking up the entire group
4:35:05
of people who come to your website into different segments based on on what you want to say so if you want to look at
4:35:12
you know females between the ages of 18 to 24 who come from mobile via organic
4:35:18
search that's a segment and you can look at that information and analytics if
4:35:24
that's your target audience then you could see how they're performing okay so Anna there are a lot of benefits to
4:35:29
Google analytics definitely wants to take advantage of segmenting in Google
4:35:34
analytics you could look at your competition so there's a benchmarking report the great thing about Google
4:35:40
analytics you can also look at content and how your content is performing once
4:35:45
somebody lands on your website are they what page are they spending time on what page are they engaging on the most okay
4:35:52
what pages have the highest bounce rate or the lowest time on page so you can really determine what pages work best
4:35:58
and then of course the end result in analyzing all this data is you want to
4:36:03
be able to fine-tune your website so take advantage of the data that Google analytics or or any other analytics
4:36:10
platform has given you by learning once you learn what's going on with your website you can make adjustments to your
4:36:17
website to improve user experience okay so we went over a lot of different ways
4:36:24
to drive traffic okay you can incorporate all this to your website immediately
4:36:30
let's talk about that keyword research for a website with shoes and it doesn't
4:36:36
really matter what particular product you have if you need to rank number one
4:36:42
on Google it all starts with the keywords as I mentioned before and so in
4:36:47
this example if you have a website where you sell shoes for kids you're going to want to be found for certain keywords so
4:36:54
the obvious keyword here would be shoes for kids well every keyword that you
4:37:00
target has search volume associated with it so that means when we talk about
4:37:05
search volume we're talking about how many people on average type in that
4:37:11
keyword or related keyword on google.com or Google search and there's always an
4:37:17
average number of searches associated with every keyword and we call that search volume how much search volume so
4:37:24
obviously if we're going to Target a keyword we want to have as much volume as possible however there's always going
4:37:31
to be competition for those keywords meaning there's always going to be other websites who want to rank number one on
4:37:37
Google for the same keywords and we call that competition or difficulty so for
4:37:43
every keyword you're going to have volume and you're going to have competition or difficulty and the difficulty ranges as well depending on
4:37:51
the tool you use and we'll get into that in a minute but search volume is how
4:37:57
much on average people are typing in that keyword or close variance of that keyword and the difficulty is measured
4:38:04
in terms of how many other websites are trying to rank for the same keyword and
4:38:10
so ideally when it comes to keyword research we want to find that nice balance we want high volume and we want
4:38:18
low competition but at the same time we want to focus on keywords that are highly relevant to our business so if
4:38:25
we're selling shoes for kids and shoes for kids is highly relevant has high
4:38:30
volume in low competition then that's a keyword we want to Target so we always want to focus in on those three areas so
4:38:38
there's always a trade-off with keywords so shoes for kids might have high volume but also might have high competition or
4:38:46
difficulty if we look for another keyword that's just as relevant for example shoes for children it may still
4:38:53
have high search volume but the competition or the difficulty may be lower and if that's the case then that
4:39:00
may be a better keyword for us to Target instead of something highly competitive
4:39:05
like shoes for kids we can focus on another relevant keyword like shoes for
4:39:10
children with just as much volume and lower competition and the reason why we
4:39:16
want lower competition is because we want to be able to rank for that keyword so the higher the competition the harder
4:39:23
it is for us to rank number one on Google for that keyword and so the whole
4:39:28
idea be on keyword research is analyz amazing and choosing the best keywords so we want to identify a list of
4:39:34
keywords that are always relevant we want to choose the keyword that your competitors are ranking for and we want
4:39:40
to use third-party tools to choose keywords to identify which keywords have
4:39:46
low competition and what keywords have high search volume so one thing to take
4:39:51
into consideration when you're doing keyword research is that the longer the key word phrase or in other words long
4:39:58
tail keywords or keywords with three keywords in the phrase or more you're going to always have less competition
4:40:06
but there's always a trade-off with long tail keywords meaning the longer the keyword phrase there's going to be less
4:40:13
volume but the trade-off is less competition and so what we want to do is we want to brainstorm some ideas and
4:40:20
find those relevant keywords so let's look at an example here so if we go to
4:40:25
Google ads so Google ads has a total Keyword Planner and let's just say I
4:40:31
have a a website where I'm selling dried figs and if I'm selling dried figs I
4:40:38
want people to buy these dried figs however in order to attract them I want to be able to show them that hey we have
4:40:45
a bunch of recipes and if I show you a bunch of recipes where you can use dried
4:40:50
figs maybe you'll buy these dried figs to use in these recipes and so we're
4:40:55
going to look for keywords related to bread recipes because if we can optimize
4:41:01
for our recipes page for bread then that will attract an audience who wants to
4:41:06
make bread and use dried figs with those bread recipes so that's the example I'm going to give here and so if I look at
4:41:14
the Keyword Planner and Google ads if I just type in bread recipes what Google is going to do is they're going to give
4:41:21
me an average monthly search volume so I can see the average monthly search volume here is 60 500. and so in order
4:41:30
to keep word research what I would recommend is keep a spreadsheet and so the idea behind the spreadsheet is to
4:41:37
document the volume and the competition you're getting for certain keywords so if I go into a spreadsheet here my theme
4:41:45
of keywords is bread recipes my keyword is bread recipes and my volume therefore
4:41:51
is going to be sixty thousand five hundred however if I go back into Google's Keyword Planner Google's
4:41:58
telling me the competition is low so that's great I want high volume I want
4:42:03
low competition but how low is low so we want to be careful so if we're going to
4:42:10
put in numbers into a spreadsheet we want to figure out what that competition really is for the keyword bread recipes
4:42:16
so if I go to Google and just type in bread recipes I'm going to be able to see
4:42:22
771 billion results for the keyword bread recipes now with 771 billion are
4:42:30
real competition maybe maybe not what we want to do is put in a syntax and we
4:42:36
want to put in the syntax all in title and then colon space and then our keyword and the reason why we do that in
4:42:43
search is because we want to be able to identify the true competitive number or
4:42:48
the true number of websites or trying to rank for bread recipes and if we put in
4:42:54
the syntax all entitled colon and then our keyword bread recipes we'll be able
4:42:59
to see that there are 998 000 results that's a lot lower than 771
4:43:07
billion so that means that 998 000 sites or listings have the keyword
4:43:14
bread recipes in the title tag and the title tag is what shows up in the search
4:43:20
engine results and so if I look down and scroll down here I can see bread recipes on every one of these title tags so
4:43:29
title tag is an important element to rank number one on Google and we'll talk
4:43:34
about that in a few minutes but if we understand that there are 998 000
4:43:40
results with bread recipes in the title tag then this tells us that those are the websites who are trying to rank
4:43:47
number one on Google for that keyword and therefore those are the websites we need to jump over in order for our
4:43:54
website to rank number one on Google and so therefore I'm going to put in 998
4:43:59
000 in my spreadsheet as the competitive number and so now I could see for the
4:44:04
keyword bread recipes I have 60 500 and if my competition is 998 000 then my Kei
4:44:14
or keyword Effectiveness index or in other words the ratio of volume to
4:44:19
competition is six percent so that's nothing more than volume divided by
4:44:25
competition so that tells me that my Kei or my ratio which between volume
4:44:31
competition is six percent so remember we want more volume than we want
4:44:36
competition so anytime you do a keyword research you're going to find a number of different relevant keywords so if I
4:44:43
go back into Google's Keyword Planner if I typed in bread recipes you could see
4:44:49
that Google is going to give me a number of different keywords related to bread
4:44:54
recipes let's just say I have another keyword that I want to think about optimizing for being ranked on Google
4:45:01
for and that's banana bread recipe very similar keyword as bread recipes except
4:45:07
it's a little longer tail now if I type in banana bread recipe and Google's
4:45:12
Keyword Planner now I can see the average monthly search volume has actually gone up it's 368
4:45:18
000. I can also see the competition is low so those are good signs so now I can
4:45:24
see 368 000 I'm going to go ahead and put that in my spreadsheet now I'm gonna go into
4:45:30
to Google I'm going to put in my syntax all in title I'm going to put in banana bread recipe I'm going to hit enter and
4:45:37
now I can see I have 233 000 results with the keyword banana
4:45:44
bread recipe in the title tag so if I look at the title tags I can see banana
4:45:49
bread recipe banana bread recipe banana bread recipe on all the listings in the
4:45:55
Google search results so that tells me I have 233 000 results that I have to jump over in
4:46:02
order to rank number one on Google so I'm going to put 233 000 in my spreadsheet now I can see my
4:46:10
Kei or my volume to competition ratio is 157 158 and so to me that's a lot better
4:46:19
number to work with or in other words that's a lot better keyword because it's
4:46:25
just as relevant and it has a higher ratio of volume to competition so
4:46:31
therefore banana bread recipe is going to be a better keyword to optimize for
4:46:37
in order to rank number one on Google so that's the whole idea behind keyword
4:46:42
research you want to brainstorm ideas there are plenty of tools out there so
4:46:47
the tool I recommend is Google ads Keyword Planner Google's going to give
4:46:52
you how much search volume they're going to tell you the competition but then you're going to go into Google search
4:46:58
you're going to use the syntax on title to get a more accurate read on the
4:47:03
actual competitive number and so to find out how keywords that your competitors are ranking for you can use those
4:47:11
keyword tools that I mentioned another tool that I use is Miles so Moz if you
4:47:16
go to moz.com they have a tool called keyword Explorer so if we just type in
4:47:22
the keyword for example bread recipes it's going to be able to tell us how
4:47:28
much volume and the difficulty so you can use other tools at your disposal
4:47:33
figure out the volume and the difficulty there are plenty of tools out there but the one thing I would just make sure is
4:47:41
you use everything at your disposal so you can use social media to find the
4:47:46
most shared article for a particular topic or keyword like bread recipes you can check other platforms that have a
4:47:53
lot of shared content like Reddit and quora where you can ask people about certain topics using keywords to figure
4:48:00
out how much competition or volume there might be you could stay up to date on industry news to get an idea of what
4:48:08
types of keywords are trending but when it comes to keywords and keyword research remember for every web page we
4:48:16
want to be able to pick two keywords we want a primary and secondary keyword so
4:48:21
when we do keyword research and we enter all our keywords into our spreadsheet we
4:48:27
want to be able to have a number of different keywords in this case we're focusing on the theme bread recipes we
4:48:34
want to have different keywords because we want to be able to choose a primary keyword and a secondary keyword because
4:48:41
we want to be able to focus on multiple keywords for each page because we don't want to put necessarily all our eggs in
4:48:48
one basket meaning we won't want to put all our emphasis just on one keyword to rank for we want multiple keywords to
4:48:56
try and rank for so the primary keyword can Define the nature of our business the secondary keyword could be just
4:49:03
highly relevant to our keyword at the end of the day we want to choose multiple keywords to try and rank on
4:49:10
Google for that page so for example we have a Blog and we're using ice cream
4:49:16
recipes and we're blogging about ice cream recipes we can have the primary keyword that is about ice cream recipes
4:49:23
or homemade ice cream recipes we're going to always want to find out what the volume and the competition is our
4:49:29
sec secondary keyword could be built around other similar keywords like
4:49:35
low-fat ice cream recipes or fat free ice cream recipes or low-fat homemade
4:49:40
ice cream recipes those are complementary keywords just like our bread recipes and banana bread recipe so
4:49:48
one thing we want to do when we do keyword research is we want to be able
4:49:53
to Target one keyword per content when you can Target many we want to be able
4:49:59
to Target multiple keywords not necessarily Target one keyword and so we
4:50:04
want to be able to Cluster keywords so we don't want to Target just one we want to Target multiple keywords per page and
4:50:12
when we talk about clustering if we go back to our keyword research what we're
4:50:17
doing is we're clustering a bunch of keywords under the theme bread recipes and so by looking at the volume looking
4:50:24
at the competition looking at the Kei we can choose different keywords for our
4:50:30
page and that's what we mean by clustering we want to Cluster keywords into a Content frame so why Target only
4:50:36
one keyword per content when we can Target many because we don't want to put all our eggs in one basket we don't want
4:50:43
to Target just one keyword we want to Target many and so that means clustering your keywords into a theme and choosing
4:50:50
multiple keywords for that particular page and when we do that we have a
4:50:56
better opportunity to rank high on Google Search and the whole idea behind
4:51:02
ranking high on Google Search is we can get the volume so if we know we're ranked number one on Google search for
4:51:08
bread recipes or banana bread recipe we know we stand a chance of getting a
4:51:14
majority of the volume associated with that keyword and if we can get the
4:51:20
volume and get the traffic then we can get the conversions so let's move on to
4:51:26
high quality content and talk about the impact content it has on your ability to
4:51:33
get your website ranked number one on Google so let's just say you have
4:51:38
content on your website and the content is ranking on you know page four of
4:51:44
Google and it's that blog with ice cream recipes and if it's just content for the
4:51:50
sake of content it's not really informative then it's not necessarily going to get good engagement in the eyes
4:51:57
of Google you know they want to rank content that's very informative it's very fresh it's exciting to read it's
4:52:03
interesting it's going to have good engagement so if it's a recipe or an
4:52:09
article about any topic if it's the content is just non-informative then
4:52:14
you're not going to get good engagement and when you don't get good engagement if people don't stay on the site to
4:52:20
engage in the content and they just leave the website after landing on the page causing a bounce then the content
4:52:28
is just going to continue to fall down on the rankings and we want to prevent that we want to move up the rankings we
4:52:33
want to be number one on Google we don't necessarily want to fall in the rankings
4:52:39
for our content so content is a key driver and being able to rank number one
4:52:44
on Google so if the content is on page nine what can we do well we want to be
4:52:51
able to you know take that content and do something with it we feel like we did write engaging content so let's go ahead
4:52:58
and share it on social media and to me social media is a good platform to share
4:53:03
your content because on social media platforms like Facebook for example you're building a community on that
4:53:10
platform that Community is already interested in your content so if you're sharing an ice cream recipe especially
4:53:16
in the summertime and you're engaging with your community on that platform then the likelihood of that community on
4:53:24
that platform is going to increase engagement increased engagement will
4:53:29
send social signals to the search engine that says hey this content is good
4:53:35
quality likewise for any other platform most social media platforms have engagement metrics and those engagement
4:53:42
metrics pass signals is it good is it not good do we like this content are we
4:53:48
giving it a thumbs up are we going to want to follow it are we going to want to share it and so if you share content
4:53:54
that you feel is engaging on social platforms then it's going to be engaging and it's likely going to cause an
4:54:02
increase in engagement for example a decrease in balance and once you share
4:54:07
that quality content then the likelihood of it moving up the rankings even as far
4:54:13
as number one on Google is going to be greater so you always want to start out writing good quality content so let's
4:54:20
talk about good quality content because Google does take content seriously they
4:54:26
do take into account what other people think of that content so high quality content is an important factor so how to
4:54:33
create good content that's always the question so let's talk about some best practices here remember in the last
4:54:40
segment we talked about keyword research so we want to perform good keyword research why because we want to choose
4:54:47
keywords remember we're choosing multiple keywords per page one keyword could be related to our brand one
4:54:55
keyword could be related to the content but another keyword could be related to a user's intent like recipes if you
4:55:02
recall the example we use with bread recipes maybe somebody's looking to type in a keyword that says how do I make you
4:55:09
know a bread or how do I make a specific type of bread or how do I make banana bread or what's the best recipe for
4:55:16
banana bread they're question related and we want to be able to answer those questions so that's where choosing those
4:55:23
right keywords that's going to respond to a user's intent so starts with
4:55:28
choosing the right keywords so remember we talked about a number of different tools when we talked about keyword
4:55:34
research so there's a research tool that you can use called phrase.io and that
4:55:41
will help you do quick research on you know keywords and Trends and whatnot so
4:55:46
if you know a better research tool that you use for keyword research then drop us a comment below I'd be interested in
4:55:53
getting your comments about keyword research and what research tools are out there so if you know something better
4:55:59
than phrase.io drop a comment below and we'd be interested in getting your perspective so keyword research is key
4:56:07
but creating content that fulfills users requirements so answering those questions it's a recipe we want to
4:56:14
answer that question if it's directions we want to answer that question if they don't know how to do something we want
4:56:19
to answer that question then that's the whole idea behind content content is not just a fill a page it's to really
4:56:26
fulfill users requirements that's when you get good engage engagement so if somebody's typing in something on Google
4:56:32
and they're looking for an answer your content should answer that question but we also want to make the content
4:56:38
readable so in other words you know write for your audience don't impress
4:56:43
anybody with very high vocabulary type words that somebody doesn't necessarily
4:56:49
know the meaning of don't use jargon don't use a street language for example
4:56:55
use everyday common language that's just easily digestible when your audience is
4:57:01
reading and then we want to keep that content organized and so when we mean organized we want to use headers and
4:57:07
subheaders you know break your content into paragraphs keep the flow organized if we can keep the flow organized then
4:57:14
it's going to be easier for somebody to read and then it's okay to add resources especially resources from credible sites
4:57:21
so if you can incorporate those resources in there then it's just going to add The credibility to your content
4:57:28
let the audience know that hey I I've done my research on this topic and this is what this person has to say about it
4:57:34
this person who seems to be credible okay so it only adds value to your content so these are all tips to
4:57:40
Remember When creating content and then the one important tip here is we want to
4:57:46
use white hat techniques and when we say white hat techniques that means you know if we've chosen keywords that are going
4:57:53
to answer somebody's question we don't want to stuff those keywords into the content we want the content to be
4:57:59
naturally written so when we say opt for wide hack techniques that's what we mean write the content naturally keep it
4:58:06
organized keep it readable include third-party sources and make sure it
4:58:11
answers a question so there are different types of content so there's content where you just write words to
4:58:18
install text based you could also use an infographic infographic is simply just a
4:58:24
graphic that visualizes exactly what you're trying to explain for example if
4:58:29
we want to write an article about how to write good engaging content we don't
4:58:36
necessarily have to write all that out as a text we can create an infographic so for example here's an infographic on
4:58:43
20 effective ways to basically not bore your readers but write engaging content
4:58:50
so you could see this is an infographic it's all graphically laid out so infographics tend to be easier to
4:58:58
understand because they're visual they're easy for the end user to comprehend because there's generally no
4:59:04
jargon it's usually images that are portraying the points of what you're trying to get across and so it tends to
4:59:11
break it up the monotony of just text it's more visually appealing and it's
4:59:17
laid out and organized so you can see this infographic has 20 different steps
4:59:22
or rules and they lay those out all here in this infographic and the great thing I like about infographics is you could
4:59:28
you could share them on social media you can re-engage them as a post you can save them from really any social
4:59:34
platform so infographics tend to tell a better story and versus say just writing
4:59:42
text you can use video and images so you don't necessarily have to lay it all out in an infographic you can certainly
4:59:49
insert a video or an image into your content especially if it's a blog post
4:59:55
if it's a blog post then sometimes video and image is on its own tell the story
5:00:01
you don't necessarily need text to go ahead and tell your story a video or an
5:00:09
image as they say tells a thousand words and so images and videos are great to
5:00:16
use in a blog post so using different forms of content you know you always want to review your content when a user
5:00:23
dwells on your web page for a longer time Google will tend to think okay this person's engaged so we're going to rank
5:00:30
that favorable so if you're using infographics videos and images then the
5:00:36
chances of somebody being more engaged are going to increase versus just text that's not well organized and written
5:00:43
out in a way that somebody doesn't necessarily understand so be creative in
5:00:49
the types of content you use so longer engaging content tends to bode well with
5:00:55
search engines so this is according to HubSpot so the more word count you use
5:01:01
the more words you use the chances of you ranking higher are going to be better just take into account best
5:01:08
practices you want to maybe break up the content with an image organize it make
5:01:14
it engaging use headers so it's not necessarily just words it's the words and how those words are written how
5:01:21
they're structured the types of keywords you're using how you're engaging with your audience there's a lot of factors
5:01:27
again there's best practices we just went over but the key is you know if you have longer more engaging content then
5:01:35
it's going to bode better for you on search engines so a couple of steps to
5:01:40
create high quality content so you want to begin with a comprehensive introduction so always introduce your
5:01:47
content remember the content should be relevant to the keywords so if you're choosing keywords and your keyword
5:01:54
research think about answering that question if somebody's typing in bread recipes maybe they're looking for banana
5:02:00
bread recipes how to make the best banana bread or how to make banana bread
5:02:05
using dried figs we want to be able to align our content with that keyword
5:02:11
naturally you want to create a title that's worthy that's click worthy so remember if you're in Google search and
5:02:18
you're doing search for something simple like bread recipes we want to make
5:02:24
something that's going to be you know engaging for somebody to click on like easy perfect yeast spread are easy
5:02:30
crusty French bread or something that's going to be engaging you know the best bread recipes or how to make the best
5:02:36
homemade bread you know something that's going to draw somebody's attention to the title of that blog post so we want
5:02:44
to include LSI keywords so what I mean by LSI keywords in your content we mean
5:02:51
you know long tail keywords make it natural headings and subheadings should
5:02:56
consist of keywords and variants so if you're writing headers and subheaders
5:03:01
include the keyword in there and that way the content always stays relevant to
5:03:07
the audience okay shorten your sentences in paragraphs so don't write long paragraphs remember we want to break
5:03:12
this up we want to make it easier for the end user to read and we want to
5:03:18
always put internal links on our blog post why because if we have internal
5:03:24
links then if we have a link from one blog post to another blog post or say
5:03:30
our blog post to an internal page on our website we want to make sure that it's
5:03:35
relevant content that way somebody's reading something and you have an internal link let's just say from a
5:03:40
bread recipes page to a banana bread recipes page then they may find it
5:03:46
interesting click on that link and go to the banana bread recipes page so it's keeping somebody engaged on your website
5:03:52
so putting in internal linking will help keep the end user engaged because you're
5:04:00
offering up links that's relevant to the content you always want to break up that content with images okay we want to use
5:04:06
alt tags meaning we want to pen the image with text so that way if the image
5:04:13
doesn't load then at least the alt text will load so we can incorporate call out
5:04:19
boxes and more importantly we want to update our content regularly so we
5:04:24
always want to get the best recipe out there if it's banana a bread or
5:04:30
different ways to Crepe banana bread or always just coming up with ways to update the content so we want to keep
5:04:36
our content our blog post fresh and then we want to include a CTA call to action if we include a call to action then
5:04:43
that's going to keep somebody engaged and have them act on your content so
5:04:48
these are steps to creating high quality content and so let's look at an example
5:04:54
here and this is a three-month-old post on BuzzFeed and it's 21 pictures that
5:05:01
restore your faith in humanity so it has a lot of likes a lot of tweaks and that
5:05:06
means it's engaged people are engaged when reading that and so if we go and look at it as an example we could see it
5:05:12
on a buzzfeed here 21 pictures that will restore your faith in humanity so this
5:05:17
was written back in 2012. again a lot of Engagement but if we look at it we can
5:05:25
see immediately that it's taking into account third-party sources it's got some content it's got images it's being
5:05:32
broken up by images we could see there's call to actions on there in the form of
5:05:37
social so people can go ahead and go ahead and share it if they like it okay
5:05:42
it includes videos includes images third-party sources so it's a good post
5:05:49
because says listen you know it's engaging content it's probably answering somebody's question about humanity and
5:05:56
we could see clearly that look you know there's a lot of different examples here from a lot of different sources and we
5:06:02
could take action on this content so not just video not just images but text as
5:06:07
well and so it's very engaging answers questions takes into account the different types of content available so
5:06:14
this is a good post in that regard so contents updated regularly it's engaging
5:06:20
and it includes sources from high Authority websites some do's and don'ts
5:06:25
on the content so take into account the best practices I mentioned about creating high quality content okay
5:06:32
answer those questions that the end user wants to hear you know because that likely is going to be their search and
5:06:39
so you want to be able to respond to the end user that's part of creating high quality content different types of
5:06:46
content I.E in the form of infographic or videos or text or images you can add
5:06:52
images from public domain sites you can be relatable and use examples to clarify
5:06:58
points just like the BuzzFeed article simplify complex words don't use sophisticated language talk to your
5:07:05
audience as if you they were standing right in front of you and use bullet points to exemplify your examples your
5:07:12
points so some Do's the don'ts obviously don't lift content we don't want to lift
5:07:20
content from another website so that's plagiarism so we want to have our own unique content we also don't want to
5:07:26
take images from other websites and so if you do happen to find an image that
5:07:32
works for your post and it's on somebody else's website ideally that's not a good
5:07:37
situation but if you do happen to do that then always give credit to the website okay so if you took it from
5:07:45
xyz.com credit xyz.com for the image and even put a link back but ideally you
5:07:51
don't want to take images from other websites just as much as you don't want to take copy you don't want to take
5:07:58
images use your own imagery and content but if you don't have imagery then you
5:08:03
can always go to stock photography there are plenty of websites out there where you can sign up for a subscription like
5:08:10
Adobe stock images as an example you can sign up for an account and in some cases
5:08:17
you can sign up for a free account and use stock imagery okay don't give less information to your audience give them
5:08:23
to your audience what they deserve which is the information they're looking for they're looking for the best banana
5:08:28
bread recipes give them the best banana bread recipes incorporate your own images break it up with titles give them
5:08:36
a good quality piece of content that they're going to be able to engage with and so if you put long paragraphs in
5:08:44
your content then it's going to be less engaging so try to avoid those long paragraph graphs remember shorten up the
5:08:51
paragraphs keep the language simple add in images answer those questions use
5:08:57
third-party credible sources but write it in your own words and you should be on your way to creating good quality
5:09:04
content okay so now that we've talked about high quality content in order to
5:09:09
get your pages ranked high on Google search let's turn our attention to
5:09:15
optimizing on-page elements and discuss some website level factors that are both
5:09:21
going to help you rank high on Google search so let's just do an overview of what we're talking about when we talk
5:09:27
about on-page elements and website level factors so optimizing on page elements
5:09:33
include a number of different things but primarily we're going to focus in on meta tags also known as meta description
5:09:40
tags header tags also known as title tags and URLs so those are just some of
5:09:46
the on-page elements we want to be able able to optimize using relevant keywords
5:09:53
in order to rank on Google search we also want to take a look at some website
5:09:59
factors that will affect our ranking on Google search they include website
5:10:04
architecture having a secure website having a site map and taking a look at
5:10:09
page speed so all of those are some of the website factors we need to take into
5:10:15
account in order to rank high on Google search so title tag and meta description
5:10:21
together are considered meta tags so both play an important role in ranking
5:10:28
high on Google so we want to be able to write unique title and descriptions for
5:10:33
each page on our website when I say unique that means a title In The Meta description need to be different for
5:10:40
every page on the website and so if you're not quite sure what a title tag in a meta description tag is if you go
5:10:47
to search and just type in any particular our search query the title tag is what's going to show up here and
5:10:53
bold and then the description is going to show up below it below the URL and
5:10:59
that's going to describe the page so both of these meta tags are important
5:11:04
because it describes what your page is all about and that's what Google uses in
5:11:09
the search results pages so we want to be able to pay attention to the length of our meta tags so if we go back to our
5:11:17
search results Pages met title tags are generally 60 65 characters meta
5:11:23
description tags are generally 160 characters so anything really longer
5:11:28
than that then what's going to happen is the meta description tag or the title
5:11:35
tag will get trunk at it and so if we look here for example we could see all
5:11:40
of the title tags here fit the 65 character limit but if you run over the
5:11:47
character count on meta description then Google is going to truncate the copy so
5:11:52
you want to stay within your parameters in order to avoid getting your content truncated and so the other thing when
5:12:00
we're writing title meta description tags we want to minimize keyword repetition so if we're optimizing for
5:12:06
keyword we don't want to necessarily just plug that keyword into the title tag and meta description multiple times
5:12:13
we want to make sure our title tags and meta descriptions are naturally written
5:12:18
so if somebody's typing for banana bread recipe with dried figs you know we want to have a nice title tag and a
5:12:26
description that is going to get somebody to respond based on their need
5:12:31
and so we definitely want to avoid keyword repetition but we want to be able to use that keyword in the title
5:12:38
tag because if you remember from the earlier segment when we did the all in title syntax to find out exactly how
5:12:45
many competitors were using that particular keyword well we obviously want to use that keyword in the title
5:12:51
tag because again the title tag is an important factor when it comes to search engine results so we want to use the
5:12:58
keyword but we want to avoid stuffing or using it repetitively in our title tag
5:13:04
and our meta description we want the title tag and The Meta description to describe the page sound natural but also
5:13:11
be engaging because the point is we want people to click on our link and go to
5:13:16
our website from search engines so title tags with numbers tend to result in
5:13:23
higher click-through rates this is according to mods so for example if you just put in a title tag that says learn
5:13:29
digital marketing well that may work but if you put a number in there like five
5:13:35
easy ways to learn digital marketing that might get somebody to click on your
5:13:40
link and go to your website so having questions in your meta tags can also increase your click-through rate for
5:13:46
example if you just put learn the importance of first page rankings not too bad but again generic but if you put
5:13:54
it into the formal question how to rank number one on Google it's more action oriented it's gonna get somebody to
5:14:01
resonate with the question that they have and that may be their query how to rank number one on Google and so these
5:14:08
techniques will help you get higher click-through rates and so according to
5:14:13
backlinko title tag with a keyword can improve site ranking so remember we want
5:14:19
to include that keyword in the title tag even though we only have 65 characters we want to include that keyword but we
5:14:26
want to avoid stuffing the keyword in there we want to again make the title tag action oriented maybe with the
5:14:34
number maybe as a question with the keyword in there once naturally not easy
5:14:39
to do but that's the beauty of SEO if you can follow these best practices and
5:14:45
write a good title tag then the chances of you you improving in your search
5:14:51
results are going to be greater so having only one H1 tag in your post is
5:14:57
going to be good so remember when somebody clicks on a link so let's say
5:15:02
they do find a title tag engaging and they click on this this link here and
5:15:07
they go to that website you know you want to start out with having that particular H1 Tech because the H1 tag
5:15:15
especially with the keyword in it is going to signal to Google hey we're organizing our page and because it's an
5:15:22
H1 tag it's important we're structuring the page according to best practices so
5:15:28
having only one H1 tag in your post is definitely helpful having multiple tags
5:15:33
H tags in your post help organize the page a lot better so we want to add that
5:15:38
targeted keyword in that tag and your pattern tag should be relevant to the content so if we go back to our example
5:15:45
of the using Drive figs with banana breads why well the title says California fig banana bread and remember
5:15:52
the last segment when we're talking about high quality content well look no further than including a video into our
5:16:01
content so not only will this video help keep the engagement high but it breaks up the monotony of the page and it's
5:16:08
from a third-party source so it adds credibility to the page so adding a video based on the last segment of high
5:16:15
quality content definitely helps with ranking high on Google search so
5:16:20
following hierarchical structure that means putting those H tags in there H2
5:16:26
tags help break up the content and we want to avoid repetition of H1 tags on
5:16:32
your different web pages of your site meaning don't just put the same H1 tag
5:16:37
with the same keyword in it and keeping it blase we want to make those H1 tags
5:16:42
exciting to read but also used appropriately to break up the content so
5:16:47
remember all white hat techniques we want to avoid hidden tags we want to
5:16:54
avoid stuffing keywords we want things to be natural we don't want things to be
5:16:59
forced and your H1 tag should be 20 to 70 characters don't make long H1 tags if
5:17:06
we go back to our page example a short sweet tag here California fig banana
5:17:12
bread it's relevant to the content it's short sweet and breaks up the monotony of the content and more importantly and
5:17:19
again any content you have on the page should always answer the user's intent
5:17:25
remember people are using search to answer questions find information our
5:17:30
content should be able to answer that for them so according to John Moeller senior webmaster Trends Analyst at
5:17:37
Google header tags would definitely help Google for rankings in the search results so we want to use header tags so
5:17:44
when it comes to URLs we want to use hyphens and avoid avoid underscores so
5:17:50
if we look at this URL here this uses hyphens fig and banana bread so it's all
5:17:56
broken up with hyphens that's the best practice remember canonical URLs a
5:18:01
canonical URL signals to Google this is the original content so we want to use
5:18:08
original content and if you have multiple sources of content out there on say different websites we want to use a
5:18:15
canonical tag to signal to Google this is the original content please Index
5:18:20
this content and not doesn't hurt to use a favicon URL meaning a small icon and
5:18:26
helps to break up the monotony and help your URL stand out we can add targeted
5:18:32
keywords in the URL so again looking at the URL here I can see we're using targeted keyword as part of the URL
5:18:39
structure fig and banana bread and that is the H1 tag is fake banana bread so
5:18:44
it's all consistent and it flows naturally your URLs that are no longer
5:18:50
existing then we want to be able to set up a redirect for those URLs meaning a 301 redirect is a server response for
5:18:58
Google that says Hey Google this page is no longer available but it we permanently redirected it to this page
5:19:05
which is now available so that's what a 301 redirect does it helps signal to Google and all the other search engines
5:19:12
that if the page is no longer there that's fine you're just going to go to this page this is the page that's
5:19:17
permanently there now and another thing we want to do here is if you have mobile
5:19:23
URLs you want to include those in the site map and we're going to hit on that in just a minute but all urls should be
5:19:31
mobile friendly as well as desktop friendly meaning take into account this best practices keep your URLs short use
5:19:39
hyphens put the keyword in that URL and make it easy to understand want to avoid
5:19:44
capital letters in the URLs the URLs are case sensitive so go lowercase you
5:19:50
should always go lowercase from the URL readable URLs again the rule of thumb
5:19:56
here is if you understand what the URL is then Google is going to understand
5:20:01
what the URL is so the shorter the URL the easier it is to read the easier it
5:20:06
is to read the better chance you have to rank high on Google search so according to backlink to URLs that are shorter
5:20:14
definitely definitely help you rank so we want to be able to shorten those URLs
5:20:19
keep them short and sweet don't make them long and unreadable so those are
5:20:24
some on optimized ways or on-page elements that help you optimize now we
5:20:30
want to look at some website level factors that will help you optimize and write client Google search so good site
5:20:37
structure provides better crawling for search engine Bots and what do we mean by that well we mean having your site
5:20:43
organized in a fashion that Google's going to be able to find all the pages so so what do we mean by that create a
5:20:51
logical hierarchy structure so if you're selling shoes you know you're going to have a home page break the structure up
5:20:58
into men's shoes women's shoes Children's Shoes then under men's shoes you can have it by brand it could be
5:21:03
Nike Puma Adidas on the women's side it could be Nike Puma Adidas on the child
5:21:09
side it could be Nike Puma Adidas and so you want to keep the structure flow in a
5:21:15
hierarchy so we want to balance the amount of subcategories within each category so the men's if it has Nike
5:21:21
Puma Adidas the women should have Nike Puma Adidas and so you want to code your
5:21:27
site navigation and CSS or HTML meaning we want to be able to use something that
5:21:32
Google is going to be able to index so most sites are built in HTML and that's
5:21:37
what Google likes to index they like to index something that they could take back to their servers and then more
5:21:43
importantly build a comprehensive structure for internal linking so internal links mean that if you're on a
5:21:50
site you should have natural lengths pointing to other pages on your website so to keep the flow going we don't want
5:21:57
to have unnatural inbound things you always want to have natural internal
5:22:03
links to keep the flow of the user going from one page to the other so here I could see as an example all the
5:22:09
ingredients in this recipe well this has an internal link to another page on our site and this happens to link to a page
5:22:16
where somebody can buy the ingredients so it's a natural internal link so John
5:22:21
Doherty of Credo has claimed that one of the biggest changes that he can make in
5:22:27
fixing the Credo website is architecture so for example in Credo John Doherty has
5:22:32
increased the organic sessions by 74 in Pages by per session by 41 just by
5:22:38
changing the site architecture so you'd be surprised by changing the side architecture what that will do to
5:22:44
engagement and so let's turn our attention to secure versus nonsense secure so what we mean by that is
5:22:51
securing your site we want to make it sure that compliant with certain
5:22:56
protocols and so if we go back here we can see that this particular site is compliant it is secure https means it
5:23:05
has a secure license meaning the site is secure so Google likes secure versus
5:23:11
non-secure so non-secure would be HTTP so we want https as our protocol and
5:23:18
what that means is this enabling SSL certificates and that means when you
5:23:24
enable an SSL certificate that means your domain or your protocol is going to be turned to https so Google prefers
5:23:31
sites that are secure versus non-secure so if you use hsts as a protocol that
5:23:39
adds an extra layer of security over the https and
5:23:44
hsts prevents cookie hijacking so adding multiple layers of security always helps
5:23:51
in my opinion if you have an HTTP website a non-secure website you should
5:23:58
look into buying an SSL certificate getting your sites flipped over to https
5:24:04
because what's going to happen is your url structure is going to change when your url structure changes Google is
5:24:10
going to recognize that because they're going to index your site and when they index your site they're going to see those secure URLs and that's going to
5:24:18
work favorably in your favor and help you rank higher on Google search so
5:24:23
websites using secure or https have a higher chance of ranking higher so https
5:24:31
is a ranking signal because Google indexes those pages so let's also talk
5:24:36
about site Maps so sitemap is one of the most important ways to improve your website ranking why well because
5:24:42
sitemaps are a way to organize all your URLs into one file so we're basically
5:24:48
going to prioritize all our web pages in a site map so if you go to any
5:24:54
particular website and you type in sitemap.xml you're likely going to see
5:25:00
all the pages on your website so usually the site map is located in the root
5:25:06
directory so if I type in sitemap.xml I'm going to be able to see all the
5:25:11
pages in my root directory and I can also prioritize them I can also alert
5:25:16
Google as to how often they change and every page is going to have a date stamp
5:25:22
associated with it so Google can actually see how often it changes so remember we want our content to be
5:25:29
updated frequently so content's not updated frequently or it's not fresh then Google's gonna see that size that
5:25:37
date stamp that last modification down so we want to be able to make sure content is updated frequently we want to
5:25:42
let Google know that we change it frequently and we want to be able to prioritize our Pages let Google know hey
5:25:48
these pages are important to us so all that can be set up in a site map we want
5:25:54
to be able to add canonical versions of URLs in the sitemap so we want to be able to add all our original URLs in our
5:26:01
sitemap and so we always want to build Dynamic URLs site maps for larger websites and what I mean by Dynamic URLs
5:26:08
that means that if I look at this side map and we're always adding content let's just say in the form of a Blog
5:26:14
well guess what we want those pages to be added to the sitemap as they're published so as we add pages to the blog
5:26:23
or to the site then they should automatically be added to the sitemap and so in effect what's going to happen
5:26:29
is we're going to be able to see the site map grow with more URLs when the
5:26:35
sitemap grows with more URLs then that means then Google is going to index more
5:26:40
pages they're going to index more fresh pages so they're going to be able to get those pages that are just published
5:26:45
quicker so that's the whole idea idea behind Dynamic site Maps is we want to
5:26:51
be able to capture all the URLs just as they're published and we want to be able to maintain our site maps and so I would
5:26:57
always recommend a dynamic site map but you can always create your own sitemap
5:27:03
just by going to a tool called XML sitemap so if I just type in XML
5:27:09
sitemaps into Google search here I can see XML sitemaps generator and I can be able if
5:27:16
I have a small website just create a free and simple site map on my own when
5:27:21
XML sitemaps creates it or your platform creates a dynamic sitemap either way the
5:27:28
sitemaps going to sit in the root directory and then what we want to do in turn is let Google know where that
5:27:34
sitemap is so in search console we want to be able to submit the sitemap so
5:27:40
you're going to add the site map you're going to let Google know where it is it should be in the root directory and it
5:27:46
should be called sitemap.xml and when you do that Google's going to be able to take those URLs and index them so we
5:27:54
could see we submitted 528 URLs Google index 521 so one thing about URLs here
5:28:02
is when we create a site map we're putting all your URLs in there we do not
5:28:08
add no index URLs in your site map when what that means is that any URL we don't
5:28:13
want Google to index we're just going to exclude from the sitemap okay so we want Google to take all the URLs we want
5:28:21
indexed and put them in the sitemap so according to edgy using sitemaps for SEO
5:28:26
can increase your website's visibility and help you get indexed why because what you're in fact doing is taking all
5:28:33
your URLs that you want index you're telling Google how often they're modified you're telling Google which
5:28:39
ones are important and you're submitting that to Google and so Google's going to be able to take all these URLs quicker
5:28:46
index them quicker and when they're index quicker you can get ranked quicker and when you get ranked quicker you can
5:28:51
get traffic quicker so that's the whole idea behind sitemaps so let's turn our attention to page speed now so when the
5:28:58
last factors for our website besides architecture making it secure and adding
5:29:04
site Maps is we want to take a look at how quick our Pages load here are some tips in order to optimize page speed
5:29:12
because ideally the quicker a page loads the more engaged the user is going to be if it takes a longer time for the page
5:29:20
to load all the elements of that page then what's going to happen is the user is going to get impatient maybe leave
5:29:26
the website all together or go to another page and so we want to be able to optimize images so any image that's
5:29:34
of large size in terms of megabytes we want to be able to optimize that compress the image so that's one way to
5:29:41
speed up page speed we want to use a simple website design you know HTML with
5:29:47
CSS or cascading style sheets just a simple design with simple a hierarchy
5:29:53
and website navigation structure so nothing fancy nothing complex just a
5:29:59
simple website design with optimized images we want to leverage browser caching and we want to upgrade the
5:30:05
server response by meaning all your files are sitting on the server so when somebody goes to web page the server is
5:30:13
serving up all of those files the images the text Etc and so we want the server
5:30:19
to respond as quick as possible so when it comes to page speed we can look at the factors affecting page speed and
5:30:25
Google analytics so if I go to Google analytics and I go under behavior and I
5:30:31
go under site speed and I go to overview I'm going to be able to see what my average load time is for my site and
5:30:39
ideally we want our pages to load as quick as possible so that means anything
5:30:45
under four seconds anything four seconds or higher and it's likely the end user
5:30:51
is going to leave the page there's a correlation BP between page load time and bounce rate and so what Google
5:30:57
actually does is give you speed suggestions so if we do have a page that loads slow we can just go to speed
5:31:03
suggestions in Google analytics and we go to speed suggestions then Google's
5:31:08
going to be able to tell us hey okay this particular page load fast this potato page loads slow and if it loaded
5:31:15
slow why is it loading slow so here we could see the home page of the example is loading on average of seven seconds
5:31:22
well if we look here they're going to give us some suggestions so if I click on this page speed suggestions it's
5:31:29
going to load a report and a tool called page speed insights and basically what
5:31:34
it's then going to do after it's done running is it's going to tell me all the ways in which I can optimize my pages
5:31:41
not only for desktop but also for mobile so here I can see for desktop or for
5:31:48
mobile I can look at some ways in which I can optimize it to increase page speed
5:31:55
for example sizing my images properly server response time reducing my server
5:32:00
response time avoiding multiple page redirects so there's a lot of opportunities that we can do to speed up
5:32:08
page load time and all that's found in page speed insights and all that's found within Google analytics so remember
5:32:15
optimizing code minimizing redirects optimizing your images upgrading your
5:32:20
server response and all of those are factors and so again you can go into analytics page speed insights and you
5:32:27
can see exactly what Google is recognizing as what's lowering or slowing down your page load time so
5:32:34
Google takes site speed as one of the most important ranking factors why because they're going to rank Pages not
5:32:42
only with high quality content that are relevant to the keyword queries but they want those pages to have a good user
5:32:49
experience so if somebody clicks on the page then the user should be able to see that content fairly quickly and so
5:32:56
that's why it's such an important factor so the quicker your pages load the chances of you ranking higher are going
5:33:02
to be better so according to web performance today Walmart as an example experience to decline in conversions so
5:33:09
what they did was looked at their page speed and when they looked at their page speed you'd be surprised what that did
5:33:15
just increasing it from one to four seconds or decreasing it basically increased conversion so there's always
5:33:22
going to be a correlation between how quick a page loads and how engaged the
5:33:27
user is because if it's users engaged they're going to stay on the site and if they stay on the site then their chances
5:33:33
of converting are going to be higher so just even one to two seconds increase
5:33:38
and Page low is low time will make a world of difference in terms of Engagement and conversions let's turn
5:33:44
our attention to off-site engagement so previously we talked about on-page
5:33:50
elements and website factors that are fact our rankings for search results but
5:33:55
we also need to turn our attention away from our website meaning what we do on our website and turn our attention what
5:34:01
we can do for our website off our website and onto other websites so that's offside engagement and so let's
5:34:09
look get an example so that ice cream recipes blog so we did everything we
5:34:15
possibly could we updated The Meta tags the title tag The Meta description we added H1 tags we've made sure the site
5:34:22
architecture was sound we submitted a site map we we made sure the page load
5:34:28
was good and fast so we did all the things we're supposed to do on our web
5:34:34
page but we're still not ranking well what do we need to do well we need to turn our attention away from our website
5:34:40
into other websites we call this off side or off page SEO and we need to
5:34:46
basically generate links from high quality sites back to our site so if
5:34:53
we've done everything we can on our own website and we're still not ranking where we want to be well then we need to
5:34:59
turn our attention to other websites and so if we turn our attention other websites and other websites that are
5:35:05
relevant other websites that are of quality uh other websites that have high
5:35:12
domain Authority then we're going to see an increase in rankings so it's just a
5:35:18
matter of getting quality links from quality websites that are relevant that's what's going to move the needle
5:35:26
on search after we've taken care of all the on-page elements so more backlinks
5:35:32
from high domain Authority results in higher rankings SEO is a combination
5:35:37
between what we do on our website meaning optimizing the page and making sure our website has good site
5:35:45
architecture and follows the best practices in terms of site maps and Page load then we need to turn our attention
5:35:51
to the backlinking to improve our domain Authority so according to backlinko
5:35:57
analysis offsite engagement is one of the most important elements for ranking
5:36:02
number one in Google so you can't just focus your attention on updating the title tag and making sure the pages load
5:36:09
fast you have have to turn your attention as well to getting back
5:36:14
lengths from high quality sites that's off-site engagement and so getting links
5:36:20
back links from multiple domains is vital it's vital because they bring referring traffic to your site they
5:36:27
bring credibility to your site but more importantly Google is going to recognize the relationship between these sites and
5:36:35
your website and if these sites that have backlinks or links pointing to your site and if they're of high quality then
5:36:42
we call that passing linkages so it's going to bring quality to you in terms
5:36:48
of organic search so if we look at an example if I do a search for banana
5:36:53
bread recipe they're 241 billion results for banana bread recipe Why did this
5:37:01
particular page from Simply Recipes ranked number one well we can turn our
5:37:07
attention to Moz and Maz has a report called link Explorer and so Moz link
5:37:13
Explorer report helps us identify our own page Authority our own domain
5:37:19
Authority and how many links we have from other quality websites so if I put
5:37:24
that particular URL into link Explorer and notice the URL here is short even
5:37:32
though it uses an underscore when it should use a hyphen it's still ranked number one and why because off page
5:37:38
elements help this page rank number one why their page Authority out of 100 is
5:37:45
58 their domain Authority out of 100 is 82. and what does that mean well that
5:37:51
means that they have a lot of good links from other domains of high quality they
5:37:56
have 824 linking domains to this one domain they have 3600 inbound links and
5:38:04
they're ranking for a lot of different keywords so if we scroll down we're going to be able to see kind of a
5:38:10
breakout the quality of websites that are linking to them so they have 19 domains with a domain authority of 91 to
5:38:18
100 linking to them they have 15 domains between the range of 81 and 90. so what
5:38:24
does that tell me between 15 and 19 that's 34 particular domains that are
5:38:31
very high quality linking to them and so we could see the breakout of the linking
5:38:37
domains we could see the top file links to the site and we can see the page Authority so the link Explorer report
5:38:43
gives us an overview of what pages are linking to ours and it also gives us an
5:38:49
idea of what our own page Authority and domain Authority are because domain Authority and Page Authority both need
5:38:55
to be high in order for us to rank on Google search in order for it to get high we need links from high quality
5:39:03
sites so that's the whole idea behind off-site engagement so some of the offset engagements our influencer
5:39:11
marketing meaning is there somebody out there on social who has a huge following but not only do they have a huge volume
5:39:18
but are they relevant to our product for example Usain Bolt who's a famous
5:39:23
Sprinter if we're selling shoes and we're selling Nike shoes maybe Usain
5:39:29
Bolt can reference us on Twitter or Facebook that's influencer marketing
5:39:35
getting people to influencing people to buy our product we can engage with
5:39:40
audiences on multiple social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter meaning if we're running a promotion on
5:39:47
those running shoes then we can promote that on Facebook okay we can promote that on Twitter we can also bookmark our
5:39:54
webpage on popular bookmarking sites like StumbleUpon we can also put our
5:39:59
content on discussion forums like Reddit we can join High PR quality q a sites
5:40:07
excuse me and post answers to questions related to our business is like quora.com so we can engage in sharing
5:40:14
our content and answering questions so there's lots of ways to get links to
5:40:20
your website if you have a blog post as an example you can make sure that maybe
5:40:26
that content is shared on a similar blog post so if you have an ice cream recipe
5:40:31
blog post well maybe you can look at a dessert blog post and share your content
5:40:38
on that particular blog post and have a back link pointing from that blog post
5:40:44
to yours as an example and you can reciprocate so the whole idea of content is sharing the content but at the same
5:40:50
time I've shared it you're producing backlinks and backlinks help domain Authority so not only did it help domain
5:40:57
Authority but they improve the search rankings so in Google's eyes the higher
5:41:03
your domain Authority higher the page Authority in Google's eyes that means your page is important it's credible and
5:41:10
we're going to improve it in the search engine rankings it increases brand visibility if we have our content on a
5:41:17
highly engageable website a highly popular website or blog it's not it's
5:41:23
going to lift our brand visibility if we have Usain Bolt who's very famous Sprinter do some influence in marketing
5:41:30
for us then that's going to increase our brand visibility so anytime we can associate with something that has some
5:41:36
influence or some clout or high domain Authority then it's only going to increase our brand awareness and
5:41:42
visibility so again it's going to increase our domain Authority because of the association of passing link juice
5:41:48
from one domain to another it's going to then as a result increase referral
5:41:53
traffic because if we're on a high quality website that gets a lot of traffic then the chances of some of that
5:41:59
traffic going our site is going to be great and again it improves The credibility and Trust of our website and
5:42:04
that's what we want we want Google to trust us and a way to build trust is by by associating our website with other
5:42:12
websites of high equal or higher quality so when we talk about off-site engagement we want to do some guest
5:42:19
posts on relevant websites so if you have that ice cream blog go to another blog like the dessert blog and do a
5:42:27
guest post so not only that will that improve your brand awareness but it'll
5:42:32
generate a backlink and maybe drive some referral traffic you can participate in forms and blog discussions like core.com
5:42:40
or Reddit get your content out there start a discussion about a specific topic to engage users build brand
5:42:47
awareness and generate that backlink you can always you know put your your site
5:42:52
on a directory like Yelp for example or Yahoo directory you could prefer
5:42:58
testimonial link building meaning if you serve products or offer up a service well somebody can provide a testimony on
5:43:06
their website or you can just earn back links from relevant authoritative web pages like we mentioned quora or
5:43:12
Wikipedia or there's plenty out there so the idea is to associate yourself with
5:43:18
high quality websites but do it naturally you don't want to force anything so if you're selling a specific
5:43:24
service or you're selling a specific product look for like mining services or products that complement what you do and
5:43:31
that'll create the natural environment natural ecosystem that will eventually
5:43:36
give you the benefits that you need to rank higher in the search results pages so we don't want to purchase any links
5:43:43
we don't want to cloak content we don't want to just inject links on sites that
5:43:48
aren't relevant we don't want to just have site-wide links all over the place pointed to the same page and we
5:43:54
certainly don't want to be on low quality websites or directories it's all about quality not quantity with off-site
5:44:01
engagement so having an offside engagement complements what you do on your website for on-site to gather both
5:44:09
of the those efforts will get you higher search engine results let's
5:44:14
measure your SEO performance so all that hard work you've done with on-page SEO
5:44:22
coupled with all the work you've done with off page SEO are eventually going to net results and positive results and
5:44:30
we want to be able to measure that as you're actually doing the work as you're putting forth the effort on on page and
5:44:37
off page and so we want to be able to measure that and so you want to be able to understand what to measure and where
5:44:44
to measure it and so when we talk about SEO we really want to hone in on three
5:44:50
high level core metrics and that's ranking traffic and conversion so when we talk about ranking traffic and
5:44:57
conversion we can break that down into this list here what kind of traffic are
5:45:03
we getting from organic search what kind of traffic are we getting from mobile devices remember mobile is very
5:45:09
important because as we talked about with on page SEO as we talked about with local SEO a lot of searches start with
5:45:18
mobile devices we want to look at keyword ranking remember keyword research is the first step in the SEO
5:45:25
process even before we do any work with on-page and off page you know we want to look at the local visibility if we have
5:45:33
local SEO results we want to look at engagement metrics so all that traffic we're driving from organic search we
5:45:40
want to be able to measure how they're performing and behaving on our website we also want to measure some form of
5:45:48
progress on off-page SEO and that's in the form of backlinks so all of these
5:45:53
are different metrics we can measure using different tools so let's talk about how to go about looking at these
5:46:00
metrics and where to go look at them and measure them and so really monitoring
5:46:06
all this Behavior will help us understand how we're performing how SEO is performing and so really what we want
5:46:13
to do is start with Organic traffic and so we can look at that on a
5:46:19
month-to-month basis we can look at it from a geographic perspective we can look at it in terms of how many new
5:46:26
visitors we're driving versus returning and then again more importantly conversion rate and so to me the best
5:46:33
place to start to look at that traffic from organic search is Google analytics
5:46:38
and Google analytics is a free tool it's simply there to measure website
5:46:44
performance so if you go into Google analytics we can actually go in and we
5:46:49
can look at all sorts of data based on website behavior and so if I'm in Google
5:46:55
analytics and I go under acquisition and then I go under all traffic channels
5:47:00
over a given period of time let's just say the last seven days for particular
5:47:06
website I can see what traffic is coming from organic search and then I could see the amount of new users that are coming
5:47:12
from organic search I can also see engagement metrics bounce rate for example so I want to be able to see if
5:47:20
somebody's typing in a query clicking on our Link in the organic search results
5:47:25
and then coming to our website are they actually engaging with their website or are they leaving the website after only
5:47:31
visiting the page they landed on so that's all in these are all important metrics to measure and I can measure all
5:47:38
that right here in Google analytics if I wanted to I can even take it a step further and break that down by country
5:47:45
so if I type in country as a secondary Dimension now I can see what country is
5:47:51
driving traffic from organic search so a lot of your organic traffic information
5:47:56
is going to be centrally located in Google analytics so we also talked about Mobile Traffic a majority of searches
5:48:04
take place on mobile phones versus desktop so Google basically is reporting
5:48:09
the nearly 60 percent of searches now appear from mobile devices and so if we
5:48:16
go back to Google analytics we can also look at a mobile report so if I go in
5:48:21
Google analytics under audience under mobile overview I can see a breakdown of
5:48:28
the amount of traffic coming from desktop versus tablet versus mobile and
5:48:34
so you'll find as time goes on that your mobile device is likely going to drive a
5:48:41
majority of the traffic from organic search and so you can compare device information with channel so if I just
5:48:48
type in Channel and Google analytics as a secondary Dimension and look at the default Channel groupings versus device
5:48:54
category I could see that you know mobile from organic search is driven traffic over the last seven days this is
5:49:02
something you want to keep an eye on because a lot of people tend to begin
5:49:07
their searches on mobile devices so mobile ranking is different than desktop
5:49:12
ranking because with mobile ball ranking it's based on a responsive website and
5:49:19
with that responsive website basically response of being that the website's going to adapt to the mobile device so
5:49:27
it's going to respond to the device that somebody's on and so therefore the metrics or the engagement metrics are
5:49:34
going to be different but if I look back to Google analytics I can see again
5:49:39
bounce rate I can see pages per session average session duration so if I look at
5:49:44
line three I could see all the different engagement metrics compared to those
5:49:50
metrics from other devices and other channels okay so you want to be able to do a comparison because if behavior is
5:49:57
not up to par engagement is not the par on mobile then you want to do something about that so you want to hone in on
5:50:05
Mobile Traffic specifically from organic search because the behavior is going to be different you know people start their
5:50:12
searches on mobile the site's going to be different and so therefore it's a different experience altogether so make
5:50:18
sure you track the behavior and more importantly make sure you track that page speed so earlier we talked about
5:50:25
on-page SEO when we honed in on page speed so this is a reminder if I'm back
5:50:30
in analytics and I go back under Behavior then if I go to site speed then
5:50:36
if I go to overview I'll be able to see the average page load time on my website
5:50:41
I can also look at specific page timings and I should be able to see that by device so if I type in device category
5:50:48
I'll just be able to see how each page loads per device and so this allow me to
5:50:56
understand which pages are loading fast which pages are not loading as fast and
5:51:01
address those pages accordingly to improve engagement metrics so we want to keep an eye on page speed as well as
5:51:07
overall user behavior from mobile devices you can also use other tools that are out there like agency analytics
5:51:13
their plan plenty of tools out there I tend to use Google analytics because primarily it's free and Google analytics
5:51:21
is a Google product so it works with other Google platforms like Google search console we want to keep an eye on
5:51:27
ranking so remember when we do our keyword research we're choosing keywords
5:51:32
that have high relevancy high volume and low competition so we want to be able to
5:51:38
track keywords that we choose that have high relevancy high volume and low
5:51:43
competition and so the tool we use or at least I recommend using is Moz so I
5:51:50
mentioned Moz earlier with on page and off-page SEO so if we go into Moz and we
5:51:57
know what keywords we're trying to rank for we can go ahead and add the Namaz and what Moz does they actually track
5:52:04
where these keywords Rank and so if I go into Mods and I click on rankings I'll
5:52:10
be able to see on a weekly basis or a monthly basis how our key keywords are
5:52:15
ranking and for what page is the ranking so for whatever keyword I choose to to optimize for I want to make sure I put
5:52:22
those keywords in Moz because when I put them in Moz Moz is going to on a weekly basis tell me where these keywords Rank
5:52:29
and for what URL they're ranked for so that way I can keep an eye on ranking
5:52:34
over time because in theory the higher you rank the more traffic you're going to get and so we want to be able to see
5:52:40
the trend in which keywords rank okay so if I click on a particular keyword in Moz it's going to give me over a period
5:52:47
of time where that keyword's ranked be able to see Improvement in ranking for a particular keyword the whole idea behind
5:52:54
SEO is to choose keywords that are relevant optimize for those keywords so that you can be ranked for those
5:53:00
keywords in order to get the traffic and conversions so Moz is a good platform that helps us monitor rankings for
5:53:07
particular keywords now if you don't want to use Moz as an alternative you
5:53:13
can turn your attention to Google search console and so remember we talked about Google search console earlier when we
5:53:19
talked about sitemaps we also talked about mobile usability with search console we also talked about links to
5:53:24
your site with Google search console so Google search console is a good tool to
5:53:30
help you understand how you're performing with Organic search and so there's one tool in particular which is
5:53:36
performance that helps us understand what keyword queries people are actually
5:53:41
typing into Google search and so here I could see the actual query and so with
5:53:47
this particular website valleyfig.com I can see that dried fig recipes over the
5:53:53
course of the last three months had 5414 Impressions that means that one of
5:54:00
my pages either one or multiple Pages appeared in Google search engine results
5:54:07
5414 times and over the course of those 5414 Impressions I received 1100 clicks
5:54:15
so Google search console is going to be able to tell me not only you know how
5:54:20
many Impressions I received for a particular keyword but they also going to tell me how many clicks and if I
5:54:26
wanted to add more metrics to that I can add them like the average ranking
5:54:31
position for keyword the click-through rate so I can add multiple metrics to this report to give me an understanding
5:54:37
of hey or any of my target keywords being used or queried and if they are
5:54:43
where am I ranking and I am I showing up and am I getting clicks so search
5:54:49
console serves as a good alternative if not primary tool or platform for you to
5:54:55
measure how your organic search results are showing so for local visibility this
5:55:01
metric is important for you know maintaining local SEO so remember on the
5:55:07
local SEO we talked about Google my business so if I go back to Google my
5:55:13
business I can go into my account and so Google my business is going to be able to show me some metrics so if I go into
5:55:20
Google my business and I click on insights I'm going to be able to see a number of different metrics over the
5:55:26
course of a month I can see exactly you know what queries were used by how many
5:55:31
users and when I appeared so I'll be able to see how many views I receive not
5:55:38
only on search results but on maps then I can also see what actions people took
5:55:43
when they saw my results in maps or on search did they visit my website did they request directions did they call so
5:55:51
I can actually see engagement metrics right in Google my business I could see a Breakout by ZIP code I could see phone
5:55:58
calls by day of the week I could see how many people even viewed my photos so there's a lot of insights into local SEO
5:56:06
on Google my business so that gives you an idea of how you're performing organically on local search and remember
5:56:14
you want to be able to use Google my business to hone in on your specific
5:56:20
audience so all these metrics help you align with whether you're getting in
5:56:26
front of the Right audience and whether that audience is actually behaving the way you want them to meaning you know
5:56:31
are they actually contacting you are they going to your website are they calling you so local visibility and
5:56:37
understanding the metrics involved with local SEO is very important so Google my business is where you want to turn your
5:56:44
attention so overall engagement metrics are important they play an important role in determining rankings for example
5:56:50
we talk about bounce rate so bounce rate is the rate at which people go from organic search to your website and then
5:56:58
leave after a scene one page and not going any further so if they land on a
5:57:04
page and then leave the website after landing on that page it's considered a bounce and so bounce or bounce rate is a
5:57:11
good indication of how people are receiving our website or the content
5:57:16
that they're reading on our website there are other metrics involved like average session duration or pages per
5:57:22
visit all of these are engagement metrics and let's not forget about page speed so page speed is also a good
5:57:28
engagement metric all of these metrics affect or determine rankings so we want
5:57:34
to be able to make sure that if we're in Google analytics and we're looking at engagement metrics that our metrics are
5:57:42
good because if somebody comes to our website from organic search and there's a high bounce rate then what does that
5:57:48
tell us that there's a disconnect between what that person's querying and then the content that they're reading
5:57:54
and so we want to be able to address those engagement metrics so that we can continue to not only drive quality
5:58:01
traffic but keep the traffic engaged and then in turn drive up conversions last
5:58:07
metric we want to look at is backlinks so content having more backlinks from
5:58:12
good domains will effectively improve your SEO performance we talk about
5:58:18
backlinks with off-page SEO and remember quality over quantity and so we can
5:58:24
measure backlinks going back into Moz we can use moz's Link Explorer tool so
5:58:30
remember if I type in a domain Valley fig I can get some metrics related
5:58:36
off-page SEO including my domain Authority but more importantly I can see
5:58:41
what links are pointing to my site in this case valleyfig.com so I can see
5:58:48
they're 575 link domains I can see there's 7900 inbound links and so just
5:58:54
by clicking on that I can get an idea of the types of websites that are linking
5:59:00
to my site and their domain Authority and their spam score Google search console so if you go back into search
5:59:07
console you can also just click on links and we should be able to get an idea of
5:59:12
you know what website sites are linking to our site and more importantly we want
5:59:18
to be able to see not only what sites but what pages they're linked to remember we want our backlinks pointing
5:59:25
to Interior Pages not necessarily the home page so here I could see the top link page for valleyfair.com it's slash
5:59:33
recipes so we want links pointing to our interior page is not necessarily the
5:59:39
home page that's what's going to help your performance your rankings for all
5:59:44
your pages not just your home page so having quality back links pointing to
5:59:49
Interior Pages help boost the domain Authority and the page Authority for that particular page so again using Moz
5:59:57
link Explorer tool or using the links report in search console are good
6:00:02
sources for you to identify backlinks so when we look at these these reports we
6:00:09
want to look at the Domain authority of these sites that are linking ours the number of outbound links to the site or
6:00:16
specific pages on our site we want to be able to look at the ratio of Link
6:00:21
distribution you know we want to be able to look at how many follows and no follows so most of this if not all of
6:00:28
these metrics are in Moz so if I go back to Moz I can actually see you know which
6:00:33
ones pointing which ones are followed the total quality of the link that's
6:00:38
pointing to our site again bam so Moz link Explorer report tends to give us
6:00:45
all the information we need in order to measure and get a sense of our backlinks that help us with off-page SEO so there
6:00:52
are other tools out there there's hrefs again search console there's other SEO
6:00:58
platforms out there that'll help you measure backlinks let's get started with
6:01:04
keyword research so basically what we want to do is Center our keywords just
6:01:09
like our website we want to Center our keywords around or our content around good keyword words so the videos on
6:01:15
YouTube are no different than the web pages on our website so if we have somebody who states YouTube is the
6:01:22
world's second most well well-known engine well it is because it's right behind Google it's not a search engine
6:01:28
per se it's a video platform but if it was a search engine it'd probably be
6:01:33
second right behind Google so YouTube is pretty popular majority people use
6:01:39
YouTube search every day to watch videos on a number of different topics so they can find these videos in Google but
6:01:46
because YouTube's so powerful and so popular people go directly right into YouTube for their searches and so the
6:01:53
whole idea behind YouTube being the second most well-known search engine is
6:01:59
centered around keywords so if you have the right keywords for your video then the chances of you ranking higher
6:02:06
increases on YouTube so we're gonna share with you a few easy ways to do
6:02:12
keyword research this is the the most important step in getting your videos to rank on YouTube just like for those of
6:02:19
you who watched any of the SEO videos we produced at simply learn you know that keyword research is so essential to
6:02:27
getting your web pages to rank on Google well it's no different keyword research and choosing the right keywords is just
6:02:33
as important for your videos as is for your web pages so we're going to go into a few things to do here to find the
6:02:41
right keywords so we have the search suggestion you can look at your competitors we have different tools we
6:02:47
can use some other factors involved in Google itself so let's start talking about some of these ways to really hone
6:02:55
in and do some good research on your keywords to align them with your videos the first thing is search suggest so
6:03:01
YouTube has a feature called autocomplete so if you've done any searches on Google it's very similar if
6:03:07
you're typing something in to YouTube search then YouTube is going to suggest
6:03:13
other related popular keywords so let's take a look at that if we go back to
6:03:20
YouTube for a second and I just type in machine learning YouTube is going to
6:03:26
populate on the autocomplete in the search bar some other popular keywords
6:03:31
that we can potentially use or in this case if I Choose You Know machine learning tutorial I'm going to see a
6:03:38
video about machine learning tutorial so here you can see simply learns ranked number one for machine learning tutorial
6:03:44
but there are other videos that show up in my search result so we want to be able to use the search suggestion box in
6:03:51
the search box field so when we're typing in something new YouTube just like on Google is going to give us those
6:03:57
suggestions so if we're focusing a video on machine learning then you know we have some ideas of some other keywords
6:04:05
that we could center around because these are our popular keywords these are key words that people are using to
6:04:11
search on YouTube so that's one suggestion looking at competitors is another suggestion so we could search
6:04:17
for keywords used by our competitors in their video and title and description so
6:04:22
let me talk a little bit about that what you want to do is you want to go to that particular channel of your competitor so
6:04:29
when you go to your particular competitors YouTube channel you want to be able to click on the videos tab when
6:04:35
you click on the videos tab then you're going to sort by most popular and then what you could do is see a list of
6:04:41
videos and then when you look at a list of videos you're going to choose a video and then what you're going to do then is
6:04:47
take a look at the keywords used in the title and description and then once you do that you're going to have a list of
6:04:53
keywords that you can use yourself for that video so for example let's go back
6:04:58
to YouTube so if I go to type in simply learn here's our Channel page just by
6:05:05
clicking on simply learn I click on videos ever wonder if there's so now I can see all the videos ever wonder if
6:05:11
there's an easier way go back so here I could see all the videos sort by most
6:05:16
popular once they do that then I can choose a video this is the most popular video right now for simply learn if I
6:05:23
click on that video it's automatically going to start playing but what I could do is simply just look at you know the
6:05:30
content description so just by clicking show more I can see all the content that
6:05:35
align with this video that's one way to do it is simply by looking at your
6:05:41
competitors now what you could also do is look at the tags associated with the
6:05:46
particular video and so what you want to do is you want to look at the HTML and
6:05:52
so that means looking at the page source so just like web pages what YouTube does is they look at meta tags so if you call
6:06:00
from SEO in order to get your pages to rank you need to have a title tag and a meta tag description so videos are no
6:06:06
different what we're doing for YouTube is aligning certain keywords with the
6:06:12
video so if you take a look and do a search for keywords by viewing the page
6:06:17
Source you're going to see all the keywords associated with a particular video so for example if I go back to
6:06:25
YouTube and I look at the page source of a video Let's just say this video here Facebook's ad tutorial I'm going to pull
6:06:32
up the page source and all I need to do is control F and type in keywords and now for that Facebook video I can see
6:06:38
all the keywords associated with the video so you can see there's a lot of
6:06:43
different keywords we're aligning with this video and so why do we want to do that because we want you know our video
6:06:50
to show up for keywords that people may type in and so if you use that YouTube autocomplete it's going to give you
6:06:57
those ideas this most popular keywords so if they're related align those keywords with the video so here you can
6:07:03
see Facebook marketing Facebook ad strategy Facebook ads for beginners so forth and so on so there's a lot of
6:07:10
keywords we've aligned here with that particular video you and again all you need to do is look at the page source so
6:07:18
right clicking view page Source do a control F for keywords and you'll be
6:07:23
able to see the keywords aligned so you could do that for your competitors videos as well so you can see what
6:07:29
keywords your competitors using for a video that's most popular for their
6:07:34
Channel and is also ranking on YouTube and on Google so using the autocomplete
6:07:39
gives you those keyword ideas looking at your competitors videos also gives you some other ideas for keywords that you
6:07:47
can align with a video that's relevant that you want to rank for so let's look at some other ideas here so you can
6:07:55
install plugins and there are plenty of plugins available on the Chrome browser that will help you see the video tags
6:08:03
associated with a particular video so a couple of examples are vid IQ and tubebuddy those are extensions that work
6:08:09
in Chrome and what they do is they give you the exact tags that a particular video is using so for example if I go
6:08:18
back here and I look at a video on YouTube let's just say the machine learning Basics video I have vid IQ
6:08:25
installed on my Chrome browser so just by clicking on that vid IQ is going to
6:08:31
give me a lot of information about that video you're just going to give me an overview of their particular metrics
6:08:37
they're going to give me some other information associated with Facebook some engagement metrics really what I'm
6:08:43
interested in is those keywords so if I scroll down a bit here I can see the
6:08:49
video tags associated with the machine learning Basics video so vid IQ is
6:08:54
telling me is these keywords are associated with this video and not only does it show me what keywords are
6:09:01
associated I can also see where they rank so for machine learning Basics this
6:09:06
particular video ranks number one if I go down I could see what is machine learning and how does it work I can see
6:09:12
it's rank number two here here I could see machine learning algorithms it's ranked number nine so I can get some
6:09:18
ideas of the types of keywords that are being used as tags for that video
6:09:24
further down I can also see some Channel tags but really this is the video tags or the idea place I want to be able to
6:09:30
look to get an idea of the types of keywords that are associated with the video that are also ranking or not
6:09:37
ranking so that's another way for you to really get an understanding of what
6:09:44
keywords to use of the particular video so autocomplete you can look at the page source of a competitors video or you can
6:09:50
use a Chrome extension in this case I'm using vid IQ to give me some information
6:09:56
about the video tags for a particular video so according to an industry study
6:10:01
using keywords and video tags will help you rank well on YouTube so you have to
6:10:07
use keywords and video tags if you want your video to rank there's been a lot of studies YouTube is so pop popular and
6:10:14
videos are so prominent in today's world where if you have videos and you're
6:10:19
going to upload them to YouTube then associate the right keywords with those videos so some important factors when we
6:10:27
look at keywords what we want to do is look at search volume we want to look at competition we want to look at relevancy
6:10:34
we want to look at the primary and secondary keywords that we want to use so well chosen keywords will help you
6:10:41
rank so we just gave you some ideas on how to do some keyword research again those ideas were really to use the
6:10:48
autocomplete on YouTube or Google they're going to give you some popular keywords you can look what your competitors are doing by looking at the
6:10:55
page source and just looking at the keywords that are aligned with that video or you can use a third-party
6:11:02
extension in Chrome in my example I use vid IQ that gave me the keywords
6:11:08
associated with that video so you have ways to get the keywords so what we want
6:11:13
want to do is we want to make sure we choose keywords with high search volume they're going to drive more traffic to
6:11:20
your video however we want to balance it out with keywords that have load difficulty and are easier to rank for so
6:11:27
you don't want to choose something very broad that's just going to be very difficult to rank for and of course we
6:11:32
always want to go with relevancy so for talking about machine learning Basics then we want to choose keywords
6:11:38
associated with that and that's where that autocomplete comes in handy because what Google's going to do and YouTube's
6:11:44
going to do is give us keywords that are very closely related to the video that
6:11:49
we're trying to optimize for and so we have a number of different keywords at our disposal that are relevant that we
6:11:56
can look to see if they have good volume and low competition and so the whole idea is we want to choose a keyword that
6:12:02
defines the nature of the content and then what we want to do is support that with secondary keywords so we want
6:12:09
keywords that are highly relevant to the primary keyword so that's the way to go
6:12:14
about aligning your keywords you want keywords that are high volume low
6:12:19
competition or relevant and you want to choose that one keyword that is really what the content's about and then those
6:12:26
secondary keywords that support the primary so if you have a machine learning video you can choose your
6:12:31
primary keyword as in this case the machine learning Basics video so well chosen keywords help you rank well on
6:12:38
YouTube just like the machine learning Basics so if I go back to our video our machine learning Basics video if I just
6:12:45
type in machine learning Basics I'll be able to pull it up and so here it is if I click on it I'm going to go to YouTube
6:12:51
and so here I can see this keyword we know humans learn from is well aligned
6:12:57
because it's in the title it's in the copy and it's a line is a keyword tagged
6:13:03
with the video so we know that that keyword has good volume low competition is relevant because that's what the
6:13:10
video is about the basics of machine learning it's an introduction into machine learning so instead of honing in
6:13:16
on just introduction I mean machine learning primary keyword is machine learning Basics and then we supported
6:13:22
that video with those secondary keywords what is machine learning because somebody who doesn't know machine
6:13:27
learning is probably going to type in that keyword and then introduction to machine learning is a good secondary
6:13:33
keyword because it's explaining the basics of what machine learning is all about so primary keyword machine
6:13:39
learning basic secondary keywords what is machine learning an introduction to machine learning so that's the whole
6:13:46
idea behind choosing keywords you want that keyword that really is going to define the content and then support that
6:13:53
with those secondary keywords so remember when you're performing your keyword research choose keywords for
6:14:00
your videos that Google shows on the video results page so what I mean by that is your video can get more views if
6:14:06
you rank on Google as well so the whole idea is not necessarily to be found on YouTube it's also to be found on Google
6:14:13
Google so if I go back to Google and I just type in data science for beginners and I type in videos then you could see
6:14:20
we're ranked number one so even if you're not looking at the videos clicking on the videos link on Google
6:14:26
search you can always just when you do a search what Google's going to do is also put in the videos here on par as part of
6:14:34
the search results so what they're going to show you is the top videos that are ranking for that particular keyword and
6:14:39
so we may not rank overall for data science for beginners but we're ranked
6:14:45
number one in the videos category and so somebody's looking for a video that's important and you can see here that
6:14:52
these first two are ads so what Google is doing is they're saying hey this is so relevant this particular video for
6:14:59
the keyword query data science for beginners that we're going to show it above the organic listings even though
6:15:05
it's a video so the whole idea is to be found on YouTube and Google because
6:15:10
you're increasing your visibility you're increasing your chances of getting found on both search platforms so according to
6:15:18
backlinko google Ranks videos with keywords like how to tutorials so you
6:15:24
know a lot of the videos that you find on YouTube are going to be instructional based and so what Google's doing is
6:15:31
they're saying hey if somebody types in how to or tutorial or an introduction to
6:15:36
anything that's going to signal to Google that it's instructional it's going to help you rank so when you
6:15:44
search for machine learning tutorial or how to become a machine learning engineer you're going to get results
6:15:50
related to that because if you look at these examples we have machine learning tutorial in our title or how to become a
6:15:57
machine learning engineer so keep that in mind if you're creating a video and it's educational in nature you know use
6:16:04
those key terms like how to and tutorials in the video title because
6:16:10
that will help you rank so let's move over now out to video title so we want
6:16:15
to use our Target keyword in the title of the video and again we want to make
6:16:21
sure if it's educational to include that keyword tutorial or how to so for every
6:16:27
video title YouTube has a limit of a hundred characters so we really have to pick and choose really wisely so if we
6:16:34
look at the video that we were focusing on a couple of minutes ago so machine learning Basics here we could see under
6:16:42
100 characters we have machine learning Basics what is machine learning introduction to machine learning and
6:16:48
then the brand name so that is the title of this particular video so takes into
6:16:54
account the primary keyword the secondary keywords and the title and it also includes that really that key term
6:17:01
that really Google and YouTube like and that's what is machine learning so it's helping us Rank by having our keywords
6:17:08
in the title with that key phrase what is okay so that's a good tidbit on
6:17:14
creating a good video title is to align it with the right keywords your primary
6:17:20
and your secondary and so we want to use those catchy words and numbers to gain High click-through rates just like you
6:17:26
would on the title tag of your web page we want to do the same with our video title because the video titles what's
6:17:34
going to show up in search so if I go back to you know search here we could see you know data science tutorial data
6:17:41
science for beginners so we want to make sure in this case you can see data signs in five minutes so that was purposely
6:17:48
done so that hey I don't have time to watch a video I only have a couple minutes data science in five minutes
6:17:54
okay great I'm going to click on the video and now I have an opportunity to watch something and learn something under five minutes so choosing the right
6:18:02
words in your video title is going to help you get that click-through rate up remember clicked array is clicks divided
6:18:09
by Impressions and an impression is how many times your video shows up up and the search results on YouTube or Google
6:18:15
so we want to keep our click-through rate high and in order to do that we want to be able to write some really
6:18:22
good title tags for our video so use catchy words like a number or how to or
6:18:28
what is because that's going to resonate with people when they're searching now for the description what we want to do
6:18:34
is we want to use the target word at the beginning of the description the title
6:18:39
and the tags itself so if I go back to my video here machine learning Basics we
6:18:45
know it's in the video title and right off the bat if I look at the description of the video here I can see this machine
6:18:51
learning Basics video will help you understand what is machine learning so our primary keyword is in the first
6:18:58
sentence right in the introductory of the description and so that's going to bode well for optimizing our video the
6:19:05
description length is 5 000 characters so we have a lot of characters to work
6:19:10
with so if I go back to my video I click show more we have a lot of characters to
6:19:17
really describe what the video is about okay there's no shortage no shortage of
6:19:22
including keywords into the content so you have 5 000 characters go ahead and
6:19:28
see if you can work in naturally your keywords but one of the key tips here is
6:19:34
just make sure that first sentence starts out with that keyword that's a good tip of course you always want to
6:19:41
make it sound natural as possible you don't want to stuff it with keywords at the same time work them in naturally
6:19:47
work in your keywords naturally and then include hashtags in your description to help the audience find your video is
6:19:54
easily so if I go back here you know we want to be able to include hashtags so hashtags it's like anything else you
6:20:01
would use on social media it just signals to the end user hey this is what
6:20:07
the video is all about and if I go ahead and type in that keyword then it's our video has a better chance because it's a
6:20:12
line line with that hashtag and then there's Target keywords and LSI keywords
6:20:18
latent semantic indexing keywords we want to be able to use those keywords as
6:20:23
Target keywords with our video so if you recall the example I gave a few minutes ago we used the Facebook ads tutorial as
6:20:32
our example here I could see all the target keywords associated with that
6:20:37
particular video so don't be afraid to use those LSI related keywords meaning
6:20:42
keywords that are related to the content use them as Target keywords with the video so between your LSI keywords
6:20:49
Target keywords and then using our primary and secondary keyword in the
6:20:55
title tag using our primary and secondary keyword in the description and
6:21:00
then using hashtags in the description the combination of all of that if we chose the right keyword then we should
6:21:08
find that our video will eventually rank on YouTube so just just doing these
6:21:13
small tidbits with our keywords really help get our video to rank so at the end
6:21:19
of the day we want to be able to use the tools available to Us YouTube Itself by
6:21:25
looking at our competitors those extensions like vid IQ the autocomplete to really find our good keywords and
6:21:32
then incorporating those keywords into you know the title tag the description as Target keywords hashtags we should
6:21:40
really be off and running with our video on YouTube so at simply learn if I go to
6:21:46
YouTube and I just type in machine learning you could see we're right here is the first organic video on YouTube
6:21:53
for machine learning if I jump over to Google and I type in machine learning
6:21:58
Basics you can see where number or number one for machine learning Basics under videos if I click on all we're
6:22:06
also ranked here as well under the video section on organic search results another example data science for
6:22:12
beginners we ranked number one for that if I look at another keyword data science interview questions okay we're
6:22:19
ranked number two for that so we're ranking for a lot of videos and why are we ranking for a lot of different
6:22:25
content and videos on Google Search and on YouTube well we put a lot of work in
6:22:31
behind the scenes of creating the video and that's what we want to show you so part of that has a lot to do with you
6:22:37
know how our audience engages and sees our video so for example we're looking at a machine learning Basics video here
6:22:45
and we can see that it has over 221 000 subscribers for this video 234
6:22:51
000 views we've had over 2 000 people like the video and we have had over 270
6:22:58
plus comment on the video so when we get our videos to rank then we can see
6:23:03
there's a lot of Engagement and so that's the whole idea is when you do a video and you want to show up on YouTube
6:23:09
you want people to enjoy you want people to share it you want people to like like it you want people to comment on that
6:23:14
and that's part of the whole ecosystem of YouTube It's you know we're going to show you behind the scenes of what it
6:23:20
takes to get your videos to rank and then we're going to show you some of the metrics involved with some of these videos to help you stay ranking so
6:23:27
without further Ado let's go into how to get your videos to rank on YouTube so
6:23:33
we're going to talk about keyword research for YouTube we're going to talk about some ways to create high quality
6:23:38
videos to the importance of user engagement just as I showed you with the
6:23:44
machine learning Basics video all the shares all the commenting all the views and subscriptions then we're going to
6:23:50
get into how to promote your content and then we're going to just review a little checklist for you and sum it all up so
6:23:57
let's get started with keyword research so basically what we want to do is
6:24:02
Center our keywords just like our website we want to Center our keywords around or our content around good
6:24:08
keywords so the videos on YouTube are no different than the web pages on our our website so if we have somebody who
6:24:16
states YouTube is the world's second most well well-known engine well it is because it's right behind Google it's
6:24:22
not a search engine per se it's a video platform but if it was a search engine it'd probably be second right behind
6:24:29
Google so YouTube is pretty popular majority people use YouTube search every
6:24:36
day to watch videos on a number of different topics so they can find these videos in Google but because YouTube's
6:24:42
so powerful and so popular people go directly right into YouTube for their searches and so the whole idea behind
6:24:50
YouTube being the second most well-known search engine is centered around
6:24:55
keywords so if you have the right keywords for your video then the chances of you ranking higher increases on
6:25:02
YouTube so we're gonna share with you a few easy ways to do keyword research
6:25:08
this is the most important step in getting your videos to rank on YouTube just like for those of you who watched
6:25:15
any of the SEO videos we produced it at simply learn you know that keyword research is so essential to getting your
6:25:22
web pages to rank on Google well it's no different keyword research and choosing the right keywords is just as important
6:25:29
for your videos as is for your web pages so we're going to go into a few things
6:25:34
to do here to find the right keywords so we have the search suggestion you can
6:25:40
look at your competitors we have different tools we can use some other factors involved in Google itself so
6:25:46
let's start talking about some of these ways to really hone in and do some good
6:25:51
research on your keywords to align them with your videos so first thing is search suggest so YouTube has a feature
6:25:58
called autocomplete so if you've done any searches on Google it's very similar if you're typing something in to YouTube
6:26:05
search then YouTube is going to suggest other related popular keywords so let's
6:26:12
take a look look at that if we go back to YouTube for a second and I just type
6:26:17
in machine learning YouTube is going to populate on the autocomplete in the
6:26:23
search bar some other popular keywords that we can potentially use or in this
6:26:29
case if I Choose You Know machine learning tutorial I'm going to see a video about machine learning tutorial so
6:26:35
here you can see simply learns ranked number one from a machine learning tutorial but there are other videos that show up in my search result so we want
6:26:42
to be able to use the search suggestion box in the search box field so when
6:26:48
we're typing in something you know YouTube just like on Google is going to give us those suggestions so if we're
6:26:53
focusing a video on machine learning then you know we have some ideas of some
6:26:59
other keywords that we could center around because these are are popular keywords these are key words that people
6:27:05
are using to search on YouTube so that's one suggestion looking at competitors is
6:27:10
another suggestion so we could search for key words used by our competitors in
6:27:15
their video and title and description so let me talk a little bit about that what you want to do is you want to go to that
6:27:22
particular channel of your competitor so when you go to your particular competitors YouTube channel you want to
6:27:28
be able to click on the videos tab when you click on the videos tab then you're going to sort by most popular and then
6:27:34
what you could do is see a list of videos and then when you look at a list of videos you're going to choose a video
6:27:40
and then what you're going to do then is take a look at the keywords used in the title description and then once you do
6:27:47
that you're going to have a list of keywords that you can use yourself for that video so for example let's go back
6:27:53
to YouTube so if I go to type in simply learn here's our Channel page just by
6:28:00
clicking on simply learn I click on videos ever wonder if there's so now I can see all the videos I wonder if
6:28:06
there's an easier way go back so here I can see all the videos sort by most
6:28:11
popular once they do that that then I could choose a video this is the most popular video right now for simply learn
6:28:17
if I click on that video it's automatically going to start playing but what I could do is simply just look at
6:28:24
you know the content description so just by clicking show more I can see all the content that align with this video
6:28:32
that's one way to do it is simply by looking at your competitors now what you could also do is look at the tags
6:28:39
associated with the particular video and so what you want to do is you want to
6:28:45
look at the HTML and so that means looking at the page source so just like web pages what YouTube does is they look
6:28:53
at meta tags so if you call from SEO in order to get your pages to rank you need
6:28:58
to have a title tag and a meta tag description so videos are no different what we're doing for YouTube is aligning
6:29:05
certain keywords with the video so if you take a look and do a search for keywords by viewing the page source
6:29:12
you're going to see all the keywords associated with a particular video so
6:29:18
for example if I go back to YouTube and I look at the page source of a video Let's just say this video here
6:29:24
Facebook's ad tutorial I'm going to pull up the page source and all I need to do is control F and type in keywords and
6:29:31
now for that Facebook video I can see all the keywords associated with the video so you can see there's a lot of
6:29:38
different keywords we're aligning with this video and so why do we want to do that because we want you know our video
6:29:45
to show up for keywords that people may type in and so if you use that YouTube autocomplete it's going to give you
6:29:52
those ideas this most popular keywords so if they're related align those keywords with the video so here you can
6:29:58
see Facebook marketing Facebook ad strategy Facebook ads for beginners so
6:30:03
forth and so on so there's a lot of keywords we've aligned here with that particular video and again all you need
6:30:10
to do is look at the page source so so right clicking view page Source do a
6:30:15
control F for keywords and you'll be able to see the keywords aligned so you could do that for your competitors
6:30:22
videos as well so you can see what keywords your competitors using for a video that's most popular for their
6:30:29
Channel and is also ranking on YouTube and on Google so using the autocomplete
6:30:34
gives you those keyword ideas looking at your competitors videos also gives you some other ideas for keywords that you
6:30:42
can align with a video that's relevant that you want to rank for so let's look at some other ideas here so you can
6:30:50
install plugins and there are plenty of plugins available on the Chrome browser that will help you see the video tags
6:30:57
associated with a particular video so a couple of examples are vid IQ and tubebuddy those are extensions that work
6:31:04
in Chrome and what they do is they give you the exact tags that a particular video is using so for example if I go
6:31:13
back here and I look at a video on YouTube let's just say the machine learning Basics video I have vid IQ
6:31:20
installed on my Chrome browser so just by clicking on that vid IQ is going to
6:31:26
give me a lot of information about that video you're just going to give me an overview of their particular metrics
6:31:32
they're going to give me some other information associated with Facebook some engagement metrics really what I'm
6:31:38
interested in is those keywords so if I scroll down a bit here I can see the
6:31:44
video tags associated with the machine learning Basics video so vid IQ is
6:31:49
telling me is these keywords are associated with this video and not only does it show me what keywords are
6:31:55
associated I can also see where they rank so for machine learning Basics this
6:32:01
particular video ranks number one if I go down I could see what is machine learning and how does it work I can see
6:32:07
it's rank number two here I could see machine learning algorithms it's ranked number nine so I can get some ideas of
6:32:14
the types of keywords that are being used as tags for that video further down
6:32:19
I can also see some Channel tags but really this is the video tags or the idea place I want to be able to look to
6:32:26
get an idea of the types of keywords that are associated with the video that are also ranking or not ranking so
6:32:33
that's another way for you to really get an understanding of what keywords to use
6:32:40
at the particular video so autocomplete you can look at the page source of a competitors video or you can use a
6:32:46
Chrome extension in this case I'm using vid IQ to give me some information about
6:32:52
the video tags for a particular video so according to an industry study using
6:32:57
keywords and video tags will help you rank well on YouTube so you have to use
6:33:02
keywords and video tags if you want your video to rank there's been a lot of studies YouTube is so popular and videos
6:33:09
are so prominent in today's world where if you have videos and you're going to
6:33:15
upload them to YouTube then associate the right keywords with those videos so
6:33:20
some important factors when we look at keywords what we want to do is look at search volume we want to look at
6:33:26
competition we want to look at relevancy we want to look at the primary and secondary keywords that we want to use
6:33:33
so well chosen keywords will help you rank so we just gave you some ideas on
6:33:38
how to do some keyword research again those ideas were really to use the autocomplete on YouTube or Google
6:33:45
they're going to give you some popular keywords you can look what your competitors are doing by looking at the
6:33:50
page source and just looking at the keywords that are aligned with that video or you can use a third-party
6:33:57
extension in Chrome in my example I use vid IQ that gave me the keywords
6:34:03
associated with that video so you have ways to get the keywords so what we want
6:34:08
to do is we want to make sure we choose keywords with high search volume they're going to drive more traffic to your
6:34:15
video however we want to balance it out with keywords that have load difficulty and are easier to rank for so you don't
6:34:22
want to choose something very broad that's just going to be very difficult to rank for and of course we always want
6:34:27
to go with relevancy so for talking about machine learning Basics then we want to choose keywords associated with
6:34:34
that and that's where that autocomplete comes in handy because what Google's going to do and YouTube's going to do is
6:34:39
give us keywords that are very closely related to the video that we're trying
6:34:45
to optimize for and so we have a number of different keywords that are disposal that are relevant that we can look to
6:34:51
see if they have good volume and low competition and so the whole idea is we want to choose a keyword that defines
6:34:58
the nature of the content and then what we want to do is support that with secondary keywords so we want keywords
6:35:04
that are highly relevant to the primary keyword so that's the way to go about aligning your keywords you want keyword
6:35:12
words that are high volume low competition or relevant and you want to choose that one keyword that is really
6:35:19
what the content's about and then there's secondary keywords that support the primary so if you have a machine
6:35:25
learning video you can choose your primary keyword as in this case the machine learning Basics video so well
6:35:31
chosen keywords help you rank well on YouTube just like the machine learning Basics so if I go back to our video our
6:35:38
machine learning Basics video if I just type in machine learning Basics I'll be able to pull it up and so here it is if
6:35:45
I click on it I'm going to go to YouTube and so here I can see this keyword we know humans learn from is well aligned
6:35:52
because it's in the title it's in the copy and it's a line is a keyword tagged
6:35:58
with the video so we know that that keyword has good volume low competition is relevant because that's what the
6:36:05
video is about the basics of machine learning it's an introduction to machine learning so instead of honing in on just
6:36:11
introduction and machine learning primary keyword is machine learning Basics and then we supported that video
6:36:18
with those secondary keywords what is machine learning because somebody who doesn't know machine learning is
6:36:23
probably going to type in that keyword and then introduction to machine learning is a good secondary keyword
6:36:28
because it's explaining the basics of what machine learning is all about so primary keyword machine learning basic
6:36:35
secondary keywords what is machine learning and introduction to machine learning so that's the whole idea behind
6:36:42
choosing keywords you want that keyword that really is going to define the content and then support that with those
6:36:49
secondary keywords so remember when you're performing your keyword research choose keywords for your videos that
6:36:55
Google shows on the video results page so what I mean by that is your video can get more views if you rank on Google as
6:37:03
well so the whole idea is not necessarily to be found on YouTube it's also to be found on Google so if I go
6:37:09
back to Google and I just type in data science for beginners and I type in videos then you could see we're ranked
6:37:16
number one so even if you're not looking at the videos clicking on the videos link on Google search you can always
6:37:22
just when you do a search what Google's going to do is also put in the videos here on par as part of the search
6:37:29
results so what they're going to show you is the top videos that are ranking for that particular keyword and so we
6:37:35
may not rank overall for data science for beginners but we're ranked number
6:37:41
one in the videos category and so if somebody's looking for a video that's important and you can see here that
6:37:47
these first two are ads so what Google is doing is they're saying hey this is so relevant this particular video for
6:37:54
the keyword query data science for beginners that we're going to show it above the organic listings even though
6:38:00
it's a video so the whole idea is to be found on YouTube and Google because
6:38:05
you're increasing your visibility you're increasing your chances of getting found on both search platforms so according to
6:38:13
backlinko google Ranks videos with keywords like how to tutorials so you
6:38:19
know a lot of the videos that you find on YouTube aren't going to be instructional based and so what Google's
6:38:26
doing is they're saying hey if somebody types in how to or tutorial or an introduction to anything that's going to
6:38:33
signal to Google that it's instructional it's going to help you rank so when you
6:38:39
search for machine learning tutorial or how to become a machine learning engineer you're going to get results
6:38:45
related to that because if you look at these examples we have machine learning tutorial in our title or how to become a
6:38:52
machine learning engineer so keep that in mind if you're creating a video and it's educational in nature you know use
6:39:00
those key terms like how to and tutorials in the video title because
6:39:05
that will help you rank so let's move over now to video title so we want to
6:39:10
use our Target keyword word in the title of the video and again we want to make
6:39:16
sure if it's educational to include that keyword tutorial or how to so for every
6:39:22
video title YouTube has a limit of 100 characters so we really have to pick and
6:39:27
choose really wisely so if we look at the video that we were focusing on a couple minutes ago so machine learning
6:39:34
Basics here we could see under 100 characters we have machine learning Basics what is machine learning
6:39:41
introduction to machine learning and then the brand name so that is the title
6:39:46
of this particular video so it takes into account the primary keyword the secondary keywords and the title and it
6:39:53
also includes that really the key term that really Google and YouTube like and that's what is machine learning so it's
6:40:01
helping us Rank by having our keywords in the title with that key phrase what
6:40:06
is okay so that's a good tidbit on creating a good video title is to lie
6:40:12
line it with the right keywords your primary and your secondary and so we want to use those catchy words and
6:40:18
numbers to gain High click-through rates just like you would on the title tag of your web page we want to do the same
6:40:25
with our video title because the video titles what's going to show up in search so if I go back to you know search here
6:40:33
we could see you know data science tutorial data science for beginners so we want to make sure in this case you
6:40:39
can see data science in five minutes so that was purposely done so that hey I
6:40:45
don't have time to watch a video I only have a couple minutes data science in five minutes okay great I'm going to
6:40:50
click on the video and now I have an opportunity to watch something and learn something under five minutes so choosing
6:40:56
the right words in your video title is going to help you get that click-through rate up remember clicked array is clicks
6:41:03
divided by Impressions and an impression is how many times your video shows up and the search results on YouTube or
6:41:10
Google so we want to keep our or click-through rate high and in order to do that we want to be able to write some
6:41:16
really good title tags for our video so use catchy words like a number or how to
6:41:23
or what is because that's going to resonate with people when they're searching now for the description what
6:41:28
we want to do is we want to use the target word at the beginning of the description the title and the tags
6:41:35
itself so if I go back to my video here machine learning Basics we know it's in
6:41:41
the video title and right off the bat if I look at the description of the video here I can see this machine learning
6:41:47
Basics video will help you understand what is machine learning so our primary keyword is in the first sentence right
6:41:54
in the introductory of the description and so that's going to bode well for optimizing our video the description
6:42:00
length is 5 000 characters so we have a lot of characters to work with so if I
6:42:06
go back to my video I click show more we have a lot of characters to to really
6:42:12
describe what the video is about okay there's no shortage no shortage of
6:42:17
including keywords into the content so you have 5 000 characters go ahead and
6:42:23
see if you can work in naturally your keywords but one of the key tips here is
6:42:29
just make sure that first sentence starts out with that keyword that's a good tip of course you always want to
6:42:36
make it sound natural as possible you don't want to stuff it with keywords at the same time work them in naturally
6:42:42
work in your keywords naturally and then include hashtags in your description to help the audience find your video is
6:42:49
easily so if I go back here you know we want to be able to include hashtags so hashtags it's like anything else you
6:42:56
would use on social media it just signals to the end user hey this is what
6:43:02
the video is all about and if I go ahead and type in that keyword then it's our video has a better chance because it's a
6:43:07
line with that hashtag and then there's Target keywords and LSi AI keywords
6:43:13
latent semantic indexing keywords we want to be able to use those keywords as
6:43:18
Target keywords with our video so if you recall the example I gave a few minutes ago we used the Facebook ads tutorial as
6:43:27
our example here I could see all the target keywords associated with that
6:43:32
particular video so don't be afraid to use those LSI related keywords meaning
6:43:37
keywords that are related to the content use them as Target keywords with the video so between your LSI keywords
6:43:44
Target keywords and then using our primary and secondary keyword in the
6:43:50
title tag using our primary and secondary keyword in the description and
6:43:55
then using hashtags in the description the combination of all of that if we chose the right keyword then we should
6:44:03
find that our video will eventually rank on YouTube so just doing these small
6:44:09
tidbits with our keywords really help get our video to rank so at the end of
6:44:14
the day we want to be able to use the tools available to Us YouTube Itself by
6:44:20
looking at our competitors those extensions like vid IQ the autocomplete to really find our good keywords and
6:44:27
then incorporating those keywords into you know the title tag the description as Target keywords hashtags we should
6:44:35
really be off and running with our video on YouTube that's our turn our attention to creating high quality videos and some
6:44:43
of the best practices around that so along with everything we mentioned about choosing the right keywords we always
6:44:49
need to keep in mind that the videos we create need to be of high quality so the
6:44:55
content itself in addition to the keywords is a primary factor in ranking so in order to have keywords we need to
6:45:03
have content and in order to rank we need to have you know good content so let's talk a little bit about creating
6:45:09
content and what's involved with that and what we really mean by high quality videos so if you have a video content
6:45:17
that is not informative or irrelevant to the topic it won't rank so that's just
6:45:22
common sense so you need to create content that's aligned with the topic obviously and then that way you have
6:45:29
keywords that are aligned with the content so but if you have content it really isn't aligned with the topic then
6:45:36
you're not going to rank no matter how much you've optimized that video so just keep that in mind so there's a couple of
6:45:43
things we want to look at here so high quality content is determined by really two metrics so if we're not sure about
6:45:51
how good our content is and how good of high quality video we created we want to
6:45:56
look at audience retention and user engagement so audience retention is
6:46:01
simply the percentage length of your video that the audience has watched It's the percentage your audience has watched
6:46:08
so focusing on audience retention is important for people who want their videos to rank high so if you want to
6:46:15
rank you need to optimize for the keywords but got to keep in mind content so content is related to audience
6:46:22
retention and user engagement so audience retention percentage length your video of your video that the
6:46:28
audience has watched and for example it can be both absolute in minutes or
6:46:34
percentages so audience retention can be the average view duration or percentage
6:46:39
of the audience that watched then we have user engagement so yours engagement of viewers who are engaged with your
6:46:46
content and so that means they're either sharing it subscribing commenting or liking so those are all forms of
6:46:53
Engagement so the percentage of users who watched or how long they watched
6:46:58
versus engagement or in combination with engagement are two factors for ranking
6:47:04
so let's talk about some tips for creating high quality videos so we want to publish longer videos and so so what
6:47:12
do we mean behind longer videos so what's the reason for longer videos let's just suppose we have two videos
6:47:19
one shorter in length and one longer in length first video is 15 minutes long the second video is seven minutes long
6:47:26
so on average if you viewers watch about 40 of both videos then video x which is
6:47:33
15 teams long will have more than twice the watch time of the video that's seven
6:47:38
minutes long so remember duration we want you know people to watch our videos
6:47:44
longer so if the video is longer in length if it's 40 then it's gonna have a
6:47:49
longer audience engagement audience retention so that's one of the reasons you know from a metric standpoint so
6:47:56
even when viewers watch you know both videos the time is going to differ so we
6:48:01
want to take into account longer videos for primarily that region is because you
6:48:07
know it gives an end user an opportunity to watch the video longer and then it's going to help us rank our videos longer
6:48:14
so when we talk about watch time so if one video has higher watch time than the
6:48:21
other watch time is just the number of views times the average view duration so
6:48:26
another tip is we want to plan our video script so we want to keep the content
6:48:32
organized my recognition is you know create an outline first and once you create an outline of how the video is
6:48:38
going to flow then start populating with content and so to me that's how you can
6:48:43
keep the flow organized okay is really with an outline starting out with it on
6:48:48
how there's no videos are no different than say a presentation if you've done a PowerPoint presentation you always want
6:48:54
to start out doing an outline and then we want to upload a high resolution videos high resolution we don't want to
6:49:01
create videos that you know are small resolution like say you know 400 by 400
6:49:06
resolution or something you know something really small we want to create something a very high res so according
6:49:12
to back or link Oaks more than 50 of videos on the first page of YouTube are
6:49:17
high definition so high definition videos of higher quality are going to be
6:49:23
shown on the first page of YouTube more often than not so high resolution videos
6:49:28
organizing the content publishing longer videos are examples of of creating high
6:49:34
quality video we also want to make sure that content is relevant to the title so
6:49:40
if we're talking about machine learning Basics you know obviously the content is going to be about you know intro to
6:49:45
machine learning or what is machine learning and then the title should reflect that content so aligning the
6:49:52
title sets the expectation for the end user so when they see a title what is machine learning then when they watch
6:49:59
the video they're expecting to learn about machine learning and what it is so
6:50:04
if it meets expectations then the chances are that person who's watching the video is going to watch it longer
6:50:11
and that means it's going to fulfill the viewers requirements and when you align
6:50:16
everything accordingly keywords titles content then at the end of the day the
6:50:23
user is going to watch it and the more they watch it the higher the engagement the higher the engagement the better
6:50:28
chance you have to rank some other tips that you could use to create high quality videos so we want to be able to
6:50:36
you know use examples to clarify our content so you don't be afraid to go into another screen like I am if I want
6:50:43
to I'm talking about videos jump into the machine learning Basics video which I've done throughout this session I can
6:50:49
simply do that by keeping the user engaged here this video is about machine learning Basics well the titles online
6:50:56
with the video we made sure that we have a nice description about what the video
6:51:02
is about and we're aligning the expectations so not only that I'm showing you example within the video
6:51:09
itself so we want to use examples throughout your video to keep the user engaged it will also help clarify what
6:51:16
you're trying to express in the video itself so we want to make it visually appealing so visually appealing means
6:51:22
imagery or examples in the video and then when we talk about imagery you know
6:51:27
you want to use good images in your video so use public domain sites that
6:51:33
are available able to like Shutterstock or flat icon I mean there are plenty of those sites out there so feel free to
6:51:39
use any one of those sites to use high quality images in your video give more
6:51:45
information to your audience okay giving maximum relevant information can help gain more views and so when we talk
6:51:53
about more information again it goes back to you know the examples you use there's no should be no shortage of
6:51:58
examples here description use all 5 000 characters at your disposal imagery we
6:52:05
want to build up as much information as you can in the video itself to keep the end user the viewer engaged we also want
6:52:12
to create original content so always create original content you could certainly get ideas from YouTube if you
6:52:18
want to create a video about machine learning see what else has already been done do searches on YouTube itself but
6:52:25
you know when you're going to create a video yeah you can create another video about what is machine learning but just
6:52:30
make sure it has your own take on it you're the subject matter expert when creating the video create it with your
6:52:36
own original content have high audio quality and video effects so just like
6:52:41
you see here on this video we have effects in it and the audio is of high quality meaning no background noise no
6:52:49
Distortion and we want to be able to speak clearly in the video so you want to speak clearly loudly concise just as
6:52:57
I'm trying to do now so that you can understand what I'm trying to say or what the viewer is trying to to
6:53:03
understand when they're watching the video so watching and listening are two of the components and you want to make
6:53:09
sure both of our high quality avoid distractions we don't want to pause you don't want to ramble on a particular
6:53:15
Point too long we want to keep users engaged so you always want to move from one point to the other intermix it with
6:53:22
examples those are ways to keep the users engaged we want to include transcripts or subtitles for your video
6:53:29
so transcripts is just more content that's all line with the video and the
6:53:35
search engines will be able to pick up that content and help your video rank so to me that's a key component to creating
6:53:42
a good video is having the necessary content that go along with the video that outline I referenced earlier in
6:53:49
terms of organization you always want to have a Content outline so what topics are you going to cover in the video
6:53:54
that's why you need the outline to point that out confirm that before you actually start creating the video okay
6:54:01
focus on the initial 15 seconds so that's key you know somebody's going to click the play button of your video and
6:54:07
if you don't catch them in the first 15 seconds then they're likely going to pause the video or just go ahead and
6:54:14
close it out altogether so you want to be able to capture somebody's attention right off the bat and even before they
6:54:20
click on that play button you want to make sure again you're exceeding expectations that title is aligned with
6:54:26
the content so in your first 15 seconds it basically needs to be catchy but also
6:54:32
setting the X expectation of what the user is expecting so in this example here we want to pay close attention to
6:54:39
the first 15 seconds that's when viewers are most likely to drop off so we can
6:54:44
look at audience retention and YouTube so use the options above the graph to view absolute audience retention or
6:54:52
relative audience retention so audience retention is basically how many views a
6:54:57
video received and the percentage of the total number of video views and that includes every moment of the video as a
6:55:04
percentage so we'll show you an example of what that looks like so here if we go to the machine learning Basics video we
6:55:10
can look at the audience retention report and this is since it's been uploaded the lifetime audience retention
6:55:17
so here we can see a nice graph the percentage of people who viewed it and how long they viewed it so in percentage
6:55:23
so here for example I can see you know 43 44 watch the video for at least two
6:55:30
minutes here I can see 28.6 percent wash it for six minutes plus so that's the
6:55:36
audience retention it gives us an idea in terms of percentage how many people or percentage of people watch the video
6:55:43
at what length so that's audience retention so we want to keep that number high at the very initial stage of the
6:55:50
video and we want to keep it high throughout and that's why you always want to create high quality content using those examples using imagery
6:55:57
making it organized content not pausing you know going from one point to the
6:56:02
other those are all best practices to keep the viewer engaged and then we want
6:56:08
to add resources from well-known sites so throughout this video we've used backlinko there are other sources we've
6:56:15
used so if you have a source go ahead and put it in your video to add credibility and then we want to use cards to your videos so this cards is
6:56:22
basically a feature that recommends relevant videos to your audience so in addition to machine learning Basics
6:56:28
there could be other videos about machine learning that we can recommend or use two can recommend to the audience
6:56:35
to set up end screens you want to make sure that with end screens you can use
6:56:40
relevant videos to your audience towards the end of your video so you can recommend relevant videos towards the
6:56:47
end of your video you can also create playlists so this is a feature that keeps your audience engaged with
6:56:53
relevant content by Auto playing the next video so if you enable this feature
6:56:58
it's going to go from one video to another pattern interrupts keep the audience engaged so basically it allows
6:57:06
for your audience to stay within one video without having any interruptions involved and so going back to the did
6:57:14
you know audience retention report helps you analyze how well your videos are engaging to the audience so what do we
6:57:20
mean by that well if I go back again to my audience retention report how engaging was it well I could see 42
6:57:27
percent 43 percent watched it on average of 3 minutes and 21 seconds so to me
6:57:34
that's pretty good of course we always want a hundred percent of the video the video is seven minutes long if almost
6:57:40
half of our audience saw over half of the video then I would say that's pretty
6:57:46
good people were engaged so audience retention just is a good report to start looking at to help you understand how
6:57:53
engaging is my video and if your video is not engaging you know you can always go back and edit it or fix it or tweak
6:57:59
it so remember the average view duration for all videos and top performing videos
6:58:04
listed by all time we can look at that information as well in addition we can look at demographics so we can get an
6:58:11
overview of the age gender and location and we can look at playback locations report and what the playback locations
6:58:19
report does is it helps us determine the platforms where our videos are being streamed from within YouTube look at the
6:58:26
traffic sources where did the viewers come from devices did they look on mobile or tablet and so if there's any
6:58:33
doubts you know if you have any questions please drop a comment below but especially if you have any doubts on
6:58:39
the metrics so if we go back into YouTube we can look at analytics and if we're looking at analytics we can see
6:58:45
more and then this is going to show us everything we need to see from device type so if I click on more I can see my
6:58:53
playback location so this will show me where the video is watched it was on a
6:58:58
watch page or a channel page I could see the traffic sources I could see the
6:59:03
gender and age so if I click on the viewer age report I can see the percentage of views by age so I can get
6:59:10
a lot of information about my video and how it's performed who's watched it what they've done with
6:59:17
it where they come from all the information they need to know okay so it's all within YouTube analytics so
6:59:24
again if you have any questions about that you know just drop a comment below especially if you're new to YouTube you
6:59:29
may have some questions but just know that every video you published to YouTube high quality align with your
6:59:36
keywords you're going to be able to view the metrics by looking at YouTube analytics so let's talk about the
6:59:42
importance of user engagement so engagement is as we mentioned important
6:59:47
because basically we can't rank without engagement our videos won't rank unless
6:59:53
we have engagement so that's why it's important so engagement is somebody liking the video commenting sharing it
7:00:00
or subscribing each one of these is important to ranking so yes you need to
7:00:06
line keywords yes you need to have high quality content so when you do both of
7:00:11
those and you upload your video then it's up to the viewer and so the hard
7:00:17
work that you put out for the video is hopefully going to pay dividends with engagement so you want people to do one
7:00:24
of these four okay so let's talk about what that means so how do I get engagement so we already talked about
7:00:30
creating engaging content so there are a lot of tips to creating engaging content
7:00:36
and so according to wordstream if your content is entertaining then over three
7:00:42
quarters of the users are going to share it so that's part of keeping uh users engaged is keeping it entertaining is
7:00:50
part of getting a high quality video so remember on that high quality video when we say entertaining the audio portion
7:00:57
has a lot to do with it examples has a lot to do with it quality of the video itself has a lot to do with it so a lot
7:01:04
of components so all those components on a high quality video are going to lead to engagement so parts of what you could
7:01:11
do in your videos is conduct a quiz so meaning the quiz itself is a way to keep
7:01:17
people engaged in your video so that also help you get some more comments so according to backlinku video comments
7:01:25
help and rank in your video higher so just as I mentioned the last segment about YouTube analytics and all the
7:01:32
different different reports available on YouTube hey if you have questions on those just go ahead and add a comment so
7:01:38
that's a way to entice your users or your viewers to add comments is if they
7:01:43
have questions because you know with videos you're not going to be able to cover every detail or every minute
7:01:50
detail about a particular topic you can only cover in some cases the topic at a
7:01:56
high level so users are going to have comments or questions naturally and so
7:02:01
the comment section is a good way to remind viewers hey if you have a question or comment go ahead and put in
7:02:08
the comment section because that will lend to engagement as well so we want to add sources from high quality websites
7:02:15
that'll help with engagement okay use humor in your video we want to be able
7:02:20
to basically you know make it human based we don't want to be robots so we
7:02:26
want to be able to sound like you know we know what we're talking about but at the same time talk to the viewer not
7:02:32
know necessarily at the viewer or looking the other way and just going through the motions so adding humor
7:02:39
adding personality never hurts at the end of the day we are all human adding that clear call to action at the end of
7:02:46
the video will also lead to engagement so if we win the video with hey leave
7:02:52
your comments on this video or hey feel free to share this video with colleagues who are interested then that's a call to
7:02:58
action that's likely going to lead to more engagement reply to your comments as well so if you have comments we
7:03:05
always want to reply to them likely those comments are going to be questions because again as I mentioned even in
7:03:11
this video about how to rank your videos on YouTube okay there's a lot of information and a lot of information
7:03:17
sometimes doesn't get covered in its entirety and so we want to make sure
7:03:22
that if we miss something because we're only human that we're able to respond in the form of an answer to a question that
7:03:29
somebody leaves in the comments section so more comments also lead to higher rankings because it's engagement so when
7:03:36
you're getting high engagement and your video starts to rank well you know you're going to start feeling really good and what is that going to do look
7:03:43
at that feel good is going to lead to confidence which in turn is going to probably lead to more videos and that's exactly what we do at simply learn I
7:03:49
mean we're in the education business but we're in it to not only educate but making sure that our videos are shown to
7:03:57
as many people as possible so that we can educate as many people as possible so it's all it's contagious so getting
7:04:03
ranked feels good and then once you get ranked then you know you probably have good engagement okay let's talk about
7:04:10
how to promote your content so once you've done all the hard work getting
7:04:15
your video done high quality content optimized with keywords and then publish
7:04:20
to YouTube we want to let everybody in the world know about it right so we want to promote it we've done all the work we
7:04:26
want to promote it now so is it necessary to promote it I would say yes because once your video is published
7:04:32
fish you want to reach out you want to reach out to your audience not necessarily on YouTube but on different
7:04:39
platforms so if you're active on Facebook or Twitter that's an opportunity for you to post or tweet
7:04:46
something about the new video so when we say different platforms I am talking about you know social media platforms so
7:04:53
it depends on what you're active on so if you're active on Facebook yeah go ahead and post some of you're active on
7:04:58
Twitter go ahead and tweet something it could be you know on LinkedIn group if you're part of a LinkedIn group about
7:05:03
you know machine learning then go ahead and post something to that group to promote the video so that's going to
7:05:09
help Drive traffic to the video and then help with engagement so we want to engage with our audience on those social
7:05:16
media sites so it really depends on what you're active on so if you have a large following on Twitter then go ahead and
7:05:24
you know share that YouTube video link on Twitter with the Tweet that's going to drive traffic from Twitter to YouTube
7:05:31
Remember you know you're going to be able to see audience engagement or
7:05:36
retention by getting people to watch the video so you're going to be able to see right away by promoting the video and
7:05:44
driving traffic to the video how engaging it is remember the more people you have watched the video the more
7:05:49
engaging it becomes the better it's going to rank so it's an ecosystem and promoting your content is part of that
7:05:55
ecosystem so it all starts with social media if you're active on whatever
7:06:01
platform that is go ahead and promote it so you can also look at you know content
7:06:06
based social media sites or social media content based platforms like Reddit or
7:06:12
Flickr for example so you can participate in a forum discussion on Reddit so in this example here it's
7:06:19
about machine learning so we want to be able to post something about machine learning with the link to our video so
7:06:24
we can also go to content-based sites that are q a uh related like quora for
7:06:30
example Cora is a really good site where you know if you go there post information about machine learning or
7:06:38
the basics of machine learning with the link back to the video it's going to help because not only is it going to drive traffic but it's going to signal
7:06:44
to Google hey you get a lot of traffic coming from Cora this is going to bode well for this video in terms of ranking
7:06:51
so here's an example you know if you find a question that you can post on core then you're going to get people to
7:06:58
click on your video and respond accordingly on quora or you can act as the person responding to a question
7:07:04
that's already there so somebody already asked a question about what is machine learning you can respond with your video
7:07:10
as the answer so you can just simply embed your video URL as part of your answer that'll help Drive traffic so you
7:07:17
can also create your own blog and embed your video so in the case of machine learning here we have an example machine
7:07:24
learning what is it and why it matters so this goes nicely with the video so
7:07:30
here you can see the person the off author of this blog went ahead and embedded the relevant video in the blog
7:07:37
post so they play off one another nicely you can also opt in for influencer marketing meaning hey you can reach out
7:07:44
to somebody in this example here you know Katie nuggets posted information about machine learning so in this case
7:07:51
why choose machine learning as a career well they got information and then what do they do they went ahead and embedded
7:07:58
the video about machine learning Basics and so working with you know influencers
7:08:03
in a particular category or topic will help Drive traffic to the video you can
7:08:09
also create a YouTube playlist so playlists tend to rank high in YouTube searches so if you find yourself doing a
7:08:16
lot of videos we'll go ahead and you know go to your channel and simply on
7:08:22
your channel you can go ahead and create playlists so when you create playlists basically what you're doing is you're
7:08:27
organizing the content into different playlists no different than say the music you have set up on your you know
7:08:35
your iPhone or iPad or or iPod whatever it is you're using so you're just creating different videos in a
7:08:42
particular category and it YouTube likes it it's organized it's going to help you get your videos found quicker and easier
7:08:48
on YouTube Itself by putting your videos in a playlist so here you could see we
7:08:54
have entire playlist on machine learning trending Technologies cloud computing Big Data digital marketing project
7:09:01
management so a lot of different playlists very organized if somebody goes to the channel they're going to be
7:09:06
able to go to the playlist that's interesting to them and see all the videos there so it allows not only the
7:09:13
end user to find what they're looking for but it's good for YouTube because YouTube likes those playlists so we want
7:09:20
to engage our Audience by posting your video link on a community page so you could do that within YouTube and you can
7:09:26
prefer to link your YouTube channel in your email so you can also do that so for example if I go back to YouTube and
7:09:34
I'm looking at a YouTube video you know I can always Click Share so here I'm
7:09:40
gonna get a particular URL that's associated with the video and I can just
7:09:45
embed that so I can embed the whole thing in my email I can embed it on a web page or a blog post so just by
7:09:53
clicking share I can also immediately share it onto the social media platforms
7:09:58
that we mentioned Facebook LinkedIn Reddit okay Tumblr so there's a lot of
7:10:04
ways to embed the video not just not a blog post or influencer blog post but in
7:10:10
our email and on social media as well so here's an example of what we can do with
7:10:15
the YouTube discussion so we can also bookmark the video on a popular bookmarking site you know like stumbled
7:10:23
upon or read it or you know there's lots of other ones out there so there's
7:10:28
plenty of sites that you'll be able to go to and bookmark Mark that content so
7:10:33
that people can find it and you can always opt for backlinks so that means that hey if there's a blogger out there
7:10:39
that blogs about machine learning you can always you know ask that blogger to create a link back to the video and you
7:10:47
could reciprocate do the same thing so that helps increase the authority of the video so a lot of things you could do to
7:10:53
promote your video so let's do a quick review on everything we talked about in
7:10:58
terms of ranking your video on YouTube it all starts with the keywords so we want to identify a list of keywords that
7:11:06
are relevant to the video so we can use tools to choose our keywords but remember we want to choose keywords that
7:11:13
have high volume and low competition and so where can we go to choose those keywords well we can use the
7:11:19
autocomplete on YouTube we can check out our own competitors videos or you know
7:11:25
we could use vid IQ or tubebuddy or any of these extensions in Chrome to help us
7:11:31
look at the keywords that are tagged with a particular video so remember we want to have a primary keyword that's
7:11:38
aligned with the content then we want to choose LSI keywords as our secondary keyword or keywords that are related to
7:11:45
the primary keyword so we want to create high retention videos meaning that first 15 seconds of the most important but
7:11:52
throughout the video we want to use examples we want to keep it interacting by adding quizzes imagery good audio
7:11:58
good video quality so we want to focus on the user experience and we also want
7:12:03
to optimize our video content what does that mean well those keywords that we chose we want to use them in the title
7:12:10
we want to use them in the description we want to use them as hashtags we want to use them and tag them with the video
7:12:17
themselves so we can add keywords to our meta tag okay we don't want to overdo it but we want to add a handful of keywords
7:12:24
that are associated with the video so we want to be able to write I catchy video
7:12:29
titled and descriptions so remember use some of those key phrases like a number
7:12:35
or a question like what is machine learning so we want to use relevant meta
7:12:40
tags for the videos and we want to use popular YouTube tags so we want to be able to tag our videos appropriately to
7:12:48
watch the length of your meta tags so there are links involved remember keywords at the beginning of the title
7:12:54
Target keywords in the title description and tags we want to use interesting thumbnails to increase our click-through
7:13:01
rate ensure that thumbnails are relevant meaning when I say thumbnails I mean the actual title tag itself or The Meta
7:13:08
description we want to use hi-res videos we want to create you know videos with good high audio quality don't be afraid
7:13:16
to put in video effects like some animation don't be afraid to use examples and then you know obviously
7:13:21
look at the draft of the video before you publish it so does your video follow an outline is it organized so these are
7:13:28
all the things to take into account and there's there's plenty more you can do you know you remember once you create
7:13:34
and optimize that video you want to promote it you want to make sure that you're sharing it on social media you
7:13:41
create a complimentary blog you know generate backlinks from say other blog posts so there are lots of things you
7:13:47
can do to promote your video so before you promote it you want to organize the content create good quality content
7:13:53
align it with keywords once you publish it you know keep organizing it by
7:13:58
creating those playlists and then reach out on social reach out on different communities related to the topic and all
7:14:06
those things combined will help you to get your YouTube video ranked so again some key takeaways here use the keyword
7:14:13
research Available to You on YouTube you want to basically you know watch your
7:14:18
descriptions you want to be able to align your keywords with your title and meta tag description you want to be able
7:14:24
to promote your content on social media on social bookmarking though and I can't
7:14:30
stress enough create a high quality video first 15 seconds are important but you're going to know if you have good
7:14:36
quality video because every video has analytics associated with it so we want
7:14:42
to keep in mind the engagement so just by looking at the video itself so here I
7:14:48
can see this blockchain in seven minutes it was just posted just yesterday the
7:14:53
27th so basically already 42 likes 33 comments 378 views so these are all
7:15:01
engagement related metrics so you'll be able to just look at the front of any video and see how well it's performing
7:15:09
from an engagement standpoint so the better the engagement the better you of a chance you have to rank now when we're
7:15:16
talking about the trends there are significant shifts happening in organic
7:15:22
search the first of which is machine learning uh that is more artificial
7:15:28
intelligence analyzing search queries and and developing new algorithms within
7:15:35
the machine learning to serve up results determine intent which is the primary
7:15:41
goal of machine learning and to return not only the results but the information
7:15:47
you need as well as predicting information you might need in the near
7:15:52
future the second is voice search more and more voice assistance are becoming popular
7:15:59
through your smartphone through your laptop through home assistance and people are asking for information and so
7:16:07
it is completely happening at an auditory level not in visual level and
7:16:13
so how that is happening and how that affects SEO reporting is really going to
7:16:19
be a factor moving forward and then also as I'm sure if you've been doing any search engine optimization for any
7:16:25
length of time you are familiar with the struggle uh that has happened ever since
7:16:30
Google decided to strip keyword data out of any analytics reporting that took
7:16:37
away really the number one way that you were able to measure the effectiveness
7:16:42
of gaining keywords in the search engines now to hit each one of these just to
7:16:49
explain them a little bit more so that you know exactly what's happening and what it looks like as it affects your
7:16:57
current level of SEO work as well as reporting uh as an example of machine
7:17:03
learning uh if you go into Google AdWords right now and you were to set up
7:17:09
a campaign looking at maybe like auto body or Auto work or something like that
7:17:15
if you typed in a few keywords into Google what's happening is Google is
7:17:21
only reporting one phrase that might cover two or three or four phrases based
7:17:27
on for example Auto Body being is it one word or is it two words Google here is
7:17:34
providing it as two words so even if I type in auto body as a single word this
7:17:40
is where the machine learning is coming in realizing that these are the same queries and so rather than treat them as
7:17:48
individual queries what is happening is through machine learning is they are trying to figure out what is the intent
7:17:54
of the search and then grouping the intent into single categories or single
7:18:02
searches and then all the variations would be included in that now if I do
7:18:07
keyword research at a third party such as word tracker or something like that
7:18:12
now what I'm going to find are multiple different ways that people search uh
7:18:19
they're going to put in locations they're going to put in details they're going to you know use one word two words
7:18:25
and so in a third party keyword research format we're going to see a lot more
7:18:30
variations because those are tracking what people are actually typing in what Google is doing from the machine
7:18:36
learning standpoint is condensing everything and trying to group it into as I said similar forms of intent
7:18:46
now What's Happening Here It means that phrases or words that are plurals
7:18:51
acronyms typical variants uh
7:18:56
such as words that may mean the same thing uh but then they're different words so they're going to group them
7:19:03
together uh and then also as you saw there words with spaces or without spaces uh conjunction words as well as
7:19:11
hyphens and apostrophes a lot of these are going to fall out of what you're
7:19:17
able to bid on also in the paid search side and it will all go into a
7:19:23
particular group of words under a primary heading so that's where voice
7:19:28
search is taking us is really a condensing of the language into intent
7:19:34
what are people searching for and how do we give that their in how do we give their information back to them now
7:19:41
obviously this isn't perfect I've worked with a number of clients where
7:19:46
they may offer a service and because of that service Google is trying to then
7:19:53
associate them with another service uh and it's not relevant and so because of
7:19:59
that machine learning sometimes uh what we're seeing is a difficulty in trying
7:20:06
to get unique businesses new ideas or something that just isn't a part of that
7:20:13
overall big picture uh they're trying to force it into neat little boxes but as we know business is not full of neat
7:20:20
little boxes uh it's messy it's fuzzy it's it's all kinds of different types
7:20:26
of businesses suppliers industries that are going to have some level of
7:20:31
uniqueness about them so hopefully this can continue to improve uh but it does
7:20:36
at this point still need some human intervention the second aspect is voice search and
7:20:43
maybe some of you have uh maybe the Google home or the Alexa Appliance in
7:20:48
your home and you've been playing around with it and seeing what it can do uh but
7:20:53
also everyone's phone uh and then also Cortana is on uh any Microsoft operating
7:21:00
system desktop and so being able to search from your phone simply by a voice
7:21:08
command uh now this is affecting our ability to report because this does not
7:21:15
show up uh as a search now if you're using Google now and you are searching
7:21:23
on Google or a Google app it will show up as a search referral however if
7:21:29
you're using Cortana if you're using uh Siri it's going to use the
7:21:34
search engine of the operating system and so in that case and I'm going to address this a little bit later it shows
7:21:41
up as a direct visit rather than uh a search initiated visit and so this is
7:21:47
affecting the reporting of SEO metrics uh but at the same time it is also
7:21:53
changing the search landscape entirely right now uh Amazon is probably Google's
7:22:00
biggest competitor for most searches especially for electronics uh especially
7:22:06
for uh what you would consider things for Home and Garden Amazon and right now
7:22:15
has taken about 40 percent of the market share away from Google in terms of
7:22:20
electronics and Home Products because people are going to Amazon first and
7:22:26
they're using Alexa to do this so how voice search it really is going to be uh
7:22:33
a volatile industry to follow over the next five years
7:22:38
and then as I mentioned before probably the biggest frustration of anyone doing search engine optimization or wanting to
7:22:46
measure the effectiveness of optimization or where they stand in the marketplace is the keyword not provided
7:22:53
now there's a number of reasons why Google has gone about this the first reason that they gave was for privacy
7:23:01
reasons that they wanted people's searches to be private but at the same time if you are doing paid search you
7:23:09
have full access to keywords and also if you are advertising through Google you
7:23:15
can Target People based on their Search terms so we know the Privacy thing uh was really kind of a smoke screen I
7:23:22
think what's going on here is that this was really the first step to getting
7:23:27
people away from thinking of individual keywords or key phrases and focusing on
7:23:36
one or two phrases that there that would describe their business by taking away
7:23:42
the vast majority of keywords that you're going to see in your analytics it will force you to look at other words it
7:23:49
will force you to think bigger picture rather than those one or two words that
7:23:54
most people believe that's what my business needs this is where I'm going to focus my attention and in in so in
7:24:03
some ways this has been good by making people forcing people to think Beyond a
7:24:10
single word or a single phrase about their business and looking into the bigger picture this also plays into the
7:24:17
machine learning because as I showed you before machine learning is condensing all of these keyword phrases trying to
7:24:24
determine intent and what better way to really assist that than to start taking
7:24:29
away keyword data in the search engines however when you take that away you have
7:24:35
then taken away the number one reporting fact after uh of SEO and that is what
7:24:42
keywords am I ranking for what keywords are bringing in not only visitors but business and so by taking away the
7:24:49
number one factor we're forced to look at a number of different methods that we can use then to develop better campaign
7:24:57
metrics now one of the first things about uh metrics is the expectations whenever I
7:25:05
work with a company I want to know specifically what are your expectations for the campaign what are you trying to
7:25:12
get out of it what do you expect uh I'll never forget I was Consulting with an
7:25:19
agency about how they are developing their SEO campaigns and how they were
7:25:25
reporting them to their clients uh and I went with them oops to one of their
7:25:30
client meetings and after some of the agency people left
7:25:37
um I asked if I could talk with a client for a bit after the meeting and because the main reason was on this white board
7:25:44
in the corner of their office uh they had visits this month and visits last month
7:25:49
and the client asked me about the agency
7:25:54
um you know what I was doing for them and what they what the agency was trying to do and then they said that they had
7:26:01
concerns and the reason why they had concerns is that the visits last month
7:26:06
uh were higher than the visits this month and that over the past few months
7:26:12
the number of visits had been going down and because of that they were having a
7:26:18
lack of confidence in their agency now this was really kind of surprising
7:26:23
because this goes right to the heart of client expectations
7:26:28
uh no when I had asked that client then after that you know towards the end of
7:26:33
the conversation is how how is your business how are leads how are your key
7:26:39
performance indicators how are the conversions on the site
7:26:46
basically asking them how's business uh and the response to that was well
7:26:51
business is great business has been improving over the past few months however the primary metrics they were
7:26:58
looking at was visits rather than the business oriented metrics and so this is
7:27:04
where establishing expectations of what campaign metrics we're going to follow
7:27:10
and what those campaign metrics mean to a business this is a conversation that
7:27:17
must take place rather than just reporting basic information the same
7:27:23
charts and graphs every month or every quarter that really might not communicate the information that
7:27:30
everyone needs and so a conversation between agencies and clients about what
7:27:36
are the expectations of this SEO campaign what do we want out of that and what constitutes success that
7:27:42
conversation needs to take place and then that will determine how the
7:27:48
campaign metrics are then developed and presented and the discussion that will
7:27:55
happen around them now one thing that I think has been uh
7:28:00
you know I would say both a struggle as well as what needs to happen the the first thing about SEO metrics is the
7:28:08
myth of the number one ranking once in a while I'll still run into this where
7:28:14
someone will hinge the entire success of a campaign
7:28:19
by seeing the number one ranking they want a single word or a tooth word
7:28:25
phrase to rank number one in Google and that is their only standard of success
7:28:32
unfortunately I you know anymore I will not even work with that kind of a client
7:28:38
because it's an unrealistic expectation and it also shows a complete ignorance of how search works and what it the
7:28:45
power of what it can bring to your business that this is much bigger than a number one ranking and if that's all you
7:28:52
want then give me a budget we'll pay for it uh but I would say for the most part
7:28:58
we've moved Beyond a number one ranking uh and now what we have to educate
7:29:05
people on is that rankings are really a personal metric that you the rankings
7:29:11
you see are probably going to be slightly different than every body else
7:29:16
and I'm going to walk through why that happens and so you can help educate
7:29:21
people within your own organization of why ranking is a personal metric now rather than a universal metric
7:29:29
and then of course as I had mentioned before it's on the expectations
7:29:35
campaign metrics need to focus on the business objectives not just on the
7:29:41
external factors of rankings and and somewhat invisibility uh we want to look
7:29:47
at the visibility of a company but ultimately what we need to look at is how is your search campaign
7:29:54
delivering on your business objectives because that's the point of it all is
7:30:00
what are we what are we trying to accomplish and how is it being accomplished
7:30:06
see it's when I see charts like this that still make me a little queasy and
7:30:12
still make me roll my eyes this was done uh about two years ago asking people what are you measuring and unfortunately
7:30:19
there hasn't been much change since this initial survey that the vast majority of
7:30:25
people are measuring the number of visits to the website uh and then they're measuring social
7:30:31
sharing time on site and less than half are still measuring SEO rankings
7:30:39
um now that still boggles my mind because that's what I'm going to walk through here is why we can't measure SEO
7:30:45
rankings it is a completely undependable metric and so
7:30:51
what what really surprises me shocks me is that 35 percent of people are
7:30:59
measuring subscriber growth and 27 a little more than a fourth of businesses
7:31:05
surveyed here are measuring sales leads this is what is so shocking and
7:31:12
surprising especially when we come to campaign metrics and expectations of a
7:31:17
client and that is what are the business objectives what is it that you want to
7:31:23
grow because the last column here sales leads is what makes business grow that
7:31:29
is a direct contributor to revenue and subscriber growth well that builds
7:31:37
my list and marketing to my list is a direct contributor to revenue
7:31:43
and so as I said this is just so mind-boggling because the two things
7:31:48
that directly contribute that have a direct impact on Revenue are the least
7:31:55
measured in this survey the four things that have an indirect impact uh meaning
7:32:02
that you can have is as I mentioned before an incredible number of website visits but absolutely no Revenue coming
7:32:09
in as a result of that these are all key performance indicators
7:32:14
visits sharing time on site those are key performance indicators they're not
7:32:21
business objectives and so part of the expectations of developing campaign
7:32:27
metrics is understanding the difference between a key performance indicator and
7:32:33
a business objective because it's easy to get sidetracked especially with
7:32:38
search metrics especially with these types of things of you know visits time
7:32:44
on site uh page views rankings but they're all indirect which is why they
7:32:50
are under the key performance indicator uh grouping whereas we want to look at
7:32:56
the business objectives of subscribers sales leads downloads getting
7:33:01
information into people's hands engaging with them and moving along the customer
7:33:06
Journey when we can develop metrics that Focus on the experience of a prospect or
7:33:14
a customer then tie that to our SEO performance now
7:33:21
we're developing how our Campaign Will directly impact the business and the
7:33:27
customer now I want to just go off to the side for a little bit here and talk about
7:33:34
rankings and this is the whole concept of rankings are personal not Universal
7:33:39
now you'll notice on this this is the this is a a rankings report from 2008
7:33:45
and compared to 2006. I had to go back really far to find this screenshot and
7:33:52
this is of uh if you were doing a search for the keyword latest news this would
7:33:58
show you who ranked number one uh and the change in the rankings over the past
7:34:04
two years and it also we're looking at it in Google and MSN for some of you
7:34:10
this may look really familiar because what this did is you put in the domains
7:34:16
that you were tracking the keywords and you would get a report about who ranks
7:34:21
where for what keyword now this is back in the day and even around 2008 uh we
7:34:29
were still seeing some or we were starting to see fluctuations in rankings based on where you are searching from as
7:34:37
well as some history coming in but we weren't seeing it to the extent that we
7:34:43
see it today you see now today your rankings that you
7:34:48
see are largely based on your search history it's based on past searches it's based
7:34:55
on content preferences uh what types of content you tend to search on click on or visit uh what business or industry
7:35:03
you tend to uh search on as well as any
7:35:09
behaviors such as your uh predilection to click on ads paid ads display ads or
7:35:16
anything like that and so what's happening here is this has been actually going on for the past 10 years is that
7:35:23
more and more of your rankings are going to be personalized to your unique
7:35:28
history and the words the sites that you visit the words you use uh the types of
7:35:35
queries that you make all of this is being developed in order to provide you
7:35:41
the most relevant personal results ultimately it's also being done in order
7:35:48
to focus the paid search ads specifically to you and your behavior
7:35:54
and the industry that you're in because that's how the search engines monetize
7:35:59
so the better they understand you and what you're looking for and again it all comes down to intent if they can figure
7:36:06
out your intent and provide you results that are relevant both paid and organic
7:36:13
then that's the goal that's what they're trying to do and so simply based on your
7:36:19
history we're seeing that rankings are going to vary from person to person and
7:36:25
maybe even from computer to computer to smartphone depending upon how you use
7:36:30
them the second thing is Regional results uh
7:36:36
if you search for specific things in one region it's going to show up differently in
7:36:42
other regions if I search for right now if I go to Google and type in for dealership I'm going to see the one
7:36:49
that's near me and I'm not going to see one that's out in another state or
7:36:55
another region because based on the localization that search engines are
7:37:00
providing it's going to look at that query as a localized result and serve it
7:37:07
to me specifically So based on location now sometimes we will see things brands
7:37:14
are more Global however if I'm looking for something that is specific to my region that can be based on my IP
7:37:21
address my country my city my state even into a zip code uh local results
7:37:28
targeted results can be limited to a small area to only show to people who
7:37:35
are within that area or searching in that area and so more and more based on
7:37:41
localization we're seeing that affect the results and that has been highly
7:37:47
impactful especially over the past two to three years as local search has just gotten miles better uh in all of the
7:37:56
search engines and it's only going to increase as well uh but then also based on the different
7:38:03
types of media based on language based on the type of search uh the intent of
7:38:10
search or what words you might use as well as here we have the machine learning come in what you'll notice here
7:38:17
is simply if I do a search for something in Spanish as compared to English I get different results I get a completely
7:38:23
different results page uh there's more videos on the Spanish results uh from
7:38:29
the Spanish search then the English uh also the makeup of the page is
7:38:34
completely different so the words you use how you structure the query the
7:38:40
language those are all going to affect the type of results that you see and then also as you can see here is that
7:38:48
the organic results you know we're seeing videos uh taking over results how
7:38:54
to's uh actual uh you know multiple things happening in the search engine
7:39:00
and results page and so it's no longer just a list of 10 links and running a
7:39:06
ranking report to see where you rank because What's Happening Here is we're seeing multiple videos being served
7:39:13
prior to even seeing any what you would call a traditional link or traditional
7:39:21
website snippet here showing up in the search engine results page so as you can
7:39:26
see all of these things are just completely transforming a individual's rankings and so if you
7:39:35
were to measure rankings what you're measuring is unreality uh you're you're
7:39:42
measuring something that doesn't exist uh and as I like to say it's a it's
7:39:48
extinct before it's even run because no person will ever see a ranking report
7:39:56
they will see that reflected in their results it's going to be personalized
7:40:01
and unique something also to throw into the mix that even based on your device
7:40:06
you are going to see different results primary reason is because if you're
7:40:13
using a smartphone it knows your location and so you're going to have location results mixed in also based on
7:40:21
contracts with different search providers uh with different uh
7:40:27
you know licensing from Google licensing from YouTube uh the results will be
7:40:33
different based on the phone you use based on the provider that you have uh
7:40:39
and based on uh simply just being mobile as opposed to desktop so results are different based on the
7:40:47
device so hopefully if anyone uh was hoping to run a simple ranking report as
7:40:53
an SEO campaign metric uh just this little side light here has shown it's
7:40:58
really a non-starter anymore the traditional ranking report is extinct
7:41:04
and we have to move beyond that so how do we move beyond that because there's
7:41:10
also now that I just shared the the difficulties of a traditional ranking report we also have a couple other
7:41:17
obstacles thrown at us that are specifically uh both from a search
7:41:23
engine standpoint and from a user standpoint the first obstacle that we're running
7:41:29
into is from a search engine standpoint this is what Google is doing if I do a
7:41:34
search for top car reviews in 2017 at the very top of the results
7:41:40
I get a snippet of information uh pulled from Consumer Reports now
7:41:47
what's happening here and you may have seen this as well if you type a question or something like that that Google is
7:41:53
not only displaying websites but they're displaying the answers and they're
7:41:59
pulling the content from these websites now when they do that that does not show
7:42:05
up as a visit and it doesn't show up as a ranking to Consumer Reports Consumer
7:42:11
Reports has no method of tracking this
7:42:17
visibility and it's incredible visibility so at one point Google is
7:42:23
providing information to the searcher but the owner of this result is having
7:42:29
its content displayed by Google without any knowledge that it's happening unless someone has gotten in in order to see
7:42:36
that so this is a significant amount of visibility that right now goes
7:42:44
unreported because there's no way to integrate this into any metric
7:42:49
calculation uh other than a visual inspection to see what's happening with
7:42:56
this we're going to see more and more of this Google is presenting more and more
7:43:01
answers through the search engine results page rather than just the website
7:43:07
the main reason is Google has seen the more they do this the more they deliver
7:43:12
the answer in the search engine results page rather than having people click
7:43:17
through to go to a website they find that people are more likely to come back and use Google again
7:43:24
and what's happening here is that Google essentially is eliminating The Click
7:43:31
through they're trying to keep people on the search engine results page as long as
7:43:37
possible think about some of the searches you've done recently if you search for weather information you
7:43:43
search for flight information if you search for sports scores on Google uh those types of things you're going to
7:43:50
get your answer in the search results page you don't even have to click anywhere else to get the information
7:43:55
it's right there this is going to not only grow under
7:44:01
Google but this is really the big question mark as to what is the whole
7:44:07
purpose of Google and what are they doing and how does it benefit me as a website being in these results when I
7:44:14
can't track this and when Google is trying to keep people on their site on
7:44:19
their property as long as possible this is the big question mark moving forward for SEO metrics
7:44:26
the other side of this is from a consumer standpoint and this is what we call dark search dark search are
7:44:34
searches that originate from a non-traditional search engine for
7:44:40
example if you do a search from your computer for example Cortana or if you
7:44:47
do a search from your operating system in uh in apple you can do a search uh
7:44:55
almost on the uh the desktop through the spotlight search and it will bring up search results
7:45:01
if you go through that uh it's using basically the search engine capability
7:45:07
built into the operating system but it doesn't get reported as a search engine referral instead what's happening is
7:45:14
it's sending you to that site as a direct traffic so anything that's from an operating system a search that comes
7:45:22
through an app now if you're using the Google app this is kind of a a kind of a
7:45:28
gray area um but it does happen so you basically
7:45:34
have to install the Google Search app or use something in the browser but if
7:45:39
you're in an app with a search function and that app is not a search engine app
7:45:45
it will show up as direct traffic uh your voice based searches that's using
7:45:50
the operating system uh now you can use a voice based search in the Google
7:45:56
Search app and that will show up as a search referral I know this might get a
7:46:03
little confusing uh but this also is you know this is sort of the dark search of
7:46:09
what's going on uh and then also Amazon like I said is stealing a lot of
7:46:14
business away from Google uh but there's no way to really know what your Amazon ranking is for a
7:46:21
specific product or query uh so in that way you're kind of losing some of
7:46:27
whatever Amazon is taking we're also losing some of that data so those are some of the obstacles that
7:46:34
we're running into in terms of getting a big picture of campaign metrics
7:46:41
so like I said we need to start with a business goal when we start developing campaign
7:46:47
metrics this is where the expectations need to be very very clear uh and I kind
7:46:55
of like the acronym of clear here that we need to clearly State what is the business purpose what are we trying to
7:47:03
ultimately accomplish and how will search help to accomplish that
7:47:09
based on that we create a set of goals we lay out the goals of a campaign what
7:47:15
do we want people to do and then carry that over into how does that accomplish
7:47:21
the purpose we then explain how and define success
7:47:27
explain how success is accomplished as people meet those goals how does that
7:47:32
fit into the customer Journey where is that in the customer Journey how does it move them from one stage to the next how
7:47:40
do we measure that and how do we Define that as success then we align metrics to
7:47:47
that strategy we don't just start with the metrics we start with the purpose
7:47:53
the goal defining success and then aligning metrics as we have our strategy
7:48:00
and then the final stage is the ideal customer experience how do we relate that through these metrics how do we
7:48:07
explain that our customer has seen this and then they did this or they looked
7:48:13
for this information and it was a successful visit now what will they need this is where we look at the overall
7:48:20
customer journey and how search is a part of that Journey
7:48:26
now getting into some very specific metrics that will assist this one of the
7:48:32
things that I like to look at and this can be a part of the reporting if I'm
7:48:38
looking at just the cold hard facts of of SEO campaign metrics one of the first
7:48:44
things I'm going to look at is that audience overview and I'm going to look specifically at my organic traffic now
7:48:53
one of the things I need to caution is making sure and I'm I'm surprised I
7:48:59
still have to say this is comparing like time frames you can compare year over
7:49:04
year if you're comparing the entire year quarter to quarter example is I'm
7:49:10
looking at first quarter 2017 compared to first quarter 2016. I want to compare
7:49:17
like time frames I am amazed at how many businesses still look at month to month
7:49:23
to month to month and there is such a drastic difference between month to month you have to compare this quarter
7:49:31
to the same quarter last year this month this year to let that you have to compare the like time frames going month
7:49:38
to month is is a is chasing your tail so from here I want to specifically just
7:49:45
look at my organic coverage at this point what I'm looking at here is with
7:49:50
the audience overview I'm looking at my total number of sessions this year compared to last year and I can see that
7:49:58
it's higher uh and in some areas I've seen some dips uh but then when I went
7:50:04
to go look at specifically in Google this year or this first quarter compared to first quarter last year where am I at
7:50:11
in terms of sessions new users bounce rate conversion rate and transactions
7:50:19
that's what's going to help me as far as getting the first step in my SEO metrics
7:50:29
the next is looking at total organic visits this is anything that comes
7:50:35
through search now again this is part of the conversation this is everything we can track uh because there are things
7:50:42
that are completely outside of this uh this might be a good time to say this I
7:50:48
was talking to an analytics provider a couple of years ago and in comparing
7:50:53
different analytics systems and I asked them what makes your analytics more
7:50:59
accurate than your competitors it was very interesting because this is the
7:51:04
lead engineer and he sort of shushed me this was on the trade show floor and he says in analytics we don't talk about
7:51:12
accuracy he says what I like to say is that our
7:51:17
analytics are less inaccurate than our class than our competitors
7:51:23
and that is really the case when it comes to analytics if you've ever
7:51:28
compared analytics from two different systems and looking at the same metrics
7:51:33
they never agree I'm always amazed at how many people try to make their Google analytics line up
7:51:40
with their omniture analytics and it will never happen or they'll look at multiple different packages or they'll
7:51:47
tell me my agency is reporting these numbers but these numbers are what I'm seeing and they're using two different systems that's because
7:51:55
Analytics it's tracking what it can track and what is unclear an algorithm
7:52:02
tries to organize it or an algorithm tries to assign things that are unclear to
7:52:09
different areas so each analytics program kind of has its own methodology
7:52:14
of organizing the information and interpreting it based on that that's
7:52:20
where you come up with the we're less inaccurate than our competitors so when we're measuring organic coverage we're
7:52:27
measuring what we can based on this system it may not agree with another
7:52:32
system don't try to make it agree because it just simply won't now here I'm looking at my total organic
7:52:40
search visits and I can see compared to the the year prior this quarter is up 18
7:52:48
in visits I can look at total conversions and I can see that it's up
7:52:54
30 percent uh and then also what I want to do is look at landing pages and my
7:53:01
keyword Concepts now this is a sense because the search engines don't provide
7:53:07
us any keyword data what we can do is look at our landing pages and the amount
7:53:15
of visits those landing pages are generating then it doesn't take much to kind of
7:53:22
look at those landing pages and see what what are they basically about what are those keyword Concepts now you can go to
7:53:30
uh Google search console you can go to Bing webmaster tools and you can see
7:53:36
which keywords uh are driving traffic to your business through those webmaster
7:53:43
portals and you can get the concept of what keywords uh are driving traffic now
7:53:50
one thing I do like about Bing webmaster tools is that Bing webmaster tools will not only show me which keywords I'm
7:53:57
ranking for and which ones are sending traffic to my website but they will also show me which Pages or the recipients of
7:54:06
those keywords so they are able to tie together the keywords and the landing pages and so I'll do that in bing uh on
7:54:13
also Google search console will do that to an extent but to some degree this is still a
7:54:22
manual process of looking at my landing pages and comparing them to the keyword
7:54:28
Concepts as I said Google's trying to push everything together into intent and
7:54:33
so evaluate your landing pages in terms of intent what would someone be searching on in order to get to this
7:54:39
page and utilize Google search console and Bing webmaster tools maybe some of
7:54:45
your analytics in order to figure that out also what I like to look at are
7:54:51
comparative metrics when I'm looking at the success of an SEO campaign as tied to other types of
7:55:00
campaigns I also want to show the value of search engine optimization and what
7:55:05
it's providing and so in looking at a source medium I'm using Google analytics
7:55:11
here what I can do here is for this time frame look at the overall numbers of
7:55:17
sessions generated through each Channel as you can see there Google on its own
7:55:23
is about 67 percent of all visits Yahoo is providing about
7:55:28
[Music] 1.28 percent of visits and then we can see a little less than 20 percent are
7:55:36
direct visits so comparatively I can see where my search engine optimization is
7:55:43
contributing in comparison to all the other channels and I can get a sense
7:55:49
there into terms of I can run a revenue report by Source where I can see where
7:55:56
my search is responsible for the greatest amount of revenue for the greatest amount of orders uh and also
7:56:04
when I look at uh when the interesting thing here I can also do a value per session breakdown and what this shows me
7:56:11
is uh the email campaigns those by far have the highest value per session
7:56:18
visitors coming through the blog are next in value per session and then we
7:56:24
can see our search visitors showing up there as a significantly high value per
7:56:29
session um and one thing you might uh jump out to you there is you can see that Bing has a
7:56:36
four pound 27 value per session compared to Google with a one pound 77 that's
7:56:42
normal I over the past 15 years it has been a really interesting phenomenon
7:56:50
that visitors from Bing or MSN have a higher value even though I will get uh
7:56:58
just sheer numbers and higher revenue from Google but they are higher value visitor uh than Google visitors uh
7:57:07
that's just a phenomenon that we've just observed for more than about 15 years and really kind of interesting there uh
7:57:14
so from a metric standpoint I like doing comparative metrics to see here's how
7:57:19
search compares to your other channels here's what it's driving compared to your other channels in terms of visitors
7:57:24
in terms of Engagement in terms of Revenue and revenue per user
7:57:31
uh and again I I kind of mentioned this associative metrics using Google search console uh to see some of the keywords
7:57:38
that Google is driving uh Google my business I'm going to show that uh as we get into here before we wrap up Bing
7:57:46
webmaster tools as I said they will show you the keywords as well as the associated landing pages analytics uh
7:57:53
getting into analytics and looking at your organic traffic I showed you a few reports there uh but that is where
7:58:00
people need to live in order to understand what's going on with their search traffic and more and more
7:58:07
um alongside analytics I'm seeing a CRM integration with analytics really
7:58:13
becoming a a different standard because within the CRM integration I can then
7:58:19
look at the entire customer journey I can track the initial touch point of a
7:58:25
consumer I can then see how that spreads into different searches so maybe they'll
7:58:31
find me first from a paid ad but then how does a subsequent organic searches
7:58:36
contribute to different touch points and then maybe there is a retargeting touch
7:58:43
Point uh and so I really like what I'm seeing with modern CRM systems and
7:58:50
tracking more of the customer journey and how search is a part of it and that
7:58:56
really then gets to the point of looking at that customer Journey that ideal
7:59:01
customer experience and it immediately puts it in the context of the purpose of
7:59:07
the campaign uh and the goals of the campaign focused around the user experience
7:59:13
when I'm talking with a client laying out expectations really my first question is what makes you money because
7:59:20
that's what we want to track there's our purpose we want to look at sales and leads and so I want to look at this
7:59:27
prioritized outcomes this gets back to what is the purpose of the overall campaign
7:59:33
then we need to look at what are performance goals now not all of these
7:59:38
goals carry the same amount of weight what I mean by that are inquiries support uh
7:59:47
people viewing videos online chat subscribes downloads those are all a
7:59:53
different level of Engagement than a typical like or retweet or a pin
7:59:58
um that's what I call you know it these are much more active if someone makes an inquiry that's a lead if they
8:00:05
contact support if they're viewing videos about new cars that's a
8:00:10
performance goal that means I'm engaging somebody and I'm answering their questions uh we can look at people
8:00:16
subscribing and asking for more information downloading brochures downloading information this is where
8:00:22
we'll attach different value to different actions because some actions will contribute much more in terms of
8:00:30
value in the customer experience than others and so we want to look at the performance goals and establish a level
SEO KPIs
8:00:36
of value around them and then explain clearly the difference
8:00:42
between a performance goal and a performance indicator performance indicators visibility visits
8:00:49
time on site Pages viewed bounce rate these are all good performance indicators but they are removed from a
8:00:57
direct impact on the business goals it's an indirect factor in fact they can even
8:01:02
be misleading if that's what you're using because you can see that business goals are excelling while these numbers
8:01:10
might go down or they might go up and business goals go down because it's what are you doing with the information and
8:01:16
how are you focusing your efforts I want to focus uh real quickly before I
8:01:23
wrap up here on uh Google my business and this is something that uh Google has
8:01:30
done more and more of I'm using actually a local landscaper that I've been helping out simply because I love the
8:01:36
numbers that are showing up on this um and it's really cool because you just
8:01:42
put your business in and then you set the service area so it can be a zip code it can be a radius uh and then you can
8:01:50
view the insights this is just on the left side is the login panel and it will
8:01:56
show you how many searches your business has shown up for in the past month as we
8:02:03
can see here we're over we're almost at about six and a half thousand searches
8:02:09
where people searched for uh their business we
8:02:14
we can see about 8.3 000 views of their local listing and
8:02:22
about uh 16 000 actions uh so we can see here this
8:02:29
now this probably right here is probably going to be I think the future of SEO
8:02:36
metrics the main reason is this is what happens when you do a search for a local
8:02:41
business and the business box shows up in the results and that business box as
8:02:47
a picture of the business a description hours uh pictures
8:02:52
and phone number and what can happen here just like with the information
8:02:57
where Google is showing all the information and you don't even have to click through it this is tracking that type of visibility
8:03:05
this is showing you how many times simply your business information showed
8:03:12
in the search results and so now from here we can look specifically on uh what
8:03:19
customers how they viewed your business and we can see how many times the business showed up in Search and how
8:03:26
many times it showed up on maps in the top graph in the lower graph and this is where I think this is I I think this
8:03:34
where reporting is really going to be moving is from that business box in the
8:03:39
search results we're now showing in the past month how many total actions people have taken and
8:03:47
that is how many people visited the website from the the inbox information box how many people requested directions
8:03:54
and how many people called from that business listing and the far right graph
8:04:00
shows you how many people uh the dark green so maybe a little over a fourth of
8:04:06
people were looking for the specific business name a little more than or a little less than
8:04:14
three quarters of people we're looking for related keywords and because of that
8:04:19
saw the business information so from a visibility metric standpoint
8:04:25
within Google search results I love what Google my business is doing because it's
8:04:31
providing me a view of how many people are seeing my listing without even
8:04:37
clicking on it but then because of the interactions available through smartphone searches local searches map
8:04:45
based searches I can track a lot of this local activity and how people are then
8:04:51
integrating uh or engaging with my local
8:04:56
search results on google.com uh so reporting has changed it will
8:05:04
continue to do so that is the only uh that is the only hard and fast rule here
8:05:09
uh and so metrics need to focus on uh emphasizing conversion rates optimizing
8:05:16
landing pages and it requires analytics expertise much more than ever and
8:05:22
ultimately what we want to get to is a measurement of the user experience like I said that big picture of the user
8:05:29
experience did they find what they wanted uh doing task-based user testing
8:05:35
where they have to find a specific bit of information uh from the search to the
8:05:41
site and from that you can gather an understanding of how quickly they're able to find it how they can navigate
8:05:47
there both in a desktop and a mobile and this gets to the the micro moment
8:05:53
assessment when people are searching for things such as can I afford it uh show
8:05:59
me the new cars where can I get Finance those types of
8:06:04
micro moment questions that people type into the search box or speak into their
8:06:09
phone okay I'm going to start out with how to set up a Google analytics account
Google Analytics - How to Setup Google Analytics Account
8:06:15
and so we're going to talk about everything that entails including creating your Google analytics account
8:06:20
we're going to talk about setting up a property in your account and what a property is we're going to talk about
8:06:27
setting up a reporting view in your property and we're going to talk about installing the tracking code so those
8:06:33
are the series of steps we're going to go through today in terms of setting up
8:06:38
a Google analytics account so let's get right to it and so really the Bruin prerequisite here when it comes to
8:06:46
setting up a Google analytics account is to have a Google login and ID so when
8:06:52
you actually go to Google analytics you need to be able to sign up or sign in
8:06:57
and so once you actually sign in then you're gonna go walk through a series of
8:07:03
steps but really that's really all you need to get the account going is a
8:07:09
Google ID and login so if you have a Gmail account or an other email account
8:07:15
that you use for other Google products then you're good to go that's all you need to do so when you actually go to
8:07:21
sign up for Google analytics you're going to be asked to set up a new account and these are the series of
8:07:29
steps you're going to walk through or go through to set up a new Google Analytics account so you're going to choose an
8:07:35
account name and then you're going to choose a property name okay so the account name can be anything you want it
8:07:40
to be the name your company your name whatever you want to name it the property name is really the website name
8:07:48
so what website are we talking about so here I'm going to set up a fictitious website name for now it's called demo
8:07:55
simply learn so the URL for this website demo simply learn is going to be
8:08:02
demo.simplylearn.com so that's the property when we talk about properties and analytics we're really talking about
8:08:08
what websites we want to measure and then you're going to be asked to choose an industry category and so for simply
8:08:15
learn we're in jobs and education but you have a number of different industries that you could choose from
8:08:21
it's as important go ahead and choose the most relevant industry that your
8:08:27
particular business is associated with okay and I'm going to talk about why that's important here in a minute and then you're going to choose your time
8:08:33
zone and the time zone is also important because that's when the day starts in
8:08:39
analytics and the day ends based on that time zone so the data that Google analytics collects starts and ends with
8:08:47
that time zone so very important to choose the time zone your business is located in okay and then you have some
8:08:54
additional options here okay so you have some settings and so the first setting is to allow Google products and services
8:09:02
so if you opt into this then basically what Google's going to do is share some
8:09:08
products and services with you via email I would go ahead and opt into that that's of course recommended by Google
8:09:15
it doesn't hurt to hear from Google on related products and services that may
8:09:20
enhance your business the second is benchmarking so benchmarking to me is
8:09:25
something you should opt into so going back to that industry and category we
8:09:30
chose jobs and education so by opting into benchmarking basically what
8:09:35
Google's going to do is share your data that it collects on your website in this
8:09:41
case demo.simplylearn.com it's going to share that data anonymously with others in the
8:09:49
industry in this case jobs and education and because you've opted in it's going
8:09:55
to do the same exact thing for you it's going to share Anonymous data on other
8:10:01
websites in the same industry and the benefit of that is we get to see what
8:10:07
other websites or how other websites are performing compared to ours what's the Benchmark in our industry and so the
8:10:14
benchmarking to me is important and I'm gonna go over that in a few minutes when we go over the different reports but to
8:10:20
me I would always opt into benchmarking because this is the only report Google provides in analytics about how others
8:10:29
in your industry is performing versus your website okay so it's a way to compare your website performance against
8:10:35
others in the same industry the other options here technical support and account specialist I would also
8:10:42
recommend you opt into those because then it allows you to basically Google
8:10:48
allow Google access to your account and they'll be able to help you if you occur
8:10:53
or run into any issues so these are the options in setting up a Google analytics account it's very simple very easy easy
8:11:01
to do you're just entering in a few Fields note that we talking about a
8:11:06
website right now so I'm talking about demo.simplylearn.com but just know that if you want to track a mobile app Google
8:11:13
analytics will allow you to do that as well you just choose the option mobile app so we're tracking a website we want
8:11:19
to know how users behave when they get to my website and that's what Google analytics is going to allow us to
8:11:26
measure and look at we just need to do a couple more steps in the process so once
8:11:31
we fill out these fields here we're going to click get tracking ID now I'm going to accept the terms of service I'm
8:11:38
going to accept another terms and service in relation to data protection
8:11:43
I'm going to click accept once I accept I'm going to be able to get some tracking code the tracking ID is the ID
8:11:52
associated with your account and so this number is going to be associated with
8:11:59
your account so your account I ID starts with UA and it's going to be this number
8:12:04
here now the dash one is the property you set up so in this case I set up
8:12:11
demo.simplylearn.com if I wanted to track multiple websites under that same
8:12:17
account then I can certainly set up multiple properties just know that every
8:12:22
property I set up in that account is going to have a dash 1-2-3-4
8:12:29
Etc depending on how many properties I set up so by default I set up one property so my first property ID is dash
8:12:38
one if I set up a second property the same account number it's just gonna have a dash two and that's important because
8:12:45
that ID that account and property ID is going to be associated with that
8:12:51
particular property or website so again once you finish setting up the account settings then you're going to be asked
8:12:58
to add some tracking code to your site and that tracking code is going to be related to the account and the property
8:13:05
so notice my tracking ID up here notice the tracking ID and the snippet of code
8:13:11
now this snip and a code needs to go on every page of your website that you want
8:13:17
to track and you don't have to put it on every page but if you want to track website behavior on every page or
8:13:24
website then it needs to go on every page of your website so if you're using a you know platform like Drupal or
8:13:32
Joomla or even more popular platform like WordPress adding the tracking code
8:13:37
site-wide is as easy as maybe adding a Google analytics plugin to Wordpress for
8:13:43
example and then just simply plug in in the ID now there's an alternative to adding the Google analytics tracking
8:13:50
code to your site and that's Google tag manager so Google tag manager is the way
8:13:56
I would recommend going so if you're not familiar with Google tag manager I would recomme man watching the YouTube video
8:14:04
we have on Google tag manager you can just go to YouTube Type in simply learn Google tag manager and this will give
8:14:11
you a nice overview of you know what Google tag manager is and how it works
8:14:16
but basically this is the way I would go and I would recommend that in addition
8:14:22
having Google analytics you set up a Google tag manager account and then that way you can put the tracking code in
8:14:29
Google tag manager so if I go to Google tag manager and I just go into an account on tag manager I can just simply
8:14:37
put in the Google analytics ID right into tag manager and so if I have it in
8:14:45
tag manager then tag manager is going to be the place that holds the code and
8:14:51
fires page view when somebody comes to my website so that way I don't have to add the tracking code to my website if I
8:14:58
do it in tag manager so that's the recommended method for me is to add the
8:15:04
Google analytics ID associate it with tag manager if you can associate it with tag manager then that's the easier route
8:15:12
to go versus putting code on your website okay so again take a look at the video we have on YouTube for Google tag
8:15:19
manager that's the route I would go now once you do get the tracking code on
8:15:24
your website whether that be through Google tag manager or through a plug-in or you know just simply adding the
8:15:31
script to your site to pages on your site then what's going to happen is you're going to start collecting data so
8:15:37
that's ideally the way it works you need to add this code to your website now if
8:15:43
you're not ready to do that and you simply want to basically understand how
8:15:49
Google analytics works then I would recommend getting access to Google analytics demo account and so if you
8:15:56
just type in and search Google analytics demo account basically okay what you're
8:16:01
going to do you're going to choose the first listing there and you're going to go to demo account so if you have a
8:16:08
Google analytics or Google login then all you need to do is click on access demo account and so what Google is going
8:16:15
to do is put this demo account into your account and so it's going to look something like this so if I click on
8:16:21
demo account here it's going to add to my Google analytics account so I'm going
8:16:26
to have then access to the demo account from Google in Google analytics so I
8:16:33
would recommend going this route here if you're not familiar you're not sure what
8:16:39
you're getting yourself into so think of the demo account as kind of a test drive you're test driving Google analytics
8:16:45
before you even add any code to your website so again all you need is a Google account and if you have a Google
8:16:51
account and you add the demo account to your Google analytics account you're going to be able to see how analytics
8:16:58
works okay and so that's what I I would also recommend so if you're not ready to start adding code to your website then
8:17:06
what you can do is just simply add the demo account and then once you add the demo account you're free to peruse
8:17:13
around Google analytics to see the different types reports it has to offer now when you do actually set up a Google
8:17:20
analytics account you're going to have some settings that you're going to want to pay attention to so when you set up
8:17:27
the account you have the account name and then you have a property so under each property you have by default you're
8:17:34
going to have one View and so here you can see this view here so if we look at the account we set up we set up a demo
8:17:41
simply learn account property is demo simply learn so that's associated with
8:17:46
the website we're going to track and then again by default under each property you're going to have a view and
8:17:53
so by default the name of the view is going to be called all website data and so in that view is where all your
8:18:00
Analytics data is going to be stored so you can see my screen here there's a lot
8:18:05
of different settings you have you have settings under the account you have settings under the property and you have
8:18:12
settings under the view so we're going to talk more about these settings and future webinars for advanced Google
8:18:19
analytics users but for now know that there's a bunch of settings that you have that you can play around with when
8:18:26
it comes to Google analytics anything from adding users to your Google analytics account your Google analytics
8:18:32
property or view you can actually set up goals you can set up filters you can set
8:18:37
up segments you can link up Google ads you can you know set up remarketing list
8:18:44
there's a lot you can do in terms of the settings as it relates to Google analytics but so know those settings are
8:18:51
there they're located right down here and this little sprocket icon that's the
8:18:56
admin icon so if you need to get to these settings at any time time you could simply just click on the sprocket
Google Analytics - Reports
8:19:03
or the admin icon and then you'll be prompted to choose any one of these
8:19:09
settings here that you want to edit or alter so now let's take a look at some Google analytics reports so once you've
8:19:16
actually set up your account you have a number of different reports that you have available to you in Google
8:19:22
analytics so we're going to take a look at you know customized reports we're going to look at real time audience
8:19:28
reports acquisition behavior and conversion so these are all the
8:19:33
different reporting buckets if you will that you have available to you in Google
8:19:38
analytics so if I'm in admin and I'm looking at the Google demo account let's
8:19:44
start out by looking at real time so if I click on the real time report and I
8:19:50
just click on overview so basically what this is going to do is show me at this
8:19:55
point in time how many users I actually have active on the website site okay so
8:20:01
that's why they call it real time reporting because it allows you to see the behavior of users who are currently
8:20:08
on your website and so this is the overview report under real time and you
8:20:13
can see here I can see that 79 percent of my users are coming from desktop 18
8:20:20
20 are coming from mobile and then approximately three percent are coming from tablet here I can see how they
8:20:27
actually came to the website so this is the referring Source if they came from
8:20:33
say search or social I can see the source there and I can see what pages
8:20:38
they're active on and then here I could see what locations where they're located and so if I want to see a breakdown of
8:20:44
everything in the overview I can certainly do that if I go to locations under real time I could see a majority
8:20:50
of my users are coming from the United States okay where are they coming from I'll just click on traffic sources and
8:20:58
here I could see the different source sources and mediums medium is the means
8:21:03
in which the traffic was driven so if it's Google it's either paid search or organic search so I can see here it's
8:21:10
organic then I can actually see what contents they're looking at on my website so I could see currently I have
8:21:17
three active users on the home page two active users on the Google's women's
8:21:22
white t page so forth and so on now most importantly if you have a vent tracking
8:21:29
set up so if you're taking a look at our Google tag manager webinar you know that
8:21:34
you could set up event tracking in Google analytics to measure engagement on your website whether that be a form
8:21:41
submission or somebody clicking on the play button of a video so if I click on events I'll be able to see what events
8:21:49
are firing so here I can see we have event tracking set up and I can see how
8:21:55
many different events are firing on my website in real time so here I can see econ Commerce somebody clicking on the
8:22:01
quick view click some a couple of users clicking on add to cart a couple of users clicking on the promotion click
8:22:08
and as these events are fired you're going to be able to see them highlighted so if something gets fired it's going to
8:22:15
get highlighted and I could see that these are the current events that I have
8:22:21
currently firing on the website and that's what's currently fire now if I want to look at the events that have
8:22:27
happened in the last 30 minutes I could just click on this link here last 30 minutes and it's going to give me an
8:22:33
overview of the events that have happened over the past 30 minutes okay so that's event tracking and then more
8:22:40
importantly we can also look at what conversions are happening in real time just by clicking on conversions and so
8:22:47
now I can see I had one active user who entered the checkout so that's goal
8:22:54
number four so in analytics you can have up to 20 goals and so here I can see we
8:22:59
have goal number four has already had one active user and so if I look at the last 30 minutes I can see I still have
8:23:06
only one goal over the last 30 minutes and that was somebody who entered the checkout so that's real time reporting
8:23:13
in summary it just gives you an idea of what's currently happening on your
8:23:19
website and so for me ideally if I'm launching a campaign or let's just say you do a new website redesign and you
8:23:26
want to see how users performing and behaving then real time is a good option for you so you could see how things are
8:23:33
happening in real time now let's jump down to audience reporting so if I click on audience this is just right
8:23:39
underneath real time I'm gonna see a number of different reports available to
8:23:45
me under audience and so let's click on the audience overview report so audience
8:23:52
reporting basically allows us to get a sense of who is coming to our website
8:23:58
when I say who is coming to our web website it doesn't necessarily have to be a specific person in fact Google
8:24:04
doesn't allow personally identifiable information in Google analytics personal
8:24:10
identifiable information such as a specific name uh social security number
8:24:15
credit card information Etc however we could still paint a nice
8:24:22
picture on who is coming to our website meaning what country city or state did
8:24:28
they come from what language what device do they get to our website from how old
8:24:33
were they okay were they male or female or other what interest do they have what
8:24:39
browser do they use so we can paint a nice picture based on all this information that Google analytics is
8:24:46
providing us under audience so if I go to audience overview here I can see I
8:24:51
have all these different options available to me to get a basic understanding of who is coming to our
8:24:57
website so for example I could see a majority of the people coming to our
8:25:03
website speak English and are from the United States okay in fact that represents 61 of the users and so Google
8:25:11
analytics does a great job of giving me an overall percentage so if I have a
8:25:17
hundred percent of the users I could see 61 percent of those users represented English-speaking users from the United
8:25:24
States seven percent represented English-speaking users from Great Britain and so when it comes to
8:25:31
analytics we have users and users are broken down into two categories they're
8:25:37
either returning or they're new so when you add the Google analytics tracking
8:25:42
script to your website what's gonna happen is if a user or when a user goes to your website they're gonna get
8:25:48
cookied if it's the first time they've been to your website what Google analytics is going to do is store a
8:25:54
cookie in the browser so when that same user comes back another day in the same
8:25:59
browser analytics is going to recognize that that cookie is in the browser and
8:26:05
so then analytics is going to categorize that user as a returning user okay so
8:26:10
that's how analytics is able to differentiate new versus returning so if that user doesn't have a cookie in the
8:26:17
browser then analytics is going to recognize that store the cookie and then count that user as a new user and so
8:26:24
when you're looking in analytics you're going to be able to see a breakdown of new versus returning so here I can see
8:26:30
over three quarters of my traffic over the past week here I can see April 6
8:26:36
through April 12th three over three quarters are new users to the website
8:26:41
here I could see about 23 24 are returning users okay so I can get a good
8:26:48
breakdown of what type of users are coming am I driving new traffic am I
8:26:54
driving traffic that's been to my website before what language are they speaking okay I can also paint a bigger
8:27:00
picture how old are they are they what gender are they do they come from mobile so let's take a look at some of these
8:27:07
different reports under audience and so if I skip down now to demographics I can
8:27:12
click on overview and when that report loads I can see now under demographics
8:27:18
overview I can see the breakout of age ranges and so here I can see the
8:27:25
majority of the traffic coming to my site again over the past week now if I want to change this date range I could
8:27:31
simply do that I can change the date range just by clicking on the date range and then maybe going say the last 30
8:27:37
days and I can even compare it to the previous period or the previous year I'm
8:27:43
going to choose the last 30 days I'm going to click apply now I'm looking at data over the last 30 days and again you
8:27:51
can change the date range to any range you want you can only go back as far as when you actually created the Google
8:27:57
analytics account you can't go prior to that so here I'm looking at the last 30
8:28:03
days and I can see almost 47 percent of my users were in their age range of 25
8:28:10
to 34. now when it comes to gender I can say 66 percent represent males so I can
8:28:19
get a breakout of gender and age as well as interest I can click on interest and
8:28:25
look at the overview there and see what the interest is of the users who are
8:28:31
coming to my site based on in-market segments or Affinity I can also choose
8:28:36
language and location so if I want to know exactly where my users are located
8:28:41
when they're coming to my website I can click on location and here I can get a breakout 43 of the users of the last 30
8:28:50
days were from the United States more importantly I can align my audience with
8:28:57
goals and we'll talk about goals here in a minute but he here I can see if I have an e-commerce website I can see of those
8:29:04
43 percent 0.29 of those converted or purchased something and that equates to
8:29:11
94 transactions so I can get a good sense of not only how many users are
8:29:16
coming from a specific country but are those users converting if I click on
8:29:21
mobile and mobile to me is one of those reports I tend to spend a bit of time on
8:29:27
because I want to know what devices users are coming to my website and so
8:29:33
for my website here or this is the Google demo website I can see mobile
8:29:38
represents approximately 27 of the traffic so desktop still represents a
8:29:45
majority of the traffic so for you you want to keep an eye on mobile because
8:29:50
mobile is definitely a majority of what people use nowadays that's how people
8:29:55
start their day that's how they transact Via mobile whether that's purchasing
8:30:01
something communicating or searching it all starts with mobile so you want to keep an eye on mobile and more
8:30:08
importantly you want to keep an eye on Behavior so Google analytics is telling me that yes I have approximately 27 of
8:30:16
my traffic of the last 30 days came from mobile how are they interacting with my
8:30:21
website so if I look across this report I'm going to be able to see different
8:30:27
metrics so if I'm measuring specific metrics against my dimension in this
8:30:34
case the dimension is what we're measuring and in this example we're measuring mobile I can see that the
8:30:41
bounce rate is approximately 48 percent and bounce rate means that if a user in
8:30:47
this case for mobile landed on a page they left the site without going any
8:30:53
further so they consider it a bounce if they don't go to another page if they
8:30:58
leave the site from the page they landed on and they don't go any further that's considered a bounce so bounce rate is
8:31:05
the percentage of people who come to the site and leave the site without going any further so in this case we have 48
8:31:13
bounce rate that's almost half of our users who come from mobile leave the website from the page they landed on so
8:31:21
is that good is that bad well it's open to interpretation is definitely
8:31:26
subjective but you want to keep the bounce rate as low as possible you want to keep people on your site especially
8:31:33
if you have an e-commerce website you want people who come to your website to
8:31:39
purchase and so here we can see 48 mobile and desktop it's a little bit
8:31:45
lower at 41 percent now if I look a little bit further at engagement I can
8:31:50
see how many pages on average do mobile users look at so versus desktop it's a
8:31:57
little bit lower you can see 3.86 on desktop it's 4.5 now if I look a little
8:32:03
bit further in engagement I want to be able to measure how long somebody from
8:32:08
mobile stays on the website if they're bouncing at 48 but they're also looking
8:32:14
at 3.8 Pages 3.9 almost four pages per session then that means in this report
8:32:20
analytics is telling me they're spending about two minutes on the site and interestingly enough I can see that
8:32:27
mobile of the last 30 days had more transactions so 51 transactions versus
8:32:34
34 transactions from desktop and interestingly enough the e-commerce
8:32:40
conversion rate is at 0.29 percent that's higher than desktop at .07 it's
8:32:46
lower than tablet but it's higher than desktop and mobile has the most transactions and since they have the
8:32:53
most transactions they have the most Revenue at 2 380. so yes the engagement
8:32:59
it isn't exactly as great as it is as desktop but we can see that people are
8:33:04
still purchasing with their mobile devices so it's something to keep an eye on and mobile is something I definitely
8:33:11
look at in fact since it's such an important report one thing you can do in
8:33:16
analytics is if you actually like a report and you think you're going to look at that report multiple times then
8:33:23
you can simply just go ahead and click save at the top here so if I click save
8:33:28
I'm going to enter a name for this report I'm just going to call it mobile report and click OK and then what's
8:33:35
going to happen is it's going to be located under save reports and save reports is located under customization
8:33:43
customization is located above real time okay so if I close that up you can see audience real time customization if I
8:33:51
click on customization if I click on Save reports I should be able to see my
8:33:57
save report here and I do so here I can see a mobile report if I click on it I
8:34:03
can simply go to the report I was looking at before I saved it so save reports to me is a good feature and
8:34:08
analytics because it allows you to quickly access a report that you've
8:34:13
saved in the past so let's take a look at one more report under audience and let's go to benchmarking so remember
8:34:20
when we were setting up our analytics account we had the option to opt into
8:34:25
benchmarking and I recommended you do so and so if you did I actually opt into
8:34:31
benchmarking then you're going to be able to see how your site compares to
8:34:37
others in the same industry so if I click on benchmarking and then click on channels what I'm actually able to do
8:34:43
now is compare my website with others in the same industry so if I go back to say
8:34:50
jobs in education and I choose education all education as my industry vertical I
8:34:57
should be able to see website sites that are in the same particular industry and
8:35:03
how I compare with those websites so I'm choosing all countries I can narrow that down if I wanted to I can just search
8:35:10
for the United States I can choose a specific State and then I can choose a
8:35:16
particular site size so here I'm choosing sites by daily session so these
8:35:21
are sites that have an average of 5 000 to almost 10 000 sessions a day and so
8:35:28
in this vertical education in the United States sites that have five thousand to
8:35:34
9999 sessions per day that means that they're approximately 310 web properties
8:35:41
contributing to this report okay based on this criteria I chose now if my site
8:35:46
is similar meaning if I'm in the United States if I'm in education and I'm receiving 5 000 to 9 999 sessions per
8:35:55
day then I'm able to compare my site against 310 other websites now Google's
8:36:02
sharing this data anonymously from the other websites and they're doing the same with your website to those
8:36:09
particular websites benchmarking reports okay so it's a shared data anonymously
8:36:15
in particular Industries and verticals and so now I'm looking at a channel
8:36:20
report so if I want to see how I compare to others in my industry then I can go
8:36:27
ahead and see by channel for example in my driving as much traffic as others in
8:36:33
my industry and you can see I'm not in fact I'm 76 77 percent worse in terms of
8:36:40
the amount of traffic being driven from organic search so anything in red is
8:36:46
going to show as a negative result a negative comparison whereas something in
8:36:51
green is a positive comparison so if I look at engagement I can see that I
8:36:57
might not be driving as much traffic but I can see that the pages per session are
8:37:03
better than the site average or the industry average I can see if I go over again looking just at organic search I
8:37:09
can see the bounce rate is better than the industry average so the channel report under benchmarking allows you to
8:37:17
measure how you compare to others in your industry and you could do so by looking at location and devices so if
8:37:24
you opted into benchmarking when you set up your account then you'll be able to
8:37:30
compare your website against others in your industry in your country region and
8:37:35
based on the size of your website in terms of how many visitors or sessions you're getting per day so let's go from
8:37:42
audience to acquisition so if audience is who is coming to your website acquisition allows us to see how the
8:37:50
traffic was driven to your website so how do these users get to our website and so under acquisition if we click on
8:37:57
overview we'll be able to to see an overview of how users whether they're
8:38:03
returning are new came to our website and so what analytics does by default is
8:38:09
they have a number of default channels and when we say channels we mean analytics is grouping different channels
8:38:17
based on how users got to your website meaning how did users get to our website did they come via organic search meaning
8:38:24
do they type something into Google and find you in the organic listing
8:38:30
analytics also groups users based on whether they came to your site directly meaning did they type in the URL
8:38:37
directly into the browser or did they bookmark your website and come back via
8:38:42
the bookmark so they're grouping users under direct they also group users under
8:38:48
referral meaning do they come from another website they group users by social do they come from a social media
8:38:55
platform like Twitter or Facebook if you're running paid search search meaning if you're running paid search on
8:39:02
say Google then do they come from Paid search ads now if you're running display ads on say Google's Network Google's
8:39:09
Display Network that's a default channel so analytics for group users there so if
8:39:14
they don't recognize a channel then they're going to group it as others so by default Google analytics groups users
8:39:20
and how they came to your website via these default channels and so I can see
8:39:26
how many users came to the site from each Channel now if I want to drill down
8:39:32
on this report I can click on all traffic and then if I click on all traffic I can go to channels I can look
8:39:38
specifically at the channels report and so now I can see organic search again
8:39:44
over the last 30 days is the number one channel driving traffic and they
8:39:50
represent approximately again you can see this number here in parentheses next to the raw number of users I can see
8:39:57
that number is about 56 cents so 56 percent of my traffic over the last 30
8:40:04
days came from organic search and so those are the number of users again as a
8:40:09
metric you're also going to have sessions and you'll see sessions a lot as a metric so users are broken down
8:40:16
between new and returning so every time a new or returning user comes to the
8:40:22
website basically what they're doing is initiating a session so you can have a
8:40:27
user who can come back multiple times every time they come back to the website it's a session so session is simply the
8:40:36
start of somebody coming to your website and the session ends when they leave the website and so just like we looked at
8:40:43
with the audience reports when it came to mobile we can also look at engagement
8:40:50
by channel so just like mobile we looked at bounce rate pages per session average
8:40:55
session duration we can do the same thing here with our our Channel report more importantly in addition to behavior
8:41:04
we can see conversions and since we're running an e-commerce platform we could see what the conversion rate is by
8:41:11
channel so organic search did drive the most traffic and they did have the most
8:41:17
transactions over the last 30 days and the conversion rate in this case is 0.17
8:41:23
okay so how Google determines the conversion rate they basically take the
8:41:28
number of transactions and divide that by sessions so that means that over the
8:41:33
last 30 days organic search drove 38 123 sessions and of those 38 000 123 64
8:41:42
actually turned into a transaction which equates to 0.17 which also equates to 3
8:41:49
000 in Revenue so I'm able to determine not only how users are getting to my
8:41:55
website by looking at the channel report I can actually see if they're in engaging and if they are converting and
8:42:03
notice when you look at a report in analytics you can look at it by Channel you'll also get a summary so here I can
8:42:10
see a summary or a total based on my date range so I could see over the last
8:42:15
30 days I've had 54 000 users 49 000 of them were new okay that meant
8:42:24
that out of this for 54 000 users I had 70 000 sessions I could see my average
8:42:30
bounce rate was 43 percent the pages per session were just over four and the
8:42:35
average session duration how long did somebody stay on my website on average about two minutes and 55 seconds the
8:42:42
average conversion rate was 0.14 and I had a total of 97 transactions totaling
8:42:48
fifty five hundred dollars okay and that's all over the last 30 days so any
8:42:54
report you look at in analytics is going to have a summary and note that any report you look at analytics is going to
8:43:01
allow you to save it so if it's a report you think you're going to go back and look at at a future date then you simply
8:43:08
just have to click on the save button conversely if you don't want to save it you can simply just export it so you can
8:43:15
export it as a PDF if I click on PDF it's going to allow me to export that as
8:43:21
a PDF now you have other options available to you as well you can do a Google sheet you can export it as an
8:43:28
Excel or you can export it as a comment delimited file so here you can see I can
8:43:34
save it as a PDF if I want to and if I click OK it's going to save to my
8:43:39
desktop or location of my choosing and then I can go back and look at it in that format at a later time so that's
8:43:45
the export feature available to you in analytics again if you you could save it
8:43:51
as well or you can export it okay some other reports under acquisition if you're running Google ads note that you
8:43:59
can to connect Google ads to analytics and this is key because now I can see
8:44:04
how many people are coming from Google ads to my website and are they
8:44:10
converting now this is important because with Google ads I'm actually paying for the click so you can see here I'm
8:44:17
running a report based on campaign data so I could see what campaigns are
8:44:22
driving traffic how much I'm paying per click and you can see on average I'm
8:44:27
paying 34 cents per click and then more importantly I want to be able to see if
8:44:33
they're converting so you can see I've spent 810 dollars over the last 30 days
8:44:38
and received 858 dollars in Revenue so you want to make sure that you link up
8:44:46
your Google ads account to your Google analytics account for this very reason
8:44:51
you want to be able to see how your Google ads campaigns perform once the
8:44:56
users get to your website and so I want to see if there engaging and I want to see if they're converting so they're all
8:45:03
sorts of reports under Google ads so you can look at it by keywords by search
8:45:08
queries by hour of the day if you're running display campaigns you can look at display targeting it says all sorts
8:45:16
of reports under Google ads you just have to link it up and you link it up under the admin now there are other
8:45:23
reports that you can look at so if I go to campaigns I can look at all campaigns
8:45:28
so if you're running all sorts of different types of campaigns whether that be on Facebook whether it be email
8:45:35
whether that be you know other types of advertising let's just say Twitter or
8:45:41
Instagram you're going to be able to see those campaigns here and that's under all campaigns and again you'll be able
8:45:47
to see the campaign name and you'll be able to see metrics associated with those campaigns and more importantly
8:45:53
you'll be able to see your e-commerce if you're running e-commerce platform or if you have goals set up so you'll be able
8:46:00
to look at how your campaigns are not one not only driving traffic but two are
8:46:06
they converting let's go from acquisition reporting to behavior so Behavior reports are going to actually
8:46:13
show you how users behaved once they got
8:46:19
to your website once they landed on a page on your website how did they behave so when we looked at audience we got a
8:46:26
sense of who is coming with acquisition we get a sense of how the traffic got to
8:46:31
our website did they come from organic direct social Etc the behavior reports
8:46:37
allow us to actually measure how that traffic behaved once they landed on a
8:46:42
page on our website and so if I go to overview under Behavior now I'm looking at this graph here it's showing me how
8:46:49
many pages I've had and a page view is simply once a page is viewed it's counted as a page view so if a user
8:46:56
comes to my site they're initiating a session and if they look at a page then that page is going to have a page view
8:47:04
okay so a user can look at a page multiple times in a session and every
8:47:09
time they look at that page it's going to count as a page view so here I can see in this graph how many pages I've
8:47:16
had again over the last 30 days and if I look further at my overview report I can
8:47:23
see the specific pages and how many pages they've had and I can also look at
8:47:28
some other metrics okay the average bounce rate the average time on page I
8:47:33
can look at the exit rate which means how many people actually exited or the
8:47:38
percentage of people who exited from that page so I can dig deeper into my
8:47:44
behavior reporting so if I click on site content and I click on all pages then
8:47:49
I'm going to look at a report by Page this is my Dimension this is what I'm measuring my page and now I can see how
8:47:56
many page views each page had of the last 30 days now note you also have
8:48:02
something called unique page views so unique page use is equivalent to one per
8:48:07
session in other words if a user came to my site and looked at the home page then
8:48:12
the home page is going to have one unique page view and one page view now if the user in that same session looks
8:48:20
at other Pages then every page that user looks at it's going to have one unique page view however if the user goes back
8:48:28
to another to the same page in the same session then it's still going to be one
8:48:33
unique page view but in this case the home page if they look at the home page a second time then the home page is
8:48:39
going to have two page views if they look at the home page five times in one session then the home page is gonna have
8:48:45
five total page views and one unique page view okay so that's why unique pages is equivalent to one per session
8:48:53
where pages is an accumulation of how many times the page was viewed in the
8:48:58
same session so in other words you're always going to have more page views than unique pages okay so this gives me
8:49:05
a sense of how my page is performed so again I can look at total page views and
8:49:11
then engagement so ideally what you want to do with a report like this is if a
8:49:17
user is not engaging on the page then that should tell you something about the page itself if they're not engaging if
8:49:23
the bounce rate's high if the time on page is low if the exit percentage of exit rate is high then you probably want
8:49:31
to do something with that page now these are all pages but if I jump down to
8:49:36
landing pages my landing page report is showing me how many people actually
8:49:41
landed on that page and so here I can see under my landing page report I can
8:49:47
see the home page had thirty six thousand 17 sessions in the last 30 days that's how many people landed on the
8:49:54
home page so here I can see 71 percent were news sessions meaning that I had a
8:50:01
lot of new users who landed on the home page in fact 25 000 or 52 percent of the people who
8:50:09
landed on the home page were new I could see the bounce rates about 42 percent but of those who didn't bounce they went
8:50:16
on to look at about 4.5 pages per session and spent about three minutes on
8:50:22
the site and the one thing I like about the landing page report is I can also
8:50:27
see whether that particular page in this case the home page did it help
8:50:33
contribute to a goal or conversion and in this case I can see of those 36 000
8:50:39
sessions I had 22 transactions totaling 1200 in revenue and that's an e-commerce
8:50:46
conversion rate of 0.06 percent so the home page over the last 30 days contributed to 0.06 percent of the
8:50:55
revenue so this gives you an idea of when somebody lands on your website and
8:51:00
they land on a page is that page helping to move that person along meaning are
8:51:07
they not bouncing and is that page helping to move people towards converting and so that's what the
8:51:13
landing page in effect allows us to measure is the engagement and in this case we're measuring transactions okay
8:51:20
so analytics also gives us some other reports under Behavior including site
8:51:26
speed so site speed to me is an important report to look at just like the mobile report to me site speed is
8:51:33
important because what Google analytics does is they take a sampling of pages
8:51:38
and in this case you can see over the last 30 days they sampled
8:51:43
2835 page views and of that sample they came back and said the average page load
8:51:50
time is about four seconds now ideally you want to keep it as quick as possible
8:51:56
I would say even under three seconds okay now there are other factors involved with page load time the browser
8:52:03
you're using the country that you're actually browsing that page from might know how to have the best infrastructure
8:52:10
you may not even be on the best internet Network meaning you're on a cell network
8:52:15
or the Wi-Fi is not that great or you can be on a page that just has a lot of images or a lot of code that may slow it
8:52:23
down so there are other factors involved and so what Google analytics does is show you what those factors are so here
8:52:29
I can see by browser with the average load time is if I want to look at Country I could see what country is
8:52:37
contributing to the load time now the great thing about the site speed report
8:52:42
is if I go to speed suggestions okay what speed suggestions is going to do is
8:52:48
it's going to show me the page load Time by Page and then it's actually going to
8:52:53
provide a link where I can actually click on to get suggestions on
8:52:59
increasing the page load time so for example I can look at this particular page here this Google redesign shop by
8:53:07
brand slash YouTube page line number five if I look at line number five I can see the average load time of this page
8:53:13
is eight seconds almost nine seconds okay that's an eternity to some people now notice this link next to it so
8:53:21
Google's recommending seven total suggestions so if I click on seven total what it's actually going to do it's
8:53:28
going to open up a new window and it's going to open up another Google report
8:53:33
called page speed insights and Page speed insights is going to give me some information about what I can do to
8:53:40
create correct correct the page load of that particular page so look at the site
8:53:47
speed report it's important because there is a correlation between site speed or page load time and user
8:53:54
behavior of that page and there's also correlation between page load time and a
8:54:00
page ranking organically on search so page load time is very important it's so
8:54:05
important that I'm even going to save it so I'm going to click save and click on speed site speed suggestions as my name
8:54:11
and click OK and now that report is going to be saved under customization under save reports let's jump from
8:54:19
Behavior to conversions now conversion reporting is arguably the most important
8:54:25
section in in Google analytics because what the conversions reporting allows us
8:54:31
to do is see how people are converting or if they're not converting on our
8:54:38
website and so in Google analytics we have the opportunity to set up goals now
8:54:43
you have the opportunity to set up 20 goals in your Google analytics View and
8:54:48
so to set up a goal okay so you're going to click on admin and Under The View you're going to see goals and so if you
8:54:55
don't even have goals the first step is to create goals and so you have four
8:55:01
different goal types in analytics so you have pages per session so how many pages
8:55:08
per session is so if your goal is set to say three or two if somebody actually looked at two or three pages per session
8:55:15
it's going to count as a goal okay so if I look here I could see I have pages per session set at 10. so that means that if
8:55:24
a user came to the site looked at more than 10 pages per session then it's going to count as a goal another goal
8:55:32
type is destination so destination means that if somebody actually went to a
8:55:38
specific page then it's going to count as a goal and in this case I can see
8:55:43
here that the goal is set to this particular page here and so when somebody actually lands on that page
8:55:50
it's going to count as a goal now there are two other goal ties we can look at one is duration so just like pages
8:55:58
question in our previous example is somebody looked at 10 pages per session it's going to count as a goal with
8:56:04
duration it's based on time so in this particular case if you set up a duration goal and the duration is set to say one
8:56:13
minute and 30 seconds then that means if a user comes to my website and they spend at least one minute and 30 seconds
8:56:20
then it's going to count as a goal okay and then the fourth type of goal in
8:56:25
Google analytics is an event based goal so when you set up event tracking you
8:56:31
could turn that event into a goal so if somebody clicks on say the submit button
8:56:37
of a form you can turn that event into a goal so here you can see the category
8:56:43
equals contact form so you can always verify if a goal works just by clicking
8:56:48
on verify this goal and in this case this event is turned into a goal so
8:56:54
anytime somebody fires this event it's gonna count as a goal so you have four
8:56:59
different goal types in Google analytics you have pages per session destination event and duration and so once you've
8:57:07
set up a goal then you can measure goals under conversions so now if I look at
8:57:13
goals overview I can be able to see how many total goal completions I've had so
8:57:18
if I want to look at it by goal I can just choose the goal option here so if I want to look at for example goal two
8:57:25
engaged users this was the pages per session I can see that I had a
8:57:31
conversion rate of 10 meaning that I had 7 000 of all the users that came to the
8:57:38
website 7 000 goal completions meaning 7106 users looked at 10 pages or more on
8:57:47
my website and so that's how you want to be able to measure whether users wherever they're coming from whoever
8:57:54
they are whatever Pages they look at you want to be able to look at the conversion in reports to see if they're
8:58:00
actually converting based on the goals you've set up whether that's pages per session duration destination or event
8:58:08
goal conversion tracking reports can help you measure who is actually converting and the great thing about
8:58:15
Google analytics here is that I can actually see by segments so the default
8:58:21
segment in a segment is just looking at a specific user set so the default
8:58:28
segment is always all users however I can choose a different segment so if I
8:58:33
want to choose instead of all users if I want to choose Mobile Traffic I can select Mobile Traffic hit apply so I'm
8:58:41
actually now looking at a subset of data I'm looking at mobile traffic so if all
8:58:46
the mobile users have come to my site I can see 1400 engaged or looked at 10
8:58:53
pages or more okay and that's a seven percent conversion rate so the great thing about Google analytics is you have
8:59:00
the opportunity to set up four different goal types okay based on those goal types you can go to goals overview and
8:59:07
look at the conversion rates of each goal but you can also change the
8:59:12
segments of that particular goal to see who exactly converted okay another
8:59:18
report I like under conversions is the multi-channel funnel report so if I click on multi-channel funnel basically
8:59:25
what this allows me to do is see how different channels work together to
8:59:31
convert so remember the channel reporting we looked at under acquisition here I can see now how different
8:59:37
channels work together to drive the conversion so if I look at three channels direct organic and referral I
8:59:44
can see all three together drive two percent of the conversions if I look at direct and referral twelve and a half
8:59:51
percent if I look at direct and organic 12.24 so I can see how different
8:59:57
channels work to together and so if I look at top conversion paths as an
9:00:02
example I can actually see what channels how channels work together to drive the
9:00:08
conversion so in this example I can see over the last 30 days that my top channel grouping was direct times two
9:00:16
meaning that somebody came to the website directly meaning they typed in the URL in the browser or they
9:00:23
bookmarked it and came to the site okay they came the first time but didn't convert but then they came back a second
9:00:29
time via direct and then converted so that combination is my top conversion
9:00:35
combination of the last 30 days my second best conversion grouping is
9:00:41
organic search and direct meaning that a user came to the website via organic
9:00:47
search first did not convert and then came back via direct the second time and
9:00:52
converted so basically what analytics does is give credit to the last refer
9:00:58
girl meaning if you came to the website via referral or referring website and
9:01:04
converted then the referring website's gonna get the credit for the conversion but analytics does a good job of showing
9:01:11
you how different channels work together so a channel may drive a lot of traffic
9:01:16
like organic search but that traffic may not convert the first time around for a
9:01:21
number of different reasons whether it could be brand recognition Price shopping reading content whatever the
9:01:28
case analytics is able to measure if that channel actually did contribute at
9:01:34
a later point and in this case we could see organic search drove traffic that didn't convert but that traffic came
9:01:41
back a second time via direct and did convert so that's our second best
9:01:46
Channel grouping and so the multi-channel funneling Report top conversion pass to me is a good report
9:01:52
to look at so you can actually see not only at channels work together but you can see sources and mediums and
9:01:59
campaigns and how all that all those different campaigns from different sources work together to convert so
9:02:06
that's just a good report to look at there are so many different reports available in analytics there's so many
9:02:14
that we haven't even gotten to yet so my advice if you look at the demo report you can get a feel for each of these
9:02:21
reports under each section whether that be audience acquisition Behavior or
9:02:27
conversions take a look at these reports see what makes sense to you see what you can use to improve your website
9:02:34
performance so if I go to Google analytics and I log in okay what I want
9:02:39
to do is go down to admin click on admin
9:02:44
here and admin will take you to basically a screen that looks like this where you have an account column you
9:02:51
have your property column and then you have review column now the view column is where you're going to go to set up
9:02:58
goals okay so every view in every property has up to 20 goals okay so by
9:03:07
default in analytics you're going to have at least one view for your property
9:03:12
so if I have a property I'm gonna have at least one view but if I happen to set up multiple views like you see here then
9:03:19
I know for every view I set up I have 20 goals to work with so where are those
9:03:25
goals so Under The View I'm going to click on goals and now I could see I
9:03:30
have 20 at my disposal now you can see here by clicking on the recording column
9:03:37
I can see I have in this particular property this particular view I have
9:03:42
five goals that are active so you can use up to 20 but you don't have to have 20 active Okay you can have one active
9:03:51
two active my recommendation is least have one goal again when you set up a
9:03:57
goal you're going to measure everything in analytics against that goal okay so
9:04:03
in this case we have five particular goals we're measuring so we have five active out of 20 total so if I don't
9:04:12
know no longer want to use a goal I could simply just turn it off if I want to continue using it just turn it on
9:04:18
okay it's that simple you could turn on and off goals so here I already have
9:04:24
five set up so if you want to set up a new goal the one thing you need to know
9:04:29
in Google analytics is in order to set up a new goal okay you need to have edit
9:04:35
access at least the view level I would say at the property level so you want to
9:04:41
make sure whoever's in charge of Google analytics for your organization or if
9:04:46
you're in charge okay you simply just want to go to user management and user management you want to make sure the
9:04:52
email address you're using to log into Google analytics has at least edit
9:04:58
permissions so you're going to need edit permissions to add new goals so I have
9:05:04
edit permissions I'm going to go to goals and I want to set up a new goal but before we jump in and set up a new
9:05:11
goal what is it that we want to achieve that's really the question we want to
9:05:17
ask ourselves what is the goal of the website well if it's somebody
9:05:22
downloading something okay are you measuring that download via an event okay are they filling out a form
9:05:29
submission before they download so if they submit that form submission is that the goal or do you have any Commerce
9:05:36
site is somebody purchasing something so these are things you want to ask yourself before you actually set up the
9:05:41
goal what is it that I'm trying to measure now when you actually do go to set up a goal you're going to click on
9:05:48
the red CTA button that says new goal so analytics actually has some templates
9:05:54
set up for you okay you can see them here okay if you're somebody's registering online or creating an
9:06:01
account or reading review downloading something sharing something you could
9:06:07
choose all of these options here what I normally do is choose custom 99 of the
9:06:13
time I'm just going to choose custom it doesn't really matter if you use the template or not it's just a template is
9:06:19
basically some free pre-filled configurations but my recommendation is
9:06:25
always just go with custom you want total control over how to set up your
9:06:30
goal so we already have in mind what type of goal we want to set up so for
9:06:36
example if somebody goes to fill out a form submission and they go to a thank
9:06:41
you page after that well what's the URL of that thank you page we want to be able to track how many people go to that
9:06:48
page because we know if somebody does type in or fill in a form submission and
9:06:54
goes to that page we know that they filled out the form and so for example if I go to continue I'm going to name my
9:07:02
goal first so I'm going to say thank you page as an example notice analytics is
9:07:09
assigning an ID so notice this is goal ID 15. that means that that's the next
9:07:16
available goal there are 20 goals available in analytics and so what analytics does is they group goals
9:07:23
together so one through five six through ten eleven through fifteen sixteen
9:07:28
through twenty into goal sets so for example goal 16 through 20 is part of
9:07:35
goal set for and why does Google analytics combine these goals into different goal sets well because it's
9:07:42
easier to measure and look at data by goal sets so for example if I jump into
9:07:49
any report here if I go to all traffic channels and I want to measure how many
9:07:55
goals by Channel I can look at it by goal set so if I have goal set one
9:08:01
selected then I know any goal I have active in there between goal ID one through goal id5 I'm going to be able to
9:08:08
see those goals and goal set one and now I'm going to be able to measure every goal I have active and goal set one
9:08:15
against the channel so if I choose goal set two whatever goals are active there goal set three Etc notice I don't have
9:08:22
any goals 16 through 20 active that earn goal set four therefore I don't have
9:08:27
that option available to me so back to admin the bottom left navigation again
9:08:33
goals okay we want to measure somebody going to the thank you page we have added access we're going to choose
9:08:40
custom as our goal setup we're going to type in a goal name I'm just going to say thank you okay this is goal 15. now
9:08:48
this is the important part Google analytics has four different goal types
9:08:53
destination duration pages per session or screens percent session screens per
9:08:59
session is related to mobile because Google analytics measures mobile app
9:09:05
activity and then you have an event so we're going to cover all four of these but for the sake of this simple example
9:09:11
I'm going to choose destination why because if somebody goes to that thank you page we're going to go ahead and put
9:09:18
in the thank you page as the goal the goal URL so for example destination is
9:09:25
my choice I'm going to click continue now this is where I'm gonna put the URL
9:09:30
so if my URL is just simply thank you.html I can just go ahead and put
9:09:36
thank you.html or if it's just thank you then I can just do thank you depends on
9:09:43
the website depends on the URI structure so whatever that URL is that's what
9:09:49
you're going to put in and when you're done you can verify it so what Google analytics does is actually we'll verify
9:09:56
over the last seven days is if anybody's actually gone to that particular page so
9:10:02
if we click verify we can see zero percent conversion rate so that tells us that if this is the correct URL then
9:10:10
we've had zero percent people go to that page this is just an example however if
9:10:17
you didn't see a conversion then you might want to make sure you check the URL here that you put in and if you do
9:10:24
see a conversion rate then you know it's working so Google analytics actually has options so we're saying thank you is
9:10:32
equal to so the destination URL is equal to thank you or thank you.html or thank
9:10:39
you dot ESP or whatever that thank you page is okay you do have options so if
9:10:44
you have a long URL you could say it begins with and you could say it begins with say thank you so this is the logic
9:10:52
we're going to say hey if anybody goes to a URL that begins with thank you then
9:10:57
count it as a goal or you could say equals to so if anybody goes to a URL that equals 2 thank you then count it as
9:11:04
a goal you have one more option Here regular expression so Google analytics understands the language of regular
9:11:11
Expressions so regular expressions are just special characters used to
9:11:17
communicate with Google analytics in order to hone in on exactly what you're
9:11:22
trying to track so we can always say you know starts with or ends with so we can
9:11:29
you know use characters like the dollar sign ends with or begins with so we can
9:11:34
always do that so you can use regular Expressions as well if you're familiar with regular Expressions if you're not
9:11:41
then you don't have to use them but there are special characters where that
9:11:46
you can insert in that are used as regular expression so if you're not familiar with regular expression don't
9:11:52
choose that option you can choose the other option of equals to or begins with now now note that on all three of these
9:12:00
options I didn't put the domain so if my domain is Amma Dash foundation.org and
9:12:08
then thank you I don't need to put the domain because analytics are already knows what domain we're tracking so you
9:12:15
don't have to put in the domain here when you're entering in in this case the
9:12:21
Google URL so you can omit the domain so when you put in that URL you know that
9:12:27
you have three options to work with and then you always always want to verify
9:12:33
that goal URL you always want to verify it because if you see zero percent conversion and in this case of the last
9:12:40
seven days then that should tell you something either your goal is not set up correctly or you just don't have any
9:12:47
conversions either way you want to double check that now when it comes to the destination URL goal you do have an
9:12:55
option here for funnel so if I turn on final then that means I have the ability
9:13:00
to track how people went through my funnel so if I have a cart and I want to
9:13:07
be able to check how many people go in and out of the cart then I have the option of adding specific Pages as part
9:13:16
of the cart so we could say you know step one which is basically cart we
9:13:22
could say step two is billing information that could be slash billing
9:13:28
we could see step three is shipping information slash shipping and then step four could be you know confirm and that
9:13:36
could be slash confirmation so whatever your url structure is for your cart and
9:13:42
it doesn't necessarily have to be a cart basically all I'm doing is putting a series of steps with URLs as each step
9:13:49
and why do I want to do that because I can then track how many people go through my funnel that I've created okay
9:13:57
so here I could see this is my funnel that I've created for this particular goal okay and the funnel is only
9:14:04
available for the destination URL so the funnels available if you want to see traffic through the goal okay and how
9:14:12
people go through the funnel and where they drop off now you have an option here to make the first step required so
9:14:19
if you make that first step required then that means you're measuring the funnel through the first step only now
9:14:26
if I turn that off then I'm measuring the funnel through each step meaning that I can measure people as they drop
9:14:33
in and out of the funnel where if it's required the first step then I'm only measuring traffic as it enters in the
9:14:42
top of the funnel so you have that option available to you the funnel and then for all goals you do have a value
9:14:50
so if somebody did actually convert Okay Google analytics is going to count it as
9:14:56
a conversion and you can assign sign a value so if you're not an e-commerce website then you may want to think about
9:15:03
assigning value if you are an e-commerce website then analytics has the ability
9:15:08
to track e-commerce revenue for your website so you don't need to add a value but in this case let's just say your
9:15:16
non-profit organization and you're collecting donations and on average over the past year every
9:15:23
donation that somebody contributed was equal to five dollars well you can just
9:15:28
go ahead and put five dollars in there as the value for that goal so that means
9:15:34
that if somebody did go to in this example slash thank you and convert
9:15:40
analytics is going to count it as a goal and then assign five dollar value
9:15:46
alongside that goal so if you're non-ecommerce if you're say a non-profit
9:15:51
like this organization or your B2B and you want to track some value then you
9:15:57
have that option there so with the destination URL goal you have the option of adding a funnel with all goal types
9:16:04
you have the option of adding a value all goal types and we're going to go through the rest of them you have the
9:16:10
option of verifying that goal so that's the structure of setting up a goal
9:16:15
destination URL is just one goal type we're going to talk about the other
9:16:20
three goal types because in Google analytics there are four goal types again destination is one of them with
9:16:28
destination as you do have the option with all goal types is you have to be
9:16:33
able to choose your logic here so we're going to cover that with the other three but just know when you set up a
9:16:40
destination URL goal you have the option of adding a funnel now when you actually do set up a funnel what's going to
9:16:46
happen is analytics is going to measure traffic as it goes to the final so where
9:16:52
do you look for that funnel information well you want to get out of admin you want to go to the left side navigation
9:16:58
you want to click on conversions then goals then funnel visualization So based
9:17:04
on the funnel you set up you're going to be able to see traffic as it goes through the funnel so notice on this
9:17:11
particular funnel we don't have the first step required why because I could
9:17:17
see traffic as it goes in and out of each step of the funnel so let's go through this funnel and see how people
9:17:23
react so here I can see the first step is the store front page so over this
9:17:30
particular period of time I have 84 sessions enter the storefront page so
9:17:37
out of those 84 I can see 21 left the storefront page 63 went on to the next
9:17:45
step in the funnel which is the cart page I can then see 24 people went on to
9:17:52
the cart page directly and five exited the site all together okay so that gave
9:17:58
me 87 total and from 87 I saw that 82 went on to the next page for the next
9:18:05
step what analytics does is they give you a percentage so in the first step we had 63 move on to the cart page out of
9:18:13
84 that's 75 percent so from the cart page to the create your account page we
9:18:19
had 94 move on so we didn't have anybody enter in the create your account page we
9:18:25
didn't have anybody leave to create your account page so if 82 82 create your
9:18:32
account and then we have 82 move on to the payment page so that's a hundred percent okay we have one exit so we have
9:18:39
81 that proceeded to beyond the payment page which was purchase so 81 of 82 is
9:18:47
98 and we started with 84. so that gave us
9:18:53
plus the 24 that we accumulated along the way so that gave us a 75 funnel
9:19:01
conversion rate so 75 percent of the people who entered in the funnel went on
9:19:06
to purchase okay so don't be confused with the overall e-commerce conversion
9:19:12
rate so 75 is the funnel conversion rate the overall conversion rate for this
9:19:18
particular goal is 18.45 over this particular period of
9:19:23
time why because that takes into account all sessions that have won to the website so 18 of all traffic went on to
9:19:32
convert but those that did go into the final 75 converted so that's a look at
9:19:39
the funnel so if you set up a funnel that's what it's going to look like you have the option to measure everything
9:19:45
from step one and Beyond or measure as traffic goes in and out of the funnel so
9:19:50
the purpose of this is we're going to be able to see where traffic drops off how
9:19:56
effective our funnel Liz what pages we need to address in that funnel okay so
9:20:01
that's the whole point of the funnel and the funnel is available with the destination URL goal so if I go back to
9:20:08
admin if I go back to goals Under The View I can actually see what that funnel
9:20:14
looks like so here we chose regular expression so this is what the URL is
9:20:20
okay you can see our funnel in each of the steps we have set up notice we're using regular Expressions here and then
9:20:27
if we verify this goal we could see over the past seven days 19 conversion rate
9:20:34
so that tells me something's working in this particular with this particular goal because we do have a conversion
9:20:41
rate okay so that's the destination URL goals let's now talk about the other
9:20:46
three types of goals so the next goal type we're going to talk about is pages
9:20:51
per session so if you're not sure what type of goal to set up for your web
9:20:57
website at the very least you should try and set up either duration or Let It Go
9:21:03
or pages per session related goal so let's talk about the pages per session
9:21:08
so basically what this goal is going to allow us to measure is for example if we
9:21:15
set the goal to three pages per session then we're going to be able to measure
9:21:21
if how many people went to the site and looked at three pages per session so
9:21:28
let's take a look at that goal so if I open up the goal here I can see three pages per session is what we're naming
9:21:35
it so basically what we're asking analytics to do is anything greater than
9:21:40
two pages which would be three and Beyond count as a goal so if anybody
9:21:46
comes to the site looks at more than two pages three pages or more then it's
9:21:52
going to count as a goal and so here we can verify it so if we verified over the
9:21:58
last seven days we could see a 4.12 conversion rate and that tells me that
9:22:04
four percent of my traffic over the last seven days looked at at least three
9:22:09
pages or more so you're probably asking yourself well what number should I put
9:22:16
in for the actual variable so in this case we see two well what you want to do
9:22:22
is you want to look at on average let's just say year to day you want to make
9:22:27
sure you have statistical significance so you want to look at a period of time so if you go to analytics go to audience
9:22:34
okay and then if you go to overview and if I change my date range to year to
9:22:39
date I could see on average right now I have 1.21 pages per session so that's on
9:22:47
average so we don't want to make our goal one page we don't want to make our goal two
9:22:53
pages we want to make it three so we want to be able to basically measure at
9:23:00
a higher rate okay why do we want to measure at a higher rate because if 1.21 is the average then two pages per
9:23:07
session really isn't moving the needle so what we really want to do is get people to stay on the site longer look
9:23:14
at Pages more during their session so look at more pages and so we want to be
9:23:21
able to see what segment of the audience is looking at more pages what channels
9:23:26
driving traffic that's looking at more pages what pages are contributing to more pages per session so the whole idea
9:23:34
is you want to hone in on what your goal is and see what's working and then see
9:23:40
what's not working so you can make adjustments the whole idea be on Google analytics is to improves website
9:23:47
performance and so if our average is 1.2 then if we change it to just 2 it may
9:23:54
not be good enough so in this case you know we want to up the bar a little bit so we're going to choose three now you
9:24:00
can choose four or five that's perfectly fine just know if your average is 1.2 I
9:24:06
wouldn't choose one page per session as my goal and I probably wouldn't choose two so I'd set the bar a little bit
9:24:12
higher now the third goal type available in Google analytics is also engagement
9:24:18
related and that's duration so just like pages per session we can measure how
9:24:24
long somebody stays on the website and we could set up a goal for that so in this case I have a goal set for one
9:24:31
minute 30 seconds so my goal type is duration so if I click continue then
9:24:37
basically I'm asking analytics in this case anybody who stays more than one
9:24:43
minute and 30 seconds on the website count it as a goal and so so before you
9:24:49
actually put in the number of hours minutes and seconds you want to look at that average so if you go back to
9:24:55
audience overview here I can see a minute and seven so do we want a minute
9:25:01
and 30 maybe we could do that maybe we can go with two minutes so again the whole point is you want to set the bar a
9:25:08
little bit higher than what the average is and so here I could see over the last seven days if I verify this particular
9:25:15
goal I can see eight percent of my traffic over the last seven days stayed
9:25:21
on the site at least one minute and 31 seconds okay they stay greater than one
9:25:28
minute and thirty and so the whole point is you can hone in because this is a goal I can go in this is goal okay this
9:25:35
is a goal here and so I could see that this is gold 13. so now I can go to
9:25:43
acquisition as an example I can go to channels as an example since this is I
9:25:48
go this is goal 13 so that would be in goal set three so I can actually see
9:25:54
what channel is basically driving that goal okay in other words what channel is
9:26:01
driving traffic that is staying on the side at least one minute 30 seconds and
9:26:06
so that's the whole idea behind goals so likewise for pages per session we can go
9:26:12
into channels and here I can see we have a over this period of time year to date
9:26:19
pages per session we have three percent conversion rate and here I could see for
9:26:26
example organic search has a 13 conversion rate here I could see social
9:26:32
media has a 10 so I could see that or people coming from organic search are
9:26:37
staying on the site longer or they're looking at more pages than any other channel so just like duration or
9:26:45
destination or any goal you set up you can measure that goal against any
9:26:51
Dimension just because his engagement doesn't mean you can't you absolutely
9:26:56
can and so the whole point of Engagement related goals is to figure out what's
9:27:01
driving traffic the site but what traffic is engaging so you want to be able to pinpoint that so you can improve
9:27:09
website performance now the fourth goal type available in Google analytics is an
9:27:16
event so if you click on new goal include custom click continue you have
9:27:21
the option to choose an event so an event is something that you can measure
9:27:28
on your website that analytics can't measure by default so if you want to measure PDF downloads or clicks on
9:27:36
buttons or clicks on play buttons on a video or click on a submit button or
9:27:41
click on an external link I mean you can measure pretty much anything with an event then you want to be able to turn
9:27:49
that event into a goal so let's quickly summarize what an event is so again we
9:27:56
want to be able to measure a particular event that happens on the website so in
9:28:01
order to do so we need to identify that event so if I go to for example this
9:28:08
particular website here and I want to measure how many times somebody clicks
9:28:14
on the Donate Now button well if I met I can measure that as an event so when you
9:28:19
set up an event in analytics you have to actually assign a category and an action
9:28:25
for that event so that's the first thing you need to do when you identify an
9:28:31
event or let it go first you need to set up the event in order to set up the event you need to assign a category in
9:28:39
action okay so once you identify what you want to track as an event on your website you're actually going to go on a
9:28:46
tag manager or have your web Master go on a tag manager and set up a tag and in
9:28:52
that tag they're going to assign that particular category in action and so
9:28:57
here you can see we have this set up our category is named donate now and our
9:29:04
action is click and that's what we want to do we want to measure how many people click on that donate Now button so
9:29:10
anytime somebody does that then the category donate now is going to appear
9:29:16
in analytics with the action click so when you actually do set up an event you
9:29:22
can go into analytics and you could test that event so if I go to the website and
9:29:28
I click donate now Okay the reason why I have this as an event is because I'm
9:29:33
taking to a third-party website to handle the donations so here I can go
9:29:39
into analytics and now I can see a category is being fired for header donate with the action click so that's
9:29:46
my category and that's my action so that category in action is what is firing
9:29:52
after somebody clicks on the Donate Now button so if I want to turn this event
9:29:58
into a goal I can easily do that now that I've set up the event now that I've
9:30:04
identified the category in action I want to go back to admin and set up the event
9:30:10
with these parameters in place so just turns out we already have the goal set
9:30:16
up so let's go through how this goal is set up so first we chose custom we chose
9:30:21
event we gave it a name so has the best practice when you actually set up a goal
9:30:27
as an event or turn an event into a goal I would add the prefix event colon to it
9:30:35
and then that way when you're identifying goals in your reporting you know it's an event so I'm going to click
9:30:41
continue and now that I've actually have set up the event already in Google tag
9:30:47
manager I giving it a category give it an action okay see here you can see we
9:30:52
have a regular expression set up so anything with the header donate or
9:30:58
donate is going to fire this goal so over the last seven days I have a 0.81
9:31:03
conversion rate okay I could have easily put in equals two and put in whatever
9:31:10
the action what or the category which is donate now or I could have put action
9:31:15
equals click I could have done that as well so let me show you another example here so if I do this custom continue
9:31:24
events donate now here's my goal ID it's going to be an event so all I need to do
9:31:31
is put in the category in action so donate now and then click so that's all
9:31:37
I have to do and that's my goal so I can verify it okay to see if anybody's fired
9:31:42
it and basically that's what I need to do to turn that event into to a goal
9:31:48
okay so you need to set up for an event first you need to identify the event set
9:31:54
it up and Google tag manager which is another platform and once you've done that then you have your category in
9:32:01
action once you have your category in action you're again going to go into analytics and then simply put in that
9:32:08
category in action into the appropriate fields to set up your event related goal
9:32:13
now all events don't have to be turned into a goal if you actually do set up an
9:32:19
event and you're not worthy of a goal meaning it's not a kpi or a dozen align
9:32:27
with your business goals well don't fret you can always just go to behavior okay
9:32:32
you can always go to events you can always go to overview and measure your
9:32:37
events that way so here you can see all of our events that are fired now we do
9:32:43
have this one turn into a goal so if it's important for a business then we want to make sure we we convert that
9:32:49
particular event into a goal okay if it's not important for example somebody's just clicking on a social
9:32:55
button then you don't necessarily have to turn that event into a goal if you
9:33:00
don't want to know that it's sitting here under events under Behavior so the
9:33:06
point I'm trying to make here if it's important to your business and you're already tracking it as an event via
9:33:11
Google tag manager then feel free to turn it into a goal all you need is a
9:33:17
category all you need is that action and so so one final note on that event
9:33:22
related goal just like any other goal you can add a value okay so if I have an
9:33:28
event set up I can choose to add a value here or in Google tag manager if I've
9:33:35
assigned a value to that event so if I go back to the actual event and Google
9:33:42
tag manager you can see I have a value set up for one dollar then I could just go into analytics and say you know what
9:33:47
I already have the value added so go ahead and use the value added in Google
9:33:53
tag manager okay so I'm going to choose yes now if I choose no I have the option
9:33:58
to add the value here just like I would with any other goal so just keep that in
9:34:04
mind you can add a value to any goal type with an event related go you can
9:34:10
add the value right into the tag in Google tag manager just as I've done
9:34:16
here so remember when you actually set up your goals whether it's a destination pages per session duration or an event
9:34:24
you can just go ahead and choose that goal set that it's in and measure any
9:34:30
Dimension against that particular goal so here I can see e newsletter sign ups
9:34:36
by Channel I can go into another goal set here I can see contact form
9:34:41
submissions okay I can see what particular channels driving contact form
9:34:46
submissions okay so just know that you can align a goal against any Dimension
9:34:52
so if you have e-commerce you don't have to set up for goal for that that's
9:34:57
separate but if you want to take a look at your goals and analytics and on its
9:35:03
own you can just go to conversions goals overview here I can actually get a good
9:35:10
sense of how my goals are performing over a period of time so again if I
9:35:15
choose for example year to date now I could see based on the goals I've set up
9:35:21
how many total goal completions value which takes into account the value we've
9:35:26
added into these goals okay the total conversion rate and here I can see it broken down by the goal I actually have
9:35:33
set up and I can see it by Page or I could see it by Source a medium so I
9:35:38
could see Google organic is driving the most gold completions then Google CPC
9:35:43
direct and then I could see some others in here as well out contributing to
9:35:49
goals now I do want to point your attention to another report in Google
9:35:54
analytics that does take into account goals and that's multi-channel funneling
9:35:59
so again under conversion goals multi-channel funnels if I go to
9:36:05
assistant conversions I can actually see what channel in this example is
9:36:12
assisting with the conversions I've set up and so what do we mean by assistive conversions well that means that if a
9:36:20
channel let's just say organic search drove traffic to the website and that traffic didn't convert when it arrived
9:36:27
at the website and left but it came back a week later via another Channel let's
9:36:33
just say email and when they came back via email they did convert during that session well what analytics does is they
9:36:40
give an assist to organic search because they help Drive the traffic to the
9:36:46
website so it's similar to the game of basketball if I have the ball and I pass
9:36:51
it to my colleague and my colleagues the one who scores because they had the ball last well they get the credit for the
9:36:58
point I.E the conversion but I get an assist and so analytics works the same
9:37:04
way they're always going to give credit to the last click or direct conversion
9:37:09
but they will give credits to the channel in this case that assisted with
9:37:15
the conversion so that's under a cystic inversion and that's based on the goals
9:37:21
you have set up you can highlight any particular goal here if I want to hone
9:37:26
in on say the Donate clicks only then I'm going to be able to see what
9:37:32
contributed to that particular goal so there's another report in here top
9:37:38
conversion pass that I think is important so after you set up your goals you can actually see what channels in
9:37:45
this particular example help to Drive conversions again this is year to day so
9:37:50
I can see all the different combinations of channels that work together to contribute to a conversion so again I
9:37:59
can choose a specific goal or I can choose all my goals so those two reports
9:38:06
are under multi-channel funneling there's also another report that I think is good that's time lag meaning how long
9:38:13
did it actually take somebody to convert so here you can see most of our
9:38:18
conversions 265 year-to-date happen on the day somebody arrived on the website
9:38:24
but I could see I did get some conversions a day later two days later Etc so you have time lag top conversion
9:38:31
pass assistant conversions they're all under multi-channel funneling and they're all available after you set up
9:38:38
at least one goal and so if you're not sure what goal to set up okay don't fret
9:38:44
you can always at least set up an engagement related goal so that's available to you duration pages per
9:38:51
session you also have destination and event tracking and they're all available to you you have 20 available per view
9:38:59
now if you're not quite sure exactly what type of goal to set up there is an
9:39:05
option available in analytics and that's the gallery so you can always import a
9:39:11
goal from the gallery so in other words we could take a look at what other
9:39:16
people have set up in terms of goals so you just have to click on the button import from gallery and it'll take you
9:39:23
to the gallery and you'll be able to see what are the goals others have set up so many of you out there have a website
9:39:30
similar to the one I'm looking at now this is a non-profit that I work with I'm a foundation and like this website
9:39:38
and probably like your website you probably have some interactivity on there that needs to be tracked for
9:39:45
example buttons if you have buttons like this one that says donate or newsletter
9:39:51
sign up or there's a PDF download or a video that needs to be you know tracked
9:39:58
based on the amount of people who click on the play button so I mean all sorts of inter activity on a website have you
9:40:05
ever wondered how to track that well there is a way to track that because by default Google analytics can't track
9:40:13
interactivity and engagement on your website like you probably want to have
9:40:18
your website tracked so if you have buttons and videos and things of that nature that you want to have tracked but
9:40:24
you're going to need event tracking and if you're in analytics and you're always wandering around the data and you happen
9:40:30
to find yourself under events well if you want events on your website and you
9:40:36
want data to populate under Behavior top events you're going to need to set up
9:40:42
event tracking so event tracking is a two-part process and we're going to talk
9:40:47
about that two-part process the first part of that is to identify what you
9:40:52
want to track okay so if we go back to our example website here I'm a foundation again we noted there's a lot
9:40:59
to track here we gotta donate now Bob we got a newsletter sign up we have some social icons okay we got a donate Now
9:41:06
button here we got a play button here got all sorts of interactivity you know we got a button here that says you know
9:41:13
purchase tickets for an upcoming event I can go throughout the website and find different buttons and things to to track
9:41:20
let me just say this there's no shortage of what you can track on your website with event tracking so event tracking is
9:41:29
just basically in layman's terms tracking engagement on your site because Google analytics by default is only
9:41:34
going to track page view data meaning how somebody got to your website what
9:41:40
page they looked at how long they stayed on that page what page they left from more or less their timing how long
9:41:47
somebody stays on the website and what pages they look at so there's more to a website than just how long somebody
9:41:53
stayed on a page and so in this example we want to be able to track everything
9:41:58
here not just the donating album but everything because once you get the hang of event tracking then it's very easy to
9:42:05
set up okay so step one identify what you want to track okay so there's a lot
9:42:11
we want to track we're just going to use one example to start off with and that's going to be this donate Now button okay
9:42:17
so this donate Now button we want to track now we have a newsletter sign up
9:42:23
we have Facebook and and that's fine you could track all that but for the sake of
9:42:28
going through a step-by-step process today let's just focus on the Donate Now button what's focus on the Donate Now
9:42:35
button then we'll come back and start tracking these other things but this is what we want to track to start out with okay so step one identify what you want
9:42:42
to track now when it comes to tracking events on a website you want to identify find those events so we did that by
9:42:49
choosing this donate Now button now once we identify what we want to track we
9:42:55
need to assign two parameters for that event so with event tracking you have
9:43:02
three parameters but one is actually optional so you have two mandate mandatory parameters that you have to
9:43:09
assign to everything you want to track on your website and that's the category and then the action so event label or
9:43:17
label is the third parameter but again that's optional okay so basically when
9:43:23
we identify an event on our website we want to assign it a category and an
9:43:28
action okay so why do we want to assign it a category in an action because when
9:43:33
we're in analytics under Behavior under events top events we could see we have
9:43:39
different categories here and we have different actions we have different labels so if I click on any one of these
9:43:45
Dimensions I'm going to be able to see sum of the parameters I've entered in for previous events I'm tracking okay so
9:43:52
the whole idea is you want to be able to group different events together into a
9:43:58
category and assign an action and assign a label to it that's really what you're doing you're just grouping and
9:44:04
identifying the events you're trying to track and so in this case I have this
9:44:10
donate Now button sitting in the header okay in fact I have a lot of things sitting in the header so if I wanted to
9:44:16
and I want to track all these buttons I can create a category called header and then if I track all these buttons all
9:44:22
these buttons can sit in that same category if I wanted to or I can create a separate category for each of these
9:44:29
buttons it's up to you how you organize your categories because basically all
9:44:34
you're doing is giving a name to what you're trying to track and the name is equivalent to a category so in this case
9:44:40
the Donate Now button is very important I'm just going to call it category header donate now I need to give an
9:44:46
action to each category and so in this case I'm just going to say click because
9:44:52
that's what the action is doing it's it's somebody's taking the action of clicking now if it's a video and it's a
9:44:58
play button I can assign an action of play it's up to you whatever you name
9:45:04
these parameters you just need to be organized and methodical about what you name it that's all and so in this case
9:45:11
header donate and then click okay and so that's our category in action and so
9:45:17
that's clearly step two so step one identify what you want to track step two
9:45:22
assign a category action and or label but remember label is optional so if we
9:45:29
go back in analytics here I could see some categories and if I click on action I can see some actions that I've named
9:45:35
now step three so we've identified in Step One what we want to track we've
9:45:41
assigned a category in action so step three is going into Google tag manager
9:45:48
to set up the event okay so if you're not familiar with Google tag manager
9:45:54
then you can easily just you know do a Google search for Google tag manager and
9:46:01
basically you'll have all sorts of information on it there's a good video overview of tag manager here that you
9:46:08
can watch so tag manager basically is what we want to use to set up event
9:46:15
track and now tag managers use for a lot of different things but the main thing we're doing here is setting up an event
9:46:22
for our website and so I'm logged in to the same email address I'm using for
9:46:28
analytics okay so now I'm in tag manager and I want to set up my event for this
9:46:35
donate Now button so what do I need to do well for every event I want to set up
9:46:41
I need to set up a tag okay so if I go to tags I can see I already have some
9:46:46
tags set up up and some of these are events and so when you actually set up a
9:46:52
tag I recommend having a naming convention so here you can see any event we set up we start out by calling it GA
9:46:59
Dash event Dash whatever it is we're trying to set up and so in this case we want to set up a new tag for the Donate
9:47:07
Now button on our website so we're in Google tag manager because tag manager is what's going to fire that event so if
9:47:14
I click on new okay and I click on tag configuration I'm going to choose Google
9:47:19
analytics and then I'm going to choose event as my track type so we want the
9:47:25
data to show up in Google analytics and we're tracking an event we're not tracking a page view we're tracking an
9:47:31
event and so now remember in step two you identified what you want to call
9:47:37
that category you identify what you want to call that action and you have some optional parameters like label so first
9:47:43
things first header donates the name of our category story and our action is
9:47:48
click and if you want to add in a label and a value so if you want to sign a
9:47:54
value you can if you want to add in a label you can okay those are optional so
9:47:59
you just need to focus on category in action and then the last setting here that's probably worth mentioning is a
9:48:06
non-interaction hit okay so this is automatically set to false and why is it
9:48:12
set to false because it's a non-interaction no that's false we want this event if somebody clicks on the
9:48:19
header donate to be an interaction so for example if I land on this page here
9:48:25
and I click on that donate Now button that I'm tracking as an event and I
9:48:30
actually leave the site because I have my settings set to false I want that
9:48:36
click to be an interaction then analytics is not going to count a bounce if I change it to true so from false to
9:48:44
true then that means it is going to be an non-interaction if somebody lands on the
9:48:50
page and if somebody clicks on the button so I don't want it to be a bounce I want it to be an interaction so my
9:48:57
advice is leave it set to false we're going to choose Google analytics as our
9:49:02
setting here this is our variable for Google analytics so in other words that variable is set to our analytics
9:49:09
property ID and more or less that's what you need to do to set up the tag okay
9:49:16
you need to in step two identify the category in action and or label and or
9:49:22
value now value can be anything you want you're assigning a numerical value so if
9:49:27
you just assign one anytime that event fires in analytics it's going to have a
9:49:33
value of one okay and so we have our non-interaction set to fall so anytime the event fires it's going to count as
9:49:40
an interaction and therefore not count as a bounce if somebody landed on that
9:49:45
page so that's more or less all you need to do to set up the tag and Google tag
9:49:52
manager now if somebody else is setting up the tag for you then again you want to revert to step two you want to be
9:49:59
able to give that person the appropriate category action and or label and or
9:50:05
value why because you're the one that's going to be going into Google analytics and you're the one that's going to have
9:50:11
to go to behavior events top events and look for the particular at category in
9:50:18
action and or label so you need to be able to communicate that information to whomever is setting up the tag now if
9:50:26
it's you great you already know what it is because you're entering that information into tag manager so in this
9:50:33
case I'm going to go ahead and choose a variable for my label parameter and why
9:50:40
do I want to do that because in tag manager I have something at my disposal
9:50:46
called variables and variables allow you to see specifically things that are
9:50:52
being tracked so in this case I chose page path okay so pagepath is a URL and
9:50:57
why did I choose pagepath as my variable for the parameter label because if
9:51:03
somebody does click on the header donate button and the header donate button on
9:51:09
our website is on every page so if I go to the children's page I'm still going to see that header donate button and so
9:51:16
for me I want to be able to see what page somebody clicked on that hitter
9:51:22
donate button and so this allows me to actually see in Google analytics what
9:51:28
page somebody clicked on the header donate Now button and so now if I go back to GTM Google tag manager I have a
9:51:35
category I have an action and I have a label which is a variable okay so note that in Google tag manager you have a
9:51:42
lot of different variables at your disposal and variables are there to help help you identify specifically what is
9:51:50
being tracked so take a look at all the variables at your disposal and tag manager in this example I'm using page
9:51:57
path so now once you set up your tag pretty straightforward again tag types
9:52:03
Google analytics track type is event you are assigning the category action and or
9:52:09
label and or value you're changing or leaving the default in place for
9:52:14
non-interaction hit and then you're choosing the variable for Google analytics which is your property ID so
9:52:21
once you've done that you have a tag the second part of setting up a tag is to assign a trigger to that tag so tag
9:52:30
manager needs to be able to know when to fire that event and so here I'm going to
9:52:36
look at a trigger I've already set up for this particular event and so if I
9:52:42
click on it I'll be able to see that what it is is a click on some links not
9:52:48
all links but some links I'm actually saying Hey Google tag manager fire this
9:52:55
event when the click ID equals header donate button now it just so happens
9:53:01
that if somebody did click on this donate Now button they're gonna go to
9:53:07
another website in this case networkforgood.com so in tag manager I
9:53:14
could have set the trigger to equal URL equal instead of Click ID I could have
9:53:21
said URL equal networkforgood.com so that could have
9:53:26
been my Logic for my trigger in this case I decided to go with the click ID
9:53:33
and so in this case that button has an ID associated with it called header
9:53:40
donate button so if you wanted to use click ID for your event for your button
9:53:45
you could simply just go to the website you can right click on that button and
9:53:51
click inspect element and so when I actually inspect the element I can see now the button here you can see it's
9:53:58
highlighted in the upper Pane and in the lower pane I can see where it's linking to it's linking to networkforgood.com
9:54:05
but here you can see if I hone in a little and I could see ID equals header
9:54:10
Dash donate dash button so that's the click ID notice there's also a class I
9:54:15
could have set the trigger to equal this class or again I could have set the
9:54:20
trigger to equal the URL or the page that this button is pointing to I could
9:54:26
have chosen any one of those but I decided to go with the ID so this is the ID I chose and that's the ID I have in
9:54:36
my trigger okay so that is what's going to fire that event so if somebody clicks
9:54:42
on a button that equals header Dash donate dash button it's going to to fire
9:54:47
that event which is going to equal category header donate action click and
9:54:53
then the label is going to be page path so now that we've set up our event we
9:54:59
want to test to see if it actually works so there's two ways to go about testing an event and the first way is through
9:55:06
Google analytics so if we go to Google analytics and then we go to real time okay we can go to events and here you
9:55:15
can see one is already fired so let's go ahead and go to and test this and go to
9:55:21
the website so if I go here for example and I click on amagar alumni okay so if
9:55:28
I click on that you can see I'm under our family and if I click on that button
9:55:33
then go back to analytics and look at real time I should be able to see this
9:55:39
event fire so if I click on it I'm going to go to network for good now if I go back to analytics here in real time
9:55:47
under real time under events per second I can see that event firing category
9:55:53
equals header donate the action equals click now if I click on the category
9:56:00
here I can see the label the label remember was page path and here you can
9:56:05
see this event fired on the our family page which was the page I was just on so
9:56:11
that's one way to test to see if your event works and in this case analytics
9:56:16
recognize the event so it works it fired and so therefore it's going to show up
9:56:23
under Behavior under events you can go under overview or top events okay and
9:56:29
what am I going to look for in this case I'm going to look for header donate okay if I click on header donate as my
9:56:36
category I'm going to be able to see my action and if I click on action I'll be able to see my label in this case home
9:56:43
page and then later on when the data propagates in analytics I'll be be able to see under label the page that I
9:56:50
clicked on that header donate button which is slash our family okay the second way in which you can test to see
9:56:57
if an event fires is if you preview so if I click on preview in tag manager
9:57:04
okay I'm going to go into preview mode okay in preview mode allows you to see in analytics and tag manager and on the
9:57:13
website what tags are firing so here I could see I'm in preview mode now so I'm
9:57:19
going to go to the website and I'm going to refresh and in my browser same
9:57:26
browser I'm using for tag manager I can see the tags that are being fired on
9:57:32
this page already okay because I'm in preview mode so here I could see remarketing I could see page views I
9:57:39
could see Google optimize I could see some tags that are already firing on this page now if I click on this button
9:57:46
here by holding down my shift command and then click on that button I'll be able to see that the tag fired in
9:57:54
preview mode there's my event header donate and I can see it fired so now I
9:57:59
can see it fired in the preview mode so in addition to Google analytics in
9:58:05
preview mode I could see that that tag is fired and I know that it's working so
9:58:10
there you have you have two ways to test to see if the event fires again you have
9:58:15
real time and analytics okay so in real time if you just go up to real time all
9:58:21
you need to do is go down to events go to your website click on the button if
9:58:26
you see it firing in real time then you know it works the second version or second way to test your event is through
9:58:33
the preview mode okay if you see it firing in preview mode then you know it's also working okay so let's rehash
9:58:41
our steps first step is we want to be able to identify what we want to track
9:58:47
okay so it could be this newsletter sign up it could be click on a Facebook it could be anything we want to be able to
9:58:54
track an image a click on a CTA button whatever we want to track identify it
9:59:00
second step identify the category action and label because that's what's going to
9:59:06
show up in Google analytics remember label is optional variable or excuse me
9:59:11
value is optional third step go into tag manager actually set up your tag and
9:59:18
your trigger so if you set up a tag and it's an event name it GA Dash events
9:59:25
that way you can see in your list of tags and tag manager what event tracking
9:59:30
you have already set up so when you set up your tag you set up your trigger your trigger is based on logic that can be a
9:59:37
URL it can be a click ID it can be a class ID whatever you want to use to
9:59:43
fire that event and then once you do that you you want to test it you could test it in GTM or you could test it in
9:59:50
Google analytics if it doesn't fire you want to tweak your trigger if it does
9:59:55
fire then great and then one thing I would recommend is if you're setting up
10:00:01
various events for your website as a best practice what I would recommend is
10:00:07
set up a spreadsheet and in that spreadsheet you know you want to put a note what's firing what are you doing to
10:00:13
fire it could be in this case someone somebody clicks on the Donate Now button in the header you want to put the tag
10:00:19
name in here the type okay then you want to record your category action and label
10:00:25
and then the great thing about events is you could turn those events into goals
10:00:31
and that's as simple as going back into analytics okay so if I go into analytics
10:00:36
and I go to admin and I go to goals if you set up a new goal okay all you need
10:00:42
to do is choose custom click continue you're going to choose event as your
10:00:48
goal name and then from a naming perspective in Google analytics for your
10:00:53
goal I would definitely put event first and then click on header donate okay so
10:00:59
if I click now continue what is my category it's equal to header donate my
10:01:05
action is click and so I can verify to see if this is working and here I can
10:01:11
see in analytics that the goal would have a 0.22 percent conversion rate so
10:01:17
that tells me that the goal is working and I can turn this event into a goal and when you turn something into a goal
10:01:24
in analytics then you can measure it across all dimensions that's what I
10:01:29
would recommend if the event is equal to a kpi or business goal or it's of
10:01:36
importance something you really want to measure okay if it's just a click say on a Facebook button I wouldn't recommend
10:01:42
setting that up as a goal okay so once you've set up your event you're recorded it in your spreadsheet it's firing you
10:01:50
want to be able to then go back into Behavior back into events okay you can
10:01:55
go to top events okay so top events tell you by category as a default what events
10:02:02
are firing or what category is firing the most okay so if I choose my date range here I can just go to here to date
10:02:10
so here I can see my enter donate button fortunately for me has the most total
10:02:16
events now notice in analytics you also see unique events and so the difference
10:02:22
between unique events and total events is that unique events are equivalent to
10:02:28
one per session where total events means that somebody can come to your website
10:02:33
initiate a session and click on that button multiple times in the same
10:02:39
session so if I go to the alma Foundation website okay I can click on that donate Now button three or four or
10:02:47
five different times in the same session so what analytics is going to do is actually in that session count it once
10:02:54
but accumulate the number of clicks as a total event for that session so you're
10:02:59
always going to have more total events than unique events because in some cases
10:03:04
users May click on the button more than once in the same session and so here I
10:03:10
can see total events unique events and if I added a value to that event I
10:03:16
should be able to see it here so if I added a dollar as an example to this
10:03:22
particular event because it had 164 unique events I should be able to see
10:03:27
164 as my value but since I see Zero that means that I did not assign value
10:03:33
and so average value basically is just giving me how much average I have per
10:03:40
event so it's taking into account the number of or the value the total value 2
10:03:46
divided by the total number of unique Pages or sessions and so because I don't
10:03:53
have value I'm not going to have average value but here you can see because value is optional here I can at least see how
10:04:00
many events or how many clicks I receive for a particular button again it could
10:04:06
be a video if I clicked on this video as an example I can see how many people
10:04:11
actually started it I could see the unique and the total events and if I click on label if I have a label
10:04:18
assigned then I'll be able to see what page triggered that event so if we go
10:04:23
back again to our header donate button back to category if we click on label as
10:04:30
our primary Dimension here we can see the home page had the most unique events
10:04:35
been followed by the children's page the contact form Etc so what you can do in analytics you can also look at the pages
10:04:42
that have driven events so here I could see the home page has accumulate related the most total events followed by the
10:04:49
contact us so that's how you would look at the data in Google analytics under
10:04:55
Behavior under events and then under top events or overview is where you can
10:05:01
start analyzing your event tracking so first you need to do identify it assign
10:05:07
a category action enter label set up that tag and Trigger once you do that
10:05:12
once you test that it's working this is where you're going to go to analyze the data let's start out with why GTM so
10:05:20
let's just say your Sam and you have your own e-commerce website you want to
10:05:26
understand how people are interacting with your website well Sam today's world
10:05:32
of websites contain a lot of interactivity everything from videos to
10:05:37
PDF downloads to commenting to form submissions uh to all sorts of chat
Google Tag Manager
10:05:45
functionality interactivity going on throughout the website so there's just a lot that you need to track outside of
10:05:53
just page views and so really what GTM does is they help you track all these
10:05:59
things I just mentioned everything from somebody clicking on the play button of a PDF to somebody clicking on the submit
10:06:05
button of a form to somebody entering in something on a chat function so that's
10:06:11
what GTM is so why GTM because it helps us track all that interactivity so all
10:06:17
GTM is is really allows you to really place a piece of java code which is just
10:06:23
script and this script that's added to a web page to collect information so
10:06:29
that's really what a tag is it's just some script that gets put on a web page in order for you to collect information
10:06:35
like page views clicks Etc and they send it to third-party tools okay so that's
10:06:42
what GTM does it basically allows you to take all these tags that collect
10:06:48
information and you can use them in GTM so if you want to for example collect
10:06:55
how many people you know enter a chat functionality and start chatting well
10:07:02
you're going to take that script and you're going to put it in GTM and GTM will then allow you to start tracking
10:07:08
that information so that's really what GTM is it just allows you to put tags into a container or think of it as a toy
10:07:16
box you have all these toys and you want to track well you can put all those those toys or tags in a toy box or
10:07:22
container we're going to talk a little bit more about that but before we get into GTM let's just say you know you're
10:07:30
communicating with your developer and there's a new user request on your web page and you want to update the tag well
10:07:37
your developer considering it's probably a small update your website is probably
10:07:43
gonna not hesitate Tate and is going to go ahead and turn around and do it normally and so normally what happens is
10:07:51
the developer is going to go to the website and update the tag well what if you have a few things that you want to
10:07:57
track all those things I mentioned before from downloads to clicks to you know somebody checking out to watching a
10:08:04
video well your Web Master your web developer is going to go well hold on a second now all these requests are going
10:08:11
to take time I need to put them into the work queue so to speak well what happens
10:08:16
is when they go into work queue usually it's going to take some time and in some
10:08:21
cases you as a marketer need to launch a campaign and you want to get that
10:08:26
tracking added to the website in time for the campaign launch so you want to go ahead and quickly turn around the
10:08:33
tracking for that particular campaign let's just say you're launching a campaign and you're sending people to a
10:08:39
landing page that has a form submission and you want to be able to track how many people click on the submit button
10:08:44
of that form submission well if you need to turn that around your developer's like well I need to put that in a work queue the timing isn't going to always
10:08:51
work out between you and your developer is my point and so that's where GTM comes in because there is a solution to
10:08:58
update your tags faster and that's Google tag manager so when we say GTM
10:09:04
that's what GTM stands for Google tag manager it's a place for you to add tags quickly and easily so tags remember are
10:09:13
just Snippets of code that allow you to track things on your website interactively interactive actively and
10:09:20
basically when you have GTM you can bypass the webmaster and do it quickly
10:09:26
and easily so that's what GTM is all about so why GTM because we just
10:09:31
identified two benefits one you could track all the interactivity on your website and two you can bypass your web
10:09:39
developer or webmaster and so that's the benefit of GTM so the benefit you get
10:09:45
those tags updated very quickly via Google tag manager okay so that's what
10:09:51
tag manager is so what we're going to talk about today is specifically what
10:09:56
tag manager is and what it does we're going to list some of the benefits of tag manager we're going to show you how
10:10:02
it works and then we're going to show you how to get started with tag manager tag manager if you're not familiar with
10:10:08
working with webmasters and dealing with JavaScript and tags and all this jargon
10:10:14
is just new to you today okay well don't fret sit back we're gonna take it slow
10:10:19
this is an introduction into Google tag manager again let's start out with what is tag manager so we've already
10:10:25
introduced it to some degree because we already introduced as a tool where you
10:10:31
can put all your tags into a toolbox toy box or container so to speak right and
10:10:37
we already already mentioned that hey you can bypass your webmaster so you're probably thinking well if I'm if you're not familiar with tag manager how can I
10:10:43
bypass my webmaster well first about to free tool and it's a Google tool hence
10:10:49
the name Google tag manager and it helps you really that's the main point it's deploy and track tags on your website
10:10:55
bypassing your webmaster so that's tag manager and so examples of tags that can
10:11:01
be deployed via Google tag manager are numerous these are just some examples
10:11:06
like Google analytics Facebook's pixel tracking or Google ads There's No Limit
10:11:12
into the number of texts you can track and tag manager there is no limit you
10:11:18
can add any number of tracking tags and tag manager okay so some of the benefits
10:11:24
well again I we just listed two you can put any tag into tag manager and track
10:11:30
that onto your website and we know you can bypass your web developer or webmaster and what it also does is it
10:11:36
also allows you to test and deploy your JavaScript codes quicker so remember
10:11:42
these JavaScript codes or Snippets of codes are are just there to track
10:11:48
certain things on your website whether that be a page view or somebody clicking on a play button or tracking somebody
10:11:55
who converts or even just goes to your website so the biggest benefit is you can take that snippety code let's just
10:12:01
say Facebook let's just say you're growing Facebook marketing and you want to put that Facebook pixel on your
10:12:07
website so that you could track people who come from Facebook and convert well you don't need to put that Facebook
10:12:13
pixel on your website you can go right to tag manager and you can put that snippet of code right in tag manager
10:12:19
really quickly and the other benefit here is all tags are managed in one
10:12:25
place and that's that to me is really a good benefit because when you start adding tags on your website and you have
10:12:31
some tags and tag manager it just gets very confusing so ideally all the
10:12:36
tracking codes you have on your website needs to be in tag manager think about that all the tracking so if you're doing
10:12:42
Bing or you're doing Facebook or you're doing Twitter or you're doing LinkedIn and you're doing Google you're doing all
10:12:48
this type of marketing on all these different platforms you're going to have tracking code for all these different
10:12:53
platforms and instead of putting all that code on your website return gonna slow down the load time of your web page
10:13:00
and website you want to put them all in tag manager so they can be organized and you know exactly what you're trying to
10:13:07
track and the other great benefit of tag manager is there's a versioning control so let's just say you have added tags to
10:13:15
your website via GTM for the last six months well and let's just say you add
10:13:20
another tag yesterday if you added that tag yesterday and something doesn't work well you can just roll back to a
10:13:26
previous version It's that simple so you have versioning and that's that's a good thing when you have versioning you can
10:13:32
control what gets published and if something doesn't work after it gets published then you can roll back to a
10:13:37
previous version so it's a a peace of mind so to speak just because you've added code to your site there's no
10:13:43
guarantee it's going to work and so you can always control what version you're dealing with in tag manager and we'll
10:13:49
talk a little bit more about that so the biggest benefit here to me with tag manager is you have event tracking and
10:13:56
so we talked about some of the things you could track on your website from videos from play buttons to somebody
10:14:03
clicking on the stop on the video or pausing it all the way to somebody again
10:14:08
chatting or let's just say somebody clicking on that purchase button on your
10:14:14
website okay and you want to track all these different things these different interactivities and buttons well event
10:14:20
tracking is what you're going to use to track all those buttons and to me this is the biggest benefit of tag manager
10:14:27
and I'll show you some examples as we go along and if we didn't mention it already I'll mention it again it is free
10:14:33
tag manager is free there's no limit so once you have tag manager going you can add as many tracking codes as you want
10:14:40
there's no limit on the number of tracking codes you can add to tag manager okay so it's it's free and you
10:14:47
can use it to its fullest Advantage okay so it's also high security meaning that it has different levels of permissions
10:14:53
okay so you can have uh somebody just go in and look at the different tags and
10:14:59
tracking codes you have in GTM or you can ask somebody who is very familiar with tag manager it can go in and add
10:15:06
the tracking code to tag manager and then publish that tracking code when it gets added so those are all the benefits
10:15:11
let's talk about how it works now specifically how does tag Manager work because you're like Rob okay again a lot
10:15:18
of jargon you know you you got tags and JavaScript and and versioning and
10:15:24
Publishing and all this other stuff well I know I'm throwing a lot at you at once but just bear with me here okay so let's
10:15:31
start talking about how it actually works so you have a website okay
10:15:36
whatever that domain is you have a website and there's chances are on your website you have some form of
10:15:43
interactivity whether that be a video whether that be a Blog whether it be a form submission you have a website with
10:15:50
some interactivity and let's just say you're even thinking about getting ready to launch some type of campaign on maybe
10:15:56
Google or Facebook and you want to drive traffic to your website fair enough you're joining the millions of other
10:16:01
websites that are out there that have interactivity that also Drive traffic to the website so incomes Google tag
10:16:08
manager and so tag manager is important because again we know we want to track people coming from that Facebook
10:16:14
campaign or that Google campaign and interacting with our site so if you are running Facebook and you are running
10:16:21
Google analytics well guess what you want to put that tracking code in tag
10:16:26
manager so Google analytics being a Google product works very nicely with tag manager Facebook has its own
10:16:33
tracking code but you still want to be able to track people who come from the Facebook campaign to your website so
10:16:39
you're gonna get that tracking code from Facebook and put it in tag manager that's generally how it works so so pair
10:16:46
information from your website is shared with another data source through tag manager so think about that if I add
10:16:52
Facebook tracking code to tag manager or let's just say a Google analytics tracking code to tag manager tag manager
10:17:00
is the one that's pushing out and doing all the heavy lifting they're the ones that are controlling what code gets
10:17:07
fired and what code doesn't so if you're putting the code in tag manager tag managers controlling the code think
10:17:12
about it that way and let's show you an example of what that looks like so here I am I'm in tag manager I just went to
10:17:18
tag manager.google.com and here I can see a list of tags so in our conversation
10:17:25
we're talking about tracking Facebook and we're talking about tracking Google analytics well Google analytics is easy
10:17:31
because it's a Google product so here if I look at all the different tracking code I have on my website through tag
10:17:38
manager let's just take a look at Google analytics so if you're going to use Tag manager you might as well put the Google
10:17:45
and analytics code in here so here I can see I have Google analytics as a tag in
10:17:51
tag manager now for Facebook if I'm running a Facebook campaign well I can
10:17:57
take that pixel tracking and put it in GTM as well and here I could see Facebook pixel that is that code is
10:18:04
added to GTM I just basically took what Facebook gave me and put it in a Google
10:18:09
tag manager so you can see I can add Facebook and Google analytics and again
10:18:15
I can't stress it enough any tracking code from any platform I can add to
10:18:21
Google tag manager in order to track the behavior from those sources so let's take a little bit deeper dive into how
10:18:29
tag manager works so I just showed you an example of how you could take Facebook and Google analytics code and
10:18:35
put it in the tag manager but if you're not familiar with tag manager then how do I do that well let's talk about the
10:18:42
structure and how tag manager works so when you have a tag man your account you have a container remember I mentioned
10:18:49
Toy Box earlier you have a bunch of toys if they're they're code and you're
10:18:54
tracking different bits of code from different platforms like Facebook think of those as toys and you have a toy box
10:18:59
okay well that's what this code is and that's what a container is the code is the code and that's going to go into the
10:19:06
toy box or container and so the way tag manager works is you have tags triggers
10:19:11
and variables so if I take my Facebook tracking code and put it into a container I need to set up a tag and a
10:19:19
trigger okay so let's take a look at what that is so first if I go back to tag manager I'm going to have an account
10:19:25
and if I have an account I'm going to have a container so here I'm just going to click on an account with a container
10:19:33
and a container is nothing more than what website you're adding the tracking code to okay that's all the container is
10:19:40
we're just letting tag manager know this is the website we're adding all this code too so you have tags triggers and
10:19:49
variables that's the structure of tag manager so tags are just what it says
10:19:54
tags what are we trying to quote unquote tag well if it's Google analytics that's
10:19:59
easy here I could see I have Google analytics added so if I click on Google
10:20:05
analytics here's my tag and if I take a little bit of a deeper dive there since
10:20:10
Google analytics is a Google product it integrates already with tag managers
10:20:16
it's pretty easy I can just choose Google analytics then I'm going to check page view and that's my tag now every
10:20:24
tag needs a trigger okay so I need to tell tag manager how or when to fire the
10:20:31
Google analytics tracking code so in this case I'm going to tell tag manager to fire on all pages so if I get
10:20:40
somebody a visitor to my website analytics is firing on all pages so whatever change that visitor lands on
10:20:47
Google analytics is gonna fire so that's really what it comes down to is I have a
10:20:53
tag and I need to tell tag manager when to trigger that tag that's really what
10:20:58
the structure of tag manager is it's tags triggers and variables and
10:21:04
variables we're going to talk about here in a couple minutes but do you have a piece of code you're going to go ahead
10:21:09
and put that into tag manager you're going to tag it and then you're going to fire that trigger so let's take a look
10:21:15
at another example here if I go back here you can see Facebook well here's my
10:21:21
Facebook pixel okay that's my tag so when is it gonna fire well it's gonna fire on a specific domain or subdomain
10:21:28
that's basically what we're doing we're trying to tell GTM when to fire that
10:21:34
particular tag so those are the three main components a tag okay which is
10:21:40
going to contain the JavaScript code that you get from say Facebook the
10:21:45
trigger so you're going to go into tag manager and tell tag manager want to fire that code that's the trigger and
10:21:52
then you have variables and so variables are basically just additional
10:21:58
information that tag manager may need for your tag and Trigger to work so
10:22:03
that's what a variable is it's there to get the tag and Trigger to fire so variables are divided into built-in and
10:22:11
user-defined variables so common used variables include say page path or page
10:22:16
URL or hostname or click class again they're there and these examples I just
10:22:22
gave you are there to get your tag and Trigger to work think about it that way they're just that's a component and if I
10:22:29
go into tag manager here and here on the left side I can see variables so
10:22:34
remember I have built-in and user defined so built-in means that tag
10:22:40
manager already built these for me so in case I need to get my trigger here to
10:22:46
work with my tag I can use a variable so those are built in and then I have user
10:22:51
defined so these are what I Define these are what I created and again the variables are there to get the tag and
10:22:58
Trigger to work okay so that's the job of the variable the job of the tag is to
10:23:03
host that JavaScript code okay in the case of Facebook or analytics that's
10:23:09
where we're putting our code so here if I click on AdWords remarketing again it's a Google product so I don't really
10:23:15
need to even deal with code I'm just going to select Google AdWords for marketing okay so you can see GTM
10:23:22
integrates nicely with some of the other Google products but let's just say you
10:23:28
have a Facebook pixel tracking code you're going to choose custom and you're going to put the code here so that's
10:23:34
part of the tag and then the trigger again is there to get the tag to fire so you're telling GTM when to fire the tag
10:23:41
and the variable is there to help you make sure that that trigger and that tag
10:23:47
work together so that's how all three kind of work together you need the tag to put the code you need the trigger to
10:23:54
tell GTM when to fire the tag and code and the variables there to help you define when that tag and Trigger should
10:24:02
work or how it should work so again review tags are they're just small codes of JavaScript are tracking pixels on
10:24:08
your website and so tags are allowed to manage events like scroll track and remarketing clicks downloads files play
10:24:15
buttons you name it even clicks on external links for example let's just say you have a click uh or a Facebook uh
10:24:23
icon on your site and when somebody clicks on it they go to Facebook you want to maybe track that you're going to
10:24:28
create a tag okay the trigger is there because you need to tell GTM when to
10:24:33
fire that tag so it's a certain condition whether it's you know fire the tag if the URL equals facebook.com or
10:24:42
some other condition so the tag cannot be created until the creation of the
10:24:48
corresponding trigger so tags and triggers go together you can't just create a tag and not have a trigger
10:24:53
otherwise your tag will never fire and then the variable is there again it stores the information when defining a
10:25:01
trigger or transferring data to tag so a variable has a variety of data okay so
10:25:06
you pick and choose the variable you want to use with that trigger okay so you're making sure that by defining a
10:25:13
variable you're making sure that you're telling GTM how that trigger should be
10:25:18
fired so let's take a look at another example here of how all three play together if I'm in this account I'm in
10:25:25
this container if I look down here I can see Google optimize that's another Google product so what I'm doing here is
10:25:34
I just chose Google optimize as my tag it's already integrated so what does
10:25:39
that mean I don't even need to deal with any code I'm just going to select optimize well we have the tag Google
10:25:46
optimize but we need to tell GTM how to fire that and so here we're going to
10:25:52
tell GTM to fire it on all pages so that's basically a very simple example
10:25:58
because we're firing it on all pages so if I want to look at something specific again Facebook here's my tag here's my
10:26:06
code what's my trigger well my trigger is it's going to fire on specific Pages
10:26:11
how do I know that well if I look at the trigger here I could see the trigger is
10:26:18
a page view but I'm telling it to fire on this particular hostname so the tag
10:26:24
and Trigger go hand in hand
10:26:41
so how to get started with tag manager so first things first you have to create
10:26:46
that account so you're going to go to tagmanager.google.com or you can do a
10:26:52
search for Google tag manager and you're going to create your account and then when you create your account what's
10:26:57
going to happen is you're going to set up a container and when you set up a
10:27:03
container you have choices so you could set it up for your website for an app on
10:27:09
iOS or maybe Android or you can even set it up for amp except an accelerated
10:27:16
mobile page so most people by default are probably going to set up tag manager
10:27:21
for their website and so when you do that when you actually select website what's gonna happen is you're going to
10:27:28
get some Google tag manager code in return and so the whole idea here is
10:27:33
you're going to do a swap what's your doing is basically you're saying Okay Google I'm going to take this Google tag
10:27:40
manager code and I'm going to put it on my website I'm going to put it on every page in my website so notice tag manager
10:27:48
has two scripts one goes in the head as high as possible the other goes into the
10:27:54
body tag as high as possible and so what you're doing is you're making a deal you're putting this tag manager code on
10:28:01
your website and in return every code you deal with whether that be Facebook or analytics or optimize or remarketing
10:28:09
or whatever it is is gonna go in GTM okay it's going to go into the Container you created so you need the tag manager
10:28:16
code on your website in order for tag manager to work okay so when you add
10:28:22
this code to your website then you're free to start adding all sorts of tags
10:28:27
to your container but if you don't have this tracking code on your website then none of the tags you add to your
10:28:34
container are gonna work so that's the idea yeah behind the container and then one thing I wanted to mention on the
10:28:40
account is it's a Google account so when you create your account then make sure it's the same account you use with say
10:28:47
Google analytics or some other Google product that's a good best practice is always use the same email address when
10:28:54
you set up your account so that it integrates nicely across all the different platforms meaning you can go
10:29:00
from say Google analytics right to Google tag manager in one browser without having to log out or log in okay
10:29:06
so when you create the account you're going to create your container if you choose web then you're going to be asked
10:29:12
to place code on your website and when you place that code on your website then you are free to start using tag manager
10:29:20
and that means you're free to start adding tags so if you want to know more information about installing Google tag
10:29:27
manager then what I would recommend is visit the quick start guide website of GTM so again if you're curious as to
10:29:35
where that code code is located in Google tag manager well when you create an account and you create a container
10:29:43
that container is going to have a specific ID so if I click on that specific ID here's where I can get my
10:29:50
code okay so again when I'm logged in to tag manager I'm going to click on
10:29:55
workspace but in the top navigation I'm going to see my unique GTM ID if I click
10:30:01
on that that's where my code is going to be located and so again your code needs to go in the header and there's another
10:30:08
script that needs to go in the body and if you're not sure how to add the code to your website well you can always
10:30:14
click on the quick start guide here okay and that'll take you to a quick start
10:30:20
guide page a reference page related to Google tag manager so let's talk about
10:30:25
creating a tag so once you get tag manager installed I'm sure you're
10:30:30
excited to get going and create that first tag so let's talk about how to
10:30:36
create a tag and tag manager so when you're in tag manager all you need to do
10:30:41
is basically you're looking at all your tags if you click on tag in the left side navigation you'll see all your tags
10:30:49
and there's a new button there so you just click new and so basically what you're going to do is you're going to
10:30:56
create your first tag and so what I would recommend once you get tag manager installed on your website I would
10:31:03
recommend setting the first tag up as Google analytics so that will get you
10:31:08
going with tracking page views on your website when some when somebody visits
10:31:13
your website okay so ideally that's what you want to do you want to get Google analytics as your first tag and tag
10:31:20
manager so what I'm going to do is because analytics is a Google product it's already integrated nicely with tag
10:31:28
manager so I'm just going to click on Google analytics it's going to be a page view that's what I'm tracking and now I
10:31:34
have to set up a variable and so what it's going to do it's going to ask me to
10:31:40
set a select a variable and so what you're going to do is you're going to select new variable and what you're
10:31:45
going to do is you're actually going to go and add your tracking ID here that's going to be your variable so where do I
10:31:52
get my tracking ID and analytics well if I'm in analytics I'm going to go to admin and then under property settings
10:31:59
I'm going to see my tracking ID and all you need to do then is go to tag manager and paste copy first you get a copy over
10:32:07
that tracking ID then you're going to get a tag manager and paste it and then that's going to create a variable for
10:32:13
you and then when you create that variable you're going to see it in the drop down here so I've already created it and basically that's your tag with a
10:32:22
variable then what are you going to do you're going to set up a trigger so see I have some triggers already set up
10:32:28
you're going to see a default trigger already set up for you and that's going to be all pages so ideally what you want
10:32:35
to do is you want to select all pages in order for analytics to fire on all pages
10:32:41
so that's what we're doing we're setting up a trigger we're basically telling tag manager hey if I get a visitor to any
10:32:47
page on my website then I want you to fire Google analytics so that's basically in summary how to set up your
10:32:55
first tag and my recommendation is your first tag should be Google analytics and when you set up analytics you're going
10:33:01
to have to set up a variable for the tracking ID and so you get the tracking ID again from admin property settings
10:33:08
copy and paste that tracking ID over save it you have your variable that
10:33:13
variable is going to be included in with the tag then your trigger is going to be all pages and there you go you have your
10:33:20
first tag you have your first variable you have your first trigger so that's basically what you want to do and once
10:33:27
you've added that tag once you've added that trigger then the only thing you need to do now is basically publish the
10:33:35
tag and so anytime you save a tag you're going to go ahead and submit it so that
10:33:41
way it gets published so again what you're going to do is let's take a step back here you're going to choose new tag
10:33:48
you're going to choose analytics from the drop down menu you're going to choose page view then basically you're
10:33:56
going to add your tracking ID so you can set up the variable and then basically that's what you need to do okay you're
10:34:02
going to add that tracking ID and then voila that's your tag with a variable and then once you've done that then
10:34:09
you're going to click submit so when you click submit you're basically saying Hey
10:34:14
I want this tag to go live now this tag and Trigger and once you've done that
10:34:20
then analytics is ready to go and anytime somebody goes to your website on any page tag manager is going to fire
10:34:27
Google analytics so the great thing here is you have something called Google tag
10:34:33
assistant and that's a an extension that works with Pro and so when you've
10:34:38
actually add a tag manager to your site or you have analytics running in tag manager you can confirm if those tags
10:34:45
are firing properly so let's take a look at how Google tag assistant works okay so if you just do a search for Google
10:34:53
tag assistant you're going to see here that it's basically just an extension that works in Chrome and unfortunately
10:35:00
it only works in Chrome browser it doesn't work in any other browser so go ahead and install that extension into
10:35:08
Chrome and when you do that you're going to see this nice icon here in your browser and now if you go to any website
10:35:15
and I click on Google tag assistant and I click on enable Okay so basically I'm
10:35:21
loading Google tag assistant and now once I refresh the page I can see that
10:35:26
this particular site has Google tag manager installed and not only does it have tag manager installed I can see
10:35:33
that it's also has Google analytics right running I have also Google optimize running and I have Google ads
10:35:40
remarketing tag running and tag manager so that's what tag assistant does it allows you to see if one tag manager is
10:35:49
on the site and if it is great what other tags are firing on this particular
10:35:54
site so tag assistance telling me I have these particular tags firing on that
10:35:59
site and they're firing within tag manager so tag assistant is a great way to confirm if one tag manager is on the
10:36:07
site and two what other tags are firing on the site now another way you could confirm if tag manager is firing on the
10:36:15
site is you can go into preview mode so even before you submit and publish your
10:36:21
tag and Trigger you can click on the preview mode so if I click preview in tag manager so basically that's going to
10:36:28
put me in preview mode and so what does that mean well that means that now I'm
10:36:34
free to go to my website right and see if those tags are firing and so let's
10:36:40
take a look at what that looks like so if I go to the website and just click refresh then what's going to happen is
10:36:47
tag manager is going to load in preview mode just as you see here okay so that's going to take a second couple seconds to
10:36:53
load up and now what can I see in preview mode I could see that I have GTM
10:36:59
firing but I also have some other tags found on this page remarketing I have
10:37:05
Google analytics I have Google optimize I have some other tags firing as well
10:37:10
and so the preview mode shows me what tags are firing on any given page and I
10:37:16
can also see what tags did not fire okay so here I have a number of tags already in GTM but they didn't fire on this
10:37:24
particular page so let's just say I clicked on the Donate Now button I'm still in preview mode so I'm going to be
10:37:31
able to see what tags fired now I could see I have a couple attacks bags that
10:37:36
have fired on this particular page and then I could see what tags did not fire on this page okay so that's the preview
10:37:43
mode you can use the preview mode before you even submit a tag and Trigger to see
10:37:48
if it fires and that's the great benefit of tag manager so if you're not sure if something's going to fire or not then
10:37:55
you can always go into preview mode um and if you are sure it's gonna fire then you can go ahead and submit it so you
10:38:02
can leave preview mode and just go ahead and submit that particular tag and Trigger so here I'm going to leave
10:38:08
preview mode and now once I'm done and I'm sure the tag is going to fire and go
10:38:15
ahead and submit all my changes that I've worked on in terms of setting up tags and triggers so that's really GTM
10:38:22
in a nutshell so I have my tags okay my tags are just Snippets of code that I'm
10:38:28
going to put in whether that be Facebook or vet tracking or any other Google
10:38:34
product like optimize answer page view then I have my triggers my triggers are
10:38:39
there to tell GTM when to fire that tag and the variables are there to help
10:38:45
those tags and triggers work together so remember that particular variable we set up for Google analytics okay so here it
10:38:52
is right here because we want to tell GTM what property to specifically fire
10:38:58
in Google analytics so that's why we set up that variable but there are all sorts of variables Google tag manager has
10:39:05
built in or variables already created for you or you can specifically Define a
10:39:11
variable so variables are there to help the tags and triggers work together so when you set up a tag you set up a
10:39:17
trigger you use a variable you can always go into preview mode preview it by going to the website seeing if it
10:39:24
fires if it fires then voila you can go ahead and click submit and that will
10:39:30
publish the tag and Trigger and you're good to go that's pretty much how tag manager works and again I can't stress
10:39:38
that there is an unlimited number of tags you can add to tag manager there's
10:39:44
no limit so you got everything from anything from Google to non-google to
10:39:50
event tracking okay to Facebook to anything that you want to track you want to be able to put into tag manager and
10:39:58
again there's versioning that's one of the great benefits of tag manager so if I want to go back to an older version I
10:40:04
can simply do that so here you can see I'm on version 32. that's how tag manager works and I can't stress that
10:40:12
you know tag manager is there to help you track interactivity on the site
10:40:17
because if you have a site that's interactive that has a video that has a download button let's just say you know
10:40:25

10:43:57
up Google analytics for account in detail in the upcoming videos let's
10:44:03
first identify which Google analytics property is associated with your website
10:44:09
in order to identify which Google analytics property you have login to
10:44:15
your Google analytics account now go to analytics account
10:44:21
and then open properties and apps here you can see properties for your website
10:44:30
now below the properties and apps several properties are listed where
10:44:37
you can see different IDs if the ID starts with UA and ends with a number
10:44:45
then you have a universal analytics property however if ID only has numbers
10:44:53
like here then you have Google analytics for
10:44:58
property we will learn how to switch the universal analytics account to Google
10:45:06
analytics score in the upcoming videos now that you have understood how to
10:45:11
identify Google analytics property let's take a detailed look at the comparison
10:45:17
of universal analytics data and Google analytics for data
10:45:24
the major difference between Universal analytics and Google analytics Port is
10:45:29
the measurement model Universal analytics uses sessions and Page views as the measurement model
10:45:36
whereas Google analytics score uses events and parameters as the measurement
10:45:43
model therefore any hit type from Universal analytics property say a page
10:45:49
view user timing Etc are captured as event in Google analytics for property
10:45:57
let's see the detail comparison of every aspect of universal analytics and Google
10:46:03
analytics port first we go with events
10:46:08
in analytics every measurable action for example page load form completion
10:46:15
Scrolls app installs Etc is measured as event and event has category label and
10:46:24
action in Universal Analytics moreover it has its own head type
10:46:33
in case of Google analytics 4 there is no categorization all the hit types from
10:46:39
Universal analytics are considered as events now let's find the comparison of
10:46:46
universal analytics and Google analytics for in terms of page views
10:46:52
page views is a metric to find that calculates total number of pages viewed
10:46:58
on your website now let's get a better understanding of page views
10:47:04
for instance when user lands on a web page of your site the page loads this is
10:47:11
considered to be a page view now suppose if user reloads the page
10:47:17
Google analytics tracks it as another page view if the user navigates to another page of
10:47:25
your website and returns to the same page this adds another page view to your
10:47:30
site now that you have understood page views let's see how page views differs in
10:47:37
Universal analytics and Google analytics port from Universal analytics page view
10:47:43
are translated to Google analytics for property as page view event
10:47:51
this page view event automatically gets triggered in Google tag manager the next
10:47:59
metric we have is sessions session is a Time duration for which user is active
10:48:06
on your website a universal analytics session May consist of multiple page
10:48:12
views events e-commerce transactions Etc
10:48:17
the session is considered to be ended if the user has 30 minutes of inactivity or
10:48:24
any other event for which session end is triggered in Google analytics 4 session metrics
10:48:31
are tracked from session start event which automatically gets triggered with
10:48:37
the basic interaction on your website however the session duration depends on
10:48:43
the period between the first and the last event now let's check our next
10:48:49
metric which is custom dimension in Universal analytics custom Dimension
10:48:56
add the information to the collected data whereas in Google analytics 4
10:49:02
information is added through the event parameters moving ahead
10:49:09
the next metric we have is content grouping content grouping in Universal analytics
10:49:15
allows to group content into a logical structure after which one can view and
10:49:21
compare metrics by the group name now talking about Google analytics 4 it has
10:49:27
predefined event parameter for Content group this parameter fills the data into
10:49:33
content group moving ahead the next metric we have is client ID
10:49:39
client ID is a unique string generated randomly and acts as a pseudonymous
10:49:45
identifier client ID identifies the browser instance and then it gets stored
10:49:52
in the browser cookies and therefore subsequent visits to the
10:49:58
same site are associated with that user in both Universal analytics and Google
10:50:04
analytics for client ID serves the same purpose that is the client ID is
10:50:11
responsible for providing the identifier now let's move ahead with the next
10:50:17
metric parameters parameters are associated with Google
10:50:24
analytics Port Properties understanding in detail about parameters
10:50:29
parameters are the chunk of information that specifies the user action
10:50:36
for example parameters can be passed to describe the value of the purchase next
10:50:43
we have is user property user properties provide information like
10:50:49
preferred language a geographical location of the users that interact with
10:50:54
your website or app now that we have seen difference between Universal
10:50:59
analytics and Google analytics four properties the question definitely arises can Google analytics really bring
10:51:08

10:54:34
biggies on the list thus Google analytics will continue to
10:54:39
be an important part of new business strategies so let's start with the keyword research
Top Free SEO Tools
10:54:47
so with keyword research tools you can do your job a lot more efficiently
10:54:52
finding the right relevant keywords I mean that's really key to SEO is finding
10:54:57
keywords that are relevant to your business product or service that you want to rank for so you want to be able
10:55:02
to choose keywords with high search volume and low competition so where do you get those numbers you get those from
10:55:08
certain tools you also want to get forecasts for certain targeted keywords you want to be able to generate a list
10:55:15
of latent semantic indexing type keywords keywords close to the keyword
10:55:21
you're trying to Target you want to be able to select primary and secondary keywords wisely so having a list of
10:55:27
keywords or certain data points will help you do that and you want to be able to identify the keywords that your competitors are also ranking for so good
10:55:34
keyword research tool will help you do all of those things so what are some of the the tools out there well look no
10:55:40
further than some of the free ones that Google offers like Google Trends so Google Trends is a good tool that you
10:55:47
can lean on if so if we look at Google Trends all you need to do is trends.google.com you can type in a
10:55:53
keyword I can look at the volume or interest of that keyword over time here I'm looking at football versus American
10:56:00
football and I could see how it's trending then I could see you know how it Trends in specific regions of say the
10:56:07
United States as my market I can also look at other related queries similar to
10:56:13
football or American football and so Google Trends is a good tool helps you look at the volume helps you look at
10:56:20
what specific regions helped you look at other keywords you know if you want you can simply just do a keyword search or
10:56:27
you can actually just see what's trending just by looking at the latest stories and insights so we could see
10:56:32
International women's day you know started to pick up steam is picking up more steam Etc so it's certain keywords
10:56:39
that tend to Trend well and you can pick up on what those keywords are using Google Trends now you could also use
10:56:46
another Google tool called Google Keyword Planner the only difference is this one's paid you need a Google ads
10:56:52
account so if we go into Google ads hey you'll need to go to tools and you need a Keyword Planner but when you're in
10:56:59
Keyword Planner you can find new keywords so if I type in for example you
10:57:05
know online marketing and click get started what the keyword tool is going to do is give me the data that I need to
10:57:12
do appropriate keyword research it's going to give me my keyword and similar keywords it's going to give me the
10:57:18
average month and volume and the great thing here is I can actually see the trend for that keyword over time just by
10:57:24
clicking on this little bar graph so for digital marketing I could see what the trend is over time I could see what the
10:57:29
competition is I could see you know if I'm going to bid on this keyword I could
10:57:35
see what the bidding range is so more important I could see the volume and I can see the competition here's my volume
10:57:40
for this keyword over the last 12 months on average and here's my competition so
10:57:46
Google's Keyword Planner gives you the necessary information you need to choose
10:57:51
relevant keywords wisely now there are other tools out there that are paid that help you look for Relevant keywords like
10:57:58
semrush or keyword finder that's a freemium tool so there are plenty of tools available to you you know another
10:58:05
tool I use that's not listed here is Moz so if you just type a keyword let's just type in the same keyword like online
10:58:12
marketing for example okay so what Moz is going to do is going to give me some volume it's going to give me some other
10:58:18
keyword suggestions okay it's going to tell me how difficult that keyword is and it's going to tell me who else is
10:58:24
ranking for that keyword so it gives me again all the relative information I need including competitive information
10:58:30
so you can use these two these keyword tools moz's freemium summer paint summer
10:58:36
free there's plenty of tools out there but these are the ones I would recommend for keyword research now let's turn our
10:58:42
attention to technical SEO so so for technical SEO you're going to need to use some tools there's no getting around
10:58:48
that because you want to be able to monitor how your website is performing I mean is it loading slow for example does
10:58:55
it have a lot of uh issues with the website in terms of server-side rendering for example or server response
10:59:03
time what about four fours and redirects so you want to be able to gather a lot
10:59:08
of the technical information that could Aid or prohibit your site from ranking so you want to be able to also you know
10:59:15
look at what the Bots are seeing and how they're viewing your website so if Google goes to crawl your site are they
10:59:21
experiencing you know a slow server response time were they experiencing Pages not found you also want to see if
10:59:28
you have a site map you know what's the site map are these Bots crawling your site or getting the pages from
10:59:33
assignment again you want to be able to lean on some of these tools to help you fix errors that you may encounter like
10:59:39
meta tags or four fours or canonicals so you need a good tool to help you manage
10:59:46
all that and so I'm gonna go back to Maz starting out so if we go back to Moz Moz is a good tool it's an all-in-one it's a
10:59:53
great SEO platform so if I go to Moz and I log into an account I can just go to
10:59:58
site crawl and so what Moz is gonna do it's gonna give me a lot of information about how Moz is bot is seeing my site
11:00:06
okay so if I go to the site crawl I can look at all the particular critical uh
11:00:11
issues that I've experienced so I could see four or four errors okay read a rex related to that I could see Meta
11:00:17
descriptions missing meta descriptions duplicate content so there's a lot of different issues that Moz is detecting
11:00:24
for this particular site and the great thing about Moz and this is why I use Moz as my SEO platform I don't work for
11:00:32
mods I've just used them a long time is if you do have issues then they give you ways to fix it so how to fix it section
11:00:39
so if I see missing description here if I just click on review and get a more
11:00:44
in-depth analysis as to what the issues are here but I can also click on the why
11:00:50
and how to fix okay and they're going to give you some information about how this is impacting SEO and what you could do
11:00:56
to fix the issue they lay out the issues pretty prominently here you can see for all the metadata issues I have I have
11:01:03
you know 142 total metadata issues I have 10 title tag two Longs I have 122
11:01:11
missing meta descriptions so they lay it out nicely here up the top so you can kind of get a sense of what to work on
11:01:18
and again they prioritize it based on the severity of the issue and then they break it down into several categories
11:01:24
for example I just looked at metadata issues you can see if I click on content issues I have some duplicate content
11:01:30
that Moz is recognizing or missing or valid H tags so Mazda does a really
11:01:36
really great job playing all all the issues out for you to recognize okay there's another tool that I like to use
11:01:43
called screaming from frog it's a pay tool so if we go look here great thing I like about a screaming frog it will
11:01:49
crawl your sight and it will give you some a list of issues just like Mazdas
11:01:55
of you know what it sees in your site is experiencing four fours broken links are
11:02:02
there any redirects it's picking up duplicate content site Maps you know their JavaScript issues how is it see
11:02:09
the site architecture so it really does take a deep look at everything that
11:02:15
could impact your website from ranking okay there are other tools out there like you know deep crawl or woo rank
11:02:21
they're both paid and so pay tools are really great as well it just depends on
11:02:26
you know your pricing structure what your budget is but really when it comes to all these tools they all more or less
11:02:33
overlap and do the same thing you just need to rely on one of them to make sure that you're able to see what the issues
11:02:40
are now there's nothing wrong with using two of them just as a second reference point to see if both are picking up the
11:02:46
same issue and of course I like to use search console I always like to lean on Google search console because that is
11:02:52
the source so search console will also you know give you some feedback on how
11:02:57
Google's bot is crawling your site so that's under the crawl error section here so you can also you know use search
11:03:04
console to upload a sitemap so that's a key to SEO you want Google to be able to
11:03:10
find your web pages quickly so you can simply just signify to Google where your
11:03:16
site map is located so the search console does a lot more gives you some HTML improvements gives you some
11:03:22
backlinking uh and then the process of updating the search console user interface so there's a new user
11:03:29
interface that you can use with Google search console the great thing is it's free and it has everything you need to
11:03:35
know about your website and how it's affected by SEO organic search the only
11:03:40
thing you have to do with search console is verify the site but once you verify it has all the relevant information you
11:03:46
need so let's talk about backlink monitoring and Analysis okay so this is
11:03:51
related to off-page SEO so you're going to need a good tool to help you monitor
11:03:57
your website backlinks and backlinks are simply just links from external sites
11:04:03
pointing to your site and you need to keep an eye on what sites are linking to yours are they spammy related sites are
11:04:10
they good at relevant sites or anything in between so you need to really be able to analyze what the good links are what
11:04:17
the bat links are pointing to your website and you can also you know given the tool also perform some competitor
11:04:23
analysis so you should be able to use a tool to be able to compare how your site's ranking against your competitor
11:04:30
okay you want to measure the ratio referring domains to backlinks so how many pure domains are linking to your
11:04:36
site so you want a tool that's going to be able to tell you that you want to identify and disavow Port back links
11:04:42
okay so you want to be able to to recognize what sites are linking to yours that's actually hurting you from
11:04:48
an SEO standpoint and you want to be able to do something about that okay you want to measure citation flow and Trust
11:04:53
flow you want to check the ratio of Link distribution in terms of is it internal or external or you know what kind of
11:05:01
sites are linking to my site are they you know social related are they pure
11:05:06
content related and then you want to be able to track the number of do follow and no followings you know how many
11:05:12
links pointing to our site are actually telling Google and other Bots not to
11:05:17
follow the link or how many are actually allowing the Bots to follow that link if a bot follows a link it's going to pass
11:05:24
what we call link juice so you're going to get credit for the backlink if it's a no follow you're not going to get credit
11:05:29
for the backlink and we want to be able to measure that and so we want to have tools that will help us do that so what
11:05:34
are some of those tools well hrefs is a good tool it's a pain tool Majestic is a
11:05:40
freemium tool Moz again Moz is the tool I use SCM rush and then again I gotta
11:05:46
mention Google search console so let's take a look at some of these tools in terms of backlink monitoring and
11:05:51
Analysis so let's start with Google search console again it's free you just have to verify your site and so if I go
11:05:58
to Google Search console I can look at links and I can see what external links
11:06:03
I have pointing to my site okay so I could see I have 17 000 in this example
11:06:09
pointing to the home page of this particular site okay so if I click on that I can see all the the top sites
11:06:16
pointing to my home page now from an off-page SEO perspective do you want
11:06:21
every backlink or external link pointing to your home page no so you want links pointing to internal pages so you want
11:06:28
to be able to measure that so I could see with the top linking sites are and I can also see what the anchor text is so
11:06:34
do what I want my anchor text always to be my brand name no I want it to be you
11:06:39
know keyword we're trying to Target search console also gives you some internal links okay what of top link
11:06:44
Pages for internal links so from an SEO perspective you always want to have a nice balance of internal linking so this
11:06:51
report helps you understand what pages are getting links and are the links evenly spread so this is Google search
11:06:57
console this is the links report this is totally free this is provided by Google all you have to do is verify your site
11:07:04
now if we go over to Moz we type in a domain any domain so I just typed in simple and learn okay Moz has some
11:07:12
metrics that are important to off-page SEO including domain Authority so the higher your domain Authority the better
11:07:18
off you are and so what helps a domain Authority grow is how many quality links
11:07:24
are pointing to that domain and so here we could see over 7500 linking domains to Simply learn so
11:07:31
what's important is we just don't want any site we want quality relevant sites
11:07:36
pointed okay so we could see how many total inbound links and then how many ranking keywords we have okay so here is
11:07:44
going to give me kind of an idea of what my domain Authority has been over time they're going to tell me the top
11:07:50
followed links to this site so they can tell me you know what are those links pointing to my site and what's the page
11:07:56
authority of those sites okay here I can get a nice graphical breakdown of the
11:08:01
linking domains by domain Authority so you want pages with high domain
11:08:06
Authority pointing to your site so here I can see 69 linking domains between 91
11:08:12
and 100 so that's really good we want High relevant domains linking to our
11:08:18
site so just like search console I can see the top anchor text being used okay and I can see the top pages that have
11:08:26
you know good page Authority on the side I could see following versus no follow on internal and external links so this
11:08:34
is just the overview so Ma's really really does break down for you you know
11:08:39
what those pages and linking domains are so if I just click on linking domains now I could get a detailed look for my
11:08:45
home page what domains are pointing to our domain so I can see microsoft.com
11:08:51
has a domain authority of 100 YouTube 99 and so not only does Moz provide you
11:08:57
with the domains it also provides you with their domain Authority score and spam score so you want to keep an eye on
11:09:04
any particular site that has a high spam score so having a site with a high spam
11:09:10
score and a low domain Authority will hurt your domain and Page Authority for that page so Mazda does a great job of
11:09:17
breaking it out and this is for any page it doesn't necessarily have to be the home page okay if I take a look look at
11:09:23
another example here Majestic so Majestic again I can use a free version of the tool they have their own metrics
11:09:29
citation flow trust flow so when they say trust flow what's the link quality all about okay citation flow what's the
11:09:36
link volume and they can get an idea of how many external backlinks are pointing to the site and what's the trend end on
11:09:44
that referring domains so Majestic does a really good job again some of the same
11:09:49
metrics that we could see here except they go into detail about languages as well so this is majestic and you got
11:09:56
search console you got a lot of other tools and then I'm going to just revert back to Moz because you want to be able
11:10:02
to compare link profiles if you're in a competitive space and you're doing off-page SEO you know Moz will help you
11:10:09
compare how your site stands against maybe another competitive side or
11:10:14
relevant site so just doing this analysis I can compare my domain Authority spam score how many total
11:10:20
links you know how many external file links or external no follow links a
11:10:25
breakdown of linking domains so it does a nice job of comparing one site versus
11:10:32
another that's going back to Moz and that's what you want you want a good tool that's going to help you do that I
11:10:38
mean there's other tools out there not listed like bright Edge that will also help you compare linking profile so at
11:10:44
the end of the day if you're doing off-page SEO you want to get a sense of what sites are linking to yours are they
11:10:50
quality sites are they spammy what anchor text are they using are they no follow are they do follow you know are
11:10:57
they top domains how do you compare against your competitors I mean all these metrics are related to off-page
11:11:02
SEO so you want a good tool that's going to help you measure this okay so let's talk about rank tracking so when we do
11:11:09
keyword research we're looking for Relevant keywords we find our relevant keywords we sign primary and secondary
11:11:16
keywords to Pages we optimize those pages we do off-page SEO and we do an all this work for SEO okay we want to be
11:11:23
able to measure the fruits of our labor we want to be able to measure how we perform for on and off page SEO for the
11:11:30
keywords we covet in the pages they're related to and so that's where rank tracking comes into play so we want to
11:11:36
be able to track our website's ranking and not just our website all the pages we've optimized we want to be able to
11:11:42
measure our click rates and Impressions we want to be able to track the ranking for both desktop and mobile for specific
11:11:50
locations and we want to identify top performing gaining and losing keywords
11:11:55
so in other words we want to look at Trends is a keyword ranking is it going up and ranking is it going down and
11:12:01
ranking if it's going down in ranking then you need to take action so you need a tool a good tool for rank tracking so
11:12:08
we can look no further than again Google search console it's free it's right from the source so let's take a look at what
11:12:16
Google search console has to offer in terms of rank tracking so if I go to Google Search console and I put in a URL
11:12:23
what it's going to do is it's going to give me and this is the search queries report it's going to give me what
11:12:29
queries people have used to actually type into google.com and it's going to be able to tell me how many times my
11:12:36
pages show Pages showed up for that query it could be more than one page so that's an impression and if I did
11:12:43
receive an depression meaning did my page show up in the organic listing then did I get a click as a result and so in
11:12:50
this case if I got 68 Impressions and 10 clicks for keywords somebody typed in that's a 14.7 percent click through rate
11:12:57
and so with search console we'll also do is say hey look for that particular keyword you appeared on average in
11:13:03
position 4.1 so it gives you really good insight as to you know what people are
11:13:09
typing in and how you're being found for those keywords it breaks it down by Pages it breaks it down by country
11:13:15
breaks it down by device so I could see you know mobile I've had 899 Impressions over the last three
11:13:23
months on mobile and I received 33 clicks as a result my average position on mobile is 2.6 so search console does
11:13:31
a really good job again this is free information uh providing you the actual
11:13:36
keywords somebody's using on Google search as a query and how many Impressions you're receiving for that
11:13:42
keyword how many clicks click click the rate and then average position so in theory the higher you are positioned on
11:13:49
Google the more clicks you're going to receive so if I'm not positioned properly for keyword let's say page two
11:13:55
then I'm probably not going to receive as many clicks as I would like so that's search console there are other tools out
11:14:01
there like hrefs again does a good job of tracking AMZ tracker we look at
11:14:06
wincher so there's some good tools out there I'm just going to show you another one again I'm going to go back to Moz
11:14:13
for example so Moz has a tool called so if I go back into the account so Moz has
11:14:19
a rankings tool that you can look at to see where your keywords are ranking so if you've already chosen keywords and
11:14:27
optimized Pages for those keywords then you want to be able to load those keywords into Moz and so Moz allows you
11:14:32
to do that and so what Moz does they do a crawl once a week and they'll be able
11:14:38
to tell you where you rank for all your keywords are we moving up in the rankings are we moving down how many
11:14:44
keywords do we have ranked between positions one and three eleven through twenty four through ten twenty one through fifty so we'll be able to see
11:14:51
where our keywords Rank and so it gives you a breakdown here of nationally in
11:14:56
the United States where this keyword is ranked and if it's moved up or down and for what URL is it ranked for and so you
11:15:05
can label soak the keywords and and this is what you want to look for in a good tool you want to be able to organize
11:15:11
your keywords and label them so for all our brand keywords we want to be able to label them branded because ideally you
11:15:18
don't want to optimize for your brand keywords so maybe we want to exclude our brand keywords and look at our non-brain
11:15:23
keywords in terms of ranking and so you can certainly add locations and look at specific locations the whole idea
11:15:29
between a good ranking tool is to be able to measure you know if a keyword is
11:15:35
trending up or down okay so I can simply look at a particular keyword and I can see the trend of that keyword and then
11:15:42
you know if a keyword is not ranking then we want to wonder why it's not ranking well is it difficult is it not
11:15:48
ranking because of its difficulty or can we do a better job of optimizing for
11:15:53
that keyword and so Moz also has a page optimization tool so if you're not ranking for keyword you can flip over
11:16:00
the page optimization tool then put in the keyword put in the URL and mods will
11:16:05
give you some idea as to what you can further do to optimize the page okay so that's Moz you know this is hrefs so you
11:16:12
can see ahrefs does the same thing they provide you some visibility average position how much traffic you know where
11:16:19
you're ranking in terms of positions one through three four through ten eleven through fifty and so you want to be able
11:16:26
to get a sense of where my track keywords are trending are they trending up are they trending down and the whole
11:16:32
idea again Beyond a ranking tool is if you're trending down you want to be able to address why it's trending down so you
11:16:39
want to start with on-page SEO can we do a better job of optimizing in or off page does that page need more backlinks
11:16:46
so that's why you need a backlink tool to support your ranking and ahrefs does offer up some competitor information as
11:16:53
well so you can see how your competitors are performing so these are some good examples of ranking tools that you could
11:17:00
take advantage of now there are also a few important SEO tools that can be helpful in different ways for example if
11:17:07
you're doing video so there are some tools to help you measure how you're performing via video for example vid IQ
11:17:15
so let's take a look at vid IQ so if I load in say video in YouTube in this
11:17:21
example how to rank YouTube videos I have a vid IQ extension loaded into my
11:17:27
browser in Chrome and so now I can get a good eye sense of how many views the
11:17:32
duration the engagement rate the like ratio how many people shared it on
11:17:37
Reddit but further I can look at how the video is optimized so they're telling me
11:17:43
the title's too long here maybe shorten it up but we have tags we have descriptions we have cards we have end
11:17:49
screens it's been shared on Facebook it hasn't been shared on Twitter okay it is public we do have pinned comments and we
11:17:56
do have hearted comments and so this gives me an idea of how we did in terms
11:18:02
of optimizing this particular video okay so if we wanted to tweak it we could tweak the title tag make it a little bit
11:18:08
shorter to help it rank better on YouTube so you want to be able to use a tool like this because if you have
11:18:15
videos then you want those videos to rank and so you can certainly watch this video on how to rank your YouTube videos
11:18:21
and in that video we do allude to vid IQ so you want to be able to use a tool
11:18:27
like this because you know YouTube it is a video portal but it's the second largest search engine behind Google so
11:18:33
if you do have videos you want to be able to rank for them and you want a tool that's going to help you measure
11:18:39
and help you understand if you are ranking if you're not ranking why are you not ranking now for Content
11:18:46
optimization there are tools you can use like SCS site checkup or site analyzer
11:18:52
are some good tools if you already have Moz as an example just going back to Moz
11:18:57
as you already know I use mozz a lot so they have a page optimization so you
11:19:02
could check the content and how you're optimized your content so it's going to give me some good feedback on you know
11:19:08
is your page title meta description are they in line okay so it's going to give you some good feedback on that you also
11:19:16
have again I have to allude to search console you can always look at a particular page in search console see if
11:19:22
it has any errors as well so is it duplicated meta description is it a duplicated title tag is it any Pages
11:19:29
missing title tags or meta descriptions so when it comes to content you can look at search console you can lean on Moz or
11:19:36
you can lean on some of these other paid versions like site analyzer when it comes to traffic and metrics look no
11:19:42
further than and Google analytics there is a free version of Google analytics as well as a paid version so if I go into
11:19:49
Google analytics it's going to tell me all of my website Behavior okay who's coming to my site how they got to my
11:19:56
site how they behaved once they went to my site and are they achieving the goals
11:20:01
I set out for them to achieve via conversions and so you want to look at first in Google analytics how much
11:20:08
traffic you're getting so if I go to Google analytics if I go to acquisition all traffic channels I should be able to
11:20:15
see how much traffic organic search is driving over a period of time so I can
11:20:20
see how many users how many sessions then if I click on landing pages I can see what landing page they went to so I
11:20:26
could see the home page over a particular time I had over a thousand sessions I can also see engagement from
11:20:33
organic search are they bouncing how many pages are they looking at in this session after they landed on a
11:20:39
particular page are they staying on the site a long time what's the their duration or are they achieving any goals
11:20:46
so analytics will provide me all that information about how organic search as
11:20:51
a channel is performing the other thing about Google analytics I like and that goes back to the technical aspect of SEO
11:20:57
and that's site speed so if you go to behavior and you go to site speed overview you'll be able to see how my
11:21:05
pages are loading what's the average load time so they'll break it down for you by browser by country and by
11:21:11
specific page so if I look at page timings I'll be able to see what page is
11:21:16
loading slow what page is loading quick compared to site average and so the great thing about analytics is if I have
11:21:22
a page that's loading slow compared to site average they'll actually provide me with some suggestions so if I go to site
11:21:29
speeds and speed suggestions what they're going to do is they're going to have a link in the report that's going
11:21:34
to allow me to click on it and I'm going to be able to see what suggestions they can provide so when this report loads
11:21:41
I'll be able to see what this speed suggestions are for my pages so here I
11:21:46
could see the page I could see what the average load time is of that page so for example this particular page is loading
11:21:53
at six seconds ideally we want to have you know three seconds or under maximum so if I just click on this link here
11:22:00
they're giving me six page speed suggestions so if I click on that I'm gonna go to another Google tool called
11:22:06
page speed insights and then page speed insights is going to run for both mobile and desktop for this particular page and
11:22:13
then this page speed insights report is going to give me feedback as to what I
11:22:18
need to do to speed up the load time of that page so here you can see for desktop and mobile they're going to give
11:22:25
me some suggestions and opportunities so reduce the server response time properly size images serve images in next-gen
11:22:32
formats so all these will shave off time off my page load time and so that's
11:22:37
what's going to help me speed up the page load and that's page being insights you can get to from the speech
11:22:44
suggestions report and analytics so in theory the higher page load time your
11:22:49
chances of ranking on Google organic search diminished so Google wants pages
11:22:55
that have very low page load time that load quickly so Google analytics is
11:23:00
great tool for Speed suggestions it's a great tool for finding out what the traffic is doing on your site how
11:23:06
they're engaging and are they achieving goals now there are other tools out there from an organic perspective like
11:23:13
keyword it that's a good keyword research tool for Reddit so if you go to keyword it you'll be able to see from a
11:23:20
Reddit perspective what keywords are driving volume these are just the results but you can put any keyword in
11:23:26
there and get the results of that keyword with tough competition to rank on the

11:26:32
some companies hiring for significant roles under SEO are Microsoft Disney
11:26:40
's udemy and Deloitte there's questions for you okay so the first question that you
SEO Interview Questions And Answers
11:26:47
might be asking interview is differentiate between do follows and no
11:26:52
follows okay so if you take in or listen to my SEO courses on YouTube for SEO we
11:26:59
we talked a lot about do follows and no follows and and simply put I mean do
11:27:04
follows are just signals to the search engines to follow the link so there's a
11:27:09
link on site a pointing to site B we're gonna basically tell Google Bing and
11:27:15
some of these other search engines hey go ahead and follow that link now I know file is just the opposite so no follow
11:27:20
link doesn't allow the search engine crawlers to follow it so if we have a link on our site site a pointing to site
11:27:28
B we could put a nofollow tag in there and what that's going to do it's going to signal to the Crawlers hey don't
11:27:36
follow this link so in the end of the Crawlers don't fall follow the link then there's not going to be any link juice
11:27:43
passed and so Google is not going to give you credit or give that site credit
11:27:48
for having a link pointing to it or pointing to another site or from another
11:27:54
site and so it's all about linking so we can control if there's links on our site
11:27:59
whether we want the Crawlers to recognize those or not simply with no
11:28:04
follow tags so just a reminder link juice is the reputation or Equity pass
11:28:09
from one website to another so if you have a link on another website and that
11:28:15
website is of high quality meaning their page Authority their domain Authority is high they have a lot of content you know
11:28:21
they're not spammy they're really rich and they're relevant then you may want to make sure that the link pointing from
11:28:27
that site to your site is a no follow so that way that Google can recognize the link from that site to your site and
11:28:34
basically that reputation is going to be passed on to you okay so that's a do follow versus a nofollow and why would
11:28:42
we do a no follow well it just pens it really depends a lot of social media
11:28:48
platforms like Facebook have no follows if you have a lot of content you may not want to be pushing out a lot of do
11:28:54
follows it could actually look bad from an external linking standpoint and so a
11:28:59
lot of sites are really particular about who they want to pass link choose onto and give credit for the link so it's a
11:29:06
business decision at the end of the day there's really no hard fast rule here except from an SEO perspective if I have
11:29:13
a site and I have a lot of external links pointing outward to other sites I'm going to be particular about who I
11:29:20
allow the search engines to follow and what links I allow not to follow okay so here's an example of what they look like
11:29:26
so do follow is simply just the href notice the nofollow has the the tag
11:29:32
appended to it the href tag with a nofollow so if the search engine's
11:29:38
crawling your site and they say that no foul there they're not going to follow that link and vice versa if there's a
11:29:44
link on another site pointing to yours and there's a no follow there you're not going to get credit the search engines aren't going to pick up that link okay
11:29:50
so question two what is 301 redirect and how is it different from a 302 redirect
11:29:56
so 301 redirects tell users in the search engine specifically that an
11:30:02
original page has been moved and this is the keyword here permanently so permanently moved we're going to explain
11:30:08
that in a minute so it's just moved from one page to another and so if we don't
11:30:14
have a page anymore we have a new page let's just say you built a new website with new URLs you want to make sure the
11:30:21
old page is pointing to the new page with a 301 redirect so for 301 redirect
11:30:28
is permanent then a 302 is temporary so we want the search engines to recognize
11:30:35
that we have 301 permanent redirects in place why because if we we have
11:30:40
temporary then it might alert Google to not keep that page in its search engine
11:30:47
rankings because it's temporary so why would Google want to keep a temporary page or even a page that is pointing to
11:30:53
another page on a temporary basis so they may remove both pages from its
11:30:59
index okay but if we have something permanent in place Google may say okay this page is permanently linking to
11:31:06
another page or redirecting to another page therefore it's stable it's
11:31:11
permanent we're going to keep that new page in the index and eventually remove the old page so really something
11:31:17
permanent is more stable in the eyes of the search engine something temporary may not be as stable in the eyes of say
11:31:24
Google and if they don't see it as stable then they may remove both pages from the index okay so the idea is we
11:31:31
want to be found in Google search index and we get it sometimes Pages go away for a variety of reasons and if it does
11:31:38
go away just make sure you having a new page for it and that new page is a 301
11:31:43
permanent redirect okay so question three why are backlinks important in SEO
11:31:49
well we kind of hinted on that a bit with the nofollow because if we have a link from another website pointing to
11:31:56
ours and that link from that other website is really relevant and and it
11:32:01
has a high page and domain Authority then it's going to benefit us and so backlinks are important because if we
11:32:08
have backlinks from quite quality sites it's going to improve the credibility of our site especially if it's a do follow
11:32:15
tag so the search engines are going to recognize the relationship between the site that has a link pointing to us okay
11:32:22
so it's just going to build our credibility it's going to increase increase our domain Authority and then
11:32:28
the net effect of that is if we're credible and we have high domain Authority then that's going to increase
11:32:35
the rankings of our pages and when the pages increase in ranking then we're
11:32:41
going to get more of a Lion's Share of the traffic for certain keywords that our pages are found for and if our pages
11:32:48
are found in getting traffic then because we have increased rankings we're likely going to have increased traffic
11:32:53
and then it's just a snowball effect so more traffic leads to more engagement and conversions so the whole idea for
11:33:00
SEO is remember you have an on-page strategy and an off-page strategy building external links is part of an
11:33:07
off-page SEO strategy and we want to make sure that you know we are relevant
11:33:13
in the form of a link or in the form of content on other high quality sites being on a high quality site only
11:33:19
benefits us because again increases their domain Authority Google sees this is more relevant therefore pages are
11:33:26
going to benefit by ranking higher and therefore when we rank higher we get more traffic so it's a snowball effect
11:33:32
so having bad links is important because it snowballs all the way through to
11:33:37
conversions okay so what are the best practices to rank your videos on YouTube
11:33:43
this is a great question really great question given the importance of videos especially with SEO because videos are
11:33:50
found YouTube in itself is a search engine so if we have a video how are we going to get it to rank on YouTube well
11:33:56
first things first you never want to put a video out there and want it to rank if it's not engaging or informative so make
11:34:04
sure you go ahead and follow the best practices of having engaging and
11:34:10
informative content in your video now once you have that video in place you want to optimize it and then some of the
11:34:17
key factors for optimizing a video are you want to choose a title that has high
11:34:22
search volume and low difficulty just as you would keyword for example for web page you want to choose a title with a
11:34:30
keyword in it that has high volume and low difficulty IE low competition okay so you want a nice ratio there and you
11:34:38
know what you want to choose a title that's going to get people to watch the video too so it's not all about just
11:34:43
choosing a title just for the sake of high volume you also have to choose something that's relevant that's going
11:34:48
to be catchy as well and then with that title goes the description so you want a description that's very relevant to your
11:34:55
title okay because most people aren't going to click on a video just for the sake of a title they're going to want to
11:35:01
probably get a sneak peek via the description of what it is so again you want to optimize that description but
11:35:07
make sure the description is is just as snazzy as the title okay you also want to use accurate and relevant video tags
11:35:14
just as you would on Twitter Facebook tag these videos okay so make sure your
11:35:20
title tag length doesn't exceed 100 characters because it will get chopped off so again that goes back to just
11:35:27
writing something really short and to the point that's going to grab somebody's attention Okay you also want
11:35:33
to upload a captivating thumbnail something that's relevant then that's gonna grab somebody's attention and then
11:35:40
again we set it similar to the video tags we want to use relevant hashtags again just as you would with Twitter and
11:35:47
Facebook go ahead and throw some hashtags in there that people could see because people search via hashtagging
11:35:52
and then this goes without saying you did all the work created a really great video it's engaging it's a formative you
11:36:00
optimized it feel free to promote your video on other social media platforms
11:36:05
okay don't just stick with YouTube per se so the benefit here is if you post it
11:36:11
on Facebook or LinkedIn or whatever platform of your choice and it gets engagement people click on the link go
11:36:17
to YouTube they're gonna like it and then other people are gonna see that engagement they're gonna see how many
11:36:23
people liked it or how many subscribers you have so promote your videos to help
11:36:28
you with the ranking of the video on YouTube so that does play into it so go
11:36:34
ahead and promote it so other people can watch it like it comment Etc and then
11:36:39
that's going to engage other people to want to do the same so what is mobile first indexing this is a really
11:36:46
important and timely question mobile first indexing means Google's just using
11:36:51
mobile friendly content for indexing and ranking websites so in other words
11:36:57
Google for example has two Bots they have the traditional desktop bot and
11:37:02
they have a smartphone bot and eventually everybody that has a website is going to be migrated over to the
11:37:09
smartphone bot and so with that smartphone bot goes to your website and starts crawling what do you think they're looking for their smartphone bot
11:37:16
they're looking for mobile friendly content if it's not mobile friendly meaning the page isn't designed for a
11:37:24
smartphone browser or let's just say the images are way too large or you have to
11:37:30
expand the text just to read it you know a lot of these these issues that somebody would have just simply trying
11:37:37
to read something on a web page on their MO mobile device Google's not going to grab that content so you want to make
11:37:43
sure it's mobile friendly so it gets indexed and so if your website has a responsive design Google will rank your
11:37:50
website based on its performance on mobile devices okay so you want to make sure that your website is mobile
11:37:57
friendly and if you're in an interview and somebody asks you this question you could even take it a step further and
11:38:03
say look I'm going to measure how friendly my wall my website is for mobile devices and Google search console
11:38:09
because Google search console has a report that will show you what pages on your website are not mobile friendly and
11:38:16
it's not a guarantee but I could tell you if I'm Google and I'm crawling your site with my smartphone Bob and that
11:38:23
page or one of my pages is not mobile friendly I'm probably not going to index it or rank it so you want to leverage
11:38:31
that report in Google search console to see what pages are mobile friendly so
11:38:36
that's a little bonus for you to really impress press the interviewer who asks
11:38:41
you this question because how are you going to know if one of your pages is mobile friendly or not if you don't look at a report so keep an eye on Google
11:38:49
search consoles mobile usability report okay number six list down the most
11:38:54
important local SEO ranking factors okay so organic local ranking is just as
11:39:02
important as anything else in organic search because if you have a local business you want to use the likes of
11:39:10
say Google my business to show up when somebody types in you know looking for a florist or you're looking for a coffee
11:39:17
shop so what you want to do is you want to create a web page for every product and service okay you also want to opt
11:39:24
for your business listings on Google my business and and there are plenty of other local business directories out
11:39:32
there like Yelp for example or Bing even has one so go ahead and also make sure
11:39:37
you have a business listing as well but since Google in the United States has a huge market share you want to start with
11:39:43
Google first you want to update your nap citations on your website maintain
11:39:48
consistency of your nap okay so nap is name address phone number so you want to
11:39:56
make sure that that's current and consistent so if you have a number on your website make sure it's the same
11:40:02
number on Google my business okay you can embed a Google map on your website it could certainly optimize The Meta
11:40:09
tags and content not only on your web pages but within your Google my business directory so you can add your business
11:40:15
to other local directories like I mentioned Yelp and then also just as
11:40:21
important opt for reviews and ratings okay so the more reviews The Hat you have the better off you are okay so I
11:40:28
always say this with the with local search three of the main factors in showing up for local search on say
11:40:36
Google is obviously the keyword the second is the price proximity of where that person is and then third is the
11:40:43
reviews so you can't really control the proximity but you can't control the keyword and you can control the reviews
11:40:50
to some degree so work hard at getting reviews for your business but at the same time you can certainly work in some
11:40:58
keywords let's just say for your product and service pages on your website but also you can translate that over to
11:41:04
Google my business okay so working in those keywords making sure your your
11:41:09
number your address your name they're all consistent and and really just
11:41:15
spreading your the the business out on other directors that's really all these are really key factors for local SEO
11:41:22
okay so question number seven how to avoid duplicate content getting
11:41:27
penalized for duplicate content so for example if you have two different versions of a web page you may result in
11:41:34
a duplicate content issue so it's just SEO 101 you never want to have two two
11:41:39
or more pages with the same content so what do we do well we can avoid this in
11:41:45
having Google penalize us by again setting up a 301 redirect remember three
11:41:50
or ones are permanent we can also use what they call canonical tag and a canonical tag basically alerts the
11:41:57
search engines as to which page is the original okay so if we have an original page we want to point to that page with
11:42:04
a canonical tag and the third option is opt for preferred domain and Google search console okay so if you have
11:42:11
multiple no names make sure you set up a primary one in search console so those
11:42:16
are ways to work around it of this three I would always go with the canonical tags because that's just a tag that's
11:42:22
going to sit on the page it's going to alert Google as to what the original is just in case they get their hands on the
11:42:29
duplicate so all the pages that have the same content are going to have the same canonical tag pointing to one page so
11:42:35
again three ones are permanent you could simply just redirect one to the other if
11:42:40
you end up having duplication or you could just tell the search engines hey this is the original page or you can go
11:42:47
through search console okay number eight what are the tactics to increase a web
11:42:52
page speed okay so what are some of the tactics well when you build a site especially for mobile you want to keep
11:42:59
it as simple as possible and what I mean by simple as possible really I mean hey use a simple website design don't get
11:43:06
overly creative if you will most websites all websites have images you're not going to be able to get around that
11:43:12
but just make sure you optimize your images in other words don't have such a large image size if you don't need
11:43:18
something very large don't have it okay you want to improve server response time and what do we mean by that well your
11:43:24
site's sitting on a server somewhere you can own that server or you can be renting it out from say Amazon web
11:43:31
services or let's just say GoDaddy as your register they also have web hosting
11:43:37
well if you have it on say GoDaddy server you may be sharing that server
11:43:42
with other businesses and at certain times of the day other businesses may get a lot of traffic and suck up a lot
11:43:49
of bandwidth what is that going to do that's going to reduce the server response time for your site and so you
11:43:55
want to make sure you have an idea of you know what server your web page your
11:44:00
website is on and you want to be able to have some control over that because if your server response is slow that's
11:44:07
going to slow down everything else in terms of loading in the browser and that's not going to be good for SEO okay
11:44:13
optimize your code what do you mean by optimally minifying when we see mimifying we mean get rid of some of the
11:44:20
Redundant code if you have CSS you know get rid of chop some of the get rid of the JavaScript you're not using so
11:44:26
that's what we mean by optimizing code reduce redirects okay ideally you just
11:44:31
want to have one redirect in place you don't want to create a daisy chain so to speak of redirecting and redirecting
11:44:38
after that that's Never Gonna bode well and it's going to slow things down as well enable browser caching so if you
11:44:45
enable browser caching basically if somebody comes back to the page they've been on say two days ago they're
11:44:51
probably going to see a cache version of that page and then off for the content delivery Network as well so these are
11:44:59
some of the ways to reduce page speed now if you're curious about the page
11:45:04
speed of your website you can always go to Google's page speed insights tool and
11:45:10
all you have to do is just Google page speed insights or even just something generic like Google page speed and
11:45:17
you're going to get this tool page speed insights and all you need to do is just plug in a URL when you plug in the URL
11:45:23
Google is going to analyze the URL for both mobile and desktop and so here we
11:45:28
could see Google gives a score so we can see the score from low ball and we can see the score for desktop just by
11:45:34
clicking on desktop and so here I can see some of the issues that the site may
11:45:40
be having in terms of page load time for their desktop if I flip over to mobile
11:45:45
you know here I can see some other issues for example they have a server static assets with efficient cash policy
11:45:53
now if you're not sure what the heck that means you can always just click on it and you can see some specifics here
11:45:59
and where you can just always Google it as well uh here you got to reduce the impact of third-party code okay so
11:46:06
that's another thing uh reduce JavaScript execution time so again going
11:46:11
back to a lot of some of the comments we made about coding okay so sometimes too much code or code not functioning as
11:46:18
well as it should we'll tend to slow down the site okay so you can use page
11:46:23
bin insights you can always get a glimpse of how pages are loading simply by also going to for example Google
11:46:31
analytics under Behavior okay you can go to site speed and if you click on
11:46:36
overview okay Google what go Google does is they do a sampling of pages over time
11:46:42
and in this case based on 89 Page views they have an average page load time and
11:46:50
so you can get a sense of how quick specific Pages load or your site overall simply by looking at the site speed
11:46:57
overview report in Google analytics to get a sense of how quick your pages are
11:47:02
loading now there are certain factors that do affect load time so obviously
11:47:07
the way the page is built with the code the images Etc but also the browser each
11:47:13
browser loads differently okay so you want to take a look at it by browser also by country every country has a
11:47:19
different network you can be in the United States and have worse network
11:47:25
service than you do say in you know Ivory Coast in Africa okay so it really
11:47:32
depends on the network you're on so and also the page every page is built differently so you want to get a sense
11:47:38
of what pages are loading quicker and which pages are not you can simply just go to page timings and Google analytics
11:47:46
you get a sense of what pages do not load fast and which ones do and maybe hone in on the pages that aren't loading
11:47:54
fast and address those pages first okay so you have two tools at your disposal one Google analytics and one page speed
11:48:01
insights okay so let's look at question number nine here so when should an
11:48:07
individual Target short tail and long tail keywords okay so remember short
11:48:13
tail are usually one to two keywords very Broad in nature long tail keywords
11:48:18
or maybe three four keywords in a query or maybe an entire sentence those are
11:48:24
considered long tail keywords so usually short tail keywords have higher volume
11:48:29
but also higher competition longer tail keywords usually have lower uh volume
11:48:35
but also lower competition but the great thing about long-term of keywords the conversion rate will tend to be a little
11:48:42
bit higher than say a short tail because it's less vague and more specific so you
11:48:47
can use short tail keywords if you're trying to drive a lot of visitors because those keywords are going to be vague or Broad in nature long tail
11:48:54
keywords are used for targeted Pages such as product pages and articles so if you have a specific product with a long
11:49:01
name you can certainly optimize that page for that product name again the
11:49:06
product name may have low volume but if somebody types in exactly that product name you show up the chance of you them
11:49:14
converting are going to be very high so you don't have to always be that specific at the product name but try and
11:49:19
be as specific as you possibly can in order to get somebody to click on your link in the search engine results and
11:49:27
get them over to your site to convert okay so those are really the big differences short tail very broad very
11:49:33
vague a lot of volume but also a lot of competition but hey if you're ranking for sure short tail keyword you're
11:49:40
probably going to get a lot of traffic the conversion rates may not be as high as something say long tail where hey
11:49:47
maybe you're just honed in on a few set number of products and you're not care
11:49:52
you don't care a lot about the traffic you just care about getting the relevant traffic to your site to convert okay
11:49:59
number 10 what are they Port elements to focus while developing a website so
11:50:05
we're talking in terms of SEO okay so if somebody asks me this question in an interview what am I going to focus on
11:50:11
while developing a website well the answers are right here yes we talked about mobile mobile is so important
11:50:18
because a lot of websites are going to be indexed with Google smartphone bot so
11:50:23
mobile usability is very important so we need to make sure our website is responsive for mobile just some basic
11:50:30
practices when it comes to site architecture navigation we want to have a simple URL structure okay no overly
11:50:37
cumbersome the navigation should simply be clean and neat okay if you have five products okay maybe you have uh in your
11:50:45
navigation you have something called products with all five listed or you have all five products in the main navigation the key is you just want to
11:50:51
make it clean and neat and easy for somebody to find the the rule of thumb is if it's good for the end user
11:50:57
probably gonna be good for Google but if complicated for the end users probably going to be complicated for Google you
11:51:03
always want to create a site map now what is that sitemap a site map is simply just a formatted file with two
11:51:09
that includes all your URLs and assets your images and your videos they're going to be sitting on your server as
11:51:15
well so you want Google or these these Bots to be able to find your pages and
11:51:21
assets and by the way you want to take it a step further and make sure you upload that site map which is sitting in
11:51:28
the root directory meaning domain.com sitemap.xml okay you want to take that
11:51:34
site map and make sure you input that site map location in Google search
11:51:40
console that way Google search console has a one-way ticket to grab the
11:51:45
elements in the sitemap another important element to focus on while developing a website is having a robot's
11:51:51
text file and all the robots text file is it's like a lock I always say to a house so if you lock a door in your
11:51:58
house nobody's going to be able to get in that door so it's all a robots text file is you're telling Google and these
11:52:04
other Bots that are coming across your site what's locked and what's not locked meaning what they have access to what
11:52:10
they don't have access to so you want to be able to make sure you have a robot's text file if you're trying to non-index
11:52:18
specific pages of your website because if you tell Google don't crawl these Pages or this directory they're not
11:52:25
going to get crawled if they don't get crawled they're not going to get indexed so robots text file is an important
11:52:30
element to focus on while you're developing your website and while you're developing your website it could be on a
11:52:36
you know in a directory just called new web website so you probably want to have new website as the directory in the
11:52:43
robots text file and just to let Google know don't go into this directory
11:52:48
because it's my new website I'm not ready to go live yet so you don't want it indexed so there are a lot of reasons
11:52:54
to have robots text files that's the main reason sitemap you want Google to
11:52:59
get these pages and assets quickly okay you want to make sure that your site
11:53:05
architecture navigation is in order you want to make sure your site is mobile friendly and you also want to make sure
11:53:12
you have content on your website that's the key because that's what's going to keep people on the website and engaged
11:53:18
and when I say content I don't necessarily just mean words I also mean videos I also mean images you know
11:53:25
something interactive okay you want to keep people engaged that's the key behind it trust me if if an end user
11:53:32
finds your site engaging Google is likely going to find your site engaging okay so those are good brownie points to
11:53:39
bring up if somebody asks you this question in an interview so just a quick recap here it's important to have a
11:53:45
better site structure so the Bots can easily access into next content okay with a responsive design helps to make
11:53:52
your website mobile friendly and user friendly would also increase the amount of time a user spends on your website
11:53:58
which may improve your site's ranking sitemap is simply just a file that helps search engine Bots to understand the
11:54:04
structure of the website okay how many pages are on your website and where they located along with the videos and images
11:54:10
okay and then the robots text just instructs the search engine Chrome dollars to understand what pages should
11:54:16
not be indexed okay this is simply just a text file and it's added to the root directory again think like a door think
11:54:22
of a lock okay you can tell you can lock whatever doors you want in your house then give it that way I hope this course

--------------


the end of this video, these are all the things you will learn and know how to execute. For full transparency, my intention here is to provide you with as
0:48
much value as possible so you know how to do your own SEO with the hopes that should you want to get a little bit more
0:54
serious and want more support, you come and join us in our premium community. All the assets that I'll mention will be available for free inside our free
1:00
community and I'll leave a link to that in the video description below. Let's get started. First, I want to get started by ensuring that we all
SEO in 2025
1:06
understand what is SEO in 2025 and what is this landscape look like and why it's
1:12
important to you. And I think the best way to start this off is by answering the question that I get probably on a
1:18
daily basis. And that is, is SEO dead? Which is a fair enough question. The simple answer here is absolutely not.
1:25
But it is evolving and this complex answer of how it's evolving is what we're going to answer at the moment and
1:31
why it's still critically important for you to understand and execute correctly.
1:37
I think the change can be summarized in this slide here. It may seem very simple but the consequences of this change are
1:44
huge. And essentially that is that the tools we used to go on the internet before were search engines and now
1:53
they're no longer search engines. They are answer engines. They're also called generative engines by the way. Go. And
2:00
essentially to understand the difference is that before the goal or when you used to go to a search engine, you would type
2:06
a keyword. For example, how to do SEO and Google or the other search engine would bring you the first link in which
2:13
you would find your answer or it would suggest the best link for you to go through and then yourself find the
2:19
answer. Whereas the answer engines or the generative engines, they do the crawling for you from the highest
2:26
quality sources, mostly everything in the first page of that search result, read everything and summarize and give
2:32
you the answer for you. Right? That's the main fundamental change. I'm sure you've done that. And whether that's with Google AI or GPT search or
2:39
perplexity, you've had this experience already, which means a couple of things. One is that there are a lot more options
2:45
now. This tends to be a good thing for the end user. But we have Google AR overviews. We now have GPT search. We
2:52
have Plexity, Claude, Codeilot. Essentially, any large language model with access to the internet is something
2:58
that we want to optimize for. Now, it needs to be said that Google has its own
3:04
search engine. Obviously, Google. So, that's what Google AI overviews and Google AR mode is using. GPT search
3:10
should be using Bing, right? The Microsoft search engine. And then Perplexity and Claude, they all have
3:16
their different things. I'm not actually quite sure what Claude is using. So, we kind of need to optimize for different search engines as well.
3:23
Now, this is great, but what does it actually mean for us? And really,
3:29
fundamentally, it means the traffic is down, right? And this is just the new reality. There's no sense in panicking
3:37
and pushing that red button and giving up, but this is just the new reality. the traffic is going to continue going
3:43
down probably as well. This is a screenshot from a website that used to
3:49
be getting probably the second most amount of traffic in the world and it was HubSpot's blog post. They were
3:54
getting close to 10 million visitors per day and now they're down 87% down to 1
4:00
million visitors a day. You can imagine for a big business like that that is really going to hurt their bottom line.
4:06
So if it's happening to them, it's probably going to happen to you and other people there. Now, there's always rules to this exception. There's always
4:11
a a website that slips through the cracks and is doing well for some reason. But for majority, traffic is
4:17
down and it's going to continue going down. And really, it's because the goals
4:22
have changed here. So, the old goal used to be that one blue link that was ranking number one. Meaning, the old
4:28
goal used to be to be the destination, right? The click. So, therefore, success
4:34
also meant clicks. How many clicks are you getting? But now the goal has changed. The new goal is to be the
4:41
source to be trusted by the search AI search engines enough that they use your
4:46
information to site their answers. Right? So success means now being that
4:52
topical authority figure and being everywhere so that when the user is ready to make that transaction, you are
4:57
there. So now it's changed again. The old goal used to be to be the destination. The new goal is to be
5:04
cited, to be the source. Throughout your journey, you've probably already seen different acronyms to this
5:11
new landscape of SEO. AI SEO, AEO, LLM SEO, GEO. You might have even heard me
5:17
say it. And my whole point here is do not get confused. This is all just SEO.
5:23
Whilst they all might have different meanings, they're all just SEO. SEO isn't dying, but it is evolving as we've
5:29
demonstrated already. So you also need to understand that you can't do these
5:35
without doing SEO. Right? There is a difference tiny bit in GEO from SEO. But
5:41
trying to do one of these ones without doing SEO is a little bit like saying I don't want to learn how to swim. I just
5:48
want to learn how to do butterfly stroke. You know what I mean? Like you just can't do one without the other. So
5:53
whilst yeah, this is a new kind of game here, they're all fundamentally still just SEO. So don't get caught up about
5:59
it. So then how do we actually optimize for AI search? Well, we're going to go
6:05
through this in detail, but what I want you to understand is that the old
6:10
pyramid of SEO can be fundamentally kind of based in these four little uh
6:16
sections. Now, they can be named different things, but fundamentally to
6:21
do good traditional SEO, you need good off-site SEO and good content, good backlinks, and good on-site SEO. And
6:27
there's a lot of little sub things within each of these boxes, but I think that can be a really good summary of
6:32
what makes good SEO. And all we need to do is realize that the top of the
6:38
pyramid has changed and there's an extra step, and that's AI SEO. But we still can't rank in the AI search engines
6:45
without doing all these other ones. It's just not going to happen. And if you think about it, it kind of makes sense,
6:51
right? The AI search engines, whether that's AI search from Google, GPT or Plexity, they go shopping for their
6:57
sources in the first page for that search term. It wouldn't make much sense for them to go digging for the third,
7:04
fourth or fifth page of that search result for their sources. That's not trusted sources. So, you still need to
7:10
do the work and you still need to rank in traditional SEO to even be considered to rank in the AI overviews and be cited
7:18
analysis which will form the strategy. People love to overcomplicate keyword research. I think the more simple you
Research & Strategy
7:25
keep it, the more useful it's going to be for you, particularly when you're starting. So, to do keyword research, we
7:31
need a couple of things. Obviously, we're going to use AI to help us organize all this. And I will give you a
7:36
prompt below for that. But really, we need an SEO tool. Whether that's a Hrefs, SEM Rush, you take your pick. But
7:42
all those can get quite expensive. For this tutorial, we're going to use
7:48
data for SEO. It's high quality data, but also it's a pay as you go program,
7:53
meaning that you put some credits into it and if you don't use it, you don't pay for it. So, it's not another
7:58
subscription that you have to worry about it. And in my opinion, it is extremely cost effective. And when you
8:03
sign up with the link below, you're going to get $5 free credit to use this tool with a Google Sheets add-on, which
8:09
is more than enough for a lot of research that we need to do. Definitely more than enough to follow along with
8:16
this tutorial. So, the first thing you need to do to start your keyword research journey is create an account
8:22
with data for SEO. I'm going to log in. And when you sign in with the link below, you're either going to have $1 or
8:27
$5 here. If you don't get the $5, you can reach out to their support here and
8:33
make sure they give you those $5 free credit. Now, two things we need to be able to use data for SEO. Don't worry if
8:39
it looks very complicated. We only need a couple of things here. You need the API login, and you also need your API
8:45
password. You'll have to get that sent by email and save that little password code. Next thing to do is to start a
8:53
brand new Google Sheets. And you're going to want to go to this link, which
9:00
is a Google Sheets connector with data for SEO. One of the reasons why this program is so cost effective is because
9:07
they don't have a pretty interface, but they still have high quality data. And I think that's a nice trade-off. So, I'm
9:13
going to try this for free and it's going to take you to this data for SEO API connector. You're going to install
9:19
it and then when you go back to a random Google sheet, ideally a brand fresh one.
9:24
Once you go to extensions, you're going to see data for SEO connector, you're
9:29
going to start that and it's going to take a while and it's going to build this template in which you'll be able to
9:35
do not only keyword research, competitor analysis, and a lot more things. Here
9:40
with this popup, you're going to say yes, insert pre-made templates. Now, with the template all set up, let's just
9:47
navigate it a little bit so you don't get too lost. It might look confusing, but trust me, it isn't. So, at the
9:52
bottom, you have these new tabs. So, you see here, keyword search intent, keyword difficulty, Google search volume, Bing
9:59
search volume, keyword suggestion, similar keywords. And if we click on the right scroll right uh arrow, you'll see
10:07
that we've got a bunch more things, right? The kind of API calls here that allows you to do are very very varied
10:15
and very very good. There's a couple of things that you need to understand that when we use one of the tabs, so let's
10:20
say we want to use for example, one of my favorite ones is uh keyword
10:25
suggestions or keywords. We want to place the click the tab here and we want
10:30
to make sure that in the right hand menu from data for SEO we look for keyword suggestions. So keyword suggestions and
10:37
now I'm in keyword suggestions. So the tab at the bottom in the right hand menu need to align otherwise this won't work.
10:44
That's the only tricky or clunky thing of this. But to do free keyword research with high quality data I'm happy to pay
10:51
that tradeoff. Right. So we're going to grab a website here. This is someone from our community that we're going to
10:57
help them out with a bit of keyword research and analysis. So, they do uh a line, they do mortgage approvals, I
11:04
think in Michigan, right? And we're going to go into website structure and all that later on, but I just want to
11:09
simplify keyword research. Keyword research is the thing that I find people to over complicate. So, my t intent here
11:15
is to really keep it simple. We're going to be trying to find two main keywords. Transactional keywords andformational
11:21
keywords. Now the transactional keywords are search terms with buying intent.
11:26
Meaning if a user is searching with these keywords, they're probably ready to make a purchase, submit a lead,
11:33
whatever that might be as you can see here. Whereas theformational keywords
11:38
are search terms where people are looking to learn, they're looking for information, they're looking to compare. Now technically there is more
11:44
definitions for different keywords, but that doesn't really matter for now. And the purpose of these keywords as opposed
11:50
to the transactional ones are to build topical authority because we want to write about everything that we know
11:55
about and to get a little bit of traffic if it's possible. Right? So those are the different kind of keywords
12:01
transactionalformational keywords. That's what we're going to be finding now. So you've set up your
12:09
you've set up your data for SEO. You're all ready to go. And you can see here I've kind of done this in advance. One
12:14
of the main things that we start we're going to try to find is one of the services they they provide is home equity loans. So we want to find the
12:20
transactional keywords that are these ones here. And those are the ones that we're going to make sure we have in that
12:27
page because that's our money page, right? You'll see what I mean in a second. So what we want to do is grab
12:34
our sheet. And in our sheet, like I said below, you need to make sure you have the extension enabled. You can go back
12:39
to this sheet. I'm going to go start here. And what I want to find here is the similar keywords.
12:45
That's the first thing I want to find. So what I would like to do is make sure
12:51
that I've got some keywords for home equity loan. Right? That is really the main thing, the main keyword that we
12:58
want to try and find some more information about. Want to copy that. We want to go back to
13:04
data for SEO and we want to place that in there. We want to place that in there. The location in this instance is
13:10
the United States and English. Um, the rest is fine. Now,
13:17
the number of suggested keywords, I want a bit of data here. So, I'm going to go all the way up to 80. Um, and then on
13:24
the right hand side, I need to find the same similar keywords, but in this drop
13:30
down here. So, I've got here similar keywords. Perfect. Similar keywords and
13:35
keyword suggestions are very much the same. I just prefer similar keywords for some matter. There is a different
13:41
definition, but you get kind of the same things. Anyway, so now that I've got that selected, I'm going to hit run. And
13:47
if I scroll a little bit to the right, you'll see that this will update in a second with ideally 80 keywords that we
13:54
can start kind of seeing. So here, home equity loans. Let's see.
14:02
Home equity loan rates. beautiful. So, uh, what I'm going to start trying
14:07
to do now in the keyword suggestion as well, I'm going to do the same thing to
14:12
see how many keywords we can find here. You can see that we get a little bit of different data. So, keyword suggestions,
14:19
home equity loans. I've already done this one. Perfect. Okay, great. So, now
14:26
in this one here, let me actually do it with you. So, home loans. Uh, number of suggestions. Let's
14:32
go 80. So, we get a bit more. And I'm going to make sure up in the right hand menu, I've got keyword suggestions.
14:39
I think keyword suggestions are a little bit more loose in terms of loosely related where similar keywords have to
14:45
be more similar. I think now I remember the definition. Again, I don't like to over complicate this things. Let's see
14:50
if I can find more than 80 keywords here. It might not. Perfect. That's all that it found. So, I'm happy with that.
14:57
So, I think this is the section where people get stuck. They go, "Great, I've got all the keywords. Let's go through
15:02
the data and see what it means." Before we even get to the data, I want to make sure you understand that whether it's
15:09
the SEO tool data for SEO, AHES, SEM Rush, whatever you're using, they're not
15:15
an absolute source of truth. Meaning, they're not 100% correct. You should use them as a guide, not as an absolute
15:22
source of truth. I say this because sometimes people search for a certain word in their location and they say,
15:27
"Oh, it's got zero to 10 search volume following. It doesn't make sense for me to go for it." That tends to be rubbish.
15:33
And if you think that that keyword makes sense for you to go for because you know that people are searching for that because you know your niche better, then
15:39
optimize for that keyword regardless. It's a quite a good strategy. Zero search term keywords that a lot of
15:45
people go for. But anyway, so again, just a guide, not an absolute source of truth. So now um looking through here
15:52
you want to do a general analysis to understand. So these are the suggested keywords. This is the estimated monthly
15:58
search volume that the keyword produces or that search term. Competition index.
16:03
Uh I don't like that data set. What I like more is a keyword difficulty. CPC
16:08
is cost per click. So this is a great data set to understand. If I rank number one for that keyword and I'm getting,
16:15
you know, let's say a thousand clicks every month for home equity home loans
16:21
and if I do the quick maths here and I go uh 17.32 * 1,000, then I would be spending
16:29
$17,320 for the same to get that same amount of traffic if I was running ads for it. It
16:36
kind of gives you a really good understanding of why SEO can also be so damn cost effective when done correctly,
16:41
right? Now, the keyword difficulty is a really good one. That's understanding how difficult the keyword is going to be to
16:48
rank for. The higher the number, so the closer to 100, the more impossible it's going to be to rank, and the lower the
16:54
number, the easier. So, for example, here is one that's really good. Chase home equity loan has a zword keyword
17:01
difficulty. Now, I know that's not exactly true because Chase is actually a bank in the United States, so you have
17:07
to have a bit of common sense here. Here's one that is incredible. So, home equity agreement,
17:14
right? So, the agreement itself, that keyword, for example, might be a bit of
17:19
a gold mine because if the keyword difficulty is null, meaning zero, but
17:24
the potential search volume is 14,800 search volume, amazing. That is going to
17:30
be a good keyword. If I offer home equity agreement, I don't know if that client does to be honest, but if they
17:36
did, I would say, hey, we need to do a page, a transactional page around this
17:41
and then anformational keyword or supporting pages around this. And actually, I'm going to select that one
17:47
for later because uh we're going to do content around that so I can show you how to write supporting content for
17:53
that. So, I'm just going to highlight that different color. And what you want to go through is do
17:59
this exercise. See if there's any little golden nuggets that might have really low competition. Uh US Bank Honey Loan
18:06
that makes sense for you to go for. This one's not a bad one as well. Discover home equity loan rates commercial. So
18:13
you might have a list of different home equity loan. Um
18:20
eight. Yeah, I really like going through this because sometimes you just find absolute gold mines of zero search or
18:26
zero low difficulty and high search volume. It's not to say that you
18:31
shouldn't go for the high search volume keywords, but if you're starting out, if it's a new website, try to start with the lower hanging fruit. By that, I mean
18:39
the keyword difficulty is low. Even if the search volume is low, the thing is here, you're not looking for all the
18:44
traffic. You're looking for the right traffic. People get shiny object syndrome with like this keyword because
18:50
it's got 16,000 estimated monthly search volume. Sure, but maybe not all the
18:55
traffic that you get from that because it's quite broad is going to be good for you. Anyway, I've fluffed off on enough
19:01
about that. So, this is great. What do I do with these keywords? We're going to get into this one in a second, but what I want you to do is go to chat GBT.
19:07
We're going to use our trusty tool here. And in the resources, I have um gotten
19:14
this ready for you guys, which is just a prompt that's going to help you do a bit
19:19
of segmentation right away for those keywords. And by that, I mean just organize this mess of keyword data that
19:25
we got into a bit of actionable plans, right? So, I'm going to place this prompt in here. And then I'm just going
19:32
to give it the data. And because GBD5 is so dense smart, you
19:38
can just copy and paste the dirty big data that we got from before. And it'll do a pretty lovely job in organizing all
19:44
this. So I want to get all these ones here. Perfect. And I want to copy this so it understands uh the data a bit
19:51
more. I want to paste that. And what I'm going to do as well is paste the other stuff here. Go to similar keywords. And
19:59
making sure that I've got this one as well, cuz these are all similar. I want to make sure that we've got that. And
20:06
you see it's got the data between commercial andformational. We've instructed it to kind of segment those
20:11
and tell us where to use which one. It'll make sense in a second. So the prompt the data for that money page. So
20:20
for the home equity loan, right? And let's go to GPT. And now it's
20:26
going to ask us to clarify what this data is all about. The more context you
20:31
give chatbt in this instance, the better it's going to do. All right, so here it's asking clarify the business type
20:37
and primary cycle. So let's just go to the website. Um,
20:45
so get home loan approval in Michigan. I think these guys are in. So the business
20:50
focuses in helping people getting home loan approvals in Michigan. This is going to be uh centered around for one
20:57
of the services pages about uh equity loans. I want you to Yeah. And that's it
21:03
actually. Um and
21:09
the rest is this is a service business and the primary goal is to get leads.
21:19
It is to get leads and become the topical authority.
21:28
Now, GPT5 uh fast is more than enough for this. I've just set it in auto because we're
21:34
not doing rocket science, right? We're just doing SEO. People say, "I need the smartest model for this. I need Gemini
21:41
2.5." You don't. You really don't. This is more than enough. And you can see here, it's doing such a good job, at
21:47
least in my opinion, at organizing everything for me. So, I've got the main page here. The target keyword is going
21:52
to be home equity loan and then the title is home equity loan in Michigan. You see, because we've given it the
21:59
context of, hey, we're doing some keyword research for this website that offers this service in this location,
22:05
it's already giving us really highly optimized titles for this. I might have
22:10
a subpages of home equity loan calculators. Those type of pages are not only going to get you good traffic, but
22:16
potentially good backlinks. We'll touch on backlinks in a second. And then it's also given me some articles. So I can
22:23
already start writing articles which we'll go through in a second as well. Right. So for the main page of home
22:31
equity loans, I can go back to um this here. So main page I want to do a tab
22:38
here. Uh home equity loans.
22:46
Loans. Perfect. And I'm just going to paste the
22:53
data the GPT gave me. I can already start here. And this sometimes is enough
22:58
for you to get started for a client or for yourself because you know your main pages, the subpages that you might want
23:04
to build, and you have the starting blog articles to go with. All right, I think this is pretty pretty good already. So
23:12
again, these are the main things you want to place in that uh the main services page. to target keyword. Some
23:18
of the H2Os need to be home loan equity home loan rates, best home equity loan rates, equity home line of credit rates,
23:25
and HELOC versus home equity loan because it seems that a lot of people are looking for that and that's a transactional keyword. I trust that
23:32
makes sense. So, we've done a quick keyword exercise and we've already found
23:37
the transactional keywords and some of theformational keywords. Now, the second part of this keyword research section is
23:43
going to be about finding all theformational keywords you ever need. And before we found a bit of a golden
23:49
nugget, right? We found a keyword that had low s competition but high search
23:54
volume. Now I don't really know what home equity agreement is to be honest. It's outside of my my expertise. But
24:02
let's say they offer that service home equity agreement. So one, I need to build a page around that. So I could do
24:08
the same keyword research for example on grabbing this home equity loan and
24:14
putting that as the main keyword and just seeing what comes up as well. Uh
24:20
keyword suggestions. Yeah, keyword suggestions just to see if it's actually got the right data set and I want to
24:26
find well maybe there's other golden nuggets related to that keyword. Uh let's see.
24:33
Uh yeah, cool. also home equity investment, a lot of keywords. Pretty
24:39
good. So, I've got a lot of related ones that are that have got a lot of search volume and little competition.
24:46
Um, yeah, little competition, null chase equity loans, home investment, pros and
24:54
cons. That's a great article that we could write about, but I'm getting ahead of myself. So, I'm going to grab the main keyword as well, home equity
25:00
agreement, and I'm going to use one more tool. Again, this is a free tool or the premium version is more than good
25:05
enough. It's called answer Socrates. And the purpose here is to find every single
25:10
frequently asked question about home equity agreement. And there's going to be a lot of questions about that because
25:15
with a topic like this, people really want to do their research. So, you want to make sure that you are in every
25:21
single part of the journey for the user. So, anyway, I've done the main keyword and the topic, the country, the
25:26
language. I'm going to hit search. This will be linked below. There's a lot of tools like this, whether it's um
25:34
answer the public uh and uh people also ask, but I really like answer Socrates
25:40
at the moment. So, all of a sudden, I've got a total of 558 questions related to
25:47
this keyword. And the idea here is one question equals one blog post that you answer in detail. There's one extra
25:52
feature this tool has uh to cluster the keyword. and it uses a large language
25:59
model to cluster the keywords into questions that are very similar because some of these questions are very similar
26:05
as you'll see in a second. But it has one more feature that I really like. So for example, if I answer the
26:12
question, are home equity agreements a good idea? And if I click on this, the
26:17
cluster for these types of questions that are very similar to one another can
26:23
give me a potential uh search volume of 710, you know, traffic or search volume,
26:28
sorry, a month if I rank really well for that. And I just like that kind of um
26:33
assessment there. So cool. I've got, you know, potential, you know, ideas to
26:40
write about and to become the topical authority figure. So, what I want you to do is download the clustered topic. Next
26:47
thing is to start a new Google sheet. And I'll show you why in a second. And
26:53
we want to file. We want to import the CSV file.
26:59
We're going to upload this bad boy into here. And the way that they've formatted is really nice. So, uh, insert into,
27:08
uh, replace kind of spreadsheet. Doesn't really matter. I'm going to import the data.
27:13
So this already makes a incredible spreadsheet
27:22
for your content. Right? So what you would do here is maybe do one more
27:28
column where you see that if you've written this cluster name where that would be the main keyword you're going
27:34
for and then you want to have that any variation keywords in here that particularly have some search volume and
27:40
you have this H1's H2 and you're answering that. We're going to go through how to create highquality um
27:45
content in a second, but already this is all the blog posts that you will need
27:50
for a while. Now, not all of them are blog posts. For example, home equity
27:56
agreement sharing Reddit. All right, these are people that are going straight to Reddit. This already tells me that a
28:02
good strategy could also be them as a subject matter expert just answering
28:07
questions that people are asking about this field in Reddit, right? And that might be a little bit of a slug, but
28:14
it's also a good idea to build some reputation there. you people asking this thing about Kentucky in South Carolina
28:22
uh reviews. Yeah, I mean there the opportunities on content is kind of endless. So, one
28:28
thing that I like to do here is I'm just going to copy the link for this.
28:34
And in the original blog articles, what I can do um is what was the keyword
28:42
here? Home equity agreement. Yeah, home equity agreement.
28:49
I can also do target keyword home equity
28:59
agreement and I can go command K which will allow me to paste a link to it. And
29:05
now I've kind of done the majority of the research for this keyword for home
29:11
equity agreement because I can click on that and go oh yeah that's right or I need to write some content. Let's pick three, four blog posts and write about
29:17
those. And I would recommend you do that for as many keywords that are related to you.
29:25
So, how are we going to structure this and everything? Don't worry, we're going to go through that later down the track. But I think this is in my opinion the
29:34
new age of keyword where you really want to find the questions that people are asking so you can answer them. Keyword
29:40
stuffing is not really working so much. is about adding value, which we're going to go through in the next section.
29:47
Before we move on to competitor analysis, which is really important. I know for some of you this might seem too
29:53
simple, but trust me, the simplicity works here. We found transactional keywords. We found all theformational
29:59
keywords we could ever want. Leave it there. Don't over complicate things. The next thing we want to do within this
30:05
research, and you'll understand why it makes sense looking at this together, is competitor analysis.
30:10
What we're looking at here is the estimated traffic they're getting. More importantly, the keywords they are
30:16
ranking for. Because sometimes it's no use trying to do everything ourselves
30:21
and discover these hidden keywords when maybe our competitors are already doing a good job. Why not leverage the work
30:27
they are doing? I often find this that gives me some really, really good opportunities and ideas that I wouldn't
30:32
have thought about. I just need to replicate it better than the competitors are doing. So, we're going to use the
30:38
competitor analysis to find some keyword gaps and then really prioritize the quick win that we want to get for these
30:44
guys. So, how do we do competitor analysis? Again, to go along with our keyword research, I've done another tab
30:50
here, done competitors. And all I need you to do is maybe select three, four competitors that you know you are
30:56
competing against, and put it in this really easy to understand sheet. Again, don't over complicate things,
31:02
particularly when you're starting out. Keep it simple, stupid, as the saying goes. And that's really is my preference
31:07
and I find a lot better performance when you do that. So, I've just done a quick search and I know that this is one of
31:13
the competitors. I'm going to put the URL in there. Uh I want to go to this one as well.
31:21
Okay. So, I want to put our uh client or our website. I'm just going to change
31:27
the color of it because I think it's good to put it um just differently so you can see it a lot easier. So now we
31:32
want to find out the estimated traffic the competitors are getting the back links how many keywords they're ranking
31:39
for and we can even go a step further and understand what are those keywords we're ranking for. So again we're going
31:45
to use our main data for SEO uh sheet and we need to click on the right score
31:53
right here because we want to understand the organic traffic estimation. So
31:58
that's the first thing we need to do, right? We want to find, well, what's the monthly estimated organic traffic that
32:04
they're all getting? Again, this is estimated search traffic. This is probably going to vary quite a bit in
32:10
like if we were to look at their Google Analytics data, but we need something to go off, right?
32:16
I know that the location here is always going to be the United States
32:27
language English. Okay, that's all we need to do. But now again on the right hand side of this menu, we need to make
32:33
sure that we align the organic traffic estimation and we need to find it here. I believe that is uh maybe search
32:39
performance uh organic traffic estimation. Perfect. You need to wait for that to load before you click run.
32:46
Otherwise, this thing won't work. I'm going to go run. Great. And now I've got the estimated
32:52
traffic for all the websites, all my competitors again. Right.
32:58
Beautiful. I'm just going to do it quickly for the actual client in this instance. I
33:05
probably should have done it all together, but never mind. And okay, Align Landing is actually
33:11
getting a bit of traffic as well. That's great.
33:16
Okay. Next, we need to get the back links of everybody. We're going to touch on backlinks quite a lot in the next
33:23
section or in a couple of sections down in this tutorial, but if you've been around and done SEO for any time, you
33:29
know that back links are quite important. So, um, we need to click further on the right.
33:37
Bulk backlinks overview. Again, this is going to allow us to get all the estimated backlinks that they are
33:43
getting. Uh, we need to as well make sure that we've got that selected.
33:52
Bulk backlink overview. So, again, we're aligning the tab with this here.
33:59
Cool. So, now we're starting to get a bit of an understanding of why competitors are ranking higher than our
34:06
than our competitor. But I'm getting ahead of myself. But you'll start seeing, for example, the things are
34:11
correlating already. This guy's the MTG pros. They have the most amount of
34:17
traffic. So therefore, we can estimate the most amount of uh leads. And funnily enough, they've got the most amount of
34:23
backlinks. Is it a direct correlation? Yes and no. But the very high probability that it is. Right. So now
34:30
the ranked keywords. This is going to take a little while for us, but it's going to be very, very much worth it. So
34:36
let's do the first one, the client here. And we want to understand not only how many keywords they're ranking for, but
34:42
what are those keywords. So we need to find here the one that says ranked keywords. We need to put the URL in
34:49
there. Make sure you have the right location. And here they return the number of keywords. I like to start with
34:56
at least 80. The rest can stay the same. Uh let's find here as well ranked keywords
35:05
and I'm going to run. This is going to tell us uh how many keywords they're
35:11
ranking for and what they are as well. This is really really valuable data. Now
35:17
if I did this search probably with ah or SEM Rush, I might get really different
35:22
data here. So this is where it's best to stick with one SEO tool to do everything. Otherwise, you're going to
35:27
get a mix and match of different data sets and it's probably not going to be that good. So, I want to copy all this.
35:36
I want to go back to our sheet here. And I want to start a new tab. I want to hit
35:42
that. And this tab is going to be called the tab of the research we just did,
35:49
which is so we did keyword research or ranked keywords for aligned lending. So
35:55
down in the tab here, we're going to go uh ranked keywords
36:01
and align lending. And here in the competitors, I'm going to press command
36:08
K so that I can um
36:13
link to ranked keywords. So now really easily with one click, I'd see oop
36:20
sorry. So now what I want to do is now that
36:25
I've put that key all the keywords they're ranking for there. I just want to copy the number com uh go back to the
36:32
competitors. So the client is ranking for four keywords. But I want to take it a step further. I'm going to go command
36:39
K or insert a backlink here and I'm going to look for this tab here. Ranked keywords.
36:49
Rank keywords align lending. So, what this allows me to do is really simply see, okay, well, they're ranking for
36:55
four keywords apparently. And if I want to see what those keywords are, I've got it in that tab with associates with that
37:01
client, right? So, now I want to do the same thing for all the four competitors. You can skip this, but I'm going to do
37:07
for all four of them so we don't miss out on anything. So, now I'm going to try uh MTG Pros. I'm going to go back to
37:15
data for SEO. I'm going to paste that. And I need to go to run. Remember, I've
37:21
got number of returned keywords, 80. I'm assuming these guys are going to be ranking for a lot more keywords. There
37:27
we go. So, they are ranking for a total of 61 keywords. I want to grab this
37:32
again. This is where things are going to start getting very interesting. We're going to get some really useful data. So, again,
37:39
I'm going to start a brand new tab here. I'm going to call it
37:45
rank keywords. I need to name it uh the research that
37:53
we just did
38:01
so we don't get confused. Perfect. MGT pros or MTG pros.
38:08
We're going to copy all the data for the 61 keywords they're ranking for.
38:17
paste it in here and that is 61 that they're ranking for alto together.
38:22
Again, you're going to press command K if you're on a Mac. I think it's control K if you're on a Windows
38:31
rank keywords and it's going to be MGT pro. So now I know that MTG Pros is
38:37
ranking for 61 keywords. What are those keywords? Boom. Like magic, right? Let's do the same again. Let's get a little
38:44
bit smarter here. I'm just going to go and um
38:49
create the sheets ready for the other ones.
39:02
And one more.
39:18
All right, let's see how many keywords are these guys ranking
39:24
for.
39:30
Uh, let's run.
39:47
So, it's telling me they're only ranking for two keywords. Obviously, the reality is that they're probably ranking for
39:52
more, but again, we just want to stick with one data set.
39:58
And as long as you have one competitor that seems to have a lot of keywords, then you're okay.
40:04
And if they don't have many keywords, then that's a good thing for you again.
40:27
The final one, uh, Mitch Mortgage, which I'm guessing it's Michigan Mortgage. Uh,
40:32
they're probably going to be the ones that give us the most amount of useful data. Again, we're going to run.
40:43
Okay, this is a great example. So, here you see that we have only asked for 80 keywords returned, but in fact, they are
40:50
ranking for 101. I probably want to be sneaky and just rerun this with 101
40:57
so it returns all those keywords. When you're using with SEO, the more
41:03
data you have, the better decisions you can make. Um, so ideally, we want to do another search. So, it's going to give
41:08
us all the data. Fantastic. Perfect. It'll be really interesting going through some of those keywords to see
41:14
what these guys are ranking for. I'm going to copy this back to our other sheet.
41:21
Perfect. So that is 101 keywords.
41:45
Okay, now we start seeing some pretty interesting data, right? So,
41:51
you know, this tells a pretty interesting story that whilst the people that get the most amount of traffic
41:58
don't have the most amount of ranked keywords because maybe the keywords they're ranking for a pretty high
42:03
competition, they get a lot of traffic, whereas these guys are ranking for more keywords, but maybe it's not the right
42:09
ones or maybe they're getting more leads. So, I want to define this. This gives us a little bit of a sneak peek
42:15
into why people are ranking, but we're never going to get the whole story, right? But still search data that that's
42:21
quite interesting. What I want to do is go and have a look through some of our
42:27
competitors and just see if some of these keywords are something that I should think about for the customer. For
42:34
example, um Detroit mortgage broker. They're in Michigan. They might they might have
42:40
really local pages. So, let's see here. The mortgage pro mortgage professionals,
42:47
mortgage brokers in Michigan, u mortgage professionals. Let's see.
42:53
Looks like they're also targeting Texas.
43:01
Best FHA loan company. We might have to do a page about that as well. Mortgage broker refinancing. That is a probably
43:08
pretty good keyword. Although it's going to have uh
43:14
Yeah. No, that seems pretty pretty good. Okay, great. So, now we have some really
43:20
rich data, right? Again, a lot of people get stuck here, but I recommend you go
43:26
through some of these keywords and some of them might be concentrating on things that you never thought of. So, have a
43:31
human look here to see if anything kind of uh really comes out to you. I think this one is really interesting. The one
43:36
that has 101 keywords. I want to see here what they might have.
43:45
Mortgage one rap grand rapids. That might be a brand name
43:50
or a location. I'm not sure. So, okay, they're ranking for what is MIG?
44:00
Mortgage Express. That might be a good keyword. NMLS Michigan whatever that is. So again
44:08
you know your industry better than better than obviously the uh AI does and the search engine does. So you need to
44:14
understand if those keywords are relevant related if those keywords are useful for you.
44:29
Okay. So, this is all well and good, but
44:35
how do we make sense of all this? Again, we're going to go to GPT. We're going to start a new chat. We're going to provide
44:41
it with this prompt that I'll leave as well for you guys to have. It's not too complicated. Again, we're not doing
44:47
rocket science. We're just organizing dirty data. And GPG is fairly smart at that. So, I'm going to give it uh the
44:54
prompt. It just says I will provide you some competitor data that includes with all the things that we're going to give
44:59
it. And then we've defined the output. That really makes a good prompt. Defining the input and the output that
45:04
you expect as well as giving it a kind of personality. So a uh expert SEO. What
45:11
I can do here um is just say uh the
45:17
find is and just define this a little bit more.
45:24
their rest are competitors.
45:29
And in their Google sheet here, what you want to do is
45:34
make sure you've got all the data here.
45:44
We want to export this as a CSV file. Now, be very careful here. When you
45:50
export the CSV file, you're only exporting that tab, which is okay, but you're not exporting the whole sheet at
45:56
once. I'm going to go CSV. So, I'm exporting the competitors tab. So, now I
46:01
want to do everything individually as well. So, let's go for this one. Download CSV.
46:07
This one,
46:13
download a CSV. So on and so forth.
46:22
Okay. So, let's go to back to GPT. And now I've got all of the
46:29
data that I want to give it. So, I've got the competitors
46:43
and I've given it everything. Now you can change this to a thinking model but again GPT5 is more than smart enough for
46:50
all this. See it's analyzing everything. It should take a minute and it will give us a pretty good plan.
46:57
Let's take a quick look. Um here are the prior prioritized keywords and backlink
47:02
opportunities for align lending which is the the client that we're trying to rank in this example.
47:08
So there's a gap um keyword search volume following commercial main page
47:13
mortgage pro. I think that's a pretty good one.
47:20
Backlinking opportunities. So MTG pros heavily have heavily local backlinks. Uh
47:26
likely include local directories, chamber of commerce partners, yada yada. Top three opportunities to prioritize.
47:34
target Michigan home loan rates with blog posts that have a low keyword difficulty of 10 because it has that
47:40
data we provided that with and strong search volume of 5,400. So, we can
47:45
probably create um guides, how to what's the first 10 steps. We'll get to that in
47:51
a second, right? But we're going to use that keyword. I'm just going to save it because then I'll show you how to create content around that that's going to help
47:57
us rank.
48:08
Optimize for mortgage lenders. Mortgage lenders in Michigan as a subpage. That's a good one.
48:19
Mortgage pros. Whilst that is a competitor keyword or that's the competitor's name, mortgage pros, we
48:25
could probably do a them versus us type of blog post or comparison which will
48:30
allow us to rank for that as well. So cool. Already it's given you the three priorities to optimize. You can probably
48:36
do um ask it follow on questions.
48:54
Uh tell me what are the opportunities for us to build more transactional type pages that will help us rank for the
48:59
other keywords. And this is why I can't give you a complete step-by-step guide because the strategy will change quite a
49:06
lot depending on the data that you get. Um, and this is why giving GPT5 all this
49:11
good data, improving the input will improve the output.
49:21
Perfect. So, it's giving us the keyword, the search volume, the rationale by why we
49:28
want to build those pages, and even the suggested page type, whether it's a product, the locationbased service
49:34
pages, which we'll get into in a second.
49:40
Perfect. So, now with the keyword research done, we know what are the keywords we need to place in our main
49:45
services pages and then the blog post we need to write about. And now we see, well, what are our competitors ranking
49:51
for that we can leverage? they are doing for our strategies. You can get more complex but I think this is enough to
49:57
start you off with. The more competitors you have the better. Essentially we are
50:03
improving GPT's input and therefore the output by giving it this high quality
50:08
data. And you probably would have used
50:13
like not even a cent like fractions of a cent for all this research and you've got an SEO tool that you can go back to
50:20
and use all the time. I highly recommend you mix the data for SEO output with GPT
50:25
and it really really help you speed up your whole SEO process without getting stuck at the research stage.
50:33
So, we found keyword gaps and we found prioritize uh traffic wins already. Then you can do the other ones if you want
50:39
to, but I think those two are great to start off with. Next in our tutorial is
Website Structure
50:44
website structure. This is one of the things I see many people getting wrong
50:50
in the beginning and it can be fundamentally the most important thing. No matter how much fancy AI tools you
50:56
use for SEO, if you don't have the correct website structure, good luck ranking. And I think it can be narrowed
51:03
down to one saying, which is measure twice, cut once. And I know that's a carpenter saying, but it really drives
51:10
home here. Essentially, you need to plan your website before you start to build. Before you even touch a website builder
51:17
like WordPress, Web Flow, Shopify, whatever it is that you're building your website in, have a structure first. And
51:22
we're going to show you a couple of ways you can think about creating the structure in a second. But essentially,
51:28
you want to decide your core pages, home, about, the services, the contact, the blog posts. You need to make sure
51:35
that if it's a service-based business, every service needs their individual page. If it's a an e-commerce store, you
51:42
need to have pages for your categories, subcategories, sub subcategories, and so on, and even the products. Of course,
51:48
you need to plan the internal linking. How is everything going to link with each other? That's not only very, very
51:54
important from an SEO perspective, but from a navigation perspective as well. draft up the titles, the H1, the URL
52:00
structure, what that is going to look like so that you avoid the common mistakes, which is no structure equals
52:07
months of work in the future. And I can testify this because I can I've seen
52:12
this so many times. People get excited about building a website and kind of jump into it before planning. This goes
52:19
with the AI website builders as well that I don't really recommend yet and sometimes they make the mistake because
52:25
you don't explain what you need well enough. This also avoids content duplication uh and orphan pages. An
52:32
orphan page is one that isn't linking to anything in the p in a website. So I'm
52:37
going to show you two main ways that you can visualize this. Right? The first way is with a bit of a website
52:44
site map or it's they sometimes call it a wireframe. Regardless of what you call it, I think it's really good to
52:50
visualize your website like this. The other way of visualizing it through a Google sheet, which I'll show you as well, but we're going to use a very
52:58
simple website sitemap for a service-based business that offers their services in different locations. This is
53:05
the way that I want you to start thinking about this where you need to understand, okay, what is my menu going
53:11
to look like? What lives under this menu and what's the parent page for each one of these subpages? So, for a
53:19
services-based business that could be a plumber or a carpenter or whatever you
53:24
want, you can have your main services pages, hub page, about us, blog,
53:30
resources, contact, and then locations pages. And we're going to go through this just in tiny detail. So for
53:35
example, the main services hub. What I mean here is one page that is the
53:42
umbrella term for the ma all the services that you have. For example, if you are a plumber, you might have three
53:49
additional services. So plumbing services is the umbrella term, but you
53:54
might have hot water installation, 24-hour repair, and pipe leak repair,
54:00
for example. Those are your sub services. So server one, service two, service three. But your main page,
54:07
services pages have has all these services here. In a really rough kind of understanding of what that page might
54:14
look like, again, this is just very rough detail might be the main pages. So
54:19
for example, let's say we're using a plumber all over New York. So Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx, right? The H1 as
54:26
well as the title of the page might be main service. So main service being plumbing in New York. And the URL
54:34
structure is just forward slash use your website forward slashservices can be plumbing services but services is fine.
54:41
Then a CTA which stands for a call to action. So the first thing I see should be a call to action as well as the main
54:46
title of the service that you have. Maybe an intro to the services review section is really important. The
54:53
benefits that how it works another call to action FAQ and then the subervices.
54:59
You don't have to follow this structure to the letter, but it's a good idea to do so. If you think another structure
55:04
works, that's fine. But what isn't negotiable in my experience and in my opinion is the H1 and the title being
55:12
the main service plus the main location. So if you're in a big city, let's use
55:19
another example. If you're in Melbourne and you're providing these services, it would be main service. So plumbing in
55:24
Melbourne. And I'm going to show you how you're going to rank higher for each individual suburb. So that's the main
55:30
services. And then at the bottom or wherever in the page that you illustrate that you have subservices. So subservice
55:37
one might be uh emergency plumbing, hot water installation and pipely compare
55:42
for example. They need to have their individual page services. And the URL structure can look like this. Your
55:48
website/services/subservices. So this might look like your website
55:55
services/emergency plumbing services, right? So this would say uh new uh emergency plumbing
56:03
services in New York or emergency plumbing services in Melbourne. That's the main both of the location but the
56:09
subservice. And you see that the structure I've purposely done for all the pages exactly the same meaning the
56:16
layout of the page. That's fine. You won't get done for content duplication if the website structure or the design
56:23
is the same as long as the onpage content is different. We're going to go into what really needs to be different
56:30
later down in this tutorial so you don't get done for content duplication. But you see they're all the same, but what
56:35
I'm just changing is the subservice one, subservice 2, subservice 3, and the URL
56:41
structure changes a little bit. I'm going to give you a copy of this map of this architecture so you can have a look
56:46
at it. Right. Then I'm also interlinking to the other services. So this can these services
56:52
live in the main service hub page or in a dropown for your main services. So
56:59
what happens if we want to rank for internal locations within that main city, that main state, right? Because
57:05
for example, if you're in New York, you might not just want to rank for plumber in New York, but it might be beneficial
57:11
for you to rank for plumber in Manhattan, plumber in Brooklyn, plumber in the Bronx. Right? This is going to be
57:17
very uh high intent transactional keywords that if you rank well for you'll do really really well. So how
57:23
would that work? Well, for location one, so this would be an example of Brooklyn.
57:29
Instead of New York, you have the website structure forward slash location one. Let's say Brooklyn. So a sub
57:36
location of the main area that you're in with the main service. And again, we follow the same structure. We have three
57:42
subservices, but this would be location one. So, Brooklyn subservice one uh hot
57:49
water installation or emergency uh plumber, right? This will make sense if you take a while and just think of this
57:55
structure, but the main thing is to dedicate main pages for the subervices
58:01
and the sub locations. This ensures that you match the user search intent a lot
58:06
better. Right? I wanted to also give you this in another example of a Google
58:12
sheet. I think it makes it a little bit more easy to understand. You can make a copy of this and make it your own, but I
58:18
wanted to had it filled out with actual locations so this would make sense, right? So, essentially, if we have these
58:24
three locations that are within New York that we want to rank, we have the main location pages. So, one location would
58:30
be Brooklyn, for example. Let's make sure I spell that right, otherwise I'm going to get killed in the comments. So,
58:35
if we have a main page that is Brooklyn and we have Brooklyn plumbing services,
58:40
the subpages for this would be drain cleaning in Brooklyn, hot water installation in Brooklyn, and emergency
58:46
plumbing in Brooklyn because those are the things that I want to rank for. Therefore, I've done the URL structure as well, what the targeting keyword is
58:54
going to be, the intent, and if I plan all this out, I know how to build the
58:59
structure, what everything needs to link to, and what are the things that I also should be ranking for. If I build the
59:05
pages dedicated with the keyword and the location, it should replicate me ranking for those keywords in the future. Right?
59:12
So again, you won't get done for content duplication if you just structure
59:18
everything correctly. And then we're going to go in a in a few and in in the
59:23
future in and in and further down the track in this and
59:29
further down the track in this tutorial, I'm going to show you how you set up the pages so you really don't get done for content duplication. There is a little
59:36
bit of argument in the internet saying that well you're wasting crawling resources by doing these pages and that
59:42
might be the case but to be honest for our experience this has always worked extremely well no matter which niche
59:48
that you're in but you need to plan accordingly. If you have any questions
59:54
about this, leave it in the comments below. But I really want you to understand this that you need to plan this out.
1:00:01
And you can take both this website sitemap or wireframe and the Google sheet. So you put it to your use case.
1:00:09
And remember, this doesn't just have to be for local businesses, but if it's for an e-commerce store or a blog post,
1:00:15
everything should have a structure of main pages, subpages, and subpages. You
1:00:20
can't kind of have too many pages as long as they're answering some sort of search intent. So again, I just want to
1:00:27
summarize this by please plan your website structure out. I've given you plenty examples to think this through
1:00:34
and then start building your website because if you don't get this right, you will pay for it dearly in the f. Next
Content Workflow
1:00:40
section is probably one of my favorite ones and one that everybody asked me for, which is content workflow. What I
1:00:46
mean here is how to generate highquality content using AI that's going to help you rank, rank for more keywords, get
1:00:54
organic traffic, and turn you into the topical authority figure. I want to be very clear here. My intention here is to
1:01:00
use AI as an extension, not as a complete replacement of you. I'm not wanting to ram write spammy content. I
1:01:07
want to make that very very clear. So also, search engines don't penalize AI
1:01:13
content. They only penalize lowquality content. I think we've been through that already. But the thing is that all
1:01:19
spammy content looks AI, right? But not all AI content is spammy. So, as long as
1:01:24
you create content with the want and the need to add a lot more value, you're going to be just fine. Obviously, some
1:01:31
things slip through the cracks. There's some websites that are 100% AI generated and for some reason they're ranking
1:01:37
really well. But my recommendation is don't try to copy them because it probably won't work for you. SEO is a
1:01:43
bit weird like that. And if you are doubting if I'm actually uh correct with this whether or somebody says and tells
1:01:50
you Google penalizes AI content, you can send them this link where they're really clear and they say that they reward
1:01:56
content uh highquality content however it's produced. So whether it's produced where they are or not, but it's got to
1:02:03
be high quality and that's what we're going to ensure you do. And to write highquality content isn't necessarily
1:02:10
difficult. So I'm going to show you a lot of strategies in which we found really successful to write content that
1:02:16
gets you seen in the AI search overviews, GPT search and perplexity. And a lot of the strategies that we
1:02:21
teach thankfully have been backed up by peer-review articles by research. This
1:02:27
is the first research paper uh published by Princeton University on GEO optimization strategies that if you
1:02:34
follow those, they give you an average 40% increase to be seen in the AI overviews. And to summarize the paper,
1:02:41
what they say as well as what we teach essentially is you need to write content
1:02:47
that's unique to you. So you need to find your tone of voice. And we're going to literally do that in a second. You
1:02:52
want to add value to the user. And we do that by finding the questions your audience is asking. Guess what? We
1:02:58
already did that in the video already. You want to, this is really, really important. You want to add data to back
1:03:05
up your statements. and not only add data to back up your statement, but you want to reference where you got the data
1:03:11
from. What I mean here is for example when I say that uh drinking 2 L of water
1:03:17
a day is is healthy for you. No, what you want to say is be more specific. So
1:03:22
link research shows that uh drinking 2 L of day will increase your health by 84%.
1:03:29
I don't know but you just want to back up the data and where you get that data from you want to back link to that. That's really important. The study found
1:03:36
that it's probably best to write at an eighth grade level. This makes it a lot more approachable for most people on the
1:03:42
internet. This isn't dumbing down your content. This is just making it simple. So, don't over complicate it and use
1:03:49
fluffy words. Whenever possible, cut the fluff. Get to the point right away. This
1:03:55
is why what doesn't rank well is the classic AI stuff that says in the ever evolving world of no, right? Always
1:04:02
write an initial draft. polish when possible. And by polish, I mean really cut the content wherever it has some
1:04:09
unnecessary fluff. And then we want to add supporting visuals. We're going to do all of this with the help of AI, but
1:04:16
using it as an extension, not as a replacement. So,
1:04:22
I like to get a couple of things when I'm writing with AI. My preference is GPT. People prefer claude. Whatever you
1:04:29
prefer doesn't really matter, but I think this workflow will work really well for you regardless. I think you
1:04:35
need two main things to write good content that sounds like you, which is the main thing I want you to achieve here, and that is your own negative
1:04:41
keyword list. I've got one here, and you can start with this one. My recommendation is that you start with
1:04:48
your own negative keyword list. And as time goes, and you're starting to write with AI, and it uses a phrase or an M
1:04:56
dash, for example, um, Let's use that one there. You place it in here, right?
1:05:03
And you tell it, don't use that. I don't like that. And you have a negative keyword list. And the last thing that we're going to get is a tone of voice
1:05:10
document for this. So then you can add both the negative keyword list, the tone of voice document, plus a handy dandy
1:05:16
little prompt that you guys have access to, which is going to write really well for you, and it'll make things a lot
1:05:21
easier. But we're using the canvas feature, the collaborative feature, and we'll go through that in a second. So,
1:05:27
apart from the negative keyword list and the prompt that I've provided in the resources, you need a tone of voice
1:05:32
document. This is a distillation of what your tone of voice is or what it sounds
1:05:38
like. To do this, you need some sort of content that you've put some effort to,
1:05:43
ideally without AI, at least this time, and you've written and you think that it really sounds like you. It represents
1:05:49
your tone of voice. It doesn't have to be something that has done really well. For example, this is a blog post that
1:05:55
I've written or a LinkedIn post that got seven likes, right? Next to nothing. But that's not the point here. The point is
1:06:01
that I was really proud of how it sounded because I was stuck in an airport lounge and I didn't have internet, but I wrote the whole thing
1:06:07
and it really sounds like me. It's a little bit cheeky. I think there's a couple of swear words here and there and I back up my statements. What I'm going
1:06:14
to do is going to grab that and in the resources below there's going to be this toner voice GPT. It's pretty obvious
1:06:21
what it does. You just need to paste the tone of voice documentation that you think sounds like you. This can be an
1:06:28
email, a blog post, a LinkedIn post like I did. The more the better. You're going to give it a while and it's going to
1:06:33
create this tone of voice document for you. Now, my recommendation is for you to read it, please, and see if you agree
1:06:41
with it. If you don't, tell it, hey, I don't agree with this. I want to make sure this sounds more like X instead of
1:06:47
zed. You get the idea. But let's say I'm happy with this whole thing. I'm going
1:06:52
to copy everything and I'm going to go to a Google doc. Paste it the whole
1:06:58
thing in there and I'm going to write this tone of voice doc.
1:07:05
So now we are pretty much ready to go. The only last thing that we need is some
1:07:10
sort of topic that we want to write about. Let's go back to our keyword research document. There is this one
1:07:17
here. Are home equity agreements a good idea? I think it's a pretty good blog post to write about to be honest. So,
1:07:24
I'm going to write about that. We're going to start a brand new uh chat
1:07:29
within chat GBT. We're going to grab the copyrightiting prompt that I'll leave in the resources below and we're going to
1:07:35
paste that into the chat. You can see if I scroll to the top of the prompt, it's got insert keyword question there. So,
1:07:42
that's pretty self-explanatory. You want to go to the research that we've done. We want to write about home equity
1:07:48
agreements for example and then we want to go back to GPT and we're going to
1:07:53
paste it. Oh, sorry. What happened?
1:08:00
We want to copy this.
1:08:05
We want to go back to chat GBT and we want to make sure we put it in
1:08:12
brackets so it understands that. Then the we want to insert the doc the tone
1:08:17
of voice document. So we need to download this guy. Download as a simple text file.
1:08:23
Perfect. And we want to download the negative keyword list while we are at it. Remember you want to keep adding
1:08:29
your own special negative keywords in that. So we're going to drop those two documents in there. Negative keyword
1:08:35
list tone of voice. And then we just need to change these to attached.
1:08:44
And the other one as well.
1:08:50
Perfect. Now we're going to hit enter. This isn't going to go and write this thing right away. You can see that I've
1:08:55
selected GBT5 and I've selected the automatic. So it chooses which model. Now I've purposely told it to ask some
1:09:02
preliminary questions because without like we've done for the keyword research or when we gave GPT all the keyword
1:09:09
research data. We want to get more from us so that the output is better. The
1:09:14
better the input, the better the output. No matter how smart these models are. If the input is garbage, the output will be
1:09:20
garbage. And we're improving the input by getting it to ask you questions. For example, it's asking who is this written
1:09:26
for? homeowners, real estate investors, financial adviserss. Uh so this is written for uh homeowners in Michigan.
1:09:34
Well, people that want to buy new homes in Michigan.
1:09:40
So here uh the main goal is to provide as much value as possible to new homeowners in Michigan in the United
1:09:46
States. And I don't have any specifics for number four and five.
1:09:56
Perfect. So, I'm going to give it that. Now, it's going to do some research because we want to reference highquality
1:10:02
sources, specifically when it comes to this type of content where it's about a financial aspect. You fall under this
1:10:08
category called your money, your life. I've done a video about it. I'll leave it linked in the resources. It's really important. Okay, perfect. Now, it's
1:10:14
asking me some continuous follow-up questions, which is good. Don't get annoyed because the more information it
1:10:19
gets from you, the better. So, perfect.
1:10:28
Are these Michigan already settled or in their homes or they're looking for equity access? Are there aspiring
1:10:33
buyers? Um, let's do something a little bit uh
1:10:43
let's do something tricky here. So, I'm going to do something very lazy and you might be able to do this as well. And I
1:10:48
want to show you the flexibility of this. Ideally, don't do something like that. But what I'm going to do is say
1:10:56
that is the website we're writing for. Crawl the site and find the answers.
1:11:08
And I just want to make sure that we've got enabled the web search. Ideally, you don't want to do that, but I don't understand enough about this topic um
1:11:15
that I just want to give it the stuff. Perfect.
1:11:21
Perfect. So now it's given me the outline which it should have, right? And now I can say perfect. Um, now write the
1:11:30
whole thing. And I'm just going to make sure it doesn't use a search thing now.
1:11:37
And it should open up the canvas automatically because it knows once it's you answered the questions that it's
1:11:43
asked. It'll do the research. It'll give you the structure for the blog post which you can tell it to amend if you're
1:11:49
not happy with it. and then it'll go and write this. Right?
1:11:54
So, you can see here that it's doing a couple of really really good things. So, it's
1:12:00
um writing really well. You can delete the m dashes if you want, but a really important thing is that it's backlinking
1:12:06
to the right sources already. That is a non-negotiable, particularly if you fall under your money, your life. And we've
1:12:12
got a pretty decent blog post. The reason why I like writing like this in the canvas feature is because if I don't
1:12:18
like the m dashes, I can simply delete them directly from the platform. I think it's pretty good. Um, and you can see
1:12:25
here that everything is back linking to the right resources. Fantastic. So if you
1:12:33
want to shorten something or
1:12:38
let's say here I want to say um add one more scenario
1:12:46
and it'll just amend that section there and if I want to say for example can you
1:12:52
simplify this or can you complicate this a little bit perfect
1:12:59
whatever it is that you want right I I just really like this way of writing. So, is this ready to be published right
1:13:05
away? No. Right. I'm going to uh show you what I would add in this. So, I'm
1:13:12
going to place this thing in a whole Google doc. It's really difficult to show you what it looks like in the back end of a website because you might have
1:13:19
WordPress, Web Flow, Wix, whatever. But I think you get the idea. It's you kind of put this in your the back end of your
1:13:25
website as as a blog post. However, don't add it as a blog post yet. What I like to do is put it all in a Google
1:13:31
doc. Right? I've also said at the bottom of the prompt, by the way, to add an FAQ, which is really important at the
1:13:36
end. So, one more thing that you can do to make this really
1:13:44
a little easier to understand is for example, what is a home loan, equity loan? What
1:13:50
we want to try and add or this one here actually perfect
1:13:55
is we want to add a supporting visual element that is going to add value to the content by making this more easy to
1:14:02
understand because we've given it an visual element. Might sound really difficult, but it's actually quite easy.
1:14:08
We're going to go to a free tool called napkin.ai. If you followed me for any period of time, you've probably seen
1:14:14
this tool. As of the time of this recording, the free version is phenomenal and it is worth it. So, I'm
1:14:21
going to go new napkin and I'm going to go to a brand uh brand new napkin. I'm
1:14:27
going to paste all of the stuff in here. I'm going to select everything so it understands that I wanted to reference
1:14:32
everything and I'm going to press this button. Now, it's reading this whole thing and it's trying to understand what
1:14:38
is the best way to visualize the point that we're trying to get across here. And already perfect. This is pros and
1:14:45
cons. Equity home loans. Nice. And I think I like this here.
1:14:52
Yeah, that's pretty good. You can change the styling here. You can make that a
1:14:58
little bit darker. That's pretty good. So, now I can download this as a PNG.
1:15:05
Remember, if you're uploading that to your actual website, don't have it as a PNG. What you want to do is go to
1:15:12
something like uh PNG to webp and you want to upload that as a webp and you
1:15:19
want to convert it so when you upload it to your computer oh sorry to your website computer it's too late um the
1:15:26
thing is going to be a webp and if that's just a more optimized file size it's very light and pgs are probably the
1:15:32
one culprit of making websites really heavy so make sure it's a webp file. Anyway, enough about that. Uh so here
1:15:40
below the section I can add my visual.
1:15:46
Right. The next thing that you want to do is one more thing is
1:15:52
if you have a certain keyword. So let's say this service website did in fact
1:16:00
offer home equity agreements contracts, right? I don't know if they do. Let's say they did.
1:16:06
uh let's say this said home equity agreements. What I want to do is make sure that that blog post is linking
1:16:13
to that page and in that sense I am writing content that is therefore
1:16:21
supporting that main services page because a blog post without internal
1:16:26
links is a bit little bit like a room within a house without doors anywhere
1:16:31
else. So I hope that makes sense. You need to backlink to other sections of your website. So, two types of links.
1:16:38
Remember, you need to back up the statements with the sources of where you found the information and you need to link internally into your website.
1:16:44
And now you can upload this to your website. It's pretty good. Do the due diligence and read it. Make sure that
1:16:50
you're happy with it. You're the subject matter expert, but now you've kind of done everything a little bit quicker.
1:16:56
One more thing you can add in here, which ideally you can, is your experience about the topic. Let's say
1:17:01
you have a story like, "Oh, I once helped a client gym. Get a uh what are
1:17:07
we talking about? Get a home equity agreement and this is what happened." If
1:17:12
you can add your experience, that's another tick in the box. So, perfect. Now, we've written a blog post that is
1:17:18
giving you the highest possibility to rank really well. What if we want to do this at scale, right? Here's a quick
1:17:27
tutorial on how to do that as well. This is the next section on the content creation cuz I want to give you two workflows. Right? So there are many
1:17:34
tools to create content at scale. Before we even get to the content at scale, I
1:17:41
want to make sure that we understand again really clearly why we are writing all this content. So in this instance,
1:17:49
this kind of represents the content that we're writing. This is also called the content pillar and satellite strategy.
1:17:56
So the content pillar for example uh this is visualized by the blue circle.
1:18:01
This can be your services page. So in this example we were writing or we were creating a bit of a plan for a website
1:18:07
that is a travel agency for Tulum in Mexico. So we have one main page that is traveling to Tulum how to get there and
1:18:14
services and all the green ones are the supporting articles answering smaller questions in detail
1:18:19
but they're all linking as you can see to the main page which is kind of just what we did before. But then how do you
1:18:25
write all these other green blog posts is a lot really quickly while still maintaining the tone of voice that it's
1:18:31
well researched and it's going to have our experiences. One of my the tools that I use all the
1:18:38
time is Machined AI. You can create an account. Um you'll get some sort of discount below if you use the link below. You're going to sign in and this
1:18:46
is going to allow you to create clusters of content at once. So, a cluster of
1:18:51
content being this. And this is also um a bring your own key
1:18:57
type of tool. You bring your own API key if you want to or you can use your own API key. Just quickly, if you do want to
1:19:03
use your own API key because it's slightly cheaper, um you want to go to playground
1:19:09
and I'll leave a tutorial on how to get your API key, but you'll need to set up an account with the playground from
1:19:16
OpenAI, which is a different platform than the normal GBT that we use. You I
1:19:21
mean it's a different service altogether than this front-end GBT. Perfect. So, uh, you need to get your
1:19:28
API key, which you do in the dashboard,
1:19:33
going to API keys. You're going to create a new secret key. You're going to
1:19:39
name it, for example, test. You're going to create a key. It's really important that you save this key now because
1:19:46
that's the last time you're going to see it. So, you want to copy it. Done. I'm just going to delete this so you guys
1:19:51
don't have access to it. Anyway, so with that copied, you want to go to uh the
1:19:58
settings of this
1:20:04
your account. Um, and if you press here for open a API key, you're not going to
1:20:09
have that, right? And you're going to place your API key in there. Make sure you need you have some credits in your
1:20:16
um open AI account. So, how we write how do we write a cluster of content here? It's quite easy. You're not going to
1:20:21
have all these things here. You're going to go up to the clusters. You're going to go to create content and the topic.
1:20:28
This is really, really important, right? So, you can see here they've given us the example of dogs, Labrador exercises,
1:20:36
meaning we want to write a content cluster about the best exercises for Labrador dogs, right? We have a section
1:20:43
for audience, the language, and a bunch more things. So, let's take our example before, and we're going to write about
1:20:51
home equity loan. Uh D. We're going to go back here,
1:21:03
your first mortgage, home equity loans. Right? So that's a subtopic. And for the
1:21:08
audience, we're going to do first home buyers of small families in Michigan,
1:21:13
United States. That's the audience. The more you define the audience, the better. And we're going to leave the language as
1:21:20
the United States.
1:21:28
uh English, United States, and the engine we're going to leave in V3.
1:21:33
You can go to manual and place in all the other keywords that you want to rank for, but for now, I just want to focus
1:21:38
on that. The region, I'm going to use uh United States, and I'm going to start with a
1:21:44
cluster of 10 blog posts. What it's doing right now, it's doing research on
1:21:49
what the search intent for these keywords are, what's ranking really well for these types of keywords, and then
1:21:55
it's going to suggest not only the keywords, but the names of the titles.
1:22:01
So, you're going to give it a second to load, and you can see that it's got the
1:22:07
estimated search volume for the home loan calculator, home equity loan
1:22:12
lenders, home equity loan for debt consolidation. So all these pretty good
1:22:18
keywords hasn't written anything yet. So what you want to do, for example, I don't want a home loan calculator blog
1:22:24
post cuz it's not actually going to build the calculator for me. But I want to say that in the back of my mind, I want to build one. I just want to uh
1:22:30
make sure that I have just this one selected. And for example, I want to uh delete.
1:22:41
So it hasn't written anything. It's just given me all the examples that it recommends.
1:22:47
So, if I'm happy with all the keywords that it's going for, I can move on to the next couple of things. The content
1:22:53
type, I can make each of these ones different. So, informational, the ultimate guide, the list, the roundup,
1:23:00
the comparison reviews. For example, uh your guide to affordable loan
1:23:06
interest rates. D.
1:23:11
This one's interesting. So, which one is better? Home equity loan versus home equity line of credit. We want to make
1:23:17
that a comparison. For example, the rest can stay. This one's going to
1:23:24
be an ultimate guide. And you want to change it up a little bit. We're going to make that an ultimate guide.
1:23:31
In the next column, you see a custom brief. This is really important. So if
1:23:36
you have personal experience or you want the AI to touch on something specific
1:23:42
within that blog post, that is where you add it. For example, uh I don't know, I
1:23:48
want you to add that uh it's really easy for families with two ch two children
1:23:53
and if the two parents are also in the workforce to get a home loan. I don't
1:23:58
know if that's true or not, but my point is here is if you've got some knowledge in the topic and you want the AI to
1:24:04
touch on a certain thing within that topic or within that blog post, I should say, you want to place it in there.
1:24:10
Lastly, the author is really important. So, you can change the tone of voice. You see here, it's got some pre-built
1:24:17
tones of voices. And then I've also done my own custom tone of voice. Custom tone
1:24:22
of voice is really easy to create. In fact, we're kind of already there because we've created our tone of voice
1:24:28
before. We're going to create a tone of voice by going example
1:24:36
uh example
1:24:42
three. And I need to put some content in there. And thankfully, I've already selected my LinkedIn content that I used
1:24:49
before. So, it should the tone of voice should be somewhat uh similar. and I'm
1:24:54
going to analyze that. It'll analyze and it'll create another tone of voice document much like we have done. I don't
1:25:00
know if I got the idea from them. Well, it's a pretty it's a pretty like simple idea, right? And we're going to give it
1:25:06
a second. So, now we'll be able to write all of those articles in our tone of voice, which I really like.
1:25:17
So, now I've already done one. I've got the example three and now all the blog
1:25:22
posts are going to be rewritten or the titles will be written in that tone of voice. So makes sense, right? They need to have the tone of voice from the
1:25:28
beginning. The next the research is really important. We need to understand um
1:25:35
these are the domains you want to include because when it writes this, it'll start doing research into finding
1:25:40
the right sources that it should use as references. Like I've just taught you before, it's really important to back up
1:25:46
your statements. But if you don't want it to mention a competitor, that is where you place the competitor. Uh we're
1:25:52
going to leave that as automated directed. Um again, if I want it to crawl a certain site, so for example,
1:25:59
this site here, I'm going to leave the link here so that
1:26:05
it gets some direction as well. And the citations I'm going to leave as
1:26:12
inline links, not footnotes. And lastly, the images. Um, I'm going to use the
1:26:18
stability AI. And you want to see a style uh that you like. I'm just going to go for,
1:26:25
I don't know, uh, neon neoor. And let me show you what one looks like. So now
1:26:32
once they're all ready, you can start writing one. There's an advanced uh section where you
1:26:37
can choose the model. I'm going to use 01. You can use 01 or 04 mini. Obviously
1:26:43
01's going to be a bit more expensive. I think it ends up being about 50 cents per blog post, but it's a really good
1:26:49
banging blog post, right? Uh obviously 04 mini is not going to be as good. To be honest, I've tested both and as long
1:26:56
as you add take the two seconds to add all the information we've done prior,
1:27:01
it's going to write good content. I'm going to change the other one for 4 mini and I'm going to write as well. You'll see that 4 minutes is a lot quicker.
1:27:11
Now, after a couple of seconds, we have our first RO blog written. What I really like about this is you can edit it
1:27:16
directly within the platform. Now, you can see here that everything uh in blue,
1:27:22
the read the blue links are the links that it's sourcing. And sometimes it will have some internal linking to the
1:27:29
blog post within this cluster, which is what you want. If you don't like what it's written about, for example, if I
1:27:35
want to uh get rid of that, I can. It's really good.
1:27:41
And I can copy this whole thing and I can export it as a whatever I want as PDF or whatever. I can copy this whole
1:27:47
thing. I can also, if you connect it, I'm not going to go through the connection now, but I can publish it to my CMS uh directly. So,
1:27:55
you see my website there. So, I can publish it as a draft in my website. You can do this with your client websites,
1:28:00
with your websites, but they only have a native connection at the moment for WordPress and Web Flow. But apart from
1:28:06
that, you can't just copy the blog post and paste it in your computer. Again, this isn't to replace your writing, but
1:28:12
this is to give you the ability to when you sit down in 1 hour, instead of writing one blog post, now you write 10
1:28:19
blog posts, but go back and do the due diligence and add some value to them. I don't want you just to generate
1:28:24
regurgitated AI fluff. That is not the point here. I want to make that very very clear. But you can now offer this
1:28:30
as a service. I think this is really really incredible and we've seen great results with this. And I want to finish
1:28:37
this content section by saying that this isn't the only tool that you need to use. If you have another AI content tool
1:28:44
that you prefer, by all means, use that one. But as long as you understand the fundamentals of what makes good AI
1:28:51
content or content generated with AI, then it doesn't matter what you use, right? But don't go blindly and trust a
1:28:59
tool that says our content will rank you number one. No, it won't. You need to
1:29:04
understand what actually makes good content. The next section is local SEO. This could be in itself a 3-hour plus
Local SEO
1:29:11
tutorial, but I'm going to give you the fundamentals and some some little tips and tricks that if you do, you're going
1:29:17
to win no matter what. I want to make sure we get a couple of things understood. is that to simplify things,
1:29:24
there are a lot more things that you can do for local SEO, but I want to simplify it to the three main actionable things
1:29:29
you need to do. These are non-negotiables. You need to obviously get your Google business profile and optimize it. You need to do some local
1:29:36
citations. These are local backlinks essentially. And you need to optimize your website for locality. These are the
1:29:42
three items that we're going to go for at the end of this video. as well. In the last section, I'm going to show you some really useful and cool Google
1:29:49
business profile automations that I highly recommend you do. You can even sell those automations as a service. So,
1:29:55
for the fundamentals of Google business profile, these are the quick fire rounds things that you need to do. You
1:30:00
obviously need to claim and verify your profile. That is a non-negotiable. That is the one thing that unfortunately I
1:30:06
cannot show you here because you need to have a physical office and it's getting a little bit harder and harder these
1:30:12
days to claim a Google business profile because there's been so many people trying to scam it. But you can do it if
1:30:19
your business is legit. That's okay. I've just got a brand new Google business profile that has already been claimed that we're going to go through
1:30:24
here. You need to add all primary and secondary categories in which your business fits in. I've got a GPT that's
1:30:32
going to help you do that. You need to actively request reviews from your customers. If you get anything from
1:30:38
that, it's that you can automate this as much as you want, like sending a text message when your service is completed.
1:30:44
But we've automated this each and every way that we can think of. And every time, the thing that works best is you
1:30:51
as a service provider or your employees is asking for a review afterwards. I'm going to make that very easy for you as
1:30:57
well. You need to respond to both negative and positive reviews. We're going to automate this in the last
1:31:03
section of this tutorial. You're going to upload a post at least once a week. You're going to upload fresh images
1:31:09
regularly. The goal is to get to a 100 images. In the next slide, I'm going to explain why that is such a key number.
1:31:16
Essentially, you need to treat your Google business profile like another social media account. It needs to be
1:31:22
active and you need to start responding to people as much as possible. Now, let's touch on this quickly. Why do we
1:31:28
want to upload images? Look, I try to do everything from a data-driven approach. There was a study done by Bright Local
1:31:35
that shows there is a incredible correlation between the Google business profiles that have over 100 images and
1:31:42
the amount of website visits, direction request, and calls they get essentially conversions they get. So you see here,
1:31:49
it's indicated by the number of images of Google business profiles. When you get plus 100, everything the website
1:31:55
visits, the direction request, and the calls seem to shoot up exponentially. So, that is your goal now to get a 100
1:32:01
images. Again, we're going to automate that at the end of this tutorial from Instagram to Google business profile.
1:32:08
But for now, let's go to a Google business account. I've got this one here. Again, not my client, just a
1:32:13
friend of ours, but they've left this aside. So, I thought great, this is a fantastic opportunity for me to try and help. One of the main things that gets
1:32:20
really difficult is filling out this whole thing with correct information. We don't know what the primary categories
1:32:26
are, what the secondary categories are, and they are very, very important. So, let's optimize this Google business
1:32:31
profile together. I'm going to grab the link of the website and I'm going to go to this a custom GPT. The custom GPT is
1:32:39
a Google business profile category finder. There are so many different categories and sometimes we can't keep
1:32:44
track of them all. So, I've downloaded a CSV document from Google telling me all
1:32:50
the official categories, and this is going to help us find those and see which ones are relevant. You're going to
1:32:55
give it the URL. If you don't have the URL, you're going to give it uh as much information as you can about the
1:33:00
business. So, already found the categories for me. Excuse me. So, it's reviewed the GBT guidance and the
1:33:07
documentation that I've given it. So, it's given us a couple of things. So, primary ones, disability services, and
1:33:12
support organizations. So, let's see if we can find that one there. And we're going to add the category here,
1:33:19
disability and support organization. So, it was right there. Perfect. We're going to save that. And what we're going to do as well is we're going to add more
1:33:26
categories. You can add more categories as long as they're relevant. So, let's go back to the GPT and see what it told
1:33:31
us before. You can see that it's given us all the primary location, the primary categories, and the secondary categories. So, cleanup services,
1:33:39
gardening services, mental health services. I know that'll definitely be in there. You need to see the categories
1:33:45
will change depending on where you are in the world as well, but perfect. We've got mental health services. So, that is
1:33:50
the another secondary category. Uh, let's go. Uh, therapeutic gardening
1:33:55
services. I wonder if that's going to be in there. And sometimes you won't be able to place it in there. Say, that
1:34:03
category. That's fine. Let's do the other ones here. And you want to add as many as possible. It will pen for a
1:34:08
little while because it needs to verify that. So, gardener and mental services, they need to see if that's correct. The
1:34:13
next thing here, as you can see, the business name is fine. The category is pending. What about the description?
1:34:18
Well, if you don't have one, you can see that the GPT has kind of helped us out and said, "Hey, do you want a description?" We can just say yes,
1:34:25
absolutely. And it should give us a description as well. Perfect.
1:34:33
Let's see if that's going to fit within it. It might be a tad too long, but let's see.
1:34:39
No, perfect. So, it's just got to fit under 770 characters. 750 characters, sorry.
1:34:47
Try to put the opening date. Uh, as much information the better. I think this was 2020.
1:34:54
Let's just go January day one. Save the phone number. The chat you can add if
1:35:00
you've got uh if you often use your WhatsApp or your phone number. For this,
1:35:06
I'll leave it alone because I know they don't like to do that. You can see here
1:35:12
we've got a couple of things here. So, we can hide the address from businesses.
1:35:17
So, sometimes we don't want to show our addresses. Maybe it's a our own home, the office. So, you can kind of get rid
1:35:23
of that. And then the service area, it's really important that you not only put the main area. So in this instance,
1:35:30
Melbourne, but they also go through the um eastern suburbs of Melbourne. So
1:35:36
let's see the ones that we want to concentrate, right? Perfect. So I know it's these ones here. So Ringwood, for
1:35:41
example, we want to add those categories in there. Uh we're going to go Ringwood, Victoria, Australia. Fantastic. Let's
1:35:48
have a look. We want to go to Cudon. And you want to go and do these things as
1:35:53
well. Victoria, make sure it's the right suburb of the right country as well. You don't want to get this thing confused.
1:36:01
Perfect. And so on and so forth. So, let's say you're a plumber. You want to put in all the service areas, not only
1:36:08
the city, but the suburbs or the locations, whatever they're called in your part of the world. Uh, the burrows,
1:36:15
let's say it. Um, and so on. Vermont. See, this is why you need to be careful.
1:36:20
There's a Vermont in USA and in Victoria as well. I want to make sure it's Victoria, Australia. Great. And again,
1:36:26
it's pending. It'll take a little while from this. So, from the business and the crowd, let's add from the business. Uh,
1:36:33
identified as womanowned. Sure. And we're going to save that. Perfect. Cool. So, now we've added as
1:36:40
much information as possible. Uh, there's never too little information. There's even the crowd one. Let's see what it suggests. LGTBQ
1:36:47
plus friendly. Sure. Let's do that. Great. Perfect. So, we've edited the
1:36:54
profile. That's fantastic. Now, the other thing that you want to do is upload photos. Like we said, we want to
1:36:59
get to a 100 photos, but start off with right away when you get it, whether that's your service, the people that you
1:37:05
work with, your employees, whatever photos you can take of your business and put it up here. Remember, treat this
1:37:11
like a social media profile. So, I've gone to the website and I've just gone a couple of got a couple of images here.
1:37:17
So, I'm going to save image as uh therapeutic gardening in Melbourne. These are pending. Obviously, they need
1:37:23
to make sure that it's okay. You can add a logo and a cover photo. So, let's see the cover photo that we
1:37:29
can add. We can probably use the same one on the website. Great. And the logo as well. Let's see what we had to do
1:37:35
that for the photos. Perfect. Now, we've edited the profile. The logo is taking a
1:37:41
little while to get approved, but that's okay. So, the other thing that you want to do, we've added a lot of photos. The
1:37:47
next thing is post. Now, this is part of when I said treat this like a social media profile. You can add a lot of
1:37:53
certain types of posts. For example, if we go to posts here and at the end, the last section, I'm going to show you how
1:37:59
to automate this. You can add a post and you can add an update, whatever that might be. You can add an offer. So,
1:38:05
let's say you have Black Friday sales or uh end of year financial years. Let's say you're having an event here. Please
1:38:12
add those in there. Do not forget about this. This is something that often gets underlooked and it can be incredibly
1:38:19
strong to do. It's one of those assets as well that should your website ever go down, hopefully it doesn't, you still
1:38:25
have your Google business profile with the updates with the offer that's going to continuously get you leads. But one
1:38:30
of the main things that you can do is add an update. So, what can be an update? I think an easy thing to do is
1:38:36
just to rewrite your blog content in less than 1,500 characters in length and
1:38:42
place it in there. So, let's do that right now very quickly. So, they've got a blog here of why is hoarding bad? So,
1:38:48
what is it actually going to do to you and what should you do? Right? So, I'm going to just copy this whole thing. I'm
1:38:53
going to go back to chat GPT. I'm going to paste the content in there and I'm going to say this very, very easy
1:38:59
prompt. We're going to say, rewrite this for a Google My Business post. Make sure that it follows the same
1:39:05
tone of voice and it adds the same value from the blog post. And make sure that it's less than,450
1:39:11
characters in length. The reason why I said, 1450 characters in length and not, 1500 is because I
1:39:19
want to give myself a little bit of leeway, right? So, he's a polished version. So, I can grab that. I can go
1:39:25
back to the Google business profile. Place it in there. Now, I can add a button here and I can either do that to
1:39:31
call user, sign up, whatever you want it to do. What I'm going to do actually is learn more and I'm going to link it to
1:39:37
the actual blog post. That way, if somebody wants to learn a little bit more, uh, they can do. It's
1:39:44
also a sneaky little way to get a little bit more traffic to your website. You want to add an image there. So, let's
1:39:50
select one of the images from the website. And I'm just going to drop it in there. And I'm going to post it. So,
1:39:57
now on the post, if I go, it's submitted there. It's reviewing. And in a second, it should come up there already. You
1:40:03
want to do that at least once a week. It's really important to do that if you do have certain products. This is where
1:40:10
you place it in there. They don't unfortunately. We can edit the services. So the services is really really
1:40:16
important that you do. So custom service here for example uh we have therapeutic gardening. Uh we have a uh support
1:40:26
coordination. So this is NDIS support coordination. And you see how this
1:40:31
wasn't a subcategory in the main categories of the business but we can place it as a as a service we provide.
1:40:37
That's really important for you to do. if you can't add it underneath the uh secondary categories. Perfect. So that's
1:40:44
the main things that they have therapeutic gardening and NDIS support coordination. Fantastic. They also help with uh actually hoarding and scholar.
1:40:51
So let's do the whole great. So now I've added all these services there. Fantastic. Um you need to make sure that
1:40:57
the services that are listed in Google business profile, they're also mentioned on the website. They do need to correlate. So I've done the services. If
1:41:04
you do have a direct booking button, you can add that link there. So, let's say you have a button to submit your form or
1:41:10
call you or a Calendarly link to make a meeting. That's where you place it in there. They don't. So, I'm going to leave that alone. There is a Q&A
1:41:17
section. This is a little bit tricky because there's no point of you asking those questions, but you need to get people to ask those questions. If you've
1:41:23
got a friend or not, I would highly recommend they ask you the most frequently asked questions about your service so you can answer those. So,
1:41:29
what we're going to do is ask for reviews. This is one of the final sections on the Google Business profile optimization. This is one of the most
1:41:36
important things. You have your review link here and you have your QR code which is really important. You can also
1:41:42
make your own QR code if you don't want to download that. So I can save that as an image for example and I'm going to go to QR code for my inclusion for Google
1:41:50
business profile. This QR code you can place in your pamphlets in your card but make it really really easy for the for
1:41:57
the uh reviewer to actually access it. Right. So I'm going to be recording on my phone. So I'm going to show you what
1:42:03
this looks like leaving a review here. So now I'm on my phone. I'm recording and I open the camera app. I'm going to
1:42:10
perfect scroll scan that. I'm going to press that button. Then you can see that that's taking me instantly to leave a
1:42:18
review for that Google business profile. Right? That is what you want. That's how easy you want to make it to the user to
1:42:23
leave a review. Right? Don't make it any harder. Don't tell them to, hey, can you look us up on Google business profile?
1:42:30
Please do not do that. Just make it very easy for them. That's going to help your life out. quite a lot. We've claimed it.
1:42:36
We added the primary, secondary categories. We're asking for reviews uh from our customers with our QR code. We
1:42:42
respond to negative and positive. Uh we're going to post updates like I just showed you once a week. You're going to
1:42:49
upload fresh images like we just did as well. And you're going to treat it like a social media profile. With those
1:42:54
fundamentals, you are not going to fail with Google My Business.
1:43:00
Okay. The next is local citations. This is local backlinks, links from websites
1:43:05
that are in the same country, in the same location. The main thing that you need to keep in mind here is ensure a
1:43:11
nap consistency. NAP stands for name, address, and phone number. That needs to stay the same across all the
1:43:17
directories. I'm going to show you how to find directories as well. Um, you
1:43:22
want to keep them updated, but that's the main thing. You don't have to do this once a month. once every year or
1:43:27
once at least 6 months. You can probably do this and it's going to be enough. So, I'm going to show you how to get free
1:43:34
ones and then I'm going to show you how to hand it off to a service that's very well known that does this automatically
1:43:39
for you. And if you want to provide it to the service, you can also hand it off to that service as well. Let me show you what I mean. This is the local listings
1:43:46
pro, a custom GBT that you can just give it your business URL or the website information and it's going to show you
1:43:52
all the relevant free online business directories that you can get. It's going to ask you a few questions
1:43:58
about It's going to ask you a few questions about the business. Just ensure that it finds the right ones for you and you're going to hit enter yes or
1:44:05
no or tell us some information. So, perfect. I've got a couple of listings here. Clickability, uh, disability
1:44:12
providers, uh, my care space, and a bunch of other ones. And I'm going to say great, uh, now give me normal
1:44:19
listings.
1:44:30
And now it's got a bunch that are a little bit more broad but still really good and still local to Australia. So
1:44:36
we've got true local hotfrog.com.au start local Aussie web and you get the
1:44:41
idea. So I would recommend you put this into a Google sheet for example. You can
1:44:46
do this with every client if you want. You're going to paste it in here. Uh, let's get the directory name, the URL,
1:44:52
and let's make the notes here. Let's clean this up. A little rule on the dropdown, and we're going to say, uh,
1:44:59
done. So, we'll pick a random one here. We're going to pick aweb.com. Uh, that
1:45:04
is this website here. I can't show you all of them because everyone's slightly different in how you need to update the
1:45:11
information to the website, but usually they'll all have add your business button. It'll be either in the main menu
1:45:17
or somewhere at the bottom. You can see here that you just need to add all your information the same for all of them. So
1:45:23
the email uh business verification person, who's the owner, the business information, the phone number, website.
1:45:29
The main thing is to keep that consistency of the nap, the name, address, and the phone number. It does
1:45:35
take a little while to go through all of them, but it does make a huge difference, particularly if it's a brand new business website. It'll get more
1:45:42
trust by having local citations. So let's say we did Aussie web. I just want to go here and go done. So I make sure
1:45:48
that I don't go back and have to do it again when it's already processed. Now if you are doing this for more than one
1:45:55
or two businesses. So if it's your own business, you can probably do this yourself manually. It's worth it. If you cannot be bothered or you want to
1:46:02
provide this as a service, which many agencies do and there a lot of them use this exact service. You can go to bright
1:46:08
local and go to citation builder. Local citation builder is what we're doing here. and they're telling you that it's
1:46:14
you're enhancing your visibility, which you actually do. What you want to make sure before you get this service is you
1:46:20
want to make sure that the countries that you support is the country that you're doing this local SEO for. If it's
1:46:26
not in there, you're either going to have to go to somewhere to Fiverr to find someone that will do this for you.
1:46:32
This is something that I would trust someone in Fiverr to do it because it's not extremely complicated. Um, and yeah,
1:46:38
if you go to the pricing stuff, just so you get an understanding here, you are doing about $3.20 per site. So, you can
1:46:47
do over 1,000 sites apparently, although that sounds a little bit too much with this uh for, you know, around $2,000 or
1:46:55
$200, but it really depends. You can pick, right? So, what a lot of agencies tend to do is they just add a search
1:47:01
charge, so an extra 50% or $10 per site, and they get Bright Local to do it. These are probably the only guys that I
1:47:08
would trust with local citations. You can book a demo, you can call out to them, but if you can't be bothered doing
1:47:14
it yourself, you can always outsource it to someone like this. And finally, to keep it nice and easy, we need to
1:47:20
optimize the website for locality. This is really easy and maybe I've over complicated this with this whole thing,
1:47:26
but essentially what you really want to do is make sure that every single page
1:47:32
or services if you're a local business has the local name to it. Let me show
1:47:37
you what I mean here. So, if I'm looking at this same business, my inclusion, and they offer therapeutic gardening, that
1:47:43
is okay. But the thing here is while it's a.com.au website, which indicates
1:47:48
it's in Australia, it's not granular enough. we really need to hone down that
1:47:53
it should be therapeutic gardening in Melbourne, right? And even even if we do have a look at the metadata, I'm going
1:47:59
to tell you how to get this little plug-in in a second. Don't go ahead and get it now. But the title tag here just
1:48:05
says therapeutic gardening. So when you are building these websites or when you want to optimize it, you just need to
1:48:10
make sure that you add that locality keyword to it. So, it should be therapeutic gardening in Melbourne,
1:48:16
professional therapeutic gardening services in Melbourne, and it's got to be between uh 45 and 61 characters in
1:48:22
length. Same thing with the headings. It just says therapeutic gardening. Ideally, I want to add that Melbourne
1:48:27
aspect to it. Fundamentally, that is the main thing when it comes to making your website a little bit more
1:48:34
optimized for locality. This is a dog training business in Melbourne as well.
1:48:39
Uh it's got.com.au and it's kind of got the same issue here. Here we're actually going to optimize this website a little
1:48:44
bit more, but you can see that it just says empowering your dog to success. It's not really definitive of where this
1:48:51
is. If we have a look at the title, it just says ethical dog training. Ideally, again, we want to add that local keyword
1:48:57
to it. All right. There's one tool here that I'm going to give you as well. It's another GPT
1:49:03
and it's the local business website analyzer. Right. So, this is going to
1:49:08
you're going to give it the website and it's going to crawl through it. take a it's going to take a look at the website and understand the main services you
1:49:14
offer. You might have to prompt it to actually take a look at the site itself and crawl it. But this is already going
1:49:20
to tell you what what it found in the site. Um so puppy school including puppy training leash reactivity general
1:49:26
obedience and that's all the stuff they have. So now you need to confirm a few things. So yes, those are the services
1:49:32
and those are the locations that I want to concentrate on. So here now it's giving us an understanding of what we're doing right and what we're doing wrong.
1:49:39
And it's going to give us a page by page review. So the location uh of the homepage or it doesn't mention Fern tree
1:49:46
gully which is the location or Boronia in the H1 Tyler for example gives you an
1:49:51
opportunity. It even tells you dog training in upper fern tree gully. So it's going to give you a whole step-by-step guide on what you need to
1:49:57
do to make your website more locally friendly. Don't trust this blindly, but
1:50:03
it's going to give you a really good start for you to start optimizing your website from a more local aspect. And the last thing I want you to remember is
1:50:10
that the services and the locations in which you say you offer and where you offer need to match on your website as
1:50:17
well as in your Google business profile. That is those things. So with those three main things which is Google
1:50:23
business profile, local citations and optimizing the website from a local perspective, you will do really really
1:50:29
well when it comes to local SEO.
1:50:35
Next, we have the thing that terrifies a lot of people, which is technical SEO.
Technical SEO
1:50:41
This is very very important like the rest really. Uh, but I want to simplify it. Now, I want to make it very clear
1:50:47
that this is what I think technical SEO is. If you need to start coding or really change some critical components
1:50:53
of the actual website, change the theme and whatnot, then that's really the web developer's kind of responsibility. I
1:51:00
don't believe that falls under the SEO's responsibility. Um, that being said,
1:51:05
what I'm going to do is really narrow it down into the next four following points
1:51:12
for technical SEO. These are the things that I look at, what I consider technical SEO. There are more things you
1:51:18
can focus in, but I think with these four main fundamentals, you can really make the most of a website. Now, here's
1:51:26
the main thing of why we want to do technical SEO in a bit of an audit. I think the best way I can explain this is
1:51:33
with a metaphor is a lot of people's websites or a lot of people want to compete in Formula 1, let's say, but
1:51:40
their car is a Prius. So their website's a little bit the same where if you're in a very competitive niche and your
1:51:47
competitors have a really good technical and on-site SEO, your website need to be
1:51:52
needs to be up to standard. Otherwise, you're not going to be able to compete hard as you try. And technical SEO is a
1:51:57
very important component. So we're going to go through the basics. That being said, the first one that we're going to check out is website loading time speed.
1:52:05
And this is really important because your website feels faster to you. That's
1:52:11
because when you go on a website quite frequently and we often go on our web on our own websites quite frequently modern
1:52:18
web browsers like Chrome, Motilla, Firefox, etc. They'll save the files
1:52:23
locally on your computer so that next time that you go on that website, it can
1:52:29
just spin them up a lot quicker. Now the difference is when somebody new goes onto your website the images, the CSS,
1:52:36
everything else has to be called from the actual hosting platforms and the
1:52:42
service. So that will take slower and first impressions really matter when it comes to your website. So you want to
1:52:48
make sure that your website is really quick. So you want to test it with different tools to make sure that you
1:52:53
get an unbiased opinion. The way to do that in my opinion is with two website loading time speed. And there's two free
1:53:00
ones that I recommend. GTMetrics tends to be the industry standard when it
1:53:05
comes to website loading time speed, and you also have Google's version. I'm going to leave you both. The reason why
1:53:11
I want to test with two tools is because you want to have no or 100% assured that
1:53:18
your website is actually loading really quickly or really slowly. Sometimes you get really different results. And if
1:53:23
that's the case, then the error might be somewhere else. So, let's get the website that we've been working on for a
1:53:29
little bit. And I'll show you a, you know, relatively good loading website and then a bad one so you understand
1:53:34
what it looks like. So, I'm going to grab the link there and go to um run and I'm going to do the same website in
1:53:41
Google Page Speed Insights. GTMetrics is free. They've got a paid version. If
1:53:46
you're doing one, two, three websites, the free version is more than enough. You don't have to buy anything. And
1:53:52
Google Page Speed Insights is completely free. So you see it's analyzing the
1:53:57
website. It's choosing a server location like Vancouver. You can change the server location with a paid version, but
1:54:04
it doesn't really matter. We just want an unbiased opinion on how fast your website or slowly the website is
1:54:10
loading. And you can see here that it's giving us a report. So it's giving us a grade of B from A B CDE E F all the way
1:54:16
to D. If your website is lower than a B, you've got a problem and you need to sort it out immediately. A slow loading
1:54:23
website isn't only critical for SEO, but your conversions, which we're going to go through in this little section as
1:54:28
well. But you can see here that it's telling us the website is loading at uh 1.9
1:54:34
seconds, which is good. If it's loading any slower, it'll tell you here if it's
1:54:39
loading slower than 3 seconds, you've got an issue. You are missing a lot of conversions and you are leaving money on
1:54:45
the table. So, this is really critical. Now, GTMetrics is kind enough that it gives you a report as to why it might be
1:54:51
slowing very slowly. So, I can see here that I can probably even increase the website loading time speed by optimizing
1:54:58
this video, right? I can probably throw it in an optimizer, make sure this is a lot lighter as a file without it losing
1:55:06
um so much of the quality. That's fine, but it's slowing down the website a
1:55:12
little bit. That's already something that I can do. Let's take a look at the other test. uh Google page speed insights and I like this because it
1:55:18
tells you the difference between mobile and desktop and you should always optimize for mobile first. Google
1:55:26
actually sets the standard of mobile first. It deems that more important than your desktop and it does that because
1:55:32
overall generally in the internet people crawl or people go on the websites on mobile more than on the desktop unless
1:55:40
it's a really B2B type business. But you can see here there's a difference. the mobile is loading way, way too slow. You
1:55:47
want mobile at least at 80. The same with desktop when it comes to Google's components, right? The problem is that
1:55:53
for a lot of people, all this data telling you how slowly it's loading can
1:55:59
sound a little bit like gibberish, but no problems. I've got you covered. All I want you to do is you want to share this
1:56:05
report and you should be able to download as a PDF, right? So I want you to download that PDF report and within
1:56:12
the resources that I've provided there is a GT GTMetric report analyzer. What
1:56:18
this is going to do is just transform all that difficult report from the
1:56:24
GTMetrics report into understandable actionable insight. Let me show you. So I've placed the PDF report in the G in
1:56:32
the custom GPT. This is what it looks like by the way. It's just a direct copy of the other one and it's got all the
1:56:38
information in there. I don't even know what a lot of these things in are and I don't need to know. So, I've got that
1:56:43
pasted in there and I'm going to hit run and that custom GBT knows what to do. It's going to take a look at it,
1:56:49
understand it, and it should give you easy to understand somewhat non-technical insights into these are
1:56:56
the steps you need to follow to fix your website. It's reviewing quick issues and
1:57:01
it's going to give us a pretty easy report. You can either then do your fixes yourself or you can give this kind
1:57:08
of thing to your website developer if you have one. So it's giving us an overall report. Not tragic, not great.
1:57:14
Room for easy wins. So put your static side behind a CDN. Um
1:57:23
there you go. So compress the images. We're going to help you how to do that. Low priority. So it's giving you a step
1:57:29
by step on how to fix things. Convert your images to WEBP files. I obvious say
1:57:34
that I said that when we were building the um the video uh video hygiene on the
1:57:39
homepage compress it like I said. So it's given me the same advice that I recommended and it's even given you a
1:57:45
checklist at the end. So nice and easy to follow. Right now let me show you what a website looks like when it's
1:57:51
loading very slowly. So I know this one I tend to use an as an example. I'm
1:57:57
going to go back to GTMetrics. I'm just going to get a new report of a new website and paste it in there and it's
1:58:03
going to do the run. Let's do the same with page speed insights. Ideally, they're both loading slowly.
1:58:11
If you need whilst this is loading, if you need a third test just to see what's going on, there's one more free test
1:58:18
which is called Pingdom Tools. And it's always good to have a spare one in case
1:58:23
it's uh both of the test results are really different. At least you have a third one to kind of tell you for sure
1:58:30
how the website is loading. So this one is Ethical Dog Training, a website in Australia, and we are testing it from
1:58:37
Vancouver. Okay, so now this is at a Dgrading. You
1:58:42
see the fully time loaded, it's 9.3 seconds. Way, way too slow. In fact, I
1:58:49
would go as far as say it's critically slow. And this is really resulting in
1:58:54
really poor SEO and really poor conversions. There's also something else attributing to poor conversions for this
1:59:00
website, but we'll get to that in a second. Um, and again, it's going to give us a report. I don't want to go
1:59:06
through the report. I'm going to go share. I'm going to go download full report. And again, I'm going to give it
1:59:11
to GTMetrics. I want to verify that report with Page Speed Insights. And Page Speed Insights also tells me that
1:59:18
it's very slow. So out of everything for example that I looked at all the websites for this guy this website if I
1:59:25
was doing a audit I would tell them that the first thing they need to do is fix
1:59:30
the website loading time speed. So I'm going to start a new chat with the same GPT and I'm going to throw the new
1:59:36
report in there. Right now I have built you guys a bit of a checklist.
1:59:44
So when you are doing your optimization as you should go through it one thing
1:59:50
that you can do is for example you can give it the URL if you are reviewing uh let's say we're reviewing this website
1:59:56
here and we want to copy the URL of the homepage and we want to paste it in
2:00:03
there and we want to say loading slowly slowly
2:00:08
and then we want to say uh look at report and we can also copy Copy the
2:00:14
report in here. Let's go to GTMetrics. Copy link report
2:00:20
and then share the screenshot or link whatever that is. And the priority is definitely high in there. So, it's just
2:00:26
a nice little way to keep track of everything. You can make a copy of this. It's a very simple uh table. Don't get
2:00:32
excited, but I want you to keep track of it so you keep yourself accountable. You need to fix these things. Let's have a
2:00:39
look at the GTMetrics uh understanding that it gave us. So
2:00:45
cool. So this is giving us uh another report here. High priorities shrink and modernize your images. So what does this
2:00:52
mean? I want to kind of do a tiny bit of image SEO here with you guys together. So if we take a look at the Dmetrics
2:00:59
report and we take a look at what's going on. We can see here the URLs. It kind of tells you what's the culprit.
2:01:06
And one of the culprits is the fact that this PNG image is way too heavy. You can see how slow the image is loading and my
2:01:13
internet's not that bad. So, how do I fix this? There's two ways you can fix this. You can download the image. So,
2:01:20
I'm going to save the image uh as Smiling Dog. And then you can convert it
2:01:26
to a WEBP file, right? And you convert it to a WEBP file. If you've got some
2:01:31
sort of plugin, you can do that automatically in your backend. It just it depends what kind of website builder
2:01:37
that you have. But a simple way to do this is to upload it into convert io.
2:01:42
You can go to webp and you can convert it right and I'll show you the
2:01:48
difference between the file sizes in a second. But that's going to convert it to a webp. That file webp was developed
2:01:55
by Google to keep websites speedy on the internet. It doesn't reduce the quality.
2:02:01
It just makes it more friendly, more a lot more lighter. So I'm going to download that.
2:02:07
So now if I go to both here. Yeah. And
2:02:12
that is the PNG. That's the WEBP file. So I'm going to put them side by side so
2:02:17
you can see that they don't really change in quality whatsoever. Right? So
2:02:23
the one on the left is the PNG, the one on the right is the WEBP. And I think
2:02:29
they're practically the same. Right? But when it goes to how light or big they
2:02:35
are, the the WEBP file is now miles and miles lighter. I mean, from 3.3
2:02:42
megabytes to 1.8 kilobytes, like insanely lighter. Now, there might be
2:02:48
the case where you're in a weird website builder that doesn't take a WEBP file because it's a relatively new file
2:02:55
format. If that's the case, your only other option is to compress the WEBP file and you can use something like tiny
2:03:01
PNG. For example, I'm going to drop the PNG file in here. You can do up to 10
2:03:07
free images, I think a day or more. And this is going to start converting it and optimize. Sorry, optimizing, not
2:03:13
converting it. You can see it's saved 70%. So, it's made it. It's reduced the file size to 77%. Perfect. So, you can
2:03:21
do that. Upload that image. Delete the other one from your website. Quick optimization. So that's the first thing
2:03:26
you should do when it comes to uh technical SEO.
2:03:35
Next one is the meta data. So we're looking at things like title tags, H1, metad descriptions, and a clear
2:03:41
structure. I think this just comes with time understanding this, but we're going to go through quickly in a couple of
2:03:47
sites so you can determine the difference what a good one looks like and what a bad one looks like. To do
2:03:52
this, we want to download a free tool and the tool is called SEO Wallet. I've
2:03:59
got it in this tab here. Again, this is going to be in the assets where I'm leaving everything. I want you to
2:04:04
install this. Once you install the SEO wallet extension, 100% free, one of the
2:04:10
handiest tools I use every day, you want to go to the website that you are
2:04:16
reviewing. So, let's have a look at Align Lending. If I put my mouse all the way to the left, you're going to see a
2:04:21
blue bar come out. That is the extension. And we get an overview right away. This is the metadata. So, mortgage
2:04:28
brokers in Michigan, Allian Lending. That's not too bad. We've got what they do, the location, Align Lending, the
2:04:35
meta description as well. Uh, the only thing I would change here is to add a call to action in the meta description.
2:04:42
So, apply now, get your free consultation, whatever that is. I want
2:04:47
you to go to the heading optimization. You see here that I've got a H1 that
2:04:53
says homepage and then a H another H1 that says align your dreams for home ownership. Two things here. Technically,
2:05:01
every single page should only have one H1. You can have multiple H2s, multiple
2:05:06
H3s, but generally the main thing is having one H1. It's not the end of the
2:05:11
world if you have multiples, but try to keep it with one. And the second thing is that your H1 is not a tagline. This
2:05:19
for example, align your dreams of ownership. That is a tagline because H1
2:05:27
is a really important keyword for SEO association. What we're doing here is essentially telling Google a really
2:05:34
important keyword that I want to associate myself with is align your dreams of ownership. And the reality is
2:05:40
that nobody in the world is doing that search, right? So really what should be
2:05:46
in the H1 is, you know, um, mortgage experts or home mortgage experts in
2:05:53
Michigan, right? That's the key word there. And then that is fine as a H3,
2:05:58
H4, whatever. But a H1 is really important. That's the main thing out of that. Uh, you can have a look at the
2:06:04
other things. You can always ask GPT what these other things mean, but I just want you to concentrate on those things.
2:06:10
So again, making sure that the overview looks okay, that if that's too long, that's going to look red. The same thing
2:06:16
with this, the metad description, add a call to action at the end. And make sure the H1's are in alignment. One more
2:06:23
thing here. You see how this section here goes from H2 to a H4 and it's in
2:06:30
red. That's because the best structure from this is sequential, meaning it's got to go from H1 to H2 to H3, then to
2:06:38
H4. Again, those little items aren't probably going to make you rank one
2:06:44
overnight, but we want to start kind of joining these little 1% improvements.
2:06:50
So, that for the most part is your meta data done. You want to go through each page and understand that they all are
2:06:57
doing the right thing, have the right keyword and that sort of things. The more you do that, the more you kind of
2:07:03
get the hang of it. So that just kind of comes with practice. I want to show you another one here. So the same one, the ethical dog training.
2:07:09
And we see here that for the heading stuff, they start with a H2 and it moves
2:07:15
to empower your dog to success. I know they are they're a dog training business in Melbourne, Australia, and they don't
2:07:20
mention any of that. So you can see now why they might not be getting the right traffic is because well we're not really
2:07:26
telling Google to associate ourselves with the right keywords and the title tag says home ethical dog training
2:07:33
that's missing a meta description. So we start seeing well okay if we're adding all these errors of course we're not
2:07:39
really ranking very well right and if you add all these things positively they're going to make a big difference.
2:07:45
The other thing that I want you to check and this is going to be the most technical thing out of this whole tutorial and that is schema.
2:07:53
Right now schema is essentially a bit of code
2:08:00
that tells the search engines instantly and exactly what is on your page without
2:08:06
guessing. It's not to say that without schema you won't rank, but with schema
2:08:12
you're making the search engine's job a lot easier. We've seen a lot of businesses just improve their rankings
2:08:17
by adding the right schema. Um, and it scares people a little bit because when I show you the code, it seems really
2:08:23
weird, but it isn't. It's really quite simple. So, let me show you how to find
2:08:29
it and where you would place it. So, if I have a look at a line lending and I look at our trusty SEO wallet, there's a
2:08:35
section here that says uh structured data. So, structured data is also called
2:08:40
schema or schema markup. Same thing. And you can see that it's found different types of schemas. Play schema, financial
2:08:47
organization schema, website schema. So it's telling Google in a JSON file
2:08:53
format which it loves exactly what this business is about. So
2:08:58
there's no confusing um you've got the postal code, the address, and all the
2:09:04
things. So it's a lot easier for Google to understand these things. So this one has the right schema. Let's have a look
2:09:10
at one that might not have the right schema. Now, I've purposely gone on like the third page of the uh search term
2:09:20
uh home loans in Michigan to find this page, this website here, because if I go
2:09:25
and I look at the schema, they have no schema. Is that the reason why they're not ranking? It's probably one of them.
2:09:32
But I wanted to do that so I could show you. Another test that you can do is an
2:09:37
official test from Google uh going rich results test. So, I'm going to test the website that doesn't have any schema
2:09:44
into it so I can show you what that looks like, right? There's also I'll
2:09:50
leave this schema.org validator thing here. Uh, it tells you all the different types of schemas. Essentially, for
2:09:57
everything that you can think of, there's probably a schema for reviews, for a plumbing surf service, a law
2:10:06
service, whatever you think there's the right schema. The more niche the schema,
2:10:11
the better you giving an understanding of Google of what it is that you have. Local business schema is really
2:10:16
important as well. It's a little bit complicated, but it's really well worth getting your head around. Um, let's go
2:10:22
back to the validator here. Rich results test. Okay, so there is some schema here and perfect. I'm glad that there was a
2:10:29
bit of disconnection. This is why it's good checking the data from two different things. I blindly trusted our
2:10:36
tool data for uh SEO wallet sorry but there actually is some schema here local
2:10:41
business local business and organization but I know they're missing one now for me there is way too many different types
2:10:49
of schemas that I can remember and I don't have to right just with a simple prompt I can understand all the ones
2:10:56
that I need so I'm going to go to chatgpt I'm going to make sure that I've got enabled web search I'm going to
2:11:01
paste the URL that we might be doing some SEO for. And I'm going to say this simple prompt.
2:11:07
Have a look at this website and tell me all the different schemas that it needs from an SEO perspective. It's that
2:11:13
simple. If you're wondering, by the way, this little tool here is called Super Whisper. I know I'm going to get people
2:11:18
asking me. I'm going to give that to ChachiBT. It's going to understand the contents of the website and it's telling
2:11:25
me I need organization or better uh bank or credit union schema, local business
2:11:32
schema, financial product schema, mortgage loan schema. So there's all these different types of schemas that
2:11:38
will only help the website. Let me show you what the code looks like. So I say um build the local
2:11:48
business schema.
2:11:57
And that is what the code looks like. Now what you need to do is inject that into the header of that page.
2:12:05
What I want to make clear here is that one schema just on the homepage isn't
2:12:11
enough because all these different products for example they have different schemas because the onpage content is
2:12:18
different and therefore it requires different schema that uh explains what's
2:12:24
on the content of that individual page. Do I need schema for absolutely everything my contact my about page? No.
2:12:32
just the money pages or the pages that we did transactional research for. You
2:12:37
see how I'm joining everything together? That's not bad actually, but you get the idea. So, not for everything, but for your most important pages. How you add
2:12:44
it to the page header is really dependent on the CMS. So, you're going
2:12:49
to have to GBT that or Google that, I'm afraid. But that's the main thing that I want you to realize that schema, get
2:12:56
that into your head. The final thing in technical SEO, and a lot of people don't
2:13:03
consider this as SEO at all, but I do. I think it's really important, and that is conversion rate optimization. How many
2:13:09
conversions you're getting for the traffic that you're getting good a good ranking website is kind of
2:13:17
useless if it's not converting really well. Because sometimes when we're doing SEO, whilst we wait for SEO to kind of
2:13:25
take action and start increasing our traffic, what we can start doing is getting more leads for the same amount
2:13:31
of traffic that we're getting. And that's the art of conversion rate optimization. I used to work with a guy that was so good at this, he would just
2:13:38
look at a site and improve the conversion right away. I'm not as good and you're probably not that good as
2:13:43
well, but that's okay. I've prepared a GPT to help you out with this. Let's go through the basics first,
2:13:49
right? So the main thing with conversion rate optimization is you need to always
2:13:57
consider to never underestimate stupidity in large numbers, particularly in the internet. And I know that sounds
2:14:02
terrible, but what I mean here is you need to make it stupidly simple for somebody to understand instantly and
2:14:08
exactly what is on your page, what your business is, and the action that you want them to take. So, for example, I'm
2:14:14
doing this as a clear conver as a clear comparison between this one and this one, the same service, but I can
2:14:21
guarantee that these guys are going to get a lot more conversions simply because the second I land on the site,
2:14:27
it's a bunch of dog dogs and it says Melbourne's number one dog trainers. Get started. It's telling me what to do.
2:14:33
Okay, perfect. Great. Whereas this one just says empowering your dog to success.
2:14:41
Okay, what do you want me to do? And I know you might think that sounds silly. You clearly scroll. The thing is that if
2:14:48
you add any type of heat mapping software like Hot Jar, Microsoft Clarity, I can guarantee that the more
2:14:55
you get people to scroll, the more you lose people, right? So, you want to make it instantly clear what they're supposed
2:15:00
to be doing. So, right away, I would add a call to action here saying, "Contact us now." Something like that. So have a
2:15:07
look at your website and see if you made it really clear. One other thing that I personally don't like is too many calls
2:15:14
to action. It's called the paradox of choice. It's a bit like when you go into Netflix to watch something and there's a
2:15:19
billion things to watch. So you end up watching the same reruns of friends or you don't know what to watch. Here the
2:15:25
same thing. I know they offer these three services so they want to do that. But I would really focus on one call to
2:15:31
action and I can guarantee that the conversion rates will increase. So this is all well
2:15:37
and good but what happens if you don't this doesn't come naturally to you and that's okay. What I want you to do is I
2:15:44
want you to get this uh Chrome extension that is called go full page. It takes a
2:15:49
screenshot of the entire page. Right. We're going to take a screenshot and you
2:15:56
see it's going through and taking an entire screenshot of the page. We then want to download it as a PNG.
2:16:03
And then I have a custom GPT that's going to help you here. We're going to
2:16:08
turn it into GPT5 auto if you can, if you've got it available. And I'm going
2:16:14
to drop the screenshot here. And I'm also going to give it the URL.
2:16:21
I don't think you can do two at once, but it might look at the screenshot and go through the URL as well. And it
2:16:27
should give you a bit of advice. That's the beautiful thing about uh O models.
2:16:33
They can do a lot of things. They can look at an image and tell you.
2:16:39
Perfect. So, let's read the first sentence and see if I was right with every anything. Right. So, it says first
2:16:45
impression of value proposition issue. The hero headline says empowering your doctor success, which is cute but vague.
2:16:51
And I couldn't agree more. Success at what? Obedience, behavior, correction, peace of mind. A visitor shouldn't have
2:16:57
to scroll to guess what's on offer. Again, I couldn't agree more. Why it matters? People bounce if they don't
2:17:03
instantly know. So, here are the recommendations. Write the headline to be crystal clear. Positive dog training
2:17:10
for obedience, reactivity, and anxiety. A subline helping your dog with thrive with ethical reward-based training. And
2:17:17
add a visible call to action. CTA, book a consultation, see training program.
2:17:22
So, it's already said all the things that I kind of said, and you can read through it here. So do this exercise
2:17:28
with your website or any websites that you're trying to do particularly in the first fold. It's really important. Your
2:17:33
website might really convert really well and that's fine. And the types of the conversion rate um whether it's 1.4 2%
2:17:42
3% really changes between the niche. So I can't really give you a good conversion number. But do this exercise
2:17:49
and you're going to get more conversions for the traffic that you are already getting.
2:17:54
And I think for me, those four elements, if you just go through those, your website will thank you for it. You're
2:18:00
not only going to rank higher, but you're going to get more conversions as a result.
Link Building
2:18:07
The next section that we're going to touch on is link building or back linking. This seems to be the black
2:18:12
magic of SEO. People either run away with it, run away from it because it can get a little bit scary, or they just
2:18:17
don't want to touch it because they don't know how to do it. And I think it'd be summarized in really four main
2:18:23
things that I've got here. The first one is I believe there are two main ways to
2:18:28
get some backlinks. Sure, there are more, but these are the main two. You can either do it yourself by doing the
2:18:33
manual outreach, trying to do guest post, partnerships, PR, local outreach. This takes some
2:18:40
time. Yes, you can automate this, like automate the manual or the outreach, but
2:18:45
I've seen some absolute horror stories when you do that. So, if
2:18:51
you're going to do your own backlinking, be careful. And in a second, I'm going to show you how to get started with
2:18:57
that. And number two is outsource it to a trusted entity. The dirty little secret of SEO is that any agency that
2:19:04
you've hired, there's probably a 99% chance that they just bought the backlink from someone else, another
2:19:10
website that does that only or another agency that does that because the truth is that good backlinking takes some
2:19:16
time. You need the connections. You need to be have a bit of a network of websites that you can reach out to. And
2:19:21
if you don't have that, it can be very difficult. I buy backlinks all the time. Just make sure you do it from reputable
2:19:27
sources. Again, I'm going to show you a couple of sources that I recommend. I buy links all the time and it works
2:19:32
great when done correctly. The main thing that you need to know is that quality will always beat quantity,
2:19:40
right? So, one relevant backlink from a high reputable website beats 100 spammy
2:19:45
back links. If you've been in this space for long enough, you might have seen an ad or somebody might have approached you saying, "Hey, I can get you a,000 back
2:19:52
links for a hundred bucks or $1,000." If that's the case, politely run the other
2:19:58
way. The thing here is that if your website gets associated with really bad quality backlinks or websites, then your
2:20:05
website's just going to be one of those bad quality websites. Relevance is also key here. You want to
2:20:11
aim for sites within your industry, locality, or at least your niche. For
2:20:17
example, if you have a website that is all about how to train dogs and you provide that as a service, maybe don't
2:20:23
get a link from a website that sells computer gaming gear. It just doesn't make any contextual relevance. So, some
2:20:29
quick red flags to avoid is if somebody comes to you with a cheap link building
2:20:34
package, it's not to say that it's always going to be bad if it's cheap, but that should be a red flag for you to
2:20:40
really do the due diligence and check the quality of those links. Again, irrelevant sites with zero opportunity
2:20:45
do not get those. And if a website has a sudden spike in backlinks and it wasn't natural, there's an issue there. At
2:20:52
least there's something that you need to dive in further. So, all well and good. How do we get our first set of backlinks
2:20:58
if we don't want to pay for them? Well,
2:21:03
a very simple and easy strategy that you can do is get yourself on featured.com.
2:21:09
Featured have bought out a website that used to be called Harrow. help a reporter out. And essentially what they do is they place publishers with subject
2:21:16
matter experts. They ask questions and if the subject matter expert answers that questions in detail, they'll get
2:21:23
sourced and get a backlink in return. I've done it many times and got a few free backlinks that are high quality.
2:21:29
Let me show you how it works. You're going to create an account. Whilst I've got a paid version, you can
2:21:35
get the free version and allow you to submit, I think, three questions a month. Now the main thing here is to
2:21:40
have a look at the questions tab. Delete all the categories and here you can see the publicators. So you see business
2:21:47
insider for example is asking a question. Obviously not all the questions are going to be something that you can answer. So you have to filter
2:21:52
through these. What I would do is put yourself a reminder to once a month or the at the beginning of the month or at
2:21:58
the end to go through these and use your three free answers. So or questions. Here you see I've got three out of three
2:22:04
remaining. They've got a lot of paid features that allows you to answer as many as you want, but we'll leave that
2:22:09
for another video. So, for example, I want to go through and see what I can actually answer because it's in my
2:22:15
expertise. And if you look down, sometimes you'll see that your profile
2:22:20
appears in one of them. And that's because they have seen or they think that this is a question that relates to
2:22:26
you. Let's have a quick look here. Uh some years ago, the maker movement was very prominent. There's magazine make
2:22:33
focus concept. I'm curious how companies are currently using the concept to spur innovation in a way technology like AI
2:22:40
or AI generation. That's why they thought it was to me. But let's keep going. See what else I can find.
2:22:54
If I like a question and I want to try and answer it later, this one's one that I feel pretty comfortable with. So, how to improve conversion rate of landing
2:23:01
page for a local service business. Please give us a real example results from and after. Perfect. I've actually
2:23:06
got some real world experience for that. So, I'm going to save this one and I'm going to show you where they get saved
2:23:11
later on. You'll see here um let's see one more.
2:23:21
There's another one that I might feel comfortable uh answering because it's about AI automation. So, I'm going to
2:23:26
save that as well. You can go through do this at least once a month. I think there's another one that was going to be
2:23:32
a little bit better for me.
2:23:41
No, looks like that's all the rest. So, now let's go and see if we can answer the ones that we selected. I'm going to
2:23:48
go to the filters and I'm just going to go to saved. They'll also tell you um if you've got the paid version of um
2:23:54
feature.com, it'll tell you the domain authority that they have. So you can check right away, but you can check with
2:24:00
any of the tools that are provided it even with the free tool of um uh ahrefs
2:24:06
for example. So here if I go marketingsherpa.com, I can just go to a free tool like ahrefs
2:24:14
free SEO tools just if I'm doing the search. I want to do the due diligence and let's go to
2:24:22
website authority checker. Now again, these tools shouldn't be used as an absolute source of truth. The authority
2:24:29
can be a lot higher here, but this one's great. So domain authority of 83. So
2:24:35
this one's a pretty good one. If I get a backlink and it's marketing sherper, so it's about marketing. If I get a backlink to this, it makes sense for me
2:24:41
to do so, right? Um, perfect. So, let's go back here um and see where I've got
2:24:46
it saved. Uh how to improve your conversion rate or landing page for local services.
2:24:53
Perfect. So, I can answer this question really well. So, one of our community members in AI ranking, will he actually
2:25:01
increase the um title tag and the meta description? And that already increased the click-through rate from the search
2:25:09
engine results page for the title tag. And then we added another tool called VWO, which is a AB testing tool. And you
2:25:15
just test the color of the CTA and you see which one works better. So if I
2:25:21
wanted to use Chat GPT for this, I can. But uh I'm just going to say
2:25:26
one of the main things that people forget about is increasing the click-through rates from the search engine results page to your actual page.
2:25:32
You can do this by in the meta description adding a nice call to action at the end. This all needs to be within
2:25:40
155 characters in length. And ideally, if it's separate from your competition, have a look at what the search engine uh
2:25:46
results page looks like for that search term. And if it's different, you will increase your click-through rate
2:25:52
incredibly. And it's okay if it sounds a little
2:25:58
human. I actually like that. And then the second note, number two, is you can add a free software like a Microsoft
2:26:04
Clarity and VWO. And what you want to concentrate on is testing one thing at a time. You want to just test the call to
2:26:12
action on the landing page. Does submit your free form or does callers now work better.
2:26:21
And that's the main thing that I'm going to try and do. And I'm going to submit. Now, when I've
2:26:27
submit that uh answer, it's not that I'm going to get that backlink right away. You see that it's in review, meaning the
2:26:34
publishers need to read it and if they like my answer, then they'll publish it and I'll get a backlink as a result. You
2:26:39
can see here that I've had four of my um answers published by pretty good websites, SEO, SMO company, backlinking
2:26:46
building, and all these other ones. So, it's great. I just put a reminder once a month to do this just like I've done. The key is within the answers, which I
2:26:54
didn't do really well now that I think about it, but never mind, is to try and add your own experience because that
2:26:59
will set you apart from everyone else trying to do this. So, great. Now you know how to get your own backlinks if
2:27:05
you don't want to pay for backlinks. Now, if you do have a little bit of a budget, which hopefully you're watching
2:27:11
this and you do, what I recommend is you either go with Get Me Links or the Hoff. My personal favorite is Get Me Links.
2:27:18
Full disclosure, I have worked with them quite a bit. I know the current CEO, this gentleman here, he goes by
2:27:23
Alejandro Mayans, and I'll actually leave his YouTube video below because he offers some incredible words of wisdom
2:27:30
when it comes to backlinking. I highly recommend you watch that. It's a channel that gets little views, but it's so much value. Anyway, what they do here is you
2:27:38
can get a free backlinking strategy call. It's completely risk-free. So, they'll show you, well, looking at your
2:27:44
website, what they recommend when it comes to backlinks. So, you don't even have to kind of go with them. But I highly recommend you even do the link
2:27:50
building strategy. They're going to drop some absolute wisdom for you.
2:27:59
Now, they've got a lot of different kind of packages in different industries. Uh you can get links, uh link insertions,
2:28:06
tier links, and they can explain all this to you. There's also different industries, some of them which are usually difficult to get a backlink
2:28:12
from. But remember in the beginning of this section about backlinking, I said you need it needs to be industry
2:28:18
related. They've got more industries than these, but at least you can see that they've segmented already in the
2:28:23
industries that they feel really comfortable with. If you look down, um, they've got some packages here.
2:28:30
You can always start with the slow burner. That'll get you a couple of links to get started with, but they'll give you the best kind of package that
2:28:37
they recommend. Once you create an account, log in and
2:28:44
submit your first link package, which I recommend you do after the meeting you have with them. By the way, you talk to a real person. It's not AI. Um, once you
2:28:52
completed, this is kind of what the orders will look like. They'll let you know uh
2:29:01
they'll let you know what the anchor text is, the target URL, meaning your URL that you wanted people to link to,
2:29:08
and they'll also give you the website that they linked from. So, it's really easy to understand. I would highly
2:29:14
recommend it. The thing here is that you don't see the return of investment of
2:29:19
backlinking for another three sometimes to six months. So, it can be a very difficult investment to make. It's very
2:29:25
different from something like uh PPC and things like that. But the reality is that I can kind of guarantee that any
2:29:33
agency that you've gotten to get your back links in the in the past, they have had or they've handed it off to an
2:29:40
agency like Get Me Links. For all disclosure as well, it's just because I work with these guys. The link in the
2:29:45
description for Get Me Links is an affiliate link. You don't pay any extra. I think you actually get a discount. And
2:29:50
if you do get it, I get paid. But I just want to be very very clear here. I don't want to hide anything. So that's the
2:29:56
main thing. And to finalize this, you can also go to the Hoth. Let's have a quick look here. Just so I'm offering
2:30:02
another one, and I'm not just offering the guys that I go with, so it doesn't seem too one-sided. They're also fantastic. I have worked with them in
2:30:09
the past. I'm not affiliated with them. Um I'm just more affiliated with Gam Links because I work with them more. I'm
2:30:14
a bit more comfortable with them. But these two you can go for. Again, they're not cheap, right? Um, but if you're in a
2:30:23
competitive niche and if you saw in the beginning when we did the competitor research and your competitor has, you
2:30:29
know, 10 times the back links you do, then it's going to be probably very
2:30:34
difficult for you to compete against them without a bit of a backlinking strategy. So, that's why it's good doing
2:30:39
that competitor analysis in the beginning. It'll give you an understanding of, well, they have more backlinks and coincidentally, a lot more
2:30:45
traffic and leads. Therefore, I probably need to concentrate with this. The reality is that the backlinks in for the
2:30:52
internet, I think we'll summarize it with this, is that back links are the trust signals
2:30:59
of the internet and they still really do matter. Because if you think about it, the more external websites are linking
2:31:05
to you for a specific keyword, it's the more that the search engines can say, well, okay, if a lot of reputable
2:31:11
websites are pointing to this site for a certain topic, then it must mean that because they link to them, they trust
2:31:18
them enough. And essentially, that's what it is. It's a really important trust metrics. The more people link to
2:31:23
you, aka the more people trust you, the more Google is willing or any other AI search engine is willing to rank you
2:31:30
higher. It's that simple. Before
2:31:37
we before we move on, I also want to show you quickly how to kind of spot a bad link or a red flag. For this, you
2:31:44
will need some sort of application like ahref semrush, something that will help you analyze or visualize this. Now,
2:31:51
ahrefs have a cheap plan. I think it's $29 a month. You can get that for a little bit. I'll leave a link for you
2:31:56
below. They kind of hide that cheaper plan, which they're very sneaky about. So you don't have to spend the $129 a
2:32:02
month I think it is which I believe it's too expensive. The main thing you want to look at that will should give you a
2:32:07
big red flag is when we go to the general. So for example, marketing Sherper, which is the link that I was
2:32:13
trying to get before, right? We want to look down and go to the performance metrics. Whichever tool you use, SEM
2:32:20
Rush, HS, Moz, whatever should have a graph that looks a little bit like this,
2:32:25
where I can see the referring domains, how many external websites are linking to them, and the organic traffic. And
2:32:31
really, the main thing that you want to look at is this one. You see how this referring domain is growing gradually
2:32:38
and naturally. That indicates as me as well that it's a
2:32:43
pretty good website. They've done this in a natural manner throughout a couple of years. Where you need to be cautious
2:32:50
is if if you're looking at a site you want to backlink from, but if the blue let me turn this to blue so it makes
2:32:56
sense. So the if the backlinking uh data instead of this blue up here, it just
2:33:03
all of a sudden goes bam and then like that and bam and then like that or just
2:33:08
one big massive uptick all of a sudden boom boom. Now it's not to say that this
2:33:15
isn't always unnatural. Sometimes maybe they published a really big article and they did go a little bit viral, but
Analytics
2:33:21
you'll need to find that link. But for the most part, if it's an extremely aggressive growth, then that's a big red
2:33:28
flag and you want to watch out for that. I thought it's kind of essential for me to mention that.
2:33:39
Okay, welcome. This is the sections on analytics. It's something that most people hate. I used to hated including
2:33:46
because I was a little bit allergic to numbers, but I wanted to just make sure you run through the basics. the things
2:33:52
that you should be looking at and others that you completely should ignore. And the one thing that I want you to get out
2:33:59
of this analytics section is essentially to please avoid analysis paralysis. Throughout my years of teaching SEO and
2:34:06
showing my clients all this sort of stuff, that's the one thing that I see an issue with when it comes to data. And
2:34:12
when yourself, meaning a human here, is looking at the data. More data doesn't
2:34:17
necessarily mean better decisions. how it does when you give it to an AI, which I'll show you how to do, but you really
2:34:23
want to only track the numbers that you'll actually act on. And I've learned this myself. Alex Hamozi also says this,
2:34:28
and I really, really agree with it. You want to ignore vanity numbers. And I'm
2:34:33
going to show you a metric that I think is people get way too focused on that is a complete vanity metric. Meaning, it
2:34:40
looks good, but it means next to nothing really. So before we get to the data
2:34:46
that you should look at, I really want you to avoid this one data set that kind of gets me annoyed sometimes.
2:34:54
And that data set can be called different things, but essentially it's looking at the same kind of thing. And that is domain ranking. You can also
2:35:02
hear it as domain authority, website authority, a lot of these different things. And I want to be very clear here
2:35:08
that that data set was created by Moz. Moz is another SEO tool. So MozH and SEM
2:35:16
Rush even data for SEO, they all have their own versions and they all calculate differently this domain
2:35:23
authority or website authority. And you see websites with a really high domain authority that don't necessarily get
2:35:30
conversions. So please do not focus on domain authority. It's not a completely
2:35:36
useless number, but it's a vanity metric. I recommend looking at things at how many keywords you're actually
2:35:42
ranking for and eventually your actual conversions. At the end of the day, that's the aim of the game here. It's
2:35:47
not just looking pretty on numbers, but what does the bottom line say? And
2:35:52
domain authority or domain ranking doesn't correlate one to one to your bottom line. So, with that being said,
2:36:03
let's look at the two data sets that I believe really are the ones you should be looking at. that is Google search
2:36:08
console and Google Analytics. I want to make sure that we all understand the differences between those because I find
2:36:14
that a lot of people get confused with this. Google search console is what your
2:36:20
website ranks for in the Google search engine. This is the average position of your pages, your click-through rates
2:36:26
from the search engine results page to the actual website. It also it's great at telling you the issues that you might
2:36:33
have. In short, it's really how Google sees my website. Whereas Google
2:36:38
Analytics is what your visitors do on your website and it tells you where all
2:36:44
the traffic is coming from to your website, not just Google. Also tells you what they are doing once they land on
2:36:51
the page. In short here, it's what do the users do when they arrive on the website. So therefore, I think these
2:36:58
really are the two data sets that are really important. A lot of SEO agencies, me included by the way, used to be
2:37:05
really kind of proud when I would increase a ranking and I will tell the client, oh, I increase your keyword
2:37:11
ranking from 30 to 10. Great, but that
2:37:16
doesn't really attribute to kind of results and bottom line. Not that it's useless, but sometimes we focus on the
2:37:23
wrong kind of metrics. So, let's take a look quick look at Google Search Console. And I think there's a couple of
2:37:30
things you really should be looking at. I'm not going to this isn't going to be
2:37:35
a tutorial on how to get your Google Search Console account. That's relatively easy to do. I'm going to
2:37:40
assume you have your Google Search Console. It's fairly easy to to kind of install. So, you can do a research on
2:37:46
that. But essentially, when you get to your Google Search Console account, you're going to get an overall performance, how many pages are being
2:37:53
indexed, yada yada. Um, and they've added some new tabs tabs, which is the
2:37:58
insights tab, which gives you an overall view of over the past 28 days, how many clicks you've gotten, the total number
2:38:04
of impressions, what's trending up. Really interesting to note, by the way, this page here, this is a client that we
2:38:10
used to work for long time ago, and we built this um this blog post for them.
2:38:16
And this blog post is 100% AI generated, and it's generating them a lot of
2:38:22
traffic and a lot of revenue. So, I just want to make sure to kind of give you some proof here that the AI content that
2:38:28
I showed you how to do really, really does work. Anyway, you can also see the queries to your site. Now, I think the
2:38:35
queries here is probably the most important thing. And there's two main
2:38:41
keywords that you want. I guess three main keywords. Apologies. You really want to make sure that your top queries
2:38:48
really should always be your brand name. Once you kind of get things going in the beginning, that might not be the case.
2:38:55
But if you're not ranking at all for your brand name, then there's an issue. And there's also the possibility that
2:39:01
someone can outrank you for your own brand name. So this business is called BPC Tech, Budget PC Technology, I think,
2:39:08
and they're ranking for their keyword. Fantastic. I'm happy with that. Good. I can also see the average position for
2:39:15
those keywords. So they're number one for BBC Tech. Great. They're doing the right keyword. The rest are all um
2:39:22
product categories that they're ranking pretty well for. And it even tells you the position. Now, unfortunately, even
2:39:28
this isn't an exact science because if I search for if I'm in Australia and I search for the product RTX uh 4090, I
2:39:36
think that's computer thing, I probably won't see this exact page in or the
2:39:43
exact link in page two. So, sometimes it's a little bit difficult to use that data. So, there's a couple of things
2:39:50
that we need to look at here. Like I said, um three main keywords, sorry. Your brand keyword, any type of product
2:39:55
or service keyword as well asformational keywords. If you're writing blog post,
2:40:03
for example, if I take a look at my website, uh this is aformational keyword
2:40:08
claude 3.5 Sonic prompt engineering. I've done a blog post about how to the best way to prompt engineer uh claude
2:40:15
3.5. That's an old blog as well. But going back to the one that we have
2:40:21
been looking at. Um there's a couple of things also that you want to see here and that is essentially when it goes to
2:40:29
the pages here. Sometimes this will tell you why your pages aren't being indexed.
2:40:34
And I'm not going to go through every single one here, but if for some reason you're not getting a lot of traffic, it
2:40:40
might be that your pages aren't being indexed. And a quick note here, just because Google crawls your site or your
2:40:47
page does not necessarily mean that it's going to index it. And that is a whole different story on well, how do I
2:40:53
troubleshoot that? How do I make sure that that is being indexed? But that might give you the starting point of
2:40:59
what's going on here? Why does not Google not like my page? Now, within Google Analytics, how do I turn this
2:41:06
data into actionable insights? What I can go do is go to search results.
2:41:12
And this is going to have a lot of data. So I just want to actually go to the past 28 days.
2:41:19
And yeah, it's got a lot of data here. And I can download this report. I can
2:41:24
export as a CSV file, as a Google sheet, whatever I want. I'm going to download the CSV file of this. It should come as
2:41:31
a compressed folder. I can open the files. And if I open that, it's going to
2:41:36
have all these data sets. They're just CSV files of the data. Let me show you how one looks like here. It's just the
2:41:44
date and all that sort of stuff. So, it's very difficult for me included even
2:41:50
to turn data into actionable insights, but thankfully we've got AI to do that. I think that's the good blend with AI
2:41:56
and um and SEO. This is a Google Search Console data expert. And what you want
2:42:02
to do is the data that we just downloaded,
2:42:07
we're going to give to this custom GPT. We're going to wait for it to load. And
2:42:13
this is the wonderful thing about having smart language models. We can let it do
2:42:18
all the things we don't want to do ourselves, which is try and figure out what to do with these things. And it's taking its thinking a lot, which it
2:42:25
should do, and give us some actionable insight. So, if you're lost to what to do with your website and how to improve
2:42:31
it, this is a great start because it can kind of give you actionable insights. You don't go blind. You're making
2:42:37
datadriven decisions. Right? Whilst this is loading and giving us our insight, I
2:42:42
want to look at one more thing that I recommend you look at. If you are ever lost and you don't really know on what
2:42:50
you should be doing next month or your website or your client's website, one
2:42:55
easy thing to do is to look at the pages and I want you to go to average position
2:43:02
and then uh let's filter this by the uh top position
2:43:08
hopefully. Perfect. Great. And what you want to do is make sure that actually
2:43:14
let's go back. Perfect. Let's go to more rows. Go to 50. And one of the easiest
2:43:20
things to do to that I think are the lowhanging fruit is any page here that
2:43:26
you see in the position is between 9 to 10. It means that it's technically
2:43:32
around the second page of the Google search engine results. And I think
2:43:38
that's lowhanging fruit because it's already ranking. It's just not ranking really well. So, we can go and inspect
2:43:44
that page and see how we can amend it or how we can rank it higher. We might get some back links directly to that page.
2:43:52
We might write supporting content like I just showed you before that links to that page. We might do a few other
2:43:58
strategies. And the reason why that's easier because you're starting from something that is already indexed. It's
2:44:04
already getting some traffic. You just need to improve that. So, I think it's kind of a lowhanging fruit to start
2:44:11
doing if you don't know where to go. Let's go back to our GPT and see what it's told us here.
2:44:17
Perfect. So, lowhanging fruit and and I promise I didn't I forgot that this GPT
2:44:24
did this, but it's telling us low hanging fruit right away. So, positions 11 to 30 opportunities iPad mini RTX50.
2:44:31
What to do? Um, now I'm not after your coffee. Uh, and
2:44:37
it's telling you how to optimize this stuff, what exactly you should be doing, how to increase the click-through rates,
2:44:43
the featured snippets, and hidden gems as well. So, you actually have some
2:44:49
actionable insights on what to do with this data, right? I think it's a really
2:44:54
handy thing to do. You can set yourself a reminder every month to kind of go through this data. It's also going to
2:45:00
give you some insights into if your website is seasonal. For example, for
2:45:06
BPC Tech, we understood that every time that um Invidia released a new product
2:45:12
because they sell computer stuff, their search went up. So, you can build strategies around that. But anyway, I
2:45:19
digress. But your business might be seasonal as well. If you do um landscaping in winter, you're probably
2:45:25
not going to get that much business as well. And this will tell you that story. and then you can make datadriven
2:45:31
decisions. The other thing that you should obviously look at is Google Analytics. Now, I could do probably a
2:45:37
whole three-hour tutorial on Google Analytics itself, but I think it's really interesting for me anyway,
2:45:43
finding out where the majority of the traffic is coming from. And this allowed you to make good decisions because you
2:45:49
don't only see which where the traffic is coming to your website, but which
2:45:54
traffic is higher quality, right? Just because you get a lot of traffic from Tik Tok, let's say, might not mean that
2:46:01
all that traffic from Tik Tok is converting. You might get less traffic from uh let's say Instagram, but you
2:46:07
find that you get more conversions. Let's find that out really quickly. So, you can go to the reports, you can go to
2:46:14
the business objectives, and we're going to go to uh traffic acquisition,
2:46:20
and this is going to tell you where all your traffic is coming from. So we've got here direct and organic search.
2:46:26
Organic search is Google referral other websites linking to you organic shopping
2:46:32
unassigned which is just doesn't have any enough tracking to tell you paid social. So if you're running ads organic
2:46:39
social paid search and you can sement segment this a little bit further even.
2:46:45
So let's go for example to uh source and medium and this will tell you even a
2:46:51
little bit more data. This is over the past 28 days. So perfect. So one of the referral
2:46:56
websites, this is why we look at data, right? One of the referral websites that are getting them a lot of traffic is a
2:47:05
particer.com. So let's have a look at that website, right? Just to see, well, why they bring
2:47:10
them a lot of traffic and the traffic is generally really good quality. There's a lot of events. They stay around for a
2:47:17
relatively long time. 45 seconds on average is not too bad. So let's take a
2:47:22
look, right? What is this website all about? So, it's in Australia. We know it makes
2:47:28
sense. It's PC part picker. It also makes sense. So, then I can probably go, okay, perfect. They help people pick
2:47:36
their parts for their gaming PCs. Now, if I wanted to come up with
2:47:41
recommendations for these guys or for if they were my client again or if I was
2:47:46
working for them, I would reach out to PC Piger and say, "Hey, how can we work with you guys? getting us a lot of
2:47:51
traffic that tends to convert. It might be a really lowhanging fruit for us to follow. So that's why we look at data.
2:47:59
Now depending on what data you have, it'll be really different on how you analyze it, but I just want to give you
2:48:04
a quick understanding of that. The other thing that I think is important for you
2:48:09
to look at is um let me see if I can find it really quickly and that is the
2:48:18
tech in which users are going on your website. If I go to overview and tech I believe you'll find the main subdivision
2:48:25
on the devices that people are using to go to your website. And I think maybe once a quarter this is
2:48:32
good for you to do because it sometimes shows you what might be going wrong. For
2:48:40
example, they've got 78% desktop. So most of the traffic comes on desktop which makes sense. People on PC are
2:48:47
looking for PC stuff. Then you have mobile and tablet. What might happen sometimes is that you are getting for
2:48:55
some reason no conversions through desktop and more conversions through mobile. That'll indicate uh I'll
2:49:01
probably need to look at the mobile. There might be something wrong here. You can see the most people coming in Chrome. You might use that in your
2:49:08
marketing. I'm not quite sure how, but you get the idea. I just want to make sure that like that's why we look at the
2:49:13
data. But again, you can see that I'm already getting a bit of analysis paralysis that there's so much data.
2:49:19
What do I do with this that I sometimes I I think that if you're not going to use it, just do not worry about it.
2:49:27
But there's one thing that I do want to make sure we do. Okay, perfect. I've got the device category within Google
2:49:33
Analytics. So, I'm all the way at the bottom. I'm at the tech and I'm at the tech details. I think the one piece of
2:49:39
data that really makes sense for you to look at is the difference between the desktop and the mobile and the
2:49:45
conversion rate. So I can see here for example that the uh
2:49:54
the engagement rate is a little bit higher on mobile and the average user
2:49:59
per engagement rate. So the traffic seems to be a little bit more healthy from mobile. My only reasoning or what I
2:50:07
would do with that would be that okay I probably need to make sure that the conversion rate of the mobile is really
2:50:12
really good. then I can go on the website from a mobile perspective and see where I can make some improvements. That's how I would go and use the data.
2:50:20
And that's where I want to leave it. I don't want to complicate things too much. You can always find really good
2:50:28
dashboards for Google Search Console and free ones um without kind of wasting too
2:50:35
much money on this. So, the free tool that I would recommend you use is Google
2:50:42
Lucer Studio if you want a pretty template and you don't want to spend too much money on it. This is one that I've built from our premium community. Um,
2:50:49
but it kind of looks like this. And in our premium community, people can have it, but it's just an overall perspective of Google Analytics and Google Search
2:50:56
Console in the one bird's eye perspective. Easy to see. I can see all
2:51:01
the keywords that I'm ranking for, the landing pages, where people are coming from. So, you can either look for or
2:51:08
Google GPT search free Google look to uh studio template or you can hire someone
2:51:13
on Fiverr to make one for you. I can't give you these this one unfortunately. It's for the premium community, but you
2:51:19
don't need it. Sometimes all that you need is just to understand Google search console and Google Analytics. And if you
2:51:25
throw all that useful data into something like chat GBT 5 with this
2:51:31
custom GBT, this GBD I will leave you in the detail belows, you can still make good data driven decisions without a
2:51:37
pretty report. And that's it. We're not going to complicate analytics anymore.
AI Automations
2:51:46
Okay, let's finish on a high note and on a very helpful and interesting note and that is AI automations. Before we get
2:51:52
cracking with this, just a bit of a word of warning. Just because everything can be automated doesn't mean that
2:51:58
everything should be automated. What I mean here is that sometimes I've seen absolute horror cases of people wanting
2:52:04
to scale and automate everything and it just goes completely wrong because they don't get the fundamentals right of SEO.
2:52:11
Just make sure you understand that before we move on. That being said, to automate, you're going to need automation software. And these are the
2:52:17
main three ones that I've tried personally and I've had really good experience with. Pabi is definitely out
2:52:23
of the three the easiest one to just plug and play and get started automating really cool things without any need of
2:52:30
coding whatsoever. Make the second one down is probably the
2:52:35
one of the most well-known ones. At least it was. Uh but it adds a little bit more of complexity but it's a lot
2:52:41
more flexible than Pabi. It integrates with practically everything under the sun and it's a nice and easy to use
2:52:47
click and drag software. It's the one that I predominantly use. Now, N8N is
2:52:53
getting really popular these day. This is open- source and you can self-host it, meaning you can save hundreds and
2:52:59
hundreds on subscription cost. It's great if you're a little bit more comfortable with coding, although it's
2:53:04
not even that difficult. But if you want to offer automation services and scale that, then I would definitely recommend
2:53:11
N8. There are literally hundreds and thousands of tutorials on how to get that set up. So, take your pick. But for
2:53:17
this exact automation, we're going to use the easiest one. I want to give you the lowest friction to start this off.
2:53:23
We're going to do a local SEO automation. And we're going to do this using some of the data that we've learned from the local SEO section. So,
2:53:30
what we're going to do is three main things. We're going to automate that for every time you upload an Instagram image
2:53:36
to your Instagram account, that image is going to that we're going to get that image and we're going to take it to a
2:53:41
Google business profile. Now you don't have to worry about uploading up to 100 images on Google business profile. We
2:53:49
mentioned previously in the local SEO section that this is really good and it's going to increase your overall calls, clicks, and conversions. The next
2:53:56
thing we're going to automate is turning your blog posts into Google business posts. You can't just copy and paste
2:54:02
them over because Google business posts, they kind of need to be rewritten. You don't want to copy content and there's
2:54:07
also a lot less characters that you can do uh with a Google business post. And then finally, we're going to automate uh
2:54:13
the responding to reviews. But I want to be very clear here that I tend to be very safe here and I only reply to
2:54:21
positive reviews with AI. The negative reviews, they need a bit of a human touch. And you don't want any errors,
2:54:26
any room for error. So I recommend you don't do this with negative reviews. With that being said, we also need one
2:54:33
more tool here, and that is an AI tool or really an API key. For this instance, we're going to use Open Router. This
2:54:41
might sound a little bit scary, but trust me, it's very easy to use and you're going to thank for me, thank me later for it because this one API key
2:54:49
will allow you to access every single large language model under the sun. You can choose the cheaper models and some
2:54:56
open- source models, some absolute free models. This is great because you only need one API key to test everything
2:55:02
instead of having three different API keys if you want to try three different models. And these three automations are
2:55:09
something that I install all the time. I used to sell this as a service and I just find the ones that really actually
2:55:14
make a difference. So let's get started by creating an account with open router first.
2:55:21
So using the link in the resources, I want you to go to open router. You can see it already has all the models that
2:55:27
you can test here. I'm going to sign in. You need to create an account obviously. Now once you're logged in, you can test
2:55:33
it out and I think it's quite fun to do so. So for example, I can chat here and I can select the flagship models to see
2:55:41
which one gives me the best response. So I can try it right away. I can use Gemini Pro, Claude Sonic, Gro 4, and
2:55:48
GPT5 to answer the classic strawberry test, for example. And if I do that, it's
2:55:54
sending that question or that request to all four models right away. And then I can really determine what is best for
2:56:01
me. Now, they all seem to know how to answer that question at least. Let's see if one of them gets it wrong. Sonnet is
2:56:07
right. Grock is right. GBD5 is right. That's good. They all know how to do that. So, we want to go to your credit
2:56:15
section here, and you're going to need to add some credits. $5 is more than enough here, and $5 is going to go a
2:56:22
very, very long way, particularly with the cheap models that we're going to be using thanks to Open Router. So, you
2:56:28
want to top it up with $5 at the most. Uh you can do the auto top up, but to
2:56:34
add the credits, you're going to see zero here. Uh you're just going to buy credits. You can use your uh bank
2:56:39
account or your credit card. That's pretty self-explan explanatory. I'm going to let you do that. So once you
2:56:46
have that, the other thing that you need is keys. And you want to create your own API key. You're going to have none here.
2:56:53
What you're going to go to is create an API key. Let's call it family automation. so you can keep track of
2:57:01
where it's spending the credits. And I'm going to go to create. Now, you really want to save this key here. That is the
2:57:08
only time that you're going to be able to see it. So, copy it and save it somewhere that you can access it later.
2:57:15
I'm going to delete that API key so you guys can't use it. I know you wouldn't anyway, but just for a security
2:57:21
purposes. Great. So, now the next thing to do is to create an account with Pabi. Uh the
2:57:29
free version is more than enough for what we're trying to do. If you really want to scale this, you might have to get the paid version. So once you uh
2:57:36
sign in or you create an account, it'll look a little bit like this. And we want to go to Pab Connect. We're going to
2:57:42
access that now. So it goes without saying that you need access to the Instagram account
2:57:48
obviously and you need to be admin to the Google business account. So it'll
2:57:53
look a little bit like this. You can add the post and everything like that. That is kind of a non-negotiable. we really need that stuff. Okay, so for the first
2:58:01
one, I recommend that you create a folder and you name it the client that we're doing this for. Uh, so I'm just
2:58:07
going to go tutorial example. That way, we can keep everything nice
2:58:12
and organized and it doesn't just create an absolute mess further down the line.
2:58:18
Uh, great. Now, we're going to create a workflow.
2:58:23
Oh, it's good. I've got a new better thing. I'm just going to go the classic because I've done this a couple of times. So, you want to name it something
2:58:29
that you're not going to forget. So, we're going to go Instagram Instagram
2:58:35
uh to Google business. If I could spell business, it
2:58:41
would be fantastic. Uh tutorial example is the folder. Great. So, we're already keeping nice everything nice and
2:58:47
organized. Perfect. So now we want to choose a
2:58:54
trigger, right? The starting point for the automation, we want to choose the app in the choose app feature. I'm going
2:59:00
to go to Instagram and you will need to be on Instagram for business, right? And
2:59:07
perfect. I'm going to choose the trigger event. That means when this automation starts and I'm just going to go new
2:59:13
media updated to the account. I need to connect this.
2:59:19
you will have to create your connection for the first time. So, let's do that now. I'm going to name this here again.
2:59:25
Tutorial uh example and connect with Instagram for business. You'll have this pop up
2:59:32
here. Nothing out of the ordinary. And that's why I like this. It's just very kind of easy. So, now that I'm
2:59:39
connected, I need to select the account here. I've got a couple. I'm just going to use mine. Uh it'll be a bit weird
2:59:46
because I'm using my Instagram account for another business, but you get the idea. Obviously, pick the Instagram business account to the Google business
2:59:52
account that correlates. Uh I'm going to go save and test. Perfect. So, you can
2:59:59
see in the test that it's done, it's getting me all the information that we can pull through. We can pull the media
3:00:05
URL link and get that later on and a bunch of different things. That is a video. Uh okay, perfect. So now the next
3:00:13
action is quite easy, right? We want to go to your Google business profile.
3:00:21
Google business profile. We want to add an action. And here we
3:00:28
want to upload media or photo. For this instance, I'm going to do a video
3:00:34
because I know the latest one has been a video there. You can choose either one. It's fine. And I obviously need to
3:00:40
connect that account. Let's go through this again. I'm going to add a new connection. Um, and I'm going to go
3:00:45
tutorial example. You need to sign in with Google. Great.
3:00:52
And that's why I kind of like Pably. Just makes things nice and easy. So now I need to the choose the account. I'm
3:00:58
going to go to my inclusion, which is the one that we're trying out for. Um, source data. So here we're going to
3:01:06
enter the publicly accessible URL where the media can be retrieved from. So we
3:01:12
know that when we tested it, we actually got a bit of media and we need the media URL that one. So here what we need to do
3:01:22
is select the source media URL. And we do that by going in here and
3:01:28
selecting all the attributes that were pulled through through the Instagram post. And here is the media URL. And
3:01:36
that is it. You can choose a category. Uh let's just go at work. Perfect. So
3:01:42
now let's go and look at the my inclusion stuff. So the Google business
3:01:48
account, you can see that it's got no photos.
3:01:53
Let's look at the photos and videos for that account. It's very non-existent. Not even a client of mine, just a friend
3:01:59
I asked to to use their account. but they've got no images whatsoever, which is perfect for this. So, let's go to
3:02:08
Pabi and we're going to send and test and see if everything works.
3:02:15
And we should have gotten everything done. So,
3:02:23
let's refresh this. And you can see that now it's uploading
3:02:29
that video. That was the last video in my Instagram account. But perfect, it's being uploaded. So, you can upload in uh
3:02:35
images and videos. We'll give that a second and then I can show you that. But that's done. That's it. It's that easy.
3:02:40
You can leave that on autopilot. I highly recommend this automation. The last thing we want to do is save it.
3:02:48
And if you're happy with this whole thing, you want to make sure that it's on. So, your workflow is on. It's going to trigger every time you upload a video
3:02:55
or an image into your Instagram account. It will go to your Google business profile. Nice and easy. That's it.
3:03:02
So, this one is all done. Okay. Now, time for the second automation where we're going to grab your blog post when
3:03:08
it's published, rewrite that, and turn that into a Google business post. I really like this one. It's quite easy.
3:03:14
We're going to go to create a workflow. We're going to select the classic builder, and we're going to name it correctly. So, uh blog to Google
3:03:22
business profile post, and we're going to put it in the right folder. We're going to create.
3:03:28
Now, this one gets a little bit more technical, but not that much. What we want to start off with is an RSS feed.
3:03:35
Thankfully, Pab give us a free one. And we're going to select new item in feed.
3:03:41
We're going to connect. Uh, perfect. So, all you need to do for most WordPress websites, your feed is
3:03:49
automatically built in. And the feed is your website/the feed. That is it. If
3:03:55
you're working with something else, you're going to have to Google or GPT search where to get the feed from your
3:04:00
website. There's other ways to build it as well, but I'm going to keep things nice and simple. Uh, going back to
3:04:07
automation builder, I'm going to say here feed URL. Perfect. And I'm going to
3:04:13
save and test. This is going to call that feed. Essentially, Pably now or the RSS feed is asking, hey, what was your
3:04:19
most recent published post? Give me that information, please. And we can see here the most recent published post was a URL
3:04:26
that says uh my inclusion uh the benefits of therapeutic gardening. Perfect. So I've got a few other things
3:04:33
there as well. I even have I think the
3:04:38
image for this I think. Perfect. So I've got everything that I need. The next
3:04:44
action that I want to do is you could get a scraper to scrape the contents of
3:04:49
that blog post. But thankfully, I think this is an easier way around this. We're
3:04:54
actually going to use Open Router to not only crawl this, but actually also rewrite this. So, here we're going to
3:05:00
type in open router. And you can see that's got that selection there.
3:05:06
We need to um make sure you've
3:05:16
action event. We're going to create a chat completion. We need to connect this. I'm going to add a new connection
3:05:23
so I can show you here. Open router
3:05:28
tutorial. And the token is the API key that we got before that we created. I
3:05:34
hope you saved that one. If not, you can create another API. Great. Chuck that token or the API key there. We're going
3:05:39
to save that. It's going to validate it. Make sure you've got some credits and this thing is actually going to work.
3:05:45
You'll need to place in a site map or any kind of website in there for some reason. I'm not 100% sure why to be
3:05:50
honest, but it's got to work with one of these things. Now, the models, this is very, very important. You need a model
3:05:57
that has native access to the internet. GPT has one, but as well, my favorite is
3:06:02
really perplexity. Perplexity is an AI powered search engine. uh you don't need something too difficult but sonar for
3:06:10
example I know has native access to the internet so it's nice and easy the role is going to be user we don't need to go
3:06:18
into the system roll for this we're not doing rocket science it's a fairly simple prompt now this is where you're
3:06:25
going to grab one of the components that I've got ready for you and this is a
3:06:30
prompt right we're going to copy this entire prompt we're going to go back to a uh we're going to to Pabi, sorry. And
3:06:38
we're going to paste that in there. You can see that we need to format it a tiny bit. And essentially what we're doing
3:06:44
here is we are getting the um perplexity
3:06:49
sonar model to go to the URL, read the whole thing, understand it, and rewrite it in the same tone of voice as the blog
3:06:56
post, but just in less than 1,500 characters so that it fits into Google
3:07:02
Business. And there's no I even say actually 100,450. So there's a little bit of leeway there.
3:07:08
Let me just format this a tiny bit better. So now I can see where I need to
3:07:13
put the URLs in here. So here for example, I need to uh
3:07:20
select the blog URL section. I need to delete that and I need to go to the RSS feed and I need to give it the U. The
3:07:28
rest you can see if you want. I'm actually going to delete these other ones. Depending on the complexity of the blog post, you might have to do that as
3:07:34
well. Uh, perfect. So, now we have told it what to do, where the information is.
3:07:41
Let's see if we get everything working. We're going to save and test. So, ideally, it's going to read the blog
3:07:46
post about the benefits of therapeutic gardening and rewrite it for us as well.
3:07:52
Now, there's a key a few key components here. Um, you can have a call to action within that prompt to say read more
3:07:58
here, whatever you want. But I'm just going to keep it nice and easy. But I'm getting the the post ready for it. I'm
3:08:06
just going to fix that a little bit. I'll make sure I give you the fix one. It's just giving the URL here at the bottom, and I don't really want that.
3:08:12
I'm going to save this and test it. That's a little bit better. Couple hashtags, whatever. I don't mind that.
3:08:18
If you don't want them, you just say in the prompt that you don't want any hashtags, but for me, that's it's fine. So, I'm going to save that. And now we
3:08:26
need to get that content and upload it to the Google business profile as a post. We're going to add one more step.
3:08:33
We're going to choose Google Google, sorry, Google
3:08:38
uh what's on your mind, Nikico. Uh Google business profile.
3:08:46
Uh the action event is going to create add an action post. There's a lot of
3:08:52
other things here. Uh but for now, the action post is going to be enough. It's an action post only because it's a
3:08:59
normal post and you have a CTA at the end where we'll leave a link to the blog post. Perfect. We're going to connect
3:09:06
here. Uh we've got it connection already. I'm going to save this.
3:09:13
And the location name, we need to select the right account here. conclusion the
3:09:18
summary meaning the content we give what was the output of open router so that is
3:09:25
the message content perfect the action type we want to always say learn more
3:09:31
and the URL that'll be connected to that call to action button needs to be the URL of the blog post so if somebody
3:09:37
wants to read more they can go to the blog post that's another little tricky way to get a little bit more traffic to those blog posts depending on the RSS
3:09:44
feed you might be able to extract the image image from that as well, but we don't have it at the moment, and it's no
3:09:50
biggie. So, what I want to test now is making sure that I see this at the
3:09:56
moment. Uh, let's see how the Did the video get uploaded? It's still pending. That's fine. So, at the moment, um,
3:10:02
there is there are no last posts. There's no updates, and that's where they would usually go, right? I think I
3:10:09
go to posts here. There might be one. Yeah, the benefits of therapeutic gardening, but that was last year. So, I want to do the same one here. So, let's
3:10:16
test this. Save and send request.
3:10:24
And it looks like it's processing. Everything seems to be okay.
3:10:29
Let's go back to the Google business profile. I'm going to refresh this.
3:10:35
And there you go. 11 seconds ago. There is my post, right? And if I go to learn more, I go to the post of that URL.
3:10:44
Perfect. So done, right? That's pretty good. Now you can leave that on autopilot and you don't have to worry
3:10:50
about that anymore. Again, we're going to save this and we're going to make sure that it's on and we can go to our
3:10:57
final workflow. So really good. You can update here a lot of things. If you
3:11:03
prefer not your blog post, but your YouTube videos or your Instagram posts, whatever it is, whatever the the source
3:11:09
of that content you want to be, you can use that. Now let's build the final one which is
3:11:17
responding to positive reviews. I'm going to create that last workflow. I'm going to select that again. This is go
3:11:25
review responder. I'm going to create it in the same
3:11:30
folder and then I'm going to create.
3:11:35
You can see how simple this tool tends to be. So now the trigger is when we receive a review. So, I'm going to go
3:11:42
again to Google business profile. It should allow me to select the trigger
3:11:48
new review. Going to connect. We've got the connection already. The tutorial
3:11:54
example. I'm going to choose the right location.
3:12:01
Perfect. I'm going to save and test. So, let's save and test this to see if we're actually getting the reviews. Perfect.
3:12:07
So, they've got one review. So, it's nice and easy. I've actually done it for this instance. And perfect. We've got my inclusion are extremely thoughtful
3:12:13
professional that helped me out with a problem that I had. Fantastic. So, I got a positive review. Great. The next
3:12:20
action is we're going to filter whether the reviews got more than three stars, right? We're going to uh connect this
3:12:28
again. We've got the connection done. So, we need to select the label and here
3:12:35
the star rating. So, if the star rating is
3:12:41
Perfect. So now the star ready is five. It's greater than four. It's a success. We can keep going.
3:12:47
And now what we want to do is create a response with a model using open router.
3:12:53
The same model that we used to rewrite our blog post to a Google business post.
3:12:58
So we're going to grab this and go to open router here. And now we can really select any
3:13:06
model that we want for this. Now, for this, you don't need a specifically incredibly smart model.
3:13:13
It's quite all right. Remember to fill out these things here. Uh the model, I think GPT 5 Nano or mini, all the fives
3:13:22
are more than enough for this. I'm just going to go mini. You can use a free one, but remember there will be
3:13:28
limitations for that. If you need to answer a lot of reviews, then you're going to hit a wall. So, I just want to choose a very cheap one. GT5 Mini is
3:13:35
very, very cheap. the user uh the role sorry is user the
3:13:42
context. Now you're going to have in the resources below uh a expert Google
3:13:48
business review responder template. What you want to do is make a copy of it and
3:13:53
you need to fill it out. So we're going to make a copy and we want to paste in all the things that you need. So review
3:13:59
responder for uh my inclusion a business type. So,
3:14:08
a local business that helps people navigate NDIS when it comes to hoarding
3:14:13
and squalor services as well as therapeutic gardening. And now here the the rest we can fill out. Beautiful.
3:14:21
We've actually already improved this and said that if it's a negative review respond, I've done this for you
3:14:26
actually. If it's below three, uh we're going to thank the reviewer for the feedback. We're going to apologize and then we're going to uh state one
3:14:32
proactive step. So contact us at this number please so we can fix the review. And actually now that I remember I do
3:14:39
this quite a lot. So I'm going to leave it there. Um contact email.
3:14:45
I'm going to go info at my inclusion.
3:14:54
And the phone number I'm just going to these are all fake by the way. Uh just create a random phone number. Perfect.
3:15:00
So now what I need to do is
3:15:05
copy this prompt. I'm going to go back to review responder
3:15:11
the context. I'm going to paste that in there. And I'm going to paste the review text. Let me format this a little bit
3:15:17
better. Great. Now I just need to fill out the couple of things. So when I go to review text, I need to delete that.
3:15:24
And I need to get the review text from Google business review. Here
3:15:31
it is, the comment. Perfect. The star rating. Now I don't even have to worry about the
3:15:36
filtering. I can just do the star rating here and go five. And I believe that is
3:15:42
everything I need to do. Respond to email. Yeah, I filled everything out.
3:15:47
Perfect. So you can even uh delete this and not have to worry about it. But now you know how to filter. So I'm actually
3:15:53
going to leave this in the tutorial. Okay. So now we're creating the response
3:16:00
to that review. We're not uploading it yet. You can do more sequences here. You
3:16:06
can get the uh response to go to a Google sheet first so you can read it
3:16:11
and make sure you're happy with it before. Be very careful here. This is one of these things you don't want to get wrong. Uh let's see the response
3:16:18
here. Uh thank you for your kind review. We're glad we're helpy situation. Best regard to Alice. Perfect. Alice is the
3:16:24
fake person name that I put in there. Uh great. So now
3:16:31
what we're going to do here is the next step which is uploading that
3:16:38
into Google business profile as a response. So we're going to go to Google
3:16:44
business profile. We're going to set an action. We're going to create a reply.
3:16:51
That's the bottom one. We don't want to use the legacy one. We're going to connect
3:16:56
Save account ID. We want to choose the right
3:17:02
account illusion. And it'll automatically pick the latest
3:17:09
review, which is what you want. And then your reply there. We need to pick the mapping from the response that open
3:17:16
router has given us. Fantastic. Great. So, let's check this out. Let's go to my
3:17:22
inclusion. Let's go to the reviews here. And we see that it's the review
3:17:27
hopefully that I've done. Perfect. From myself, I can see the whole review. That was 9 minutes ago. So, I just did it now for this instance. Great. Let's go to
3:17:35
the Pabi. Let's send and test. Going to give it a minute. Everything looks
3:17:42
pretty good. Let's go back to the Google business profile. Let's refresh this bad
3:17:47
boy. And there you go. We've already got the response. Perfect.
3:17:54
Right. So, the way that you respond to the reviews, just be cautious with those. Go through the prompt that I
3:18:00
provided. If you need to change it, please do. Um, but yeah, now we we're
3:18:05
kind of automating that. So, you don't really have to worry about that. So, we went through the automations of
3:18:12
uploading an Instagram image when you upload to Instagram automatically to Google business profile. We know that's
3:18:18
really good for interaction and getting more leads. The same thing with automating a blog post to a Google
3:18:23
business post with a call to action. And then we are responding to reviews, both negative and positive. Now, as a plus,
3:18:29
I'll leave that in there. That's quite all right. Well done for getting all this way. I can promise that if you follow all the things that I teach you,

Houston, Google shows a map with three business  listings at the top. Those are not websites. Those  
0:55
are Google business profiles. And here's what  matters. 60 to 70% of clicks go to those top  
1:01
three map positions. So if you're ranked fourth,  you're on page two. You're invisible. No one is  
1:06
scrolling down to find you. My favorite joke in  SEO, where's the best place to hide a dead body?   Page two of Google's search. This is why local  SEO is a completely different game than regular  
1:16
SEO. In regular SEO, you're trying to rank your  website's URLs. But in local SEO, you're trying to  
1:21
rank your Google business profile. And Google uses  three main factors to decide which businesses show  
1:27
up in those top three spots. Proximity, relevance,  and authority. Let me show you exactly how those  
1:33
three factors work. These three glasses represent  three businesses that are all trying to rank their  
1:38
Google business profile. Now, I mentioned three  important categories to build that rank. We have   trust, we have authority, and we have proximity.  Now, proximity is how far away the searcher is  
1:51
from your particular business. So for this first  one, maybe the searcher is pretty far away.  
1:56
For the second one, the searcher is quite a bit  closer. And for the third business, the searcher   is in the business's doorstep. Now our second  category is relevance. How much relevance does  
2:06
each one of these businesses have? Our third  business, not very much relevance. They have   a very small website, handful of pages. Second  business, same thing. Not very much relevance,  
2:14
handful of pages. The third business, they watch  this video, they built a massive amount of topical  
2:20
relevance. And finally, we have authority. The  first business, they have a couple of simple   links from some blog posts, but you know what?  That's enough for their glass to overflow, from  
2:29
them to rank. Second business, they spent a little  bit more effort. They got a little bit more links,   and they're also overflowing and ranking. Now, our  third business, they have a long way to go, as you  
2:38
can see. And they've done that by joining chambers  of commerce, by sponsoring local sports teams,   by doing everything they need to do to make sure  their glass overflows also. and they can overcome  
2:47
that massive penalty by being simply too far  away. Now, here's the good news about all of this.  
2:53
Most of your local competitors are doing the bare  minimum. You're trying to outrank Joe the plumber  
2:58
who uses Yahoo to figure out where to go to log  into the Google business profile. They filled out   their Google business profile once 3 years ago  and they called it dumb. They have one category  
3:08
when Google allows 10. They have zero services  listed when they should have 30. their glasses  
3:13
are barely half full because they're ignoring two  of the three factors, the only two factors they  
3:18
can actually control. That's why it can be so easy  to outrank established businesses, even if they've  
3:23
been around for decades. They're not playing the  game. They don't even know there's a game to play.   So, if you understand these three factors and  you build your website and your Google business  
3:31
profile to maximize the relevance and authority,  the two you can control, you can rank a business  
3:36
in weeks, not in months. But here's what you need  to understand. You are not trying to rank blog  
3:42
posts. Any SEO agency pitching you on weekly blog  posts, run away from them. Don't walk. You're not  
3:47
trying to get traffic from people in other cities  reading your content. Every single page on your   local business website exists for one reason, to  help your Google business profile rank higher in  
3:57
the map. And remember those three glasses I just  showed you? We're going to fill each one until it   overflows without needing proximity throughout  this process. We're going to build relevance  
4:06
through content. We're going to build authority  through links. and we're going to watch your   rankings get better and better as the glasses fill  up. This changes everything about how you approach  
4:14
content, how you structure your site, and what  success actually looks like in local SEO. And this  
4:19
is the foundation that determines whether you're  going to rank in weeks or struggle for years. Now,   we never start optimization until we run this  first diagnostic step. It tells us exactly what  
4:29
type of local content we need to produce for a  client. It's a local rank map. It's going to show   your Google Business Profile's ranking position  at 169 different points across your city. Green  
4:39
means you're in the top three. You're visible.  You're getting calls. Yellow means positions   four through 10 or so, and you're completely  invisible, but close to breaking into the top  
4:47
three. Red means you're not going to get found.  Google simply does not believe that your business  
4:53
does that service in that location. And this map  is going to tell us everything we need to know   about what to do next. Here's an example local  rank map. This is for a plumber in Houston. Here's  
5:03
another example. This is for a plumber in Gary,  Indiana. I can actually pull up any number of So,  
5:08
if I pull up this rank map, it looks a little  bit worse. And if I come all the way down here,   you know, this plumber is not getting very many  calls from Google search. We can see all the 20s,  
5:17
a little bit of green, some yellow and orange,  and that's what we have. Now, most SEO agencies,  
5:22
especially ones that can't rank businesses, they  just start creating content randomly. They write   blog posts about general plumbing topics. They  target keywords that have a high search volume.  
5:32
They're guessing. But if you run a rank map  first, you're not guessing anymore. When you   look at these rank maps, most businesses, they're  mainly red and yellow and a little bit of green  
5:41
right next to the business address. That tells  us that that business needs proximity to win. So,   they only win close to their location. Google  doesn't trust them to rank them anywhere else.  
5:50
They need more relevance and more authority.  That means direct targeted content and links.   And that's exactly where we started with our  client in Plano, Texas, positioned 17 on average,  
6:00
barely any green on the map after implementing  the system. They went from 17 to 2.35 in just 2  
6:06
weeks and generated over $50,000 in new revenue  for the next month. Here's what that plumber in  
6:11
Plano looks like once we've built enough  relevance and authority that Google ranks   them across the entire service area. But here's  what matters most about that rank map. There's  
6:20
one specific metric that determines our entire  strategy going forward. It's called the top 3%.   We take the total area on the map and calculate  what percentage is green. Positions one, two,  
6:29
or three. If you're at 40% top three, that tells  us a very important thing. If you're at 1%, that   tells us something completely different about what  we need to do next. Do we build topical content or  
6:39
geographic content? If we get that decision wrong,  we're going to waste months creating content that   won't move your rankings at all. I'm going to  show you exactly how we use this metric when we  
6:49
talk about building relevance later on in this  video. It's going to be the decision point that   changes everything around how we plan our content  strategy. But first, I need to make sure that the  
6:57
foundation is actually set up correctly. Because  if it's not, most local businesses are making  
7:02
three massive mistakes in their Google business  profile and it's going to keep them invisible.   And I've seen the same pattern in over 500 GBP  audits. Now, the first mistake is categories.  
7:13
Most businesses I look at choose one category.  They're primary and they just stop there. But   Google allows you to choose up to 10 categories.  And here's why that matters. Every single category  
7:22
you add is another search term that Google might  show you for. If you're a plumber and you only   have plumber as your category, you're missing  out on searches for drainage service and gas  
7:31
installation service. Typically, we want two  to four categories minimum as long as they're   relevant. We can go a lot more as long as it  makes sense for your business. So, how do we  
7:41
choose the right categories? I like to use a  tool called GMBB Everywhere. It makes it very,   very easy to do this. Let me show you exactly  how. So GMBB Everywhere is a Chrome plugin. So  
7:50
I have it installed. That's why we see all these  boxes. And once we do a search on maps.google.com,  
7:56
you can see I search for plumber Houston. I can  come to one of these and I can hit find more. That   opens up this helpful category finder. So it's  going to start on the top by showing me all the  
8:05
categories that this business has chosen for their  GBP and how many GBPs have that category. One and  
8:11
a half million used plumber and then we have air  conditioning contractor etc etc. But here's what  
8:16
makes this so valuable in choosing the best GBP  categories for your business. Right below that we  
8:21
have related categories. So we can see one and a  half million plumbers. We have 15,000 that chose  
8:26
draining service. 110,000 chose plumbing supply  store. We have plumbers merchant. 60,000 chose  
8:32
septic system, septic tank service, and another  60 heating contractor etc etc etc. So doing this,  
8:38
we can very quickly see which businesses  chose which related categories to get very  
8:43
strong ideas that we can use for our secondary  categories to make sure we're targeting two,  
8:48
three, or four at minimum. On top of that, I also  like to use an AI prompt to help choose strategic  
8:54
categories. Between GMBB everywhere and this  prompt, you're going to have the right categories   chosen in like 5 minutes. So that's mistake  number one fixed. Here's that prompt on screen.
9:07
Now, you do have to be careful. AI has a  tendency to just make up GBP categories. So,   it can be helpful to grab a long list of all of  the categories and give that to AI and tell it  
9:16
to choose from the list. So, the second mistake  is services. Most businesses have maybe one, two,  
9:22
maybe five services listed if someone told  them it mattered, it was super important,   but you should have at least 20 services listed  on your Google profile. Why 20? Because every  
9:32
service you list is another signal to Google about  what you actually do. And in competitive markets,   you might actually need 30, 40, or more services  to compete. So, here's what's different from  
9:41
categories. Services need to be categorized,  optimized by which category they're most relevant   to. So, under your plumber category, you're going  to list things like water heater replacement,  
9:50
pipe repair, or leak detection. Google  is looking at whether your services   semantically match your categories. If they  do, that's a relevant signal. If they don't,  
9:58
you're confusing the algorithm. Remember,  Google is just math. The great thing about   services is it's a free box. You can type  whatever you want in. Be creative. Here  
10:07
is an excellent prompt to help you generate  services based on the categories you have.
10:15
Now, the third mistake is a simple one. It's  leaving boxes empty on your GBP. Google gives  
10:21
you a business description field, an attribute  section, a product section, services, which we   just covered, photos, posts. Most businesses fill  out their name, address, phone number. Maybe they  
10:29
upload a logo and leave a lot of the rest blank.  So, here's what you need to understand. Google's   algorithm is looking at completion signals. A  fully completed profile signals that this is an  
10:38
active, legitimate business. An empty profile  signals that maybe this business doesn't exist   anymore, or maybe it's spam, or maybe the business  owner doesn't care. None of those are good. So,  
10:48
you need to fill out every single box.  Your business description should target   750 characters. That's the maximum that Google  allows. Use all of it. photos. Put at least 20  
11:00
photos on their GBP. Exterior photos, interior  photos, team photos, work in progress photos.   Google wants to see that you're a real business.  If you take these photos with your phone, they're  
11:08
going to be geotagged automatically. GBP posts.  I'll show you how to automate this in a minute.   You should be doing that. Attributes. Check every  attribute box that applies. If it doesn't apply,  
11:17
still check it, but check no. Veteranowned,  womanowned, except credit cards, free estimates,   ADA compliant, bathroom, whatever is relevant.  This entire audit, categories, services,  
11:25
filling out every box should take you about a half  hour. And it's going to put you ahead of 90% of   your local competitors immediately. Honestly,  80% of local businesses can get to a point  
11:35
where they have enough top 3% to be a six-figure  business just by doing these basic things. Now,  
11:40
I'm going to put the full GBP audit guide we use  every day at my agency in the school community.   A link is in the description. There are nearly  3,000 SEO professionals there, and my team and I  
11:50
help answer questions about SEO. Now, your Google  business profile is only half of the equation. If  
11:55
your website doesn't match what you put in your  GBP, Google won't build enough relevance for  
12:00
competitive market. Google is checking if your  website and GBP belong to the same business.   If you fail this test, you're not going to rank  in a competitive market. Your GBP landing page,  
12:09
that's what I refer to as the URL you put in  your website field of your Google business   profile. For most single location businesses,  it's just your homepage. Google is looking at  
12:18
that page to verify that your website and your  GBP are the same business. If they don't match,  
12:24
Google assumes one of them is fake or that you  don't know. So, here are seven consistency signals  
12:30
that page must have. I'll show them on screen  here while I walk through. First, your title tag   must include your primary category and your city  name. It should be something like Houston plumber  
12:39
same day service brand name. I analyzed over a 100  local businesses a couple months ago and over 60%  
12:44
of them had the word home or just their business  name as the title tag. They're making it easy for   you to outrank them. Okay. Second, your H1 needs  to match. It has to include your primary category  
12:53
and your city name. Third, you want to have a  Google Maps embed of your GBP location on the  
12:58
page. Google makes this super easy to do. Fourth,  your secondary categories and that core service   should be mentioned ideally in the subheading.  Fifth, you need to have a review widget to display  
13:08
Google Business reviews on your homepage. Sixth,  your address needs to match your GBP address   character for character. And seventh, your phone  number needs to match character for character.  
13:17
I'll even give you a bonus eighth to make sure you  have local business schema on that homepage. Also,   these seven elements create what Google calls  consistency signals. The more consistent your  
13:27
website is with your GP, the more Google trusts  that they belong to the same business. Now,   here's something that most people don't know.  Google invented the transformer technology back  
13:35
in 2017. That's the same tech that powers chat GPT  and every other AI you've ever heard of. In fact,  
13:41
the T in chat GPT actually stands for transformer.  Both Google search and chat GPT care about the  
13:47
same thing, consistency. When someone asks Chat  GPT for a plumber recommendation in Houston,  
13:52
it's checking very similar signals to what  Google is checking. Is the business information   consistent? Does the address match? Are the  services clearly listed? And here's why chat  
14:01
GPT optimization builds even more trust  than Google. When you show up on Google,   it's a vote of trust from the algorithm. But when  chat GPT recommends you, that feels like a friend  
14:10
recommending someone. It's personal. It's trusted.  So when a customer finds you on both Google   and you're recommended by Chat GPT, man, those  customers are sold before they even call you. And  
14:20
that's what this whole system is built on. Using  your website to prove to Google and to AI tools   that your business is to be trusted. All right. So  those are the basics. Now, I want to finish this  
14:30
foundation by automating the ongoing management  so you don't spend hours every week on this. Once   your GBP is optimized and your landing page is  consistent, we need to keep the GBP active. Google  
14:40
is watching for activity signals. Businesses that  post regularly, respond to reviews, upload photos,   active profiles rank higher than dormant ones.  It's as simple as that. But I know nobody wants  
14:50
to spend 2 hours every week manually writing GVP  posts and uploading photos. Can you imagine? We  
14:56
had to do that back in 2021. So, we connect the  GVP to a management tool that's going to automate  
15:02
nearly all of this. The tool we use at my agency  is called Lead Snap. Use whichever one you like,   but this is the exact system we use to manage  hundreds of client profiles. I'm going to put  
15:11
a link in the description that'll get you  half off the first three months to try Lead   Snap. It's going to save you hours per week  or saves you from paying some other company  
15:19
$300 a month to set up these automations for  you just one time. But that is pretty solid   long-term profit for those agencies. So, here's  what we're going to automate. First, weekly GVP  
15:29
posts. Most businesses post once and forget about  it for 6 months. We're going to post every single   week with one prompt that generates 52 posts,  one for every week of the year. Schedule all 52  
15:38
posts in Lead Snap and you're done for the entire  year. Second, weekly geotech photo uploads. Now,   here's something interesting. Yes, I know Google  strips the meta data when photos are uploaded,  
15:47
but we consistently see more rank movement  when we do weekly geote photos than we do   non-geeote. This is almost certainly because most  smartphones will automatically geoteag photos. So,  
15:58
Google is expecting to see photos with meta data.  Plus, tools like Lead Snap will automatically  
16:03
geotag on upload now, so there's no real extra  work involved. Okay. And third, AI powered review  
16:08
responses. This takes roughly 25 seconds to set up  and it handles all review responses automatically.  
16:13
Fourth, automated citations to Apple Maps, Bing  for Business, Yelp, all the major directories that   require business verification. set it up once,  takes maybe an hour to connect everything and  
16:22
schedule the post, and then your GBP stays active  all year without you having to touch it. So,   that is the complete foundation, GBP optimized,  landing page optimized, management automated. Now,  
16:32
in the next 10 minutes or so, I know this video is  going long, but I promised a full guide. I'm going   to show you the website structure that got that  Plano plumber from position 17 to 2.35. And it's  
16:42
nothing like what most SEO agencies are doing. I  call it the core 30. And here's why. If you have  
16:47
three to four categories and 20 to 30 services  on your GBP, you're going to end up with about   30 pages of content. One homepage, three to four  category pages, and 25 to 30 service pages comes  
16:58
to around 30 pages. And these 30 pages create the  foundation of topical relevance that Google needs  
17:03
to see before it will rank you in competitive  markets. So, let me tell you exactly how this   works. The homepage is your GBP landing page. We  already covered what needs to be on that page,  
17:12
all eight consistency elements. But here's what  most people miss. The homepage also needs to do  
17:17
more than just mention your secondary categories.  So if your primary category is plumber and your   secondary categories are drainage service  and gas installation service, each of those  
17:25
secondary categories gets an H2, a subheading on  your homepage. Under that subheading, write 50 to  
17:31
100 words about that category. What it is, why  customers need it, what services fall under it,   how good you are at doing it. And then this  is critical, link from that paragraph to a  
17:41
dedicated category page. Not a navigation link,  not a footer link, an editorial link, a link that  
17:47
appears in the context, in the paragraph that  tells Google exactly what that page is going to   be about. Because here's what most people don't  understand. Navigation links and footer links  
17:55
barely pass any authority. Google knows these are  just site structure. They're not endorsements.  
18:00
Editorial links, links in your content pass real  authority. Google sees those and understands that  
18:06
this page is recommending this other page. So from  your homepage, you're going to have three to four   editorial links going to your category pages. Now,  let's look at a category page. The target keyword  
18:16
for your category pages is the category name plus  the city name, drainage service, Houston. That's   going to go in your title tag. That's going to go  in your H1, your primary heading. And then on that  
18:25
category page, you're going to list the services  that are most relevant to that category. Each one  
18:30
gets an H2 subheading. You're going to write 50 to  100 words about that specific service. And you're  
18:37
going to link from that paragraph to a dedicated  service page. So from each category page,   you might have 5 to 10 editorial links to the  service pages. Are we seeing the pattern here?  
18:46
Homepage links to the category pages. Category  pages link to the service pages. It mirrors your  
18:51
GBP structure exactly. Google looks at this and it  sees all of these internal links. a comprehensive,  
18:57
wellorganized website that matches exactly what  you already told it in your Google business  
19:03
profile. Okay, so let's look at a service  page. The target keyword is the service name   plus the city name. Water heater replacement  Houston, emergency plumber Houston. Title tag,  
19:12
primary heading, same pattern. And then you write  detailed content about that specific service. Why  
19:18
customers need it, what it includes, how long  it takes, what to expect. This is where you   get specific. This is not generic plumbing advice.  This is not five ways to tell if your water heater  
19:27
needs to be replaced. This is specific information  about this exact service in this exact city. Now,  
19:33
here's the question everyone asks.  How do you write 30 pages of unique,   high-quality content without spending weeks on it?  Okay, you're already using AI to write content.  
19:41
I certainly hope you are at least. But here's  what most people get wrong. Google doesn't care   if content is written by AI or by humans. Google  cares if content is helpful. And most AI content  
19:52
isn't helpful because it's generic. It's vague.  It's walls of text with no formatting, no images,  
19:57
no personality. Let me give you the prompt we  use to generate better content for local SEO.
20:18
But you still need a human editor to go through  and add real business personality and voice.  
20:24
Images, client photos are best, AI generated  works, callouts, tables, proper formatting,   headers, bullet points, short paragraphs, internal  links connecting the pages together. Because  
20:32
here's what Google is actually evaluating. They're  looking at your pages on the most recent version   of mobile Chrome. If your page looks like a wall  of AI slop with no images and no formatting,  
20:43
Google will think, "Boy, this page looks like a  wall of AI slop." So, build the content with AI,  
20:48
but make sure it looks like a real website that  a real business would have. When you're done with   the core 30, you have 30 pages of content that  matches your GBP categories and services exactly.  
20:58
They all use target keywords consistently. They  link together in a clear hierarchy. They look   professional and well-designed. This is proof  to Google that you are comprehensive and you  
21:07
are legitimate. This is what topical relevance  looks like. 30 pages all proving you actually   do what you say you do. This is filling up the  glass, the relevance class that we talked about  
21:16
at the beginning of this video. But even perfect  content won't rank without one more component.   We still need authority. After AI took over the  internet, Google changed how it evaluates content  
21:26
quality. So here's what actually works now. Way  back in 1999, Sergey Brin and Larry Pageige had  
21:33
an insight that would lead to a multi- trillion  dollar company. You can read about their Stanford   PhD dissertation all about this tonight if you're  having trouble sleeping. But the insight was  
21:43
simple. Quality websites don't link to spam. If  a trusted website links to your page, it's a vote  
21:48
of confidence. Your page is probably pretty  good. That insight built Google's algorithm,  
21:53
and it's still the foundation of how Google's  algorithm works today. But here's what changed   in 2023. In November, AI content started flooding  the internet. Millions of pages of AI generated  
22:05
content appeared overnight and most of it was  garbage. Generic, unhelpful, lowquality slop.  
22:11
Google needed a way to separate the AI slop from  content that was actually useful. And the answer   was the same as it's always been. Links. If  you have AI generated content on your site,  
22:21
which you should because AI makes this process  possible, you're going to need external links   proving the content is quality. Without links,  Google has no way to verify that your content is  
22:31
trustworthy and worthy of its searchers spending  time on it. With links, Google sees that other   sites trust your content enough to link to it.  So, for the core 30, you're going to need two  
22:40
types of links. The first type I call this is not  AI slop links. These are medium quality external  
22:46
links that validate your content is worth reading.  They don't need to be local. They don't need to be   from the most powerful domains on the internet.  They just need to be from reasonable sites. And  
22:56
you're going to need one per page at a minimum.  So for your 30 core 30 pages, that's 30 external  
23:01
links. Say that three times fast. Now, where do  you get these links? You can search them yourself   if you know how. You can reach out to relevant  blogs, to websites. You can use services that  
23:09
provide quality links. I actually run one of those  services. It's called the ice cream truck shop   that does this. There's a link in the description  if you want to check it out. We charge about $35  
23:16
per link. And now that might sound like a lot  until you remember that ranking in top three in   even a small city can easily generate six figures  in revenue per year. The Plano plumber I mentioned  
23:27
$50,000 in revenue in the next month alone from  the few thousand investment in doing content and  
23:33
links for his site. So these not AI swap links  tell Google that your content is legitimate and   trustworthy. But these links alone won't get you  to the top three. For that you need the second  
23:41
type of link, local authority links. These  are links from websites and organizations in   your local area that signal to Google that you  are a real trusted legitimate business in that  
23:51
community. And the absolute best local authority  link that you can get is your local chamber of  
23:56
commerce. Most cities charge between $200 and  $300 per year for a chamber membership. You  
24:02
join the chamber, they add your business to their  directory, and you get a link from their website   back to yours. Now, here's what makes chamber  links so powerful. Google recognizes chambers  
24:11
of commerce as local authority site. A link from  a chamber of commerce tells Google this business   is legitimate. They're active in the community  and they're trusted. It's one of the strongest  
24:20
local trust signals that you can get. And here's  a secret most SEOs don't know. You can actually   join multiple chambers. If there are three or four  chambers of commerce within 70 mi of your business  
24:30
location, join all of them. I've had clients where  we join 10 different chambers of commerce. Each   one costs a couple hundred a year. It's usually  based on the number of employees that you have,  
24:39
but each one is a massive vote of trust, of local  trust. The chambers themselves, they don't care if  
24:45
you're 30 m outside the primary city, as long  as you're paying the membership fee. Beyond   chambers, you want to look out for other local  organizations, youth sports leagues that need  
24:54
sponsorships, local charities, community events,  any local organization that has a website and will  
24:59
link to your local business if you sponsor them.  Now, clearly, most of these opportunities cost   money. You're sponsoring a little league team  for a few hundred dollars or you're donating to  
25:08
a charity gala event, but you're getting real  local links that Google values. And like to be  
25:14
honest here, these sponsorships and donations  are actually good for your business anyway.   You're building real community connections.  You're not just buying links. Of course,  
25:22
if we put our SEO blinders on, then yes, we're  also buying great links. Now, I used to have an   employee who spent almost all of her time just  looking for these organizations. Now, she mostly  
25:32
does a lot of graphic design work because of the  prompt I'm going to show you right now on screen.
25:44
Now, as before, this prompt is available in the  prompt library located in my school community link  
25:49
in the description. Okay, everything is built now.  The core 30 pages with perfect structure, links,   proving your quality and local. Both of these  glasses are now filled relevance and authority. So  
26:00
now here's how we know if it's actually working.  And this is the decision point that determines   what you do next. Remember at the beginning when  I showed you the local rank map? Let's go back to  
26:09
it now. 30 days after you've launched the core 30,  it's time to start running more rank maps for your  
26:15
target keyword. Maybe it's your primary category,  plumber Houston. Maybe it's a core service,   water heater replacement Houston. Whatever  keyword you're targeting, run the rank map  
26:23
for that keyword. And now you're going to look  for one specific very, very important metric,  
26:28
top 3%. So take the total area on your map and  calculate what percentage is green. Positions one,  
26:34
two, and three. As I said before, position four  and worse is completely invisible. No one is  
26:39
going to click on position four. So we only  count green. Lead snap is going to give you   this data automatically. So if you're at 40% top  three, that tells us one thing. If you're at 1%,  
26:48
that tells us something else. And that number,  that top 3% determines whether we build topical  
26:54
content or geographical content. Next, let me  walk you through how that decision works. Okay,  
26:59
first look at your top competitors. Run rank maps  for the top three or four businesses that are   dominating your keyword. Look at what their top 3%  is. In highly competitive markets, the top players  
27:09
will be at 30 or 40% at best. It's exceptionally  difficult to rank everywhere because of the  
27:15
competition in these highly competitive markets.  Now, in less competitive markets, the top players   might be a 99%. So that number, the top 3% of the  big dogs in your area, is your goal. That's where  
27:26
you want to be in a month or two. Let me show  you a couple of examples to make this a little   bit more clear. Okay, so here we are in Gary,  Indiana looking at the search for plumber. And  
27:35
we can see the top player is at 94% top three in  this region. Then number two, we drop to 79, 26,  
27:42
etc. So if you're a plumber in Gary, I'm going to  think, boy, I really want to be in the 90 to 95%  
27:48
range on the top three. I can see it's possible  to achieve that. AJ has. So that's going to be my  
27:53
goal. Now if I flip over and show Houston, the top  player in Houston, obviously much more competitive  
27:59
than Gary, Indiana. The top player here is running  28 1/2%. Much worse than Gary. And then we drop  
28:06
immediately down to 13 and 12, 11, etc. So here,  if I'm a plumber in Houston, I'm thinking 25 to  
28:14
30% is about as good as I'm going to be able to  do because Houston is so much more competitive  
28:19
than Gary, Indiana. So to decide what content  to produce next, we're going to think about a  
28:25
target of 25 to 50% of your goal. So if the top  players are at 80%, your threshold is 30 to 40. If  
28:33
the top players are at 40%, your threshold is 15  to 20. That is your topical relevance threshold.  
28:39
If you're below that threshold, Google doesn't  trust you yet. Google doesn't believe that you   actually perform that service with a level of  expertise that your competitors have. You need  
28:48
more topical relevance, more content proving you  know what you're talking about. But if you're at   or above your topical relevance threshold,  that's a sign that Google trusts you. Google  
28:57
believes you're an authority on this service. So  now the strategy shifts. You don't need to prove   you're an expert. You need to expand how far away  from your address you can rank. So we're going to  
29:06
shift to building geographical relevance. This  decision point is critical because honestly most  
29:11
agencies don't do this or they get it backwards.  They start immediately building location pages.  
29:16
Plumber and Memorial Heights, plumber in River  Oaks before they've proven topical authority.   And those location pages do nothing because Google  just doesn't trust them yet. Or they keep building  
29:26
topical content forever answering every FAQ they  can find when they've already proven authority and  
29:31
that they should be expanding geographically. The  rank map and the top three metric tell you exactly  
29:36
where you are and what to do next. If you're below  your threshold, you need more topical relevance.   And I'm going to show you exactly how to build  that next. If you're at or above your threshold,  
29:46
it's time for geographical relevance. I'll walk  through that after I talk about topical. So,   starting with topical relevance. What to do when  Google doesn't trust you're an expert yet. So,  
29:55
when Google doesn't believe you're an authority,  throwing more service pages at it won't help. You   need supporting content. Google doesn't trust you  perform this service at the level your competitors  
30:05
do. So, you need to prove otherwise. And the  way you do this is by answering questions. Now,   here's where most SEO agencies get this completely  wrong. They'll tell you to write blog posts,  
30:14
generic blog posts about 10 signs you need a new  water heater, or I don't know, the history of  
30:19
plumbing in America. Or they'll tell you to create  city pages, plumber in Houston, plumber in Katie,   plumber in Sugarland. Just changing the city name  and calling it content. These tactics don't work.  
30:29
Please stop paying SEO agencies who are doing  this. I know these tactics don't work. And I   know that SEO agencies still do this. Because  when I post videos on my channel explaining  
30:39
why blog posts like this are a waste of time for  local businesses, do you know what happens in the   comments? I get SEO agencies asking, "If we're  not writing blog posts, what do we charge our  
30:48
clients for?" Think about that. If you're a local  business owner, think about that. The priority for   these SEO agencies isn't getting you results. It's  finding something to charge for. That's backwards.  
30:58
Their top priority is charging clients. Don't  work with agencies like that, please. Okay? What  
31:03
you're building here are not blog posts. They're  highly targeted supporting content pages built to   answer specific questions that the rank map shows  you're not ranking for. Every piece of content has  
31:12
a purpose. Every page is connected to your core 30  structure. Nothing is generic. Nothing is fluffy.  
31:18
Now, think about this. When someone is an expert,  they can easily answer detailed questions about   their field. They know the nuances. They know  the problems people actually have. This is what  
31:27
Google is looking for. So, you're going to find  FAQs, frequently asked questions related to the  
31:32
target keyword, and you're going to answer them  comprehensively. So, there are two main sources   for finding these questions. The first is Google's  people also ask section. Go to Google and search  
31:42
for your target keyword. Plumber, water heater  replacement. Leave the city name off and whatever   you're targeting. Scroll down and you'll usually  see a people also ask section with four or five  
31:51
questions. Click on any question and more will  appear. Keep clicking and you can easily find 20   to 30 relevant questions. Here's a quick example.  I type in plumber and then I can find right here  
31:59
people also ask. And if I click on this a few  times, I get more and more and more people also  
32:06
ask questions that keep showing up. Now, here's  what you need to know. Do not copy these questions  
32:11
word for word. I used to say to copy them word  for word. Every SEO I know used to say to copy  
32:16
them word for word. The problem is SEOs have  abused this people also ask section. They've   abused it so much that Google is getting wise to  it. So, if you just copy the exact question and  
32:25
structure content around them, Google's going to  know what you're doing. It's not going to build as   much authority. So, instead, we're going to reword  the question. Use a different word order. Make  
32:32
sure they mean the same thing, but phrase them  slightly differently. Google will understand. It's   built on the same transformer technology that chat  GPT uses. So, how much does it cost to replace a  
32:40
water heater becomes what's the typical price for  water heater replacement? It's the same question,   just different words. Okay. The second source is  Reddit. Rather than scrolling Reddit yourself,  
32:49
grab this prompt. Give the prompt your city  and your service and it's going to go and crawl   Reddit, find questions that real people in your  area are asking about your service on Reddit. Now,  
32:59
these are gold because they, like I said, they're  actual local questions from real people. These are   not generic people also ask questions. They're  specific about your service in your city.
33:15
Once you have these FAQs from these two different  sources, here's how you're going to use them.   You're going to add the question to the relevant  page on your site. If it's a general plumbing  
33:23
question, it's going to go on your homepage  or the main plumbing category page. If it's   specific to water heaters, it goes on your water  heater service page. If it's about drain lines,  
33:32
it goes on your drain line page. Then you're  going to answer the question briefly, a couple   dozen words, just enough to give a quick answer.  Then you're going to add an editorial link right  
33:42
in that content. Contextual natural something  like water heater replacement typically costs  
33:47
between $2,000 and $4,000 in Houston depending  on the type and installation complexity. For   a detailed breakdown of pricing factors, see our  complete guide to water heater replacement costs.  
33:56
That link goes to a new supporting content page  where you're then going to answer that question   in depth. Hundreds of words, really, really  comprehensive. Now, here's the prompt we use.  
34:06
Have AI generate these FAQs and specifically  call out which question should have their own   detailed explanation page. Pause the video,  grab this prompt just like the other ones,  
34:14
or join my school community and get them  there along with my full prompt library.
34:28
Now, this FAQ process does two things.  First, it adds value to your main pages   without bloating them with massive walls of  text. Second, it creates internal linking  
34:37
from your core 30 pages to supporting content  pages. Google follows these links and sees that  
34:42
you have depth on this topic. And here's what's  critical. Every supporting content page needs   one of these not AI slop links. You created 30  core 30 pages and got 30 external links. Now,  
34:53
you're creating 10 or 20 supporting content pages,  and you're going to need 10 or 20 more external   links. These supporting content pages prove  to Google that you have real expertise. You're  
35:02
not just listing services. You're answering the  questions that customers actually have. And keep  
35:07
building these supporting content until you hit  your top 3% threshold. If your threshold was 30%,  
35:12
you're at 15. Keep building supporting content and  running rank maps every month until you hit 30%.   And once you hit that threshold, the strategy  completely changes. Now you're not trying to  
35:22
prove expertise anymore. Google believes you're an  expert. Now you're trying to expand how far away   from your address you can rank and that's called  geographic relevance. So look at your rank map.  
35:31
You're ranking in some areas but you're going  to have gaps. Areas are in position four, five,   six, almost there but not quite. You're trying to  expand your coverage area. And the way you do it  
35:41
is geographical content targeted at specific  landmarks. And here's how this works. Let me  
35:46
show you. So we'll do it here with our plumber  in Houston. And I'm going to look for four,   fives, and sixes. So if I see some fours up here,  we'll zoom in a bit. And I'm using this Google  
35:55
Maps interface because I want to use geographic  areas that Google sees as relevant, not ones that  
36:00
I've made up. If it's on Google Maps, it's  relevant. So this number four, so I'm going   to write plumber Maple Leaf Gardens, Houston.  I'm going to write plumber Wagen Wheel Estates,  
36:10
Houston. I'm going to write plumber near the  intersection of Windfield Road and Fallbook Drive,  
36:15
Houston. I'm going to write plumber Harvest Bend,  the Meadows, Houston. Right. Maybe I'll do What  
36:20
do we have here? Do we have a lake? No lake name  there. No problem. So, we're looking for lakes.   We're looking for parks, right? So, I can use  this one. Plumber, Ranchstone, Houston. And this  
36:30
is what's important, okay? These need to be areas  where people who actually need your service live.  
36:35
Not like out in the middle of nowhere, not in the  middle of Lake Michigan where there's actual real   search volume. So, use your judgment here. You  want areas with good demographics, neighborhoods,  
36:44
residential areas, places where your customers  are. Matt, here's why you target positions   four through six. It's much easier to move from  position four to three than it is from position 19  
36:54
to position three. And if you move from position  19 to position four, that doesn't really get you   anything. It's top three that matters. So, you're  already close with four, five, or six, you just  
37:03
need a little more geographical relevance to push  you over the edge. So, once you've identified that   area and you found that geographical landmark, you  have your target keyword to start writing content  
37:12
to build the geographical relevance. I showed  you a couple of examples. neighborhood names,   park names, major intersection, shopping center,  schools, any landmark that Google recognizes on  
37:22
Google Maps. And then, as I said, your target  keyword is service landmark city. That target   keyword goes in your title tag. It goes in your  H1 tag. And here's an AI prompt that can help with  
37:33
this content prioritization, especially with  the demographic data. So, take your rank map,  
37:38
whatever software you're using, grab the CSV data  from it, and give it to AI along with this prompt.
37:52
and then write content that's actually about that  area. Not just we serve Memorial Park repeated 50  
37:58
times. Talk about the neighborhood. Talk about the  common plumbing issues in that area. Maybe it's   older homes with cast iron pipes. Maybe it's newer  construction with PEX plumbing. Reference local  
38:06
businesses nearby. Make it genuinely local. AI is  going to do this really, really well. Talk about  
38:12
the driving route that your technicians use to  get to that neighborhood or the driving route that   your customers would take if they're visiting your  location. And just like with supporting content,  
38:21
every geographic page needs one of those not  AI slop links. You're going to build 10 20  
38:27
of these geographical pages. That's another 10 to  20 external links you need. Now, these supporting   geographical pages, you also need to internally  link them to the pages they're supported. So,  
38:36
create a locations page or similar that has  links to all of the geographic pages. Then   if your geographical page is about water heater  replacement memorial heights, link to the water  
38:46
heater replacement page. Then just keep running  that rank map every couple of weeks. Look for   new areas where you're now in positions four  through six because as you build authority,  
38:53
you're going to start appearing in more and more  places. Target the new areas. Keep expanding   outward from your address. What you'll see on  the rank map is the green zone growing. First,  
39:02
it's just around your address. Then it expands in  the neighborhood areas. Then it keeps spreading.   That's geographical relevance in action. Look at  this map for a client of mine in downtown Chicago.  
39:11
The green dots are almost 5 million people. We  did that by starting with topical relevance,  
39:17
then shifting to geographical relevance, and  steadily growing it by producing more and more   geographical relevance. Just keep doing this.  Alternate between topical content when needed  
39:26
and geographical content when you're above  threshold until, like this client in Chicago,   you're dominating your entire service area. So  monitor your rank map. Check your top 3%. Decide  
39:37
what type of content to build next. This is a  system. This is repeatable. This is a process.  
39:42
We're not guessing. We're not publishing random  content based on what we feel like. You've built   the core 30. You've added supporting content  for topical relevance. You've created geographic  
39:50
pages to expand your coverage. Your rank map is  showing green everywhere. Now what? This is when  
39:56
most agencies drop the ball if they can get there  to begin with. They think the work is done. They   stop monitoring. They stop producing content. and  3 months later, a competitor who's still actively  
40:05
building content pushes them out of the top three.  So, here's the continuous loop. Every month,   run your rank map. Check your top three metric.  Look at where you're still weak. Are you below  
40:12
threshold? More topical content. At threshold,  build geographical content. Dominating everywhere.  
40:18
Maintain and defend. Keep your GBP active with  the automated posts and photos. Respond to every  
40:23
review. Add new services as your business evolves.  Think about adding another GBP location. Monitor  
40:29
for competitor movement. The system scales as  your business grows. Maybe you start with one   location and dominate that city. Then you open  a second location, run the same system, new GBP,  
40:38
new core 30, supporting and geographical content  specific to that area. The fundamentals don't   change. Remember those three glasses: proximity,  relevance, authority, core 30, supporting content,  
40:49
geographical content, links, proving quality,  and local trust. You now have the complete  
40:54
system that's ranked hundreds of businesses  in the top three. Every step, every tool,   every strategy, that foundation, GBP audit,  landing page optimization, automated management,  
41:04
the core 30, the website structure that proves  topical relevance, links, the not AI slop links,   and the local authority links that build  trust. Decision framework, use the rank map,  
41:13
and top 3% to know exactly what content to build  next, topical relevance, supporting content   that proves expertise, geographical content,  location pages that expand your coverage area,  
41:22
and the ongoing loop that keeps you ranked as  you scale. All the prompts I showed you today   are of course in my school community. There's a  link in the description. You can copy and paste  
41:31
those into claude. That's my preferred tool, not  chat GPT, and you'll be ready to go. We use Lead   Snap for GBP management. Again, I have a link  in the description. The it'll give you half off  
41:41
for the first 3 months when you use it. You  know this system. You know this works. Now,   you need clients to use this on. So, I have  a video that shows you the exact Facebook ad  
41:49
campaign that we use to land 30 clients in 30  days. It's going to give you the targeting,   the ad copy, the images, the complete  campaign structure, everything you need  
41:58
to fill your pipeline. So, click there, go watch  it, and I'll see you inside the school community


------------------

of this stuff and steal it from me. Thanks for watching, and I'm going to get straight into the course. AI SEO in
1:00
2026 is completely different from everything you've been taught. And the old playbook has pretty much been
1:05
chucked out the window. Google has just changed how they rank content across YouTube, Reddit, traditional search. And
1:11
here's the wild part. Most business owners are still doing SEO the 2019 way,
1:17
whilst AI is writing and rewriting the rules pretty much every single week. So today, I'm going to show you the exact
1:23
multi-platform SEO system that's working right now in 2026. You'll see how to
1:29
rank on YouTube, Reddit, Google, AI, search engines, Plexity, Claude, all at
1:34
the same time. Even if you have zero technical skills, even if you've never done SEO before, even if you think AI is
1:41
complicated, I'm going to pull back the curtain on my own social media accounts to show you live examples of what's
1:47
working. You can see an example of a graph here. This is Julian Goldie.com. You can see we were previously at zero
1:53
clicks per day and now that has rocketed up and you can see the trajectory right there. So, I'm going to pull back the
1:59
curtain on what's working for me. By the end of this, you have a complete 30-day road map to dominate multiple search
2:05
engines with AI powered content, and I'm going to show you all the best strategies that are actually working
2:11
right now. Let's get into it. What we're going to be doing today is we are going to be running over something called the
The Goldie Multi-Engine Domination Framework
2:18
Goldie multi-engine domination framework. And this is the system that I use to rank across Google, YouTube,
2:25
Reddit, Perplexity, Claude, and pretty much every other platform that matters in 2026. And I call it the multi-engine
2:32
domination framework because that's exactly what it does. One single piece of content, multiple platforms, maximum
2:38
visibility. And here's what's happening in 2026 that nobody is talking about. Okay? Search is fragmented. People don't
Fragmented Search and Multi-Platform SEO
2:44
just use Google anymore, right? They search on YouTube, they search on Reddit, they search on Plexi, they
2:49
search on Claude. And here's the kicker, right? Google is now pulling answers from those platforms into their search
2:55
results. Reddit threads show up in Google. YouTube videos show up in Google. AI generated answers show up in
3:01
Google. So if you're only optimizing for traditional Google SEO, you're missing 70% of the opportunities out there. And
3:07
that's like basically training moto but only practicing your jab, right? You need the full arsenal. So I'm going to run through the five pillars of AI SEO
Five Pillars of AI SEO in 2026
3:14
2026 in a second, but let me show you an example. So for example, if we pull up, I don't know, an example keyword like
3:20
this, right? and we pull this up as an example. You can see here that we are ranking with multiple pieces of content
3:26
repurposed into different strategies to rank. So for example, you can see we're
3:32
ranking with our website itself. That's great. And you can see us actually ranking inside AI overviews too, right?
3:38
So for example, if we pull up the AI overviews for this keyword, you can see us ranking inside AI right here with
3:44
YouTube, right? So the YouTube video is actually ranking inside AI mode. Not only that, but we have another video
3:50
over here that's ranking from us. Another video that's ranking from LinkedIn, right? So, this video is
3:56
ranking from LinkedIn as well. And then we also have the website here as well
4:01
and Reddit. So, just to recap here, pretty much the same content but repurposed multiple times. And we are
4:08
ranking with YouTube, we are ranking with Julian Goldie.com, we're ranking with Reddit via the Goldie Agency
4:13
YouTube account, and then we are ranking with LinkedIn, right? And you can see how we're doing this. Google just finds
4:18
the details on the page it wants to rank. And that way we can dominate Google for the same keyword multiple
4:24
times to generate more traffic. For example, if you take a look on the first page of Google here, you'll see four
4:30
different videos ranking on the first page all from us, right? And so we really dominate the first page as you
4:36
can see right here. And I'm going to show you exactly how it works and how you do. You can see here as well, julian.com.
4:42
and you can pretty much get every single slot on the first page of Google if you're using the strategies I'm about to
4:47
show you. Okay, so let's get straight into it. I'm going to run through the five pillars of AI SEO in 2026. The
4:53
first pillar of this is AI SEO on YouTube. Now, YouTube is now the second largest search engine and Google
5:00
prioritizes video results. Really powerful to rank. You also got Reddit. So, Google has a direct partnership with
5:06
Reddit. So does chat GPT and Reddit threads rank for everything inside Google. Right. Pillar number three is
5:11
claw and perplexity SEO. So notebook and AI search engines are the fastest growing traffic source and they site
5:18
sources differently than Google. And then you have traditional Google SEO that's actually smarter, right? So for
5:23
example, blog content still works but only when combined with the other pillars. And finally, you have multi-platform syndications. So one
5:30
piece of content repurposed across all platforms simultaneously. So we're going to get straight into this and I'm going
5:36
to show you exactly how this works step by step. So for example here if we take a look at this particular keyword right
Case Studies and Real-World Examples
5:42
what you can see here is that we are ranking for this keyword on our website right which is great we're also ranking
5:48
for this keyword on YouTube as well right so for example if we go on to YouTube and we're like okay how to do
5:54
this we'll put this in plug it into YouTube as you can see our video is ranking right there for that particular
6:00
keyword right and we're also ranking right here so we're also creating content on our website that's ranking
6:07
inside reviews in Google, we're ranking on YouTube with multiple different accounts. If we actually go over to
6:12
Reddit and we have a look at this subreddit, as you can see, we are ranking content. And by the way, this
6:18
gets a lot of traffic in itself. So, we started this subreddit in February. And you can see over here that this is
6:23
really beginning to grow. We get 71,000 views as you can see on our Reddit subreddit as well. And actually, if we
6:29
look over the past 12 months and we see where we're up to, you can see the growth of that subreddit. Like, it's just ridiculous, right? We started at
6:36
1,700 views a month. Now went up to 6,000, 10,000. And this is repurposed content from other platforms, right? To
6:42
the point where in December we got 45,000. Now we get 70,000 views. And it really does add up. It's a super
6:48
powerful way to create content. If we look at some of the content that gets the most views. So for example, if we have a look at this one, all it is is a
6:54
repurposed piece of content, right? So you can see this is linking to our YouTube channel, right? And this is
7:01
basically a repurposed piece of content. Ranks on Reddit, ranks inside Google.
7:06
And it was quite simple and easy to build this out. You can actually take the transcript and then plug it through Claude, for example. As the old belief
Breaking SEO Myths and New Beliefs
7:11
was, for example, like some people would say SEO takes 6 to 12 months to see results. And I want to just break some
7:17
of the limited beliefs that holding you back. This is a wrong belief in itself because here's why the old belief is
7:22
wrong, right? When you only do Google SEO, yes, it takes forever. But when you stack YouTube, Reddit, AI citations, and
7:28
Google together, each platform feeds the others, right? So your YouTube video gets embedded in your blog post. Your
7:34
blog post gets discussed on Reddit. Your Reddit thread ranks on Google. And Google sees all this activity and boosts
7:39
basically everything. I've seen brand new sites hit page one in 30 days or 47 days of using this approach. And it's
7:45
like compound interest, but for rankings. And the maths changes when you multiply platforms because if you only
7:50
train, for example, one discipline, you improve slowly. If you train, for example, multiple approaches together,
7:55
each skill reinforces the other and you level up like five faster. And again, let's just go back to that search and
8:01
we'll see what we're doing. So, if we have a look at this, not only are we ranking, but we're ranking extremely quickly. So, if you look at this video,
8:07
we actually published it today and that was only 6 hours ago and you can already see it ranking on the first page of
8:12
Google, right? And so, this content ranks extremely quickly. This one 3 days ago was published. It's ranking on the
8:19
first page of Google, but it's also ranking inside the AIO overview as you can see right here, right? As you can
8:24
rank content really quickly with AI SEO if you're doing the right things. Now, one thing I want to tell you here, and
8:30
this might blow your mind as well. Some people think you need to be an expert. My team does it. And I've actually taken
8:35
a bunch of virtual assistants, given them my systems, they've never done SEO before, and they're getting better
8:41
results than like 99% of SEOs, as you can see right here. It's pretty insane, right? Who's ranking three times inside
8:46
AO views? is just ridiculous, right? On three different platforms, Julian golden.com, Reddit, and also LinkedIn.
8:53
People say, "Well, I need to be technical to do AI SEO." The new belief really is that AI handles the technical stuff so you can focus on the strategy,
8:59
right? I talk to website owners all the time who think they need to learn Python, understand it to do SEO. Claude, Gemini, chat, GPT, they can write your
9:06
technical SEO for you. They can generate schema markup. They can analyze your competitors. They can write optimized
9:11
content. Right? Your job is really to be the strategist, not the technician. So I run a 50 person agency and guess what?
9:18
Most of my team uses AI skills to do the technical work and the humans provide the strategy and quality control. So you
9:24
don't need to be a coder, you need to be a thinker. That's the main thing here. And people will say AI search engines
9:29
like Plexi, aren't they going to destroy traffic? And the main thing to note here is that AI search engines are a new
9:35
traffic source you can optimize for. And this is probably the biggest mindset shift for 2026. People think perplexity
9:41
and claw the competition. They're not the new distribution channels, right? When someone asks Claude or Plexi a question, those AI model site sources
9:49
and your content can be that source. Okay. I've tracked referral traffic from AI search engines and it's grown
9:54
massively this year. And the people coming from AI search are also more qualified because they've asked a
9:59
specific question and the AI sent them to you as the answer. So, it's like having a robot recommend your business
10:06
to everyone ask. And that is a power move in itself. Right. So, we've broken through some of the limiting beliefs. We've talked about the framework and how
10:12
to optimize it. I've shown you proof that actually works. What I want to leave you with is a 30-day action plan
30-Day Action Plan for Multi-Engine Domination
10:18
to implement the multi-engine domination, right? And this is your day-by-day road for ranking across
10:23
multiple platforms. And basically what this road map does is each day it gives you a prompt, it gives you the actions,
10:29
gives you the homework, and then if you want to start ranking your website with AI SEO, you can follow the prompts and
10:35
the implementation plan right here and just step by step master it for your website and your brand. Right? So that's
10:41
basically how it works. And you might be wondering, okay, does this work for everyone? Blah blah blah. You can see
10:46
some of our wins. So a lot of people inside the AI profit border are doing AI SEO. And you can see all these wins that
10:51
we're getting through here, right here, from happy clients inside the air profit border. Let me show you something else as well. So for example, here you can
10:58
see that we actually have 109 pages of people winning with AI. So it's not just me. We teach the systems inside the AR
11:05
profit border that make this achievable and we break it down into step-by-step systems that my team is using as well.
11:11
So if you want all the same systems, you can get that inside the AR profitable border. But yeah, this is how it works.
11:16
This is what people are doing and what people should be doing. Now let's talk about the old way versus the new way with SEO. Most businesses are doing SEO
Old SEO vs. New SEO Strategies
11:23
by writing blog posts and hoping Google finds them. Building backlinks from random directories, ignoring YouTube because video is harder. thinking Reddit
11:30
is just for memes, pretending AI search engines don't exist, waiting 6 to 12 months for any results, using the same
11:36
strategies from 5 years ago, focusing on only one platform, creating content and then forgetting about it, and manually
11:41
repurposing everything if at all. Whereas, if you use the multi-engine domination framework that I've shown you
11:47
today, you can create content designed for multiple platforms from day one. You can build authority across Google, YouTube, Reddit, AI search, and many
11:53
other platforms. You can use AI to repurpose one piece of content in 10 formats. A lot of people come to me and
11:58
they're like, Julian, I see you everywhere. Like literally everywhere. Like, how do you do it? And the systems
12:04
that we use are inside the AI profit boarding. Thanks so much for watching. If you want to get all the free notes from today, the belief breakers, if you

13:15
0 to 170 clicks per day with AI SEO. That's what's happened to my agency's
13:21
website as you can see right here. And today I'm going to break it down for you. So I'm going to show you what's
13:27
happened to my agency's website using a simple AI SEO system. No expensive tools, no complicated software, no
13:34
waiting for results with SEO. Just cla some free keyword research and a link building strategy that actually works.
13:41
As you can see, this website was getting like literally zero clicks back here and now it is getting up to 176. You see the
13:49
trajectory it's on is going up pretty nicely right there. Here's the thing that people get wrong about SEO. They
13:54
think you need to be technical. They think you need fancy software and they think it takes forever. Wrong and wrong
14:00
again. Today I'm going to pull back the curtain and show you exactly how I did this. You're going to see the exact keywords to targeted the exact prompts,
14:07
the exact link building approach that moved the needle. And the best part is you can do this even if you've never
14:12
done SEO before. Even if you've tried SEO and failed, even if you think AI is confusing. I'm going to walk you through
14:18
the whole thing step by step and by the end of this video, you'll have a complete free 30-day system you can copy
14:25
and paste into your own business if you want to. All right, so we're going to get straight into this. We're going to be using something called the Goldie
14:32
Accelerator Framework as you can see right here. If you've never seen this group before, this is a free success lab
14:39
and it's going to run you through all the notes from today. Actually connects you with 42,700 entrepreneurs interested
14:45
in AI. And if you go to the classroom here and then you go down to AI SEO,
14:50
you'll see all the video notes from today with all the links, resources, 30-day plan, etc. Right? Completely free. Link in the comments description.
14:56
So, the Goldie AI SEO framework. Let's run you through. This is the exact system I used to take my agency from 0
15:04
to 176 clicks a day. And I call it the Goldie AI SEO accelerator because it combines three things. Claude AI for
15:10
content creation, low competition keyword research, and strategic link building. So when you put these three
15:16
things together, something magical actually happens. You stop fighting for impossible keywords. You start ranking
15:21
fast and you build momentum that compounds over time, right? It's how I approach Muay Thai training. For
15:26
example, I don't try and knock someone out in the first round. You set things up, you find the openings, you land strategic strikes that add up. And it's
15:33
the same with SEO, right? So let me break down exactly what happened with my agency website. So if we look at where
15:38
we're at right now, you can see previously we're at like zero. And we started publishing around about here.
15:44
It's the end of September last year that we started publishing a lot of content to this website. And pretty much every
15:49
single video that I created, I would turn into a blog post. So, I'm going to test this out. Are you on again, my
Live Q&A and Community Engagement
15:56
friend? Good to see you. You're making me laugh, man. If someone is watching, they're not sure what's going on. So,
16:02
I've done three, this is my third live stream today. I do one for AI, I do one for making money, and I do one for AI
16:07
tools in general, and then I publish the videos. And Wilty says, "When do you sleep? I've been too long. It's 6:00 a.m. here and haven't been sleep yet.
16:14
Though I may not last through the whole I appreciate you watching either way, man. What a legend. She has made every single live stream today. So I
16:20
appreciate that, man. Like what dedication. So basically what I'm going to break down today is my exact process
16:26
for doing this. So where do we get started? If we have a look at this website, we'll analyze and break down what we're doing here. So if we look at
16:33
this website for example, right? This is my agency website. The goal here is to drive people to the SEO strategy session
16:39
or to get them to order SEO online. And so like you don't need a lot of traffic to actually monetize this website and
16:45
when we actually do generate traffic to it. If you have a look for example log into here and we'll check out what we're
16:50
doing. But essentially we've built a lot of backlinks to this website a lot of them natural and a lot of them actually
16:56
coming through to the site and HFS is way behind on the organic traffic as you already know. But if we have a look
17:01
here, the main thing to note here out of all this dashboard is that you've got a DR a domain rating of 55. So it's a
17:08
pretty powerful website, right? So we're going to get back to this now. I'm going to have a look at what sort of backlinks you've built. All right. So if we look
17:14
at let's say for example, we're only going to look at one link per domain and then we only want to look at do follow. Right? This is how you can quickly
17:20
filter down the back profile and just find decent stuff. And what you can see here if we look through the website for
17:26
example is like we're getting pages from for example like trafficthinktank.com and this is a domain rating 70. Now one
17:32
of the craziest things about this is like we haven't actually done any outreach to this website. They've just linked to us naturally from
17:38
trafficthinktank.com and you can see us listed as one of the top seven books in SEO right there. Look
17:45
at that. I didn't even know I was on this list. And so we're getting a lot of backlinks naturally because we do so much personal branding. And then what we
17:50
also do is we do some outreach as well. In fact, I don't think we do much outreach anymore, but we used to do a lot of outreach and that's what we do
17:56
for a lot of our clients as well. Inspired Michelle. Oh, Jason says, "Is this live?" It is live, Jason. McKay,
18:02
thanks very much for joining. Good to see here. And then Inspired Michelle says, "Are you driving to to the website
18:07
or a landing page lately?" People say driving to the landing page, not web. And do you have a video that explains what backlinks really are? Sorry, I'm a
18:14
rookie. All right, cool. So, a lot to break down there. Yeah, if you actually go on YouTube, like we've got tons of training on link building. So if you
18:20
type into link building for example, you'll see all my trainings link building. If you actually do you know what if you DM me inside the AI success
18:28
lab and anyone watching if you DM me inside AI success lab I'll just give you a free copy of my book just to help you.
18:34
But yeah that's basically it and then if you want some videos just have a look at my videos on the website but yeah essentially that's what it is. Backlinks
18:39
are kind of like boats from other websites say your content is good. The more backlinks you get the more likely you are to rank. Now where do we drive
18:45
the backlinks to? We drive oh wilty says hit the like button subscribe. That's what we're talking about. Thank you,
18:50
Wily. You're on fire today, man. Appreciate it. And you can see here, basically, we're driving back links to
18:55
inner pages on our site, right? So, for example, here we've got back from this site and it points to this site over here, right? And basically, we're just
19:02
pointing to inner pages. So, it's a mix of like homepage link, inner page links, landing page links, etc. So, not really
19:09
linking anywhere specific, but you can see that's helped the traffic a lot and that makes it much easier to rank because the more backlinks you have, the
19:14
more authority you have, the more likely you are to rank. If we have a look here, really what changed everything? We stopped targeting impossible keywords
19:20
everyone fights over. We started using claw to find gaps. We built real backlings from the websites as you've seen today already. And then you can see
19:27
here that we've created content that actually answers what people search for despite Michelle says will do. Awesome.
19:33
If we have a look for example at this website and what we're doing here, we're going after like really niche keywords
19:38
like really easy stuff to rank for that most people wouldn't. So for example, if you look at this, who is trying to rank
19:44
for that keyword, right? But people are searching on Google and it does have search volume, right? But you can see here, for example, if we type in this on
19:50
Google, we're going to rank in one way or another. So for example, you can see we're ranking with our videos for this particular keyword. How do we drive
19:57
better rankings for our videos? One of the methods we do is like we do embed these websites with our videos and that helps rank them as well. That helps
20:03
drive more traffic to them. And then for example, between the keyword research, the content, and everything else that
20:09
we're doing, we just have a much higher chance of ranking. Right? For example, here if we look at this keyword, let's
20:14
have a look here. You can see us ranking on the first page of Google with two different channels from YouTube as you
20:19
can see, right? And then if we actually scroll down, you can see that AIO views is sourcing us and our content for this
20:25
particular keyword, right? So, we're going after like really niche stuff, like really low competition stuff. I don't think many people are trying to
20:30
rank for that keyword, although I can see a few YouTube videos trying to do it. But you can see here, for example, our page ranks number one, and then we
20:36
have another page ranking number two, right? And so if you have a look at this keyword as well, this page will ranking
20:42
twice inside AI views for that particular keyword as well as with our video here and our video here. Okay? And
20:48
so we can rank four times on the first page of Google. Pretty simple. And also we've got another page ranking right here. And bear in mind like this page
20:54
was only created 20 hours ago. If you have a look at that and then we've got another page that's ranking for that particular keyword. We just posted the
21:00
caption plus a video and boom, it started ranking on Google. So there's many different ways. I think even this
21:05
is one of our Reddit threads as well. Look at that. It's crazy this stuff, right? One of the things that we do is we actually publish across multiple
21:11
platforms using the content from our videos and then we rank it multiple times. So we don't just get traffic to our website, we also get traffic to our
21:17
videos from Google and we also get traffic to our Reddit and our LinkedIn as you can see. So that's basically how
21:23
it works. That's the whole process. Now some people going to say SEO takes years to see results. The new belief and I
21:29
think this is a much more power empowering belief which is that low competition keywords can rank in weeks. And here's what nobody tells you about
21:35
SEO, right? So, for example, the people who say it takes years are targeting keywords they have no business
21:40
targeting, right? It's like a white belt walking into a Muay Thai gym and trying to fight professional. Of course, you're going to lose, right? But what if you
21:46
fought other white belts? That's what low competition keywords are. They're winnable fights. And when I started
21:51
focusing on keywords, the big competitors ignored, I started seeing rankings within weeks, not months, not
21:56
years, weeks. Right? So, the game isn't about being the biggest, it's about being strategic. And that is what we are
22:02
doing with our content, with our backlink strategy and by posting across multiple platforms as well. Says,
22:08
"Julian, explain a little bit more about your 24hour free offer that you listed. Not sure what that is. If you mean this
22:14
one for the AR profit border, this one right here." So, basically, you can see everything that's broken down, but if you're not sure about something in the
22:20
offer, feel free to ask me. But basically, you get all of this stuff and this if you join the AR profit border,
22:26
you can see the numbers break down right here. Plus, if you sign up annually, you get all this stuff. So, yeah, there you go. And then Jason McKay says, "I used
22:32
to get loads of traffic to my Etsy store and then and eBay and 150 orders a day.
22:37
Last couple of years has gone to us and I don't know why it seems like if you're not spending I mean like you can rank organically but the way that we do it is
22:44
we don't just rank with one platform, right? Because this is what happens. So for example, if you're creating content just on your website and then you know
22:51
something happens, Google changed its algorithm or whatever the problem with that. The biggest issue with that is like you lose all your traffic
22:57
overnight. Whereas if our website got clapped and let's say for example Google decided we don't like Julian's website. We're going to mark him down. Right? No
23:04
problem because we got two YouTube channels ranking on first page Google and then we've also got our website ranking right here. We've got LinkedIn
23:10
and we've got Reddit, right? And so in multiple different ways from multiple different angles and multiple different
23:16
platforms, we're ranking our content and so you become like unstoppable. And that's the way that I like to look at AI
23:21
SEO. That's one of the things that we're doing with this as well, but I'll come on to that later. Some people think you need to be technical to do SEO.
23:26
Actually, Claude AI handles all the technical stuff for you, right? And I'll show you how we do this. And it's super simple. When it comes to creating the
23:32
content, I actually have a team that have never done SEO before and they get results better than 99% SEOs. Why is
23:39
that? It's because they're using the systems that I've set up for them. What are the systems that we've set up? Let
23:45
me show you. So, basically what they do is they take a piece of content like this one, right? Then they take the transcript from the video like this,
23:52
right? And then they take the transcript like you see here. And all they do is they go up to Claude, they paste that
23:57
in, they take a prompt like this as you can see. So they take this prompt, they
24:02
plug it into Claude and then they put the keyword here. So let's say for example the keyword for this was like
24:08
notebook in Gemini, right? Notebook Gemini AI, right? They would just plug it in like you see here and that would
24:14
automate the content, right? And that's pretty much how we are generating the content for the website. Now, obviously,
24:20
we proofread it, we check it, we have a checklist to make sure everything is working properly, but essentially that's
24:25
how easy it is to create content that actually ranks. And all you need to do is find the keywords. Now, how do you
24:30
find the keywords? We're going after trending stuff, right? So, we're going after stuff that is pretty much brand new. Like notebook, it literally just
24:37
got released last year. All these updates that are coming out are like brand new, right? Literally within 24 hours, we talk about an update, right?
24:43
And so what you can do, I tend to find this actually works better than HS is you can go into Google here and you can
24:49
just go on the autosuggest. And the reason that I recommend finding keywords from autosuggest is that you won't find
24:55
the accurate level of search volume for these keywords if you just go into hrefs, right? So it's much better to go
25:01
into autosuggest. And also the cool thing about that is when your team are doing research, you don't need to pay for any tools, right? It's free to do
25:08
the keyword research and that sort of thing. So yeah, it's pretty simple and easy. Now Jason says, "Can you use Gemini as a subscription for that as a
25:15
fine subscription to all these AI?" Yeah, honestly, like if I had a choice between subscribing to Gemini and Claude, I'd probably go with Claw to be
25:21
honest cuz I think the content is way way better. But if you took the exact same prompt like you can see here and then you went into Gemini, the content
25:27
won't feel as humanized and sentient, but you can still use the same prompt and go into Gemini and as long as you're
25:33
not like an absolutionist with your content, you can still generate content that actually ranks using this method.
25:39
So yeah, it works really well. Uh, inspired. Michelle says, "What is this GEO? Is that just a new word for SEO?"
25:46
Yeah, that's basically the same thing, right? So, GEO is just a form of ranking inside AI. Nothing has really changed
25:52
about SEO, right? So, for example, if you have a look here and we went into and we were like, okay, notebook, LM,
25:57
make money, something like that, right? And you were looking inside there, I can actually see that my website here, here,
26:03
where else, and here are all ranking cyberplexi as well. And so I know like for this keyword for example like I can
26:09
rank my content inside there like eight times, right? And I actually find it's easier now to create more content across
26:14
more platforms which gives you more opportunities to rank inside AI search engines as well as and that's just what
26:19
we're doing. You can see our pages ranking right there. No one else will show you this stuff by the way. No, everyone is too scared to show you stuff
26:25
like this because they're scared of getting clapped or whatever. But I just want to share this stuff with you. And you can see here, for example, we've got
26:30
a LinkedIn page ranking right there. We've got a website ranking inside Perplexity. We've got another website, a
26:35
different website ranking in Cyplexity. How are we doing it? We're just doing exactly what I showed you. Ashton says,
26:41
"Tip of the morning, bro. Loving the content. Thank you very much to wake up and provide free guidance. Always happy
26:46
to help. It is a pleasure, Ashton. Thanks for joining again." But yeah, this is basically how it goes. So, if you want to use Gemini, you can see here
26:52
that you can generate the content with Gemini as well. Honestly, it's not bad, right? It's not that bad. It's going to be better than chat anyway. And you can
26:59
see here, for example, it's created this content and the content feels fairly humanized, right? you would just edit it
27:04
before you publish it. But if you don't want to use Claude, then you can use Gemini, no issue, right? No, no problem
27:10
at all. And so that's basically how we're getting results with it. The other thing that I'm going to say is some people say all the good keywords are
27:15
taken, right? But the new belief really is like keywords appear every single day. New keywords appear every single
27:20
day. Think about this, right? AI didn't exist as a mainstream topic 3 years ago. Now there are millions of searches
27:27
around it. New industries pop up. New problems emerge. New solutions get created. So every single day there are
27:32
fresh keywords with zero competition because nobody has written them about. No one has written about them yet. And
27:37
so you can use Claude or you can use Google for this and it's like having a scout that never sleeps, right? Other
27:42
people say link building is spammy and risky. Really the new belief here, the empowering belief is like strategic
27:48
outreach builds real relationships and real rankings, right? Good link building is just networking. Think about this, right? When I speak at events like
27:54
Vietnam SEO mastery, I did Changai SEO, I meet people, we exchange ideas, sometimes we collaborate. That is link
28:00
building except you do it online, right? So you reach out to real websites, you offer real value, they link to you because it helps their readers. No spam,
28:06
no tricks, no risk, right? And so my team of 50 people or the agency does this every single day and we've never
28:11
had a penalty, right? This is the methods we use. I've shown you exactly how to implement this. I've talked about the keywords, content, and backling
28:17
strategy that we've used and I want to give you a 30-day plan for actually implementing it. This is exactly what to do from day one to day 30 to start
28:24
getting results. And I've shown you all the proof that this actually works ranking inside Plexity and also ranking
28:29
inside Google like what multiple times, sometimes 10 times on the first page of Google for the same keyword. And so
28:34
we've got a 30-day plan here that you can actually copy and steal from me if you'd like to. And this is exactly how
28:42
we get results like you can see. And so just to recap what we've done, we've given you all the resources, right, for
28:47
using this. I've shown you proof it actually works as you can see right here. We have talked you through the
28:52
Goldie AI SEO accelerator framework, right? So, Called AI for content creation, low competition keyword
28:58
research, and strategic link building. I've walked through some of the beliefs that might be holding you back from getting results with SEO because
29:04
sometimes it's not a skill set problem, it's a belief problem. And sometimes when you make those belief changes, your
29:09
skill set suddenly changes as well. And then I've also given you a 30-day AI accelerator plan so you can get results
29:15
with this stuff. And these have prompts that you can implement every single day to get results with this stuff. All right. Now, the final thing that I want
29:21
to say as well is that we've actually created a list of 100 AI SEO prompts
29:27
that you can get for pretty much every element of AI, right? Inspire Michelle says, "Is it just worth it to use Gemini
29:32
or Claude and do it myself?" Yeah. So, I would recommend that you actually use Claude if you can. Claude is by far the
29:38
best. It creates better content than I can write to put it in perspective. And I've been doing copyrightiting for about 10 years. So, I would definitely
29:44
recommend going with Claude if you can. If you want to use Gemini, that is totally fine. And Jason says, "I find that when I'm subscribing to something
29:50
like you have, it becomes overwhelming as there's many videos you seem to get dragged all over the place. How do I resolve that?" So, if you're in the AR
29:57
profit boardroom, there's two ways you can resolve that. Number one, inside the AR profit boardroom here, we actually
30:02
have a focus protocol, right? So, if you go to the start here post inside the AI
30:08
profit boardroom, this is designed to remove overwhelm. So, for example, you can see here we have the feeling
30:15
overwhelmed section inside the AI profit boardroom. This is my AI automation community and you follow this and you
30:20
will never worry about overwhelm again. Right? So if you feel overwhelmed, if you want to cut out the noise, if you
30:26
want something the step by step with a sixeek course, use the link above. It's a drip feed week by week so you don't
30:33
get overwhelmed, right? And this way everything is actionable. Okay? And if you're still overwhelmed, use the Julian
30:38
Goldie Ultimate Focus manual. And this manual will help you just avoid overwhelm and avoid all the problems
30:44
that come with AI. And then the other thing that we do to just cut out the noise and help you save time is that we have weekly updates inside the air
30:50
profitable board. And all you need to do is check that once a week. Like you can turn off all your notifications. You don't need to check YouTube. You don't
30:56
need to check Twitter. Just check out the weekly updates inside the AR profitable. And that's two ways that you
31:02
can cut out overwhelm. So just to be clear here and we've actually got a link right here inside the AI profitable to the focus manual if you're feeling over
31:09
because it's something that everyone in AI feels. So yeah, hope that helps Jason. So, thanks so much for watching.
31:14
I've given you access to all the frameworks from today inside the AI success lab link in the comments
31:20
description. This connects you with 42,700 people. As you can see, if you go to the classroom here, and then you go
31:27
to the AI SEO section, you can get all the video notes from today. And then, additionally, you get all the links, you
31:33
get the full guide on the framework, you get 100 prompts, all the limiting beliefs to break through, and then also
31:39
a 30-day plan for really implementing that. So yeah, feel free to get that. Michelle and Jason, I hope that you're
31:46
in the AR profit boardroom and that you've used the focus manual. If you haven't, check it out. If you can't find
31:51
it, DM me. And then just turn off all your notifications. Don't check YouTube. Don't check Twitter. Don't check any
31:56
other social media and follow the plan inside the focus protocol. And then just check my weekly updates once a week and you're good to go. So thanks so much for
32:03
watching. Appreciate as always and I'll see you on the next one. Cheers. And inspire Michelle says, "Thanks. I'd wake
32:09
up for your lives. I learned so much and don't feel stupid when I ask questions. Always happy to help. No, there's no
32:14
stupid questions. Every question is good. It's one of those when you're ready to come, we're ready for you. So feel free. So that's it. So one of my
Notebook LM and Gemini for Content Creation
32:21
favorite ways to create SEO content and content in general is Notebook 11. And one of the best things about this is
32:27
it's a very powerful tool for generating content across multiple platforms. You can generate videos, podcasts that rank,
32:33
you can create blog posts, etc. And it's all automated based on your unique sources which creates unique content
32:40
because it's generating content across multiple platforms. So you can see for example here we can go into the report
32:47
section and then we can type in blog post and that will generate the report. Now one of the great things about generating content with Gemini for
32:54
example and notebook is you can easily automate this content and then also when
32:59
you're doing this it's powered by Gemini but the difference is that is a free tool to generate and then you can for
33:05
example like create videos like this these are faceless animated videos animated by AI and they automate the
33:11
content itself. So for example, this has taken my audio content. It's taken the sources that we've loaded in here and
33:17
then created a full video on how to handle objections. Let's play this back now. So these are like videos that
33:24
actually break down the sources you've loaded into Notebook LM. And then you can use that for SEO content, whether
33:29
that's videos on YouTube that will rank or for example blog posts that will rank on your website. It could be social
33:34
media posts that rank directly on Google. But the main thing here is that you can create content with notebookm
33:40
automate it and then post it across multiple platforms. Right? So for example here we've got this article and
33:46
this video that's been posted. Now the cool thing about this is if you have a look for example we've got this video on
33:52
YouTube and this ranks for targeted keyword. So you can see here we've got the keyword directly on Google and the
33:58
number one ranking video is our article right here. Right? Our video that we've automated with AI. If we actually go
34:04
over to the video, this is fully AI generated video just like you can do with notebook 11 completely faceless and
34:10
it's got an AI generated voice over that narrates it and then sends traffic to our funnels. Right? So for example, if
34:16
we play this back and so you can easily create these videos, automate them with you can do that for free based on the
34:22
keyword you want to rank for and then you can post them on YouTube and they rank directly on Google like you can see right here. The other cool thing is they
34:28
actually rank directly inside YouTube. So when people search for them, they find your content. So for example, this
34:34
particular video that we just automated in one click for our target keyword already got 356 views, right, on YouTube
34:41
directly. Plus, it sends traffic directly to our SEO elite circle page, which then upsells them in a funnel,
34:46
right? Pretty powerful. And the crazy thing about this is not even a good AI video, right? The ones from Notebook LM
34:53
directly are much better. This was just like an old faceless version that we created for fun, right? And the other
34:59
cool thing is here you can actually repurpose that content from notebook, right? So for example, let's say you've
35:05
got notebook over here. You can then go and create a blog post. So you can see
35:10
we've got a blog post here. You can target your keyword inside that blog post, post it to your website, as you
35:16
can see we've done on this particular page, and then you funnel traffic and you get two slots for the same amount of
35:22
work, both automated with Notebook LM. Now, of course, this all depends on the
35:27
quality of the sources you load into notebook, but you can see how easy it is to automate videos, to automate blog
35:33
posts, to load in your own sources, and then create the content however you want. Now, if you actually go to the
35:40
reports and then blog post section, before you actually create the content, make sure you include prompts on exactly
35:46
how you want the content written. And that way when you publish your content, when you create the blog post and you
35:51
post it on your website, it's written in a way that you're happy with. Plus, you can actually embed the AI generated
35:58
video that's faceless inside the article itself. As you can see, that will help your article rank, but it also help your
36:04
video rank. And so, they both help each other. And then underneath the video, you can funnel traffic to your funnels
36:10
and your sales pages and your landing pages like you can see we have done right there. Right? And so, you've seen
36:15
proof this method works. You've seen exactly how to do it for free with notebookm and you've seen how we're
36:20
ranking number one here and also ranking second here and we're also ranking directly with our website
36:26
julianold.co.uk and our LinkedIn post as you can see here. So it's a really easy and powerful process. You can also see
36:32
we've got another post here from LinkedIn that's ranking and that's just another video ranking. It's pretty
36:38
crazy, right? And so you can use this process to just rank multiple times on Google, dominate the first page, create
36:43
quality content, and then publish and rank, right, for whatever keyword you want to target. Now, I would recommend that you go after easy keywords. So, for
36:50
example, SEO training Devon, pretty easy keyword. SEO training Honington, great keyword as well, but it's so easy to
36:55
rank for it. And also, the cool thing about this is you just you can quality check it before you publish it, right?
37:01
So, you wouldn't just go straight from notebook LM and publish it straight to your website. What you actually want to
37:06
do instead is use a checklist. Let me find an SEO checklist for you here. There we go. All right. So, you can use
37:12
a checklist like this to just improve it step by step. I actually have a full video tutorial on Google which breaks
37:18
down the full SEO checklist as you can see. And a lot of people like that checklist. So, if you want to steal that
37:23
checklist from me, you can. It's directly on YouTube. And you can also get a step-by-step breakdown of exactly
37:29
how to implement this, right? And this just makes sure that your content is good before you actually publish it, right? and answers all the FAQs you
37:35
would have about SEO too. So that is basically the notebook and Gemini AI SEO
37:41
process. Inside the video notes from today inside the AI success lab, I've included resources. I've broken down the
37:47
framework. So the Goldie content intelligence system and this is a step-by-step framework that I've shown you today for Notebook LM and Gemini.
37:54
And this basically turns Google's free AI tools into your personal SEO team. So that notebook LM becomes your research
38:00
brain and is powered by Gemini. So Gemini becomes your content engine and together they can create content that
38:07
ranks as you've seen today already. Now some people say AI content doesn't rank on Google. I've already shown you it
38:12
does. As you can see right here, we're ranking with AI content here and here and also there and also there, right? So
38:18
we're ranking five times with AI content. So the new empowering belief really is like AI content guided by real
38:25
research dominates search results, right? Because we're dominating that search result as you can see today. And so here's the truth. Like Google doesn't
38:31
hate AI content, it just hates bad content. So when you feed notebookm actual competitive pages and real
38:36
ranking articles, it learns what works and then Gemini creates content based on what's already winning, right? And it's
38:42
not guessing. So it's basically reverse engineering the success when I run an SEO agency with over 50 team members. We
38:48
test this sort of stuff every single day across all our websites and the content that ranks is the content that actually
38:53
answers what people are searching for. Notebook and finds the answer. Gemini writes it and there's a very simple system that works, right? Other people
39:00
will say you need to be an SEO expert to rank on Google. All you need really I've spoken at SEO conferences all over the
39:05
world. Vietnam SEO Mastery, Changai SEO. I've seen every level of SEO knowledge. And the crazy thing about this is the
39:12
people who win are not always the smartest. They are the ones with the best systems. So Notebook Plus Gemini is
39:18
that system. It does a keyword research for you. It does the competitor analysis for you. It can do the content restructuring for you. And you just
39:24
follow the steps. All right, that's basically how the whole process works. So, what I've actually done is broken down this into a 30-day content
39:31
intelligence plan with the research as the foundation for keywords and loading up notebook with good sources. Then from
39:37
there, we've got the content creation. And you've got prompts and homework for every single step of the process for the 30-day plan. And if you want to steal
39:44
this stuff from me, you can get it all inside the AI success lab. But the main thing to note here is the old way was
39:49
spending hours manually reading competitor articles. The new way is like you can upload 10 articles to notebook
39:54
and ask for a summary in 30 seconds. The old way was paying for expensive keyword research tools. The new way is you can
39:59
use free Google tools plus Gemini for better insights. If you want to do some quick research for SEO, you can just
40:06
type in the keyword that you want to rank for and then look at the different free auto suggestions you get from
40:11
Google. And this is Google's data telling you what people are searching for. Right? The old way was like guessing what content format to use. The
40:17
new way is notebookm analyzes search results and tell you exactly what format ranks. The old way is writing content
40:22
and then researching. The new way is researching first and then writing content that matches what Google wants. This is basically the whole process, how
40:29
it works, etc. You've got a 30-day plan. I've also included 100 prompts you can use for notebook LM and Gemini. So, for
40:35
example, the research prompts, the keyword research prompts, the content outline prompts, etc. It's all inside
40:41
the video notes from today, which are completely free. All right? Along with an extra video tutorial on exactly how
40:46
to do this stuff. So, you can get this all inside the AI success lab in the comments and the description. And if you
40:52
want to get a community with 43,300 members, plus all my best trainings on
40:57
AI SEO, plus the framework, the 30-day plan, and all the prompts from today, you can get that inside the AI success

Introduction and Link Building Overview
42:02
know, you don't need to send 1,000 cold emails to get ignored. You don't need to buy sketchy links to get penalties. You
42:08
don't need to spend months waiting for results. As you can see today, I'm going to show you the exact backlink profile
42:13
we built for Julian Goldie.com that took us from zero clicks, as you can see over
42:18
here, to this trajectory where we now get 108 free clicks and we also rank multiple times inside AI search engines
42:25
and inside Google as well. And I'm going to break down the whole process and framework for you. So, you're going to
42:30
learn the exact backlink profile we built for this website. How we're using AI to find link building opportunities
42:36
in minutes instead of weeks. New 2026 link building strategies that working right now. How to build authority
42:41
backlinks even if you're brand new. The backlink method that gets websites linking to you without cold outreach.
42:47
Live demonstrations. And my complete 30-day link building plan with AI automation every step. Plus 100 prompts
42:54
you can steal and use today. And I've used this system to help over 1,000 businesses rank number one on Google. My
43:01
team of 50 people, my SEO agency builds links like this every single day. So I'm going to show you everything. and we'll
43:06
get straight into it. So, the strategy that we're going to be using today is called the backlink dominance engine,
Backlink Dominance Engine Strategy
43:12
right? And this is essentially a 30-day plan for ranking number one with strategic link building. So, what link
43:18
building actually is. So, think of Google like a popularity contest. All right? So, for example, if we have a
43:24
look, we're ranking like this. If we actually go on Google and we just type in some random keywords like for example, I don't know like this, right?
43:31
And you'll find us ranking inside the AI search engine here and here as you can see and also multiple times on the first
43:36
page of Google and also with our website down here and LinkedIn as well. Right?
43:41
So we're dominating that page for that keyword. And the way that you want to think about this is that Google is kind of like a popularity contest. All right?
43:48
And every website is a person at a party. So backlinks equals other people pointing at you and saying that person
43:54
is worth talking to. Okay? And the more respected people pointing at you, the more Google trusts you, the higher your ranking. It's as simple as that. So, for
44:01
example, if we look at julianold.com, it's built hundreds of backlinks over time as you can see. And if we take a
44:07
look at this site, we break this down. We're going to run through like the newest backlinks. And we'll go for do follow only. You can see here that we're
44:13
generating backlinks all the time for this website, right? So, I'll come back to how we do that in a minute, but each
44:18
one acts like a vote of confidence until you get results like this. And when you look at the backlink profile, you'll see
44:24
links from high authority news sites, industry relevant blogs, guest posts, digital PR placements, resource page
44:30
links, and this is really what separates those that rank number one from sites stuck on page five. Okay, so we're going
44:36
to get straight into this, but before we get into it, some people going to say link building is spammy will get me penalized. The new empowering belief
44:42
really is like strategic link building is hell. Every major brand dominates Google. For example, let me let me show
44:49
you an example right here. So here's what I learned living in Bangkok. So every morning I'd walk to the Muay Thai
44:54
gym and there's this old Thai trainer there. It's called Coach Jack, right? He's about 60 years old. He's still sharp. He's still teaching. And one day
45:01
I asked him like, "How do you have so much energy?" He actually smiled and said, "I only do the techniques that work. I stopped doing everything else 40
45:07
years ago." And that kind of hit me hard cuz link building is the same. The spammy stuff, that's the flashy techniques that get people penalized.
45:13
The strategic stuff, that's the fundamentals to win championships, right? Google doesn't penalize link building. Google penalizes bad link
45:19
building. And every Fortune 500 company has a link building strategy. Every site ranking number one has backlinks. The
45:26
question isn't whether to build backlinks. The question is whether to build the right. So if we take a look
45:31
for example here, you can see that we're getting back links naturally from other relevant websites. Right? If we filter down to one link per domain for example,
45:38
you can see us getting back links from articles like this for example, right? Highly relevant articles. So this
45:44
website is talking about AI. We talk a lot about AI on a website. They link to us. Makes sense, right? And we get these back links naturally to our site. You
45:50
can see a bunch of others right here. The repurposing blog posts for example. We've got a link from this site to
45:55
another site that we own, right? And we're generating these back links. As you can see, here's one about perplexity. And then it links to our
46:02
article about Plexity. These are natural relevant backlinks and we're just attracting those back links through the content creation that we do. And some
46:08
people think I need thousands of backlinks to rank. But the new empowering belief really is like 10 perfect backlinks beats a thousand
Quality Over Quantity in Link Building
46:15
garbage ones. I track every single minute of my time, right? The day, the task, the minutes worked. And why is
46:21
that? Is because I learned that volume about quality is just noise. And it's the same with banks, right? Julianolder.com, it doesn't have the
46:26
most backlinks in the SEO space. But we rank for competitive keywords. How is that? We focus on quality over quantity
46:32
every single time. So, one link from a DR70 site in your niche is like more powerful than like 500 random directory
46:40
websites. One guest post on a real blog with real readers is like a thousand spammy forums. In fact, that's going to
46:46
do more harm than good. You just wouldn't want that at all. And so, just stop chasing volume when it comes to link building and start chasing
46:52
relevance instead. So, this is basically what we're running through. And we have this 30-day backlink game plan that you
46:58
can actually implement yourself inside the video notes from today. So, it runs you through what to do every single day
47:03
to get results like you can see right here and how we've achieved these back links. And I've shown you the processes
47:09
that we use, how we're getting these back links, etc. We're just creating a lot of content and then getting back links, reaching out to other websites
47:14
and saying, "Hey, do you want to link to us, too?" So, if you want the full 30-day plan to implement that prompts that you can use to automate it with AI,
47:20
you can get that inside the AI success lab. Link in the comments in the description. All right. Now, let's run
47:26
through this as well. The old way is like you would buy a bunch of backlinks from like random websites, submit to
AI-Powered Link Building Techniques
47:32
sketchy directories, waste hours on strategies that don't work. The new way with AI powered link building is like you can find perfect opportunities in
47:38
minutes outreach that actually gets responses and then build relationships not just transactions. So if you want to
47:44
get the full 30-day road map for doing that you can get that inside the free notes from today link in the comments
47:49
description inside the AI success lab. You can also get 100 link building prompts for backlink analysis for
47:54
example outreach email prompts guest post prompts etc. And you can implement all of this for free using the video
48:01
notes from today. I've also added a bonus training here on exactly how to use backlinks to rank number one based
48:06
on what's working for us. And you can get this inside the AI success lab which is completely free. Link in the comments
48:11
description and you can get the video notes inside the AI SEO section right here. All right. And that's how we get

Claude AI SEO Workflow
49:03
This new Claude AI SEO workflow is insane. So, I'm going to show you a brand new way to rank with Clawude AI
49:10
SEO and get results like we're getting right here. You can see us ranking multiple times on the first page of Google. So, for example, if we take this
49:16
keyword, you can see us ranking here and here four times. And then also, you can see us ranking directly with our website
49:22
over here too. Plus with all our shorts, right? to rank about eight times on the first page of Google using this method.
49:27
We use Instagram, YouTube, we use our website, etc. And so, I'm going to break down the whole process today and exactly
49:33
how it gets us results. So, I'm going to show you what I recommend as a strategy for ranking with Claude. And we're going
49:39
to break this down step by step. Okay. Today, what you're going to learn is you're going to learn my strategy for
49:46
ranking and automating in the 30-day system for automate SEO with Claude AI. I'm going to show you the prompts that
49:51
we use as well. And basically, this is a new way to automate your entire SEO strategy using Claude, without hiring
49:58
expensive SEO experts, without spending eight hours doing keyword research, without manually writing blog posts, and without juggling 15 different SEO tools.
50:05
And what we're going to cover today is some of the best ways to use Claude and turn it into your personal SEO specialist, the 30-day SEO automation
50:13
system you can steal from me, and live demos where I build some of these automations from scratch. And this is not the same Claude you used last year.
50:19
Claude can now browse the web. It can now connect across the web and access all sorts of things. It can now
50:25
implement complete SEO workflows in one prompt. And today I'm giving you the exact framework I use at Goldie Agency
50:30
with my team of 50 SEOs. The same system that helps us manage SEO for multiple clients and it's all automated through
50:37
Claude. Whether you're a solarreneur with zero SEO experience or you've been doing this for years and want to 10x your output, this is the workflow that
50:44
changes everything. Let's get straight into it. All right. So, first step you're going to do is you're going to find some low competition keywords and
Automating SEO with Claude AI
50:51
you can easily find keywords directly on, right? So, for example, let's say I am an SEO agency, right? I type that
50:58
into HS here and you can see that it's too competitive to rank for this keyword. So, what we're actually going to do is we're going to go to matching
51:05
terms inside. We're going to filter this down to keyword difficulty 10 or less and we're going to find a bunch of
51:10
keywords that we can easily rank for. Don't take up as much energy or resources because it's lower
51:16
competition, right? And so you can see for example here we've got stuff like technical SEO agency, pretty low competition, decent search volume. We
51:23
could probably rank for that, right? If we take a look at this keyword is quite easy to rank. And if we look at the first page of Google, you can see some
51:29
websites are ranking with zero backlinks or one back or zero backslinks, right? which means it's going to be much easier to rank for that, especially if we build
51:35
backlinks. So, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to plug that keyword into Claude like and what we're going to do
51:40
from here is we're going to take a prompt like you can see. This is literally the same workflow that my team uses. We're going to grab the prompt
51:47
like you can see down here. We're going to copy this in a second and then we'll plug it into Claude. And literally, it's
51:53
so easy to do this. We're going to take that. So, we're going to copy that keyword. We're going to plug it in the insert here section like that. Hit
51:59
enter. And then from here we can start implementing this right and basically what that's going to do is start writing
52:05
out the content for this particular article. And if you have a look for example the articles that we're ranking
52:11
with for example like this one that's literally what we do we just take the transcript from our videos we plug it through claude we use the same prompt
52:17
that I've given you today and then you go off and you start implementing right and so if you look through this page
52:22
what we're actually doing is not just ranking for that keyword also funneling traffic to our funnels that actually
52:27
generate clients. And it's a pretty simple workflow to implement. You can see it's all fully automated and
52:33
optimized and then we rank for that keyword. Now, the other thing to note here is we don't just publish. We
52:38
actually do quality control it before we publish. I don't recommend just sending it straight to your site. You want to be careful with that. And you see it's
52:44
automating the content here. And the way that we're doing this is we're using this checklist, right? And basically, we
52:49
call this the Goldilock zone, which is like a SEO quality control blueprint that you can still do, but it doesn't
52:54
take too long. It only takes about 15 to 20 minutes per article. And so you find the keyword. How do you do that? Use
52:59
address. You automate the content. How do you do that? You just add in your keyword plus a prompt into claude. Right? And then from here, how do you
53:06
quality control? Well, you follow this checklist step by step and you make sure you actually implement it. And that's basically how the process goes. So for
53:12
example, just making sure like you format the text nicely. Making sure that you ask yourself, does this demonstrate
53:18
expertise, experience, authority, and trustworthiness, right? Does this make sure your article matches the search
53:23
intent of Google? What people are trying to find with that content? And that's how we quality control it before we publish it. And that's how we get
53:29
results like this. And this is a beautiful trajectory. As you can see, even just a couple of months ago, we were at like 18 15 clicks a day. Now
53:35
we're at 183. And the chart is going up like that. You can also do this across multiple platforms. For example, if we
53:41
have a look at Reddit, you can see our subreddit right here. If we check out how many views we get on Reddit using similar sort of processes, you can see
53:48
the chart going up quite nicely here as well. So, if you want to steal this process from me, it's inside the AI
53:54
success lab and the video notes from today. As you can see, this is a community that connects you with 43,000
54:00
members. And if you go to the classroom and then go to AI SEO, you can get all the video notes from today. Like you can
54:07
see now, the other thing I want to notice and just mention here is like SEO work is very repetitive, right? So,
54:12
keywords, content briefs, writing articles, technical audits, the same process over and over. And Claude can
54:17
automate the 80% of this automatically. And I call it the Bangkok knockout SEO framework because just like in Muay
54:23
Thai, it's about landing precise strikes that knock out your competition, not throwing like wild punches and hoping
54:29
something lands. So let me show you how this framework works, right? So this is the framework over and there's four rounds. Round one is set up, right? So
54:35
you're going to configure Claude as your SEO specialist. Round two is a research combo. So you're going to automate keyword research and competitor
54:42
analysis. Round three is a content clinch. So you're going to generate SEO optimized content at scale. And then round four is that you can actually
54:48
everything with NASA automations. Now, if you want to see a 30-day plan for actually implementing that with daybyday
54:54
analysis, plus the prompts you can plug in, you can get that from the AI success lab link in the comments description.
55:00
And then some people are going to say, I need to know SEO to use AI for SEO. But the thing is, Claude knows SEO better
55:06
than most SEO experts to be honest with you. So, think about it. Claude has read every SEO blog guide and case study ever
55:11
published. It knows mods. It knows HS documentation. It knows Google's guidelines and patterns, right? And so,
55:17
you don't need to know what canonical tags are, for example. You just need to know how to ask Claude to fix them. And
55:22
I run a 50 person SEO agency, and I can still ask Claude questions about
55:27
technical SEO. And it's not because I'm lazy. It's because Claude has access to more SEO knowledge than any human on the
55:33
planet. And your job isn't to know it. Your job is to ask the right questions and take action. Now, other people say
55:38
AI content, it doesn't rank on Google. The new belief really here is like bad content doesn't rank on Google. AI and
55:45
human editing ranks beautifully. And here's what people get wrong. They think Google has some AI detector that
55:50
penalizes AI content. But Google doesn't care who wrote the content. Google cares if the content is helpful, accurate,
55:56
well structured, better than competitors. So AI content that's just copied and pasted without using that checklist today is trash. But AI content
56:04
that refineses, personalizes, and is genuinely helpful, that's how you get rankings. And one of the ways that we do
56:10
this is we take our video transcripts and then we plug them through Claude. So it has my expertise in there and it has
56:15
my firsthand data content quality isn't generic fluff. It's like stuff that I've spent years testing, right? And the
56:22
Bangkok knockout framework includes human review at every step. So Claude writes a draft, you add your expertise,
56:27
examples, and personality. And that's really the winning formula, right? People say SEO takes too long to see
56:33
results. But honestly, the new belief here is that SEO at scale with AI shows 10 times faster, right? So for example
56:39
here if you go back to Google I'll show you some examples of how this works right so if we have a look here you can
56:44
see for this keyword we created this video one day ago it's already ranking number two on Google right it's already
56:50
ranking two videos right there ranking two and three for that keyword we have a look here as well we've got this article ranking we've got shorts ranking etc
56:57
right you can rank very quickly inside AI and also inside Google let me check
57:02
another one here so for example if we take a look at this keyword and we have a look at the AI views who shows up
57:08
number one in the AIO views, me. Guess who shows up number two in the AIO views? Me. Guess who shows up number
57:13
three? That's me, right? And you can see how we're ranking using this framework. And just to break that belief that SEO,
57:19
it can rank very quickly. Morgan says, "Lol, just learned what canonical tags were yesterday. Welcome to the club."
57:25
And then you can see here is the process. So the old way was writing one article a week, waiting six months,
57:30
hoping that it ranks, right? The new way is you publish 10 articles a week. You test constantly, you find the winners fast. And when you automate the boring
57:37
bits, you can 10x your output. So more content equals more data equals faster learning equals faster results, right?
57:42
And this really just saves a lot of time as well. So you get the same output, actually more, but it costs a fraction of the hours. And that's not SEO being
57:49
slow, that's SEO being smart, right? And that's how you get results with this. So if you want to get the 30-day plan from today, you can get that inside the AI
57:56
success lab link in the comments description. This connects you with 43,000 website owners interested in AI.
58:01
If you go to the classroom section here and then scroll down to AI SEO, you can get the video notes from today and you
58:07
can see that we've actually added another video tutorial showing you how to do this stuff plus all the video
58:12
notes from today, the framework, how to implement it, the 30-day implementation plan. And on top of that, what I've
58:18
actually done is I've added 100 SEO prompts for Claude, for example, for keyword research, for content creation,
58:25
for technical SEO prompts, for content optimization, etc. Right? So, if you want to see this stuff, you can get it
58:31
from me. And just to recap here and show you the process and what we've learned, I've shown you proof that this actually
58:36
works. I've shown you the framework and how to implement it. I've shown you the charts and my Google Search Console
58:41
data, which is honestly what most 99% of SEOs won't show you. And then also, I've
58:47
given you the framework here, plus 100 prompts you can steal from me. And this is all right. Now, if you want to order SEO services online, maybe you like this
58:54
stuff, but you don't want to, you don't have the time or all the resources to do it yourself, you can just order directly online for our backlink portal and you
59:00
can go to this page here and actually order directly. You just order the package you want, right? Also, if you

Minimax AI for Content Creation
59:40
Miniax AI dropped new features that are changing how people create content that ranks on Google and gets found by AI
59:47
search engines. And here's what's wild. While most people still write boring blog posts that nobody reads, right now
59:54
there's a way to create AI powered videos, voices, and content that Google, YouTube, Plexi, and Claud all
1:00:00
recommended to their users. And most people have no clue this exists. So, what I'm going to show you today is a 30
1:00:06
plan to really get results with Miniax and its AI Asia Miniax 2.1. And I'll
1:00:11
show you how to build a content machine. Even if you've never touched video editing software, even if you hate being
1:00:17
on camera, even if you have zero technical skills, we're going to build some really cool stuff today using this.
1:00:23
So for example, what you can see inside the miniax platform right here is that
1:00:29
you can go to agent.mminia and you can actually start using this for AI SEO. So
1:00:34
for example here, if we actually have a look at this page, what we've built is a landing page. You can build websites out
1:00:40
using miniax that actually work as kind of like a lead generation form, right? So if you have an agency, then you can
1:00:46
create a landing page that's beautifully designed on a subdomain and then you can host it on a custom domain later if you
1:00:51
want to. people have to enter their email address to get this audit and then once they do they get the lead magnet to them. Now you can also use this for
1:00:58
creating content, right? So for example, if we actually go into a new chat here,
1:01:04
this is the exact same strategy that we use for example for this website. So I'll just take that strategy and I'll show you how to do this inside Miniax.
1:01:10
What we're going to do here for example is we are going to take an example prompt and we'll go into Miniax and then
1:01:17
we'll put okay, here's our keyword keyword equals and then we'll just put an example. So maybe like SEO training
1:01:23
London just as a random example. If you're ever struggling for keywords, by the way, you can just go into Google and check out the complete. So you can put,
1:01:29
for example, SEO training and then type in whatever place you want to rank in. For example, if I was in the SEO
1:01:34
training niche. So let's take the SEO training free option. As you can see, we're going to plug that in over here.
1:01:39
And then from here, we'll start generating the content using one of my prompts from the AI profit boardroom. If
1:01:45
you not checked out the AI profit boardroom, just go to the classroom here. And then inside this section, if you go to the playbook and then you're
1:01:52
going to go down to video to blog posts, you can actually grab the prompt that I use for generating content. Right? So,
1:01:58
we can take this in. So, we'll copy this prompt, go back to miniax, plug in the prompt, like I'm just going to say
1:02:04
create an article using the prompt below. Right? And we'll hit run on that. And then that can start generating a
1:02:09
blog post for us. Right? So, that's one of the ways you can automate content. Again, this is what we've used for this website. So, I'm only showing you stuff
1:02:16
that actually works for me. That's the way I like to do things. And if you go to the blog here, you can see some examples of content that we've automated
1:02:22
with AI. We actually use Claude mostly for this content, but you could use Miniaax in the same way. Right? So, I've
1:02:28
shown you some different methods you can use for doing this. Here's another example. So, you could actually create, for example, like avatars like you can
1:02:35
see here. Create images and then rank them directly on Google as well. So, for example, if we go on to Google here and
1:02:41
we'll type in an example keyword. Then, we're going to go to images. If you look at some of the keywords that rank in,
1:02:46
for example, like this image right here, this is actually from Reddit subreddit, right? And so it's taking the thumbnail
1:02:52
and the image that we've ranked for this keyword and plugging it into Google, right? Now, how do you automate the
1:02:58
images themselves to rank on Google? You can go back into Mini Maxine and create images pretty quickly and easily like
1:03:03
you see right here, right? Pretty simple. Anesto says, "Hi, nice to see you sharing again always. Great to see
1:03:08
you here, Anesto." And you can see some other examples. Here's another example of a image that we posted on Reddit via
1:03:15
a video and then that image ranks directly inside Google, right? And again, like I only want to show you
1:03:21
stuff that's working for me. Take it as you will. Use what you like and ignore what you don't like. But that's basically how it works. So, I've shown
1:03:27
you three different ways you can use Miniax 2.1 for AI SEO. So, number one
1:03:32
would be actually creating blog posts like you see right here. Number two would be generating images. Number
1:03:39
three, I've shown you the example email landing page that you can build out as well. And then here's another example of
1:03:46
a finalized blog that we've created here, right? And then you can just copy paste and edit that before you post
1:03:52
directly. The other thing I would say here is you always want to make sure that you actually proofread and approve the content before you publish it. I
1:03:59
have this full SEO checklist that me and my team run through when we're posting content for clients just to make sure
1:04:04
like the content is optimized in the right way that we're not doing anything crazy here because the thing about
1:04:10
creating content with AI is it can be bad if you don't proofread it, if you don't check it, if you don't run through a manual checklist before you publish.
1:04:17
And so you can easily give something like this to your team and then your team can go off and start creating the content and everything else, right? But
1:04:23
yeah, that's basically it. Now I call this the miniax momentum method and this is basically a personal framework for
1:04:29
using miniax to dominate search engines and get more leads traffic and customers on autopilot right so when we're doing
1:04:36
this for example if we have a look here some people will say let's have a look here SEO is just about written content
1:04:41
and backlinks actually I wouldn't say that necessarily minimax can actually create videos and you can rank those on Google too right so for example if we go
1:04:49
on to Google here we type in I don't know something like this right something like that yeah and you can see us
1:04:54
ranking on the first page of Google, but we're not ranking with our website for this particular keyword. So, if we look
1:04:59
at this keyword as a case study, you can see us ranking three times with our videos, not with our articles. And then
1:05:05
our articles probably do rank further down the page if we have a look here. But the actual video itself ranks way
1:05:12
higher, right? And the other cool thing about that is you get the traffic not just from Google, but also from YouTube.
1:05:18
So if we type in the same thing into YouTube, you can see us ranking right at the top for that keyword right here. The
1:05:24
other cool thing is as well like you can rank inside AI search engines with video very easily. It'll rank very quickly as
1:05:30
well. So for example, if we go inside Complexity and we type in the same keyword and we're looking for stuff here. We'll look at where it sources
1:05:37
information. So we'll review the top sources and you can see here it actually sources two of our YouTube videos,
1:05:43
right? So this is my YouTube channel here. And then if we go over here, you see another YouTube channel down here as
1:05:48
well, right? And so you can create videos that rank directly inside Plexi, inside Google, inside the search
1:05:55
engines, and then you're good to go. And that's multiple ways you can do use Google for AIO with Miniax. So if you
1:06:00
wanted to create a video that that you can generate with Miniax, you can just go into Miniax here and then you can
1:06:06
click on videos and then you would type in the video that you want, right? So for example, you can see some examples
1:06:12
of what people have created right here. Usually these videos are pretty short, right? And the way that I would get
1:06:17
around that is you actually ask Mini Maps to stitch them all together, right? So for example, if you create like 10
1:06:23
5-second clips and then you stitch them all together that makes a minute long video, right? If you want an even easier
1:06:28
way to create longer form faceless videos with AI, you can go to something like notebook. That is a free tool. Got
1:06:34
loads of training on YouTube about it if you want to learn this stuff for free. And then once you've plugged in your sources about what you want to write
1:06:40
about or create videos about over here, you can go to video overview and generate a free video inside notebook as
1:06:45
well. And that's another way to start using Miniax or AI SEO to start ranking. All right, this is basically some of the
1:06:52
best stuff that you can use to really start generating. Muhammad says, is it free? Is Miniax free? I'm going to show you some examples of how you can use
1:06:59
this for free. All right, so number one, you can use agent.mmax for free, but it's very limited on the credit, so I
1:07:05
wouldn't actually recommend it. If you want to use Mini Mats for free, one of the easiest ways you can do this is you
1:07:10
can go over to O Lama. You're going to download O Lama, right? So download that and you can host it locally. And then
1:07:17
what you can do over here is if you go to models, right? And you type in MiniAX 2.1, you actually get a free version of
1:07:23
Emacs 2.1 that you can run locally inside Olama. And that's the best way to get free access to Miniax, right?
1:07:29
Actually runs from the cloud, which means there are limits, but I've never hit the limits. I don't know anyone who has. And so I don't think that's going
1:07:35
to be an issue at all. And that's basically how to use Miniax 2.1 to start generating AI content. What I've

1:09:15
All right, the Mr. everywhere method for SEO. One video becomes 50 pieces of content across every platform your
Mr. Everywhere Method for SEO
1:09:23
customers are searching. Google, YouTube, Replexity, Chat GBT, Claude, Reddit, Tik Tok, LinkedIn, Instagram,
1:09:29
all from a single recording session. And here's the thing that most people don't realize. AI search engines like Plexity
1:09:36
and Chat GPT are now recommended. YouTube videos as their primary sources and the game has completely changed when
1:09:41
it comes to AI SEO. So, I'm just going to break down what I mean. And if you have any questions as you go along, feel free to ask. You can see, for example,
1:09:47
here, this is our website that we're doing this with. And you can also have a look, for example, our YouTube channel
1:09:53
here where we are generating live streams and videos that rank on Google
1:09:59
and also re repurpose that recording session into many other pieces of content. So, I'm going to break down the
1:10:05
whole strategy today, show you how it works, show you what we're doing, etc. And I'll take some random examples and just break down how this works. All
1:10:12
right? So for example, if we have a look at this particular keyword, you can see it's ranking up here. You can see it's
1:10:17
ranking down here. You can see it's ranking over here. You can see it's ranking inside AO views, right? And this is with one single piece of content that
1:10:24
we record and then we turn it into many other pieces of content, right? And you can see this is a video that's ranking
1:10:30
number one for that keyword. Now, this is actually on a smaller YouTube channel of mine, so don't feel like you need to
1:10:35
have a massive massive following to do this. You can also see our blog post here that's ranking for that keyword
1:10:40
inside AIO views. If you go down the first page of Google, you can see like we've got one, two, three different
1:10:47
videos ranking for that keyword. And this is quite a simple system. You can see also we've got julian.com and we
1:10:53
have a LinkedIn post even ranking for that keyword as well. So if we pull up this LinkedIn post for example, all it
1:10:58
is literally a video with a breakdown of our caption as you can see. And so we're
1:11:04
publishing this content across many different channels. I'm just going to log into LinkedIn and I'll show you how this works on LinkedIn for example to
1:11:10
break this down for you. All right. So, for example, on LinkedIn, we'll create a lot of posts in many different ways, chop off our existing videos, and then
1:11:17
plug that into content that ranks on Google like you can see LinkedIn video that I just showed you a second ago. If
1:11:23
we take some more videos from our channel, I can even pull up like smaller channels to show you an example how this
1:11:29
works. And so, if we go to Julian Goldie Agency on YouTube, go to this channel,
1:11:35
right? So, this is another channel of mine where we're doing the same sort of thing. If we type in for example GLM4.7,
1:11:41
you can see our video is ranking here and also here, right? So as you scroll down the results, like there's a lot of
1:11:46
big websites competing. You've got hugging face, you've got medium, you've got open room, the videos are ranking
1:11:51
really well at the top. And so our process really for this is to basically create one piece of content, right? So
1:11:58
you really just master one recording and then you unbundle everything and extract all the possible content pieces. I'll
1:12:04
show you another example of how to do this. So if we go on to Twitter for example, we'll actually take the content
1:12:09
and then we'll plug it into a tweet but also an article, right? So if you have a look at our articles, they're all based
1:12:15
on one single video. We even use the image itself on Twitter articles as the
1:12:21
thumbnail and then you've got the video embedded here. Right? So we create one tweet and then we create one article and
1:12:27
then that funnels traffic to our funnels as well. Right? So if we have a look at this particular page, you can see that
1:12:32
it's funning traffic to our main sources as well as my profile. So it's quite a simple system. Urban Fusion says, "Good
1:12:39
evening. Good to see you." And we'll just get straight into how we do this, what we're doing, what the process is, what the strategy is, etc. So one thing
1:12:46
that I noticed, and this sort of happened to me a couple of years ago by mistake, was I was creating a lot of AI
1:12:52
and SEO related public case studies, right? And one of the problems was my website. I actually show you an example
1:12:58
here. We go back to julian.com. So, Google actually de-indexed my website like about probably about a year and a
1:13:04
half ago now. And they did that because I was showing these public case studies and I don't blame happened to a bunch of influencers. But basically, we got our
1:13:10
website taken down, right? We got a de-index from Google. You can see, for example, if we actually go back and we look at the last sort of 16 months. Look
1:13:18
at that. 3000. Our website literally got de-index from Google, right? And now we've made a
1:13:23
comeback. We made an insane comeback to be fair. And you can see a nice trajectory. But what I realized from
1:13:29
this whole process was that you can't just rely on one channel. Because if you have one website or you have one
1:13:35
platform to get traffic and that gets clapped, then it's GG. It's game over. And so what you want to do is just
1:13:40
create many pieces of content that are still high quality across many different platforms. And then not only do you get
1:13:46
more opportunities to you can also rank inside views. You can rank inside complexity as well. You can rank inside check all sorts of places, right? So for
1:13:53
example, if we plug in the same keyword into for example here we plug in something like that. This tends to use a
1:13:59
very similar process to Google right. So you can see for example here it's pulling in YouTube videos for that
1:14:05
keyword. It's pulling in Reddit threads and all sorts of things. And so when you're doing this for example you can
1:14:11
literally make sure that you're ranking inside Google but also inside many other AI search engines. And so that's the
1:14:17
process, right? And so we'll chop it up. We'll put it on LinkedIn. We'll put it on our newsletters on LinkedIn as well.
1:14:22
So not just a single post but also a newsletter. So you can see for example here these newsletters like we have the
1:14:28
AI automation insider and these get published on Google and index on Google as well. And then we also have these
1:14:33
sort of posts where we funnel traffic just like X. In fact it's very similar to X. We embed the video. We have the
1:14:39
links to our funnels here. And also the cool thing about this is you don't just get traffic directly from Google. You
1:14:44
don't just get traffic directly from Twitter but you also get the platform traffic as well. Right? So, for example,
1:14:50
anyone on LinkedIn sees our old posts, that drives traffic and interest to my funnels as well. So, this is one of the
1:14:56
best strategies I've seen in 2026 that's working to get a lot of traffic across many different platforms. For example,
1:15:03
we'll take exactly the same caption, the exact same title, for example, post on Facebook and even on Facebook, we get a
1:15:09
lot of reach. So, for example, if I switch back to my business profile here, right, and we go to my profile, number
1:15:16
one live streams pop up pretty quickly. We've got our Facebook ads running as well. And then if we go to my profile
1:15:22
here and we go to professional dashboard, I'll show you some of the reach that we get from doing this on Facebook as well. So once this loads,
1:15:28
there we go. All right. So you can see, for example here, 3rd of January, 197,000 views. 28th of December, 231,000
1:15:35
views, right? And all we're doing is chopping up our videos and then plugging them into Facebook and that will rank on
1:15:41
Google, but also rank inside the platform as well. And we're not really changing anything about the content itself. If you go to my Facebook profile
1:15:48
here, there we go. You can see, for example, if we keep scrolling down here, you can see that we're literally just uploading videos directly to Facebook as
1:15:55
you can see, right? And so, you can generate quite a lot of reach using this method as well. And then, for example,
1:16:01
if we have a look at this one, you can see here, four likes that will gradually reach out to more people. This one as
1:16:06
well, one more one comment, two shares. Anesso commented on the video. So, you can reach a lot of people with your
1:16:11
actual social media posts. And then you rank on Google, but you also rank inside the actual platform itself. So if we go
1:16:18
back to the process here, inspired Michelle says, "Good morning from Vancouver. Good to see you again, Michelle. Welcome." So here's the full
Julian Goldie Content Multiplication System
1:16:25
multiplication framework, right? I call this a Julian Goldie content multiplication system. So number one, you're going to master recording. Then
1:16:32
you're going to unbundle everything, right? Then you're going to leverage AI to automate the repurposing with Claude.
1:16:37
So, for example, if we actually go on to Claude here, if I'm posting on X or if my team are posting on X, what they're
1:16:43
actually going to do, like you'll see here, is they're going to plug in the video transcript, plug that into here,
1:16:50
and we can create like five different posts from the same video transcript and then post those onto X as well or onto
1:16:56
YouTube or on LinkedIn and stuff like that. So, for example, here you'll see that on our profile, we're basically
1:17:02
taking the content, just adding that caption from Claude, and then that goes off and reaches a lot of people. So,
1:17:08
it's a pretty powerful way to repurpose your content and plug it in across everywhere. And again, you can use
1:17:14
Claude to help you do this. I would recommend targeting many different platforms. So, for example, we'll post across link. I think at this point, we
1:17:20
might we keep expanding out. We've reached like 49 different platforms that we post on in terms of different profiles and different social media. You
1:17:27
don't have to go as crazy as that. You could just post two or three platforms at first. But the main thing is that you're multiplying one single video. The
1:17:34
reason that I like video as well is it's taking firsthand information, right? I only talk about what I'm actually doing.
1:17:39
And so the cool thing about that is it makes my content completely unique from all the other generic fluff that's being
1:17:44
published with AI out there, right? And so if I talk for example about my website here, that's unique first time
1:17:50
case study data that goes into the transcript that then goes into the clawed post that we create. And so
1:17:57
you're not creating generic fluff. You're actually creating something that's actually very interesting and valuable because it's unique from everyone else's. From there, you're
1:18:03
going to iterate fast. So you're going to post daily and learn weekly. So for example, for us, we'll look at our analytics and we'll see, okay, what's
1:18:10
working? Okay, let's double down on that. Let's keep improving, right? We'll look at the post, figure out, okay, what can we improve in the actual content
1:18:15
itself? And then we'll also create permanent assets, right? Build SEO
1:18:20
optimized articles that actually get traffic over time consistently. So for example, if we go to our blog here,
1:18:26
we'll create these articles and they might not rank straight away. The cool thing about that is they might rank in
1:18:31
three months or six months and once they're ranking, they generate traffic for a long time, right? So for example, we typing Claude AI SEO to Google. Let's
1:18:38
see what we got here. So you can see my video ranking here and here, right? this three times on the first page of Google
1:18:43
and eventually our other assets will rank as well, but already we'll rank it three times on the first page of Google
1:18:49
with one single piece of content that my team could repurpose. And you just keep iterating, improving it, and then you're
1:18:55
going to link stuff together. So, for example, if we have a look at our X articles, we go to X here, we link
1:19:01
inside our profile, and then we also link inside our articles to the pages that we want to send traffic to, right?
1:19:07
As you can see, so inside each piece of content after the tweet itself, we're linking back to our portal. And then
1:19:13
also if we go back here, you can see that we're linking inside the article to our portal as well, right? And so you
1:19:18
can repurpose and link back to everything here. And then you're just going to let the system snowball because
1:19:23
this compounds over time, right? So for example, if we log into Reddit account, for example, you can see that we're
1:19:29
reaching 75,000 people per month. Now that has compounded a lot over time. So you can see the growth over time. That's
1:19:36
pretty crazy. Month one, we reach like 1,700 people. Month two, 6,000 people.
1:19:41
And this is yielding compound results of just creating SEO content consistently
1:19:47
over time. And so that is the Julian coffee content multiplication system. And some people say, I need to create
1:19:53
unique content every platform. Really, one great video contains 50 pieces of content waiting to be extracted, right?
1:20:00
And the video contains like 10 different short clips, five different LinkedIn post, three Twitter threads, one full
1:20:06
blog post, 15 quote graphics, one podcast, multiple Reddit answers or multiple threads, right? And so, you
1:20:12
know, you're not creating more content, you're extracting what's already there. You can use something like dcript as well to transcribe everything
1:20:18
automatically and claude turns that transcript into whatever format you need. So, you know, you're just using two tools to repurpose the content and
1:20:25
then you get unlimited output. Let me show you an example. So if we go up to dscript here, we'll log in. All right. So if we pull up our dscript profile,
1:20:32
this like a video edited software, so you can just plug in that one single video that you make. Michelle says, "Would you use opus clips?" I would
1:20:38
recommend using Opus Clips is pretty good. I heard it's got a lot better actually recently. So I only talk about stuff that I personally use. I'm not
1:20:44
using Opus Clips to be honest. We're using Dcript. And I'll show you how we do it. So if we open up this project
1:20:49
here, might take a couple of minutes. Basically, you can use the AI editor inside Dcript and then that can go off
1:20:55
and edit your box for you. Inspire Michelle says, "Julian, my direct business has a personal domain that's
1:21:01
run to GHL. We run traffic to a free course, but the core website is the same for everyone. Is there a way to recommend high?" Yeah. So, you know, if
1:21:08
you check out my videos on SEO, we actually have a dedicated YouTube channel for SEO, as you can see right
1:21:13
here. Um, basically, I actually break down in this AI SEO 20 26 masterass what
1:21:19
we're doing in terms of how we rank, right? And it basically comes down to three things which is keywords, content, links, and then just repurposing the
1:21:26
content across multiple platforms. That's what I'm finding works really great now. And then if you want to edit your videos or you want to, for example,
1:21:33
turn it into a social media post, you can just click this button over here and it actually automatically edit it for you and you can type in, for example,
1:21:41
create a short clip of this or create a highlight reel with this and it actually edit the video automatically create a
1:21:46
version that you can post across multiple platforms. Some people say repurposed content doesn't perform as
1:21:51
well as native content. Let me show you some examples of this. So if we actually go over to my social media posts
1:21:58
actually test and so if we have a look at some of my social media posts here as you can see we'll scroll down. You can
1:22:03
see for example this is a repurposed clip. We just use Claude to generate a caption and that reached 50,000 people
1:22:10
with one single video. Right? Pretty crazy. You see here it's got 1,000 bookmarks, 76 retweets, 653 hearts and
1:22:18
favorites, lots of people replying to it. Literally all we did was just plug the transcript through Claude like I showed you a second ago and then post
1:22:24
the video to X. So works really well. And inspire Michelle says, "Okay, I'm following Judy method log. Thanks
1:22:30
script. I have no clue how to use it." There you go. Yeah. So that works really well. And I'm testing this daily. And
1:22:36
the more we do it, the better we get at this, right? So at first we you can see all the reds here like our content was
1:22:41
just not performing at all and then we gradually just kept testing and testing to the point where we'll post one thing
1:22:47
out it gets 50,000 views and we're just improving and iterating on that process. So definitely works and it improves the
1:22:53
more you do this the better you get. The better you get, the more reach you get. And again, like we post this on X and all our profiles, right? Some people say
1:23:00
repurposed content doesn't perform as well as native content. Repurpose content optimized for each platform outperforms most native content because
1:23:07
here's what most people get wrong. Like they take a YouTube video, just slap it on with no changes. Now, of course, that
1:23:12
wouldn't work. The Met Everywhere method we're talking about here, you take the same core message, but you optimize the
1:23:18
format, length, hook, and the style for each platform's algorithm. So, it's the same insight, but it's different
1:23:24
packaging for each platform. Is for me, I pretty much eat like the same meals every day and the same macros, the same
1:23:30
nutritional value. Sometimes it's steak, sometimes it's chicken, sometimes it's eggs, but it's the same fuel, right?
1:23:35
Different presentation. So, when you optimize repurposed content properly, often performs better than native
1:23:40
content because you're using proven messages that already resonated with your audience and other platforms. Claude can handle all the rewriting and
1:23:47
you just give it a transcript and tell it which platform you're targeting. And that's basically how it works. Now, if
1:23:52
you want a 30-day plan for implementing this, then I've actually given you a 30-day implementation plan like you see
1:23:58
right here. Guides you through what to do each day, the prompts, the homework, etc. And you can just implement this for
1:24:04
your business like you can see. And also, what I've also done is added 100 prompts for this method, right? So,
1:24:10
whether it's video plug-in prompts, you can use these or for example, Gemini, whatever you want. And we've got these
1:24:16
clip extraction prompts as it basically we are prompts for every single part of the process. So that's inside the AI
1:24:22
success lab which is completely free. Link in the comments description or just ask chat GBT for the link for Julian

1:25:36
number one in AI search engines, not Google not being AI search engines like Chat GPT, Plexity, Claude, and AIO Views
1:25:44
and the ones everyone is now using instead of Google. And here's the crazy part. No one is talking about this yet. Over the next few minutes, I'm going to
1:25:50
show you exactly how I use YouTube videos to rank inside AI search results. You can see an example here. We're ranking on the first page of Google one,
1:25:57
two, three times on Google for that particular keyword. And you can see how easy it is to really pull your videos in
1:26:04
and get results for this. The powerful thing about videos is they can rank inside Google, but they can also rank
1:26:11
inside AIO views. So, for example, if we type in notebook LM update here, it pulls in an AIO view. And who does it
Introduction to AI and SEO
1:26:17
link to? It links to Google and it also links to my videos as well. So videos are really powerful for ranking with
1:26:22
SEO. You can also see me ranking once there as well. And then also on the first page of Google as well, right? And
1:26:29
so this is a powerful way to start getting ranking really quickly. Okay?
1:26:34
And what I'm going to show you today is basically how you can do this without being on camera, without spending thousands on video production, without
Automating AI Avatar Videos
1:26:41
needing any technical skills. And I will show you how to automate AI avatar videos that actually rank videos that
1:26:46
show up when someone asks Chat cheap or Plexi a question about your niche. And think about this for a second, right?
1:26:52
Billions of searches are happening every single day, right? On AI platforms,
1:26:57
right? And your video could be the one that gets recommended, not because you paid for ads, not because you got lucky
1:27:02
with the algorithm, but because you understood how AI search engines actually find and recommend content. So,
1:27:07
I'm going to walk you through my exact system, the free tools, the prompts, the 30-day to get your first videos ranking
1:27:13
in AI search, and you will see everything live on screen, just the actual process I use, so that by the end
1:27:18
of this, you have a complete framework that you can copy and steal from me. Whether you run a service business, sell products, you have an agency, or you
1:27:25
just want more eyeballs on your content, this works even if you've never made a video before. Let's get straight into
1:27:30
it. So the method that we're actually going to be using today is something called the video AI domination
Understanding AI Search Engines
1:27:36
framework. Okay. And one thing to note here is that AI search engines they don't work like Google, right? They
1:27:42
don't just look at keywords and backlinks. They understand context, relevance, authority in a completely different way. So when someone asks chat
1:27:49
question, it pulls from sources it trusts. Now YouTube is one of those sources. Perplexi actively searches
1:27:55
YouTube for answers. Let me show you an example of this. So we go on to perplexity here and we'll put like notebook AI updates something like that.
1:28:01
What you can see here is that it actually sources updates from YouTube. Right? So if we look at the reviewed
1:28:07
sources here, you can see that it's pulled in three different videos from YouTube inside perplexity. Right? So if
1:28:13
we have a look here, you've got this video and this is a video from Julian Gold SEO as you can see. So that's my
1:28:19
channel right there. If we go over to this video, you can also see that's another video from us as well ranking
1:28:25
inside Plexity, right? And so we're ranking on Google and we're also ranking inside Perplexity using this method. And
1:28:31
Claude references video content in its responses too. So this is a massive shift. The game has changed and most
1:28:37
people haven't caught on yet. Now, why does video crush text AI search? AI systems love video content for three
Why Video Content Dominates AI Search
1:28:44
reasons. Number one, video has multiple signals. You know, it's got audio, visual transcripts, engagement metrics. There's more data points for AI to
1:28:51
understand your content. Second, video builds trust faster. So AI systems
1:28:56
recognize that video creators put more effort in and that signals authority. Number three, video gets cited more. So
1:29:02
when AI needs to recommend a source, video feels more complete than a blog post. And bear in mind, AI can generate
1:29:07
a blog post at any time. It doesn't really need to reference blog posts, but it doesn't create long videos with interesting case studies, right? One of
Creating AI Avatar Videos for Free
1:29:14
the things people going to say is, I need expensive equipment to make good videos. But actually, AI avatar videos
1:29:19
create professional videos for free. You can actually go on to something like notebook lamb and you can generate videos for free using this method and
1:29:26
then rank them on Google which then in turn ranks inside AI search engines and other places right so for example if we
1:29:32
have a look here we've got the video on the right hand side this was actually from a video I generated earlier today
1:29:37
this is actually AI narrated and it's a full long video like 6 minutes 26 seconds and you can see this runs people
1:29:44
through the topic they were trying to rank for right so how to watch football like a scout and so it creates the
1:29:50
design. It narrates a video. It generates everything and all we need to do is pull in the sources that we want
1:29:55
to reference. And then we can easily download this as you can see and we're good to go. You could upload that to
1:30:00
YouTube. The other method that you can see is that on our YouTube channel, for example, if we check out this YouTube
1:30:06
channel, we quite often use AI avatar videos inside our content. Right now, how do you do that? We actually have a
1:30:12
full method inside the AI profit boardroom that shows you exactly how to do this in the AI avatar video section.
1:30:19
And if you go to the classroom here inside the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description, go to the playbook and then scroll down to the AI
1:30:26
avatar video section and you can find the asset right there. Okay, so if you want to learn our process for doing
1:30:31
this, you can check it out inside the AR profit boardroom. But it's quite easy to automate videos. Again, you can do it
1:30:36
for free with notebook. We've already shown you how to do that. And so you can create professional videos for free. So
1:30:42
it's a really powerful way. Now some people say YouTube is too competitive to start right now. AI search is a new
The Power of AI Search and Competition
1:30:47
platform with almost zero competition. When I started out in SEO, everyone said Google was too competitive. Too many websites, too many established players.
1:30:53
I ignored them, built an agency, helped my mom retire, and now I reach over 100 million people per year across all platforms, right? So the lesson is
1:31:00
competition is not your problem. Timing is your opportunity. AI search is where YouTube was 10 years ago. It's wide
1:31:05
open, right? And waiting for someone to claim the space. And that someone could be you. Also, some people will say like
1:31:11
video SEO takes months to see results. But the new belief really is that AI search can surface your content within
1:31:17
days. Right? So if we go back here and we look at this content, guess what's ranking number one for this particular
1:31:22
keyword? Well, it's my video right here. When was the video created? 4 hours ago, as you can see right there. And so this
1:31:28
content ranks very quickly indeed. And that was within 4 hours. So traditional SEO is very slow, right? And I know this
1:31:34
better than anyone. I run an SEO agency. We tell clients to expect 90 days minimum. But AI search is a different
1:31:39
game. Complexity updates in real time. Chat GT pulls in from recent sources and your video could get cited within days
1:31:46
of publishing. And this is why I block like 100 minutes plus per day every day to focus on the biggest constraint in my
1:31:51
business. And right now that constraint for most people is not being visible in AI search of people say I need thousands
1:31:57
of subscribers, but AI search cares about content quality, not subscriber counts. I have 300,000 plus subscribers
1:32:04
on YouTube. And here's what I noticed is like some of my newer videos with fewer views actually get cited by AI more than
1:32:09
my viral ones, right? And why is that? It's because AI looks at relevance and quality, not vanity metrics. So, you
1:32:15
know, a video with 500 views that perfectly answers a specific question will beat a video with 500,000 views
1:32:20
that's too broad. And this is great news for you so you can compete from day one. So, let's talk about a 90-day framework
90-Day Framework for AI SEO
1:32:26
in terms of how you can implement this. You want to start finding questions that people are looking for. I actually got a
1:32:31
prompt to automate that. The other thing you can do is you can go into Google and you can just look through the auto
1:32:36
suggests and see what people are searching around your niche. Right? Right. So if I'm in the AI niche and I'm trying to create content around
1:32:42
notebook, it would be very easy to find like all these different updates around it. Right? And that's how you do the keyword research. What you can do is you
1:32:48
can go to chat GPT. You can plug in a keyword and then you can go from there. Wilty says, "What can AI money lab help
1:32:55
me do until I'm ready for the AI lab?" Yeah. So there like inside the AI success lab, right? If you go here, what
AI Success Lab and Community
1:33:00
you're going to find is like a number one, you get a community of 42,000 people that you just connect with instantly. So you can post in the
1:33:06
community, ask for help and support. You also get access to our free AI automation master classes like you see
1:33:11
on pretty much every single AI technology out there. This section, we update it daily with the new update. So
1:33:16
everything you need to know about AI is inside this section. We have a full section on what you can see here, right?
1:33:22
So how to make money with AI and then also inside the classroom, you can see that we have a full section on AI SEO as
1:33:28
well. So everything you need to succeed AI is inside this community and it's completely free. Link in the comments description. So if we go back to chat
1:33:35
now we can say at as a market researcher put your niche in there. So we're going to put in for example like SEO and then
1:33:41
we can start publishing this and just getting some keywords right Wilty says looks like great content. Thanks very
1:33:46
much and then you see it finds a bunch of keywords you could potentially rank for. They're super specific. I'll almost
1:33:52
say they're too long tail but if you want to start somewhere you can start there. All right. And then if you want to generate the videos well you can use
1:33:58
hey genen or you can use notebook them for ranking and you just make sure on the content itself for example if we
1:34:05
have a look at Julian go agents that you include the keywords inside the content right so you can see here keyword right
1:34:10
there right frontloaded inside the title keyword right there boom here we go right if we actually type that keyword
1:34:16
on Google let's have a look here so how to do this we'll see whether it ranks and let's see what we got here yeah you
1:34:22
can see that my LinkedIn article is ranking for that keyword on the first page of Google along with that page as
1:34:29
well, right? And bear in mind these pages are created from the video content itself. So if we have a look at this page, you can see our video is embedded
1:34:36
on the page. So it's pretty easy to create the content and then just rank it either with your blog or with your video as well. Cool thing is like you can
1:34:42
create blogs from the videos and then rank those as well. So that's basically it. That's the whole process of doing
1:34:47
this, how to implement it. I've talked about the 30-day framework and the old way versus the new way. The old way was
1:34:52
spent thousands on camera equipment and lighting. The new way is you can use free AI avatar videos to create
1:34:57
professional videos instantly. The old way was you need to look good on camera and be comfortable speaking. The new way
1:35:02
is AI avatars handle the delivery. You just write the script. The new way is generating videos that come ready to
1:35:08
upload. And then when it comes to ranking inside Google or other AI search engines, the old way was like waiting 6
1:35:15
to 12 months for Google to rank your content. The new AI search can surface your video days as I've shown you today.
1:35:20
Right? The old way was competing against millions of websites for keywords. The new way AI search is almost zero
1:35:26
competition rate. The old way was needing expensive backlinks to rank. The new way is AI search values content quality and link metrics. The old way
1:35:32
was fighting algorithm changes to tank your websites overnight. And the new way is like AI searches focus on relevance,
1:35:38
not gaming the system. So you got all the strategies, all the processes, all the systems from today, the 30-day plan
1:35:44
and how to implement this yourself. If you want us to do SEO for you, we actually have an offer of a free SEO
1:35:50

1:36:15
including the video notes from today. So, feel free to get that link in the comments in description. And thanks for watching. I will see you on the next
1:36:21
one. Cheers. Bye-bye. Today, I'm going to show you how to do parasite AI SEO on
Reddit SEO Strategy
1:36:26
Reddit. This is one of the strategies we use. You can see, for example, our subreddit here actually gets 70,000
1:36:31
views per month by creating content. This is not like spammy content. It's actually like content people enjoy
1:36:36
reading. You see here, for example, people commenting on it. We publish a lot of content. and we got 3,800 members. We only started this a few
1:36:43
months ago, this subreddit, I actually thought it was too late and wouldn't work and then it began to take off and now we basically just publish our videos
1:36:50
like you can see inside the channel here. And we also publish a lot of articles as well. So, I'm going to show
1:36:55
you how the process works and what we do and how to do it step by step and how to replicate this yourself in case you're interested in getting traffic. And the
1:37:01
great thing about Reddit is it is free to use, right? You don't have to pay to use Reddit. Anyone can post on there.
1:37:08
anyone can start up the subreddit. And what I've actually done is for the resources for this live stream, I've
1:37:13
actually created a list of stuff that you can use to help you to generate this. And the main thing to note here is
1:37:19
like Reddit SEO is really powerful because Google made a deal with Reddit. And now Reddit can rank really quickly
1:37:26
on page one of Google and also AI search engines within 24 hours. Like not weeks, not months, but hours. And I'll show you
1:37:32
an example, right? So for example, if we go over to perplexity here, as you can see, and we'll just put something like
1:37:37
no book AI, LM SEO, right? Something like that, right? What you can see is it will actually source different sources
1:37:43
around the web and it will pull in for example like LinkedIn or for example YouTube and that sort of thing, right?
1:37:49
And basically what you can do is you can actually rank this content not just inside Reddit as you can see also inside
1:37:57
AI search engines. So people searching via, right? So if you have a look at, for example, this keyword, you can see
1:38:02
that my Reddit article from the subreddit is actually ranking inside perplexity directly and it's got links
1:38:08
to all my funnels right at the top to convert that traffic, right? And you can see another example here. So this is the traffic for this website. We're using
1:38:14
the same technique but on the website and it works. So even if you don't want to do it directly on Reddit, no problem. You can actually do it on a website like
1:38:20
you can see here. And the other thing you want to see here is like we're actually embedding a YouTube video at the top. We don't just rank directly
1:38:27
inside Google. We don't just rank inside Perlexi and AI search engines, but we also rank directly on YouTube as well as
1:38:34
you're 5xing your traffic at this point. And you see it's neatly formatted. The content reads really nicely. This
1:38:40
article itself actually got 2,500 views directly on the platform as you can see right there. So if we zoom in on that,
1:38:45
there we go. All right. And then if we go on see more insights as well, you can see how it's performing. So 2,500 views,
1:38:52
a decent amount of those from the United States, bunch of up votes, etc. six shares. Six people shared this content
1:38:58
and it's pretty simple and easy. You can actually see where it shared as well, which is interesting, too. So, I
1:39:04
actually never look at those analytics, but I should pay more attention. The other cool thing here as well is we created that 3 months ago, but it's
1:39:09
still ranking inside Perplexity, right? So, that's a great thing about this is when you're doing this, like you're creating content now, but it ranks this
1:39:16
week inside Reddit. It could rank in 3 months time inside AI search engines and its reach just expands. You never get
1:39:23
less views on a piece of content. Of course, right? You only increas it. And so you're creating these assets that can
1:39:28
generate more traffic, more leads, more sales over the long term. So that's basically how it works. And so let me
1:39:34
break down exactly how it go. We've published over 300 posts. We get like thousands and thousands of visitors and
1:39:40
we use AI free tools and you can automate this. And the great thing about this is you don't need to be technical.
1:39:45
You don't need a website. You don't need any visitors. And Google is literally just giving Reddit posts page one rankings right now. It's absolutely
1:39:51
insane. In fact, Reddit threads appear in 82% of Google searches on page one. I think most people don't realize that,
1:39:57
but just read that again. Reddit threads appear in 82% of Google searches on page
1:40:03
one. That is insane. And most people have no idea this is happening. So, let me show you the system of how this
1:40:08
works, right? And this is called the Goldie Reddit parasite engine. It's my personal framework for turning Reddit into a 3D generation machine. Reddit
1:40:14
parasite engine. The difference between Reddit and why you should do it now is like Google signed a deal with Reddit.
1:40:20
Actually, chat GPT as well have leveraged this too. And so, Google gets access to Reddit's content to join its
1:40:25
AI models. So, Reddit gets boosted in the search results. And the result is Reddit actually saw 27% increase in
1:40:31
ranking keywords. They added 110 million new keywords to their arsenal. And Reddit has a domain rating, domain
1:40:37
authority of 91. That's higher than Fortune 500 websites, right? So, when you post on Reddit, you borrowing their
1:40:42
authority. Your post can rank faster than a brand new website ever could. I've tested myself and I've shown you the proof already. This works, right?
1:40:48
That's basically how it goes. I've given you a bunch of prompts here for example, but what you can actually do is you could use claw to actually generate
1:40:55
names for your subreddit. But the the first place to start is to really go to subreddits and create a new subreddit
1:41:00
like you can see here. Right? So for example, we created the AI SEO insider and that is a subreddit where we post
1:41:06
all of our content. Right now from there you want to pick a niche specific name. So for example, we've used AI SEO
1:41:12
insider. If you're in the e-commerce niche, you might use e-commerce growth hacks. If you were in the local business
1:41:17
niche, you might use like local business AI, right? And you can actually use this prompt on Claude to come up with a bunch of names. From there, you want to start
1:41:24
using the content engine. Now, you can use something like Claude. I would actually recommend Claude for creating content. And all you would do, right, is
1:41:31
you would plug in like a social media post or video transcript, etc. into Claude, as you can see, and you just
1:41:36
paste the content in right there. So, as an example of that, if I go over to YouTube here, and if I open this up,
1:41:43
this YouTube video, and then we'll pull in the transcript from the page. All right. And then we'll take that, we go
1:41:49
back to Reddit, paste in the content, and see pasted content attached. We've taken the YouTube transcript. And now
1:41:55
what we're actually going to do is get this to turn it into content for our subreddit. You would actually customize
1:42:00
your subreddit right here. But you can see how you can easily generate using that video transcript an article based
1:42:06
on that content. And because we're using our own content to generate the article, well, it actually uses that first person
1:42:12
perspective, right? Because it's all trained on our case study data and everything else. And there you can see the article right there, right? And
1:42:17
that's basically how it works. That's what we do. We rinse and repeat it. Sometimes we just post YouTube, sometimes we post full articles, etc.
1:42:23
But it is responsible for generating a large amount of traffic. We actually measured how many clicks we get from Reddit as well. And it is a decent
1:42:30
percentage as well. And the other cool thing is like it actually compounds over time, right? So, if you actually look at our traffic month on month, January, we
1:42:36
didn't get anything. That's when we started. February, we barely got anything. It's a slow burner, right? It took a long time to start getting
1:42:42
traction, but it compounds over time. And now you can see we're up to the point where we're just getting 70,000 views per month on this platform. And it
1:42:49
works really well. We're at over a quarter million views this year, 3,800 members, etc. All right. So, if we have
1:42:55
a look at the past 30 days, 70,000 views on that content, which is insane. That is insane considering this is free. And
1:43:02
so with a combination of your website, Reddit, you can use LinkedIn, etc. It's quite easy to start generating a lot of
1:43:08
content and then also ranking it. And as long as you quality control it before you publish it, you're good to go. So, if you want all the video notes from
1:43:13
today, you can get that, including some example prompts and everything else. I've actually given you a 30-day plan to really follow this step by step. The
1:43:20
main thing to note here is you're not spamming, you're not creating spammy content. You're creating quality content, checking it before you publish
1:43:26
it. And then you can publish this and rank it across your own subreddit and then generate an asset that actually
1:43:31
pulls in leads, pulls in new members, etc., right? And also giving you some ideas of like builds. You could actually
1:43:36
build for example like you could actually get uh Claude to create like a visual dashboard of everything that you're doing today along with a Claude
1:43:42
Reddit response bar, right? For example, you could actually create something that monitors your subreddit, or you could
1:43:48
just paste in the responses on the subreddit and get it to automatically answer community questions and that sort
1:43:53
of thing. All right. The old way of getting traffic was like you would build a website from scratch, wait 12 months
1:43:59
for Google to trust you, write like a 100 blog posts manually, build backlinks one by one, compete against massive
1:44:04
sites, pay for ads to get any attention, hire writers or spend hours creating content, and then hope Google doesn't
1:44:10
penalize you. That was the old way of getting traffic, right? The new way with this Reddit method is that you can
1:44:15
create a subreddit in 60 seconds. You borrow Reddit's authority, which is insanely high. You let Claude write all
1:44:21
your content. You automate the posting with free tools. You rank within hours, not months. Zero ad spend required. No
1:44:27
technical skills needed. And Google is literally pushing Reddit content to page one. 82% of all searches have a Reddit
1:44:34
thread on the first page, right? And so, this isn't about working harder. It's about working smarter and just using tools that exist right now that most
1:44:40
people don't know. I think that's the game in 2026 and the winners will use AI and the losers will do everything
1:44:46
manually. So the question is which one are you? Now let me break some limiting beliefs that might be holding you back because I know what you're thinking.
1:44:51
You're probably thinking I need to get a good writer to create content. Here's the thing, right? So if you look at for
1:44:57
example like Richard Branson, he's dyslexic. He can't write, right? But he's built a billion dollar empire. And
1:45:02
how has he done that? He surrounds himself with people and tools that do what he can't. And Claude actually writes better than most humans. He
1:45:09
writes in your voice. He writes on any topic, it never gets writer's block. You don't need to be a good writer essentially, right? You just need to be
1:45:15
a good editor. Read what Claude creates. Fix what needs fixing. Publish it. Boom. You're done. And so the new empowering
1:45:21
belief with SEO is really I'm the creative director and AI is my writing team. Other people say SEO takes too
1:45:27
long. I don't have the patience for it. And I get it. Traditional SEO might take 6 to 12 months. And that's brutal. But
1:45:33
Reddit parasite SEO is pretty different. So I've ranked keywords in 24 hours, not 24 months. And why is that? is because
1:45:38
you're borrowing Reddit's authority. Google already trusts Reddit. So when you post, Google trusts you instantly. And this is the shortcut. This is a
1:45:45
hack. This is what everyone's been waiting for. So the new empowering belief really is like I can rank fast by
1:45:50
borrowing authority from platforms Google already trusts. And finally, like people say Reddit is for nerd, Reddit is
1:45:56
for memes, etc. It won't work for my business. Reddit actually has over 108 million daily active users, right? Two
1:46:03
billion monthly visits. There's a subreddit for literally everything, right? real estate, B2B software, fitness coaching, digital marketing,
1:46:09
whatever you do, right? Your customers are probably on Reddit right now asking questions, looking for solutions. So, you just need to be there. And bear in
1:46:15
mind, you don't just get the traffic from Google and AI search engines. We also get the traffic directly from Reddit's platform, which is very
1:46:21
powerful, too. The new empowering belief really is like my ideal customers are already on Reddit. I just need to show
1:46:27
up and help them. Okay, so that's basically how it works. I've given you the 30-day plan, all the prompts, case studies showing and proving that it
1:46:33
works. And you can see all the strategies that we've talked about today. Glenn says, "Happy New Year, brother. Thanks for the videos. Happy D.
1:46:39
Great to see you and happy new year." And essentially, that's how we get so much views in just 30 days. Using Reddit
1:46:46
AI SEO, it's very powerful. Most people are not leveraging it properly. We're creating really good content. I myself
1:46:52
and my team spend a lot of time creating this content, but with AI, we can really scale it and we can really get good
1:46:57
results, and that's what we're working towards. So, thanks so much for watching. If you want to get all the video notes from today, the prompts, the

Creating SEO Optimized Content with Claude
1:48:15
Claude. And Claude is one of the most powerful and sentient ways to write content in 2026. I really call Claude
1:48:21
the depth engine because chat GPT is like really good for quick tasks. Gemini is great for research etc. But Claude
1:48:28
goes deep. It understands context like no other AI. It remembers what you told it 50 messages ago. It creates content
1:48:34
that actually sounds human. And that's why I built this workflow around it. Okay. So you can see here for example
1:48:39
this website went from what two clicks a day all the way up to 176 clicks a day. And the trajectory of that website is
1:48:45
really nice as you can see. So the way that we're doing this is basically we use this prompt to generate content. So
1:48:52
you can see over here if we take this SEO optimize prompt as you can see this is actually from the AI profit boardroom
1:48:58
community that I run and if we plug in our keyword so for example let's say our keyword is like SEO training Japan and
1:49:04
we've got some context about who we are what we do etc where we want to funnel traffic to. We've got the links right
1:49:10
there and then we can click enter and that will actually create an SEO optimized article much more likely to
1:49:16
rank. Okay, Don Morel here. Ready to learn, my man. Thank you very much for joining, Don. Appreciate you. We're
1:49:21
going to keep generating this. See, you can see how it's beginning to create the content. Now, one of the best things
1:49:26
about Claude, if we have a look at that website that's ranking really right now, just to analyze, reverse engineer what's actually working. If you go to the blog
1:49:32
here, you can see some examples of the content we've created, right? So, basically, if we're targeting like the
1:49:38
keyword rank with notebook or notebook SEO, etc. What we're going to do is put that inside the title. And then we have
1:49:44
the introduction, a video that basically talks about the same topic and is semantically related. We have links to
1:49:50
our funnels to funnel traffic to it. And then we have a breakdown throughout the page of exactly what we're covering, including some FAQs at the end. Right?
1:49:57
And you'll see that Claude is beginning to create this inside artifacts and it will generate the content. Now, we just
1:50:04
consistently publish content around low competition keywords throughout the page and just typically we'll take all of our
1:50:10
videos and then turn them into video transcripts, right? For example, if I type in, I don't know, notebook SEO onto
1:50:16
Google, what you're going to see here is my website ranks, but also a lot of my videos rank as well. So, you can see
1:50:22
here, one, two, three, four different videos ranking on the first page of Google for that particular keyword.
1:50:28
another video right there. And then we've got another article right there that's ranking for this keyword, right?
1:50:34
A bunch of shorts, which is pretty crazy as well, right? So, basically what I'm showing you here is you can dominate the
1:50:39
first page of Google pretty quickly and easily for that particular keyword just using these methods. Now, one thing I
1:50:45
haven't actually checked for this particular keyword is where we are ranking inside perplexity and other AI
1:50:50
search engines. Type in how to do notebook LM SEO. Now obviously people aren't going to be typing in that sort
1:50:55
of keyword directly but they will be typing around stuff like that and AI search particularly it goes so deep that
1:51:01
it will find many different angles to show you in your content right so if we have a look at this particular keyword
1:51:07
what you can see is it's reviewed the sources right and if we have a look at this one where's that source it from so
1:51:13
that is an article from LinkedIn we've got an article from my website julianold.co.uk Okay, inside there. What
1:51:19
else have we got? We have a YouTube video of mine in the top 10. So, that's one of my videos. And then also, let's
1:51:25
have a look here. Oh, we also have a Reddit article ranking inside Claude as well, right inside Perplexi, sorry. So,
1:51:31
you can see how you're ranking. And we are ranking multiple times for this keyword. We actually show up number one right there for this particular keyword.
1:51:37
And with a combination of YouTube videos plus taking that YouTube content, those transcripts and then plugging them into
1:51:44
a tool like Claude, it's quite easy to rank inside these AI search engines. I think everyone's worried that SEO
1:51:50
doesn't work anymore or it's harder to get traffic from Google. I think honestly if you have the right strategies, you can rank more times
1:51:57
inside the top 10 rankings. Look at us ranking right here. Here we go. One, two,
1:52:03
three, four, four different. Let's have a look at this one. Yeah, we got four different
1:52:08
articles or pieces of content ranking in the top 10 for that particular keyword. And then if you have a look at Google
1:52:15
itself, we're ranking one, two, three, four, five, let's have a look. Six times
1:52:21
on the first page of Google plus our shorts. So 10 times on the first page of Google there. So we got four shorts
1:52:26
ranking on Google for that keyword, right? And so it's just it it's almost getting easier to do SEO if you know the
1:52:33
right strategies. And that's what I'm showing you today, right? And so most people use Claude like a fancy search
1:52:39
engine. Ask a question, get an answer, move on. But that's like buying a Ferrari and only driving it to the grocery store. You're missing 90% of its
1:52:46
power. So the real magic happens when you give Claude context about your business, trade it on your voice, and
1:52:51
use it as a thinking partner and not just a tool. Right? So what we got here, for example, Don says, "I'm getting it.
1:52:57
How will this method work with barber shops and hair salons? Absolutely. We actually have a lot of clients who are
1:53:02
local businesses and some of them are hair salons and that sort of thing. So, I want to show you some examples of how you can do this using your business,
1:53:09
right? And if you have the name of your business as well, I can even do it for you and create an article for you right now just to show you an example. In the
1:53:15
meantime, I'll just show you some examples how you can do the keyword research. Miguel says, "Can you help me?" Absolutely. Feel free to post any
1:53:21
questions. Always happy to help. And then Don, if you want to post what your website is as well, I can actually work
1:53:26
on creating some content for you and showing you your process. In the meantime, I'll just go off and do some random keyword research for a barber
1:53:33
anyway. Right? So, if we say for example, barber New York, right? Something like that, right? Relatively
1:53:39
medium keyword to rank for. So, there is some competition for that keyword. What I would typically do is just go for
1:53:44
keywords that are low competition like you can see here. So, for example, like KD10 and below is perfect, right? So if
1:53:50
we have a look at the keywords down here for example what we got best barber New York that's a pretty easy keyword to
1:53:56
rank for very easy high traffic potential boom we could go for that right so how are we going to do that
1:54:02
what we would do here is we're going to start a new chat and then we're going to take that particular prompt that we took
1:54:07
earlier we're going to go over to Claude here we're going to plug in the keyword for example if we found an easy keyword like best barber New York we're going to
1:54:13
plug that into the keyword section and then we can start creating the content now of course what you also want to do
1:54:19
is just change this so that you have your actual website and everything else ready to go inside here. So, what you
1:54:24
would do, for example, I'm going to open up a new tab and we'll create a sample like this, but for a barbershop. So, I'm
1:54:30
going to type this in. I'm going to say rewrite this as dummy text for a
1:54:35
barbershop in New York plus customized to a barbershop website instead. Right?
1:54:41
And basically what I can do is just get some dummy source context. I can plug into the prompt and show you the outputs
1:54:46
in a second. So, we'll wait for that to load. And you can see here, for example, okay, Marcus Williams, he owns Blade and
1:54:52
Fade Barershop in Brooklyn, blah blah blah. Here's the pages he wants to direct traffic to. Right? So, what we
1:54:58
can do is take that source context, like you can see, we can plug it into this source context section. So, we're going
1:55:03
to say create an SEO optimized article for this keyword equals this. Is the source context about me? Blah blah blah.
1:55:08
And then we'll hit enter, right? And so, we've found the keyword research. That is critical. You really want to find
1:55:13
easy keywords you can go after. And the easier they are, the easier it's going to be to rank. If you can find those KD
1:55:19
zeros or those KD5s, etc. on Adris, you're already winning. That's actually the first thing we do for clients as
1:55:24
soon as they sign up to our service is like we make sure they get some easy keywords to rank for. And now you can see we're beginning to create the
1:55:30
content. And it's going to start creating the content as you can see. So we'll wait for that to load. But you can see how that's just going off creating
1:55:37
the content building it out. Now if you actually want to have a look at how we've written this, we said making sure it's easy to read, conversational, UK
1:55:43
grammar, FAQs, headers, etc. probably would change that to US grammar. Honestly, first person is pretty good
1:55:49
and then we've done the rest, right? And now you can begin to see that it's actually working. It's actually creating content. So that's basically how the
1:55:56
whole process works. Now we'll come up to the finalized output in the end. But that's essentially how you can do this.
1:56:01
And what you can also do is you can create a clawed project and then that's pre-tored with your writing
1:56:06
instructions. So for example, if you go to the project section here, we've actually got like a project for writing
1:56:12
tweets, a project for writing live stream notes, right? We also got an offer builder. So this helps me generate
1:56:18
new offers for the AR profit boarding my SEO services. Also have all these different ones. Now the main point here
1:56:24
is like you can easily create a new project, plug in the prompt that we were talking about earlier and then it can
1:56:30
create content in your style that actually ranks every time and you just plug it in the content, right? And bear in mind like your content is not going
1:56:36
to rank every time. Just to be clear here is the more content you create, the more opportunities you have to rank. So for us, like we'll create content every
1:56:42
single day. We know some of it's going to rank. We know some of it's not going to rank. We know some of it's going to rank in 6 months, maybe 12 months. And
1:56:48
that's okay, right? We'll play the long game. We want to rank for decades, not for weeks or days. And that's
1:56:53
essentially how we're doing this for this website, right? And bear in mind, like before we started doing this, we were getting like three clicks a day.
1:57:00
Now we're getting 176 clicks a day. And that's growing, right? 76 * 30 that is
1:57:06
5,280 traffic per month for free. If we times that by 12 that's 63,000 people
1:57:12
that find our website every year for free directly from Google let alone all the AI search and everything else and
1:57:17
all the other content publish as well across multiple platforms like for example Reddit very powerful strategy
1:57:23
and Claude helps you automate pretty much all of that. So thanks so much for watching. What I've actually done is I
1:57:28
have plugged in the strategy that we've talked about today. I've actually created the depth SEO blueprint inside
1:57:35
the free video notes, some example prompt seekers. I've given you a 30-day plan as well. If we have a look at Claude here, it's generated the article
1:57:42
for the barberh shop now. So, if we have a look at this, let's see what we got. There we go. So, we've got the article. As you can see, we can actually save
1:57:48
that to drive if you want into Google Drive. And you can see the content is good to go, right? And that's targeting
1:57:53
the keyword New York barber shop, right? Best barber New York. That's the one, right? And then you can see it's
1:57:58
optimizing it in the title, the first line, etc. And yeah, that's how we generate the content itself. Now, if you
1:58:04
go back to this as well, some people going to say, well, AI content doesn't rank on Google. The new empowering belief is like AI assisted content
1:58:10
ranks, right? Pure AI garbage, of course, it doesn't rank, right? There's a big difference here. If you say, "Hey,
1:58:16
chat GBT, write me a blog post about dog training." That's there's a huge difference between that and saying,
1:58:21
"Hey, using Claude with brand context, your expertise, your examples, and your editing." Google's much more likely to
1:58:27
rank that, right? It doesn't penalize AI content. They just penalize bad content. And bad content is generic, unhelpful,
1:58:33
thin, and copied from everywhere else. Good content is specific to your audience, genuinely helpful, comprehensive, and has unique
1:58:39
perspective. And Claude helps you create content faster. That's it. Good content faster. All right. Other people say, I
1:58:45
need to write everything myself to maintain quality. I would say the new empowering belief really is like the best content is AI drafted and human
1:58:52
refined, right? So, for example, like Muhammad Ali didn't become the greatest by training alone. He had trainers,
1:58:57
coaches, spiring partners, and they helped him become better than he could have done alone. And Claude is your content training partner. It drafts, you
1:59:04
refine, it suggests, you decide, it does heavy lifting, you add the expertise, and the result is you get better content in less time. And that's not cheating.
1:59:10
That's just smart training, right? So, feel free to get the video notes from today. Inside the AI success lab, we also got a 30-day plan on exactly how to
1:59:17
set this up. And what also included here is all the notes from today and all the prompts. And that's inside the AI
1:59:24
success lab which comes with a community of 42,400 members. If you go inside the passive here, you can get everything
1:59:29
from today inside this section. Today I'm going to show you how to do AI SEO in 2026. This is based on what's working
Using GLM 4.7 for AI SEO
1:59:37
for me. So I'm just going to share the tactics that's working for me right now. You can see, for example, this website
1:59:43
is at zero or three clicks a day and it's gone all the way up to 176 clicks
1:59:48
per day. And this is free traffic from Google, let alone all the other traffic that it gets from other AI search
1:59:53
engines by ranking. This is for juliancoldi.com, which is my agency's website. And what we're going to kick it off with is this AI agent called GLM
2:00:02
4.7. And GLM 4.7 basically is like a Chinese AI agent. You can use it for free and that's one of the benefits for
2:00:08
this because you can use it for actually creating the content, but you can also generate different tools that will help
2:00:13
you rank your content and also automate SEO itself. So, we're going to get straight into this. So, I'm going to
2:00:18
show you some of my best techniques for using this. Um, and if you've never used GLM 4.7 or if you need a full guide or
2:00:25
anything like that, actually going to walk you through some of the video notes we have today. So, what we actually have is a bunch of resources inside the AI
2:00:32
success lab which comes with all my best trainings, a community of 42,400 people. We also have, for example, a complete
2:00:38
masterass on how to do ISO and one of the modules that we're covering today is GLM 4.7. So, you know, in the next few
2:00:45
minutes, you're going to learn how to set up GLM 4.7, even if you don't speak Chinese. It is a Chinese AI, but it's
2:00:51
all in English. Click automation, the greatest SEO content, how to connect this to your existing workflows, why
2:00:56
this free tool is outperforming many paid alternatives in the 30-day plan to get this running inside your business.
2:01:01
All right, so the concept here is that what most people get wrong about AICO is that they think more tools equals better
2:01:08
results. And it's wrong. It's like going to the gym and using every single machine for 2 minutes each. That would get you nowhere. So instead you need one
2:01:14
powerful workflow that does the heavy lifting and GLM 4.7 is one of the best ways to do it. All right. So what I've
2:01:20
actually done for example and this is something I can use for creating content is I can use a pro like this and we can
2:01:26
copy and paste this one. Here we go. And I've actually used it over here. So all you do is you plug in your keyword like
2:01:31
you can see you say you are my SEO content assistant. Create a compelling headline 1,500 word blog post. Include
2:01:38
five subheadings. Add a met description blah blah blah. And here's my keyword. Right? And what it actually do is gen
2:01:43
this AI SEO article. As you can see, it's pretty simple to do. So, here's a headline, here's a meta description,
2:01:48
here's the information. Some of it you're going to cut off obviously like that, right? But basically, that's basically how it works. And it's quite
2:01:54
simple and easy to generate that content. It is simple to do and literally it's just a one-click sort of
2:02:00
automation. I would always recommend editing the content before you publish it, of course. But if you want tips on
2:02:06
that, inside the AI success lab, we actually have the Goldilock zone framework, which is a step-by-step
2:02:11
checklist for really just quality controlling your content before you publish it. Always do that, folks. All right, so next thing we're going to test
2:02:17
out is creating a lead magnet, right? And we'll run through some of the best prompts to use this stuff today. For
2:02:23
example, what we can actually do is we can go into GLM 4.7. We can plug in this
2:02:29
prompt, right? So I run a business in and then you just insert your niche. So, I run a business in the SEO industry.
2:02:35
Give me 20 longtail keyword ideas that beginners would search for. Focus on questions and how to phrases format as a
2:02:42
simple list. Right? And basically, what this would do is automatically generate all the keyword research for you. And if
2:02:48
you look at the blogs from this particular website that we're using as a case study, as you can see, basically
2:02:53
the way that we're doing this for Julian.com is if you have a look at the blog here, we're we're using the same
2:02:58
sort of frameworks, right? So, for example, here we're just targeting low competition keywords. We actually embed
2:03:04
the original video. Then we insert links to our funnels for our page to generate more traffic and directed. Bear in mind,
2:03:10
like there's already pop-ups on this website and there's a big button that says free SEO strategy sessions. Quite
2:03:15
often we don't even need to put the links throughout and there's a lead magnet at the top, but that's basically how we do this. All right, if we go back
2:03:21
inside GLM 4.7, you can see that we have a bunch of longtail keywords, right? So, how to do keyword research for free, you
2:03:27
can do it with GLM 4.7, right? And these are all potential keywords and articles that we could write in our niche. And
2:03:32
you could go deeper than that. But that's basically how easy it is. And if you have questions as we go along, feel free to ask. But that's another
2:03:38
automation. So just to recap, we've done the content for the blog post. And we've actually automated finding keywords as
2:03:45
well. Let's keep going through this. Another thing that we could actually start doing, let's have a look through some of these prompts. This is a 30-day
2:03:50
plan that tells you what to implement day by day. If you want to steal this stuff from me, for example, we could actually take our content, right? New
2:03:57
chat here, and we could say, okay, review this content and optimize it for SEO. You paste in your content from the
2:04:03
blog. So, let's say, for example, we'll take the content from this page. Copy that, paste it in, ask it to check for
2:04:09
keyword density, readability, missing sub headlines, opportunities to add relevant keywords, naturally, metad description improvement, and semantic
2:04:15
SEO as well, right? Related keywords. So, we're going to hit enter, and that will actually review our content for us.
2:04:21
So that's another way to really attack your SEO strategy. And bear in mind like GLM 4.7 is free. So you can use it for
2:04:28
free. You can basically create content, do keyword research. You can analyze your existing content to improve it and
2:04:35
use all these different ways to generate better opportunities for SEO. You can see here it's actually doing a final
2:04:40
polish and it's a thinking model as well when it's doing this. Now one of the other opportunities whilst it's doing that in the background, actually it's
2:04:46
finished doing that. So we can refer it. You see here it's actually analyzed like here's the keyword density, the readability, the structure, semantic
2:04:53
SEO, etc. And it's actually rewritten the article with better semantics,
2:04:58
better optimization across the page. I would actually say the formatting looks a lot nicer as well. And actually the
2:05:03
content itself seems a lot nicer. So that's one way to do it as well. And then you can also for example use this
2:05:08
for internal links, FAQ schema, etc. The old way, if we have a look at this, right? The old way was like manually
2:05:14
researching keywords for two hours, manually writing content, manually optimizing everything, manually creating
2:05:21
variations and building the system or buying expensive subscriptions and hiring writers who need constant
2:05:27
management and then hoping the content actually works, right? That's the old way of doing SEO. It was quite a time consuming. If you use something like GLM
2:05:34
4.7 to help you, then you know GLM 4.7 is going to research the keywords for you, write the content, AI optimize it
2:05:40
automatically, create variations on demand if you need to. For example, when we're posting to my website, we'll
2:05:46
actually create another variation and then we'll post that on Reddit as well. And this subreddit also gets a lot of
2:05:53
views, actually gets more views than my actual website, right? So, for example, if we check out this Reddit here, get like 70 views per month using this SEO
2:06:00
content and the optimized content, right? So, when we're doing this, like we can actually repurpose the content across multiple platforms and then, for
2:06:06
example, if you're getting 70,000 views per month on Reddit and then 200 clicks a day on your website or whatever, then
2:06:12
this adds up, right? And it generates a lot of traffic to the funnels you actually want to drive traffic to. And so, you can automate a big part of the
2:06:18
process and it's really simple and easy to do. All right? Now some people say like free AI tools can't compete with
2:06:24
paid ones but I would say the new empowering belief here is like free tools and outperforming paid alternatives on benchmarks and this
2:06:30
actually shocked me day task what is related to how many minutes obsessed with efficiency right when you actually
2:06:35
see GLM 4.7's benchmark scores it actually beats for example chat GPT on coding tasks and when I've tested out
2:06:41
myself here's what I found for SEO content for automations for basic coding this works just as well as chat GPT
2:06:48
that's finding the best Muay Thai gym in Bangkok bulk is free, right? You'd be crazy not to train there. The other thing is some people say AI will make my
2:06:55
content sound robotic, but AI sounds robotic when you give it robotic prompts, right? This is like blaming the
2:07:01
steak for tasted bad when you cooked it wrong. And I love steak. It's my favorite food. So, the problem isn't the AI, the problem is the instructions.
2:07:08
When I write prompts, I include the tone, examples of the reading level of the specific audience, and garbage in,
2:07:14
garbage out. So, great prompts equals great content out. So, that's basically how you can use GLM 4.7. The other
2:07:20
thing, the final thing that you can do is like you can actually create an SEO dashboard whether that's for you or for your agency. So if we have a look at
2:07:26
this prompt for example, you can create these nice little dashboards kind of like a SAS a mini SAS tool here that
2:07:31
stores your data and then you can actually share and export that with people whether that's in your team or your clients if you're running an agency
2:07:37
or just for yourself as well. There's some other cool stuff as well like you can build a task list manager, to-do
2:07:43
list, apps builder and then you can add tasks and track them. So, for example, let's say you needed to optimize the
2:07:48

2:37
I'll let you keep watching. Cheers. All right, we're here. Let's get going. So, I want to teach you how to become a master at SEO. First, I'm going to teach
Becoming a Master at SEO
2:44
you about the principles of ranking on search engines and then actually give you some tangible tips you can implement starting today. And it's going to be a
2:50
long video. It's going to be boring. And the reason why I want to start with the principles is because I need to be able
2:55
to tell you how I think about things and why things work the way they do and giving you a way into my mind to learn
3:02
how I think about this and have critical thinking because my goal is to like have you watch this and then go out on your
3:08
own, right? Because if I just would just talk to you about the tangible tips, right? You'd be kept at what you know,
3:14
right? If I'm teaching you the the thought process and teaching you how to critical think about this marketing
3:19
strategy because SEO is a marketing strategy, right? You'll be able to go so much more beyond. And I now finally over all these years of of like uh teaching
3:26
on YouTube, I understand like this even looks like a university class, but I now understand why teachers like explain to you the concepts because as cliche as it
3:33
sounds, you need to understand the concepts and the reason behind things. Why does this work like this? Why
3:38
doesn't this work like that? So understanding the the nature of things, how they work, and of even like a bit of a tangent right here. Elon Musk talks
3:45
about this, right? Understanding exactly why things work like they work, the core core principles because again, if I
3:51
teach you this, you'll be able to do so much more than if I just went over like some tangible tips. So again, it's going to be long, but I need to to to give you
3:58
and explain to you why things work like they work, my thought process. So then you can like pick put holes in my
4:04
thought process because I do things the way I do because that's what what I know how to do, right? I'm going to teach you what I do and how I do it. But because
4:09
I'm teaching you the critical thinking, the thought process behind all these systems, right? You'll be able to poke holes into my strategies, into my
4:15
thought process, and this is the only way to make make you succeed. Okay? Again, as cliche as crazy as that
4:21
sounds, this is like essential. Okay? So, with that out of the way, right, simply what we're doing is we are doing
How does SEO work
4:28
marketing, right? SEO is a marketing strategy. Search engine optimization is
4:33
the marketing strategy that allows you to rank a site higher on search engines, okay? And make more money out of it. Now
4:39
does more traffic mean more sales? No. Like more traffic
4:44
doesn't mean more money. Okay, this is this is a very key important concept, right? There's a correlation, right? But
4:50
it doesn't mean causation. Okay, there's a correlation. Yes, in theory, the more traffic you get, the more eyeballs, the more money you can make, but it's not a
4:58
onetoone and it's not all the time. Okay, and we need to cover this because it's very important because often times people focus on traffic and traffic can
5:05
be a vanity metric. Okay. Now, what SEO is, as you might know already, you're watching this is you are on a search
5:11
engine. Doesn't matter if it's Google, doesn't matter if it's Bing, doesn't matter if it's Tik Tok, okay, YouTube,
5:17
uh eBay, Amazon, Etsy, right? All these are search engines. These are product based search engines. So, Amazon, Etsy,
5:23
uh eBay, these are product based search engines, okay? Tik Tok, YouTube or yeah, I guess Tik Tok, YouTube, these are
5:29
video based search engines. Okay. Being Google, these are the classic mostly textbased search engines. Sure. When you
5:34
search for something on Google, right, depending on a search query, it might gives you give you the classic 10 links
5:39
or might give you like a video or might give you like um a social. So, it doesn't doesn't it depends on what
5:45
you're searching. These are the more um broader search engines, right? When you search for something on YouTube, you
5:50
only get videos on Google and Bing, not necessarily. And so, now the first concept we need to understand, right, is
Understanding Search Intent
5:55
search intent. Okay? So when someone searches for right let's say the intent
6:01
they have the intent is buying a product right there's multiple intents there's
6:07
buying a product right there's buying a service there's learning right there there's infinite intents okay and so
6:14
when someone searches right for buy um water bottle on Google right what does
6:20
Google give them right they're going to give them if you search for buy water bottle or best water bottle of stainless
6:26
steel on Google right what's going happen is that they're going to give you a bunch of product listings,
6:31
right? B or buy stainless steel water bottle, right? Of course,
6:38
they're going to give you this first, right? Even though these are these are sponsored, right? Mostly it's going to be like product based listings. Okay,
6:45
this first, right? Because it doesn't make sense for them not to do this. If you search, for example, for how to tie a tie, right? The first result is going
6:52
to always be a video, right? video, video, video and uh um written based
6:58
um search right here or result right here. But mostly it's just video like all these is video or image because
7:04
again the search intent behind someone searching for how to tie a tie is to learn how to tie tie and the whole goal
7:10
of these search engines, right? The goal goal of these right is to give users two things. First is what they want and then
7:16
the fastest they can. For example, if you type in how tal is the Eiffel Tower,
7:21
Google's going to just give you right here because again, Google what they want, all the search engines, what they want is giving you the correct information the fastest they can. So
7:29
this stuff right here, it makes sense they do it. It's not necessarily it's not necessarily, excuse me, that they're
7:34
selling traffic from you. I mean, they are, but the whole goal, their business model is is to become um is to be is to
7:40
provide the most valuable value for the users. That's the whole goal of of of product. Google is a product, right? So it doesn't make sense for them to rank a
7:46
blog for post first because they can just give you the info like this. That's why uh LLM search engines like HPT are
7:52
very popular because when your search query is conversational, right? Um I'm
7:59
Portuguese. I have a company in the US. How do I pay taxes if I make 100K a year
8:08
and have one child? So this stuff right here, Google's never going to be able to give you a tailored answer for this,
8:14
right? So the info they give you, it's not great and you have to click around and and investigate the stuff for you.
8:20
That's why engines like Shetch GPD are great for more of these um complex queries. Again, the whole goal of these
8:25
engines is to give you the best answer that satisfies your search intent the fastest. Okay. And so now going back
8:32
here to intent, the reason why I talk about this is because depending on the keywords, and we'll touch on keywords, but depending on the keywords you want
8:38
to rank for, right, you need to produce content that satisfies that intent. Okay? If you want to rank for the
8:44
keyword how to tie a tie, well, go on these search engines, see what the search engine search engine is valuing
8:50
for this search query, and produce better content. So it would be dumb of you for this query to produce a a blog
8:58
post, right? or create it like a product page because Google wants to give the
9:03
info to their users as fast as possible and what it's valing right here is videos right video video
9:10
video image okay so depending on your search query you have to see right you
9:16
can either you could just search right here or think right for yourself what would be based on my search query the best form to deliver this information to
9:24
the user in other words what would be the best form to satisfy the user search intent the fastest Okay, that's the
9:30
concept that needs to be ingrained in your mind. Okay, because you can have the best blog post explaining how to tie
9:35
a tie, but if that's not the best way in which users can consume information, right, and satisfy their search intent
9:41
the fastest, you'll never rank, right? And a great example of this is if you search for uh dog or excuse me, if you
9:48
search for uh buy a buy a or buy a car in Los Angeles, right? The only stuff
9:53
that's going to show up, right, it's car resellers or whatever. never it's never going to show like a a link for a dog
10:00
grooming service, right? Because again, Google wants to satisfy the user search intent. So if they search for car buying or car leasing, you're never going to
10:07
have a link for a dog grooming service because this doesn't satisfy the search intent. And and I know this sounds basic, but these concepts are very
10:13
important to understand. You got to satisfy the search intent. Okay, that's the first thing. Now, what do you do
Finding your SEO keywords (Keyword Matrix)
10:20
still tied in with search? Let me just change the color of this to black so it's easier to to see, right? what you
10:26
have to do when you are um thinking about the keywords you want to rank for. Sure, we we can talk about
10:32
tools later on. You can talk about all this stuff, but you right, you as the business owner, you know better than anyone else, right? What your products
10:38
are are, excuse me, and what your customer pain points are, right? You you know know better you know better than me, excuse me, and you know better than
10:44
any any AI or any tool out there. You as a business owner, you know what you're selling, what the pain points you're
10:49
solving and who your customer is, right? If for example, you are a plastic surgeon, right? you know, like your
10:55
target audience, you know, like audience, you know, their pain points, okay? Maybe they uh they feel they're
11:01
they're like ugly. They feel like they I don't know. You get the point, right? You know their pain points and you know
11:06
who what you're selling. You know who you're selling it to better than anyone
11:13
else. And so based on this, right, you got to be able to understand what uh
11:19
their potential search queries would be on search engines, right? And again, you
11:24
can use tools, you can use anything you want, but I'd say the very first step before like uh investing in tools and
11:30
all this stuff is just you sit down, make a list of the keywords you think people wanting to buy your products or
11:36
services would search for on Google being Chet, etc. Okay? And after that, you can use tools. Of course, those are also valuable to to find new keywords
11:43
that you thought maybe nobody searched for them, but actually people are searching for them. For example, I don't know, um plastic surgery
11:51
uh complication complications for women. I don't know, right? You get the point, right? There
11:57
there may be some keywords where you don't think about them like off the top of your mind, but that there might be some search volume for. Now, there's a
12:03
free tool for this. Google keyword planner. It's free, right? Don't need to spend thousands of dollars on other
12:08
tools. is free and gives you the the search data for a bunch of keywords. Okay. Now, there's more expensive tools like Adrafts where they have have a bit
12:16
more data and they allow you to explore more stuff. For example, if I go here to keyword explorer and just searching for
12:21
uh plastic surgery, right? It allows me to
12:26
uh like go down and for example plastic surgery and then right, I don't know, it
12:31
allows me to to find keywords and more opportunities that maybe I I wouldn't have thought about them. Okay. But the
12:37
very first step should be like you sit down and make a list of um of keywords,
12:42
right? And once you have a list of your keywords, right, we need to do draw out this graph, right? Where in the x-axis
12:48
we have traffic. And usually higher higher the traffic, the higher the competition. And in the y- axis we
12:54
have the buying intent. And I'll I'll tell you why this is important, right?
13:00
And this ties in with the stuff that I said to you in the beginning that traffic doesn't necessarily mean more money. Hey, it's me again. Just want to
13:06
remind you that I have this done for you service where I will do your SEO for you. Again, like I said before, I
13:12
guarantee a 25% increase in organic search traffic over 90 to 180 days or
13:18
you don't pay. So, I'll come in. I understand who your customer is is, excuse me, what their pain points are,
13:23
what's your competitors, what you sell, etc. And build this tailored SEO strategy that will get you more traffic
13:29
guaranteed. Okay? Whether that's through building backlinks or building blog pages or building feature pages or optimizing or excuse me optimizing what
13:36
you already have in place, right? Optimizing your schema markup your technical off on page. I'll just grow
13:42
your business as if it was my business. Okay? So, it's a fully done for you hands-off service where I'll come in and
13:47
guarantee 25% more traffic. So, again, it's going to be the very first link in the description. Check it out if you want. If not, I'll let you keep
13:52
watching. Cheers. Because, right, let me give you an example. Let's say I have a
Visualizing buying intent (example)
13:58
store, a physical store, right, where we sell phone repairs, okay? We sell phone
14:05
repairs, okay? And people, yes, some people come in organic organically through the door when they're passing by. But some of them, right, we want to
14:11
we want to expand our our revenue. So, we maybe we have a website, of course, right? And traffic comes into the
14:17
website, whether that's from Google or Bing or other search engines or even or or even paid ads, okay, they come to the site. So, before they come into the
14:23
store, they come into the website first. Now, our site can rank first for keywords like how to repair an iPhone 16
14:31
or it can also rank for keywords like how much does it cost to
14:38
repair an iPhone 16 or where to
14:44
repair an iPhone 16. Now, these are two
14:49
very different intents when it comes to these queries. So let's assume the
14:55
keyword how to repair an iPhone 16 has 10,000 searches per month right and these two how and where excuse me how
15:01
much sorry um and where have only 1k okay this is just for demonstrational purposes right uh it would be much more
15:08
valuable to rank our site for these keywords than for this one. Why? Well because the buying intent behind a
15:16
keyword like how much or where is way way higher than someone searching for how. Someone searching for how most
15:22
likely wants to do it themselves while someone searching for where or how much. Well, most likely they're looking for someone to do it for them. Now, granted,
15:29
of course, you can still convert some of these people. For example, let's say you have a page on your site that rank for
15:34
how to repair an iPhone. That's this beautiful page, right? With amazing title, even a video, step-by-step video,
15:39
right? A step one, boom, a step two. So, super broken down, right? With an FAQ at
15:45
the bottom, like amazing page that if people actually read it, they can actually fix their iPhone for them. Um that said right and again you can rank
15:51
this pa you can um rank this page and you can also say at the bottom hey listen this is very hard why not just
15:56
come into our store give us a call and we'll fix it for you. So yes you can convert some of these people right into
16:02
coming in to your store eventually but it just takes much more time maybe like you have to nurture them with an email sequence maybe they have to call you. So
16:09
it does take time but it's way way easier just to go for the keywords with high buying intent. They have less
16:14
traffic most of the times right? So they're easier to rank and the conversion rates are much higher. This is what I mean by more traffic doesn't
16:20
mean more sales because it's not about the traffic, it's about the buying intent. This is the most important thing
16:25
about your keywords, right? You can have a billion in monthly organic search traffic, but if nobody is buying from you, it's pointless. And you see this
16:32
all all the every single every single every single excuse me, everyone like a lot of people suffer from this even our own business. And so what does this mean
16:40
about on this uh keyword matrix? Well, you make a list of your keywords and you put them right scattered throughout this
16:46
um matrix, right? According with the buying intent and the competition, okay? And then you don't target keywords here
16:53
nor here, right? Why? Because these two quadrants have low buying intent, right? This one has low buying intent and high
16:59
competition. So, not only are these hard keywords to rank for, but even if you rank for them, the likelihood of them
17:06
becoming a a conversion or a buyer, I guess, is way way lower than on this one
17:11
and this one, right? These two quadrants have high buying intent. High buying intent, low traffic. High buying intent, high traffic, high competition. So
17:18
again, it's way way better to target multiple keywords here than a couple here. Okay, this is the most important
17:24
thing I see a lot of people fail is they focus too much on traffic and they don't understand the concept of the intent.
17:31
And that's why all these theories important. You need to understand the intent behind someone's search. You need to understand that search engines want
17:38
to provide people uh people with info the fastest they can and the most accurate they can based on their intent
17:44
based on intent of the search and you want to capture as highest of buying intent of that search as you possibly
17:49
can. And so now, of course, after you have the keywords you want to rank for, right, it's time to produce content that
17:55
satisfies the intent behind those keywords because again, search engines are where people are searching for these
18:02
keywords, the keywords you just uh said, right? Wrote down, excuse me. And so now you have to be able to produce content
18:09
that satisfies the those keyword search intent so that these search engines provide people with said content. Now
18:16
that content can be videos, can be written text, right? can be a product page, right? It doesn't doesn't matter
18:21
for now. Okay? The content you're going to be able be producing doesn't matter for now, right? You just have to understand that okay, now after the very
18:27
first step is done, it's time to start giving search engines content that satisfies a search intent for these
18:34
keywords so that when someone searches for these keywords on these search engines, these search engines can take your content and give it to people
18:41
because you you have the best content that satisfies their search intent. Hopefully, this made sense, but we'll circle back to this later on. Now the
18:47
next step of this it's maybe going to be a step backwards is understanding the three main pillars of SEO okay we have
The three main pillars of SEO
18:54
on page SEO right we have off-page SEO okay and we have technical SEO okay
19:02
these are the main three pillars of SEO and you can't succeed you cannot succeed in the SEO space without without all
19:08
three right in other words it's quite difficult to get more traffic to your site by ranking higher without nailing all these three pillars down now what
19:15
does this all mean. So what's on page? On page is everything that happens that
On-page SEO
19:22
happens on your site. Okay, it's the name, right? On page, everything happens on your site. So the content you
19:28
produce, whether that's for like a blog page or your homepage or your services page or product pages, the copy that's
19:34
on there, the keywords that are on there, the way it's written, why it's written that way, the the number of
19:39
times you add images, you add videos, you add your your keywords, where you add your keywords. So the content that's written on your site, any page on your
19:46
site, okay, that's on page. Everything happens on your site. Okay? Then and we'll expand on all these, don't worry.
Off-page SEO
19:51
Then we have off- page. Off- page essentially is backlinks, right? What's a backlink? Well, pretty
19:57
straightforward. Let's say this is my website, right? And we have a page.
20:03
Let's say, for example, my website is about it's a dog grooming business. Okay? And let's say, for example, we
20:09
have a link from uh BBC. BBC wrote an article about the best dog grooming businesses and products and in that
20:15
article they linked to us. Right? This is a backlink, right? Maybe Wikipedia links to us. Okay? Maybe a one of the
20:23
most famous dog food businesses link to us to recommend our services. These are all backlinks. Okay? And why are they
20:30
important? Well, because these act as trust signals, okay? So, because Google
20:35
trusts BBC, right? Because Google trusts this blog, because Google trusts Wikipedia, all these notorious brands,
20:40
right? If they trust them and if they rank their own pages, right? What happens is that when they see that these
20:46
trustworthy sources in their eyes linking to you, they'll view as view you, excuse me, as a trustworthy source
20:52
too. It's as if you were recommending a friend to for to someone else, right?
20:58
That someone else because it's coming from you, a person they trust, right? They know that your recommendation is of
21:03
value. Okay? Again, you cannot succeed in SEO with all these three pillars because if you if you're linking if
21:09
you're getting back links to a page that doesn't satisfy the search intent, this page will never rank. But if you're able
21:14
to combine great onpage content with amazing backlinks, it's the very first
21:20
step to ranking very high. Again, we'll cover how to build links, don't worry. Okay? But off-page SEO is basically
21:26
about link building. Now, there's a bunch of nuance to how many links you should be building, how fast you should be building links, what's a good link,
21:32
right? metrics, traffic, drur uh niche down, we we'll cover all that, don't
21:37
worry. And then we have technical SEO, which is as important. And so what is technical SEO? Well, this is the boring
Technical SEO
21:42
part of SEO. It's your meta titles, your meta descriptions. Okay, we'll cover all this, don't worry. Meta descriptions,
21:48
your uh schema markup, your site speed, your internal linking structure, etc.
21:54
So, all the boring stuff about SEO, the technical parts of it, which are as important. Let me give you an example, right? You can have the best on page in
22:01
the world, the best off page in the world, but if your site takes 10 seconds to load, well, one, it's never going to
22:07
really rank, and two, even if it does, people click on it, it just takes so much time to load. Well, just they're
22:13
just going to like go back and click the second result, even if you're ranking first, right? For example, metat
22:18
descriptions. Let's just do for example, um plumber Dallas. Okay? Right? Uh this
22:23
guy, for example, can be ranking first higher than this one. But if this meta title right here is more enticing than
22:31
this one, well, I might click this one first. So, you got to optimize the metatitles in the description both for
22:36
SEO, so you have to sprinkle in your keywords in there like here, plumber, Dallas, Dallas, right? But also for
22:41
click rate, for CTR, meaning you need to make it as enticing as you can. And here's another
22:48
example for local businesses, for example, right? What other people what some people do is they add their phone number to the meta title. For example,
22:54
right here, these guys. So these guys might get less clicks than these ones, but because they have their number here
23:00
where people are people people are just picking up their phone and just calling without even clicking the site. So that that can happen. Now I wouldn't say this
23:05
is a very smart thing to do because if Google sees that nobody's clicking your site, right? Google doesn't know people
23:11
are calling the number, right? They just know that they aren't clicking your site. So if if people if you're ranking
23:16
second and people like don't click your site over and over again, well, Google will think, okay, maybe this is not a
23:21
very good good search result. Let's for example try and put this one above it to see if people click this one. So this is this is not a very good example but
23:28
again people can do this to make it more enticing. Okay the words you write this is all about copyrighting how you write
23:33
it how enticing you make it at while at the same time making it uh optimized for SEO sprinkling in your keywords. Uh for
23:39
example schema markup. This right here this is done with schema markup which is a little snippet of code you can put on
23:44
your site. By the way, you can go watch this video right here that teaches exactly I'll leave it in the description that teaches you exact exactly, excuse
23:51
me, how to put this onto your site, whether that's a local business or if you're like a product, for example, if you are, I don't know, uh, Apple AirPods
23:58
Max. So, this stuff right here, uh, this image right here is done with schema. This is because of schema. Uh,
24:04
this is because of schema again. So, this all this is called schema markup or structured data. You can't add these
24:10
little quirks to your search results. And this is good because I mean just just look how more enticing this is to
24:17
click right as a big image occupies more pixels has like these little stars right
24:22
here which I mean none of these other half. So this calls more attention. So this is why technical SEO is important because it allows you to add these
24:28
little quirks and features and which also at the same time improve your SEO and your clickthrough rate. Okay. Again
24:33
if you want to learn how to do schema markup and add these little stars and all that stuff watch this video right here because it teaches you step by step
24:38
how to do so. Okay. Again, all these three pillars are very important. You can't you cannot succeed in the SEO
24:45
space without these three. Okay, that's very very important. And so now with out of the way, again, we'll circle back to all this. Don't worry. Uh but with that
24:51
out of the way, right, it's time to talk about um satisfying search intents, talking about producing content, right?
SEO Strategies
24:57
And this is where um SEO strategies come in. SEO, right,
25:02
strategies come in. Why? because SEO strategies are all about what is the
25:08
content you're producing, how you're producing it. Okay? Um, and there's infinite strategies you can apply here.
25:13
Now, let me let me make this make more sense. Uh, for example, let's assume I have a software business. Actually, let
25:21
me just give you a tangible example, right? I own this business right here, arro.com. Okay? We are a software
25:26
business. We are an AI SEO tool. Okay? Now, there's many more like there's there's a couple of competitors of ours,
25:32
of course. There's if you're in a business without competitors, you're either going to become extremely wealthy
25:37
because nobody has thought and realized that there's an amazing opportunity to make money or you're you're poor because
25:43
if there's no competitors, then the niche is so small, nobody's looking for it. Um, so of course we have competitors. And one of the ways we can
25:50
drive traffic, one of the strategies, excuse me, we can apply, there's infinite ones, and I'll go over a couple that we can apply to get more traffic to
25:57
our page is to talk about competitors. For example, right here we have these pages which are very outdated. Okay, but
26:03
the talk about it's a it's a comparison page between us and them, right? And we
26:08
compare both products. What happens with these pages, right? What happens with a comparison page? Well, on a comparison
26:14
page, what we're doing, and again, this is I know this is tailored for software and a lot of people don't have software businesses, but again, point here again
26:20
like I said at the beginning of the video is to explain to you my thought process behind things as well as giving you as many examples as I possibly can.
26:26
Okay? So, stay with me here. If you don't have a software company, don't worry. Okay? So again what do these uh
26:31
comparison pages do comparison page? Well we are talking about and mentioning
26:38
keywords like competitor name or alternative to competitor name. Okay. So
26:46
on this page we optimize it. We write content in a way that satisfies the intent for people searching for price.
26:52
So okay we know we want to target our competitor's keywords because we know if if you can if we can rank first for
26:58
competitor name price right and rank a proper page right a blog post doesn't matter that talks about the price and we
27:04
can also mention hey listen this is their price and here's why we are better we are cheaper and xyz or if we can rank
27:10
for the keyword alternative to competitor name right we can capture the section of the market that's actively
27:15
looking for an alternative to this competitor so again this is super bottom of the funnel someone searching for
27:20
alternative to competitor one Well, they know what their product does. They maybe they've tried it before and they're actively looking to buying an
27:27
alternative, right? So, these are what these comparison pages do. They allow you to target super bottom bottom keywords. I know this is mostly for SAS
27:34
and you if you if you have a SAS, right? I broken down this strategy step by step. You can go watch these two videos
27:40
right here. They literally break down this exact strategy like why we do it, how we do it. Okay? So, this is just one
27:47
of many strategies, right, for software, for example, doing comparison pages. Okay? still in the in the software
27:53
niching and this applies to anything, right? For example, a software has features and so of course we make pages for all our features. So every single
27:59
feature has a page and what these pages are, they're pretty simple, right? H1, paragraph, call to action, video
28:04
explaining the feature and information about the feature, but this is crafted in such a way that we can target the
28:09
keywords. For example, for this page, we wanted to rank for AI SEO agent or AI agent or SEO autopilot, excuse me. And
28:15
so we write the keyword, we sprinkle in the keywords in the H1, we sprinkle in the keywords the paragraph, right? We sprinkle the keywords in what we write
28:21
on the page, the info right on the page. And again, I know this is applied to software, but you do the exact same thing if you're a local business, right?
28:26
You're going to have a service page or a location page. And by the way, I I know I keep mentioning videos, but you can
28:32
you can go watch and you should watch this video right here that literally breaks down in I think two hours a local
28:39
SEO strategy. So, if you're a local business, a chiropractor, a lawyer, right? If you if you want to rank on Google Maps, right, if you want to rank
28:46
on the local search, go watch this video right here because it explains to you the whole process behind a um a local
28:52
SEO strategy. So, I'll leave it down below in the description. So, don't worry. So, I'll leave it down below in the description. So, don't worry. Okay? And again, this applies also to
28:59
products, right? You should have a product page. Okay? Right? The same strategy applies to products, right?
29:04
Having a page for the product that targets the keywords or for example, right? Another strategy for SEO is
29:10
simply having a blog. simply producing content that satisfy the search intent. So, for example, this blog, right? The whole goal is to rank for Shopify SEO
29:16
apps, right? Because we have an app for Shopify SEO. So, you want to rank for this and you want to show people all these apps that exist and of course then
29:22
mention ours. Well, at the same time, this is something that people often like fail to do is they don't have calls to
29:27
action. So, we'll see like as you scroll, there's a sticky call to action up here on the left, right, where people can click and at the bottom, if you keep
29:33
on scrolling down, there's another call to action down here. Okay? So, optimizing your website for conversions
29:39
is key. Whether you're writing a blog post or whether you're making like a comparison page for example, right? This one or or a feature page has has a call
29:45
to action down up here. Call to action down here, right? You need to do calls to action all the time. Call to action right here. Uh I think call to action
29:51
down here as well. So you need to be doing call to action all the time. Doesn't matter what your business is. Again, I know I'm talking about a
29:57
software here, but all these principles apply to the exact same all these businesses. Okay? And again, if you're a
30:03
local business, you want a bit more nuanced in-depth training, please go watch this video right here that teaches you exactly how to do local SEO. Okay?
30:10
And again, you can go watch these ones right here that teach you how to do SEO for SAS business, which is our business.
30:16
Okay? But again, these are all um applied to the these mindsets are applied across the board to all these
30:22
different businesses. Now, the simplest strategy is just to produce blog pages and feature pages. feature pages for an
30:29
SAS or for a local business like service or location pages or for an e-commerce
30:34
store uh product pages and e-commerce as well. You could also produce blog pages. Okay, so this is the simplest strategy,
30:39
the most classical one. Open up your site, create a blog if you don't have one, okay, blog. If you're an e-commerce
30:46
store, create a product page. Of course, you should have the product pages. Okay, if you're a local business service page
30:52
and location pages, okay, it's pretty much it. Okay, with this you can you win
30:57
99% of the times in your SEO endeavors. Okay, again if you're a software business, go for blog, go for um let's
31:06
call this uh these are in essence what these are. These are are basically
31:12
feature pages. So let's feature pages, right? This basically the same thing because it's the same uh structure. So
31:17
if you have a software business, have a blog, have feature pages, right? These feature pages are going to be just slash the feature name. If you have an
31:24
e-commerce store, have a blog and have a product page. If you have a local business, well, have a blog, have a service page, and have a location page.
31:30
This SEO SEO strategy applies to almost 100% of the businesses out there. Okay,
31:35
that's pretty much it. So, now that you know what you have to do, well, you have to produce content for these pages. So, produce blog posts. Produce again, these
31:42
blog posts need to satisfy the search intent of your keywords. Okay? Create the services pages, right? Make them
31:48
beautiful, right? Make them with a proper H1 call to action. to explain what the service is or the or the
31:53
locations you serve. Okay, that's pretty much it. If you're watching this, most likely you already have these pages. So,
31:58
assuming you don't have them, go out and create them. Go out and create and start producing content. Okay? And I don't I
32:03
don't know what else to tell you here. It's pretty straightforward. Just make the list of your keywords, produce content that satisfy that search intent.
32:09
Now, if you already have them, but they're not ranking. Well, now we need we need to analyze why they're not
32:14
ranking. And this is the simplest thing you can do, right? is just take the keywords you you these pages are ranking
32:21
for right put the pages in a rank tracker right and see the positions they're ranking right and see who's
32:28
ranking above you and analyze and this construct why they're ranking above you okay for example let's go here for
32:34
example and type in Dallas plumber again I'll use this I'll try to vary from u local business to product business to
32:41
SAS but the principles all apply and by the way for local business there's a bunch of rank factors that make for
32:47
example these these guys rank above these ones. Could be my previous search history. Could be my location. If I'm if I'm closer to these guys, these are
32:53
going to rank higher. So, there's a bunch of like nuance here. But let's assume, right, these guys, let's assume
33:00
we are these ones, right? And these are ranking above us. Why? Why are these guys ranking above us, right? Uh I would
33:07
first look at the domain, right? In local SEO and even in SEO general, like exact match domains, right? Dallas
33:13
plumber, this is the exact keyword, Dallas plumbing, right? usually give you an extra boost. Okay? Uh than for
33:18
example this right here because it's yet another place where they cleverly in inserted their keywords, right? So
33:25
again, this is against Google's terms of service unless these guys are actually called Dallas plumber, which I'm most
33:30
likely they're not. And often times they also like if you see here, let's see if this happens right here. Uh yeah, so the
33:38
name of this business is Metroflow Plumbing, but then they just stamped in their exact match right here, Dallas
33:43
Emergency Plumbers, right? So this most likely isn't the name of their business. So people what they do is sometimes they
33:49
report them these businesses because this isn't really again this is against Google terms of services but the reality
33:54
is that just works like sprinkling your keywords right here. So I would look at this and say hm maybe it's because
33:59
they're domain and but the thing is that both of them have exact match domain. So wouldn't be this. Okay. Then I would
34:05
look at the site the page that ranked. So these are both homepages ranking. Okay. So I'd look right. Then I would say hm let me just go here and do a a
34:11
more in-depth analysis. Let me just take in their sites and plug them into age and look at their backlink profile
34:17
first. Right? These guys have let's see 180 referring domains and these ones
34:22
have 47. So they have less backlinks. Now does it mean does having less
34:28
backlinks mean you're going to rank uh lower? Not necessarily. Right? May maybe they have less backlinks but they are
34:34
more powerful. In this case they're not. Right? This case this do domain rating for this business is higher. Okay. So
34:41
again, there's a bunch of stuff here. So DR and all these metrics all they all stem from the metric called PR that
34:48
Google came out with years ago which they then stopped sharing because people were using to to manipulate search. But
34:53
these metrics like don't rely blindly on these ones. These can easily be manipulated. I could I can increase your site's DR to 80 overnight. Not overnight
35:00
but like in weeks time. But that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to rank higher. So don't look at these metrics blindly. So what I'm saying is when I'm
35:06
looking at here and saying, "Okay, why are these guys ranking above me?" Uh yeah, they have high higher DR, but I mean this this this higher DR isn't
35:13
necessarily correlated with higher rankings. Okay, but again I would look okay, they have more backlinks than me. Let me just see what their backlinks are
35:19
like what their are their backlinks. Can I replicate some of their backlings? Can I go through this and see, oh, okay, maybe I can replicate this backlink and
35:25
I would start disconstructing what they're doing in terms of backlinks. For example, in terms of technical SEO,
35:31
looking at their um metatitle, meta description, for example, here, right here, their metatitle, Dallas
35:37
plumber.com, we have Dallas plumbing. The word plumber is a bit more I wrote the word plumber on Google. Maybe it's a
35:42
bit more common, so maybe I'd change it, right? Uh this right here is too long. So, this could be impacting my CTR as
35:48
well. So, I could be having less less clicks. Yes, I I would have less clicks because I'm ranking second, but I I
35:53
could be having even less because of this right here. So, it's too long. It's too long. So, it's not even appearing. So, it's pointless to have such a long
35:59
um uh metatitle because it doesn't even appear. So, this this little stuff could be hindering your your clickthrough rate, which inherently will make you um
36:06
rank lower. At the same time, this could be a better H1 metitle. Having the word
36:11
home right here is a bit weird. Uh you can add like a a painoint right here. Maybe 24-hour plumber or something like that, right? Or the best prices or
36:17
something. So, I would I would do an audit and disconstruct what they're doing and how I can do it better. For
36:23
example, if I see the the page bathroom plumbing, uh they have some right here.
36:29
Let's see. They don't. But let's say these two pages are competing. This one and this one, right? I look at my page,
36:34
right? I'd look at okay, I have an H1. I have this text. Do I have internal links? Am I internal linking?
36:40
No, there's no phone number. This is a bit of weird page. Not much contact content. Let me just see this.
36:49
So here here we have reviews on this page a right here a internal link. So I'm
36:57
internal internal linking between these pages and internal linking is key right uh internal having a proper internal
37:02
link structure is key. So these overall and I could spend hours and hours doing an audit right here. I won't. But this
37:09
constructing and trying to understand why they're ranking above us. Looking at your page versus theirs and looking at
37:14
yours and what you have on yours and looking at theirs and seeing what they have on theirs. What's their age one, right? What's their age two? What does
37:22
this content talk about? Am I talking about the same content? Because it's super simple, right? You see for the keyword, right? What type of content
37:28
Google ranks and you try to make a better piece of content with more info, right? Add more images, add more videos,
37:34
maybe add more social proof, right? because these might seem like simple reviews, but they're here. It's text, right? And these all um contribute to
37:42
adding info to the page that can satisfy the search intent. Hopefully, this is making sense. Again, there there's so
37:48
much nuance here that only like it would be impossible to make a proper audit in this video. So, I think I have a couple
37:54
of Yeah, I have I have this one. This video is going over an audit like how to do an audit. I think it's like 20
38:00
minutes long going over how to do an audit for local SEO in specific like for Google maps and local SEO type
38:05
businesses. So go watch this one for again I'll leave all links for this in the description. Don't worry. Go watch this one for how to do a local audit.
38:10
Okay, that breaks down all all my thinking process behind this stuff behind this constructing why they're ranking first. And um this video right
38:18
here breaks down how to do an audit like in general for for a generic type of site. So go watch those two. They're going to be very very helpful. And now
38:24
going back here. So going back here, right? We know now that we have to starting from the beginning get our keywords right then produce content that
38:31
satisfies the search intent for set keywords. Okay, in this case we're talking about written based content, right? Your location pages, your
38:37
services pages, your feature pages, your product pages, your blog pages. And the whole the whole goal of this, right, is
38:42
to optimize these pages, right? Optimize, right? And by optimize, I mean, as a generic term, right, right,
38:51
satisfy the search intent, which in other words means, right, sprinkling in your
38:58
keywords throughout the page. So in your headings, so your H1, H2, H3, right? In
39:05
your paragraphs, okay? Adding images, images with the proper alt text, with proper description, adding videos,
39:11
right? Adding bullets, tables, quotes, right? An FAQ section. So adding all in
39:17
all, right, the only thing that matters if you just think about it is satisfying the search intent. Then you write
39:23
information that you think best satisfies that search intent. It's pretty much it. Now, for example, if
39:29
we're talking about uh a blog post, okay? And I'm using my tool, by the way. U this is the best tool for for SEO,
How Content Drives Sales (blogging with AI)
39:35
plain and simple. And I'm 100% biased, but uh but yeah, it's just the best one. Uh and yeah, you could be using tools
39:42
like Chetch, but I'll tell you why in a second. It doesn't make any sense. Okay? Again, all I'm doing here, and Arvo isn't the magic tool, right? Arvo
39:48
doesn't do SEO for you, right? All it does just saves you time. Here's an example. Let's say, for example, I'm the
39:53
owner of of this business right here, Epic Gardening. I'm not the owner, right? But they what they do, right, is
39:58
they sell the um gardening supplies. You go to their shop, right? It's an e-commerce business. And they sell, right, uh seeds. They sell like uh
40:06
gloves. They sell uh these um like gardening bags, right? They sell basically ways for you if you're a
40:12
beginner to start uh your home home garden. Okay, pretty much it. They sell like gardening supplies for uh for
40:18
people. There you go. Gardening beds, gardening trays, right? Seeds, whatever, soils, a bunch of stuff for gardeners.
40:23
Okay, pretty straightforward. And what they do, one of the ways in which they uh drive traffic to their business is of
40:29
course, right, SEO. Again, they do ads as well, they do social media, they do a bunch of stuff, but they do SEO. This
40:35
right here, they have a bunch of blog posts, okay? Seven tips for faster seed germination, right? It's just
40:40
anformational piece of content with images, a table of contents, proper content structuring with in article images, links, right? Linking to other
40:47
pages on on their site, linking to their product pages, just a valuable piece of content. That's all this is. Okay? And
40:54
here's an example. This right was done with AI. This is all done with AI. Okay,
40:59
the the AI wrote the article, added the videos, added the images, added links. So link linking out to other blog posts
41:06
of of theirs, excuse me. Uh their homepage, maybe uh maybe a a service page or a product page, maybe these are
41:12
all internal links, by the way. Maybe links to Wikipedia, a link to another author authorative blog in the gardening
41:17
niche. It added the internal links, the external links, the images, the the
41:23
videos, right? The bullets, the tables, the quotes, right? Anything and everything it thinks would be best to satisfy the search intent. In this case,
41:29
the article is is about guarding this for beginners, right? And again, yes, you can write all this manually. But in
41:35
a world of AI, why would you do that? Why would you do that? Excuse me. Like why not use AI? AI just allows allows
41:40
you to do the same work just way way faster. Like I oftentimes give this example, right? If me and you are in a
41:46
table building competition, me, this is me. This is you. The goal is to build a table, right? And the person who builds
41:51
the most tables the fastest wins, right? I have a screwdriver. This is a screwdriver. Okay? And you have your
41:58
little hand. Okay? And you're using your hand to tighten up the bolts and the legs to the top. And I'm using a
42:03
screwdriver to tighten up the bolts. Yeah. By the end of the day, we're both have have are going to have tables
42:08
built. I'll just be able to build so many more tables so much faster because while you're using your hand, I'm using this tool that allows me to tighten up
42:14
the bolt so much faster. And this is AI, right? At the end of the day, AI amplifies our output. So this tool is
42:22
AI. And so yeah, we do the same thing. I just do it so much faster nowadays with a bit more input and a bit more success.
42:28
Um, for example, let's say uh you feel like this paragraph right here is a bit too too weird, too short. Go here and
42:34
just make it longer. Okay? So the AI will take you into account the whole context of the article and make this paragraph a bit longer, right? And you
42:39
can approve or decline, right? Approve. Let's say, for example, you think that this info right here is better explained in a table form or in a list format. You
42:46
just click here and this AI will transform this into a table form. Or you can even add custom prompts like for example um write this more tailored to
42:55
beginners or sprinkle in the keywords um my my product, whatever. You can add custom prompts and change up the article
43:00
how it's written. You can sprinkle your keywords here or you can say um add links and the AI will read through your
43:06
article, read through this paragraph in specific and find the best places to add external links to. So linking out to
43:11
external authority sources, right, in just a few seconds. Can you do this manually? 100%. But why would you? So
43:17
again, let's go boom boom boom boom. So you can click to see the sources. Yeah,
43:22
you could do this manually, but you have to choose the an the anchor. You had to go and find sites that made sense. This
43:27
just doesn't make any sense nowadays. And if you're using AI images, for example, like this one, this is an article with AI images. You can say
43:32
stuff like uh add a dog and the AI will take into account the existing context of the images and the article as a
43:39
whole. And in this case, add a dog to a like gardening like scenario as you see here on the picture. So there you go. A
43:46
dog added to the uh the sort of garden. Boom. Accept. These are AI. You can use your own images if you'd like. Point here is that AI just saves you so much
43:52
more time. So point being is that you can use tools like this to uh improve the speed at which you write your blogs
43:58
or your uh service page. What doesn't matter there's a bunch more stuff or for example you can interact with the article say for example uh adds a
44:05
paragraph titled the gardener
44:10
9000 the best best gardening tool for
44:16
beginners. And now because you're able to speak back and forth with the article the AI will find the best place to
44:22
include this. Now, this of course this product doesn't exist, right? But you'll find the best place to add this paragraph to and and and write some sort
44:28
of description about this product. You can tell it to link to the product. You can tell it to add an image, add a video, link here, link there. So, you
44:34
can speak back and forth with the article, right? This as if you're using CHPD, but this has a bunch more context
44:39
into um your brand. It links with your site automatically. You can click a button and publishes straight to your
44:44
site. Um let's just wait for There you go. It's added the thing right here. Let's see where it is. Boom. There you
44:49
go. The the the the paragraph. It's right here. Okay. And I can accept. Boom. Now, again, you can speak back and
44:55
forth. You can add limits, add links. You can do so much more with this. You can, for example, go here and say, uh, publish article. And the article will be
45:01
published straight to your site. Now, if you're wondering if this works, here's a bunch of case studies of people actually
45:06
using this to get insane amounts of traffic. Just read the titles on the videos like 0 to 12,000, 0 to 6,000. I
45:12
mean, it's insane. This works, right? Again, this is not a magic tool. But when you pair a tool that leverages AI
45:17
for SEO, that allows you to speed up the processes at which you do SEO applied with the knowledge you have about SEO,
45:23
you can have insane results. So I'll leave links for all these case studies down below description so you can go watch them and see what they did, why
45:28
they did it, and how you can do it, too. Okay, so go watch those. And it's insane. It does of course work. Now, can you succeed without AI? Yeah, you can,
45:34
but I mean just way way faster if you use AI. And since we're here like talking about uh technical SEO, right? You can go here to site optimizers,
Using an AI Agent to automate technical SEO
45:40
click create optimizer, add your site name, URL, language, select how many pages as you want, add your site map. And what this will do is it will
45:46
automatically crawl your site. It will crawl as many pages as you want. In this case case, it crawled 50 pages, right?
45:51
And then you will allow you to optimize your technical SEO on autopilot. So it analyzes all this stuff page which we
45:57
talked about before, right? Page titles, metad descriptions, canonic URLs, image, all text, internal links, and schema.
46:03
And it tells you, hey, listen, for example, let's go here for for let me just zoom in a bit for page titles. our current page style for this page right
46:08
here. For example, for I don't know um the AI SEOU agent page, which funny
46:15
enough is this exact feature page. If I go here to arvo.com/ AISU agents, it's just a page
46:20
like going over the feature. Again, don't just focus on SAS. This is can be applied to any niche, okay? Any type of
46:26
business. So, this is the page, simple, pretty straightforward page that goes over why it works. It scans your site then with smart reasoning can actually
46:32
implement the changes. So, if I go here again, it's saying, hey, listen, your current page style, right? page title is
46:37
AI SEO agent aro. We suggest you change it to automate your SEO agency with aro SEO with aro AI agent and here's why. So
46:44
the AI tells you, gives you a suggestion, then tells you, hey, listen, here's why we think you should change it. And if you hit apply, right, the AI
46:50
agent will automatically go to your site and implement this change just like that. Just hit apply or discard and bas
46:56
on what you apply in this card, the AI will learn for future recommendations. So this is a such a fast way to automate
47:03
your uh technical SEO. It's insane. I can just if I agree with this thing, I can just hit apply, right? And the good
47:09
thing about this, we could simply just not include the why here. We could just not tell you, but I feel like it's very
47:14
important that we tell you why we're doing things and you based on based on our critical thinking if you agree or
47:19
not with these changes. And again, if you agree right with the why, which I think in this case I agree, right? I
47:24
wouldn't apply. And this works for titles, descriptions, uh, canonical URLs, image, all text. By the way, if I if you test this right now, I can assure
47:30
you you have a bunch of images without all text. We do and we should not do this, right? Internal links. This is
47:36
pretty cool. Like you have a site with a bunch of pages, a bunch of pages on your site, right? your homepage, your blog
47:41
page, your services pages, the will run through them all and suggest a s a a
47:47
tailored internal linking structure. So, hey, link link your homepage to your service page, link your service page to your blog page, right? And this is key,
47:53
right? Here right here is suggesting us to link this page using this anchor text to this one and tells us the why. And if
47:58
I apply the I will automatically add a link to this page on my site to the other one. And having a proper internal
48:03
linking structure is key is a crucial part of your technical SEO strategy because let's say this is your service
48:09
page and this is your homepage and this is your blog page one of your blog pages. If you build links to this page
48:14
you build back links to this page which we'll cover again and this links to this one. Well the link juice will flow through to this page and if this one
48:21
links to this one the link juice will flow through to this page as well. So if you don't have a proper internal linking structure when you're building backlinks
48:26
it can hinder the uh the success and the effectiveness of your backlinks. So you're just wasting money. So having a
48:33
proper internal infrastructure is key. Schema markup. We talked about this again. I suggest you go watch that video that I mentioned in the beginning of of
48:38
this video, right? It automates your schema. So it gives you the code, right, for the schema, for example, for the review for the review schema for those
48:44
little little stars we talked about when you like I'll show you again, right? Error pods max. I think it was
48:51
this. Scroll down. This little star right here, this right here is done with schema. And this AI gives you the schema
48:57
code. If you just hit apply, you'll automatically apply to your site and you'll get those stars. In this case, you just do FAQ schema and article
49:02
schema. We'll do a bunch more in the future. So, this automates your technical SEO for you, which mean it is insane. It can also automate your social
49:08
media, which is key, right? Because this comes in handy when we're talking about LM SEO, AI SEO, which is what I want to
49:15
talk up next. And we again, we'll cover link building. Don't worry, but now I want to talk the next part of the video about
49:21
LLM SEO. Again, LLM SEO. So, let's break this down. Hey, it's me again. Just want

50:09
it's going to be the very first link in the description. Check it out if you want. If not, I'll let you keep watching. Cheers. And so for this part
LLM SEO (ranking on AI engines with AEO)
50:15
about LLM SEO, right, I need to explain to you the theory behind how these LLMs work and how you get to be positioned or
50:23
cited and why they site certain sites over others. So I'm going to play a clip of a previous video I recorded that's
50:29
going to give you a bunch of context on to how this stuff works. So please again pay attention. This going to go over
50:35
exactly step by step how LLM work and how we can start to implement some of the things we applied into the regular
50:41
SEO to the AI LM based SEO. play the clip. Right, so we have a lot to cover, so let's just get going. Welcome to the
50:47
LLM SEO course. It's going to be a step-by-step guide on how to get your site recommended in LLMs in seven simple
50:53
steps. Now, I say recommended instead of ranking because unlike with Google or Bing, right, you don't really get ranked, right? These LLMs, right?
50:59
Whether that's Grog, Perplexi, or CHPT, they recommend your brand on your site, not necessarily rank it. Okay? Now,
51:06
again, I'm going to show you in seven simple steps how to do this. And I'm also going to show you a live example of how we're doing LLM SEO for our own
51:12
brand and how it's being recommended and how we're doing it so you could just copy what we're doing. Okay. Now, first
51:17
things first, right, I want to give you a bit of context as to why LLM is the future of SEO, but not entirely. Okay.
51:23
First things first is right, most people here, right, you, me, everyone, right, tends to now use uh these LLM, right?
51:29
Whether that's this is the essentially the the front the customer front-facing product, right? CHPd is a product, Plexi
51:35
is a product, Rock is a product and behind the scenes, it's a large language model working. Okay, now they've just
51:41
chosen to show us and allow us as users to interact with our product in this way in a chat manner. Okay, in a back and
51:47
forth manner. Okay, now it is a feature of SEO because again there's a lot of searches we as people used to search on
51:53
the I guess classic or traditional search engines where it makes much more sense to search them on one of these
51:59
products. They are based off of an LLM, right? these chatbased back and forth um
52:05
products that allow you to ask a question and then iterate on that question based on prior context. Okay.
52:10
And the reason why I say not entirely is because yes a lot of queries can now be searched on these types of of of
52:16
products but still right there's a lot of of searches that still make more sense to search on the classic search
52:21
engine like Google or bank. So again it is the future for some searches not for all them. Okay, for example, if you're
52:28
looking for local business, most likely you'll search on Google and then go to Google Maps, right? You won't necessarily search CHPD for that. At
52:34
least not as of now, right? As we stand right now. Okay? Now, it's not to say that Google won't come up and Google
52:40
won't won't change the way that search engine works, but as of today, as of 2025, right, you still use Google in the
52:46
classic manner, which is a list of like results. Again, things could change. Google can change how their product
52:52
looks like, maybe more towards a chatbased type thing. Who knows? But still again they will never that's my
52:58
take at least they will never completely get rid of the classic search engine uh type u structure where you can't
53:05
interact back and forth between the searches. So I still do believe that yes this is the future right for searches
53:10
which you want to more context on and interact between between the things but not entirely because again there will still be types of searches that will
53:17
require you to go to the traditional ones. Okay hopefully this makes sense. Now, uh, what's the principles of LMSO?
53:22
And again, I know this sounds boring, but it's it's important context that I need to give you before we jump into the juicy stuff. Okay. Um, the principles of
53:29
LLMO, right? Honestly, this is quite straightforward, right? People ask questions. You optimize for back and
53:35
forth. Okay? All these LLM, right? The principle of them, right, is users like me and you, you ask questions, right?
53:42
And the principles of the optimization, the search engine optimization for these LLMs is you optimize, optimize, excuse
53:48
me, for the back and forth. So you need to optimize your brand in a way where when someone asks a question in each one
53:55
of these models or future models, right? You got to optimize for asked questions and also for a potential back and forth
54:02
because most of us right now when you use CHPD, Plexi or Grock, you don't just ask one thing, right? You ask it one
54:08
thing, then you follow up with a couple of questions, okay? It's not just a one liner like Google or B. So you can
54:14
optimize for questions and for the back and forth and I'll show you how to do that all that in a second here. Okay, those are basically the principles of LM
54:20
SEO, right? It's not anything revolutionary. Okay. Now, how to do LMEO step by step, right? Well, you'll notice
54:27
that when you search for stuff right here, and I'll give you tangible examples, right? Uh they mention the biggest brands in a given niche. So if
54:33
you search for what's the most um tasty u energy drink, most likely we're going
54:38
to recommend Red Bull, um Monster, right? it will mention the biggest brands in a given niche, right? If you
54:44
search for the best AI writing tool, most likely will mention like Jasper and all these big big ventureback companies.
54:50
Why? Because they're the biggest brands. And you'll notice me talking about this word very often. Um because it's a
54:57
keyword right here in a given niche. Okay. Now, now that the theories out of the way, let's actually give you some
55:02
tang tangible examples with actual prompts. Okay. So, first things first is you got to choose the prompts you want to rank for. actually not rank but be
55:09
recommended for again because these tools right here these products that on the back end run LLMs right they are
55:15
more of an interactive chat type back and forth basis than the classic uh Google search for example on Google
55:20
again you get search for something and 10 results will pop up and you click which ones you want again with these
55:26
products again the LMbacked type chats which are the new wave of search engines right is not like this right it is it is
55:32
a much more interactive experience okay so most people right optimize
55:38
most not most people but the the smart people optimize for prompts. So here's an example, right? Well, for example, let's say for example your product is an
55:44
AI writer. Okay, let's say you are an AI SEO writer. So an AI tailored for SEO. Okay, so keywords you want to rank for
55:51
on Google and B. So the classic search engines would be for example AI writer, SEO, AI writer, AI writer for SEO, best
55:58
a writing tool, AI writer tools list with price. Okay. Now, in terms of prompts, you want to do something more
56:04
complex because again, the experience of someone going into these ones is way,
56:09
way different than someone going to this one. And you'll notice that some types of your searches will you will go to
56:15
Google and some types of of your searches will go to these engines right here. Again, it will depend on on the
56:21
intent behind your search. If you want a bit more context back and forth talking, right, you'd go to these ones. And this
56:27
is almost I guess um by instinct now and it will only become more and more like this. Again some searches will go here
56:33
some will go here and the search that will go here the intent behind the search and the keywords and the the the
56:38
longtail versions of the keywords essentially is way different than on here. Let me continue with the example. So again the prompt well while well
56:44
you'd optimize for this right well while people on Google will search for this people on these LLM engines will search
56:50
for for example what's the best airing tool for SEO best autoing software are air riders safe for SEO question give me
56:57
list of air writing tools and their prices now here's an example like if you search just for a writer on these LLMs
57:03
right it doesn't know what to give you because it's it's too generic there's too much ambiguity right is he looking
57:09
for a product recommendation does he want to know how AI writers work. Does he want to know if they're safe? Right?
57:15
Again, there's a lot of ambiguity, right? Well, if you search for this on on Google, right? Most likely to come up
57:21
with a with um uh product recommendations. And again, you you would search for this on Google. You'd
57:28
never search for this on these LLMs. That's just how how it works nowadays, right? You'd never search for this there
57:33
because you know, right? Because you've used it before. You know that if you just search for this, it's not enough
57:38
context for it to know and give you a proper back and forth. You'll have to give it a second prompt, maybe a third
57:44
prompt, right? If you just search AI writer, it what happens if it gives you like the if it gives you info on how
57:50
they work, right? You say, "Oh, no. Don't don't tell me how they work. Tell me, give me a list of some give me tell me the prices." So, inherently, right,
57:56
you know that not to search for these keywords with with a lot of ambiguity on these these types of new search engines.
58:03
So, you'll search for prompts. What what a prompt is essentially is a basically a longtail version of your keywords with a
58:08
bunch more context because again if you don't give it context it doesn't know what you're looking for for it doesn't know if you're looking for a product
58:13
recommendation if you want to know how they work if you know if you want to know if they're safe right so you got to give it exact prompts again if you
58:20
search for this on Google AI rider tools list with price right right here there's a couple results there's even this one
58:26
result right here which basically a list of of these however this is not like it's not good enough right if you search
58:31
for the same thing right this on um to AI writer tools list with price or uh
58:38
give me a list of a writing tools when their prices right it will give you the same thing but then you can go back and
58:43
forth right and you can even say give me a table results right so again the intent behind the search is different
58:50
right here if you search for this on Google or actually right here if you search for this keyword on Google you're just looking for a list and not much
58:56
context if you search for this on a or grock or GPT or proplexity you know by
59:03
default that you're going to ask it a second question because again how many times have you asked only once one thing
59:09
to the these things right here most people ask multiple things it's a back and forth experience and that's one of
59:15
the main reasons and main differentiators differentiators I guess of the L or the SEO nowadays that is for
59:21
LMSO you got to optimize for back and forth and that comes with first thing optimizing for prompts okay and I'll go
59:28
over how how to how to do that I just want you to understand the difference here hopefully this is making sense so far again most Most people here it's one
59:34
query search, right? Excuse me. Is most people here is a onetime search. Most people here is a multiple back and forth
59:41
type search. Okay, hopefully this makes sense. Now again, you got to choose the
59:46
prompts you want to rank for. Okay, usually it's going to be stuff like this, but again, you can make a list out of it. And I'll give you some examples in in a bit. Okay, then you got to
59:53
optimize for brand mentions across the web. And this is Google has been doing this for a long time now. Uh basically
59:59
what this is is have your brand mentioned anywhere you can. Google, Bing, YouTube videos, Tik Tok, Twitter,
1:00:05
Reddit, LinkedIn. So become a brand. Google and all these other LLMs value
1:00:11
brands, right? They recommend the most notorious brands in a certain niche, right? So it's about how well your brand
1:00:19
is perceived. How big is your brand perceived by all these people, all these LMS and all these search engines? So you
1:00:26
don't even have to have the biggest brand, right? You can have, for example, this big brand making a lot of money,
1:00:33
right? And then you can have this small brand making a even greater amount of
1:00:38
money, right? And again, be even though this brand is making more money, so more
1:00:43
customers, more more reliable, I guess, right? This one has a bigger brand, they make more noise on social, they're
1:00:50
hyperactive on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, they're everywhere. And the thing is that by by me saying active
1:00:57
everywhere, it's a synony synonym of saying there's more brand mentions of them all across the web. And where do
1:01:04
you think these models take their info from? Well, they they they they search the web. And if they search and find
1:01:09
more instances of this brand than this one, well, they'll perceive this one as
1:01:14
bigger. Of course, not all the time because of course if this brand has some
1:01:19
pres presence in the web and if they talk about how many customers they have, well, and and these LLM see, okay, yeah,
1:01:26
this brand is there's less brand mentions, but they make more money. Either way, this is still going to be
1:01:32
mentioned in the um in the list if you ask it for a list. So my point here is that you don't necessarily need to be
1:01:37
the you don't necessarily want to be actually mean you want to be the bigger brand but it's not just because you are
1:01:42
the bigger brand as in not just because you make more money and more and more successful that you're going to be recommended more times. The brands that
1:01:49
are recommended more times are the brands that are bigger and you become bigger by the number of mentions your brand has. And of course by default
1:01:55
right if you have more brand mentions most likely you make a lot of money. So again it they're they're correlated but
1:02:03
they're not not a causation. So there's there's correlation but not causation. Hopefully this making sense. Again, it's
1:02:08
not just because you are the brand making the most money that you're going to be the most well-known one. Okay? And
1:02:14
there's countless examples of that. So again, but not know note that that of course if you're a big brand in terms of
1:02:20
notoriety, in terms of mentions online, well, most likely you're also going to be making a lot of money. Okay? But this
1:02:27
is to say and if we compare it on a normal or lower level, right? We have a lot of competitors maybe making more
1:02:32
money than us, but because we are more notorious across the web, well, we're recommended more times and more often
1:02:39
than some of the competitors that than some of our competitors making more money than us. Hopefully, this makes
1:02:44
sense. Now, third in the the I guess this little point right here, again, I'll give you a list of all the things you need to do, but third, um, you got
1:02:50
to be coherent. So if you mention anywhere on the web that you're the best for XYZ, right, be coherent so you don't
1:02:56
confuse these LLMs because again they're pulling in info from all across the web. And if you're saying that you're the
1:03:02
best product for plumbers and the best product for surgeons and the best product for um I don't know uh doctors,
1:03:08
right? Well, they're going to think of you as this very broad solution great
1:03:14
for all these different niches. And when someone is looking for a tailored solution, well, maybe these guys will
1:03:21
maybe the the LMS will not recommend your brand because they'll see you as this oneizefits-all brand, right? Which
1:03:28
again might be good for some of your prompts, but maybe you want you want to attract a an audience that's just for
1:03:34
plumbers. So again, don't confuse this. Don't tell don't put in forress web that
1:03:39
you do all this stuff that you're great for XYZ, that you have all these things when maybe you don't, right? Again, this
1:03:45
is more the um classic search engine, Google search engine optimization where you'd want to rank for a bunch of
1:03:51
different keywords even though they're maybe not very relative with your niche. This can be detrimental for the this new
1:03:57
age of SEO because again, you're going to be confusing them, right? And these are not dumb, right? They know that if
1:04:03
you're saying you're good at all all things, right? They will recommend you as a a broader solution, a generic
1:04:09
solution, not a niche down solution. Okay? Again, of course, if you're a mega blog product, well, of course, you're
1:04:14
going to do that. But most products are in should be niched down. Okay? So, be coherent. Okay? And of course, be
1:04:20
coherent in saying that if you say that you do this, don't say that you don't do that. If if somewhere around along the
1:04:25
lines that you say your software has XYZ feature, don't say you don't have it. And this happens a lot, by the way,
1:04:31
because with software companies, they're usually developing features every single week or month, right? And in a blog post
1:04:36
or in a comparison article or in these tool directories, some of these tool directories mention that uh your tool
1:04:43
has this price and all these features, but then a week later you you drop your price, you add more features. So now
1:04:48
this is incoherent with what you have on your blog. So we have two incoherent things. These models are pulling in info
1:04:54
from here. It says the price is $10 a month. Here it says it's five. Here it says you have uh 50 features. Here it
1:05:00
says you have only 40. So it's pulling in incoherent info from across the web. Again, of course, they know how to filter and they know how to look at the
1:05:06
dates, but still try to be as coherent as possible so as to not confuse these models. And you'll notice that they're
1:05:13
confused when you do a bunch of searches on them and you know the brand you're talking about and they pull in info
1:05:19
that's not really true. That happens a lot. So, moving down with an actual live example and um and some prompts of what
1:05:25
we're actually doing for our own brand. Okay, so here's our main prompt. And again, this is an example of my own tool, which is trijournalist.com. It's
1:05:32
an AI SEO writing tool. It does a bunch of stuff, right? A bunch of features, a bunch of solutions, integrations, right?
1:05:38
It's a complex product. Okay. And so the main prompt is going to be this right here. What's the best autoblogging tool
1:05:43
for SEO? So what's that's the question the best qualifier? So it could be the cheapest, the most expensive, uh the
1:05:51
most simpler, right? It depends on on your niche, right? Uh auto blogging. So this is a feature. Okay. Tool for
1:05:57
industry industry niche or use case. Okay? could be for any different industry use case. I mean, you get the
1:06:02
point, right? So, this is a prompt. What's the best auto tool for SEO? Question, qualifier, feature, and niche,
1:06:08
industry, use case. Okay, so if I take this prompt right here, I'm going to put it into all these three uh LLMs. So,
1:06:16
let's just do chat, GPT, and let's do perplexity and let's do Grock. Okay.
1:06:23
Right. Let's see what they come up with. Right? Again, always pulling info from different places. So just note that the
1:06:29
um answers will be different. Okay. So here you go. Uh what's the besting tool? Okay. So it's going to give me a context
1:06:36
into what it is. Autoing tools can save you time, whatever, right? And then it gives me a list of uh a couple tools on
1:06:41
this is still loading. Let's see what has for me. Okay, perfect. So first things first, you'll notice that it pulled in a video. This is a video of
1:06:48
mine, right? So this essentially is a video that links to uh my site. Okay, so it pulled in a video. So it's taking in
1:06:54
info from again all across the web not just Google but it's taking info from LinkedIn YouTube anything that's
1:06:59
indexable they can gather info from okay and right here we are being promoted
1:07:05
here so brand mentioned right here journalist okay journalist again uh it's pulled that info from our site again
1:07:12
because we have a blog post that talks about this and again I'll give you ex exactly the step by step on how to do it but I just want to show you first how
1:07:18
things work okay and again it's basically recommending our product and then other notable tools it recommends a couple of our competitors Okay, now this
1:07:25
is a very important section right here which we'll go over in a bit. Now, Gro, so here we go. What's the best link to for SEO? Competitor of ours right here.
1:07:32
Competitor of ours. And there we go. This is our brand mention right here. Journal SEI. So, we're mentioning here in the text at the list. Okay. And then
1:07:38
finally, Chacht. Let's see what it did. So, CHP didn't actually recommend our brand. So, I I cannot find it anywhere
1:07:44
here. Not an issue though. Again, this is just for one one prompt. Now, I'll go back to this. I just want to go over
1:07:50
here. uh very important thing which is the secondary prompts again I'll give you a list of all the steps down here
1:07:57
which we're doing to right here all the seven steps they're very important which again will give you the step by step on
1:08:03
how to actually make your business show up but I think all the stuff that I talked about here is very important for
1:08:09
context okay so let's just break down the what I mean by by the secondary prompts okay so secondary prompts again
1:08:14
you know by now that the way users interact with these LLMs these these new
1:08:20
search engines is not just by asking one thing, it's by asking multiple things and doing it back and forth. Okay, so now our main prompt
1:08:26
is this and it was recommended two out of three times on these u LM. So Grock
1:08:32
recommended us uh Preplex Preplexi as well, excuse me. Uh the only one that didn't was at least again for this main
1:08:39
prompt. Uh we're going to take a look at secondary prompts and again these aren't just random. You'll notice that in my
1:08:45
seven steps, right? you'll optimize your site and your brand to show up for this.
1:08:50
So, for example, um let's say for example, uh uh um we'd go here to Chap
1:08:57
the one that did not recommend our product and ask it for example. Well, actually, let me just scroll up right here because I think the reason why is
1:09:02
because of the model I'm choosing. Let's just do 40 and let's just hit this again. Um because if I'm not mistaken,
1:09:08
this one I don't think it takes live info. I'm not too sure. Yeah, there. There you go. Right was the first one.
1:09:14
Uh so uh it may have been because of the model I chose. So just take that into account. Um again most people just use
1:09:20
this one if I'm not mistaken. So it's great for most questions. So here we go. We are the first brand mention. So we asked what's the best auto for SEO.
1:09:27
There we go. We're the first one right here. So we were recommended by all these three models. Again there's a lot of nuance here. If you choose different
1:09:33
models the the answers might be different. As you saw there the answers were different. And again because all
1:09:39
these take info from different sources anywhere in the internet and they put they might put different weights on info
1:09:45
for example coming from LinkedIn. Maybe GPT puts a more weight on info coming from Reddit. Maybe Grock puts more info
1:09:50
on people on what people talk about on Twitter. So you might want to mention you might want to mention your brand more on Twitter. Again all this stuff is
1:09:58
recommending our brand. And so now I want to go over um the actual seven steps we're taking to uh have it. So,
1:10:04
our brand is recommended here on the um on the LMS. So, first things first is
1:10:11
again actually the main takeaway here is LLM only have the info you give them.
1:10:16
Okay? So, give them more info than your competitors do. That's basically it. Again, all these LLMs, right, they take
1:10:23
info from all around the web to feed them, right? They feed them, right? And then it'll give you answers, right?
1:10:29
that's an A based on all the info they collected, right? And so if you have more info online about your competitors,
1:10:37
well more the more likely you are to be mentioned or recommended by one of these LLMs. Again, as you saw here, right, we
1:10:43
were recommended first here again uh we recommend we were the only one recommended right here on on on all
1:10:50
this. Of course, there were some secondary things right here and on here we were the again I mentioned as well as
1:10:55
the third one. So the way in which you do this and I guess the main take away from this video is LMS only have the
1:11:02
info you give them. Okay, they can they cannot make up info, right? They take info from somewhere on the web. So you
1:11:08
got to put as much info as you can on the web. And so here's how you do it. Well, first things first, one through
1:11:14
four is uh the classic SEO strategy, which is make the homepage on your site
1:11:20
with a clear message. For example, for our tool right here, right, we are the AI SEO writer that auto publishes your blog, right? And again, we have a bunch
1:11:26
more info right here about what our product does. And we even have down here, right? There we go. Automatic
1:11:32
publishing, automated with auto blog, right? We even have here down here a bunch of FAQs that again give extra
1:11:37
relevancy to our site. And again, this is the classic uh SEO thing. Yeah, you optimize your site with a clear message,
1:11:44
optimize for your keywords, right? Pages for each feature, right? What we have right here, which we have a a dedicated
1:11:51
page for each feature. For example, we have an AI news writer and we have a dedicated page for this feature. Talks about what it does, what it doesn't do,
1:11:58
its pricing, all this stuff. It goes over in depth on what it does. Again, we have pages for every single feature. Again, all this what we're doing here
1:12:04
was we're giving as much context as we can to these LLMs that will eventually
1:12:09
um scrape our site for info. So, they'll know that, okay, these guys have this feature, this one, this one, this one,
1:12:15
they have all this stuff right here. Okay. Same thing right here for the um the niche, right? Um actually they
1:12:22
didn't mention it here but same thing for the use cases. So uh solutions right we have solutions for e-commerce for agencies for startups. So if people are
1:12:29
prompting themselves and asking hey what's the best air raider for local businesses boom oh there you go the the
1:12:34
the LMS read through our site and found okay these guys have a dedicated page for this and they're the best because
1:12:39
XYZ all this stuff. So again solution pages for agencies startups location local business e-commerce right? Same
1:12:45
thing for integrations. Again got to give it as much info as you can. This is a classic, right? SEO strategy, right?
1:12:51
Uh yeah, the use cases page right here. Sorry, excuse me. And then um blog posts, right? Blog post with alternative
1:12:57
comparison and information pages. This is one of the biggest uh one of the class most classic SEO strategy right here. I I'll leave a link for this video
1:13:04
down below, which basically goes over uh my own this SAS right here, which is here. This SAS's SEO strategy for the
1:13:10
classic SEO strategy for showing up on Google and B. That being said, this
1:13:16
classic SEO strategy, the efforts I put into this bleed into the uh results that
1:13:21
are shown in these uh LLMs right here because again they take info from anywhere in the web. And if I have pages
1:13:28
on my site, right, comparing my product with others, talking about alternatives, right? And I'll show you here an example. For example, during if we go
1:13:35
here to the blog and just open this one right here, right? We have a blog post, for example. We have a bunch of these, right? 10 best. This is a competitor of
1:13:41
ours alternatives. We talk about what the competitor is, right? What they are, right? Their is is free, their pricing,
1:13:47
their features, right? Key features. Okay, there we go. And then we talk about, okay, best alternatives. Boom.
1:13:52
Our own product and a bunch more. So now when the AIs are skimming through our site, skiming because this ranks on
1:13:58
Google as well, and this is indexed in Google, when they're in skimming through Google and getting all this information, you'll know, okay, so here's 10
1:14:04
alternatives to uh this tool, right? But again, we're giving info, we're giving context, we're positioning ourselves as
1:14:11
an alternative to this tool. We have a bunch more blog posts like this. For example, we have this one right here,
1:14:16
the I think this latest one where we tried uh 30 different AI writers. So
1:14:22
there's a world where in which people are searching for prompts related with this. So for example, uh testing AI
1:14:29
writers or best AI writer based on testing, right? Based on results and we have this long video, right, which again
1:14:34
the LM's taking the transcript and take all the info and take all this right here into account to recommending our tools and all the other tools. We'll
1:14:40
give input to these LLMs. And by the way, now on YouTube, you can enable a setting to let uh LLMs, I guess, uh read
1:14:47
through the transcripts of your video and use your user information, excuse me, to the results they provide to uh
1:14:53
enrich the results they provide. This is a very new feature that only showed up, I think, two weeks ago, which I of course enabled, right, into all our
1:14:59
YouTube channels because again, as I said before, right, some of these LM recommend our YouTube channels. And so
1:15:05
if these LMS can access this video transcript where I talk about what our
1:15:10
product is, what it isn't, all this feature and maybe I haven't written a blog post about this or a tweet about
1:15:15
this or a LinkedIn post about this. Well, it doesn't matter because I've made a YouTube video about this which the LMS can read through what I'm saying
1:15:21
there. That's recommending my own site. Okay? And so again, this is the classic uh SEO strategy right here, which again,
1:15:28
I'll leave a link down below for for how to how to implement this strategy because it's it's super important. It actually does work. But again one
1:15:34
through four is a classic SEO strategy and please do watch this video which go over goes over step by step how I implement the number four which again is
1:15:41
writing blog post with alternatives speaking about competitors talking about their own features right because even if
1:15:47
right even if you don't show up right your site can show up for your
1:15:53
competitor's brand names for example in this blog post I talk about this competitor right this has great info
1:16:01
about my competitor it talks about what they are right. It talks about if they're free, talks about their pricing, has links to their site, talks about
1:16:07
their bundles, talks about all the stuff, talks about all their key features. So, if someone is looking for
1:16:13
to learn about this competitor, searching for on these LLMs, well, they
1:16:19
can the LMS can give info on this, but the source, right, this thing right here, which gives they give out the
1:16:25
sources, the source can be our own blog post. So again, you can rank for your
1:16:30
competitor's brand names and keywords because the info you're providing to these LLMs is so good that they have no
1:16:37
choice to take in that info. Hopefully this making sense. Again, in all essence, just write a blog post about about your competitors. And if people
1:16:44
are searching info about your competitors on these LLMs, well, if you have the best info about their the competitors, well, these LLMs will give
1:16:52
info on the search query that they're searching for here. And as the as the reference right here, they'll link to
1:16:58
your blog post. Okay? Same thing for Grole. They give you links to the blog posts. Hopefully, this makes sense. So,
1:17:04
it's not just about optimizing for your own stuff. It's optimizing for your competitor stuff because if you can
1:17:10
optimize for their stuff better than them, well, yes, when people are looking for their brand names on these LLMs,
1:17:15
they'll get info about their brand names, but the reference where that info was taken from was our own blog post. So
1:17:21
people then click the click the the reference, go to our site, read about the the competitor and then oh wait,
1:17:26
this is a blog post about alternatives. What's this? So again, another way to gain more traction. So don't optimize
1:17:32
just for your stuff. Optimize for their stuff. And this is what all this number four strategy in this 30-inut video is
1:17:39
all about. It's based on that. Okay? Creating alternative pages, comparison pages, and information pages. Oh, I
1:17:44
forgot to mention that down here in perplexity, you'll see that there's a couple of related uh queries right here
1:17:49
or which you can click right and expand on it, right? Again, how does journalist compare to this competitor in terms of
1:17:56
SEO optimization, right? And it's taking the info from info on the web, right?
1:18:02
Again, all this stuff right here, it's not made up, right? It takes these questions because there's info on the
1:18:08
web based on them. So again, if you can optimize for some of these related questions, right, and create maybe blog
1:18:14
posts, create YouTube videos, create content about these questions, well, they're going to show up here and the
1:18:19
content of such questions will be taken from your own site, right? There you go. They even recommended one of my videos.
1:18:26
So again, optimize for queries people could search for, right? Whether that's features of yours, comparison, doesn't
1:18:32
matter, right? Optimize for that stuff because again, it will prompt you to uh to keep on going with the conversation,
1:18:38
right? Again, multiple things right here, journali, whatever, right? There's a bunch of stuff right here, which again takes info from our own site because we
1:18:45
have info on that right here. This is taking info from our own domain, right? It's taking info from our own videos.
1:18:51
Okay? So, none of this info is random right here. So, you got to optimize for questions people are asking and think
1:18:56
about second tier questions people might ask. Okay, that's it. Okay. Now, five
1:19:02
through seven, uh, number five is active branded social channels. So not just having social channels of your brand,
1:19:08
not just having Twitter or LinkedIn, having stuff that are posted actively. So Twitter, post on Twitter, YouTube,
1:19:14
post on YouTube, LinkedIn, Reddit. So have these social channels, but actively post on them. New new uh new fresh new
1:19:21
content, right? Again, these LMs are looking for fresh info. They're looking for who what's hot right now, what's the
1:19:28
best right now. Okay? Again, they have direct access to the internet right now. And if they they see right, they see the
1:19:34
number of brand mentions. They see this brand being mentioned heavily on LinkedIn, right? They see stuff going viral. Again, you got to be active as
1:19:41
much as you can at least or at least more than your competitors. Okay? Then active non-branded social mentions. This
1:19:47
is basically other people recommending your brand. Okay. So again, you have all your brand and social accounts mentioning you and then other people
1:19:53
recommending your brand. Maybe pay influencer on Twitter. maybe uh again other people that have used the product,
1:19:59
writing reviews on on on Reddit, writing reviews on a blog post, uh recording reviews on YouTube, uh talking about it
1:20:04
on LinkedIn, talking about it on Tik Tok. So active non brand mentioned again you'll notice that all of these right are all about brand because the bigger
1:20:11
the brand as I said before the bigger the brand right here the bigger the mention of the brand the more recommended you'll be okay and finally
1:20:17
back links well what a backlink is essentially in terms of SEO is is mentions or links about your brand in
1:20:23
other authorative sites for example a a Forbes linking back to your site right
1:20:28
uh Huffington Post linking back to your site um I don't know CNN right linking back to your site right a big YouTube
1:20:35
channel linking back to your site Right? A big influential LinkedIn guy with all his post index linking back to your
1:20:40
site. So backlinks, brand mentions, by the way, I'll I'll um I'll leave a link for this down below, which again just
1:20:46
show you the impact of links, right? We built uh 29 back links to this site right here. The traffic went from around
1:20:51
400 to 1,600 in just a few weeks. So this is the powerful link. Power of links, excuse me. I'll leave this case
1:20:56
study down below in the description and also leave you a link uh on how to build links. So if you open this up right here, it's basically a free guide on how
1:21:03
to build uh backlinks. So, let me just open this right here. It is a three-hour course, right, that teaches you how to
1:21:09
build backlinks that rank a site. This is a 40-minute video going over what backlink are, what backlinks are, excuse
1:21:14
me, how to build them, right? What to look for, right? This is a 22-minute video on how to build all these backlinks. This is a uh 15-minute video
1:21:21
on which type of backlinks I I I uh build. And this is a the case study. So, if you watch all this stuff, you'll know
1:21:26
how to build backlinks that have the exact effects you saw uh right here on this case study because the links that I
1:21:34
show you how to build in this free course are the exact links I built to this client that saw this amazing increase in 400 to about 1,600 a month
1:21:40
in monthly organic search traffic. Okay, so that's the final one. And again, main takeaway here is again LM only have the
1:21:46
info you give them. So, give them more info than what your competitors do. Pretty straightforward, right?
1:21:52
Hopefully, this was valuable. I know I I spoke a bit too fast and I maybe went a bit over uh too maybe too complex topics
1:21:59
or wasn't able to properly uh explain myself. Hopefully I was again to sum it up these take info from all around the
1:22:05
world right all around the web. So you got to make sure you get your mention every single in every single place. And then you got to make sure you you
1:22:11
optimize for prompts, not necessarily for keywords. Because again, the way in which people search in these new AI
1:22:18
search engines, right, these things right here, is not the same way they search for on Google or B, right? They search for prompts because they know,
1:22:25
right? And you know as well that they're not just there to search once. Most likely if they want to search once for
1:22:31
one thing, they go on Google. But if they know they want to have a talk back and forth, they'll search more than
1:22:37
once. And because of that simple thing, that simple change in mindset of, oh, I want I want to search more than once. I
1:22:42
want to have a conversation. The prompts they use are way, way different than the ones they use on Google. Again, they're
1:22:47
more or less the same thing. They're essentially keywords, longtail versions of keywords, but I want to call them prompts just to appreciate them because again, if they were to do the same thing
1:22:54
they do on Google, right? They just search, for example, for AI writer. Well, there's a lot of ambiguity. They don't know. The AI doesn't know if
1:23:00
they're looking for product recommendation, if they're looking for um how the how AI writers work, if they're looking for if they're safe,
1:23:06
right? that that Google doesn't know. Okay? So that's why there's a there's a big difference here. And so the way in which you optimize for these stuff right
1:23:12
here is through all these steps right here, right? giving as much information
1:23:17
about you and about the competition as you possibly can about you because again
1:23:23
it's the only way that these guys know how to recommend you and about your competition because well if you if these
1:23:31
um LLMs can recommend your competition and then the source of such recommendation is your own site where
1:23:36
you talked about them well it's another another way to have people come to your traffic to learn more about this stuff
1:23:42
all right so hopefully that was valuable in understanding understanding how LLMs work and how you apply SEO to them. It's
1:23:48
not really anything super special. It's all always about doing the classic SEO and then by default if you have a proper
1:23:54
classical SEO, you'll have a great um LLM or AI based SEO. And so now I want to play and now I want to play another
1:24:00
clip on how you leverage LLM JPT rock etc. specifically specifically, excuse
1:24:06
me, for local SEO because it's different, right? It's different different things we want to we want to achieve here. And so it's going to be a
1:24:13
clip more tailored solely to local SEO. So play the clip. So how do you get your business to be recommended or cited in
1:24:21
these AI search engines? Let's use Perplexia as an example, right? I just gave it a prompt saying, "Give me the
1:24:27
number of the cheapest plumber in Dallas, Texas." And it gave me this phone number, right? It gave me a few
1:24:34
sources and recommended that I also check the maps. Okay. Now, how do I make it so my business number shows up here
1:24:43
for this prompt, right? And all possible variations of this prompt because this
1:24:48
prompt is simple, right? Give me is what they want, the phone number of the
1:24:54
cheapest plumber in Dallas. So, it is plumber, the service, the location, the
1:24:59
location, service, modifier could be cheapest, most expensive, most luxurious, um doesn't matter, right? the
1:25:06
modifier and what I want. I want the phone number, right? So, with these four things, you can do an infinite number of
1:25:13
prompts, right? For example, uh I my house burned or my my toilet is clogged.
1:25:19
I need the phone number of the cheapest plumber right now. I live in Dallas, Texas. So, that's the exact same intent,
1:25:25
right? But the prompt is different. So, how do you make it so that for your how do you make it that these AI search
1:25:33
engines recommend your business for a multitude of search prompts that have the same intent? Well, I'll show you
1:25:39
how. So, again, note that there's a bunch of AI search engines, right? All these are are LLM based, right? Large
1:25:46
language model. Okay? And then the front end, right? Is it perplexity? Is Chat GPT? Is uh Grock the one from from
1:25:52
Twitter, right? So all these LMS taking data from all across the web. Now do
1:25:59
note that different products right give certain weights to to that data in in
1:26:06
different amounts. For example, Chatt is of course owned by Microsoft. So it's
1:26:13
only natural that they'll factor in data from Bing with more relevancy. Okay.
1:26:20
Twitter is owned by uh excuse me, Grock is owned by Twitter. So, it's only natural that when you search for stuff,
1:26:25
for example, what's the best AI writer for SEO, it it's only natural that it will give you right a lot of weight on
1:26:32
social posts posted on X. Okay, again, CatchPD gives a lot of weight uh to the
1:26:38
rankings and there's a high correlation between the rankings on [ __ ] and what they show you here on on GPT. Again,
1:26:43
only natural. It's not that they're biased towards information because all of them gather the information from all
1:26:48
the same places, right? They they have they have access to the whole internet. It's just that they give you give
1:26:55
different weights to the information from different sources. That's why the the the recommendations or the citations
1:27:01
are different. Hopefully this makes sense. Okay. Now, you'll notice here that on Perplexi, okay, let me just
1:27:07
close out of this. They have this little map right here. This is not a Google maps. Okay. Okay, this is done by a
1:27:13
company called Mapbox. A big big company, right? But they do not get their their data from uh Google Maps.
1:27:19
And this still I can go here and find a local business. I can call it up. Okay. Now, note that even though Chip doesn't
1:27:26
has this or um Grock doesn't have this, it will be soon enough that they'll have
1:27:31
like a certain map widget appear, right? It's this this is just evolving so fast, right? This is what how search will look
1:27:38
like on these engines. Now I need to be very careful with one thing is that I don't think Google search will become
1:27:44
obsolete, right? And if you want more of my thoughts behind that, go watch this video right here because I cover why
1:27:49
that is. U people will still be searching on Google, right? It's just they'll use these AI search engines in a different way because you'd never search
1:27:56
for this on Google, right? Because Google is not a conversational type site, right? These platforms GPT perlexi
1:28:02
are more much more conversational. So after this prompt, right, you you can say, "Ah, yeah, but I want a business that's uh blackowned or womenowned or um
1:28:10
that's uh dog, I don't know, dog friendly, I don't know, right? It's much more conversational." On Google, you you don't have that. So people will still be
1:28:16
using Google, right? They'll just use Google and GPT or Proplexi that are different products in different ways.
1:28:21
All this to say that the I expect that the all these uh AI AI search engines will have eventually a map solution like
1:28:28
Proplexity because they'll want to serve the local businesses. Okay, they'll want to serve local searches. Okay, now
1:28:36
again, this is isn't based on uh on Google Maps and Chet's one will most
1:28:41
likely be based on Bing's one. Okay, and Grock, I don't have no idea. Okay, because they don't have any data on
1:28:46
maps. Maybe they'll have some I don't know Tesla data for Tesla maps, Apple Maps, not too sure. Um, all this to say
1:28:53
that it's not just because you have your your business on Google. So not just because you have your uh plumber and not
1:28:58
just because you have your business listing here your in your GMBB listed here in Google my business right because this is a product from Google doesn't
1:29:05
necessarily mean that you'll show going to show up here why because these guys get data in from open street map
1:29:12
okay let me give you an example so I asked it where does Mapbox get their data from what's the best way I as a
1:29:18
local business owner can give it data about my business so basically they're getting data from OSM open street map
1:29:25
Okay, they get data in from Foursquare, Yelp, Yellow Pages,
1:29:33
okay, uh, Hot Frog, all of these local business local business directories. So,
1:29:42
it's only fair that when users are doing a local search, right, for a plumber,
1:29:48
that these ALMs will skim through the most trusted source for local businesses
1:29:53
in the world, which is, of course, Yelp, right? And they'll skim through this, right? They'll then find what's relevant
1:29:59
for the prompt you used, which in this case was give me a uh local plumber in Dallas, the cheapest one. If I search,
1:30:06
for example, give me a number or of a plumber that does this specific type of service. I don't know uh drain clogging
1:30:12
I don't know or drain cleaning right it will find it will it would read through the business name the reviews what the
1:30:19
review said the services section and find okay is this business providing this specific type of service right that
1:30:25
the user that's searching on my product wants me to give it info on hopefully
1:30:32
this makes sense so the way in which you show up here is just by and in this case perplexity because open max open map box
1:30:39
excuse me is by putting doing your site list in Yelp and making sure that you give it as much context as possible.
1:30:44
Making sure you ask for reviews, making sure that people reviews um uh reply say
1:30:50
what the service was. You reply with uh info of what the service did was. And I have this video right here which goes
1:30:57
over like a lot of local SEO stuff. It's like a 5-hour course. And this one right here, which just go over, I think just
1:31:02
goes over, excuse me, reviews, which goes over the whole thought process behind reviews. It's not just about getting reviews. It's about what they
1:31:08
say and how you reply to them because the the keywords you reply and the things you see on the reviews, all these
1:31:14
will be read by these AI search engines, right? And all the info they'll give you right here, right? All this right here.
1:31:20
This isn't here by mistake, right? This is here because they read through the info and found that this was the most relevant site for this. So, for example,
1:31:27
let's say I have a business right here, my business, and I have 1,000 reviews and all they all they say the same
1:31:33
thing. This is the best rhinoplastic clinic for women in Dallas. This is the
1:31:39
I love my rhinoplastic uh surgery. I'm a woman and I loved it. I'm a woman and I love rhinoplastic doing my rhinoplasty
1:31:46
here. I love doing my rhinoplastes for all my women friends here. Right? So these reviews are hyper relevant for
1:31:54
service rhinoplasty for type women in Dallas. So the AI will know, okay, these guys are mega relevant for this. Let me
1:32:00
just recommend this when I when someone searches for I want to do a rhinoplasty in Dallas. Okay, so it's all these
1:32:06
little signals from the reviews, from the replies you you put in the reviews, from the info on your site, of course,
1:32:12
right? The info on your site needs to be relevant, right? This is like classic SEO, right? When you search for Dallas plumber, this site shows up because I
1:32:19
mean this is relevant for SEO, right? And so the info on your site also needs to be relevant. The info on your socials
1:32:24
also need to be relevant. So there isn't that much of a difference between how you do SEO for the classic search
1:32:31
engines like Google and B and how you do SEO for AI based LLM search engines, right? Because the the principles of
1:32:37
SEO, if you do proper SEO, right? A lot of the things you do here like link building, having a proper brand, the
1:32:43
socials, the info on your site, the the classic SEO, all the things you do here will by default make you be optimized
1:32:49
for showing up on these AI search engines, right? Because again, don't forget these engines don't just pull
1:32:55
data out of their ass, right? They they they get data from what's online, meaning your site, your local business
1:33:01
listings on Yelp, your socials, right? All this stuff. And then, of course, they they phrase in the data and they
1:33:06
give more weight to different data based on who they're owned by. That's just uh the reality, okay? And um and yeah,
1:33:14
that's that's basically it, right? That's how you go about uh ranking on here. Make sure to put yourself on Yelp. Make sure to put yourself on Source
1:33:20
Square. And but if you're doing local SEO properly, you've already done this by default. I just want to give you the
1:33:25
behind the scenes on how this would actually be done because I haven't seen anyone talking about this before. And uh
1:33:30
I mean it's super relevant, super important that we understand how these things uh are done. Now, there's another
1:33:35
video I need you to go watch if you want to learn in depth the principles of the classic local SEO. I know it's a long
1:33:41
video. It's a 2-hour long video, but this teaches you every single thing in specific about local SEO because again,
1:33:49
this is all interconnected, right? Again, the the the classic local SEO will have an impact on your rankings or
1:33:56
my mentions on these AI search engines. So, please go watch this video if you have some doubts on how to do local SEO.
1:34:01
This is literally like a bible. It teaches you every single thing you need to do. if you apply what's in these two hours, I mean, you'll rank on the
1:34:08
classic Google and being maps and by default as well on the uh AI engine. So
1:34:14
again, I'll leave the link down below for this one as well. It's a full local SEO course teaching you all the basics. Super super important you watch this.
1:34:19
Okay, I know it's a lot of stuff, but if you want to learn, if you want to learn, excuse me, you got to learn all this stuff. So I'll leave it down below. So
1:34:24
please, please, please don't forget to watch this. I'll teach you exactly what you need to rank on Google Maps being maps and by default be positioned on GPT
1:34:31
and all these AI engines. So give it a go. All right, there you go. That's done as well. And now I want to play the
1:34:37
final one, which is a little small case study with a tangible, actionable uh step by step on what we did to rank or
1:34:44
to be mentioned or cited specifically on Grock, Twitter's um AI engine. So, I'm going to play it's a short clip. Again,
1:34:50
the whole goal of this is to get you to think about how we do stuff with actual things being done like on real business.
1:34:56
That's our So, going to play that clip here. It's the final one about LMEO. So, play the clip. So, I'm ranking first on
1:35:01
Grock in just two hours. And here's how. I say ranking, but this is more of being cited or being recommended because with
1:35:08
these new AI search engine, it's not really about ranking. It's about citations. Here you go. This is the post. And as you can see, it was posted
1:35:14
2 hours ago. And I did this as a test. I made a tweet saying this is the best AI
1:35:20
writer writer for 25 is Journal CI. Here's why. Linked to a video posted two hours ago. Okay, this was posted as you
1:35:27
can see 2 hours ago. And then my search query, my prompt was, "What's the best AI for 25?" There you go. And the source
1:35:35
was the post that I wrote. And of course, because Twitter owns Grock, of
1:35:41
course, Grock is biased where it gets info from. So not only gives us a recommendation here, so we'll link here
1:35:47
as well as a link down here. Post highlights on X about JCI. And this is
1:35:53
just from one post, right? Posted two hours ago. Literally two hours ago, right? Just imagine if you can
1:35:59
consistently be posting on Grock every day, every week, right? Eventually, Grock will be recommending again two
1:36:05
hours ranking first in just two hours. Super simple. Now, I mentioned they are
1:36:10
biased. This is because Grock, again, Twitter owns Grock. So, it's only natural that the sources Grock puts the
1:36:17
most value in are Twitter sources. For example, JGBT. Well, there's a high correlation between your rankings on
1:36:23
Bing and the suggestions here on GPT. By the way, rank force as well for this search prompt. others. Proplexity, for
1:36:28
example, Proplexity gives more weight to uh YouTube. A lot of the search prompts on Proplexity. Link out to YouTube.
1:36:34
Again, we rank first on Proplexity 2. Boom. Citation right here. Citation right here. Citation right here.
1:36:40
Citation right here. And again, GPT as well. We rank uh first right here. So, citation right here from the source. And
1:36:46
we're right here. If you want to learn how exactly how I do this step by step, go watch this video right here and this one as well. But this video you're
1:36:53
watching right now is just prog and how we are able to rank first in 2 hours. literally two hours and I think this was
1:36:58
even faster, right? I think as as soon as the post got indexed and because we have a verified account, I think having a verified account does help. We pay for
1:37:05
this. I think $20 a month, not too sure, does help because of course, just like
1:37:10
Google values more authorative sites and more authorative sites rank higher on Google. Well, Grock will value more info
1:37:18
coming from trustworthy, authorative, verified sources. So, that's why we're here. Again, 2 hours. It's super simple.
1:37:24
And so, give it a go, right? write a bunch of tweets on an account based off of search prompts you want to rank for
1:37:29
or be cited for and see what happens because it works for us and I'll give it a go. I'll do a bunch more prompts based
1:37:36
off of, excuse me, I'll do a bunch more tweets based off potential uh queries I think could be search prompts. Like for
1:37:42
example, I'll do a tweet on I'll even do it live and I'll record a video or you can give it a go once uh once you've
1:37:48
watched. Oh, never mind. I'm not logged into the account. Never mind. But yeah, just make a post on this and see what it
1:37:53
gives you because it just worked for us. And marketing is all about arbitrage. While this is working, go out and give
1:37:59
it a go because it just works. Plain and simple. That's how you rank first on rock. Try it out. Give it a go and I'll
1:38:04
catch you in the next one. Hey, it's me again. Just want to remind you that I have this done for you service where I will do your SEO for you. Again, like I

it's going to be the very first link in the description. Check it out if you want. If not, I'll let you keep watching. Cheers. Okay. So, now I know
1:38:54
we covered a lot of things, but hopefully the LLM side of things is now more or less uh in the bag. So you you
Building Backlinks (Off-page SEO)
1:39:01
understand like the concept behind it, how it works and also as well you saw some of these examples. So now you can
1:39:06
apply this to your uh your business. Now of course there's always a lot of nuance to this. Excuse me. And it's always
1:39:11
simple, never easy, but hopefully this was good enough info to get you to to get going. And so now uh to finish off
1:39:17
this video, I want to uh go over link building, which is again one of the three pillars of of SEO, which I think is very important. Again, if you feel
1:39:24
like there's something missing, please check all the resources in the description. They're going to link you to other YouTube videos where I teach
1:39:30
some of these concepts more a bit more in detail. Excuse me. For example, I'll leave a video on that goes into detail
1:39:35
on on page SEO. Okay? So, and a bunch more that that I've mentioned all throughout this this long video. So,
1:39:41
please go watch them because these this these are this is like a puzzle. These are multiple piece. I'm giving you all
1:39:46
the pieces, right? I try to put them all like on a on this video, but I mean
1:39:51
there's some pieces that aren't here which are in below in the description. So, please click the videos and go watch them. So get you get so you're able to
1:39:57
basically form the whole puzzle and have more or less of a road map more than hopefully what you already have right now. So I'm going to play a couple of
1:40:04
clips of uh link building and uh I want to start by first showing you a few results because a lot of people know
1:40:10
that they need links but not a lot of people like actually build them. And so I want to show you first a video on the
1:40:16
results and then a literal step by step on how to build backlinks. Um I'm going to show you how to build two types of backlinks which are the most um the
1:40:24
biggest bang for your buck. So the effort you put in in terms of money or time versus the outcome i.e. the return
1:40:30
that they get you in the rankings is the highest. Okay, which are guest post and niche edits. But again, don't worry, I'm going to explain all this right now. So
1:40:36
play the clip. Right, we are here. And so the very first thing I want to show you
1:40:42
before any tutorial is some results, right? Take a look at this one. This company went from round zero essentially
1:40:49
to over 10,000 in monthly organic search traffic mostly with link building. So, we built nine links between August and
1:40:56
September this year. A mix of guest posts and link in search. Don't worry about this. I'll let you know and I'll explain step by step what these are and
1:41:02
why you should be building these exact type of links because there's a lot of types of links you can build out. In my
1:41:08
opinion, in based on my data, this is the best type of links you can be building. Okay, so traffic went from
1:41:14
around 1K to 10K in just 30 days. This is the power of link building combined
1:41:19
of course with onpage and technical SEO. Here's another one down here. Right? Zero to 6,000 in just a couple weeks.
1:41:26
Right? This was uh 46 links per month. I'll go over what this is the R40 and I'll go over again the types of links.
1:41:32
But I just want to show you real quick the power of links in increasing the search traffic. 0 to 6,000 in monthly
1:41:40
getting search traffic. Here's another one, bigger company, more established one. 10K to 16K. Again, you can pause
1:41:45
the video here if you want to look at the the results in a bit more detail. Uh here's another one. 2x traffic in 90 days from here to here. uh five to the
1:41:52
six links links per month right from February to June this year. Okay, so these are recent results not years back,
1:41:57
right? This is today happening today. Uh here's another one 10K couple weeks. Uh and here's another one. This was um bit
1:42:04
of an old older one uh but from 0 to two 2K and 10K in MR. Uh and the results
1:42:10
were so impressive and SCM Rush commented saying impressive results because I mean the amount of time it took for him to grow the traffic, right,
1:42:16
was was insane. Okay. And so this is the power of links. Here's a bunch more. You can pause the video for a look at these.
1:42:22
Um, my goal here is just to show you as an intro that link building actually works and not just years back, but it
1:42:28
works right now today and companies and your competitors are using it today to rank their sites. And so, with that said, let's move on to the types of
1:42:35
backlinks you want to build cuz you can't achieve these results with just some regular backlinks. You need the
1:42:41
most powerful backlinks. And so, the types of links you want to build are these two, guest posts and niche edits.
1:42:48
So, you might have heard about these ones, but guest posts are essentially links placed on new posts. Let's say,
1:42:53
for example, I find this amazing website super powerful, super relevant, right?
1:42:59
Because these are the two main things you want with links, but I'll go over that in a second here. You want to be looking at power as well as relevancy.
1:43:05
But either way, let's say you find this site, and I'll go over exactly how to find these sites. But let's say you find this site and you want to place a link
1:43:10
on the site, right? A guest post is a link placed on a new post. So these guys right right here this brand will create
1:43:17
a new post on their blog on their marketing pages and link out to your site right a link to your site that's a
1:43:24
guest post a post as a guest now a niche edit it's similar right it's similar in the sense that the link also comes from
1:43:30
a a page on the site but it's a link placed on an existing post now they
1:43:35
differ in the sense that a guest post is again a new page on the site niche edit comes from a page that's already been on
1:43:42
the site for a long time it's an age article an aged page page, excuse me, and often times already indexed in
1:43:48
Google and sometimes even getting some traffic. So, these are the differences between the two. They're similar again,
1:43:53
but different at the same time. And this throughout the years, honestly, is the best combination that brings us the most
1:43:58
results. And all the stuff you see right here, this stuff, this stuff, all this is a combination of both niche edits,
1:44:04
right, and and guest posts, right? The two most powerful types of links. Uh if you want to learn what other types of
1:44:09
links there are, I'll leave a link down below in the description for a course teaching all this stuff in more detail. Uh but again, with these two, you should
1:44:15
be all set. Now, you might be wondering, what type of uh anchor text should I be
1:44:21
using, right? The anchor text is a little text you click, right, to go to the site. What should this be? Because
1:44:26
it can be a lot of things, right? It can be all this in fact, right? It can be uh let's say right here an example, right? Let's say my site is this one,
1:44:34
bakersbrotherpubling.com, right? My main keyword would be plumber Dallas. So this is your the main keyword, the keyword you want to rank for the most. Right?
1:44:41
Now we have a lot of stuff where we have branded anchors. We have naked link anchors, generic anchors, partial match,
1:44:46
longtail and exact match, right? These are all options that can exist here in your anchor text, right? Let's look at
1:44:52
this example. For example, again, my branded anchor would be my company name, right? With capital letter or not,
1:44:58
right? All capitals, all all small company name plus company, right? Brand names plus company, right? These are all
1:45:03
branded anchors, right? Your brand name as a mention. Then we have naked link anchors. So this is literally just your
1:45:09
URL, right? With the HTTPS or not, right? Link, naked link anchors. Then we have generic anchors like click here,
1:45:14
learn more, visit our site, see our services. So generic stuff, right? Then you have the partial match or longtail
1:45:19
versions of your main keyword. So if your main keyword is plumber Dallas, a partial match or longtail version will be plumber in Dallas, best plumber in
1:45:26
Dallas, right? Number plumber Dallas, right? Plumbing company in Dallas. So variations of your main keyword, but a
1:45:31
longtail version of that exact uh anchor keyword, excuse me. And then of course your exact match plumber Dallas is your
1:45:37
main one. Now again all of these branded, naked, generic, partial or exact you can use here when in your
1:45:43
anchor text. But the trick here is to know, okay, when to use each ones. And this is what I do, right? This is my
1:45:48
rule of thumb, right? I use branded 70% of the time, right? Uh it just just
1:45:54
looks more natural, right? Because if you if you were just building links manually, right, organically, right? Most your links will come from your
1:45:59
brand name. Guess how it works, right? Then naked URL, right? Then generic, right? Partial match and only around 1%
1:46:06
would be exact match anchors, right? Because the issue is if you flip this around, if you build most your links with uh so if you build like exact match
1:46:13
anchors around with 70% of sorry if 70% of your links are built with exact match
1:46:18
anchors most likely going to get penalized. to watch out for this. Again, you don't need to follow this like step
1:46:23
by step, right? Exactly these numbers, but use this as a rule of thumb. Meaning that brand anchors, if you look, if you go to HFS or any true who use, sorry,
1:46:30
you go to backlinks, right? You should have your branded anchors be way way um
1:46:35
uh more than your exact match anchors or your partial match. Okay, again, this is just a rule of thumb, right? Now, when
1:46:41
do I use each? Right? Because you can use this, right? But you don't necessarily need to use them on niche
1:46:46
edits and guest post. You can use them on all the other types of links I mentioned before. Right? Here's what I do. Right? Here's where I use each.
1:46:52
Again, if you want to learn how to build each of these unique types of links, all these right here are different types of links, right? I've just spoken about the
1:46:59
U niche edits and the guest posts right right here. But if you want to learn how to build these ones, again, I'll leave a
1:47:06
link down below in the description how I'll build all these, okay? But just know that here's uh here's my breakdown basically on how you use anchors for
1:47:12
each type of link. And essentially if you look at this is the less the anchor text has meaning right so branded has
1:47:19
less meaning than the exact match right I use them on the least powerful links so for the exact match anchors like the
1:47:27
exact keyword right I use them on the big boy links like PBN links niche edits
1:47:32
and the the most powerful links and oftentimes also I use guest post right here right the point here is that if you
1:47:38
are investing because these links are more expensive right than just links from social media these are basically links you can build for free Right? If
1:47:44
you're investing this much time and money in building these make powerful links, right? You want to make sure that you get the most bang for your buck,
1:47:49
thus leveraging and using right your exact match and partial matches on these more expensive, more powerful links. Not
1:47:56
to say you can't use your exact match on a social media link. I mean, you can, but it can be like a waste of time.
1:48:02
Right now, next up is the the structure, right? Right. How do I build this link building structure? Now, you don't just
1:48:09
want to build links to your homepage, right? Most links should come to the homepage so it looks natural, right? Uh
1:48:14
but you also want to make sure you build links to your money pages, right? These are the pages that let's say for example you have a service, right? Service
1:48:20
business, right? Is where people can call you to um book a book an appointment or something. If you have a um an e-commerce store, physical
1:48:26
product, right? This is where people can buy the product, right? Many pages are basically the opposite of blog posts,
1:48:31
right? A blog post is a page where you're teaching the person something. And of course, it links out to the money page to create this um stack where
1:48:38
eventually people get introduced to your brand via blog post that ranks on Google. They click through, they get introduced to brand, they go to your
1:48:43
money page and they buy something, right? But the money pages are basically like the CTA, the call to action pages. And you want to be building back links
1:48:49
to all these pages to the homepage, the money page, to the individual blog post page, and making sure these pages
1:48:54
interlink between each other so that the link juice flows through. So that when you build backlinks to this blog post, it links to this money page. So the link
1:49:01
quote unquote link juice flows through this page. and then to the other one. Okay? So, don't just build links to the homepage. Make sure most of them come to
1:49:07
the homepage, but make sure that you build links to all of your pages in a way that makes sense, of course, and link out the pages internally with a
1:49:13
proper internal linking structure. Um, then comes the fun part, finding relevant sites with great metrics that
1:49:18
we want links from. Now, it's very important. I highlighted here relevant and metrics for two reasons. Firstly,
1:49:24
relevant is if your site is about, let's say you sell water bottles, right? If
1:49:31
you sell water bottles, you want links coming into your site from other relevant sources about water bottles,
1:49:38
right? You don't want links from uh dog based sites or or or cars or motorcycles
1:49:43
or paintings, right? You want relevance. You want you want to link, right? If your site sells water bottles, right?
1:49:48
You want as many links from water bottle related um avenues, right? Whether
1:49:54
that's Wikipedia or this blog that just talks about water or this governmental agency that talks about water, right? or
1:50:00
this one that talks about bottles, right? You don't want links from guys selling cars or sites selling dogs uh or
1:50:06
or selling paintings because yeah, these can be powerful, but they're not relevant, right? And you want to have a
1:50:12
mix of relevancy, right, as well as great metrics, right? So, the best backlink you can have is one that's both
1:50:18
powerful, right? Powerful coming from the metrics and relevant coming from the relevancy. So, try and find a mix of
1:50:26
both. Now, this all always this often times is not possible, right? You're have you're going to have to either choose power over relevancy or relevancy
1:50:33
over power. But when you whenever you can, right? Try and find a link that's both powerful and relevant. That's the
1:50:38
single biggest thing. Now, how do you find these sites? Well, very first thing you can do is just go to Adress or any
1:50:44
other tool and paste your competitor's URL here. Go out, type your keywords on Google. So, to go to Google, right? Type
1:50:50
in your keywords, right? And see the top 10 sites who are ranking for your keywords, right? Because those are your
1:50:55
competitors, right? Those are rank those guys are ranking for the keywords you want to rank for. Take those 10 sites, paste them here. Go to the back links
1:51:02
right here. Click backlinks and see their backlinks, right? See the sites they're ranking for they have links
1:51:08
from, right? Make a list. Use Google Sheets, use Excel, make a list, right? And look at all these sites. Then filter
1:51:14
through and see, okay, out of all these sites, which ones are actually relevant and which ones have great metrics.
1:51:19
Ideally, you'll be looking at a DR, a domain rating of at least at least 20 bare minimum. Anything below that isn't
1:51:26
really like a a very good site. So look at this and search for the DR metric right here. DR40 domain rating. Okay.
1:51:32
Anything below that I mean not really good. Now if you can find relevancy and
1:51:37
great metrics then go for those links. And when I say go for those links, you simply do this, right? You go to the
1:51:43
site, email the site owner asking if they accept payment for backlinks, right? Then ask them what their
1:51:50
processes are, right? We just ask, email them, hey, I notice you have a link, you link out to this guy, right? Uh, how
1:51:55
much do you charge for a link placement? How much do you charge per guest post, per niche edit, right? Ask them, get a
1:52:00
conversation going, right? And pay them to do it. Do that basically. Wait for confirmation, payment, and waited for it
1:52:07
to be live. That's basically it, right? nail nailing down this super quick. It's basically it. Okay, that was pretty cool. And now I want to give you the
1:52:13
step by step. So, it's going to be a bit of a long clip going over the step by step on how to build these links. Literally litual quite literal step by
1:52:19
step. So, let's break it down. I want to show you step by step how you can build literally unlimited backlinks using AI
1:52:25
100% for free. Okay, these ideally will rank your site first and fast. The links sort of will look like this, right?
1:52:31
These are actually quality links, not some just some shady type of links. you're actually going to be building valable links that actually move the
1:52:37
needle and rank your site higher. Now, the types of links we're going to be building that I'm going to teach you how to build again for free unlimited with
1:52:44
AI are guest posts and niche edits or there are so-called link insertions. Now, quick overview. What are these two?
1:52:51
So, a guest post essentially is where this is your site right here, right? And
1:52:57
there's this site, let's say your site is about dogs, right? There's this blog about uh dogs too, right? and you reach
1:53:03
out to them, right? Because they have multiple pages on their site, multiple blog posts, they get a lot of traffic, right? About dogs. And you reach out to
1:53:10
them and ask them, listen, how much do you charge to have a blog post written
1:53:16
about XYZ? And write it all for me. Add images, add videos, add links, right?
1:53:21
And link back to my site. Right? This is a guest post, right? You are posting as
1:53:26
a guest on their site and for that they ask you for money, right? That's a guest post, a new blog post, right? Now, niche
1:53:32
edits link insertions are a bit different. It's where you uh of course reach out to a site still, but instead
1:53:38
of asking them to write a whole new blog post, you just ask them to insert a link
1:53:43
back to your site in an already existing blog post of theirs. Right? Again, the difference is that with a guest post,
1:53:49
you are writing a brand new piece of content, right? With the link insertion or also called niche edits, you're
1:53:54
inserting a link in an already existing article, right? That's the main difference. Now, they're both good, right? Link in searchions are good
1:54:00
because they supposedly already are indexed. They're already uh posts with traffic with authority, right? And you
1:54:07
link out to your site. Again, already index. It's great. Guest posts are great because they're also a new information,
1:54:12
right? You're posting new information, which is also good. So, both work. I recommend building both, right? That's what we do. So, yeah. Now, how do you do
1:54:19
how do you do this? It's using simply search prompts. You're going to use search prompts to find the best sites to place links on. And I have here a list.
1:54:26
I'll leave it down below in the description. If I forget, let me know. But essentially, we're going to be using these search prompts in Google to find
1:54:31
the best sites to post uh links on. Now, I also want to go over how to find the
1:54:36
sites, what to look for, what not to look for, bad sites, awful sites, and great sites. Okay? So, let me break down
1:54:42
that for you right now. And after that, I'm going to tell you how you can leverage AI to automate all this and
1:54:47
essentially basically to write valuable content that the site owners actually want to post. Because if you are
1:54:53
reaching out to them to build guest posts, you want to write your the content, right? you want to have full control over the over the content that
1:54:58
they're posting on their site. But more on that later on. Right now, I'm just going to show you exactly how to look for the sites, right? What not to look
1:55:04
for. It's very, very important. You don't want to be building, you don't want to be building, sorry, uh, bad links. So, let me go over that real
1:55:09
quick in my other tab, and I'll be right back. Okay, so we're here. The first step you're going to want to do is write the following text in URL, write for us,
1:55:17
and then your niche. Right. I'll leave a list in the description for a bunch of these prompts you can uh use because you
1:55:25
can use different ones. You can use guest post. You can use a bunch of them. Again, I'll leave a link in the description for different ones cuz
1:55:31
different prompts will find you different sites. But for this video sake, let's just go with this one, which is quite simple. So, let's say your
1:55:37
niche is lawyers. Let's do niche lawyer. Okay? And then hit search. Now, I'll go
1:55:43
over what these little boxes are right here. Uh they're called the mosbar, but I'll go over that in just a second. But
1:55:50
when you write this, here are a couple of sites, of course, not all, that in theory will allow you to write for them
1:55:57
as the prompt says, right? So, let's just take a look. And this is exactly how we do it, right? Let's see here.
1:56:03
Okay, so this site is a lawyersource.com.auu. And they seem
1:56:09
pretty credible, but we'll go over but we'll go over the site, the traffic, and the matrix in just a second. But as you
1:56:15
can see right here, we find a guest postmission guidelines. Every single one of these sites should have some
1:56:20
guidelines. The amount of words, the image you need to include in the post, no promotional content, whatever. Again,
1:56:25
you can read all this. Then, of course, they have instructions on how to submit it. Super straightforward. Just email this email. Okay. Now, let's say this
1:56:32
one. This is another site. This one looks a bit more spammy. I see a bunch of ads. I see. Yeah, this one looks a
1:56:37
bit more more spammy than the other one. Has a bunch of different categories. So, this wouldn't be a site where you'd want
1:56:43
to place a link on. Of course, you can look at the metrics right here. And this is where the Mosbar comes in. This is the free way because this is an because
1:56:50
this is a free extension. Anyone can download this uh this Chrome extension. That's as you can see here, just go to
1:56:55
mos.com or write mosbar. I can even show you mosbar and it's a free extension
1:57:01
which you can download for free, right? And basically this allows you if you're doing this for free, if you're not using a paid tool, which again I'll explain to
1:57:07
you in a second how how we do this with the paid tool. Allows you to see basically the metrics of these domains,
1:57:12
right? But let's look for a couple of more ones. Let us see. As you can see, PA39, DA59. This one looks like a good
1:57:21
site. But again, yeah, as you can see, something to take note and you'll learn about this the more you do it is that
1:57:27
these sites that have a bunch of different categories are not the sites you want to go for cuz these sites are basically farming uh paid posts, right?
1:57:34
Cuz they have all the categories, they accept all the niches, they just want to make money, right? So, I wouldn't go for
1:57:39
these super generic sites. I would go for niche sites because after all, you're building niche edits, right? The
1:57:45
site needs to be niched down. So, there's three things you need to worry about. The site niche, the metrics, and
1:57:51
if it gets traffic because, of course, if you're having all this work, you want to make sure that the link is placed on
1:57:56
a niche site one with high metrics, and that on the page that your link will be placed, it is a page with traffic. And
1:58:03
this is something you cannot really check for free, right? using the MOSBar or any other tools, you cannot really
1:58:09
check the traffic of a certain page for free. Not that I know of to be honest. But this free way allows you to go very
1:58:15
far, right? Allows you to find sites that are actually accepting guest post. For example, this one, if you're in the lawyer niche, this one accepts guest
1:58:22
post and niche edits. Allows you to find the metrics, but not traffic. Now, this one, as we saw before, allows for guest
1:58:29
posts. But now, one thing we want to do, of course, is create the actual post, right? We have to write the actual guest
1:58:35
post. And I'm going to show you how you can do it and making sure that the post is actually very very valuable. And not
1:58:42
only that you benefit from the link juice, right? But also maybe because the
1:58:47
post is that good, you can also try and rank the guest post on Google. So it's two in one. So here's how you do it with
1:58:54
AI. Okay. So first I want to show you how the actual posts can look like if you actually do them with AI. Everything
1:58:59
you see here is all done with AI. The featured image, the table of contents, all the content structuring, right? the in article images, there's internal
1:59:05
links linking out to other pages on my site. There's external links linking out to other authorative sources, bullets,
1:59:11
tables, quotes, even of course in article videos that are relevant to what the content is about. Now, what you see
1:59:17
here is an actual valuable post, right? Guys wanting to or website owners wanting and accepting guest posts want
1:59:24
of course the highest quality type of post, right? And so, yes, you can do all this with a with manually, right? But
1:59:29
it's going to take you a lot of time. Yes, you can pay someone, but it's going to take you a lot of time and money. Or you can just use AI to generate all
1:59:36
this. This costed 80 cents, by the way. 80 cents, less than a dollar. Okay? So, I want to show you how to do this, but I
1:59:41
want to hammer it home that it's important to make sure that if you're building links on these sites, right, if
1:59:47
you're building guest posts, you want to make sure that first, right, number one, the site is good. So, great metrics,
1:59:53
great traffic, all that as I explained before. but two that the post you are posting that links out to your site,
1:59:59
right, is an actual valuable post. Again, like we see here with images, videos, links, tables, right? All this
2:00:05
because again, you want the site where the link is coming from to be great. You
2:00:11
want the post as well from where the link is coming to be fantastic. Okay?
2:00:16
So, don't neglect the post where your link is in. Don't do this. Okay? It needs to be hyper hyper quality and
2:00:22
hyper relevant. Of course, the higher relevancy the better. Okay, so here's how to do it. Go to tryjournalist.com.
2:00:28
Uh you get it for free, right? By the way, is there's three articles free. If you want to use it for free, you can. If you want to pay for it, like I said,
2:00:34
it's just 80 cents. Okay, 80 cents for one article. Super cheap. And it works like as I told you before. So what you
2:00:39
do is just go here to generate articles, right? And this is the input you give to the AI. Okay, in this case, and of
2:00:46
course, forgot to mention, the better the input, right, the better the output. Okay, so that's why the input's quite long. Now you choose just choose how
2:00:52
many articles you want. For this case, you're going to just choose one. I mean, if you're building multiple links, multiple guest post, you might want to choose five, 10, whatever, right? But
2:00:58
just choose one for now. Now, I recommend you add videos to your articles. Okay? So, you enable this, right? You can enable and it will do
2:01:04
automatically. So, it will write it will write the whole article for you, right? Will write the whole article. Then it
2:01:10
will go on YouTube and find, okay, what's the most relevant video we can add to this article that makes sense
2:01:16
according to the context of the article. So, just enable this and it will do it automatically for you. If you want to add your own videos, right, or manually,
2:01:23
you can just type them here. Okay? But I recommend just do it manually, automatically, sorry. Then images. You want to make sure you add both a
2:01:29
featured image to the post and an in article image. Again, you want to make sure this post is fantastic. Okay? Now,
2:01:34
you can use AI images, right? You can use organic B images, stock photos, or you can use your own custom images. If
2:01:39
you do choose AI images, you can even select the prompt right here, right? But you can play around with this. Not important. The most important part right
2:01:45
here is that you choose and enable have articles with featured images and in article images. Okay? Then external
2:01:50
linking this is where essentially don't don't make this it's not confusing right this is where right in the post we are
2:01:57
writing right with with the featured image the table of contents right the content structure the in article images
2:02:02
the in article videos external links are links linking out to other external authorative sources in your niche for
2:02:09
example let's say this an article about finance right and talks about the best stock picks for 2024 we might want to
2:02:15
link out to Investopedia we might want to link out to um Techrunch maybe Bloomberg, right? And again, this
2:02:21
article, remember, this article is going to be posted as a guest post on this amazing site. So, or as a guest post,
2:02:28
right? And the idea is to have links both to your site, of course, but also external links to other authorative
2:02:34
relevant sources, right? You want to make sure that you have external links on the posts. This increases the authoriveness and relevancy of your
2:02:41
article, right? Because you're fermenting whatever it is that you're saying with sources. Okay? Super important. Now, there's a bunch of rules
2:02:47
you can set here. Here I won't back flip into this. Quite simple. Just read what what they are. If you have any questions, ask them in the comments or just watch this video. It's quite quite
2:02:53
straightforward, right? You want to enable this. Okay. Then internal linking. This is where of course I mean
2:02:58
the whole goal is to have your guest post on this site, right? A guest post linking to your money site, okay? To
2:03:06
your own site. Now, in this guest post, in this article, right, you want to have a link to your site, right? But you
2:03:12
might want to have multiple, right? I recommend you just have one, but if you want multiple, you can set this up right
2:03:17
here, internal linking, and it will link out to other pages on your site, right? Automatically. So, we will write the
2:03:22
article, right, and place links automatically inside it to your homepage, to your contacts page, to
2:03:29
other blog posts of yours if it makes sense, right? To your um uh services page, right? Again, this is important.
2:03:36
Ideally, I mean, one link is enough. So, one link per guest post is enough, but
2:03:41
if you want to add more, you can. So if so just add this right here and you're you're set structure I would I would
2:03:47
enable disable enable sorry all these sections I would make the article length medium is good enough right uh I would
2:03:53
add a call to action if you have a product you're trying to promote directly if not doesn't really apply here I would automate the headings I
2:04:00
mean you can write them manually if you like and then just create an outline for this but I just for this sake I would just automate all this um formatting
2:04:07
I'll leave bold words on I'll leave quotes I'll leave list I'll leave tables too knowledge I would connect this to the web right so that content on the
2:04:13
guest post is up to date. Okay, very important. Um, you can connect knowledge base if you'd like, but I won't dive
2:04:18
deep into this right now. Uh, in terms of content, I mean, of course, choose the the target language. If you're ranking for if you're building links for
2:04:24
a Spanish client or a Spanish site or Portuguese or Greek, whatever, choose the correct language. If it's just English, just choose English, right?
2:04:30
Make sure you select the target country. If you're trying to rank a site in the US, make sure it's US, UK, wherever, because these countries do speak
2:04:36
English, too. But again, make sure you target the correct the correct one. Creativity levels. You can play around with this if you like. You can change
2:04:41
the voice. You can change the point of view. You can change the formality. There's a bunch more stuff right here, but this won't really apply to what you're doing. And then, of course,
2:04:48
generation mode. We of course want a blog post. We want to generate it based on titles. Just write your blog post or
2:04:54
your guest post guest post title right here. Make sure to within the title, right? Include your keyword. Okay? Very
2:05:01
important, right? And then just have the old title right here. Again, if you're if you came this far, most likely you already know what title of your post is
2:05:06
going to be. If not, no worries. But again, make sure that you include the title the keyword in your uh title. Okay, making sure that the the title is
2:05:14
relevant to what you're trying to rank for. Okay, so that again we it's all about relevancy, right? You want the
2:05:19
site that's linking out to you to be relevant. You want the actual post to be relevant and for that the anchor text
2:05:26
needs to be relevant, the links need to be relevant, the images, the title, everything needs to be relevant. The more most important thing here is
2:05:31
relevancy, right? Because the perfect backlink is one that's both relevant plus powerful. Okay? So whenever you can
2:05:38
make things more relevant to your niche, do it, right? And then just click generate, right? And it's going to happen. It's going to generate an
2:05:43
article like the one you saw before, right? The one, this one that I showed you was for the dog niche, but I mean this works for any single niche, any
2:05:49
single language again. And then you just take this, right? You can copy it like so. Or you can just um export it right
2:05:55
here uh as such, zip it, and send it over to the guys. Okay, that's literally it, right? That's how you use AI to
2:06:02
automate the whole writing process. Again, this costed 80, super cheap. And that's basically it. Now, I also want to
2:06:07
show you a paid version because for now, what I showed you was a a a free version, right, to find the pose, the
2:06:13
side story, and actually reach out to them. I want to show you a a a paid version, which it's the one I use, and I
2:06:18
see more success with it. So, let me just go back to my other tab and go over exactly what that is and how that works.
2:06:24
So, again, this is the free way that allows you to find sites using these prompts. Again, I'll leave a link in the
2:06:29
description where you have a bunch of these different prompts. Uh, it allows you to find the sites that are actually accepting guest post or niche edits.
2:06:36
Allows you to find out the metrics of the sites 100% for free. But now I want to show you the paid way which will
2:06:42
allow you to find actual pages with traffic where you can put your links on. And even better, I'll go over a broken
2:06:48
link building strategy you can use to often times get links for free. So the
2:06:53
paid method involves using HRES. And Hrefs is kind of a pricey tool. I think the lowest package is around $100 per
2:07:01
month, but uh it's a super super valuable tool and you can do a lot with it. But let's just go over how to find
2:07:07
proper niche added opportunities. So let's paste in here the site we were looking at before and let's see what it
2:07:15
shows us. Now there's two ways we can do this. So there's two ways how we can find pages on this site where we want to
2:07:22
put links on. The first types of pages are pages that have strong backlink profiles and the second types of pages
2:07:29
are pages that have a lot of traffic. Now, of course, you want to have a mix of both traffic and link juice. But
2:07:35
sometimes it can happen that either you cannot find a page with both traffic and link juice or that the site owners are
2:07:43
not offering a paid posting on certain types of pages that either have high
2:07:49
traffic or high link juice or both, right? If that makes sense. Now, first one, how do we find the pages on the
2:07:55
site that have the most link juice? Just go on here and click best by links. That will give you all the pages that the
2:08:02
site has and sorted by the amount of links and the power of those links. HFS
2:08:07
can be a confusing tool if you're just looking at this for the first time. So, I'll be brief. Uh so let's say here for
2:08:13
example this page right here has around a 183 uh do follow links has a UR of
2:08:19
nine and overall it's one of the top pages in this site for um in regards to linkages right so what you do you go
2:08:26
here look at the page try to find and try to understand if this page is something or is a place where you'd want
2:08:32
to insert a link to your site from and if your niche is lawyers I would assume
2:08:38
that this page would be great for you but of course this This is yet another part of these manual outreach and manual
2:08:44
link building is that you need to look at the pages and find out which ones best suit your site. If this one does,
2:08:50
then you just simply do what we talked about before is write just get in touch with them. In this case, they even have
2:08:56
a right for us page right here. Just get in touch with them. Send them an email asking for their pricing for their processes. Describe what you want. Make
2:09:02
sure that the email is short and straight to the point. Right? This is very important because you don't want to have a bunch of fluff in the email that
2:09:08
you're sending out. Right? So, that's a way you can find the best pages that have the best and strongest links on uh
2:09:15
a certain site, right? Because of course, again, you want to place your link on the strongest pages. That makes of course sense, right? Cuz of course,
2:09:22
you want to place your link on the strongest pages. Now, what if you wanted to find the pages that have the most
2:09:27
traffic? Super simple. You go to top pages, scroll down, and there you go.
2:09:33
Here you have the top pages by traffic. For example, we can click on this one right here. best immigration lawyer in
2:09:40
Brisbane. And this would not be a page where you could insert a link. Maybe you could insert here a face of your uh
2:09:48
lawyer's CEO on the of the company. Maybe if it is from Brisbane, I don't know. But I guess you can be creative
2:09:55
and try and insert here uh your link. I mean, all these links link out to this
2:10:00
uh lawyer firm. So, let me see if they are actually do follow or no follow. Let's see. They are do follow. So, I
2:10:07
would assume these lawyers most likely will be paying to be here. Not too sure. I don't want to insinuate anything, but
2:10:14
I think you can see the opportunity here, right? You can see that this page is getting traffic. And if you're a lawyer firm in Brisbane, you could ask
2:10:21
them. Again, you again, you have to get in touch with them with the site owner to ask them the pricing for a feature
2:10:27
over here. And in this case, because this is one of the top traffic pages, you're not only getting link juice
2:10:32
because this is a default link from the powerful site and this page is also powerful. If you're not mistaken, the
2:10:38
page has let me see if I can find the I can't really find the metrics right now, but but the thing here is that you're
2:10:44
getting a link from a page that has great metrics, from a site has great metrics, but a page that has a bunch of
2:10:50
traffic. So, you could get people going through your website through this page. So, you have to play around and try to
2:10:56
find a good balance between pages with traffic and pages with great metrics. Hopefully, this video helped. Hopefully,
2:11:03
now you know exactly how to find proper link building opportunities through
2:11:08
manual outreach. Whether there is niche edits or guest posts, this video showed you exactly how you can do it. And
2:11:14
finally, to finish off, and I almost forgot to mention this, is a way that you can leverage their broken back links
2:11:21
to try and get a free link from them. So, what does this mean? If you go on a hs, you go here to broken links. And I
2:11:28
do not have access to this because I'm not paying for the full high-end package. It is $200 per month. And for
2:11:34
me, is not really necessary for what I use Adri for. But if you are willing to
2:11:40
pay this much or if you maybe use another different tool that gives you access to a site's broken links, what
2:11:46
this basically does is it goes out, looks for all the pages on this site.
2:11:51
Say, say for example, the blog page looks for all the blog posts right here and tells you if there's any blog post
2:11:58
that has a broken link, right? Say for example, this linked to a 404 page or a
2:12:03
broken link. What you then do is you get in touch with website owner and tell them, hey, listen, I found that your I
2:12:09
read this article looks great. However, I found that there is a broken link on it. If you want to have here a great
2:12:16
source where you can link out to in replacement to the source that's no longer working. And oftentimes they'll
2:12:21
say, "Yes, sure. I mean, you're helping me out. You're giving me a new source. The other one is no longer valid. So, it
2:12:26
makes sense that I improve my site and make the links work." Some of them will ask you for money, but either way, it's
2:12:31
a numbers game, like I said before. So, it's always good uh and worth a try, right? And that's basically it in
2:12:37
regards to this secret uh quote unquote tactic uh for uh link building. Again,
2:12:42
just find the broken links, get in touch with them, tell them that you found the broken link, tell them that you have a new source, maybe more valuable source
2:12:49
to replace the old one that's no longer working, and see if they can do it for free. If not, see how much they ask for.
2:12:55
And there you have it. So, that's yet another way to leverage uh a tool and leverage broken link building to build
2:13:01
links to your site, right? So, we're back here and that's basically it, right? That's basically how you go out and build these links, right? Either a
2:13:07
guest post or a niche edit, doesn't really matter, right? Ideally, we're going to be building both. And for the generation of the post, I I would use
2:13:13
AI. It's just simpler. 80 cents, super affordable, and you get a properly written post SEO optimized with images,
2:13:19
videos, links, tables of contents, bullets, all this done for you automatically. So yeah, to recap, just
2:13:25
reach out to the guys actually post this on Google, right? Filter through the sites as I as I uh showed you, right?
2:13:31
Reach out to people and that's basically it. Now, it is a manual process. If you have VAS, if you have an agency, most
2:13:36
likely you can delegate this. But uh if not, I mean, you can do it yourself. But again, I recommend if you if you're doing this a lot to find a virtual
2:13:42
assistant or to hire someone to help you up with this either on Upwork or Fiverr, you can do this um quite easily. That's
2:13:49
it. All right. So, hopefully that was valuable. And now the last clip about link building which is going to go over a specific type of link, aorg link,
2:13:56
which are very powerful. Not a lot of people have, which makes them more powerful because of that, because it's a
2:14:01
unique link. And I'm going to show you step by step how you can build them. So, play the clip. Welcome. So I'm going to show you step by step how you can
2:14:07
acquire links from very powerful.org domains. So domains that are from organizations with ADR from
2:14:13
around 40 upwards to around 90 for free. So here's how you do it. Let's say for
2:14:20
example, let's choose a niche. Let's say my niche is for example uh pet grooming and I'm a I'm in Dallas. I'm a pet
2:14:26
grooming company. Again this works for any business anywhere. Just for example sakes I need to use this. Okay. So again
2:14:33
this is me. Let's assume for example this right here uh is my site. Okay, let
2:14:38
me just paste this. I don't know who these guys are. Let's assume again this is our site. Let me just paste it here
2:14:44
into uh age to see. Okay, we have at the moment um 3.1 backlinks, 3K backlinks
2:14:50
from 400 domains and our DR is 50 and we want to get more backlinks because the competition has a higher DR and has even
2:14:58
more powerful backlinks than us. And so how do we build the perfect backlink? So by now you know that the perfect
2:15:03
backlink is one that has very high metrics that's an M right and also very
2:15:09
high levels of relevancy right so this is the two things you want when you're building links metrics of course high DR
2:15:16
how you are uh high traffic right and relevancy of course is if our site is about dog grooming right we want links
2:15:23
to be pointing out to our site that are related with dog grooming right we don't necessarily want a link from a a a store
2:15:30
that sells or a car mechanic IC right linking us linking to us even though it might be from a powerful domain with
2:15:35
traffic it's a very irrelevant link so the perfect link again is one that's with high metrics high DR high you are
2:15:41
high traffic right and as well as relevant and the best links that satisfy these criteria are these from nonprofit
2:15:49
organizations so what you do just go to nonprofits let's say Dallas for example again I just click this open this this
2:15:56
is like a directory of nonprofit uh organizations in Dallas okay I just open up a couple There's this one for
2:16:02
example, Greyhound, whatever. Right? There's this one for breast cancer. There's this one for not too sure,
2:16:08
right? There's a bunch of them, right? I just pasted some here. Okay. Now, if we take this for example, the Greyhound, whatever, because it's in our niche,
2:16:14
just open up their site right here, right? Uh it's this one right here. They changed the domain. So, this is the the
2:16:21
site. Okay. So, again, domain, right? hyper relevant because this is a um if
2:16:27
I'm not mistaken right it's a adoption or non-governmental organization nonprofit organization right so in the
2:16:33
dog niche right we paste the right here so DR40 which is decent right domain
2:16:39
with real traffic okay right on our um a powerful trustworthy DDL okay what
2:16:45
we do and all these sites have this okay you go to their uh sponsors page because
2:16:50
every single one of these uh nonprofits has a sponsor page right and you See here on these sponsor pages, these are
2:16:56
all links to uh businesses in the area. For example, this is linked to, let's see, this is linked to a another
2:17:02
foundation, right? This is linked to, let me see here, some of these are links to foundations, of course. Uh this is a link to a to a business, right? To a
2:17:08
private business that sells dog foods. Okay? And so what you do quite simply and the way you show up here in the sponsor pages is just you reach out to
2:17:15
them and you make a donation, right? And in in return, right, they allow you to
2:17:20
be placed on here on the sponsor page, right? So again, yeah, you are paying for the link, you're giving a donation,
2:17:26
which goes to a great cause, and you're getting a backlink. So this is this is the best type of back you can have. Again, super powerful domain, super
2:17:33
relevant, and there's a ton of these, right? There's there's a ton. I just searched nonprofit talis, and there's there's infinite infinite, right?
2:17:40
There's 12 pages, right? It's insane, right? You can just go through these, open this up, right? Again, open the URL. See how powerful uh this is this is
2:17:48
gone. But again, open and see how powerful they are. For example, it's right here, right? DR60. Surely they
2:17:53
have a page for let's see, let's see. Donate, right? They have a page for donations. So, you can donate, of course. And surely they have a page for
2:17:59
their their sponsors somewhere around here. Oh, yeah. There you go. Impact and go to partners. Go to partners. There you go. All their partners right here.
2:18:06
And again, all this links to the business. So, I go here and click this this coffee for example. Again, a link
2:18:11
to this coffee brand, the private business. Right. There you go. What they did is they just most likely donated to this cause, which again is great. You're
2:18:17
donating to a good cause and getting a backlink in return from the uh sponsors
2:18:22
uh section. Super easy to do, right? Super easy to do. Again, for a good cause and you get a great backlink.
2:18:28
Short one today, but this is super valuable, right? It's insanely valuable and it's super easy to do. And it's a strategy that not a lot of people talk
2:18:34
about because I don't know why, not a lot of people know about it, but it's insanely powerful and this allows you to get back links that most of your
2:18:40
competitors will not have guaranteed. So you get exclusive backlinks that your competition doesn't have plus high
2:18:47
metrics. So high traffic, high DR, right? And hyper hyper hyper relevant,
2:18:53
hyper niche down. Okay, so that's it. And that's that guys. We are essentially
What Now?
2:18:58
done. Hopefully this was mega valuable. I I try not to hide a single thing like everything every single thing I know
2:19:04
about SEO I share with you. Like because again I'll be super transparent. My whole goal is to teach you every single
2:19:10
thing I know about SEO, ranking sites, and marketing so that when you know how to do it, you'll use my software, Arvo,
2:19:16
to do it for you. Now, before I go, I want to give you um I want to talk about three things super quick. Okay, the very
2:19:22
first thing is, of course, the software that I keep on mentioning called Arvo, which again can automate a lot of your
2:19:28
SEO for you. It's not just an AI writer. It just is so much more than that. I'll give you a quick rundown because I think it's super cool that I show you this and
2:19:34
I know I've showed you throughout the video, but one last time I want to show you three things. The first going to be a software. So you can generate
2:19:39
articles, news articles, Amazon product reviews, you can convert YouTube video to blog posts. This might seem not very
2:19:45
valuable, but for for example, if you go here to arvo.com, right, you just go to the case studies tab. There was this uh
2:19:51
French guy. Uh that in essence, he used this feature right here to convert a
2:19:56
bunch of YouTube videos into blog posts in French because Arvoc allows you to write in over 150 different languages,
2:20:02
right? Um and he was able to let me see if I can find it here. like get get almost to 5,000 monthly search traffic
2:20:09
just converting YouTube videos into French articles. So the videos are in English, right? He converted them from English videos to uh French-based
2:20:16
articles. And I mean, you can see the case study. It's insane. And so these little things work and they work so
2:20:22
well. Just a bit of a tangent right here because a lot of people just focus their efforts into the um into the English
2:20:28
speaking market, but there's a ton there's so many untapped markets that are not speaking English like Portuguese
2:20:34
speaking markets, Greek, Japanese, um I don't know, French, Spanish, right?
2:20:39
There's a ton of these non-English-speaking markets that often times are very underserved in terms of content. And so what in essence what he
2:20:46
did is just he took a bunch of English speaking YouTube very valuable YouTube videos where the info was mega valuable.
2:20:51
He used this to convert the videos into blog posts, converted it to French, and then put it put it out on the on his
2:20:57
blog. Now, he's not stealing info, of course. He of course gave uh mention to the creator, but he's just transforming
2:21:04
the video info into reading info, right? And putting it in French. I mean, it just works. So, that's a one of the cool
2:21:10
features we have here. Um, you can generate news articles. So, you can have, let's say you have you have your website, right? Let's say you're a
2:21:15
plumber, right? You have your about us, you have your menu, you have your services. Then here you have like a news
2:21:21
section. Let's see. Let's even say for example you're like a a Pokemon website. I don't know. You talk about Pokemon,
2:21:26
right? You sell like Pokemon cards, Pokemon whatever, right? There's this news section where you can have if you
2:21:31
open this up, right? It's a section with a bunch of the latest news about the
2:21:36
Pokemon market, the Pokemon games, whatever. What this will do, right, is it will give um topical authority and
2:21:42
authority in this space that Google understands that okay, this brand right here has all these Pokemon products, all these services, whatever. and then have
2:21:49
have this dedicated section that talks about solely Pokemon based news. So you'll become easily the author in this
2:21:54
space for Pokemon and all this like small stuff having like a dedicated section on your site about like whatever
2:22:00
niche news you have is achievable with this as well. Amazon product reviews the classic SEO articles. Uh the fact that
2:22:05
the articles I mean that you generate look look insane right if you go here to gardening I always give this example because it's quite visual. Um I mean yes
2:22:12
you can do this manually but I mean just the time this saves you like with the links internal external the images you
2:22:18
can change them around like hey let's test this add a car right I think I mentioned this this before right but it
2:22:23
takes to account the context of the image the context of the article and it supposedly will add a car in a
2:22:29
garden-like scenario. So let's see let's see what it does. And um all right there
2:22:34
you go. So again these are AI based images. You can use your own images if you like. Uh you can say add links.
2:22:40
Again I showed you this before but the point of this AI editor is just to you don't even you need to use Arvo to
2:22:46
generate the content. You can just import your content here and then use our editor uh to to add it to add links, add keywords, change things around,
2:22:53
right? Change your images. There you go. There you go. Boom boom boom. I just added these external links to my site,
2:22:58
my my paragraph just like that. I can transform this into a table, into a list, make a chart, make I can add
2:23:04
custom prompts. I can sprinkle in my keywords here. I mean, point here is that you can use this to save you so much more time. There's even this AI
2:23:09
assistant that allows you to like talk back and forth with the article. I showed you this before, but you can say, "Hey, add this paragraph. Add that
2:23:14
paragraph. Remove this. The text sounds too too beginner friendly. Make it more like expert friendly. Mention this car.
2:23:20
Um, remove this paragraph. Add this link." So, it's just as if you're speaking with Chachd. Like, it's insane. And it also automates your blog. So in
2:23:26
all you can like connect Arvo with your uh your website, right? And it does the
2:23:31
keyword research for you, right? He finds the keywords. Then it generates the content based off of these keywords,
2:23:37
right? Then it publishes the content to your site. All these automatically by the way it's publishing all these articles to your site on autopilot,
2:23:42
right? If you want and of course if we expand on these articles, all them will have of course a featured image, a table
2:23:49
of contents, proper content structure with in article images, in article videos, bullets, tables, quotes, uh internal links. So these articles will
2:23:56
be interlin between each other in a way that makes sense. External links. So if this is an article for example about finance, it will link out to
2:24:01
Investipedia, to Wikipedia, to uh Huffington Post, I don't know, all this done for you automatically. Also, it
2:24:07
automatically indexes the content on Google and it also does social media syndication or automation which basically takes these automatically
2:24:14
syndicates them to your LinkedIn, your Facebook, your Twitter uh on autopilot, which is great by the way for LM SEO.
2:24:20
There's lead magnets, which is one of my favorite features by the way, which not a lot of people use. I don't know why, but it's insane. Uh there's the of
2:24:25
course the um AI agent right where you add your site and it just scrolls through it and automizes your um
2:24:32
optimizes excuse me your technical SEO for you. So page titles descriptions can re image all text internal link schema I
2:24:37
mean I've shown you this before right gives you the current meta title and suggests a new one tells you why you can hit apply if you want to um the AI agent
2:24:45
to go into your site and change all this stuff. So this automates all your technical SEO for you it's insane and
2:24:50
that's that's the very first thing I want to mention is is the software if you want to give it a go. Um, if you don't have time for this stuff, well, we
2:24:57
I I developed this service which I mentioned before, which is a done for you service, right? It's 2K a month and
2:25:02
we guarantee a 25% increase in traffic over 90 days or you don't pay. Okay, so that's that's a pretty cool service. We
2:25:08
we use the software for you. You also get get access to the software, right? Full full features like with this price,
2:25:13
you get access to me doing SEO for you and full access to our software so you can use it for your other projects if
2:25:18
you'd like. And finally, we have the academy. If you have time to learn, if you can get our courses, which basically
2:25:25
if you purchase this, gives you one year access to our a full year plus lifetime access to all my courses, which let me
2:25:31
just scroll past all these results right here. Results, results, gives you all these courses, right? My uh gives you
2:25:38
gives you weekly calls, gives you one call with myself, right? SEO Q&A, my seven SEO courses, plus one exclusive
2:25:43

2:25:48
back guarantee and again you get one you get access to all this stuff for life and a free year a full year excuse me
2:25:54
access to Arvo. So those are the three things the software itself the done for you service and the academy. Guys thank
