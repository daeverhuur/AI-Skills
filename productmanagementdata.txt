hello everyone I want to start off by congratulating you because you have decided to invest time into learning
0:07
more about product management I think it's a great decision my name is
0:12
sorrow dubal and I'm going to be your instructor for this course I'll spend
0:17
over a decade in product management everything I know today is because of
0:23
people people who are nice to me my managers invested time in me and showed me all the tricks of the trade my peers
0:31
pointed me in the right direction towards the right resources because of them I got a chance to work
0:39
in B2B b2c high tech low Tech all kinds of great products
0:46
as more teams Move online and remote you might not be as lucky
0:52
so this course focuses on bridging that Gap and making sure that you're able to
0:59
not just survive but Thrive as a product manager so let's start off by looking at uh the
1:07
different types of people who will find this useful and see if you fall in that bucket an MBA student with product management
1:14
experience looking to break into product management through uh internship or a full-time
1:20
offer a software engineer or QA who works in technology and is looking to
1:26
transition into product management anybody who is curious about product management
1:32
or someone who is just looking for a refresher who will find this course
1:37
useful some people might might not find this
1:43
course useful at all if you're a Serial product manager who has done it all will might might find
1:50
this material a bit redundant all right so what can you expect in this course
1:56
we've divided this course into three parts in the first part we will learn
2:02
the basics of product management which will help us build the foundation for the next sections we
2:10
will start by looking at the different types of companies you will come across
2:16
B to B B to C SAS ivr platform there's
2:21
so many different types understanding what a product is and how
2:26
does it live its life just like us the UPS the downs and finally calling it a
2:32
day or morphing into a new Avatar the different types of users from innovators
2:38
to lagards your team that is the product team the people you
2:45
will learn from and you will lean in into so often the goals and kpis for your team
2:52
your role and responsibilities and how they will change as you grow into your
2:59
product role the great co-workers who will breathe down your neck for that feature that
3:07
they had been asking for a long time just kidding guys don't get scared
3:14
what does the life of a product manager look understanding product revision and how
3:21
it relates to product goals strategy and initiatives learning how to fail past
3:27
through the minimum viable product measuring what's important and how
3:33
no room for vanity metrics in our course
3:38
how to build your customer personas and conduct user interviews finding your
3:43
product Market fit yes the Holy Grail the product Market fit translating all of this into a product
3:51
roadmap breaking it down into smaller more actionable chunks
3:57
how to build these smaller chunks we will look at two very popular Frameworks of building
4:05
our products scrum as well as kanban how do you put all this into your
4:13
product backlog and make sense of it we'll look at the different meetings
4:18
that you will be having as a product manager namely the product grooming meetings the also called replenishment
4:24
replenishment meetings daily standards as well as retrospective meetings
4:30
and then when your update is ready how do you test it via a b testing or beta
4:36
testing we'll talk about how can you become a more data driven product manager from
4:42
the get go we'll introduce you to around 30 product metrics and will end part one
4:48
with a note on product launch and apis
4:53
phew that sounds like a lot don't worry we'll get through each topic one at a time
5:03
part two of the course gives us the opportunity to apply all the good stuff that we've learned in part one to a
5:10
product update and get our hands dirty learn by doing we look at a product and
5:17
build it together this in my opinion is the most fun part of the course and
5:22
finally part three where we will test you on all the great things that you've
5:28
learned in the course if you pass you receive a product management certificate
5:34
from desker that you can show off on your LinkedIn good luck and let's get started so why
Types of Companies & The Way they Distribute their Products in the Technology Sector
5:41
are we starting a course on product management by discussing different types of companies you can skip this section
5:46
if you want but if you're curious do hear me out there's a very valid reason when you go out and talk to different
5:52
product managers and I hope you're doing that to increase your network and stay
5:58
current you will some very conflicting accounts of what
6:04
each one of them does for the job and that's not because they're making stuff
6:09
up it's because they work for very different types of
6:15
companies and product management means different something different in
6:20
each type of company the list we're going to look at is not exhaustive in our in any particular
6:27
order but more so a collection of the common ones that you will encounter
6:33
you will often hear these terms being used interchangeably and sometimes incorrectly
6:39
but here we're not interested in dissecting the anatomy of companies all
6:46
I want you to do is to be aware of the different types of companies that might exist
6:51
and how they might decide to build the product service all value available to users so
6:59
let's get started there are different ways you can classify companies and
7:05
we're going to look at some of them the first one we're going to look at is classification based on the type of users it the first one is b2c which is
7:13
business to customers for example we eat burgers at McDonald's and we go to a
7:20
McDonald's store and buy it so it's a company selling burgers to us as users
7:27
so it becomes a b2c company the second one is a business to business
7:32
a business like Cisco for example which sells it products and services directly
7:38
to businesses is a B2B company classification can also be done in terms
7:43
of Licensing and delivery it could be on-premise subscription which is software that you install on
7:52
your computer almost everyone is moving to Cloud but on-premise software has
7:57
still got some use cases for example if the cost of switching to cloud is too
8:02
high or security is of extreme importance
8:07
people might choose an on-premise software the reasons though are still pretty
8:14
debatable so a conversation for another time you could also work for a company which
8:20
is a SAS on cloud which is a software as a service so it's a type of product you
8:27
buy where you are not responsible for maintaining or updating the product you pay money to the provider for the
8:35
service who in turn takes on the responsibility of doing all those things everyone has already moved or is trying
8:42
to move to Cloud these days and hosting on your applications and cloud is extremely easy the third type of
8:49
classification you can think about is based on the type of service could be an isv SI MSP or reseller
8:58
and isv is an independent software vendor it's a company that has decided to build
9:05
maintain and improve its software in-house and owns all the copyrights
9:11
this is a type of company where a lot of product managers work in the b2p space
9:16
the second type is SI system integrators
9:21
system integrators consists of a team of professionals who have diverse knowledge
9:27
and can bring together different softwares or applications together so they can talk to each other and enable
9:34
the end users to get their job done generally a lot of Enterprise companies
9:39
will hire system integrators to get all the different applications up and running in a coherent manner such
9:46
companies don't usually need product managers skills of a project managers
9:53
can come in handy for these companies the Third one that you want to look under this
9:59
type is the MSP a managed service provider it's like an Outsource ID
10:05
Department if you're a company who doesn't want to deal with all things technology you can
10:11
use them and focus your energy on strengthening your value proposition no
10:16
real work for product managers in msps the last one are resellers they sell
10:22
products of other companies as distributors or value added resellers
10:28
also car called Wars again no role for product managers in here while we're on
10:34
this topic we also want to touch upon the concept of platforms and Marketplace
10:40
there are lots of definitions out there of what platform and marketplaces are
10:45
one explanation might fit better to a particular scenario versus another I
10:51
have my own it's not perfect and probably doesn't fit well in every scenario but let's hear it out
10:59
you are a software and you sell to customers so now you become you are a
11:05
isv like we discussed now what you do is you start making your apis accessible to
11:11
users who can create their own workflows automations to meet their use cases
11:17
you've now become a platform next these users start building their own
11:24
applications using your apis and selling it on your platform to other
11:30
users you have now become a Marketplace like I said before just one way to think about
11:37
it I'm sure there are lots of others maybe more better more exhaustive ones
11:43
out there do share with the group if you know any so lots of different ways to build products up you might like one
11:50
versus another what product managers do in all these companies will be very
11:55
different from each other do you prefer one type of company over another or are
12:00
you keen on Crying Out product management roles in all of these something to think about before you
12:07
start applying for product roles so what is a product seems like a straightforward question
What is a Product?
12:13
right well maybe a century ago the definition of product has changed drastically over
12:21
the last few decades it has moved Beyond being just something physical to digital metaphysical and
12:28
Beyond is service a product is brand a product we can argue either
12:34
ways the definition of product has broadened over time according to me a product is
12:42
something that creates value now that something can be physical like a car
12:49
digital like an e-commerce website brand like an Instagram influencer or opinions
12:57
like review value can be convenience Time Savings
13:03
cost savings or just a good feeling yes you read that right that is also of
13:09
value a product might fall into one of the following categories you can label a
13:16
product as a disruptive Innovative product this is the first of its kind nothing
13:22
before it has succeeded that doesn't mean it hasn't been tried for example
13:27
there were lots of predecessors to the iPod but none like it that nail the entire customer
13:36
experience a product can be complementary to another they are built as ancillary
13:44
products that help or improve an existing product
13:49
or a product can be a substitute to another product which is basically a replacement to the product that
13:56
currently exists in the market like humans products also have their
Product Lifecycle Management Explained
14:02
life cycle to generally four stages to this life cycle and the length of time each product
14:08
stays in a particular stage might vary depending on different factors let's take a closer look the
14:16
first stage is the introduction stage you have an idea what do you do
14:22
you test it out to see whether there's potential to growth at this stage you don't want to waste
14:29
too much time into building out the product because its potential is unknown
14:35
we have five things that you should keep in mind at this number one is resources when testing out your idea you should
14:41
always try to find ways that don't take up too much of the theme's time this is
14:46
because at this stage the product's demand is not validated by the market and no one knows how much profit it is
14:53
going to make for the company number two is scope the scope of the
14:58
product needs to be limited to only what is needed to get the job done
15:04
no bells and whistles or fancy animations or major technical changes at
15:10
this state it is always better to buy or partner for the underlying technology
15:16
versus building it out from scratch unless technology is your main
15:22
differentiator number three is time
15:28
if it takes too much time to either introduce the product or test it then it
15:34
might cause challenges the market might have moved by then or new products might
15:40
have been launched so complete your product introduction and testing within the reasonable amount of time
15:47
number four is flexibility one of the key aspect of the introduction stage is
15:53
that you should be able to make changes to your product based on what you learn from the customer
15:59
your team needs to be flexible with changing the product based on evidence it gets from the market
16:05
and finally speed it is critical for the team to be able to make changes quickly
16:10
so that you can go out and test the new version of your product again and again
16:16
a great way to introduce new products in the market is by building MVPs minimal
16:23
viable products it enables you to follow the bill measure learn framework iterate
16:30
and focus on what's important more on that later now let's talk about the second stage
16:37
the growth stage your product has achieved product Market fit we'll talk more about pmf later uh
16:46
for now let's just say that you found the right version of the product that will be successful or so you think now
16:52
it's all about growing a to its full potential and taking it to the next level in this stage you need to make
17:00
sure that the product gets the right support to grow and reach its full potential the goal of the growth phase
17:07
is to get new users and a lot of them and if they pay right off the bat that
17:12
is great there are four different things that come into focus at this stage number one is building the right team at
17:20
the introduction stage you can probably make do with a really small team but growth requires you to build a great
17:28
team having the right team is critical because growth phase requires specific skills you need the people who thrive in
17:36
a fast pace metric driven setup and a itching to try out Innovative things to
17:41
bring more customers to you number two is uh creating capacity this
17:48
can mean different things uh in different Industries and products where when more people start using your
17:54
product you need to make sure that it is able to handle the sudden influx of
18:00
users this is critical and often neglected until your site is on fire or
18:05
things starts breaking left right and Center product managers actually play a key role in this prioritizing user
18:12
facing features is important but making sure that the back end and infrastructure is stable enough to
18:18
provide a seamless experience is equally important as a product managers you have to make sure that you balance
18:26
different features when prioritizing work don't worry we'll learn how to prioritize features later in this course
18:33
number three is marketing uh top of the funnel activities play a important role at this stage you will only grow if more
18:40
people come and try out your products it is important for the product manager to work very closely with the marketing
18:47
team and before the marketing team invests into creating marketing correct collateral and running you know ad
18:53
campaigns everybody should be clear about three things number one is who is the target user for
19:01
your product number two is what is the unique value proposition for the product
19:06
and three is which medium is the target user active on at this stage a lot of
19:14
companies especially the well-funded one often subsidize growth for discount coupons and other incentives that are
19:22
showered on the users to get them hooked through the products the pros and cons to this strategy again something
19:29
something we can discuss at another time my question to you right now is can you
19:34
think of two companies that you have interacted recently in the growth phase what tactics did they use I mean they
19:41
were the same or different and did they work on you let us know number four is pricing and tears it's
19:47
important to price your products such that people are able to see the derived
19:53
value that they get from paying for your product let's talk about product hearing as well for a minute uh there are three
20:00
things that you need to balance one is the perceived value that each tier provides price sensitivity of each
20:07
segment of customers and the problem that each segment needs to solve you
20:12
start out by making a list of all the features and functionality that your product provides
20:18
then create groupings of closely linked features keep in mind that each tier
20:24
should have just enough value to appeal to the Target group of users and the next tier should have
20:31
something something more something different that can justify the jump that kind of customers will take
20:39
to subscribe to a higher tune pricing has to be tested you will not get it right the first time you might also need
20:46
a feat here or a feed file that enables customers to experience the power of
20:51
your product without shelling out any Moolah this will further unlock Future
20:57
growth for your team this third stage of a product life cycle is the maturity
21:03
stage this is the stage where your product has established itself as a key player in the market
21:08
prospects know about it and it's really a matter of making sure that you are
21:13
making the right investments in the product product managers who manage product at this stake needs to focus on
21:20
three things number one improving retention during the growth phase you relentlessly work towards acquiring new
21:27
customers now is the time for you to make sure that those users stay with the company
21:33
for a long time you want to increase the customers lifetime value as much as possible while trying to reduce the cost
21:40
of acquiring them product managers need to make sure that the product runs without disruptions production bugs are
21:47
taken care of quickly and new features are built to satisfy the expanded use
21:52
cases for the product number two is keeping up with competition at this stage your product
21:59
has become the incumbent as in life new competition will rise to challenge your
22:05
position this my friend is evolution the product manager needs to find how are
22:11
the challenges in waiting to unseat you from throne which areas are they focusing on is
22:17
there an unmet need that your product has not focused on till now has the market for that need increase because of
22:25
which more companies are investing in it as a product manager you need to find answers to all these questions and build
22:31
out the product roadmap based on what you find to increase the life of your product number three is upselling when
22:40
you have a customer base that believes in your ability to deliver solid products then it becomes easier to
22:46
upsell talk to your customers and find out if there are any other related problems that are frustrating them is it
22:53
possible to expand the use case of your product to solve these problems and when
22:58
the customers pay for it the final stage of the product life cycle is decline
23:04
decline is inevitable it's the ultimate truth there could be lots of reason for
23:10
your products decline better Solutions in the market might have taken over you
23:16
became too complacent and stop listening to customers new breakthroughs in technology has made your product
23:22
redundant so what's the point then is every product eventually going to fail
23:29
well it depends on the definition of failure there is one thing that is under your
23:36
control though it's the speed of the decline when you say that your product is going
23:42
to decline that doesn't mean that it's going to happen overnight it's
23:47
not like you wake up one day and you have zero customers the speed at which your product declines and phase and
23:54
Fades into the sunset depends on you you have look at the early signs in the
23:59
maturity phase ask yourselves are more customers leaving than joining you
24:04
the first time this happens in your company it should set off the alarm Bells our customers leaving because they
24:12
found a better product us leaving because they're going out of business
24:17
we made it clear that decline is inevitable your job is to learn from it the decline will tell you how to slow it
24:24
down or it will point you to the next area of growth for your company so think
24:29
of decline as the phase which will help you find the next big thing to Pivot to
24:35
there are a lot of examples from the last few decades where products have
24:40
risen to the top and then gone past and a lot of learnings from them some examples that come to mind Walkman if we
24:48
do I calls and iPods give way to mobile phones the market for watches for
24:53
example slowly disappear with the increase in mobile phone usage and now
24:59
it's sort of making a comeback as smart watches hard disk has given way to cloud storage
25:05
email is still finding the good fight with messaging services like slack Netflix started off by selling or
25:12
renting DVDs by mail we all know what it is today now Netflix is beginning to
25:18
lose subscribers to competition after being the Paul Bearer in online content
25:24
shift from on-premise come cloud computing as a result most on-premise
25:30
solutions have either adapted with time and made the transition or perished
25:36
here's a great exercise for you to do why don't you do some research on all of
25:41
these products that we discussed and see if we can figure out the various points
25:47
in their life cycle in their Journey where they move from one stage to another
25:52
what can we learn from that as product managers do share with the group as part
25:58
of the product life cycle it is important for us to discuss the
Types Of Users
26:03
different types of users that interact with the product in 1962 em Rogers
26:09
developed the diffusion of innovation Theory it has become one of the most
26:16
popular ways to identify adoption of a product by users users can be classified
26:22
into five categories first one is innovators I know we all uh
26:29
would love to think of ourselves as innovators but innovators are people who
26:35
try out new things and ideas their motivation is the sense of adventure
26:40
that accompanies trying out new things they do not shy away from taking risks
26:46
and usually have an appetite for taking high risk High reward bets following the
26:53
innovators are the early adopters they are the ones to adopt a product right after the innovators not quite the
27:01
same level of risk appetite but they do adopt at a very early stage the early
27:07
majority follow the early innovators the adoption time is definitely longer than
27:13
the other two the slower and a little more cautious in your approach when evaluating different products following
27:20
the early majority are the late majority they adopt the product after a very
27:25
large part of the society has given its thumbs up to the product and finally other leg
27:32
Arts these people do not like change they are happy with the status quo and they hate
27:41
anything that disturbs it this group is the last adopt a product
27:46
and it happens when everybody around them has been using the product for a
27:52
while and they have no choice but to embrace the change if I were to think
27:58
about the category I fall under into they would be different for different kinds of products for example electronic
28:04
gadgets I say I'm a early adopter but it's something like a car I'm
28:10
definitely a league majority where do you stand which category of users do you fit into are they the same
28:16
for all kinds of products or do you also have different risk appetite for
28:22
different kinds of products we're talking about all these great things uh but before we move further you know we
28:28
need to ask ourselves this question why do companies need product managers like
28:34
what's the point let's talk about a hypothetical scenario you have an idea based on which you
28:41
started the company you had a vision of what you want to do go through you know complete iterations you're able to
28:48
successfully launch your product up until this point you most likely juggling you know sales marketing
28:55
product lots of different hacks at some point you won't have enough time and you'll have to hire people with very
29:02
specific skill set that can build on your initial vision and partner with you
29:07
to take your company's products to the next level of its growth
29:13
product managers will help you do that as you pass the pattern or be the voice
29:19
of customers in your organization to the product managers they will not only
29:25
bring the data driven approach to decide what needs to be built versus not but
29:31
they will also be able to bring together all the different stakeholders and get them excited about the various product
29:37
initiatives in the company that sounds exciting doesn't it so let's get to know
29:43
your product team a bit better in the next section let's start by looking at the organizational structure of a company if
Product Team Structure
29:49
you look at it broadly you have the CEO at the top with different teams of business functions reporting to him
29:55
common business functions that will come across are sales marketing product management design
30:01
engineering customer support customer success
30:06
organization structure can get really complicated as the company grows even as
30:12
the management keeps trying to remain as accessible as they can be or they were
30:19
in the early stages of the business for the purpose of this discussion we'll try to keep it simple
30:26
the head of various business functions report to the CEO their designation might vary depending
30:35
on the company they might be Chiefs VPS or directors designation doesn't matter
30:42
at least to some of us they all found or part of what is called
30:47
the executive team the set of people who play a critical role in setting forth the overall goals for the company
30:54
these goals are then broken down by the leader of each team
31:00
as to what it means for their respective teams this enables everyone in the
31:06
organization to focus and work towards the organizational priorities and stay
31:11
in sync with each other the product management team's role and responsibilities are derived in a
31:17
similar way starting at the very top let's get familiar with the product organization before diving deep into
31:25
each role like we said we've kept it super simple and we're focusing primarily on the
31:32
product Organization for our discussion generally the product team is a is a
31:38
very lean Nimble unit the structure will vary depending on the size of your organization for example for really
31:46
early stage start of maybe less than 10 employees the ca often is the product
31:51
manager and he works with the CTO to build the MVP as they try to find the
31:57
mark product Market fit as the company grows uh in from being a very small
32:02
startup to a small company maybe 10 25 10 20 25 employees a senior product
32:09
manager might join and to help the CEO to define the roadmap to achieve the
32:15
vision and take over some of the more tactical aspects of product management as the company grows further and becomes
32:23
a medium-sized company this is the stage where it the product organization really
32:30
starts to grow you know it could be led by a director of product management reporting to the CEO and might have
32:36
direct reportees including product managers designers and some other people
32:42
as well for very very large organization I'm talking about organizations with maybe
32:48
over 100 employees um you might have a chief product officer with you know different team supporting
32:55
to them there might be a product team or design team and a product operation team or a data team you will see different
33:01
permutations and combinations of these over the course of your career no matter
Product Team Goals
33:07
what the makeup of your product team is the major goals remain the same let's
33:12
look at some of the common goals for most product teams number one retention acquiring new
33:20
customers is not easy but losing them is that's why retention is important the
33:25
product team needs to identify problems that existing customers are facing it
33:31
can be a bar and an existing feature or the absence of certain functionality there will always be customers who leave
33:38
you but for those who don't you have to keep them excited about the product that they
33:45
use today and what the future roadmap holds number two is user acquisition the
33:53
cost of acquiring a customer is a very big expense for any company all the
34:00
teams work together to convert leads into paying customer product teams
34:05
strive to deliver a roadmap that excites prospects when they compare it against
34:11
Alternatives number three is customer satisfaction does your product gets the
34:17
job done or is it more than that your customers need to feel that the product is
34:23
irreplaceable so much so that if they leave their company they become
34:29
evangelists for your product in the new organization
34:34
taking both qualitative and quantitative feedback from customers at the regular
34:39
Cadence will help you do that and finally getting prioritization right one
34:45
of the toughest things you will do as a product manager is to decide what not to build
34:52
but to build now and what will later this means you'll be saying no as a
34:59
product manager a lot you can check out our video that helps you do this with a lot of finesse it's
Product Management Roles and Responsibilities
35:05
only when you build what's right for the users when you succeed let's look at the rules and responsibilities of each pm to
35:15
understand how they achieve these goals product managers juggle a lot of different responsibilities each day a
35:21
PM's role that stage over time from an individual contributor to a people
35:27
manager eventually you will join your leadership team and lead the product
35:32
vision and strategy let's start at the very first step the associate product
35:38
manager or the APM this is an entry level opportunity for anyone looking to
35:45
start fresh you start with handling small bugs and updates before graduating
35:51
on to take full releases as an APM a good way to start out is by shadowing an
35:59
experienced product manager for a few months it enables you to learn on the
36:04
job while having the support of someone who has been in the trenches for some time you start learning both strategic
36:12
and tactical parts of the job like running stand-ups grooming meetings
36:18
product demos customer interviews doing design sessions and prioritizing product
36:24
features you learn a lot and will have a lot of questions make sure you speak up
36:30
and ask them don't be shy there are no wrong questions in the business you will
36:37
bring a fresh perspective use that to make an impact on the product roadmap
36:42
the next is the product manager or the PM you will need a couple of years under
36:49
your belt in product related roles to become a product manager
36:54
the associate product manager roles generally are not as widespread especially in smaller companies you're
37:01
part of becoming a product manager might start as a business analyst or QA or a
37:06
sales engineer any role where you develop a deep understanding of
37:12
customers is a great stepping stone for transitioning into this role in this
37:17
role you will collaborate with cross-function stakeholders to deliver the roadmap the roadmap can be the
37:23
Complete product it could be part of a larger product or a new product that you're working on
37:28
in larger company it is very common to have more than one product manager responsible for the same product for
37:35
example if you have a mobile app there might be a separate PM for the home page
37:40
one for the search results page on the one for the ads on the app similar to a
37:46
product manager you also have product owners a lot of times uh PMs and POS
37:52
they use interchangeably if you work for a small company chances are that you
37:58
might end up doing both the roles the primary role of a PO is to manage the
38:03
downstream work of product management the PO is someone who has strong Technical and project management skills
38:11
some of the things that you end up focusing on breaking down user stories into tasks that the development team
38:16
needs to work on identify blockers for product releases and work to remove them
38:21
work with the dev manager to track the velocity of product releases and track
38:27
and review the progress of product development with the engineering manager next up is the senior product manager
38:35
until this stage product managers are individual contributors
38:40
key focus is the product in a Serial PM row they start taking up
38:47
responsibilities that prepare them to become great people managers as well they start mentoring product managers
38:54
and in some cases even managing apms this helps them understand the new set
39:00
of challenges that come with managing people next up is director of product management CV the product organization
39:07
in this role your focus shifts away from daily activities of product releases to
39:12
more strategic things like driving the productivision managing the product team
39:18
one-on-ones performance evaluations Etc and then being the voice of the
39:24
product in the leadership team and finally the chief product officer
39:31
large companies cpos lead the product management product operations and design
39:38
teams they work with the CEO to define the growth roadmap for the company their
39:43
responsibilities in this role will vary from organization to organizations we
39:49
won't Dev too deep into the cpo's role in our course in the last section we
Product Management Stakeholders
39:54
talked about your team now it's time to introduce you to everyone you'll be working with
40:00
and that's a lot of people probably the entire company so be patient while we
40:05
introduce you to all your amazing co-workers it's also one of the most interesting
40:11
aspects of working in product management you start out as an individual contributor but the amount of
40:18
cross-functional collaboration that is needed for you to be successful is a lot you act as a bridge between various
40:25
parts of the organization this aspect of your work is exciting and challenging at
40:32
the same time different teams have their areas of focus you need to put
40:39
this jigsaw of expectations together in a way that all stakeholders are in
40:45
agreement with the direction of the product and that's not easy so let's introduce you to some of them
40:51
outside the organizations you have primarily your customers and Prospects
40:57
customers we already talked about them a little bit before the people who use
41:02
your product and help you pay the bills so they're really important for you to work with
41:08
prospects are people who are evaluating your product to see if it's a good fit for their organization
41:14
besides these external stakeholders there's a lot of internal stakeholders that will be working with let's look at
41:21
the different teams and the stakeholders within them let's start with the engineering team
41:27
and the engineering team you'll have engineering managements product managers work with engineering managers to
41:33
discuss a lot of things like you know to discuss on a regular Cadence the status
41:39
of work in progress to make sure that product releases go out on time
41:44
they work with them to look at potential ideas that are being considered for development and also to balance customer
41:51
Focus Features with technical debt that needs resources
41:57
Architects are are people who help product managers make the right tactical decisions who
42:04
work with them on things like investigating technical feasibility of product ideas in early stages
42:12
or you know if you're trying to decide the implementation of product features or sometimes if you're evaluating
42:19
third-party providers that the product team is looking to partner with
42:25
next up is Developers product managers who work with
42:30
developers to discuss any roadblocks that they might be facing during development or to answer questions that might arise
42:37
on how certain product features should work so developers work very closely
42:43
with QA so does product managers quality assurance Engineers they're like The Gatekeepers
42:49
who make sure that the product adhes the quality standards set by the team they're actually the first users of the
42:55
product or feature and getting and they're a great sounding board for new features as a product manager you should
43:03
do regular walkthroughs of your product with them it will help you in finding
43:09
and identifying missed use cases that should have been part of the origin
43:15
requirements you also have scrum Masters the lead initiative of helping the
43:21
company building agile mindset which is very important in work with them to find ways to improve the development process
43:28
and reduce the number of roadblocks for the engineering team there are a lot more stakeholders in the engineering
43:35
team but I think for now uh getting to know all these people is is a great
43:40
start now the question comes up like what is the best way for a product manager to
43:46
work with the engineering team I believe it is our job as product managers to make sure the development
43:52
team has insight into why things are being done a certain way
43:58
for example you might need to stop working on one feature and jump on
44:03
something else so in that scenario make sure that the business context behind such
44:11
changes is is communicated to the engineering team another great example is bugs not all
44:19
bugs are worth fixing uh a lot of people have very different opinions about it
44:25
so come up with a bug crash process with the engineering team that makes it clear on what we need to fix and what not and
44:33
most importantly consult consult the development team during all the stages of the product development cycle a great
44:40
working relationship with your engineering team will go a long way in
44:45
achieving your product goals next up is the design team The Design Team Works to
44:50
build a user experience that is intuitive and easy to use you'll work
44:56
with different members of the steam to solve usability issues in the product
45:02
in some smaller companies designers and product managers might actually be part
45:07
of the same team design team often consists of ux
45:13
researchers and product designers now ux researchers spend a majority of
45:20
their time talking to users to understand their needs wants drivers and
45:26
goals the research actually forms the foundation of the design principles that
45:33
is that drives the design philosophy of your company it helps the company make the right
45:39
design decisions in order to do this to do all their research they use a lot of different
45:46
methods like conducting user interviews or focus groups
45:51
or driving a b testings or conducting car sorting exercises or
45:58
doing a lot of surveys some methods might be more effective with users than
46:04
others for drug designers on the other hand create user interfaces that are based on
46:10
the findings of the ux researcher using it they build customer-centric designs that enable users to easily
46:18
solve their problems using the product you work with them to take the idea
46:23
through the different stages of the product life cycle so how can you work well with your design counterparts the
46:31
thing is that what users say and what they do is always different product
46:37
managers and their counterparts have to work together to build a robust
46:43
understanding of users for example you might run focus group or build service
46:48
together to better understand the user's mindset from a designer's perspective it can be frustrating when design is bound
46:56
by technical limitation as a product manager you have to make efforts to provide designers a canvas that allows
47:03
them to express their creativity next up is the CLC this is the structure of the
47:09
sale seeing might actually vary depending on the kind of sales strategy that the company has so you can see
47:14
yourself working with you know somebody like a direct sales rep or an inbound sales rep their work is to convert leads
47:21
that come through the marketing team into paying customers or you might work with Channel sales or Enterprise sales
47:28
rep who work uh with implementation Partners on inter Enterprise sales opportunities
47:35
or sales engineers especially in teams that sell technical
47:40
products sales Engineers work a lot with potential customers they demo the
47:46
product to them build up the use cases of how customer problems can actually be
47:52
solved by the product sales team is your window into what prospects are looking for you need to document all the
47:59
feedback from prospects and analyze it to find gaps in your offering working
48:05
towards meeting quotas and monthly targets can actually be very challenging
48:11
at some point in your career you might not be able to fulfill a sales request
48:16
that they need to close a deal and these conversations can be tough
48:22
knowing how to tackle them as a product manager is very very important then you
48:28
have a marketing team the marketing team focuses on messaging customer communication and lead generation we run
48:35
marketing programs could be email campaigns or social events to drive
48:41
awareness about the product similar to sales you might see uh different kinds
48:47
of setup you might work with an email marketing manager their focus is to improve email
48:53
conversions they work to improve metrics like open rate click-through rate or
48:59
click rate on emails and work with a variety of or marketing automation softwares all you might work
49:06
with the digital marketing managers who optimize the digital channels like Facebook Instagram
49:12
or LinkedIn to drive your growth they've worked to increase organic and paid traffic on the
49:19
company's side to generate leads as a product manager you collaborate with the marketing team on defining value
49:27
proposition of the product educating the theme on product features translating
49:33
product features into marketable content building collateral in the form of
49:38
Articles product demos that help Drive traffic or researching and analyzing
49:45
competitors communication strategy wow that's a lot of stakeholders hold your
49:51
horses there are two more teams that you need to talk about you have the customer success team it consists of a number of
49:57
customer success Associates and a manager it actually leaves the charge on
50:03
onboarding new customers that have bought the product in retaining existing customers
50:09
and evangelizing the various functionalities of the product the
50:14
customer's success team is a treasured Trove of information and as a product manager
50:20
you can learn a lot from them for example how many customers actually use
50:26
your features what are the different workarounds in the product that are popular and can actually extend the
50:32
problems that the products solve all this information your customers success
50:38
team can provide you all right the last one the support team this team is the one that deals with
50:46
unhappy customers and are always in the line of fire so please be nice to them
50:53
to manage the craziness that they deal with they often divide support into
50:58
different levels the structure of the support team might look something like this you will have your L1 support
51:05
when a customer calls in uh for help this is the group that will answer
51:10
they'll try to troubleshoot it and solve the issue on the call based on some documentation they might have if they
51:17
can't they will send over the case to an L2 with detailed nodes
51:23
now the L2 support team generally has some sort of a technical background experience with working on the product
51:29
and they can actually Deep dive into a problem and see if they can solve it
51:35
if the LT L2 team is not able to solve it moves over to L3
51:42
which is basically somebody from the development team stepping up to find the
51:49
root cause of the problem and solving it you will work with the support teams to
51:55
find the priority and the severity of issues basically how sensitive the issue is uh in terms of time and how
52:03
difficult it is to fix it gaps in communication of product features can
52:09
often confuse users and they often turn up as support calls and need to be fixed
52:15
by product managers now that you know about your team your customers and co-workers let's take
A Day in The Life Of A Product Manager
52:23
a look at how all of that translate into how you go about your day each day you
52:29
come to work what happens when you walk into your office building or open up your laptop in your pajamas
52:39
work from home to be honest it is very difficult to print down
52:45
an account of what product managers do in a typical day because it varies so
52:51
much just like all of the rules every day you get hit by something new but in
52:56
the midst of all this there are a few things that do remain consistent things
53:02
that need to happen every day or most days so we will start with those and
53:09
then look at other stuff that might consume the entirety of the time some
53:14
days but not every day a product manages primary focus is to Define what needs to
53:22
be done and why it needs to be done after defining these they work with the
53:28
engineering team to figure out the Hub to accomplish it they do not own the how but are a key
53:37
stakeholder in it as an individual contributor with focus on cross-function
53:43
collaboration a product manager will be doing both strategic and tactical work a
53:51
day in the life of a product managers could look something like this you get into
53:58
the office by around 8 am we start off by checking your messages
54:04
you respond to emails or slack messages and take notes on things you need to do
54:09
over the course of the day your first meeting of the day would used to be the dev stand up around 9 30.
54:17
so you attend the dev stand up and usually the troll of the PM is limited
54:22
to two things one is to answer quick questions on tickets and development that might come up or parking lot the
54:29
ticket for a larger discussion later second is to provide Clarity on competing priorities or for example some
54:35
support tickets might have customers waiting on them and support the product manager to decide whether someone should
54:42
take them up or continue working on the stuff that has been assigned to them
54:47
sometimes you might have to attend more than one stand up if you work on multiple product releases that different
54:54
teams are managing will go into details of daily standards later on in the course when we discuss
55:01
the different types of meanings usually right after the dev stand up comes the
55:06
product team meeting it's really a chance to Rally all the product troops the team discusses what's
55:13
on everyone's plague not necessarily to track their work but to find out where people are stuck
55:20
and where people need help usually you also bring in tough and tricky questions
55:25
that might have come the death stand up to this meeting remember you don't have
55:30
to solve everything all by yourself it's also a quick check-in to see if everyone
55:35
is on the same page and priorities for the products haven't changed overnight
55:42
you might laugh at me for saying something so silly but it actually
55:48
happens more often that you like part of being a product manager is
55:55
being able to switch Gates quickly because pride is in business can indeed
56:00
change overnight consider the impact that the product team has it is one of the smallest team you will find in most
56:09
tech companies to be completely honest it can sometimes get a bit lonely I've
56:15
been on teams where I was the only product manager yes so the team was
56:21
basically me and my boss all the more reason for product managers to engage with the cross-sectional peers and build
56:28
relationships after you've done with these two important meetings what's next more meetings it's probably around 11
56:35
A.M now and during the day and to be honest uh product managers are notorious to be in meetings all they are at some
56:42
of my counterparts shocked to see how jam-packed my calendar is sometimes with meetings not a good thing it's all I
56:50
always tell them uh I haven't heard the product manager is the CEO of the product
56:56
that's the CEO part man all these meetings so just kidding uh but you do
57:02
spend a great part of your time in meetings thankfully you don't have to do all the meetings on the same day so
57:10
starting around 11 you might be on customer calls
57:16
you might be doing product prioritization meetings user story mapping meetings product planning
57:22
meetings backlog meetings sales Shadow calls support escalation
57:28
meetings design review meetings requirements Gathering meetings print planning meetings end of spin demo
57:35
meetings the list goes on and on so by the time you're done with a lot of
57:41
meetings we've discuss above and you have had your lunch somewhere
57:46
around three o'clock and now is the time where you can roll up your sleeve and do some focused work
57:52
that enables you to get product Vision a bit closer to reality let's look at some
57:58
of the work that you do on the second half of your day conducting market research it is
58:04
important to have a pulse on the market and stay in sync the latest trends in the industry market research includes
58:11
looking at new products in the market or or the competition has been up to
58:17
this is accomplished by looking at SCC filings for public companies messaging
58:23
on companies websites attending webinars hosted by them looking at release notes
58:30
for product updates for competitors analyzing industry reports generated by research firms market research is not
58:38
limited to just direct competition product managers are always on the lookout for science from across
58:45
technology landscape that impact the way the customers perceive their products or
58:51
Solutions next is writing one pages of business cases not all features are
58:57
equal they vary on the time it takes to build them and impact on the business you will develop one Pages for a lot of
59:06
free product features under consideration it basically describes the problem faced by users proposed solution
59:14
impact on the customer base and value for the next up is writing requirements breaking
59:22
down uses stories into improvements that the development team works on is a big
59:27
part of product management many product managers spend a lot of time writing
59:32
requirements uh user stories to Define features that solve use of problems depending on the size of the feature is
59:39
common to break it down into epics and user stories which can be further broken down into tasks and subtasks by the
59:45
engineering team you will also be doing uh wireframes during the initial stages
59:51
when Solutions are being considered it is useful to come up with low fidelity
59:56
mockups this can be as simple as a rough search on a piece of paper it really helps the
1:00:03
team understand and contribute to the development of the final solution for
1:00:08
users it also helps in having fruitful discussions with the design team I have
1:00:14
used balsamic and envision uh which are fairly easy to use and can help you
1:00:21
build wireframes fairly quickly for your different iterations uh you really don't have to create
1:00:27
detailed mock-up in initial stages of your ideation process conducting
1:00:33
grooming sessions this meeting serves many purposes for new features is is
1:00:39
like a handoff or passing the pattern to the development team the goal is to go
1:00:44
through the requirements of the development team so that everybody understands the acceptance criteria for
1:00:50
each story and finally analyzing data following data is important not only for
1:00:56
product managers but everyone in the organization are data driven culture
1:01:01
drives Innovation and is critical to the success of any product but the truth is that you never have enough data to make
1:01:08
your decisions in smaller organization we don't have a dedicated data analytics team
1:01:16
to support you it can be challenging to find all data points product managers should always try to back the tuition
1:01:23
with as much relevant data as possible in cases where you can't find the data
1:01:30
make sure that you state your assumptions so that you can come back later and validate them
1:01:36
I talk long and hard as to what would be the best way to make you familiar with different
1:01:42
parts of product management and then I asked myself what makes product managers
1:01:47
happy Building Products right that is why most of us get into the business or want to
1:01:54
so what if we give you a blank canvas tomorrow to build something from scratch
1:02:00
how would you go about taking it on taking on what is an idea in your head
1:02:06
into a fully fleshed out product how can you take a productive approach
1:02:13
for this so that's what we'll do we've taken idea through its entire life cycle
1:02:19
the two ways we could have done this we could have come up with the problem and the product solution we want to build
1:02:25
and introduce the concepts as we build out the product and that's how we
1:02:31
started to build our course but after first few lessons things started to get really complicated
1:02:37
really fast partly because you're talking about too many different things at the same time
1:02:43
and jumping off topics every minute that was making things super confusing
1:02:49
so we decided to take a step back since the primary audience for this course are
1:02:55
people who need to product management they decided to divide the rest of the course into two key Parts first you want
1:03:03
to introduce you to all things product management because list is long and by all things
1:03:09
we mean Concepts terminology Frameworks and everything else you will likely be
1:03:16
facing as a product manager we encourage you to go over this section A few times before moving on to the
1:03:23
second section if the second section we will focus on applying what we have learned in a real world scenario we
1:03:30
won't build anything complicated that is not the goal we build a simple product which will most likely hit the same
1:03:37
existential scenarios than any other product will I hope you're excited let's get started
Product Vision
1:03:46
vision is the ability to think about or plan the future with the imagination or
1:03:53
wisdom now Vision doesn't need to be tackling something Earth shattering
1:03:59
your vision can be driven by your experiences your learnings your mistakes
1:04:05
can you start building a product without a vision in my opinion you can
1:04:12
a lot of people might disagree with me but the reality of it is that not everything is Crystal Clear from the
1:04:19
beginning people often start building out their product because they really really want
1:04:25
to solve this one problem and then when they start getting into it they find more reasons to continue down
1:04:33
that path they find that Clarity of thought you must have heard people often talk
1:04:39
about the need to look at the big picture but sometimes the big picture only
1:04:46
starts to emerge one problem at a time as you begin to understand your users
1:04:52
and their problems I'm in no way trying to Discount the importance of product Vision what I'm
1:04:59
trying to get to at is that your vision will evolve over time and you will have
1:05:06
more clarity down the road than when you're starting out vision is what drives you to work on the
1:05:14
problem what excites you to make progress in this area and what all teams
1:05:19
Beyond just product management can share and relate to is that unifying force The Guiding Light
1:05:26
that keeps you on the right track whenever you're at Crossroads and have to make a choice between a lot of
1:05:33
options to be completely honest I know a lot of product managers
1:05:38
who are not big fans of grandiose Visions some of them don't like the
1:05:44
abstractness of the visuals they see floating around and on some levels I do agree
1:05:50
but not enough for us to ignore this in our course it is important here to know
1:05:56
that when you start off as a product manager your task most likely will not be to come up with a vision for your
1:06:02
company the founders the executive team and others might have already worked on
1:06:08
it and done a number of product visioning exercises the importance of product vision for product managers
1:06:15
whose previously starting out is that it enables them to stay on course
1:06:20
in this course will not teach you how to build a product visually
1:06:26
Because by the time you are at a place you're Building Product visuals should have had enough experience
1:06:32
to be able to do it yourself without needing Our advice what we will do though is to make you
1:06:39
understand how Vision helps product managers it will help you in two ways it
1:06:46
will help you understand a prospective employer better when looking for a product management role once you've
1:06:53
joined a company you will be able to make better decisions if you understand what the vision means
1:06:59
and how to use it as The Guiding Light when making product decisions if you're
1:07:05
a small organization with just one product your company Vision will most likely become your product Vision but if
1:07:11
you're a large cooperation like Amazon is likely that each product org has its
1:07:16
own product Vision which more closely represents what the product wants and
1:07:21
aspires to achieve for its Target losers for the purpose of a discussion we won't
1:07:27
stress about product versus company vision and look at the general qualities
1:07:32
of a good Vision vision statement a good Vision needs to have a brain
1:07:39
it took us a whole week to come up with a school acronym I hope you guys like it my brain we really mean is it needs to
1:07:47
be bold a bold vision statements that's the culture for the company it encourages a growth mindset it needs to
1:07:54
be relatable when people read the vision statement they should be able to relate to it these people are your employees
1:08:01
your customers your stakeholders the vision needs to be ambitious you
1:08:06
should aspire to make a big impact talked about earlier that it's okay to
1:08:12
start small but eventually you want to be able to make a big impact
1:08:18
the vision needs to be inspiring reading the vision should instill a sense of
1:08:23
purpose and inspire people to work towards it and it becomes really important when once you're not a small
1:08:31
startup and you become a really large company the vision should be able to inspire the team and get them excited to
1:08:37
come to work and most importantly a vision needs to be navigable there should be a part to
1:08:43
get to that Vision that path without a doubt will be filled with lots of challenges and roadblocks but it's okay
1:08:50
as long as you believe that you can navigate through them but you can't start with just the vision
Product Goals
1:08:57
you need to put more definition to things in order to make progress so look
1:09:03
let's look at the other things in this Vision hierarchy that will help you
1:09:08
below the vision are goals goals are a little bit less abstract than visions
1:09:16
they are all things that you need to achieve that will get you closer to
1:09:21
realizing your vision goals are measurable and all the efforts you make roll up to help you achieve
1:09:29
your product goals we'll have broken down further for them to be more actionable enough for the
1:09:35
entire company you also have to ask yourself what path you want to take in
1:09:41
order to achieve your goals because there can be many and that is what brings us to what people call product
Product Strategy
1:09:48
strategy product strategy lays down your plan to achieve your goal like you said
1:09:54
there are many ways in which you can go about achieving it to all these different path you can take to get to
1:10:00
the same destination but which is the best path for you the strategy lays down that path
1:10:08
in order to build the right strategy you'll have to be able to take your product through the minimum viable
1:10:16
product cycle until you find that product Market fit don't worry we'll get
1:10:21
to all of this shortly in the initial days of your product you will need to experiment to find the right product
1:10:27
strategy a good product strategy outlines who will use your product AKA your
1:10:35
target users the needs their wants their drivers
1:10:41
what you need to focus on that is the problem you're trying to solve
1:10:46
why you need to focus on this versus everything else out there
1:10:52
how will you go about building it will you actually build it buy it or
1:10:57
partner for it and when will you actually do it AKA your product
1:11:04
roadmap you dial in your vision your goals you know what the strategy
1:11:10
you're going to have so far so good now it's time to get crackling you know what what will you
Product Initiatives
1:11:18
do to make all of that happen What are some of the big ticket items that align
1:11:23
with your product strategy which will help you achieve your goal these initiatives form your product
1:11:30
roadmap now initiatives might span across many releases and sales quarters
1:11:36
they've broken down into manageable updates that the team can get out with
1:11:41
an acceptable time frames initiatives are driven by goals but at the Crux of
1:11:48
it all it is driven by the fundamental problems that your product wants to solve
Product Features
1:11:55
initiatives are further broken down into features a common mistake that is often
1:12:00
made is that companies often jump right into features without flushing out all
1:12:06
this stuff we've talked about above and they get into this thing called a feature trap because it's easy to look
1:12:14
at all the great features you can build versus asking the hard questions on what
1:12:19
the problems are and how you can actually solve them features are often broken down and into epics which are
Epics | User Stories| Tasks
1:12:27
groupings of work that fits together and needs to be done one of the most important things that you'll be working
1:12:33
on as a product manager is building user stories epics are further broken down
1:12:39
into user stories which defines an interaction that a user has with the
1:12:44
product and it can be independently tested on its own
1:12:50
user stories are often broken down into tasks over the years I've heard
1:12:55
different definitions of what a task is for me tasks are a set of things that the development team needs to do in
1:13:01
order to complete a feature honestly there are a lot of different ways you can slice and dice and break down what
1:13:07
you want to do you can have as many or as less levels as you'd like
1:13:13
you'll spend a lot more time talking about Apex user stories and tasks later
1:13:19
on since as a product manager they will become your best friends I think they're at the point of time in our course where
Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
1:13:26
we can actually start talking about MVP that we keep referencing all the time
1:13:33
you know what building building something new something you believe in is exhilarating it's a feeling of Rush
1:13:41
like no other but building something only for that feeling is is not
1:13:47
something that a lot of us can afford like I said before that they'll always be more you want to do than the
1:13:55
resources you have MVP is prioritizing what you need to build to test if it's
1:14:01
worth investing in the concept of MVP was developed by Eric Reids according to
1:14:08
him a minimum viable product is that version of a new product which
1:14:15
allows the team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about the
1:14:21
customer with the least effort MVP can need different things in different
1:14:27
organizations in layman's term MVP is building the most basic version of a
1:14:33
product with only the code functionality and without all the bells and whistles
1:14:39
sometimes what is called an MVP is not really an MVP it's really a POC or a
1:14:46
prototype or in MMP what's after all these acronyms well now
1:14:54
that we know what an MVP means let's look at a lot of things that it is not but often confused with POC which stands
1:15:01
for proof for concept the goal of a POC is to find out if it's possible to build
1:15:09
out the idea into an actual product with the technology available
1:15:14
POC is helpful if you are innovating and trying out to do something that has not
1:15:20
been done before so POC doesn't even need to have a UI as long as you improve the technical feasibility using your
1:15:27
death cards obviously now then you have the Prototype a prototype
1:15:32
tells you how the user will interact with the product it defines the flow of
1:15:38
various elements and how the users will use them to solve their problem and
1:15:44
finally we have the MMP the minimum marketable product it is the smallest
1:15:51
version of the product that the users will buy it is the stripped down no
1:15:57
frills stable version of the product that has enough value in it to be sold
1:16:03
NSS you can look at all of these as different stages in the evolution of an
1:16:09
MVP depending on your product you might skip one stage or another so how do you not
1:16:17
get confused and you know that you're actually building an MVP and not a POC
1:16:23
or prototype or MMP it develops something called the MEP
1:16:29
test which is a really small set of questions that you ask yourself so for example you have an idea you want to
1:16:37
validate in the market and you've decided to take the MVP route sounds like you're on the right track
1:16:42
you create specs of what you think is the bare minimum but how can we show
1:16:49
that is in fact an MVP and not everything else a good way to do that is for you and
1:16:57
your team to ask the following questions when looking at the proposed product
1:17:03
number one does it solve the problem which is its focus number two can you
1:17:10
cut down the scope further without impacting one and number three have you
1:17:16
cut down the scope so much that the product now is pay phones but doesn't really solve the problem
1:17:22
the intention behind this question is to find the right balance between the three
1:17:27
variables that make up an MVP they are number one resource you don't want to
1:17:34
invest too much on the product at this stage number two time delivering quickly
1:17:41
enables you to iterate faster and finally value the key value that the
1:17:47
product has to offer needs to come through so is the goal to get everything
Build Measure Learn (BML)
1:17:52
right with their first MVP absolutely not the primary goal of namelyp is to help
1:17:59
you learn whether the idea appeals to users the first version of the product
1:18:04
that uses by the most likely not be the first
1:18:09
version of the MVP effect and MVP doesn't need to end with just one release it follows a cycle driven by
1:18:16
real world data based on how customers behave with the MVP let's look at the
1:18:23
three steps that the MVP follows also known as the build measure learn
1:18:28
cycle you build the most basic version of the product you think will work now
1:18:36
you think here is your hypothesis your cut based on the research you've done or
1:18:43
the experiences you've had make sure that you add relevant tracking to your product so that you can
1:18:49
proactively track your metrics instead of it being an afterthought
1:18:56
measured be clear about what do you want to measure why do you want to measure it
1:19:04
how will you measure it can not stress enough on the part that how should be
1:19:11
part of the build phase it shouldn't be in a situation that your mdpp has been
1:19:16
out for a month before you decide to track important metrics besides quantitative measurements you might also
1:19:24
be able to gauge the performance of your mp3 through qualitative feedback from
1:19:30
customer interviews feedback forums focus groups or analyzing recordings of user
1:19:37
interaction with your product learn your MVP has been out for a few weeks
1:19:43
you've got the data I've been speaking to users now how do you decipher the
1:19:48
results see if you're able to answer the following questions by looking at your
1:19:54
data who is using your product how often are they using the product
1:20:02
how many users are coming into reference what does the feedback suggest create
1:20:09
the MVP miss anything that is important to the users based on the answers to the
1:20:15
above questions you will know the next steps there are many different possibilities like users don't think
1:20:23
this problem is worth solving or users don't understand how your
1:20:28
product works or users have different expectations from what they get when they come and
1:20:34
how the product versus what they thought or not enough people are using the
1:20:40
product or you need to build some additional capabilities and fix but you
1:20:45
can test the MVP again apply what you've learned to build the next version of your mdp until you've reach the final
1:20:52
conclusion the number of advantages to using the
1:20:58
mdp framework and MVP will help you test your hypothesis in an efficient manner
1:21:03
it forces you to take your long-term vision of what your product needs to do
1:21:09
and filter it down to its core capabilities which is which is at the
1:21:15
center of its existence through your MVP you will be able to save Resources by
1:21:21
building only what's necessary will be able to move fast and fail fast
1:21:26
and be able to reduce the time to Market and get real-world data on usual
1:21:32
behaviors however there are some challenges with MVPs
1:21:39
MVPs are tough to get right and what's even tougher is to sum up what you learn
1:21:45
from the MVP because sometimes the MVP will tell you that your idea is not
1:21:52
worth investing in and that can be a tough thing to hear even for a battle
1:21:58
hardened product management official let's list down two of the biggest
1:22:05
challenges you will find while building an MVP number one cutting features scope
1:22:12
to get out the minimum this can happen when you're staring at the possibility of missing the deadline
1:22:18
to release your MVP or the development team is stretched
1:22:24
with other competing priorities or you have a shoe string budget to
1:22:30
build your MVP number two forgetting that MVPs aren't
1:22:37
as polished as well established products at the in the beginning we all look at
1:22:43
the MVP definition and we collectively give a thumbs up and not in agreement but when it really comes down to giving
1:22:49
the go ahead to release we forget that it's not the final product is just a
1:22:57
test we start nitpicking on how it looks and feature sets we have and it's
1:23:03
difficult to move past beyond that sometimes so how do you go about building your MVP there are actually
5 Steps to Building MVP
1:23:10
five steps that you need to go through in order to build and test out your MVP step number one is to develop your
1:23:17
hypothesis the fact of the matter is that you might have figured it all out in your head or what products you're
1:23:24
going to build the problem you're going to solve and every minute detail but it's important to sit down and write
1:23:32
your hypothesis for the benefit of everyone the hypothesis would look something like if we provide users X
1:23:40
then y will happen take the time out to define the X do
1:23:46
your market research and talk to your customer facing teams to see if the hypothesis seems plausible
1:23:53
look at any historical data in your company or outside that can help you come up with a realistic why
1:24:01
step two is to identify your target users the long-term vision for your
1:24:07
product might be for a number of different types of users but for an MVP it is important to
1:24:14
focus on the innovators or the early adopters
1:24:20
these are people who are more likely to be open to try out new things and pave
1:24:25
the way for others to try it out in the future ideally you should build out customer personas and keep them updated
1:24:32
throughout throughout the life cycle of your product we will talk more about customer
1:24:38
personas in the next section step three is to gauge the market opportunity does
1:24:44
the market align with your business goals look at what exists in the market today are there Alternatives substitutes
1:24:52
in the market that solve the same problem if yes then do a deep dive into what they offer and how would your
1:24:59
product differentiate from the competition step four is to evaluate the
1:25:05
technical feasibility during the MVP stage an important thing to consider is
1:25:10
whether you really need to completely build out the product from ground up I should focus your resources on the key
1:25:18
differentiator for your product for example if your MVP requires you to send notifications to users then should you
1:25:25
build that capability from scratch no absolutely not unless it's your key
1:25:32
differentiator use a third party for it who knows how to do it and it's their
1:25:38
key differentiator and step number five iterate using the build measure learn
1:25:43
framework to develop the MVP that gives you the user validation that you're
1:25:49
looking for let's talk about customer personas for a
Personas in Product Management
1:25:54
bit this is an important aspect for both product and marketing teams in most
1:26:00
cases both teams will build their own personas you can have two categories of personas
1:26:06
actually even more depending on how you decide to grow different people who
1:26:13
interact with your product but for now we will focus on the two common groupings a personas that we usually see
1:26:20
the first is the user Persona these are people who use your product
1:26:26
and by using I mean they actually use it day in and day out they use your product
1:26:33
to solve the problems being faced by their company when you release an update you'll be reaching out to these people
1:26:39
for feedback during the buying stage they play an important role in evaluating whether your product meets
1:26:46
all the needs of their business the second grouping of personas is buyer
1:26:52
persona these are people who represent key stakeholders in the buying process they
1:26:57
might be users or not especially in larger B2B Enterprise deals
1:27:03
the goals and motivations and needs and wants will greatly vary from that of
1:27:09
user personas they're looking for the right product at the right price point their work ends
1:27:16
when the company signs on the dotted line your sales team will spend a lot of
1:27:21
time talking to the buyer Persona so how does one go about building these Persona
1:27:27
do you start with the Clean Slate or something else the process I have been following is
1:27:34
fairly straightforward while doing all the research on the Product Industry and competition
1:27:40
I built a persona I think will work then I modify it by talking to customers on a
1:27:47
regular basis we will look at how to conduct a customer interview in the next section
1:27:53
but make it your Habit to schedule customer interviews on a regular basis
1:27:58
try talking to customers each week the more you talk to customers the
1:28:04
better your product will turn out to be so the question that still hasn't been
1:28:10
answered is why we need to build the personas and how are we going to use
1:28:16
them are we building them because our boss told us to
1:28:22
or because we have lots of free time uh no no no no not not none of these to
1:28:29
be honest personas help us in a variety of fields number one they help us in
1:28:36
building a better useful experience when you talk to users over and over again and build out their personas you're able
1:28:44
to empathize with them because you begin to truly understand and appreciate all
1:28:50
the problems and challenges they face and all the things they do to overcome them that empathy helps you make design
1:28:58
decisions which help you build a seamless user experience that caters to
1:29:03
your audience personas help you also build a better communication strategy if
1:29:09
you know what drives and inspires your users you can build your communication around that your comms will then help
1:29:16
gain the attention and appreciation of these users and finally product requirements you will always build
1:29:24
better products when you know who you're building it for I've worked on a product
1:29:30
which had almost eight user personas now with a lot of personas it's easy to get
1:29:37
confused as to who will be using the updates so creating user Persona
1:29:42
profiles and making it available to the entire team makes the entire process so
1:29:48
much more efficient let's look at one of the templates for personas a Persona
1:29:54
profile can consist of the following name of the user something that relates
1:30:01
to what they do like gym sales guy a photo doesn't need to be real photos
1:30:06
just something to put a face to the name kind of thing they rule what do they do in the company
1:30:13
do they work in sales marketing or some other team
1:30:18
of work they do is it more tactical strategic are the individual
1:30:23
contributors or people managers their background their skills to they have
1:30:29
technical or non-technical background the size of the company this represents
1:30:35
the segment within your industry where you focus on their goals
1:30:41
the long-term goals aspirations and where they want to get to
1:30:47
their wants what do they like some free time maybe I would love some
1:30:54
free time what inspires them what keeps them motivated to come to
1:31:00
work every day the needs where do they need help places where you
1:31:08
are product could potentially make a difference for that and finally a memorable quote from them
1:31:17
when you interview hundreds of users trust me you will end up hearing
1:31:23
something one day that truly encapsulates the essence of your user
1:31:29
personas use that code in your profile and until that day make something up
1:31:37
a common mistake that a lot of teams make is that they create a Persona in
1:31:43
the beginning of the product's life cycle and then they just stop after this
1:31:48
it's completely forgotten only being resurrected with cosmetic updates for some presentations
1:31:55
this really harms the product in fact the entire company we've spoken at
1:32:00
length about the different stages of the life cycle of a product what actually happens is that the user
1:32:07
Persona at each stage changes as a product invo evolves so being in sync
1:32:15
with those new ones and new needs and new drivers goes a long way in building
1:32:20
the right user experience so please don't be that Keen keep your
1:32:26
user personas updated and ask current I say backlog here I'm assuming that you're on the top
1:32:33
of your product backlog now let's take a look at how you can set
How to Conduct User Interview
1:32:40
up your interactions with customers or users for Success from the get-go you'll meet all kinds of people your
1:32:48
goal when you interact with each of them might be different so structure your interview well here is a one great way
1:32:56
of structuring your interview you start with housekeeping these are things that
1:33:02
you need to just get out of the way some of them are thanking your customers for the time and
1:33:09
how much the team appreciates it very often we forget to do that asking the permission to record the
1:33:16
interview notes are important but it's better to have the ability to go back to
1:33:21
the conversation and revisit it in case you missed something also sometimes you get so entangled in
1:33:30
the notes taking that you may not be able to focus on the actual conversation
1:33:35
so if you think multitasking is going to be a problem then might as well focus on
1:33:41
the actual conversation and take down only your inferences rest of it you can add later
1:33:48
make sure to do introduction don't assume that everyone knows everyone else
1:33:54
in the meeting share a short but relevant introduction and ask the
1:34:00
participants to do so as well follow it up with the agenda describe
1:34:06
the overall flow goals and expectations from the meeting so that everybody is in
1:34:11
sync on what is going to happen next comes your softball questions I
1:34:18
like starting customer interviews with a few easy questions that anyone can answer
1:34:23
it helps at the stage for the actual conversation with these small interactions you're
1:34:30
able to gauge how comfortable the participants are and when is the right
1:34:36
time to get to the real stuff once you know that everybody is comfortable enough it's time to get to the key
1:34:43
question this is the whole reason why you set up the interview you want to talk to the customer and get more
1:34:49
information on something now that something could be to better understand a specific problem being
1:34:55
faced by the users a call to discuss how unhappy they are with everything in the
1:35:02
product trust me you will have a lot of these calls once you start working in product
1:35:09
management or you might talk to customers or users to validate some of your assumptions make sure you prepare
1:35:16
specific questions to get key information you're looking for you can ask both open-ended or closed-ended
1:35:22
questions depending on the type of participant one might work better than the other use the Judgment during the
1:35:28
interview to find what works best one thing that I'll always ask you to remember when doing interviews not just
1:35:35
customer or user any interview is to read the room of course you'll have your script ready your small talk
1:35:41
ready the real topics you want to discuss ready which is the point of the entire call you'll do this and more but
1:35:50
if the person on the other side is not in the right frame of mind to just have
1:35:55
a discussion with you it becomes a pointless exercise and a waste of everyone's time so make sure the people
1:36:01
you end up talking to are the right people by this I mean they have they
1:36:06
should have something to say good or bad doesn't matter they should be invested in the product and they should be able
1:36:12
to come in some time to answer questions from the team at the end of the interview do not forget to thank the
1:36:20
participants for their time and insights also make sure to touch base with them
1:36:26
again at a later date if there are any action items that need follow-up make
1:36:32
sure you make clear notes right after the interview because you might forget a lot of the contextual information as
1:36:38
time passes by highlight the key takeaways and action items for your team
Product Market Fit Explained (PMF)
1:36:46
let's get back to a discussion on mvpn for the build on it your mdp will help
1:36:52
you find the product Market fit product Market fit is the Holy Grail
1:36:59
that everybody is in search of so what's it all about what does product Market really mean I
1:37:07
can't really say that it's X number of people use your product and fly out of them buy it increased product Market fit
1:37:14
is not really that black and white it's
1:37:19
but it's also data driven you must be thinking that now I'm just saying contradicting things
1:37:25
you know when your phone doesn't stop ringing and everybody wants to use their product is when you've actually reached
1:37:32
product Market fit but everyone I don't really mean everyone
1:37:38
it is the people you want to use your product well even that is
1:37:44
not accurate sometimes you target your product to a certain group but it ends
1:37:49
up becoming popular with another let's try again when you're unable to keep
1:37:56
Pace from the speed with which customers are onboarding give feedback and wanting more is when you achieve product Market
1:38:04
fit when the market is pulling a product versus you having to push it down
1:38:09
people's throat because when you've reached product Market fit it's that state where the demand outstands the
1:38:15
supply or when you continuously dream catch up you're growing so fast
1:38:21
that you're not able to scale your infrastructure will all of this happens it means my friend that you have
1:38:29
achieved product Market fit it's a great feeling but it's also just
1:38:35
the beginning so why do you need product Market fit
1:38:40
the concept of product Market fit is very popular in Tech circles but the
1:38:46
truth is that businesses have been applying it from the beginning of time
1:38:51
they just didn't have a name for it it's a simple mathematical calculations all
1:38:56
about resources you all have finite resources at a disposal unless you're a billion dollar
1:39:03
company history has shown that even they have their limits
1:39:08
unless you are a may break an outlier whose life's mission is to see their
1:39:14
idea through and it is either that idea or nothing else you need product Market
1:39:20
fit because you don't want to build something that nobody wants to use you
1:39:25
don't want to build something that people won't give up their current solution for we don't want to build a
1:39:31
product that solves a problem that people would rather just live with you don't want to solve a problem that only
1:39:37
a handful of people are facing except sometimes Maybe you don't want to spend time solving the
1:39:45
problem that the market is telling you is it worth solving you don't want to solve a problem that
1:39:52
is already being solved by others really well and people don't want to switch you
1:39:58
will always find examples contrary to what I just said people who have defined odds and build
1:40:05
companies when it didn't seem possible but there are far and few
1:40:10
and was an exception rather than a room so how do you achieve product Market fit
1:40:16
there isn't one two or three things that can help you to achieve product Market fit no magical in this case but there
1:40:24
are things that when people do again and again over time they're able to either
1:40:30
achieve product Market fit or realize that their product isn't right and that is fine too
1:40:35
let's look at the different things that you need to keep in mind when you're trying to find out where your idea
1:40:41
stands number one understanding the problem first and foremost you need to understand the problem actually that
1:40:48
isn't very accurate let's try again first and foremost you need to find whether what you think is a problem is
1:40:56
actually a problem do you think this is a problem because this is something that has been irritating you for a while or
1:41:03
or are you able to find other people who also look at this as a problem having a
1:41:09
grasp on what you are going to solve is the very first step towards building
1:41:14
something that will be successful there can be a few different scenarios here there's a clear problem and nobody has
1:41:21
solved it till now either it's too tough or maybe it's not worth solving for
1:41:26
example space travel it's not an easy problem to solve the problem is being solved right now but
1:41:33
the solution is in that good foreign
1:41:48
statement it should answer two questions what is the problem
1:41:54
and why do you think it should be solved once you've done this you need to define
1:42:00
the value proposition this is why this is why you think people will buy your
1:42:05
product this is what differentiates you from the back your value proposition should be unique your users should be
1:42:13
able to pick it up easily it shouldn't be easy to replicate some examples of value proposition are
1:42:19
your solution has better user experience your solution is faster it's cheaper
1:42:26
the solutions quality is superior right and what you think is your value proposition a clear value proposition is
1:42:33
easier for customers to understand if your target user hears your marketing messages and says oh that makes sense I
1:42:41
get it it means that your value proposition is spot on highly proposition is not a slogan it's
1:42:49
not a catchphrase it's not a tagline you can create lots of them if you're clear about what your value proposition is the
1:42:55
value proposition should be in plain simple English minus all the marketing
1:43:01
jargon or trending keywords next research the market a lot of things we're talking about actually will happen
1:43:08
in parallel it's not like you first come up with a problem statement and then
1:43:13
look at the market must have looked at the market while writing the problem statement the reason
1:43:19
why we have different sections for each of these is so that you so you spend enough time on all of them don't ignore
1:43:26
the section it's funny boring or tough and you just want to start building things there are lots of ways to do
1:43:32
market research and it should not be limited to sitting in front of the laptop and doing stuff even though
1:43:38
Google can answer almost everything some things you can do for your Market pieces
1:43:44
find people who understand the segment you want to focus on talk to them it brings on what problems
1:43:52
you have identified tell them what your idea is take the feedback identify competitors that exist in the
1:43:59
market both direct and indirect try to find people in your network who use these products talk to them and find out
1:44:07
how satisfied they are with the product are there any events that might be helpful featured an industry conferences
1:44:14
where you can find a ton of people who might be interested in your product see how people react to your product
1:44:21
pages check out reviews on forums for comparative products is anybody talking
1:44:27
about the Gap in their current offering that your product can fill
1:44:32
find out what people are searching online and what they find
1:44:38
what does the typical users Journey for a target audience look like how they
1:44:44
discover the solutions to their problem is by searching online or through
1:44:50
recommendations from Friends next you need to identify the customer
1:44:55
find and talk to people you think are going to use your product and find it
1:45:00
useful create the first customer Persona include information on what does the
1:45:06
daily life of the customer look like what motivates them what frustrates them or folks with them what is the one thing
1:45:13
they could use help for learn to empathize with them different qualitative and quantitative methods
1:45:21
exist that can help you collect this information into user surveys you can ask product Market fit questions to
1:45:28
users that can help you get insights when you're building out the product
1:45:34
issues can be multiple choice or open-ended you can collect information like the type of device the browser that
1:45:42
the users use kind of ask they like and the products they use can't dissolve
1:45:47
their issues but also the focus groups set aside some time to get a good mix of users to come
1:45:52
up as a group and discuss how they feel about the product what their expectations were
1:45:58
and how does this compare to this experience so far you can also do custom
1:46:03
interviews we've talked about it before you can also do some walkthroughs with customers of your product see how
1:46:10
they're using different features navigating through the UI and interacting with the various system what
1:46:16
actually matters in the end is the quality and not the quantity of your interactions with the users make the
1:46:23
effort to come up with questions that will help you make decisions be cognizant of everyone's time and
1:46:28
customize your interaction with each of them accordingly so how do you actually test product
1:46:34
Market fit once you've once your product is out there you just sit back and relax
1:46:40
not really this is where the real fun style assessment of product Market fit is important
1:46:46
you now have a chance to see how your users are responding to what you've put
1:46:52
insights from the introductions or lack of it maybe will tell you what the future of the product is there are three
1:46:59
possible outcomes from your MVP people are in love with the product and
1:47:07
wanted me now people like oh what you build but it's
1:47:12
not their favorite tools solve the problem nobody is using the product
1:47:18
it could be a lot of different reasons for each of the other outcome uh to find it you really need to look at
1:47:25
your data here are some pointers now who is using the MVP if the people using the MVP are the people we thought
1:47:33
would use it then you are correct about target audience your messaging resonates
1:47:40
with them as they're making the way to your website but if people who are using your product do not match your target
1:47:47
audience then you have a problem you need to find the root cause of this
1:47:54
is there a mismatch with what your product offers and what the messaging implies
1:48:00
or are you target audience not who you thought they were next how
1:48:06
many people are using your MVP you might have a perfect MVP according
1:48:12
to you but if not enough people are using it you will never be able to check feedback to improve
1:48:18
you'll have to look at the different stages of your funnel to see where the customer is dropping off
1:48:25
are enough people coming to your site to add the product are people landing on your side but
1:48:31
nobody is signing up for the product next think about how people are using
1:48:36
their product you can find creative ways to use products sometimes more in the way it is
1:48:43
intended to be used needs do the customer needs match the
1:48:48
problem you're trying to solve is the feedback telling you something else
1:48:54
are you solving a different problem next are they telling their friends
1:48:59
about it this is one of the most important signals that tells you if you close to reaching product Market fit
1:49:07
If people really like your product they will tell others about it
1:49:12
and finally how active are the users are people interacting with the product or are they just signing up without
1:49:19
spending much time on the product do they find it difficult to understand how to use the product or are they not
1:49:27
sure what to do with the product sometimes you might try everything possible and still fail you really
1:49:34
believe in your idea but it just doesn't take off you're not able to find that product
1:49:40
Market fit all I can say is give it your best shot so your product might not have
1:49:45
a market to fit in right now sometimes time sustained right and the market
1:49:52
isn't ready it's tough to put yourself out there to actually follow the data versus what your heart tells you
1:49:59
take what you've learned and move on to live to fight another day like I said
1:50:04
sometimes time you try let's dive a little bit deeper on
Gathering Product Feedback
1:50:11
product feedback we've touched upon it a few times early in our course the fact of the matter is that you can
1:50:18
come up with the really inspiring vision a great product strategy but if you're not listening to your users none of it
1:50:25
matters feedback is where I would advise you to also start your journey when you join a
1:50:32
new company you shouldn't first look at the company strategy or the roadmap but you should
1:50:39
try and dig right into the feedback and hear what users are saying about the product
1:50:44
so that later when you do look at the strategy and the roadmap you're able to
1:50:49
identify how in sync or out of sync is the team with the users
1:50:56
also if you're new to product management product feedback is a great starting point to roll up your sleeve and start
1:51:04
using the product having a well-rounded system in place so that helps you effectively manage the feedback goes a
1:51:10
long way in building a successful product roadmap that really reflects the
1:51:16
needs of the customer in this section we will look at how you can easily set one
1:51:21
up there are a few key sources where you get your feedback from either you get it from your internal
1:51:27
stakeholders when they use the product for demoing into prospects onboarding
1:51:33
new customers troubleshooting problems that exist say users might be facing or
1:51:39
building your testing out updates that need to be released you can also get feedback from customers who use your
1:51:46
product on their business they need if the needs of their business change they might request the functionality from you
1:51:52
or if something breaks they might log in a bug in your system similarly prospects
1:51:59
who are currently evaluating a product will be able to tell you whether it satisfies all the use cases or not in
1:52:06
order to effectively manage feedback it's important to identify the different types you can come up with as many categories
1:52:14
but the real question is why do you actually need different types of feedback or categories
1:52:20
you want to just be able to manage it to be honest and second by looking at different categories of feedback you'll
1:52:26
be able to get a well-rounded picture of how your product is being perceived by users let's look at some of the common
1:52:33
categories of feedback that you will come across the first one is a new product idea
1:52:39
this is a completely new product or feature that does not exist today a lot
1:52:44
of these come from a sales team in the conversation with prospects they provide you with a view into the evolving
1:52:50
customer needs and the competitive landscape or for your industry when looking at them take note of the
1:52:57
following what is the problem that the user is trying to solve is there a
1:53:02
feature that can solve the problem but isn't obvious enough is there a workaround that can be a
1:53:10
temporary solution or does a company even want to solve this problem the second type of feedback is people asking
1:53:17
for updates or changes to an existing feature uh by making those you'll be
1:53:22
able to probably be able to extend the usability of the product and finally the third one is bug
1:53:29
something is not working as intended it could either be because there's an issue
1:53:34
with the product that needs to be fixed or we're trying to use a feature in a way that is not supposed to work trust
1:53:41
me that happens a lot now what do you do when you get feedback from the product well the first step is to see if the
1:53:47
information you've got is enough for you to take the idea forward you dwell a lot of times be steering an
1:53:54
idea which you can't figure out the head and feel off now if you can't understand what the user is saying you can't really
1:54:00
help them so make sure that you're able to gather as much information from the users that you need
1:54:08
won't always be possible but you can at least try now ideally the information you need to
1:54:15
take the idea for a word would be what is the problem which is a facing how
1:54:21
would they like us to solve a problem if they have any screenshots videos or visuals
1:54:28
that might help us better understand the problem and lastly how important is it to fix
1:54:35
the problem which brings us to our next topic which is setting a priority on the feedback so
1:54:41
once you've got the feedback the next step is to set the priority on it you will go over the information provided to
1:54:47
make sure that everything is there that free to get started you then do the due diligence to find out the priority on
1:54:55
the feedback now the question that a lot of us struggle with is how much time do you
1:55:01
need to spend on an idea that comes through after you've had the initial bit of information
1:55:06
there is no magic formula no standard sop that I can provide you but here are
1:55:12
some pointers that have helped me over the years number one some ideas keep coming up
1:55:18
again and again over time and the team has decided not to work on them unless
1:55:23
it's been a while or something has changed that makes the idea worthwhile you can prioritize them fairly quickly
1:55:31
the tough part with these ideas is how do you communicate the TEAM stands to
1:55:36
the person who submitted it number two some ideas are too big to be handled in
1:55:42
a short period of time they're more like initiatives to be honest like a holy module or vertical or an application
1:55:51
from the get-go you know that the resource is required to build them a substantial unless they align with the
1:55:56
product Vision strategy or roadmap these ideas are not going to be worked on in the immediate future you should from
1:56:02
time to time investigate them but the exercise is much larger than what you do
1:56:08
for most of the feedback that you get you can classify feedback into four priority levels P1 this is the highest
1:56:15
level of priority and needs immediate attention the team needs to start working on it immediately P2 it is
1:56:23
important to work on this upgrade and someone in the engineering team would pick it up in maybe a week or two P3 it
1:56:32
is nice to have this feature and someone might start working on it in a month
1:56:39
P4 this is a nice to have but there are no plans to work on it in the immediate
1:56:45
future it's important to know that these parties are for on the internal use there is a different way you communicate
1:56:52
to the external stakeholders since they're most more interested in knowing if their idea is going to be worked on
1:56:59
and released here are some common states that you can assign ideas to for external themes
1:57:07
will likely not do these are P4 requests that are not likely to be worked on will
1:57:13
likely do this is a prioritized list of all the items that we've worked on
1:57:18
generally the items at the top of the backlog are put in development queue and
1:57:23
picked up by them when there is capacity in the team in development
1:57:30
the update is being worked on the idea is in development the idea is being
1:57:36
worked on by the engineering team and will be available once it's ready released work on the idea is done and it
1:57:44
is available for everyone I hope you found this section on product feedback useful you will do a lot of
What is a Product Roadmap?
1:57:52
that as product manager going through feedback and listening to what users are saying is critical but you just can't
1:57:58
keep building on the product feedback on ad hoc basis I mean you can
1:58:05
but soon you start feeling like a headless chicken running around from One update to another without feeling
1:58:10
knowing whether you're going on the right path towards your destination your product will look like it's badly
1:58:17
bruised and it has a lot of bandages on it that is where the product roadmap comes
1:58:22
in it gives you a sense of direction on where you're headed and you make sure that most of your
1:58:29
actions are in sync with where the product roadmap needs to be let's type a little bit deeper into what
1:58:37
exactly a product roadmap is before building one so what is a product roadmap it is
1:58:43
representation and communication of the product strategy of the company for the
1:58:49
next 6 12 or 18 months it can be in the form of a document a PowerPoint slide or a Gantt chart the
1:58:56
lots of online tools available that you can also use to build out and showcase your roadmap with
1:59:04
why are product roadmaps important so early on in my career I used to wonder
1:59:10
why it's necessary to have a published roadmap as part of the product team I
1:59:15
was pretty aware of what was going on and what was going to be built in the coming months it was only later that I
1:59:22
realized that every team is busy focusing on their work and probably don't breathe product in and out each
1:59:29
day therefore a published roadmap is critical for the success of any product
1:59:35
team because it promotes a culture of transparency in the organization it
1:59:42
aligns the different themes towards a common goal it inspires the organization
1:59:48
it creates excitement about the future and finally it empowers everyone in the
1:59:55
team to scrutinize it so who is the product roadmap for each stakeholder is
2:00:02
looking for something very specific in the roadmap for example customers want
2:00:07
to know what they can expect in the short or long term prospects evaluating the product want to find out what new
2:00:14
use cases will the product solve for in the future investors want to see the Strategic
2:00:20
direction that the company is taking engineering team wants to know the technical competencies here in the
2:00:26
coming months the sales teams wants to understand features that would fulfill
2:00:31
use cases for their Pipeline and marketing team needs to know what they need to add into their own marketing
2:00:38
roadmap in order to support future releases so what influences the roadmap your
2:00:44
vision of course your goals the external feedback you get from users internal
2:00:50
feedback from your company and finally competitors the product and world map should reflect how you will
2:00:57
respond to the evolving phase of competition will not be able to do this in one day
2:01:03
it's important to take out some time each week to look into what key
2:01:09
competitors are doing what prospects are saying about them track how you compare
2:01:15
against them to a feature Gap analysis and keep it updated identify the ones
2:01:21
that need to be fixed so all this is great but if I wanted to
2:01:26
make a product roadmap how would I go about where will I start well you know frankly all this can
2:01:33
sometimes sound over me but don't worry about it product roadmaps are not built
2:01:39
overnight they are a culmination of cross-functional collaboration of all
2:01:45
teams and is led by the product managers but it doesn't end there
2:01:52
it then becomes a live document that needs to reflect the changing needs of the business
2:01:57
so you will have to shuffle things around and make changes it's not a great habit but it will happen
2:02:04
you can organize your roadmaps in a couple of ways theme based you can have different
2:02:10
themes and projects under them for example improving customer onboarding
2:02:15
can be one of the themes redesigning the sign of flow can be a project under that theme
2:02:22
or you can have an objective based roadmap you can have a high level objective then Club different
2:02:29
development projects under them for example your objective might be to increase Revenue by 17 and the group
2:02:36
together everything that's aimed towards increasing Revenue under that one objective once you've decided what
2:02:44
themes you're going to focus on or the objective that you're going to Target you need to identify all the problems by
2:02:52
going over the feedback from different sources you filter the ones that should be considered worth spending time on use
2:02:59
three filters in this step you ask yourself is this problem urgent
2:03:04
is this pervasive are customers willing to pay for it the reason for this is that you will have hundreds of ideas not
2:03:11
each of them needs to go through the same amount of due diligence
2:03:16
at this steps prioritize the idea based on the data you have consultations with
2:03:22
the stakeholders and the vision of the company there are lots of read Frameworks you
2:03:29
can use to do that for the very simple ones to the more complex ones let's look
2:03:34
at a few of them the first one is rice it was developed at intercom and it
2:03:39
prioritizes features based on four variables and stack ranks then based on
2:03:45
the rise score the four variables are reach which is the percentage of users
2:03:50
who will use a feature impact the value of the features for the users confidence
2:03:57
is how confident are you in the data that you're providing and effort is the resources needed to
2:04:04
build and launch the feature when you have when you get all these values together use the formula for rice
2:04:12
to come to the rice core the feature with the highest rise score uh is the one that you develop first now we made a
2:04:19
very we made some extensive videos on the prioritization framework so if you want to be dive deeper into the rice
2:04:26
framework feel free to look at those videos next is the kanu model it prioritizes features based on customer
2:04:33
satisfaction and implementation effort required to get it out of the door all features are assigned a category
2:04:40
depending on the value you assign to the variables there will be three categories
2:04:45
number one is basic the product doesn't work without them
2:04:51
delightful initial effort into these features would Delight the customers but
2:04:56
it tapers off after a point and third is performance customer satisfaction is
2:05:02
directly proportional to the effort you put in it the third framework is the Moscow method
2:05:09
this method groups all the work into four buckets the first bucket is must
2:05:15
have the second bucket is should have the third bucket is could have and the fourth bucket is would have you assign
2:05:23
resources to the must-haves first and then move down to should halves and
2:05:30
could have won't have is a category of things that you don't intend to tackle
2:05:36
in the short on midterm another way of prioritizing work is by using story
2:05:41
mapping as the name suggests you map out the Journey of how your customers use
2:05:47
the product divide the journey into different segments list out the different actions that make up a segment
2:05:55
this provides one view to all the stakeholders now work with the
2:06:00
stakeholders to prioritize work within each segment if you're interested in learning more about these framework you
2:06:06
can check out some of the videos on our Channel where we take a deep dive into some of them product roadmap is subject
2:06:13
to change you might have given a full-fledged product with my presentation to a packed house and
2:06:19
within weeks you have to shuffle things around and add new items to the roadmap that means pumping a few off the roadmap
2:06:26
and it can be frustrating but business is always changing and you need to either adapt or perish at times
2:06:34
flexibility can hurt the productivity of the team more than the gains it provides
2:06:39
as a product manager you are that gatekeeper who balances the need to be flexible but not so much that it brings
2:06:47
the development to a standstill you can do this by doing the due diligence on
2:06:52
the new items and analyzing whether they in fact qualify to be higher up in the
2:06:58
prioritized list of ideas the goal is always to provide as much stability as possible to the team doing
2:07:06
the downstream work so how do you communicate a roadmap communication is dependent on the
2:07:13
audience will the master road map that you can share with the entire company then build customized ones for key
2:07:20
stakeholders that can highlight and focus on things that interest them
2:07:26
presentation of a roadmap should only include high level information about the
2:07:31
project steer clear of getting into the nitty-gritty details of implementation
2:07:37
not everyone needs to know them but always be prepared and ready with
2:07:42
all the finer details in case it ever comes up in the Q a sessions
2:07:48
it is easy for the roadmap sessions to get out of fan here are a few things you can do to avoid that
2:07:54
share the final roadmap a day ahead of the presentation it gives people some times to go over it in advance Define
2:08:01
the agenda before the start of the presentation be clear about how much time you have to
2:08:07
spend on each section of the roadmap at least the last 20 minutes for Q a
2:08:14
some questions will end up becoming a discussion on implementation it might
2:08:19
not be relevant for the entire team part those questions for a side discussion after the presentation
2:08:27
when you present to customers or prospects do not commit to anything because as discussed
2:08:34
product roadmaps are subject to change and the last thing you want is your
2:08:39
customers making a commitment to their customers based on your commitment to
2:08:44
them yes that's a very long sentence so the jury is still out on whether you
2:08:50
should show Tech debt in a road map my take on it is it depends on the audience
2:08:56
for internal themes I show large texted items as part of the roadmap otherwise the question comes up what is the rest
2:09:02
of the engineering team working on when presenting to customers I do not show Tech Deck because most of them
2:09:10
don't care about it or worse they might look at it and start having doubts on
2:09:15
the stability of the platform in the end it's all about balance a road
2:09:20
map that keeps in mind the needs of the users and business now while
2:09:26
anticipating what they will need in the future will make the desired impact
Breaking Down The Product Roadmap
2:09:32
in the next section we're going to look at how to break down the roadmap into more actionable chunks of features epics
2:09:40
users stories and tasks as a product manager you are responsible for
2:09:46
strategic work as well as tactical strategic work involves you know defining the product strategy and the
2:09:52
vision for the company tactical work is everything else that goes into converting that Vision into reality
2:10:00
a good part of this video we will spend on discussing why is it actually important to break down a large project
2:10:07
or a feature or a problem into smaller bits because lots of times they are
2:10:14
teams uh don't seem to agree on the importance of of this aspect of product
2:10:21
development and when they don't agree and believe in it what ends up happening
2:10:27
is you end up building uh you know user stories that aren't necessarily users
2:10:33
stories so we'll talk more about that later but why is it important is because the
2:10:40
devils in the is in the details you can't tell your team to build something without defining how it should behave
2:10:47
otherwise they will end up building it in the way they understand and not how
2:10:54
it needs to work I have actually seen this happen over and over again you go
2:10:59
about building uh what seems to be a small feature Without Really defining it
2:11:05
without putting the thought or time or effort into it and then as the team starts building it out without
2:11:11
requirements they realize oh my God this is actually not a small feature it's a big feature so it's important to break
2:11:16
down the projects into smaller chunks in order to actually estimate it as well so
2:11:22
it's uh better to realize this uh before as a product manager versus sitting in a
2:11:27
grooming meeting with the development team so let's look at a hypothetical example to explain the importance of
2:11:34
this further your company has a Blog Page your the marketing team believes
2:11:40
that the engagement of the blog is low they look at the numbers and they think there is room for for improvement and
2:11:46
they have they have a hypothesis which is a frequent tract more on the blog
2:11:51
page it will need to increase in traffic now now the team believes uh that the
2:11:57
different types of solutions that can do it and uh their final
2:12:02
conclusion is that if you could add the ability to comment
2:12:07
on the blog then that would mean then it would increase now the team comes to you and
2:12:14
say hey now this is what we want to build so can you help us so now we are assuming that we've done all the new
2:12:20
religions and we prioritize this and this is what we want to build so the product manager you have two options you
2:12:25
can go talk to the engineering manager and tell them hey I just want to add the
2:12:31
ability to add a comment on blog posts I and the engineering manager takes it
2:12:36
over so in this option uh this is where your accounts and you leave it up to the engineering team so two things might
2:12:43
happen the engineering team might have this amazing superpower they might be able to read your mind and know exactly how you want
2:12:50
the feature to work and that's what happens most of the time no it doesn't that almost no actually
2:12:57
that never happens what really happens is the team will start building something
2:13:03
but there will be tons of questions on how things should grow them you'll be able to answer some of them
2:13:09
others you probably hadn't thought about which is all right for example should people be able to reply to other
2:13:15
people's comments can anybody comment or only login users can comment what should
2:13:23
be the word limit on the comments now what seemed like an easy two-day job was
2:13:28
slowly started to become a multi-week project with more things to figure out in the end what will happen is uh
2:13:36
the feature will not be released because there'll be too many unanswered questions nobody will really know what
2:13:42
to do and it will keep getting delayed and delayed and everybody will just be very unhappy
2:13:47
now there's an option to the right way to do it so as a product manager you take out the
2:13:53
time and put in the effort to list down exactly how this feature that the marketing team wants needs to behave you
2:14:01
define what the first iteration of it should look like
2:14:06
you break down the requirements into smaller parts you take a take out time
2:14:12
to think of all the edge cases you identify and list of things that are out
2:14:20
of scope for this project now if you go with this option what will result in is
2:14:26
there will be less questions during the development feature will be ready on time
2:14:33
and it will work exactly the way you want it to behave well so I guess everybody would choose
2:14:41
option two right you know it seems like the better option so now how do you go about uh working
2:14:49
through an option too so let's look at a framework of epics user stories and
2:14:55
tasks which is a great way of translating business requirement into product
2:15:01
features it has a lot of advantages number one smaller stories are easier for the
2:15:08
engineering team to understand and work on they're also easier to track and give you more accurate understanding of the
2:15:15
progress of the project it also gives you more flexibility of
2:15:21
releasing the feature in smaller iterations and you can get feedback sooner from users which is great
2:15:28
you can also gauge the success of failure of the project through the feedback
2:15:34
some questions come to mind how small should the user story be is there a
2:15:39
method to the madness so let's look at each of the elements on the top you will have your feature
2:15:49
or the problem you're trying to solve now that feature or problem can be broken down into smaller effects
2:15:56
under every epic will be multiple usual stories and underuser stories they'll be
2:16:03
smaller tasks now let's look at each of them what what
2:16:08
is an epic so an epic is a logical collection or grouping of user stories that fit
2:16:15
together a project can have many effects and each epic can have many user stories now
2:16:22
there's some common questions that come up during uh the discussion of epics the
2:16:28
first one is does it make sense to have an epic for every release absolutely no sometimes you might have
2:16:34
really small user story that you want to release but if you have a set of user stories that relate to some common problem
2:16:42
you're trying to solve then you can actually group them under an ethic but absolutely no you don't need to have an
2:16:47
epic for every release you're not trying to create extra work or processes uh
2:16:53
when it's not required do you have to release all the user stories in an epic together
2:16:59
there is no hard and fast food for that one it depends on what makes it easier
2:17:05
for the team to manage and track the product you can either have multiple release versions in one Epic or have one
2:17:13
Epic for each release for user Stories the end goal is to make the theme slide
2:17:20
easier when tracking these project if it's not doing that then you need to
2:17:25
find a better way of working let's talk about user stories now or user story defines
2:17:30
an interaction that the user has with the product and it can be independently tested a very common format that you'll
2:17:38
see is as a user I want to and then you explain what the end
2:17:44
code is for the user the user in this case can be a customer or a prospect who is using a feature or
2:17:52
it can view internal stakeholders if you're trying to build something for your internal teams in this case uh the
2:17:57
marketing theme so this statement is followed by the acceptance criteria which is a series of bullet points which
2:18:05
form the boundaries around which the solution needs to work it would be
2:18:10
something like the solution should be able to do X Y but the solution shouldn't do Z so the next thing you
2:18:18
want to talk about is tasks over the years I have heard a lot of different definitions around tasks for me tasks a set of things that the developing theme
2:18:24
needs to do in order to complete a feature uh more stories would generally be further broken down into tasks but
2:18:31
you don't necessarily need a user story to uh to complete a task because a task
2:18:36
might be be you know building apis or doing some back-end work or doing some
2:18:43
other things that need to be done in order to release that user story now
2:18:49
anybody in the team can create a task in larger team it's better to Define
2:18:55
type of class it makes reporting easier in most cases the development team will break down your stories into smaller
2:19:01
tasks like you said so I hope you uh you got the gist off of you trying to do
2:19:08
with with the feature right you're just breaking it down into smaller smaller chunks uh so that can be consumed by the
2:19:14
team now this format is used globally by a lot of companies but there are
2:19:20
obviously some challenges with it as well because no format of framework is perfect you run into issues at some
2:19:27
point uh some of them that I have personally run into are you know sometimes I've had the engineering team
2:19:34
come and tell me hey the user story is not broken up enough you break it down further and you learn as you go down the
2:19:40
line sometimes I've been told hey you have broken it down way too much so you have to try and find that balance
2:19:47
um I've also had uh teams that have actually converted development tasks into user stories which is a big No-No
2:19:54
RC should not happen and use the stories haven't converted into development tasks
2:20:00
there is also a question when you're trying to estimate should you estimate a
2:20:06
user story or a task and then who owns what like does the
2:20:14
product manager own the Epic and user stories and the dev team owns the task so these are some of the things that uh
2:20:20
I actually don't have answers for uh the only answer I have it depends it depends on the team you know so you have
2:20:26
to talk to your team because uh in or before implementing uh this because eventually the goal is to make
2:20:32
everyone's life adapt easier but if it's not doing that it is causing
2:20:40
more friction routines and it's not doing its job so you have to balance the need for the framework versus what works
2:20:45
best for the team you also need to make sure that you educate the team on how you actually breaking down the user stories and dropping them take their
2:20:52
feedback and iterate and uh until you found the right balance
How to Write User Stories
2:20:59
user stories are small pieces of a large puzzle just like this thousand piece
2:21:06
Naruto puzzle featured above it took me and my wife almost six months
2:21:12
to complete it now that's a completely different user story that will not be discussing in this video but in the end
2:21:18
we had to go to the eye doctor and get our eyes checked
2:21:24
these stories are an integral part of the software development process if you work in product management design or
2:21:31
development you will be working with user stories a lot they become a constant companion
2:21:37
so you want to build a product or a feature do you just start writing user stories uh with your idea no you have to
2:21:45
go through the entire process of discovery talk to customers when you until you finally figure out uh
2:21:51
what you want to build you also have to do the prioritization exercise so for this video we'll just assume that you've
2:21:57
already done all the good stuff and you now are in a position where you want to implement your idea throw set of user
2:22:05
stories what will focus in this video on is first why do we need
2:22:12
a user's story who is it for who uses user stories who writes them key
2:22:18
elements of user stories then we'll dive deeper into the actual gist of user
2:22:25
stories you talk about user story mapping we'll look at an example we'll then look
2:22:31
at feature hierarchy and then we'll end up with the user story template that we'll end up using day to day in your
2:22:38
daily work and look at also the invest framework so that you can do a sanity
2:22:44
check on your user stories before sending it to the development team so why do we need a user story it's a good
2:22:51
question why can't we just start building out a software without a user story well you can try it but uh you
2:22:58
won't necessarily end up anywhere you'll have too many questions by the end of the day you get super confused and you
2:23:03
just give up what a user story helps you do is it helps you take these small concrete
2:23:10
steps to achieve the vision that you have for your product it does it by helping you one focus on what is
2:23:18
important agree on the scope of the product prioritize the order of
2:23:24
development align the different teams to achieve the common goal
2:23:30
estimate the effort required to completing the feature track how close
2:23:37
you are to completing your product goals collaborate with cross-functions themes
2:23:42
on what it would take to complete the story and finally fit all the moving
2:23:49
parts of the puzzle together you start with what's most important and then move
2:23:54
up and build layers of feature and functionality that enhance the user
2:23:59
experience and brings value to them who uses a user story product managers
2:24:05
it enables product managers to get translate their thoughts into a living document is it's important for them
2:24:12
because it enables them to get feedback on what they think needs to happen or
2:24:17
and communicate the final expectations with the team developers and qas use our
2:24:23
user story as the single source of truth if they have any questions about how
2:24:29
things should work they eventually go back to the user story if they still have some questions or
2:24:36
concerns then they go and talk to the product manager engineering managers use user stories to estimate and track
2:24:42
Project based on the resources they have available and designers use user stories
2:24:48
to build out how the user will interact with the product who writes the user
2:24:54
stories well you think this would be an easy one to answer but actually it's not
2:24:59
you think it's product managers but a lot of companies don't have product managers what yes that is the
2:25:06
reality of the day you might end up working in companies that don't have product managers and you have to deal
2:25:12
with it so you know what I have seen I've seen user Stories being written by product managers business analysts software
2:25:19
architect engineering managers developers CEOs co-founders I'm not a big fan of titles so instead
2:25:25
of focusing on who this uh title is that is writing the user so let's focus on
2:25:31
the skills that a person used to have in order to write these user stories one empathy for users if you don't
2:25:39
understand the challenges that users are going through you will not be able to write a user story in-depth understanding of the user's
2:25:47
needs grasp on the product vision and strategy of the company understanding
2:25:52
the needs of the business understanding the competitive landscape working knowledge of the existing
2:25:59
product and all the relevant features in most cases this is basically the job description
2:26:06
for a product manager opening now let's look at the four key elements
2:26:12
of a user's Story number one is user driven each user story is driven by a user's
2:26:20
need a particular type of users is always the focus of every user Story the
2:26:25
completion of the user story helps the user in some way it could be big or
2:26:31
small directly or indirectly if you ever come across a user story that you can't
2:26:36
relate to a user then make sure to highlight that with the team something
2:26:42
needs to change a user doesn't necessarily need to be the end user of your external product it
2:26:49
can be one of the internal stakeholders who are using some internal products number two outcome
2:26:56
as discussed above the each user's story has a purpose at the completion of the user story that
2:27:04
purpose should be fulfilled if the user story does not achieve the desired
2:27:10
outcome then it needs to be reworked this can happen if performing the action
2:27:17
described in the user's Theory actually does not give you the desired result
2:27:23
number three acceptance criteria achieving the desired outcome is just
2:27:28
one part of your user story right there are there are lots of different ways and millions of ways in which you can
2:27:35
get to the desired outcome but there is only one way that it is acceptable to
2:27:40
the team because that is the way the team thinks is the right way for the users that forms your acceptance
2:27:46
criteria and is documented as a part of the user story number four definition of done
2:27:54
I can't tell you how many meetings I've sat in at the end of the Springs where this confusion about the
2:28:01
definition of done everybody has a different answer for what done means some people say hey that means the
2:28:08
developer has completed the story somebody else will say the queue has tested the story somebody else will say
2:28:14
the designer has reviewed this story which means it's done or somebody else would say hey no no no
2:28:20
the regression has to be complete before you say the story is done so please try to avoid this confusion it
2:28:27
is important that we are all clear about what done means a common definition of
2:28:33
dung that has worked for me is the product manager has tested the user
2:28:39
story along with the developer QA and designer the user story passes all the
2:28:46
acceptance criteria is satisfies both functional and design requirements
2:28:52
number five open and subject to change one of the goals of writing user story
2:28:58
is because you want to make sure everybody is clear on the definition of done but things might change that might lead
2:29:05
to the changing scope of the user stories some examples are you know you go to The Grooming meeting and the deaf
2:29:10
team finds out after doing the spies that the user story it's it's not possible it's not technically feasible
2:29:16
to do so you might have to change the scope you might have to rewrite the user story they might feel at the current
2:29:22
implementation will actually take a lot of time or the needs of the business has
2:29:28
changed so make sure uh that you're okay and are
2:29:33
you flexible about uh the fact that user stories might change even though you are
2:29:39
okay with user stories changing make sure there's a valid reason to change it
2:29:44
just like the ones we discussed above and you're not changing uh the user story at the women fancy of anyone and
2:29:52
everyone because that will only lead to chaos all right now comes the fun stuff uses story mapping I really enjoy this
2:29:59
exercise it's one of the methods used by product teams to find ways to solve problem faced by users you start with
2:30:06
the blank canvas or board and map out the journey for the users through your
2:30:13
product or service key actions and interactions they have challenges bottlenecks that they face
2:30:20
things that are nice to have must have could have should have you do this
2:30:25
exercise before uh launching a new product as well as at regular intervals after
2:30:31
the initial release it helps you keep the users need front and center as the
2:30:37
product grows and becomes more complicated who do you invite to a user story session well the short answer is anybody
2:30:44
who can help improve the product but you can't you know invite the entire
2:30:49
company uh to this exercise that's just not feasible but what you can make sure is that there
2:30:55
is representation from uh different teams like sales customer success
2:31:01
support PCS design development you will discuss uh how to actually you
2:31:07
know organize and run a user story mapping session in a separate video for
2:31:12
now we're just gonna assume that you've done your user story mapping exercise
2:31:18
and uh you have something up on the board and we're going to look at an example of it right now so for the
2:31:25
purpose of understanding uh user story mapping uh let's forget about technology
2:31:30
for a minute what if if I ask you to draw a user story map for buying a shirt
2:31:38
the old school way you might ask what is this old school way it is the way in which you drive
2:31:46
to a store you walk to an aisle and buy a shirt what who does that well my dad still
2:31:55
does that I'm sure you all that too uh but the reason we're doing this is uh
2:32:01
because we use so used to technology and if I uh go through this example with you
2:32:06
know within actual online experience you will just use your experience of with these products to
2:32:14
just write down the user story map which which kind of defeats the purpose because you'll be focusing all the
2:32:20
features you have seen in your experience so let's bear with me for some time and let's let's try to go to a
2:32:28
store to buy a t-shirt so think about it for a minute what are
2:32:33
some of the steps that come to your mind if you have to go to the store uh first I guess I would try and find the store
2:32:40
that sells shirts then I'd go to the store pick up a shirt and then pay for it
2:32:48
well yeah sounds you know fairly high level but I think it is good now some questions come to mind do the
2:32:55
users have car do they use public transport what type of shirt do they
2:33:00
want they have a price range any particular Branch they like
2:33:07
can they go to the store anytime how much do they want to pay
2:33:13
well yeah there's so many questions right and the the there's a barrage of questions that we can throw at you what
2:33:21
would really help is if we knew who was going to buy this store understand the user what the needs and wants are what
2:33:28
are the challenges they face in short wouldn't it be great if we had an
2:33:33
in-depth understanding of the target user Persona that would really make a
2:33:38
life easier wouldn't it well let's assume for the purpose of this exercise that you've done all that
2:33:45
and you've been able to make informed decisions and you have a user story map
2:33:52
in front of you that looks something like this and again we're assuming that you worked
2:34:00
with all your sales customer success and all your stakeholders and you know after discussing with them this is something
2:34:06
that all of you agree on now let's look at the user Journey map uh what you see
2:34:12
is you see three levels in three different colors uh blue green and yellow
2:34:18
at the very top is the goal of your exercise or for the user the user wants
2:34:24
to go to the store and buy a shirt the next level in green
2:34:30
are the three key things that they do
2:34:35
in order to make or achieve the goal we go to the store they find the T-shirt
2:34:42
and they make the payment the third level
2:34:47
is the one in yellow where you further breaking down those actions into smaller
2:34:55
bits for example if you talk about finding your shirt
2:35:01
uh they can be smaller actions that that lead to the use of finding the shirt you
2:35:07
have to locate the eye you have to look through options you have to select the shirt you like try them out and pick out
2:35:12
a winner now like we said right at the top in blue is
2:35:19
what you'd call your goal or the theme in green is the level two which is
2:35:25
generally or epic and everything that you see in yellow are uses stories so
2:35:31
this is how you will organize your users story or your project or your goal
2:35:39
inside of jeera or any other software that you use on the very top would be a
2:35:45
gold or a theme of buying the shirt then you'll create different epics and Below
2:35:50
those epics you will create all these different user stories in this in this
2:35:56
video we'll take up one of those user stories and try to use the uses user
2:36:02
story template to come up with the acceptance criteria for that particular
2:36:09
user story now we'll talk about the user story template and then we will apply
2:36:15
that template to an actual example from the user story map that we have created
2:36:22
a user's story consists of four parts one is the user the second is the action
2:36:30
the third is the result and the fourth is the acceptance criteria
2:36:37
how it goes is as a user I want to be able to perform an action
2:36:43
so that I can get an XYZ result and then you list out all the acceptance
2:36:49
criteria which is the boundary within which your solution needs to work
2:36:56
okay so how would you apply this except this user story template to an actual story
2:37:03
so let's pick up the user story from the Epic about finding your shirt and build
2:37:11
the user story about locating the shirt I this is how I would develop the story as
2:37:17
a user I want to be able to find the shirt aisle of the store
2:37:24
where shirts are kept see this is the action that you want to take so that I
2:37:29
can choose the one that I want to take which is the result the acceptance criteria of this could
2:37:36
look like number one the search section should be marked clearly so that the user can find it
2:37:43
it should have a banner 10 by 2 feet on both sides of the aisle
2:37:49
that are easily visible to the user from a distance arrows on the floor should point the
2:37:56
user to various I store associates should be trained to help users find the
2:38:04
item I hope uh this exercise hasn't left all of you super confused that wasn't
2:38:10
the goal you know I picked up a non-tech example for a
2:38:16
reason because I want you to focus on user's story thinking through the different steps or the Journey of the
2:38:22
user instead of focusing on the technology or the execution part of
2:38:27
it or getting bias with what you would generally see across all the different websites that you browse to buy T-shirts
2:38:35
for yourself because you would intuitively know what to do right so uh
2:38:40
I do have a fun exercise for you what if you think about it from a different angle what if you had to do the same
2:38:47
exercise for an online website what do you think is the equivalent of
2:38:54
this user story in an online storefront what does finding the aisle mean
2:39:01
take a second think about it for a minute I'll wait one two sorry guys I can't beat more I'm
2:39:07
very impatient so what comes to mind search bar filter types yes you can now
2:39:14
see you know websites with search bars and filters coming coming in front of
2:39:20
you uh well it could actually be either you know it depends on what the overall ux strategy of the company is what the
2:39:26
goal of the company is is it to help users find things really really fast as
2:39:33
fast as possible or is it to get users to have an immersive experience and discover things as they browse the same
2:39:40
actually applies to Brick and Motors too but I guess is it's easier to relate to online websites these days than it is to
2:39:47
Brick and Mortar stores okay now that you've you've written down a user story you uh you feel really happy about it
2:39:55
there is one thing I would advise you to do use the invest framework because one of the biggest challenges I faced
2:40:02
early on in my career while writing user story was to figure out where it actually started and where it
2:40:09
ended yeah that is true guys it gets super confusing by the one use story that you've written is actually two user
2:40:16
stories and does it matter in these situations look at the invest
2:40:22
framework stands for
2:40:28
independent negotiable valuable estimable small and testable let's look
2:40:36
at all the different parts independent means the user story should be complete within itself you should be
2:40:42
able to perform actions in the story by themselves negotiable software development can be
2:40:49
confusing we've talked about this before on one hand you want to provide trading consistent to the team but you want to
2:40:56
be flexible about the business needs or the other other technical challenges you guys face
2:41:01
so uh what you have come up with the user story here when you take you to the
2:41:06
train it's negotiable right the scope of it the acceptance criteria everything can cheat everything is on the table for discussion with the team it has to be
2:41:13
valuable it has to have a positive impact on the user and The Business
2:41:19
it could be time saving ease of use solving a problem uh improving the user experience
2:41:26
reducing just something there should be a value to the user directly or the indirectly and to the company as well
2:41:32
a user is generally part of the user story is generally part of a theme that
2:41:38
relates to a larger goal for the organization the user story should be estimable
2:41:44
because the dev team should be able to look at it and tell you how much effort it would take for them to deliver it
2:41:51
sometime this might not just this might not happen the first time you show them the user so they might ask for spikes spikes
2:42:00
are small time boxed tasks that development teams undertakes
2:42:07
to figure out the technical implementation of user stories
2:42:13
now if your user study has complete incomplete information
2:42:20
or you know you leave something to interpretation you will not be able to get a fair estimate so in this case your
2:42:27
the user story is considered incomplete and you need to rework the user story as a product manager this does not mean
2:42:33
that as a product manager you will have all the answers you know the first time you take the user story to the team
2:42:40
the user story that you write and you discuss with the dev team is the starting point it is actually the
2:42:47
beginning of your of creating a complete user story lots of things will change
2:42:53
questions will come that will have to go and find answers for uh you know feedback you'll get which you'll have to
2:43:00
uh then work into the user Story So based on the discussion you'll you'll
2:43:06
update the user story to its final form which will then be used by the team
2:43:12
small we've talked about this a lot user's Theory should be really really small it
2:43:19
makes it easier to track tests and manage them it also mitigates the risk
2:43:24
in case things need to change so whenever you write a user's story ask yourself can I break it down further
2:43:31
while adhering to the rest of the invest framework testable once you complete
2:43:38
the user story it should be testable by the team either in its entirety
2:43:46
or through use cases that can validate it to the extent possible
2:43:51
you can test whether the feature works as expected and uh
2:43:58
whether it has the impact can only be validated when it goes out in the market so that's basically the gist of the
2:44:05
invest framework I have personally used it millions of time and it has been very helpful for me uh when when doing uh
2:44:14
those check on the user story uh it helps me get a little less confused
2:44:20
so I hope this video has helped you and uh you'll be able to write these stories
2:44:27
a little bit better after this so far so good you've learned how to
Scrum Process Explained
2:44:35
write user stories like Pro now it's time to learn how to work with development and bring your stories to
2:44:42
life this is when it gets real it's time to start building out the actual product
2:44:48
for this you have to work closely with the development and design team let's look at some things that are important
2:44:55
for you to understand as a product manager at this stage there are two popular ways using which
2:45:02
you can develop your products they're both great and you pick one over
2:45:07
the other based on the needs of your team let's look at each of them
2:45:13
the first one is Scrum software development has gone through a
2:45:18
sea of change from the early days from architectural patterns to design Frameworks things are always changing
2:45:25
waterfall scrum agile lean extreme programming and kanban are terms you
2:45:33
will definitely encounter if you stay long enough in software development
2:45:39
scrum is a framework scrum helps people work together to
2:45:44
solve problems software companies all over the world use come to deliver
2:45:49
incremental improvements that bring value to users now why is it so popular
2:45:56
is because before scrum it was hard to find a framework that took into account
2:46:01
the changing needs of the business the older Frameworks and methodologies put
2:46:07
to reach it product development was treated like this giant blob and users
2:46:13
saw increments and improvements at a very slow pace scrum enabled companies
2:46:19
to provide faster incremental improvements to users now who makes up a scrum theme a scrum
2:46:29
team is a small group by Design the following rules make up a scrub team
2:46:35
a product owner or manager they are responsible for maintaining the product
2:46:40
backlog the backlog is a collection of items that the development team needs to work on it is prioritized so that the
2:46:48
team can focus on tasks that bring the most value to users the product owner or
2:46:55
manager is the representative of the product team in scrum the responsible
2:47:00
for clarifying any questions that the development team might have
2:47:06
questions can be about specific feature requirements overall product vision and goals or the
2:47:13
business impact of the development projects next you have the scrum Master
2:47:19
the scrum Master is the torch bearer of scrum in your organization
2:47:25
they make sure that everybody feels supported in the scrum process whenever
2:47:31
issues arise it is Day Road to get the team together to find solution they
2:47:37
coach the organization to get better at applying the scrum Frameworks they make
2:47:43
the development process transparent for all the stakeholders
2:47:48
then you have developers developers focus on making incremental improvements
2:47:53
in each Sprint they play a key role in planning this print the product owner or manager identifies
2:48:00
items that need development effort in order of priority the developers then
2:48:06
bring in the work to the Sprint that they can commit to delivering by the end of the Sprint cycle scrum
2:48:14
defines the rules and responsibilities very clearly but in reality your company
2:48:21
might not have all the rules for example a lot of smaller companies don't have scrum Masters in such cases the product
2:48:29
owner or the engineering managers lead the team to follow the scrum guidelines some companies don't have product owners
2:48:36
they might have product managers or business analysts or both in some cases the product manager
2:48:43
creates the user stories and the engineering team breaks it down further during the Sprint planning
2:48:49
Point here is that the title does not matter if people with the right skills are
2:48:57
there to do the job so what makes up a scrum first up is Sprint Sprint is a
2:49:05
time-bound recurring event during which the developers work on making incremental updates the length of this
2:49:12
print can vary between one to four weeks the length of the Sprint should be long
2:49:18
enough to give developers enough time to complete a meaningful amount of work but
2:49:24
it shouldn't be so long that the business starts to wonder when they will see the next release
2:49:30
I have seen two weeks friends work out well for most companies product backlog
2:49:35
this is a list of all the things that need to be developed during the Sprint planning meeting the engineering team
2:49:41
looks at the product backlog items are moved from the product backlog to the Sprint backlog until the theme reaches
2:49:48
its capacity Sprint backlog during the Sprint planning meeting the engineering
2:49:54
team identifies items they can complete in a given Sprint knowing the Sprint
2:49:59
velocity the items together form the Sprint backlog should not increase the
2:50:06
scope of a Sprint after it starts but you can reduce it if in the course of
2:50:12
development you realize that there are unknowns that team hadn't planned for and this happens you should talk to your
2:50:19
product owner and decide on the best course of action Sprint planning the Sprint planning
2:50:26
meeting takes place a day before the beginning of the new Sprint the goal of
2:50:32
this meeting is to go over the product backlog come up with a rough estimate for items and add them to the Sprint
2:50:40
backlog this is the interactive session between the developers the product owner and the scrum Master any doubts ways
2:50:47
should be clarified in this meeting or added as an action item to be followed up and resolved later I have often
2:50:55
noticed that teams suffer from planning fatigue as a result not much attention
2:51:00
is paid to the requirement at this stage this causes issues later on during
2:51:06
development so better try to avoid it daily scrum stand up every scrum theme
2:51:13
meets daily for not more than 15 minutes the meeting is held at the same time and
2:51:18
place each day the goal is to get a quick update from each member everyone
2:51:23
answers the following three questions what they worked on yesterday any blockers or issues they're facing what
2:51:30
will they focus on today parking lot is a term used during scrum meetings it is used when an issue is
2:51:37
taking too much time and needs to be discussed separately it means that you park your issue till
2:51:45
the end of the meeting once the meeting ends the right set of people can get together to solve the issues
2:51:52
print review at the end of the scrum a review meeting is held the goal of the meeting is to go
2:51:58
over the Sprint and close things that have been completed and confirmed to the definition of done
2:52:04
it is an opportunity for the team to look at what has been accomplished and what has changed during the Sprint this
2:52:11
provides them insights on how the Sprint can be planned better in the future the
2:52:16
Sprint retrospective this meeting takes place of the completion of the Sprint
2:52:22
when the Sprint meeting review meeting is complete the goal of this meeting is to look back at the Sprint and discuss
2:52:28
ways to improve the following three questions are very effective in running retrospective meetings what went well
2:52:36
what didn't go well and how can we improve the retrospective is an opportunity for
2:52:42
everybody to share their unique experience sometimes people might feel shy to share their opinion on public
2:52:48
forum retrospectives can also become repetitive sometimes our people and
2:52:54
people can start getting bored so you might want to spice things up and make it interesting to keep everybody
2:52:59
engaged one fun way is to add a fourth section called shout outs it's an opportunity to
2:53:06
thank your teammates who supported you and helped you during the Sprint this
2:53:11
exercise is a great moral booster for the team scrum has a lot of benefits for
2:53:17
teams that invest in it let's look at some of them number one is transparency
2:53:23
everyone in the team is aware of what is the development queue they know what is
2:53:29
expected from them at the end of the Sprint product owner keeps all the stakeholders
2:53:35
in the loop on what to expect at the end of each Sprint as a result there is no
2:53:42
ambiguity on how much progress is being made towards the achievement of product goals
2:53:48
number two is flexibility scrum is designed to work in the real world it
2:53:53
takes into account the unpredictability of the business and how new information can cause plans
2:54:00
to change scrum focuses on incremental improvements to meet product goals this
2:54:06
means that you don't invest too much time in development at one go
2:54:11
you can change priorities as they come in to focus scrum also lets you
2:54:16
customize its process to suit your needs for example the length of the Sprint
2:54:23
the time allocated to daily standups or the size of your scrum Team all of them
2:54:30
can change number three is Clarity one of the big challenges with development
2:54:36
is that we sometimes tend to forget what we discuss that can cause confusion
2:54:43
Trump makes sure that everyone is clear on the definition of done it is agreed
2:54:49
upon during the Sprint planning meeting and used during the Sprint review meetings before closing tickets it also
2:54:55
gives Clarity to the stakeholders on what to expect if they disagree with what's in the upcoming Sprint they can
2:55:03
go and talk to the product owner on how things are prioritized and finally scrum
2:55:08
helps remove redundancy scrum encourages efficient working documentation is one
2:55:14
of the examples come is come you only document what's necessary and needed you
2:55:21
document what you decide your Milestones actionable items that need to be tracked
2:55:27
there are a few challenges with scrum because no process of framework is
2:55:34
perfect while scrum addresses issues faced by the users with older Frameworks
2:55:41
it creates some of its own for example applying and managing
2:55:47
Sprints can be a challenging and time consuming proposition especially if you're just starting out
2:55:54
your scrum Journey you will also face issues estimating work that you take on in the Sprint a
2:56:01
lot of teams use Point poker but it's just a guesstimate you need to track
2:56:07
your team's velocity over a long period of time to bring in some level of accuracy on how much work you can do in
2:56:14
a Sprint so scrum is fun but there is another one that can do the
Kanban (Board | Principles | Process)
2:56:22
job and it's called kanban so let's learn a bit more about kanban
2:56:28
as well so what is kanban kanban is a visual way of managing and completing work its
2:56:35
focus is to make you faster in completing the work that is in progress it does so by focusing on removing
2:56:42
bottleneck that exists for the team you will often hear kanban is lean scrum
2:56:49
is agile what does that even mean it means that the primary goal of kanban
2:56:54
is to increase the speed of the work in progress on the other hand the goal of scrum is
2:57:03
to deliver working software as quickly as possible kanban comes to life with the kanban
2:57:09
board the goal of this board is to provide transparency to everyone on the
2:57:15
work being done let's look at some of the key components that make up the canvar board
2:57:21
first up is cards the kanban card gives you all the important information regarding the work there is no
2:57:29
prescribed format for what needs to be and on the card and what can't you should always put what your team
2:57:37
finds useful in it think of it this way if you had a physical kanban board in
2:57:42
your office and one of the leaders walked by they should be able to understand what
2:57:49
is happening and the current state of the team by looking at the cards I've listed down some of the common
2:57:55
information that you will find in kanbuan cards the cars usually have a
2:58:01
title which is basically telling you what the work is about it will have a story number for tracking purposes due
2:58:07
date of when it needs to be completed the type of work whether it's a story
2:58:13
bug or a task platform information whether it is something leading to the website or the
2:58:20
mobile apps this is iOS or Android release information which releases is it
2:58:26
going to be part of and assigned to who is it assigned to
2:58:31
next up is columns the current state of work is defined by columns all work in a
2:58:37
particular stage resides under the same column there is no limitation on what you can call your column or the total
2:58:43
number of columns on the board this will make it too long otherwise it will become unmanageable each card travels
2:58:51
across from one column to the other from left to right till it reaches its destination so how
2:58:58
does one decide what columns make sense for you by looking at your workflow ask
2:59:04
yourselves what happens to the work once it lands in your team's queue
2:59:10
let's look at this board it will give you an example of the different columns that teams can have
2:59:17
you can have a prioritized backlog column all things that a team needs to work on come in under this column it is
2:59:25
prioritized from top to bottom so that when bandwidth opens up in the engineering team new items can be picked
2:59:32
up you can have a development column all items that are being actively worked on
2:59:37
by developers or you can have a testing column all items that are being tested by the QA team and finally you can have
2:59:45
something like a done column everything that has been completed and is ready for release is comes in this
2:59:51
column an important concept that is applied across the entire kanban board
2:59:56
is the work in progress this is the work being done by the team
3:00:01
you can look at the total teamwork in progress each column work in progress or
3:00:08
even each person's work in progress it tells you what is the total number of things that are being worked on at this
3:00:16
point of time however work in progress doesn't always tell you what the total workload on the
3:00:24
team is from work in progress comes work in progress limits notion behind the work
3:00:31
and progress limits is that if you focus on a thousand different things at once
3:00:37
you'll not be able to make much progress the idea is to set boundaries on how
3:00:43
many things the team and its members can juggle at any given point of time
3:00:48
if you give them more things the efficiency starts getting battered bottleneck starts to emerge and nothing
3:00:55
gets done you should set your initial whip limits based on what the team
3:01:01
thinks will work and then tweak it as you move along you will find that you did either one of
3:01:08
the two you either overestimated your team's capacity or for doing work in this case you'll begin
3:01:15
to see all the kanban metrics correct or you underestimated your team's capacity
3:01:21
as a result business will see work getting shipped at a slower Pace than
3:01:26
expected but there's no reason to be worried it's an iterative process you learn from the
3:01:33
experience and eventually find the right balance and the right whip limits there are different kinds of flip limits
3:01:40
for example you can have a board web limit which is the maximum number of
3:01:45
cards on the board at any given time you can have column limits which is the
3:01:51
number maximum number of cards on each column at any given point of time each
3:01:57
column can also have their own whip limits and you can have Team limits which is
3:02:04
the maximum number of cars that can be assigned to each person in the team at any given point of times columns divide
3:02:11
the work vertically swimlies divide the work horizontally from left to right
3:02:18
groupings of work that are distinct from others can form swiveling for example you can
3:02:25
have a website swim lane or an iOS development swimlin or an Android development swindling or you can have an
3:02:32
ex escalation ticket swim Lane or a project simulator you also see a lot of
3:02:38
different colors on the kanban board color coding you kanban board and
3:02:43
processes helps improve their visibility it makes it easy for people to
3:02:48
understand things in what can sometimes become a really crowded kanban board for
3:02:55
example you can use red to signify high priority escalations that need to be taken care of immediately
3:03:01
now that we know what a kanban board is let's talk about the actual kanman process
3:03:06
kanban follows a pull system this means that when the development team has
3:03:12
capacity they will pull and work into the system from the product backlog this is very different from scrum which
3:03:19
is a push system there is no owner in kanban the entire
3:03:24
team as a whole is responsible for the smooth running of the system in the real
3:03:30
world however I have seen product engineering or delivery managers take on
3:03:35
the responsibility of managing the kanban board so how does the process work
3:03:42
you have your kanban board which has the prioritized backlog on the left side as capacity becomes available people pick
3:03:49
up stuff or tasks from the backlog you'll have something called a replenishment meetings as and when more
3:03:56
things need to be added to the prioritize backlog it's similar to a backlog meeting in this meeting tasks
3:04:01
are discussed and douse clarifying you can gauge the health of your entire
3:04:08
kanban process by measuring some kanban metrics let's look at three of them
3:04:13
number one is lead time it is the total amount of time from when the team
3:04:18
commits to developing a feature to when it is released next is the cycle time this is the total
3:04:25
time that a team works on a task it tells you how long tasks take to
3:04:30
complete once they're picked up and third throughput it is the total number of tasks
3:04:36
completed during a period of time that period can be one day week month or
3:04:42
something else it has to make sense for your team it helps you gauge whether kanban is
3:04:47
working or Not by plotting the throughput on a histogram you can get the measure of the real capacity of the
3:04:54
team we makes planning easier and more accurate kanban brings in a lot of value
3:05:00
for the team it has some tremendous benefits it brings in transparency to the
3:05:06
software development by looking at the kanban board you can make out how the development is coming along it is easy
3:05:13
to understand it does not have a complicated jargon that you need to
3:05:19
first read and understand to be able to implement it you can actually implement it very
3:05:25
quickly it also offers flexibility you can customize almost everything on the
3:05:32
kanban board it also helps you reduce waste by focusing on blockers
3:05:38
continuous delivery means that you don't have to wait for something like a Sprint to be over to release it can be done as
3:05:45
and when needed once you find the right whip limit it improves the output of the entire team nobody is under stretched or
3:05:52
underutilized you also eventually end up spending less time in planning
3:05:58
meetings and more time shipping products however like any other system kanban
3:06:04
also is as good as the people running it some things you need to keep in mind
3:06:10
when while implementing kanban are number one are you able to adhere to
3:06:15
your whip limits or are you seeing it them being overridden way too often for
3:06:22
anyone to take them seriously is the kanban board maintained and is it a true
3:06:27
reflection of the current state of things does do you have executive sponsorship
3:06:34
in your company to help Carmen succeed and finally is the team taking
3:06:40
Collective ownership of the board or is it beginning to feel like it's no one's
3:06:46
responsibility so what is a product backlog in the
Product Backlog Management
3:06:52
simplest terms product backlog is a list of items that the product team needs to work on
3:06:58
the these items can be new product ideas update to existing products or fixing
3:07:04
things that are broken in the product managing a product backlog is one of the
3:07:09
hardest things you would do as a product manager it is because you're trying to do two
3:07:14
things on one side you're trying to be flexible and quick to respond to the needs of the
3:07:21
business and on the other side you're also trying to provide consistency to design and
3:07:27
development teams so who manages the backlog is the
3:07:32
product theme the product team is responsible for managing and keeping the backlog updated your team might have one
3:07:40
backlog or multiple ones the real goal of having a backlog is so that the
3:07:46
product team has a unified view of everything that needs to be done in the product
3:07:51
it is only then that the product theme can make informed decisions that are
3:07:56
consistent with the organization goals if you work for a small company which are just one product it is possible to
3:08:04
have a single product backlog however if you work for a large company with
3:08:10
multiple product lines then you will end up having multiple backlogs and each
3:08:15
backlog will be managed by a different product manager in such situations it becomes very
3:08:22
important even more important for all product managers to work collaboratively and meet regularly there are a variety
3:08:30
of people both internal and external that influence a product backlog for
3:08:36
example you might have users telling you about problems they're facing and what they like or don't like about the
3:08:41
product you might have a sales team providing you feedback on what prospects are saying customer success and support
3:08:47
teams might be reaching out to you as well the design and development team might be
3:08:53
identifying areas of improvement on their own as well and product managers might be listening to where the market is headed in general
3:09:01
as you can see there are lots of sources from where you can get input on what to
3:09:07
work on let's try out a short exercise for a minute take out a blank piece of paper
3:09:14
and write down items that you think need to be developed in the product now pass that
3:09:22
paper around the product team and tell them to continue building on that list
3:09:27
when they are done pass it to your stakeholders what will happen is you'll soon run out
3:09:34
of space in that sheet the point I'm trying to make here is
3:09:39
that there are always a ton of things that you want to do with the product but no matter how big your product and
3:09:47
Engineering teams are you will not be able to work on everything on that sheet of paper
3:09:52
and it will keep growing Beyond a single sheet you need a better process to manage this
3:09:58
list that's where a product backlog comes in it helps you do four things
3:10:04
it helps you organize the product backlog in an efficient way it provides
3:10:09
a unified view of all the potential work it provides you the ability to stand
3:10:15
crank and compare competing priorities across the organization and it gives
3:10:21
transparency to stakeholders on all the items in the product queue are all items in the product backlog
3:10:28
equal no they're not as we've spoken about this when we discuss product
3:10:33
feedback as well there is no way you can spend the same amount of time on each item in your
3:10:40
product backlog if you start doing that you will run out of hours in a day so how do you distribute your time among
3:10:47
all the ideas in the product backlog when an idea comes to the product manager in the form of a new idea update
3:10:53
they should do a summary check on it let's reinforce something that we've been talking about throughout this
3:10:59
course so let's ask some questions what is the problem is it urgent is it
3:11:05
pervasive how will the customers benefit from it and what is your proposed solution
3:11:10
there is no hard and fast rule on how much time you need to spend on each question you need to be smart in the way
3:11:18
you work at the first stage you shouldn't spend days looking at each idea try to summarize your findings in
3:11:25
one Pages this will help you focus on things that are most likely to be developed the different kinds of
3:11:31
backlogs you can have as many as you want at the end of the day it's just a list
3:11:37
whether one or more helps you get the job done is completely up to you some
3:11:42
common types of backlogs that I have seen followed the products life cycle think about it for a minute you get an
3:11:49
idea you look into it and if it makes sense to invest in it it goes to the development queue otherwise you path the
3:11:55
idea on those lines you can have the following types of product backlogs you
3:12:01
can have the idea backlog the product backlog the development backlog and the
3:12:06
ice box the idea backlog is a list of all the ideas that the product team
3:12:11
needs to look into you look at an idea from a user and business perspective and
3:12:17
stack rank them at the top will be the idea which is the most important the product team will look at the idea
3:12:24
backlog and go over the details on regular Cadence ideas will be moved to
3:12:30
the product backlog based on their importance next is your product backlog a common misconception is that
3:12:37
everything in the product backlog will be developed the product backlog is a list of things that the product theme
3:12:43
would like to work on they have done the due diligence and have come to the conclusion that working
3:12:50
on these items is important but importance is relative and the ideas
3:12:55
will keep coming the point I'm trying to make here is that you have to be smart
3:13:01
in the way you manage your time items at the top of the backlog are more flushed
3:13:07
out than those lower down they neatly broken down into epics and
3:13:12
user stories and have been discussed by the development team next up is your
3:13:17
development backlog this is the work queue for the development team they pick up the items
3:13:23
at the top of the backlog and start working on them ideas here have gone through the
3:13:28
blooming sessions and stories have been further broken down into tasks and subtasks the product team should try
3:13:35
their best to not move things around too much in the development backlog and finally there's something called an ice
3:13:42
box over over time as the product grows your backlogs will keep growing and
3:13:48
growing by now we all agree that you can't work on all of it what you will start seeing is a growing list at the
3:13:55
bottom of the backlog these are low priority item that you want to work on
3:14:02
someday but that someday has not come up in years in such a scenario some product teams
3:14:08
put these ideas in the ice box this helps them keep their product backlog
3:14:13
more presentable and manageable other teams prefer to delete these items
3:14:19
eventually you will have to ask yourself the question is your product backlog or
3:14:25
your idea backlog all your development backlog working for you
3:14:31
having a backlog and a backlog that works are two very different things building a backlog is the easy part the
3:14:38
real challenge is in keeping it current week after week product managers get so caught up in
3:14:46
what they need to do now that they're unable to spend time on their backlogs what ends up happening is that the
3:14:53
product backlog no longer represents the needs of the users and the business nobody really knows what the most
3:15:00
important thing to work on is anymore you start getting into the habit of writing the product requirements one
3:15:06
after another you stop looking at the unified view at the product backlog provides this results in a host of
3:15:13
problems different teams now are not aligned on the priorities
3:15:18
items that the dev team needs to work on are not ready on time stakeholders start to lose confidence in
3:15:25
your ability to deliver the product roadmap and customers start getting confused and
3:15:32
frustrated since they don't know when the problems are going to get solved
3:15:37
this can be avoided by doing the following number one schedule a weekly product
3:15:44
backlog meeting that all product managers attend make sure that the team is clear and
3:15:52
aligned on the product priorities and finally communicate with stakeholders
3:15:57
whenever the relative priorities of things that they care about changes so
3:16:03
how do you start working with the development team in order to convert your product backlog into your reality
3:16:08
there are a number of ways you collaborate with the larger team to make it happen let's look at some of the key
3:16:14
meetings that product managers attend The Grooming meeting is an opportunity for product managers to get together
Product Backlog Grooming/Replenishment Meeting
3:16:20
with the development team and go over the details of the upcoming projects it
3:16:26
should not be confused with the product or project kickoff the backlog meeting is more focused on specific epics and
3:16:33
user stories that need to be discussed questions are asked or marked for follow-up at a later date
3:16:40
it comprises primarily of members of the product and engineering team sometimes
3:16:46
design and data analytics folks also attend so why is it important to have a
3:16:52
grooming meeting tackling large projects can be daunting tasks even for seasoned
3:16:57
product managers the idea of incremental and manageable releases enables larger
3:17:03
projects to be tackled in an effective way product managers break down projects
3:17:09
into smaller Apex user stories and tasks they provide a great level of detail into each user's story but expecting
3:17:17
someone to just pick up the story and run with it is visual thinking I'm not
3:17:23
saying that it's not possible but it would take for teams to be working together for a very very long time to be
3:17:31
able to reach that that level of understanding in my entire career I was
3:17:36
actually able to do it with just one thing and it was amazing for every other team grooming meetings were critical
3:17:42
before writing up the user stories for an upcoming release as a product manager
3:17:48
talks to a lot of customers and stakeholders in those meetings they will go over the what the users need product
3:17:54
manager then converts the what into stories that can be worked on by the development team
3:18:00
three important points to note here there's a lot of contextual information
3:18:06
that you can't put down in the user stories it is common to miss out some
3:18:11
edge cases that are surface in these meetings technical implementation details can
3:18:17
often impact the scope of your user stories the details in the user stories are
3:18:24
often not enough hence backlog grooming meetings are an important part of the
3:18:30
process the word backlog is taken from scrum in kanban it equivalent is called
3:18:35
replenishment as in when the team is running low on user stories you need to
3:18:41
replenish it so what happens in these meetings you know the backlog meeting can be scheduled at regular intervals or
3:18:48
it can be done on an ad hoc basis as in when needed it is common for the entire Dev team to join the backlog meeting
3:18:55
designers might also join in my opinion backlog grooming meetings run smoothly
3:19:00
product managers and the engineering manager run it together before the actual grooming meeting there are a
3:19:07
number of things you need to do in order to be productive make sure to send the meeting invite much ahead of time in
3:19:13
most cases you'll end up scheduling a recurring meeting otherwise it will become very difficult to find common
3:19:21
availability for the team to meet each week the new thing in life should
3:19:26
specify the goals of the meeting and expectations from the participants ideally a day before the meeting you
3:19:33
should update the meeting invite with links of the user stories that you'd like to discuss with the team you can
3:19:40
also add links to contextual information that might be useful for them meter
3:19:45
rooms that are large enough for the team should be blocked trust me this can often become a big issue if participants
3:19:53
are joining online Link should be added to the meeting the meeting room should have a working projector or screen for
3:19:59
everyone to look at make sure that you're able to connect to the projector and also share your screen for the
3:20:07
virtual participants I can't tell you how many times I've had the entire team sitting in the room and not being able
3:20:15
to get started because of these technical issues like projector not working make sure you choose a day or
3:20:22
time where everybody is able to focus on the task at hand because these meetings
3:20:27
can get pretty heavy for example 9 am on a Monday morning might not be a good
3:20:33
time for grooming eating the points discuss above come under the basic hygiene that should
3:20:40
be followed not just for grooming meetings but for any meetings that you organize now so what happens during The
3:20:46
Grooming meeting uh you've done the part to describe above and it's time to run the actual meeting how do you go about
3:20:53
it there are some pointers you start on a light note the joke is always welcome
3:20:58
but take a call depending on the atmosphere in the room don't dive into
3:21:03
the user story straight away talk for a few minutes about the what you want to
3:21:09
do and why we want to do it when people know why they are doing and what they're
3:21:14
doing it for they always bring in the best work an engineering team that has
3:21:21
the right business context builds better products now the flow of the user
3:21:27
stories should match how users will use the product talk through each user story
3:21:32
make sure you identify the target use a Persona it is for and how they will benefit from this work
3:21:39
go over every acceptance criteria after the end of each user story ask the team
3:21:46
if they have any questions make any changes right there in each
3:21:52
user's story so that everyone in the meeting can look at what is being typed out typing out in front of the entire theme
3:21:59
can be a down thing to us it's also a time when you make the maximum number of typos but this is important
3:22:06
taking notes on the shared screen gives an opportunity for everyone to reflect on it and given their inputs always a
3:22:12
surprise with what comes out in terms of the estimation if the final estimate on
3:22:18
the story is much higher than you had expected then you will have to either
3:22:23
cut the scope of the user story so that the estimate comes down to an acceptable range
3:22:29
make some parts of the user story stretch requirements these are things that the development team should only do
3:22:37
if it has some time left after completing the important parts of the user story or you can live with the
3:22:44
estimates and work on managing the Upstream work for the release accordingly once the meeting is over
3:22:51
make sure that you do the following once you go back to your desk send any action
3:22:57
items discussed in the meeting that need to be worked on includes due dates if
3:23:04
available combine a list of important decisions that were made in the meeting and the
3:23:10
reasoning behind it these notes don't need to be as long as
3:23:15
an essay short bullet points when suffice we don't want to sitting in the
3:23:20
next grooming meeting and wondering why you did what you did in the last meeting
3:23:26
this will help you avoid such a situation from happening there are obviously some challenges with grooming
3:23:32
meetings there is a purpose behind these meetings it is to get everyone who is
3:23:37
involved in the project together to go over the requirements by doing this you avoid having multiple meetings and
3:23:44
discussing the same question again and again with different sets of people but just like any other meeting you can
3:23:51
easily run into challenges with this one as well it is very easy for these discussions to get sidetracked
3:23:59
let's say some of the common themes that are bound to come out in these backlog
3:24:04
meetings is this really what we should focus on people will ask you why this versus
3:24:11
building everything else by doing a product kickoff you can explain the data and reasoning behind
3:24:18
the focus area for the product you run into these questions very often
3:24:23
even after you've done a product kickoff people have short memories and a ton of
3:24:28
things to do so they might and they will forget the kickoff meeting from a few
3:24:34
months ago your job is to make the kickoff presentation available to everyone so that you can point to it
3:24:42
when such questions arise when you're going over user stories you're bound to hit uncovered scenarios you've not
3:24:49
thought of and it's okay while the goals of the grooming meeting is to do exactly that the scenarios
3:24:58
might be something that's important that you've missed in this case make a note of it
3:25:04
and bring it back to the team in the next meeting or it could be in Edge case that's not worth investing into
3:25:10
in this case document that the team discussed it and decided it was not a
3:25:17
priority and finally my favorite one why can't we add a next feature it is easy
3:25:23
for the backlog meaning to become an idea session and it is the product manager's job to keep everything on
3:25:30
track questions will come up as to why can't we add a particular feature to
3:25:35
release this feature might fall into the following buckets it needs to be done
3:25:40
the feature was missed and needs to be prioritized and you should nice to have it's a good idea that
3:25:47
should be explored further for future release but not right now won't do it does not
3:25:55
make sense for us to do this feature at all even with all this I found that the
3:26:01
grooming meetings can be extremely helpful for a smooth development and release cycle it gets everyone on the
3:26:08
same page on what is expected at the end of each iteration the times when I
3:26:15
skipped The Grooming step and put this tools right in the dev queue I have always run into issues
3:26:22
these meetings can sometimes seems like a huge train on resources
3:26:28
because of its frequency and the number of people involved but it will save you
3:26:35
a lot of time and effort in the grander scheme of things we've managed to cover a lot of great
3:26:42
things till now a few more topics and we'll be done with the first section of our course
3:26:50
so let's get to it the next meeting we want to discuss is the daily stand-up meeting if you've
Daily Standup Meeting
3:26:57
mentioned it before a few times but now we'll look at it more closely so what's
3:27:03
a stand-up a stand-up is a session for people working together to briefly
3:27:10
discuss the progress that has been made on the project the idea is that the meeting is short
3:27:18
and focuses only on important issues so everyone can just stand for the course
3:27:25
of the meeting without getting too tired one of the most common standups is the
3:27:31
daily stand-up conducted by the engineering team the goal of this daily stand-up is to do a quick check-in to
3:27:37
make sure that the development is progressing as planned team members are
3:27:43
getting the right support to excel in their work and to identify potential issues that
3:27:51
need immediate attention there are two types of stand-ups that you can choose
3:27:57
from the first one is called round robin in this type of stand up everybody
3:28:03
answers the following three questions what did you do yesterday what are you
3:28:09
going to do today and are there any blockers that you need to discuss you're not expected to speak for a long time
3:28:16
each member takes less than a minute to answer these questions for their work
3:28:22
the goal of these questions is threefold one is to standardize the information
3:28:28
expected from everyone the second is to keep it short and
3:28:33
concise and third is to surface any issues as they come
3:28:39
if you have a blocker that needs a deep dive you will parking lot the issue this
3:28:44
means that a smaller group of people will meet after the stand up to unblock
3:28:49
you if the issue still persists even after the parking lot meeting a
3:28:55
larger meeting is called to Deep dive into the issue in the meantime you can start working on
3:29:01
something else and keep the team efficient the second type of stand up is walk the
3:29:08
board this one means walking across the physical or digital board
3:29:13
as a team anyone from the team can do it a great way is to get different members
3:29:19
of the team to lead the exercise every day it is an organic way of getting
3:29:25
everybody in the team to understand the entire project the goal of these meetings is the same
3:29:33
big difference though lies and how they achieve it for example round robin
3:29:38
focuses on individuals and supporting them to complete their tasks on the
3:29:45
other hand walk the board focuses on how the project is doing as a whole and
3:29:52
removing blockers that exist I would recommend round robin if the team is
3:29:58
inexperienced and walk the boat if the majority of this team is experienced so what are
3:30:06
some of the key characteristics of a stand-up number one it is time bound standups
3:30:12
work because they're scheduled for a fixed amount of time usually five or ten minutes depending on the size of the
3:30:19
team the idea behind keeping its shot is to make sure everybody shares only
3:30:25
what's needed number two frequency you need to maintain a regular Cadence
3:30:32
for your stand up you can have the daily or weekly stand up depending on the needs of your team
3:30:38
two things you need to keep in mind while deciding the frequency of your stand up one it
3:30:46
should be often enough so that people are not left blocked for a long time
3:30:52
and second it should not be so often that it feels like a complete waste of
3:30:59
time you don't have to have a daily stand up if that works for your team better
3:31:05
number two location the location of the meeting should be accessible to everyone
3:31:11
this might sound like an obvious thing but sometimes it's not
3:31:17
I've been in a situation where I had to run for one building to another to
3:31:23
attend a stand-up always wondering why location of the stand up should check
3:31:30
the following boxes everyone should be able to reach the location without too much effort it
3:31:36
should be big enough so that the team can stand around in a circle I've been
3:31:42
in stand-ups held in rooms where half the team was standing outside the door trying not to end up in this situation
3:31:49
it should be in a place where it there isn't too much noise and people can hear
3:31:54
what everybody else is saying your stand up shouldn't disturb everyone else
3:31:59
around they probably have their own stand-ups to take care of number three is agenda stand-up agendas
3:32:07
should remain constant as much as possible you can tweak it after a period
3:32:13
of time based on whether it's working for the team or not but not something that should be changed every day or
3:32:20
every week the agenda should revolve answering three questions what did you
3:32:25
do yesterday plan for today any blockers if you stand up follows Walk The Board
3:32:32
model then your agenda is to identify project blockers
3:32:37
next is participation everybody who's been invited to stand up should attend if you're not able to attend then you
3:32:44
should send your update to the team before the stand up a big fan of official invites to stand
3:32:52
up but sometimes is the only way to juggle multiple meetings next comes up
3:32:59
documentation standups are not documentation heavy that's great however
3:33:04
you do need to keep track of blockers that surface in them many stores the right people get together to solve the
3:33:11
issues after the stand up keep track of any action items that come up after
3:33:16
these meetings so that they don't fall between the tracks and finally the size of the stand up the
3:33:24
size of the standup should not be more than 10 people otherwise it will become really long and cumbersome like a
3:33:30
regular meeting but what do you do if you have a large team in that case try and break the team
3:33:37
into smaller logical groups that can work independently and can have separate
3:33:43
standups the engineering manager the scrum master or the product manager can
3:33:48
be the common link and crack the project as a whole the concept of stand up sounds great in
3:33:56
theory but in the real world you'll often find yourself at Crossroads between the concept and its practical
3:34:03
implementation let's look at some of the issues that are bound to come up
3:34:09
sometimes people might be stuck on one ticket and might be really frustrated all they want to do is to share their
3:34:17
issue in the stand up so so chances are that you stand up the next day is going
3:34:22
to become an actual life problem solving session which is not the goal stand up is to surface the problem not for
3:34:30
finding out the solution that's a different meeting with long projects that might run into one standups can
3:34:37
become a bit monotonous people might stop taking it seriously
3:34:42
some people might use the stand up as a platform to discuss unrelated issues
3:34:48
before you know it a one-time exception becomes the rule
3:34:54
each team has people with different personalities some people might feel too shy or
3:35:01
overwhelmed to speak freely in a group setting hence they might continue to struggle
3:35:06
with blockers and take longer to complete their tasks I hope you'll be able to work together
3:35:13
with your team to overcome these issues because none of these are insurmountable
Retrospective Meeting
3:35:21
retrospective means looking back it's time to contemplate on what has happened in software engineering Sprint
3:35:29
retrospective storms an integral part of software development process its Origins
3:35:34
can actually be traced back to the principles of the agile Manifesto which states the following
3:35:40
at regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective than
3:35:46
tunes and adjust Its Behavior accordingly so what is a Sprint
3:35:51
retrospective meeting a Sprint retrospective meeting is an opportunity for the team to come together and
3:35:58
reflect on what has happened in the past few weeks it helps assess the overall health of the team and figure out how
3:36:06
well it's been working together as a cohesive unit the goal is to get a better understanding of the following
3:36:12
questions number one what went well you look at how you did working on your
3:36:19
tasks individually and with other teammates what did you like about this experience for example
3:36:25
did you get stuck somewhere and was the teammate able to help you get unstuck
3:36:30
again and complete your work on time number two what didn't go well was there
3:36:37
anything that happened during this print that made your life difficult for example did the requirements change
3:36:43
while you were working on the ticket or was the information on the ticket not complete were you blocked because you
3:36:49
were waiting for someone to complete something else number three how can you improve is there any way we can improve
3:36:56
and fix the things that didn't go well for example should the tickets be broken down into smaller chunks is the back end
3:37:03
and the front-end tickets being worked on by different people should they work together so that one is not left waiting
3:37:10
for the other to complete the work overall you will realize that it's not always as simple as putting the
3:37:18
questions together and looking at the answers Gathering feedback is actually an art you have to be aware of the
3:37:25
internal dynamics of the team for example some people might be shy in a group setting you might need some
3:37:32
icebreakers to get them comfortable enough to share the views group thinking might overwrite common sense and there
3:37:40
might be some strong voices in the group that dominate the conversation and
3:37:46
discourage everyone to share their opinion there are different formats that you can
3:37:51
use for Sprint retrospectives we wrote A Blog on 23 different formats you can
3:37:57
check it out in the link in description they actually help you discover what people really want and bring out a
3:38:03
positive change you can try all of them or some of them see which one works better for your team and stick to it so
3:38:11
why are Sprint retrospective important we've spoken a little about it but let's dig a little bit deeper it is only when
3:38:18
you learn from the past that you can improve in the future otherwise you'll make no progress incremental
3:38:24
improvements based on what you learn through your experience leads to measurable outcomes there are four
3:38:31
benefits of the Sprint retrospective meeting number one is transparency reviewing with the team how things are
3:38:37
going goes a long way in making the team more effective when everyone is a part of the process and their voices are
3:38:43
heard they're more responsive to change everything that happens in the Sprint retrospective is discussed in front of
3:38:51
the entire Team all the takeaways all the action items are tracked and are accessible to everyone number two is
3:38:58
teamwork the team decides together which items need to be fixed first this helps
3:39:04
build a culture of teamwork where everyone is working together to improve the process you get to hear different
3:39:09
points of views of your teammates and how they perceive similar things in the long run it will help you get a better
3:39:16
understanding of what their personalities are like and help you maintain a healthy working relationship
3:39:22
with them which helps the team number three is trust the Sprint retrospective
3:39:27
focuses on the process not the person a Sprint retrospective is successful
3:39:34
because everyone feels safe to share the views they believe that their views
3:39:40
however contrary will not be held against them and find finally actually the goal of the spring retrospective
3:39:47
meeting is to bring about incremental change in order to do this action items
3:39:52
are listed ownership of the action items is identified and delivery dates are put
3:39:57
on them so that things don't fall between the tracks the views shared by everyone
3:40:04
might vastly differ but over time what we'll see is themes will emerge for
3:40:09
example if we constantly keep hearing about requirements getting changed then you have a problem that needs to be
3:40:15
fixed so who participates in a Sprint retrospective meeting there are obviously the regulars your product
3:40:20
manager engineering managers Club Masters developers qas devops software
3:40:25
Architects everybody who had worked on the product update besides the regular Sprint retrospective often have guest
3:40:32
appearances it could be anyone from the company who's invested in the project designers
3:40:38
data analysts and marketing managers they are able to provide a unique
3:40:43
perspective to the team who runs the Sprint retrospective the product manager and the engineering
3:40:50
manager often run the Retro meetings once the team has settled into a
3:40:55
comfortable Cadence and is familiar on how to run them the patron of leading
3:41:01
the Sprint retro can be passed to different people in the team there are a number of advantages of
3:41:06
doing that it gets people more comfortable and they start becoming more active in the group setting once you
3:41:12
lead one of these session you tend to be more invested in its success so what happens in a Sprint
3:41:18
retrospective meetings the team gets together on a regular Cadence to discuss how things are going it's a good idea to
3:41:24
start a retro with nice bigger question especially if the team is new and uh the members don't know each other that well
3:41:31
it if it helps everyone to feel a little bit more comfortable this is followed by
3:41:37
each member answering all the questions we discussed earlier what went well what
3:41:42
didn't go well how can we improve this is an individual exercise where they take some time to jot down their answers
3:41:50
the second part of it is that all the answers are collected the group looks together at all the answers as a team
3:41:57
you might see certain common things emerge and similar answers are grouped
3:42:03
together the third part of the Sprint retrospective meeting is voting
3:42:09
the team needs to figure out which items need to be tackled first this is this
3:42:15
this is done through voting which is the quantitative exercise the items with the
3:42:20
most number of votes get to be worked on first you also have a qualitative discussion about all these items to
3:42:26
figure out what the team really needs to work on and finally action items are
3:42:31
assigned with due dates and tracked for completion how often do you need to ask
3:42:37
in retrospective meetings uh there is no right or wrong answers for
3:42:42
this each team needs to find out what works for them it is common for teams to meet at the end of each print but if
3:42:49
you're a company which has very very short spins then it might not be a good idea start with a frequency which you
3:42:58
think will work over time you'll be able to figure out if it's too much or too less two possible scenarios might occur
3:43:05
number one your team meets and struggles to go through all the topic in the given amount of time one of the reasons could
3:43:11
be that a lot of things pile up because you're not meeting often enough in this scenario increase your frequency of
3:43:18
meeting the second scenario is you your teammates and you don't have enough things to discuss in this in this case
3:43:25
reduce the frequency of your meeting what are some of the common uh types of
3:43:30
Sprint retrospective meetings there are a lot of different types of retrospective meetings the goal is the
3:43:36
same to find out how the team can improve some of the common ones are 4L
3:43:41
sales vote match that glad one word retro speed car starfish calm ducky
3:43:48
Three Little Pigs original four lean coffee I can go on and on WE identified
3:43:54
23 different formats that you can look at and figure out
3:43:59
which one works best for your team the final thing you want to discuss is is the Sprint retrospective working for you
3:44:06
have you ever heard the phrase needing to discuss another meaning might sounds
3:44:11
like a waste of time but it's important to find out whether the Retro is working for you or not it does not mean that the
3:44:19
entire team or group needs to meet a few members can get together to find out the answers to the following question to
3:44:26
gauge whether the retrospective is effective or not is everyone participating in the meeting are some
3:44:33
people louder than the others and dominating discussion are action items being completed or are they just piling
3:44:40
up what is the body language of each team member look like during these meetings
3:44:45
do they look or sound excited bored indifferent
3:44:51
does it seem like the meeting is dragging forever and doesn't seem to end we feel like the atmosphere in the
3:44:58
meeting allows everybody to give their honest feedback without fear of Retribution you have to get both the
3:45:05
qualitative and quantitative feedback from the team when looking for these answers it doesn't have to be formal
3:45:10
server you can just go and talk to people and find out what they're thinking do this at regular intervals
3:45:16
think of it as a retro for your retro doing retro for your retro meetings will
3:45:22
help you improve it and make it more effective in the long term
3:45:28
once you've gone through the development process you'll be ready to release or launch a product when you release a
3:45:35
product you either make it available to everyone or to a smaller subset depending on the kind of product and the
3:45:42
target users you're more likely to end up doing either of the two let's take a
3:45:48
closer look at the different types of testing you'd end up doing before the final product release so what is testing
3:45:55
testing is trying out something different to see if it works in software
3:46:01
development testing take center stage and plays an important role in Building
3:46:06
user-driven Products if you think about it there are three ways to test your
3:46:12
software testing the quality of the product with the help of the quality assurance team
3:46:17
before it is released to users the goal of this type of testing is to
3:46:23
find the product works as for the acceptance criteria requirements all
3:46:29
companies do the self testing the amount of time they spend on it varies a lot
3:46:34
the second type of testing is testing of product by external users
3:46:39
the goal of this type of testing is to make sure that the user experience when
3:46:45
you release it out is as what you'd expect the reason a lot of companies do
3:46:50
it is because it is impossible to take care of all the different kinds of use
3:46:56
cases edge cases that people might encounter letting your users test out
3:47:01
your product help to surface more issues that need to be fixed
3:47:06
and third type of test day is to find out if the update or the change in the
3:47:12
product provides the expected results both the type of testing that we
3:47:18
discussed before this are acceptance testing and a similar in some sense
A/B Testing for Product Managers
3:47:24
now this testing is a b testing and has a completely different object let's talk
3:47:30
a bit more about a b testing an A B test consists of three parts
3:47:36
a this is what the current state of your product is B this is the state of the
3:47:43
product after the release and the test measuring the impact of the
3:47:49
change is also forms your hypothesis so what do you need a b testing for
3:47:56
company spend a lot of time in resources building new capabilities and making big
3:48:01
changes to the products th is great but change was impact cannot
3:48:07
be measured is meaningless there are reasons why sudden massive
3:48:12
changes are not good number one big changes requires a lot of
3:48:19
resources you have finite number of resources spending them all on one big
3:48:24
update can lead to other areas of the product getting neglected number two
3:48:30
larger updates are riskier when you make a lot of changes to your code the risk
3:48:35
of something not working is much higher big changes take time
3:48:41
customers today both B2B and b2c expect companies to evolve every day if you do
3:48:49
not improve your user experience on a regular Cadence you run the risk of becoming obsolete
3:48:55
larger updates require more testing and is an additional trade on time and
3:49:02
resources hard to measure when you release a big update it's hard
3:49:07
to figure out the contribution of each part of the change on a total impact larger updates have more than one moving
3:49:15
part and therefore become hard to measure foreign
3:49:21
product manages to accurately measure the impact
3:49:26
through small incremental changes so let's look at the key parts of an A B
3:49:32
test the first is goals and motivation what is your driver for conducting an A
3:49:40
B test your primary focus could be improving your user experience or
3:49:45
branding revenues making it clear in the AP test helps align the team towards the
3:49:52
goal your hypothesis you cannot run maybe test without forming and stating your hypothesis your hypothesis should
3:49:59
be crisp and to the point it should not run in true number of pages you should
3:50:05
use the following format by making X we expect y change
3:50:12
next is your test groups an aiding test has two groups the control group where
3:50:19
an A B test begins users in this group do not see any change they continue to
3:50:26
use the product in its original Avatar the second is the variant group users in
3:50:33
this group see the product in its new updated version next is randomization
3:50:38
users should be put in control of variable group at random without any
3:50:44
specific rule this enables the experiment to run without bias being induced or to agree that can skew the
3:50:51
results next is traffic split as part of the experiment you need to specify how the
3:50:58
graphic needs to be split between the control and the variant you also need to
3:51:04
specify the duration of your AV experiment the start and the end date
3:51:10
you should keep seasonality in mind when you decide to run your experiment where
3:51:16
it is in most cases you'll have a control group and a value times you
3:51:21
might want to test more than one period in such cases you can do an A B C test
3:51:27
where B and C are two varians to find out the winner
3:51:32
next is platform and devices users behave differently across platforms and
3:51:38
devices so you'll have to learn different tests for each type to prove your hypothesis
3:51:43
what works for desktop might not work for mobile what works for iOS might not
3:51:49
work for Android you cannot extrapolate the results of one platform to say that
3:51:56
it works on the others next is statistical significance Survey Monkey
3:52:01
explains it really well according to them in the context of a b testing
3:52:09
statistical significance is How likely it is that the difference between your
3:52:16
experiments control version and the test version is it due to an
3:52:22
error or random chance and last metrics track it is important to not confuse this with impact these
3:52:30
are midways that you track for your product on a regular basis your a b experiment should not hurt other
3:52:38
important metrics at the cost of increasing the impact of the experiment
3:52:43
so the question is how do you set up a Navy test you start off with writing a
3:52:48
test proposal clearly describe each part mentioned in the above sections ask
3:52:55
yourself the following what do you want to improve on your side how would you quantify the Improvement
3:53:02
and is the change worth the effort get stakeholder buying
3:53:09
you have to get everyone on the same page that running the A B test is
3:53:14
important set up some time with all the key stakeholders to go over your test proposal listen to this feedback and
3:53:22
update the test will it make sense next is to crack your progress
3:53:28
you should check how your A B test is performing at least once a week with key
3:53:33
stakeholders at the end of the test make sure you communicate the final results and the
3:53:39
next steps sometimes you might have so many deaths running at once that it's easy to do
3:53:46
stack of these changes now that you know everything about AV testing what the question is how do you
3:53:52
actually go about setting one after a product don't worry you don't have to
3:53:58
build the entire a b testing functionality from scratch there's some great tools out there that you can use
3:54:04
on most out of the box you can use optimizely Google optimize Survey Monkey
3:54:10
unbounce or lots of other tools out there depending on the use case one tool
3:54:16
might fit better than the other why a b testing is a great framework
3:54:21
there are definitely some challenges that you will come across let's look at some of them
3:54:26
statistically significant results require a good amount of traffic on the site
3:54:32
and users if you don't have volume then you will not be able to run you'll be
3:54:38
tests for measuring impact you'll have to find something else test duration if you have lower volume
3:54:44
of users in a test Pro then you'll have to really run the test for a longer amount of time this means you have to
3:54:52
wait longer to find out if all the users will benefit from the change also if the
3:54:59
tests last for too long it runs the risk of adding new variables like seasonality
3:55:05
which will tell you to research and finally the number of tests if you
3:55:11
run more than a few tests at one point of time you run out of traffic in such cases your update might be ready but you
3:55:19
might not be able to release it as a result your users will have to wait longer to benefit from the change
3:55:27
so does it make sense for everyone to do an A B test not necessary at the end of
3:55:33
the day you have to be the pros and cons for some people doing a b testing might not be practically possible often teams
3:55:41
develop bad habits of testing without purpose try to keep it in check create a
3:55:47
centralized test approval and launch Team yes I mean centralized in this
3:55:53
scenario it really does help it provides a unified view of all the tests running
3:55:58
in the company and new test that different themes want to run up next we have beta testing beta
Beta Testing for Product Managers
3:56:07
testing is when your customers or external users try out your update before it becomes generally available to
3:56:13
everyone the goal of beta testing is to give feedback on how your product performs in
3:56:19
the real world early on in my career I used to wonder what was the point of these tests
3:56:25
student Alpha test created by your quality assurance team be enough to make sure the product works as expected
3:56:33
after all these are professionals who've been trained to test your software how is the end user going to test your
3:56:40
software better than them actually that is the wrong way to look at things your in-house QA team will
3:56:47
build a ton of manual and automated test cases and test the robustness of the
3:56:53
update on top of that each user will have a different hardware and software
3:56:58
configuration it is impossible to account and recreate all of them with
3:57:04
Alpha Testing that is where beta testing comes in there are two types of beta tests you
3:57:12
can either do a public open Beta Testing as the name suggests this type of testing is available to the public
3:57:18
anyone who has access to a product can go ahead and start using and testing out the features the advantages here are
3:57:26
that it's easier for users to try out the update you will get feedback from more number
3:57:32
of users and it is also a great way to Garner interest in the product and get
3:57:38
traffic on the site however there are some challenges here you don't know how many users will
3:57:46
actually end up using the beta so planning and managing it can be a bit
3:57:51
chaotic at times open betas are also extremely difficult to control for example you might have a
3:57:59
set of expectations on how you want the release to be used
3:58:05
oftentimes a open Beta makes more sense for a b2c product when you're starting a
3:58:11
new line of service or adding new capabilities second type of beta testing is closed
3:58:18
beta testing this is the traditional way of doing beta test it is open to smaller subset of users
3:58:26
you are more in control or at least you think you identify users who will be
3:58:32
ideal for the test and work with them closely to identify issues in the
3:58:37
product you collect all this great feedback and then prioritize the ones that need to be
3:58:42
fixed before the general lease so you've decided to run a beta test or program for an upcoming release so how are you
3:58:49
going to set it up there are a few things you need to keep in mind number one is
3:58:54
establish goals for the beta test this is the first step that you need to take when setting up the test
3:59:02
this is also the step that most people skip the goal of your test should be
3:59:07
clear to everyone both internal and external stakeholders you'd think that all beta tests would
3:59:13
have the same goal that is true to some extent through the beta test you want to check how robust your release is
3:59:20
whether it matches up to the quality standards set by a team the difference in each beta test goal lies in what it
3:59:29
does not want to achieve you can use a beta to unearth and fix every possible
3:59:35
bug or usability issues but where do you draw the line and say that you're only only going to fix X
3:59:42
number of things or why types of problem stating them as part of your goal helps
3:59:48
prevent confusion and Chaos during the actual beta test number two identify participants
3:59:56
you can select your users based on a number of factors like skill sets
4:00:01
if a feature requires a certain type of skill set then only users who have them should be added to the beta test if
4:00:08
users are not well equipped to use the beta they might not be able to take full
4:00:14
advantage of the update it could lead to user dissatisfaction and frustration
4:00:20
number two is time commitment the users should be able to spend a decent amount
4:00:26
of time testing the feature on a regular basis to provide feedback
4:00:31
next is accessibility users should be able to access the update without any
4:00:38
roadblocks this means for example if the beta test requires an advanced technical setup
4:00:45
then either the user should be able to do it themselves or you are able to provide them the
4:00:51
support to set it up and finally the commitment it comes down to how committed and excited users are
4:00:58
to try out and help the test next is creating documentation it's extremely
4:01:04
important for your beta test to have good documentation when creating
4:01:10
documentation you should be specific documentation should not sound like a
4:01:15
novel it should be specific to the change being introduced what's in it how
4:01:21
to use it and provide feedback it should have the right medium when we say documentation the format doesn't need to
4:01:27
be a word doc per se some people learn better by reading others by watching videos while rest
4:01:35
like life walk through sessions so make sure the medium you choose works for
4:01:40
your users and finally the naming convention you will have a name for your product during
4:01:46
the internal release which is different from your beta or launch be consistent
4:01:52
in how you refer to the product while talking to your customers and while writing your documentation
4:01:59
the feedback process now the goal of the beta is to get
4:02:04
feedback on the change that you want to introduce the feedback process is the most
4:02:10
critical part of this test creating a process that works for all the users is
4:02:16
an iterative approach you start with what you think is right and base your interactions with the customers you
4:02:23
tweak it along the way you can either come up with a template for users to provide the feedback or let them write
4:02:30
what they feel in a free form text field here's an example template that you
4:02:36
could use you could ask them generally there's the name email the company name
4:02:41
and questions around what is the behavior they're actually seeing and how
4:02:47
do they actually expect it to work you can go ahead and automate the name email
4:02:53
and Company most likely those that information can come directly from your database
4:03:00
once you know what information you need it's time to find the best medium for providing feedback some people like live
4:03:06
sessions where users can share their experience of working through the beta the great thing about these sessions is
4:03:12
that they are interactive and all users get a chance to hear about everybody else's experience but not everybody might be comfortable
4:03:19
with sharing on a in a group setting our users might get biased based on what
4:03:25
they have from everybody else there are ways to counter these issues though you can collect feedback before
4:03:31
the meeting to get a complete picture you could do one-on-one sessions as well talking to each beta participant after
4:03:38
each Milestone is the most comprehensive way of collecting feedback it provides
4:03:43
you an understanding of the underlying context behind the feedback and helps
4:03:48
you get to the root cause of the problem faster foreign feedback which is extremely popular
4:03:56
you can add a feedback link to the product to make it easier for users to send
4:04:02
the feedback as and when they're trying out the product you could also use feedback portals if
4:04:08
your company uses a feedback portal to get feedback from users on a regular basis you can use it for the beta test
4:04:15
as well now what kind of metrics would you track in your beta test some common ones that
4:04:22
I have seen is the total number of users have signed up for the beta number of active beta users
4:04:28
you will have to Define what constitutes an active user total feedback provided
4:04:33
to actionable feedback provided and total feedback implemented for General
4:04:38
availability over time these metrics will help you decide if beta testing is
4:04:43
working for you Beyond these metrics there are number of subjective questions you should discuss
4:04:49
with your team after the beta is complete like how confident does the team feel
4:04:55
about the public release after the beta do you need to do another set of beta
4:05:00
testing after the current feedback has been implemented in some cases you might go ahead and release the product of the
4:05:07
beta however in most cases there'll be some amount of work that will need to be done before the update is ready for
4:05:15
release it's always good to share the outcome of every beta with the intern stakeholders
4:05:21
and beta participants in addition you should thank all the participants for the time and effort they put into the
4:05:28
test if a specific feedback is going to be worked on then it is good to share that
4:05:34
as well all in all there are several advantages of beta tests you're able to get
4:05:41
feedback on the product from real users edge cases that you've never thought
4:05:47
come up in beta testing it is better to find lots of issues in the beta versus when you make it
4:05:54
publicly available you have more control on the product in a beta versus once it becomes generally available
4:06:01
beta tests also reduce the risk of causing issues for customers it is
4:06:06
because people using beta are aware that the system might not be stable hence
4:06:11
they use the beta only with test data and they never hook up the beta with the
4:06:17
production database and finally the beta will help you improve the quality of the final release
4:06:25
but like everything else there's some challenges with data racing as well one of the biggest is it's not always
4:06:32
easy to find good beta testers you have to identify users you have to build a rapper and relationship with them only
4:06:39
then can you convince them of the symbiotic nature of data testing
4:06:45
it does add a lot of overhead for your product and development team running beta tests might stretch the theme too
4:06:53
thin it slows down releases you have to balance the need to move fast and break
4:06:58
things versus slowing down to achieve a certain level of quality after hearing all this
4:07:05
you might be confused what you should do when you are the product manager
4:07:11
well you have to look holistically and you have to ask yourself the following questions what is the relative gain in the quality
4:07:19
that I get by doing beta tests do I have the resources to run these tests are there other types of testing that are
4:07:26
less resource intensive which can get the job done can I justify the delay in release for
4:07:33
more comprehensive testing at the end of the day your answer will be unique to
4:07:39
your business it might make complete sense for you to
4:07:44
do beta testing or you might be like um wait a minute this is great but I don't
4:07:52
think we need this right now your product is now out there in front
Data Driven Product Management
4:07:59
of users either as an MVP or a full-fledged release you will be
4:08:04
measuring certain product metrics to find that out even though we're just starting to talk about it now does not
4:08:11
mean that you talk about your product metrics after releasing the product
4:08:17
if you do that then God help you what you want to measure to gauge the success
4:08:23
of your product is something that you work on very early on usually when you're prioritizing this
4:08:30
work against all the other things that can be built before we look at the actual product
4:08:36
metrics let's take a step back and look at how you can become a data driven
4:08:42
product manager product management teams that use data to drive the decision making are more
4:08:48
successful than those who rely only on the gut you will never have all the data
4:08:54
you need but asking the right questions helps move the culture of the
4:08:59
organization in the right direction in larger companies you might have an analytics team that you can rely on but
4:09:07
if you work for a small company chances are that as a product manager you will
4:09:13
have to find and analyze the data it can be a daunting task if it's the first
4:09:18
time you're doing this but it's worth it in the end the following five steps will help you
4:09:25
do that step one start with questions start asking the
4:09:31
right questions this will give you a good understanding of the current state of data in your organization for example
4:09:38
what do we want to measure and why what data do we collect now is the data
4:09:46
we collect today useful how is the data used to drive business
4:09:51
decisions who uses this data how easy is it to
4:09:56
collect the data how do people access the data today in what form talk to the
4:10:02
different teams in your company to find the answers to these questions they will help you get a better graph on the scope
4:10:09
of work required into becoming not just a data admin product manager but as a
4:10:14
data driven product team and organization then treat it like a product prioritizing what's most
4:10:20
important and start working on it first once you've answered the above questions
4:10:26
you've completed the first step in that Journey step two Define key product metrics
4:10:33
these are metrics that help you track the success of your products they can be further broken down into different areas
4:10:40
depending on what the focus of the company is at that time metrics should be easy to understand and
4:10:49
be able to tell you the how the product is performing your organization will
4:10:54
want to focus on different things at various stages of its Evolution it is
4:11:00
important that the product team aligns with the business goals of the organization otherwise you will end up
4:11:07
wasting your time and energy on things that are not important step 3 find the right data this is one
4:11:16
of the most time consuming paths how do you find the right data again start with questions and chip away one by one it
4:11:25
will make things clearer for example what data do we need to track
4:11:31
is the data already tracked somewhere most organization track a lot of things
4:11:37
sometimes too many things in the long run developing a data
4:11:43
strategy for the entire organization helps reduce redundancies how to attract
4:11:49
the data that is missing if none of the data points or only some of them are being calculated then you'll have to do
4:11:56
some heavy lifting in more situation your company will be applying either of the two strategies to track your data
4:12:03
they will either be using custom tracking events that development team writes or they'll be using an
4:12:09
application or interface where the users can themselves set up event tracking
4:12:15
we'll have to work closely with the development team to get the Data Tracking set up and then convert the raw
4:12:21
data into key metrics step 4 communicate the product metrics
4:12:27
you might be collecting and Reporting metrics and think it's great no one
4:12:33
might be looking at it or even worse people might not even know the metrics
4:12:38
exist yes this is a real possibility in any company even after you send out that
4:12:44
email announced it over slack and communicated to people in person for example in a password I used to
4:12:52
update product metrics on a weekly basis but never got any questions from anyone
4:12:59
after a few weeks I started to wonder if something was wrong and it was turned
4:13:04
out that no one was actually looking at my reports because it was yet another application
4:13:11
they needed to sign in surprise surprise lesson learned choose a medium to
4:13:16
communicate that doesn't add an overhead for others to access
4:13:22
how do you communicate will vary in each company you will have to develop it in consultation with your stakeholders
4:13:29
find out what they will be most comfortably using except with different mediums the
4:13:35
spec is the structure of your communication itself it has to cater to
4:13:41
different types of stakeholders some people only want to know the metric others like to dig bit deeper
4:13:49
ideally you should report the following the value of the metric for the current
4:13:55
period the expected Target value
4:14:00
if there has been a deviation then explain the possible reasons for it
4:14:06
State any follow-up actions that will be taken make sure to add the definition of the
4:14:13
metric you might have had a big meeting months ago where everybody worked together to come up with a definition
4:14:19
for the metric but guess what people forget
4:14:24
so it's critical to State exactly what the metric stands for in each
4:14:29
communication please also State the assumptions you've
4:14:34
made to derive the metric and finally add links to all your data
4:14:40
sources and how people can log into them as well as who to contact in case anyone
4:14:46
has further questions step 5 automate the process you want to
4:14:52
build a data strategy for your product theme that can scale in the beginning you'll have to do everything manually
4:14:59
whether it's collecting data from different sources stitching it together and finally sending it out gradually you
4:15:07
can automate the process start with things that are transaction and easy to automate find that right balance some
4:15:14
things might not be worth automating because of the investment required
4:15:20
as the needs of the business evolve the key metrics you track will also change you should have regular feedback
4:15:27
sessions with the stakeholders to improve the process it is important to collect and analyze data using ways that
4:15:35
make it easily extendable this way you don't have to start from scratch every time something new needs
4:15:43
to be added and tracked and analyzed once you have the right data Foundation
Product Management Metrics
4:15:48
it's all about measuring and analyzing the right metrics for your products product managers encounter a lot of
4:15:55
different data and metrics in the work sometimes it's just really tough to keep
4:16:00
track of what every metric means the goal here is not to tell you to start
4:16:06
measuring 30 metrics for every product yes that's the total number of metrics
4:16:11
you're going to learn about today the goal is actually to make you aware of what different product managers all over
4:16:17
the world are measuring for the products apps and website ask yourself the following questions
4:16:23
before reading further what are the goals of my organization and what are the goals of my product team it's only
4:16:30
when you have a clear understanding of what your North Star is that you can figure out how to crack the results of
4:16:37
your effort otherwise you'll start collecting things that don't matter to the business
4:16:43
you will definitely cross paths with a lot of these metrics in your careers so let's look at all of these metrics one
4:16:49
by one children read the total people who stop using a product after a period of times
4:16:55
are the ones who have churned let's look at the formula for churn rate in the
4:17:00
numerator you have the difference of the people at the beginning of a time period
4:17:05
and the people at the end of the time period you divide it by the total number
4:17:11
at the beginning of the time periods that will give you the churn rate churn
4:17:16
rate is one of the most critical metrics to gauge for B2B SAS products it's
4:17:23
actually pretty easy to measure churn the challenge is what do you do with it what is a good time period for measuring
4:17:30
the churn rate should you measure it daily weekly monthly or or annually that
4:17:35
depends on your sales cycle and is all shown equal not really losing customers with a low
4:17:43
lifetime value has a different Impact versus losing customers with a high lifetime value
4:17:50
but then you have to factor in a possibility that the customer might
4:17:55
start with the low LTV before progressing to a higher TV think about all these things while calculate churn
4:18:02
acceptable values and actions to improve the churn will be unique to your company
4:18:07
and your customers retention rate this is basically the inverse of churn
4:18:14
the people who stay with you for a time period are the ones you have retained
4:18:21
the formula is as follows numerator is the difference of the total
4:18:27
number at the end of the speed time period and the total number at the beginning
4:18:32
in the denominator you have the total number at the beginning of the time period
4:18:38
retention rates are most valuable when calculating across a grouping of cohorts
4:18:46
of customers sharing the same attributes over a fixed period of time customer lifetime value the value of a customer
4:18:53
throughout their engagement with your product is their clv this is the amount
4:19:00
of money you will earn from the customer till the time they stop using your product
4:19:05
the formula for clv is as follows you multiply the average life of customer
4:19:11
with the value of your customer you can increase clb by either increasing the
4:19:16
average life of the customer or their value a customer will say longer with your
4:19:22
company if you understand the problems you proactively work to fix them you
4:19:27
provide excellent support and you have great user experience you can increase the value of a customer
4:19:34
by also upselling higher tiered products cross-selling other services as well as
4:19:42
driving reference through them net promoter score Fred R and Dean came
4:19:48
up with the concept of NPS after studying how certain questions correlate
4:19:54
to customer Behavior one question really stood out well what is the likelihood that you would
4:20:02
recommend customer X to a friend or colleague this question is now used to
4:20:08
measure The NPS score so the customer will respond on a scale
4:20:14
of 0 to 10 a customer who gives a score between 0 and 6 is a detractor a
4:20:21
customer who gives a score between 7 and 8 is passive a customer who gives a
4:20:27
score between 9 and 10 is a promoter
4:20:32
to calculate NPS you subtract the percentage of promoters from the
4:20:38
percentage of detractors it is a way to understand how happy people are using
4:20:43
your product it makes sense because if someone is willing to refer your product to others they must really be happy with
4:20:51
its performance customer acquisition cost the entire organization puts in efforts to win a
4:20:58
customer the total of all the efforts in dollar terms is the customer acquisition cost
4:21:05
for the product this is generally one of the major expenses for any SAS organization the sales and marketing
4:21:12
teams are major contributors to this course this is because a lot of times the focus is on Upstream activities to
4:21:19
attract and convert customers the formula for customer acquisition cost is it's the sum of the money spent
4:21:26
on acquiring customers bounce rates is the percentage of people who leave your site after visiting only
4:21:34
one page a low bounce rate indicates that the visitors are finding what
4:21:39
they're looking for on the page which is great higher bounce rate might indicate one of
4:21:45
the following the entry page where they land on the website is not engaging enough to them to explore or decide or
4:21:52
the product further or there is a mismatch between the campaign message and the value
4:21:58
proposition highlighted on the landing page or the user experience on the landing
4:22:04
page is not optimal for engagement the formula for calculating bounce rates is
4:22:10
fairly simple you divide the total number of customers visiting only one page
4:22:17
by the total visits on that page daily active users or Dau all the users who
4:22:25
visit your site or product every day make up your daily active users in orders for the users to qualify as the
4:22:33
Au they need to make or take some meaningful actions on the site or app
4:22:39
you define these actions based on what engagement means for your product some
4:22:44
examples are a meaningful action could be logging into your product at least X number of
4:22:50
times each day or spending y minutes on the product or taking Z number of
4:22:55
actions monthly active users or Mau all users
4:23:00
who visit your site or app at least once over a 30-day period are your monthly
4:23:06
active users like the Au they need to perform some meaningful action defined
4:23:12
by you now you know what d a u and m-a-u-r stickiness is the ratio of Mau and the
4:23:19
Au it is expressed in terms of percentage product stickiness is an indicator of
4:23:26
how valuable your app is for users by looking at how often the user
4:23:32
but in some cases stickiness might not be the right metric for you
4:23:37
especially if you are a set and forget kind of an application for example an integration software where users set up
4:23:44
their integration between different applications and expect the data to stay in sync with each other the value of
4:23:51
such an app is that it is an automating a process for users if they have to keep
4:23:57
login in again and again it might be to troubleshoot errors so stickiness in
4:24:02
that case is not a good metric to evaluate how well your product is performing
4:24:08
feature adoption rate it is similar to Mau calculation Mau
4:24:14
measures how active users are on the product in general but feature adoption rate is
4:24:21
more specific it focuses on the adoption of a particular feature it is useful
4:24:26
when you're trying to find out the initial response to release to calculate
4:24:31
the feature adoption rate you divide the Mau of the feature by the Mau of the
4:24:37
product it is expressed as percentage the light score you can use a delight score to quickly
4:24:44
survey how people feel about a particular feature or product update you can trigger a survey questions to
4:24:51
pop up after a user has completed certain conditions for example your task management software and release a new
4:24:58
update it reduces the time for people to create a task as a product manager you want to find out how the feature is
4:25:05
doing you can do this by finding the Delight score of users who have tried on
4:25:10
the feature here's how you do it Define the conditions that qualify users to
4:25:15
take up the Delight score survey it could be creating a certain number of tasks using the new feature for example
4:25:22
if a user fulfills the condition the rely service presented to the user the survey basically asks the user how happy
4:25:29
they are using the new feature they have to provide an answer on a scale of one to five customer efforts score or CES we
4:25:37
all shop online right after we bought your 100th favorite pair of sneakers you
4:25:44
get an email right the company wants to know how your online ordering experience was with them usually this emails comes
4:25:53
right after you place the order the experience is fresh in your memory that
4:25:58
is what CES means CES focuses on ease of use you want your users to be able to use
4:26:05
your products seamlessly without any hiccups the primary goal of CES is to
4:26:12
find out how easy or difficult it is for users to interact with the product and
4:26:18
take action a CES survey is short and generally limited to just one question
4:26:24
where you ask the users about the experience with the specific action a
4:26:29
low CS code means the users had difficulty in completing the action and
4:26:35
you have your work cut out csat customers satisfaction score
4:26:41
csat helps you to get both qualitative and quantitative feedback from users it
4:26:47
not only tells you how satisfied or unsatisfied users are but also the reasons behind it
4:26:54
that helps in understanding the cause of dissatisfaction and eventually leads to
4:27:00
the solution to address the issues highlighted by the users a simple csat score consists of two
4:27:07
questions question one is the quantitative question how satisfied are you with the
4:27:14
products x on a scale of one to five this is then converted into a percentage
4:27:19
out of 100 here's the formula X by T into 100 where
4:27:25
X is the total number of users who rated four or five for the above questions and
4:27:32
T is the total number of users who answered the question for example if 200
4:27:38
people answer the questions and 100 out of them give a rating of 4 or 5 then the
4:27:43
csat score comes to 50 percent the second question is qualitative and
4:27:49
open-ended something like tell us the reason behind your rating its goal is to gather more
4:27:56
information on the why behind the rating this makes the feedback provided by
4:28:01
users more actionable you can add more questions to the survey find the balance between ease of filling out the survey
4:28:08
with the amount of information you want to gather it depends on the type of customer who are going to answer and how
4:28:15
engaged they are with your product monthly recurring Revenue mrr it is a
4:28:21
key metric for SAS companies to measure and track it is an important indicator of
4:28:27
the profitability and cash flow of the company it is the amount of money that the company can expect to earn in a
4:28:34
given month the calculation of mrr depends on how you build your client for example your
4:28:41
monthly subscription which costs 20 dollars per month to customers and you have thousand paying customers your mrr
4:28:49
is 20 in 2000 which is twenty thousand dollars average revenue per account arpa arpa is
4:28:59
the total amount of Revenue on from an account it is calculated by dividing the
4:29:04
total revenue earned from all accounts by the total number of accounts the
4:29:10
period over which it is calculated can be monthly or yearly depending on the
4:29:15
type of business arpa can be sometimes replaced by our pool this is the average
4:29:22
revenue per user formula for calculating advice as follows you divide the total revenue of
4:29:30
all accounts the total number of accounts average session duration also called the
4:29:37
dwell time a session duration is the amount of time a user has meaningful interactions with
4:29:44
the website according to Google average session duration is the total duration
4:29:51
of all the sessions divided by the number of sessions it tells you how much time users are
4:29:58
spending on your site high value of session duration indicates high level of
4:30:04
Engagement which is great marketing qualified lead or an mql an
4:30:11
mql is a lead that has shown considerable interest in your product as a result of marketing efforts some
4:30:19
examples how users engage with marketing efforts are downloading a case study white paper or
4:30:26
other marketing collateral signing up for a webinar or an online event
4:30:32
responding to an email campaign booking a product demo clicking on promotional emails sales
4:30:40
qualified lead or an SQL a sales qualified lead is one that is engaged
4:30:46
enough with the product and is ready to talk to the sales team there is often confusion about the difference between
4:30:52
mql and sqls so it's important to understand that both sales and marketing
4:30:57
teams have to agree on the definitions of each let's look at
4:31:02
it through an example you work for a SAS company the marketing team has come up
4:31:08
with a sales demo form along with other collaterals there are two leads let's
4:31:14
call them Sam and damn here is how they interact with the
4:31:19
company Sam comes to the website and signs up for demo by filling out the form tab on
4:31:26
the other hand downloads the case study and reads a bunch of Articles and then
4:31:32
signs up for a demo should both of them qualify as an SQL probably not Tam has
4:31:39
shown a greater in debt to buy versus Sam so you could argue that Sam is an
4:31:46
mql and tan is an SQL this might not always be true how you score your lead
4:31:52
and Define mql and SQL would depend on the unique needs of your business
4:31:58
similarly you have product qualified leads or pql pqls are not as common as
4:32:04
is counterpas and ql and sqls the basic idea though Remains the Same it is a
4:32:10
lead that is qualified by the product team before it moves down to the sales team let's look at it through an example
4:32:18
you launched a free trial for the size solution it enables prospects to sign up
4:32:24
for your product and use it now the traditional way to look at it is that every time a lease signs up for the free
4:32:30
trial it becomes an mql but not all leads are equal the level of
4:32:35
Interest may vary and you can gauge that by how users are behaving with the
4:32:41
product during the free trial period this is a way to qualify leads based on
4:32:46
product indicators you can go and Define when the lead becomes a pql it could be
4:32:53
when a free trial user logs in next number of times or spends why amount of
4:32:58
minutes or carries Z actions on the product you refine conditions that make
4:33:04
sense for your product and Industry over time when once you gather more data on
4:33:09
the behavior of users you'll be able to refine your conditions even more active
4:33:15
users as the name suggests it is the total number of users who are engaging
4:33:20
with your site for a given period of time it helps you understand the level
4:33:26
of Interest your content of product Garners or the amount of time users
4:33:32
remain engaged with you is there an industry Benchmark for this not really it varies and depends on a number of
4:33:39
factors for example what is the product or service you're selling and how long does sales cycle last
4:33:46
if you're active user numbers are below what you'd expect them to be then look at your marketing programs and see if
4:33:55
your key value proposition and messaging are on point or you have the right sales
4:34:02
enablement tools to help engage with your customers Impressions Impressions
4:34:08
is the total number of times your content has been displayed on the screen
4:34:14
the user does not need to engage with the content to for it to be counted as
4:34:20
an impression let's look at an example you tweeted something today
4:34:26
and you have total 500 followers on Twitter your Tweet shows up on every
4:34:34
user field in this case your total impressions are 500.
4:34:39
after a week you come back and post something else
4:34:44
it again shows up on every followers field your total Impressions now are thousand
4:34:53
which is 500 from earlier and 500 from today reach is the total number of
4:34:59
people who've seen your content let's follow the above impression example 500
4:35:04
people saw your first tweet so your reach is 500. after week your second
4:35:10
post was also seen by 500 that is all your followers your reach is still 500
4:35:16
unlike Impressions which was doubled reach is to users what Impressions is to
4:35:22
screen organic traffic it is the total traffic that comes from
4:35:29
unpaid sources it means that it does not come from an ad you publish on Google Facebook or Instagram
4:35:36
it happens when your content shows up as a search results for someone organic
4:35:41
traffic is great because of a few reasons it generates high quality leads
4:35:47
people will reach your side because they are in search of a particular kind of
4:35:52
content it is also a cost effective the cost associated with Organic traffic is the
4:35:59
money spent on building meaningful content this is actually a fraction as
4:36:04
compared to what you spend on paid traffic in most cases and finally it's
4:36:10
longer lasting your content will continue to bring in relevant lead to your platform as long as it ranks high
4:36:17
in organic search results paid traffic it is the traffic that comes to you
4:36:23
aside from trade promotions that you run on sites like Facebook Google LinkedIn
4:36:29
or other places there are times when paid traffic will
4:36:34
make sense for you to invest in it is great for quickly getting your product
4:36:39
in front of users targeting to your user Persona and optimizing and testing
4:36:45
different variations to get the most out of them click through read email is an important
4:36:51
mechanism to engage with customers click-through rate is the percentage of people who clicked in a link in your
4:36:58
email for example if you send an email to 100 users to book a demo and 60
4:37:03
clicked on the link the CTR is 60 whether these finally complete the demo
4:37:10
booking form on the link does not impact CTR in the above example we will assume that
4:37:17
the email sent is equal to email delivered if out of 100 emails 10
4:37:22
bounced back then CTR will be 60 divided by 90 into 100 which is 66 percent
4:37:31
number of app installs this applies to mobile apps tracking the total number of
4:37:37
times your app has been downloaded and installed is a good metric to be aware
4:37:42
of you shouldn't however look at it in isolation for example the data can be misleading
4:37:50
if you have high app installs with high usage High app installs with equally
4:37:56
High uninstalls it means that there are issues with your app that you need to
4:38:01
sort out App Store reading this applies to mobile apps as well it gives you both
4:38:07
quantitative and qualitative measurements of how your app is performing it is also a great way to
4:38:13
increase customer confidence in your app people prefer downloading an app with
4:38:19
positive reviews than one without any this does not mean that you start pestering users to go and rate your app
4:38:26
on the store that Salon Works you should work to provide them with an exceptional
4:38:32
experience and nudge them to share it with everybody else make sure you always respond to feedback
4:38:40
you receive on the App Store it shows your engage with your customers and care
4:38:46
about them time to value or TTV TTV is
4:38:52
the total amount of time taken to complete a project and read the benefits
4:38:57
of the solution for example your company is adding new capabilities to its SAS
4:39:02
solution it enables customers to close deals faster sounds easy enough to understand
4:39:09
right the challenge though lies with measurements how do you measure the end of a project which is when the expected
4:39:15
value has been created for the end user it in this case for the value to be realized the product has to be developed
4:39:23
launched and sold to the customers then the customer has to implement the change
4:39:30
create this stuff use it and close deals using these new capabilities only when
4:39:37
all of this is done that the TTV is realizing your goal should always be to
4:39:44
reduce TTV return on investment or or Roi
4:39:50
Roi is the benefit you get from an investment as a product manager you'll
4:39:55
be calculating rois while prioritizing different features an important thing to
4:40:01
remember here is that rois will have a lot of underlying assumption backed by
4:40:06
historical data make sure to identify each of them and how it impacts the final calculation this will help you
4:40:13
improve your predictions over time some of the key inputs in the ROI
4:40:19
calculation will be how much time will it take to build the product what types
4:40:24
of resources are needed for development and launch these include engineering Marketing sales customer success and
4:40:32
support how is the value defined for the product it is easier to calculate for paid
4:40:38
products but it requires more effort to get to for free products
4:40:44
how long after the product launch will it take to get the first sale
4:40:49
virality we have all heard about viral videos you see something on Facebook you find
4:40:56
it hilarious you forward it to 10 friends who have a similar sense of humor they
4:41:02
do the same before you know it the total number of people who've seen it rises
4:41:08
exponentially so total views from a mathematical perspective then becomes you which is
4:41:16
one into your ten friends into 10 of their friends into 10 of their friends and so on
4:41:22
this is what virality is so how does this work for products your customers
4:41:28
love your product they refer it to their colleagues and so on and it sets a chain reaction all of a sudden there is a
4:41:35
surge of people signing up for your product through Raffles and other forms
4:41:41
you can add the following to your product to tap into virality social sharing of your product reference
4:41:49
program and tracking virality can be expressed as a factor
4:41:55
if we look at the formula it would be V is equals to x divided by y x here is
4:42:02
the total number of new users that sign up through existing users
4:42:08
and why is the number of total users we have covered a wide variety of
4:42:14
measurement metrics that are used across the board I want to reiterate what I said in the
4:42:21
beginning do not start measuring all of them for your product that is not the
4:42:27
point of this exercise once you've gone through all the 30 metrics and understand them take a
4:42:34
moment to reflect on it would any of these metrics make sense
4:42:40
for your product I'm sure you can find some that you'll find useful the point is that you don't
4:42:48
have to reinvent the wheel every time this is ton of research that has already
4:42:53
been done around these metrics you just need to find the ones that make sense
4:42:59
for your team all right everyone we're almost towards the end of the part one of our course
4:43:07
the two small topics that I do want to touch on and talk a little about before we go to part two
Product Launch vs Product Release
4:43:15
the first one is product launch must have seen and heard about product launches we did talk about it a bit
4:43:22
earlier as well product launches doesn't have to be only for softwares it could be for car or for
4:43:29
iPhone or for any other product product managers are involved in product
4:43:34
launches sometimes they might even lead them depending on the type and size of the company and product
4:43:41
but not all product releases will become product launches especially for software
4:43:47
products a lot of companies release software every week that does not mean that
4:43:54
you'll have a launch every week a product launch and a product release are two completely different things a
4:44:01
product release means that you have made some updates to your product for your users
4:44:07
it is usually accompanied by release notes which give you a high level description of the key components of the
4:44:13
release the engineering and the product team work together to get the release out
4:44:19
make sure to include the following in your product release what has changed
4:44:25
list each change as a separate bullet point how will it benefit users will all
4:44:33
users be affected with the change or will it be only some
4:44:38
keep your release notes short and to the point no marketing jargon just plain and
4:44:45
simple English there are specific customers who are looking for the release then let them
4:44:52
know ahead of time of the upcoming change keep a chronological release law so that
4:44:58
you know what went out when a product launch on the other hand is a product
4:45:04
release but on steroids a product launch is a much larger
4:45:10
multi-function effort between product engineering Marketing sales support
4:45:18
Finance customer success pretty much the all the business units are involved in
4:45:24
the product launch I have seen product managers own the launch in smaller companies in larger
4:45:31
companies someone else might do it it could be the marketing team
4:45:36
a product launch is often accompanied by some of these activities a press release
4:45:42
ad campaigns social media campaigns and customer conferences one of the most
4:45:49
challenging Paths of leading a product launch is to keep track of all the
4:45:55
moving parts because it's very easy for things to fall between the cracks
4:46:01
a product launch checklist goes a long way in making sure that everything goes
4:46:06
well on the launch day the checklist identify all the Key activities that need to be completed
4:46:13
before the launch there is usually a core launch team that means on a regular Cadence to track the
4:46:20
progress closer to the launch the frequency of meetings might increase let's look at a
4:46:26
launch template this checklist contains high level tasks that need to be completed besides this each team will
4:46:34
have their own separate checklist those checklists will be more specific with
4:46:39
granular details that roll up into the product launch checklist
4:46:44
a lot of items will require multiple peoples from different teams to
4:46:50
collaborate with each other however have only one owner assigned to
4:46:55
each item who is ultimately responsible for the completion of that activity now
API for Product Managers
4:47:01
let's talk about apis apis for product managers we wanted to end the part one with the
4:47:08
technical topic we'll try to explain it in the most non-technical way possible
4:47:14
actually if you're on the fence on whether to include this in the course or not but we decided to add it seeing how
4:47:21
the software World in general is moving towards cooperation now instead of
4:47:27
building siled application and it's evident from what we're seeing recently
4:47:33
even Microsoft is not so Cooperative software in the past wants its product to work with everything from Apple to
4:47:41
Linux and everything else in the middle we will keep it short and try
4:47:48
to not put in too much jargon in it our goal is that when someone talks about apis in a meeting you don't draw a blank
4:47:57
so let's get started what is an API well it stands for application
4:48:03
programming interface wait what what does that even mean
4:48:10
is it a program is it a language the framework is it a bird
4:48:16
don't worry we'll just find out let's look at two non-technical examples of
4:48:23
things that we used that can be called an API example one most of us use light
4:48:31
switches right or are we all relying on Alexa these
4:48:36
days okay so I'm talking about the traditional light switch here
4:48:41
all we need to do is to turn the switch on or off to turn the light on and off
4:48:49
we don't know the mechanics of what happens from the moment we press the switch
4:48:55
we don't need to be an electrical engineer and know how the current flows how the wiring is done
4:49:01
all we need to know is that pressing the switch in a certain way does something
4:49:06
to the light bulb in this case the light switch is the API
4:49:12
and the marking on the switch which point to on or off is the API
4:49:18
documentation sounds simple enough right now let's build on our very non-traditional
4:49:24
example and look at a more traditional API which we use in our daily lives
4:49:31
so a lot of us read reviews right you can do a lot more with an API an API
4:49:36
will let you read the reviews like we usually do or make changes which we also do it will
4:49:44
also let us do bulk operations for example instead of copy pasting all the
4:49:49
reviews from one after the other you can call in API and download all the reviews
4:49:57
it also lets us do stuff without traditional uis the kind you use on the internet with
4:50:04
buttons and stuff instead what you'll be using was is a dialog box to make an API
4:50:09
call make some changes based on what you need and boom it'll get done
4:50:16
let's get a little more technical now and convert what we said about into technical lingo
4:50:22
you can perform crowd operations using an API that is you can create stuff
4:50:30
you can read stuff you can update stuff and you can delete stuff
4:50:35
You Must Be Wondering saurabh I understand apis in a non-technical and Technical way now
4:50:42
but where will I need it I'm a product manager good question so imagine you work for a
4:50:50
tech team of a restaurant and they want to show all their Google reviews on
4:50:55
their website you can do it the old-fashioned way before you knew the power of the API by
4:51:02
going to the Google's review page of your restaurant and copy pasting them into a sheet and they're giving it to an
4:51:07
engineering team will then appear it to your website if you do that then you're engineering
4:51:14
team will lose all respect for you but don't worry we know our API is now
4:51:22
and we will Unleash the Power of apis to make it easy
4:51:28
instead of all the cumbersome way described above we can use Google's review API
4:51:34
you can read the documentation and find out the call which you need
4:51:40
now wait what is an API call is a predefined way to ask something to
4:51:47
an API it's basically you calling up Google's API and saying hey hello friend can you
4:51:54
give me all these reviews I need in a way that Google understands and responds it's that simple so try it out
4:52:03
you will hear a lot of jargon like soap API rest API restful apis
4:52:11
I won't get too much into it you just need to know that they are just
4:52:16
different ways to create apis in most cases you will be using a
4:52:22
restful API at least that's what most companies will claim they have
4:52:29
but you don't have to worry too much about it your Dev team can worry about it when I first learned about apis I
4:52:36
ended up reading Roy fieldings dissertation on it
4:52:43
I'd encourage you to read it as well in your free time
4:52:48
nowadays everyone uses Postman which is an application you can use to make API
4:52:54
calls and will do much more it's super easy to use you should definitely try that as well now apis are also used to
4:53:02
make bulk updates or changes like we talked about for example you are on a
4:53:08
small online shopping website you send all your packages via DHL you want users
4:53:16
to be able to check the status of your package from your site instead of going
4:53:23
to DHL site what do you do you can hire a person to go through the
4:53:28
DHL tracking numbers for all the packages every r on DHL and then update it on
4:53:36
your website or you can use dhl's API and get that information using their API
4:53:43
endpoints and show that information directly on your website
4:53:48
the choice is yours I'm sure you'll use an API now
4:53:54
and finally we're going to talk about the API Force approach
4:54:00
it means that every action you can take using the UI of your website or
4:54:07
application can also be done using an API call if
4:54:12
you do this while building out your product it will vastly extend its value
4:54:18
I think we have learned enough about apis now to help us get started
Part 2 Introduction
4:54:27
I hope you had fun learning about all the different aspects of product management in part one of the course
4:54:34
now it's our turn to apply all that we learned into a product update the goal
4:54:39
of this exercise is to help you get better at applying theoretical Concepts
4:54:44
in a real world setting say not everything is Black or White
4:54:49
there are more gray areas then you'd like to admit just like my hair
4:54:56
or my beard for that man in trying to pick up the right products
4:55:01
we looked at various different possibilities we looked at e-commerce websites car
4:55:07
checkout experiences and platform for buying and selling cars and other products challenge to be faced by
4:55:14
deciding on the right product or service to build in this part of the course was
4:55:20
that it started to get too complicated too fast we wanted to keep the product
4:55:26
simple enough for everyone to understand but with enough in it
4:55:31
to be able to put some of our learnings into practice so we finally picked up a to-do list a
To Do List
4:55:39
to-do list is an application you use to create and manage things that you need
4:55:45
to track if you're a developer and have done other courses or tutorials you'll find
4:55:51
this as a very common example it enables you to focus on the key
4:55:56
concept without getting bogged down so let's set this stage for the product
4:56:01
we're going to build the to-do list let's assume you work as
Assumptions
4:56:07
a product manager for a company which wants to build a to-do list application for its Target users
4:56:14
for the sake of Simplicity we make some assumptions here that will help us not
4:56:19
get entangled and keep things clear so here are the four assumptions we're
4:56:25
going to start with number one building this application aligns with the company's Visions goals
4:56:32
and objectives number two preliminary data suppose
4:56:38
building and testing out a to-do list number three development resources are
4:56:45
available to build the application and number four the first version of the product needs
4:56:52
to be a web application and not mobile app all right now since that's out of the
4:56:58
way let's get down to the task at hand like we talked about in the earlier
4:57:03
section we cannot jump right into building lots and lots of features well we can but now we know better we'll
4:57:10
start by building an MVP and iterate using the BML cycle to check the
MVP Steps
4:57:15
validity of our team's assumptions in order to build the MVP we need to follow the four steps outline in our MVP
4:57:23
section so let's go through the four steps step one you need to develop our hypothesis
4:57:30
here is what I came up with if we provide users the ability to manage
4:57:36
their tasks then the productivity will increase by 27 percent
4:57:42
this could be one of the hypothesis you can create your own if you want the 27
4:57:48
is something I just came up with randomly for the sake of this exercise in the real world I'd expect you to do
4:57:55
all the things we discussed in part one of the course to get to that number is Step 2
4:58:01
identify the target users think about what we learned in the past
4:58:07
who do you think will be the innovators and early adopters for this MVP does your company already have customers
4:58:14
who will use this product the first person is Jim who works in sales at a
4:58:21
paper company and dreams of becoming the highest paper selling salesman
4:58:27
apparently that's a thing he'd like to be able to better manage
4:58:32
his time by keeping all his follow-ups organized nothing makes him happier than
4:58:40
a happy customer the second Persona is Dwight who is a homemaker and wants to keep his
4:58:47
household on track and stop making those unwanted grocery runs
4:58:53
and also a better way to communicate with his partner on things that needs to
4:58:58
be done once you've built it out it's time to talk to potential users to find
4:59:04
out how closely your idea of the users matches with the
4:59:10
ground reality as you can see we have two completely different personas who want similar outcomes at least in the
4:59:17
beginning one is a B2B user which is Gene and another is a b2c user which is joy we
4:59:24
need to ask ourselves if we want to focus on one versus the other or are we
4:59:30
targeting both for our MVP they might have similar needs in the beginning but the problems in the future
4:59:36
might greatly vary and require separate solution so the Persona you eventually Target
4:59:43
will also be dependent on your product strategy for the purpose of a discussion we'll
4:59:50
assume that gym salesman who is a B2B user more closely aligns with our company's goal so now we
4:59:58
know who our Target Persona is it's time to go and look at the step three
5:00:04
step three is about gauging the market opportunity for this you will further look into the
5:00:11
size of the problem you're trying to solve in the above section we have also assumed that the utilities for that has
5:00:18
already been done some easy ways to reinforce your conviction is to do some market research
5:00:24
to find additional data points on the following questions are there existing products in the
5:00:31
market who you will compete with how are they doing how new or old are these
5:00:37
products what's their value proposition any particular industry they focus on
5:00:43
any industry posts out there that you could read is anyone looking for a to-do list
5:00:50
solution I usually break down my research into two parts based on which I eventually
5:00:56
form my opinion on the above questions the first part is to look at the market
5:01:02
in general by General I mean that you look at apps that might give you a to-do
5:01:07
list solution or others that might give you a little more or substitute that might also solve
5:01:14
the problem but a bit differently based on your research you divide up the market and competition
5:01:21
let's look at some of the to-do list market research we did we looked at 10
5:01:27
companies that Target similar use cases in reality this list would be much
5:01:34
bigger but I feel that this should be enough for the goal of our exercise
5:01:40
or if you're trying to learn here I encourage you to come up with your own
5:01:45
list similar to mine this is how we build a shield we try to find if there are any industry
5:01:51
reports we could look at we found a lot of reports on product
5:01:57
management project management or collaboration but nothing that was
5:02:02
specific to to-do list we also looked at the use cases for each
5:02:07
product and the features that fulfill them then we looked at what the company really
5:02:14
markets for example are they marketing themselves as an all-in-one project
5:02:20
management solution or all in one task manager the messaging on each company's
5:02:27
website gave us a clear indication of that then we grouped the companies by the different types of solutions that
5:02:33
emerged we could see some themes emerge at this point of time we looked at whether they compete with
5:02:42
our solution directly or indirectly and finally the price point at which they
5:02:49
operate I don't expect you to know everything about each of them
5:02:55
just a general sense of where there are this will help you find the ones that
5:03:00
truly will be your competitors in the initial days versus the one you might
5:03:06
need to look at more closely in the future the second part of the exercise is to do
5:03:12
a deep dive on companies that you will compete with now in our case it could be
5:03:19
todoist or afternoon let's do a deep dive on to-do list and
5:03:25
see what we can find use all the ways we talked about in part one of our course
5:03:30
on the market research so let's talk through our Deep dive and see what we came up in rxlg
5:03:38
so we Google todoist and we saw lots of targeted ads from even more competitors
5:03:46
the future handle also came up which was very interesting oh and the app so
5:03:52
reading is off the charts 4.8 with more than 85k Road views waha
5:03:59
the website says that they support over 35 million users and 20 languages how we
5:04:06
can't go and present this sheet to anyone yet the information is there
5:04:11
but it's not very coherent I want you to try and come up with some
5:04:16
bullet points on how you will bring together all this information and then we can look at mind
5:04:22
ready hopefully you did some digging and came up with a description that provides a
5:04:27
well-rounded understanding of to-do lists to anyone in our team who leads it
5:04:32
let's look at what we've got to do is is
5:04:37
a One-Stop solution for individuals and businesses looking for a task manager
5:04:43
application its motto is organize your work and life
5:04:50
and helps you to do that with simple and intuitive application it is highly rated
5:04:55
across platforms for example it's average App Store rating like you said is off the charts some of the key
5:05:02
aspects of to-do lists that are relevant to our product team are as follows
5:05:08
it has a simple and intuitive experience it has extensive and I need really
5:05:16
extensive support across operating systems platforms devices browsers you
5:05:23
name it and they have it is developer friendly with publicly available restful apis and sdks
5:05:30
they also have another product called twist for communication which does provide us with some insight into their
5:05:38
product strategy and where they might be headed in the long run goals for them
5:05:43
increase monthly poll when they release their native apps for mobile phones since we initially made the assumption
5:05:51
that we will build our web up first we'll go with that for our exercise but
5:05:57
in the real role if you encounter data that was contrary to the assumptions you have made
5:06:03
then it might be worthwhile to dig deeper and see if you need to change anything
5:06:10
this is something that you should probably discuss further with your team looking at the product features more
5:06:17
closely you can see the task is at the center of everything
5:06:23
it has a description priority reminder and due dates tasks can be added to a
5:06:31
project the lots of related actions and tasks you can copy link to tasks you can
5:06:37
duplicate tasks you can add comments via email you can view the task activity you
5:06:43
can print a tasks you can delete a task and lots more users can track update on
5:06:48
their tasks through email mobile and in-app notification search can be done
5:06:53
using the search bar or using the default or custom filters that you can
5:06:59
set on the search criteria you can also use this information eventually to
5:07:06
create battle cards for your sales teams to help them be well prepared to answer questions on competition during sales
5:07:13
calls from a business perspective the private and profitable without funding which
5:07:20
means that they can take a long-term view when it comes to investments in Farah
5:07:26
as is also evident from when you look at the product they meet 14 million dollars in 2020 in
5:07:35
rev from a user experience perspective the release at a regular Cadence to
5:07:41
provide value to their users they also respond to customer feedback on public forums very regularly step
5:07:49
four is to evaluate the technical feasibility what will the technology stack of a
5:07:55
to-do list look like once you Thrust out the definition of your MVP talk to your
5:08:01
talk to your engineering counterparts to find out what the best ways to get it out of the door
5:08:06
you could either build it from scratch buy it or partner with someone else
5:08:13
this is an important aspect that is completely overlooked a lot of times
5:08:18
make sure you use the engineering team's input to draw a final conclusion now let's try and chart out a user's
To Do List User Story Mapping
5:08:26
path on how they might go about creating this to-do list MVP
5:08:32
let's try user story mapping something we learned in the part one of our course
5:08:38
you'll find that the user story map gets more and more complicated as a product grows there might be multiple paths that
5:08:46
users can take and everyone's map might look a bit different you will be working with the counterparts from sales
5:08:52
marketing and other customer facing teams to come up with the user story map
5:08:57
so let's look at how our map looks like level one is about creating the to-do
5:09:04
list MVP this becomes your epic pretty simple level 2 has the various things
5:09:11
that users do in order to build and manage their to-do list you can also
5:09:17
call them the user stories that make up the MVP you'll have sign up which is
5:09:22
where the user starts in order to use the app people will need to sign up in our first iteration we let the users use
5:09:30
this Google account to sign up for the service once the user has signed up then login into their account
5:09:37
after successfully logging in they will create a list once they have completed creating a list
5:09:43
they want to save their work at some point they might also want to
5:09:49
copy their list and reuse it in on the project or delete the list if they don't want to
5:09:55
use it anymore the level 2 of a user story map looks
5:10:00
fairly complete now so let's look at level three level three
5:10:05
are the actions that users take in each stage for example for logging in users
5:10:11
need to provide their Gmail ID and authenticate with it you can have more levels in your user
5:10:18
story depending how extensive the scope of your project is by looking at everything laid out in
5:10:25
front of us it becomes easier for us to identify what it really needs to be
5:10:30
built and what can be it and this will then become input when prioritizing
5:10:36
completing work for an MVP let's bring together everything we've
Defining the MVP
5:10:42
learned so far for this product and put more definitions to our MVP
5:10:49
so the first thing we want to Define is what is the problem we're trying to solve we've talked about it a little bit
5:10:55
but let's be very clear and Define it as a user I want to be able to keep
5:11:01
track of things I need to do and be efficient the next part of the definition is who will benefit from it
5:11:08
the target user for the MVP is anyone who is list driven and Technology savvy
5:11:15
they need to juggle a lot of things in the personal or professional lives
5:11:21
if they're able to keep track of all the things they need to do it will make them more productive
5:11:27
we're assuming that this is based on all the research we've done and interactions and conversations is
5:11:34
had with potential users so what will the first iteration of the
5:11:40
MVP look like so we want you at this point to go back to part one of a course to the MVP Test
5:11:48
Section and create what you think on a high level the MVP could look like here is
5:11:55
what we think it's going to look like the core functionality we feel needs to
5:12:01
be part of the MVP is the ability to create a list save or edit
5:12:06
there are some nice perhaps as well like remaining renaming the list auto saving
5:12:12
it and providing basic formatting what we don't think needs to be part of the MVP at all is the need for extensive
5:12:19
integration or Advanced formatting or things like multi-user editing the list
5:12:25
you come up with versus what we might have will be different eventually what
5:12:30
goes into each bucket might completely change based on what you learn from the
5:12:36
first version of the MVP for example we might learn that people really care
5:12:42
about formatting and that needs to become a priority for the team so how
5:12:47
will you bring this to-do list MVP to the market you can either build by or partner like
5:12:54
we discussed in part one in this scenario however we're going to assume that our in-house Dev team has the
5:13:02
skills time and resources to build out the product and we will go with the
5:13:07
build route all right so now we know on a very high level what we want to build but how are
5:13:13
we going to measure the success of our MVP the key criteria for the success of the
5:13:20
MVP is how valuable users find the to-do list
5:13:25
now what does valuable mean to us we need to add a little bit more clarity
5:13:32
on that and how will we also measure valuable one way could be to see how many people
5:13:39
sign up for the product but is that truly the right measure for Success how
5:13:45
many applications do you sign up and never end up using just look at your
5:13:50
phone and check out all the apps you've downloaded you'll know what I'm talking about it is easy to feel great about
5:13:58
your MVP by measuring vanity metrics but they will lead to nothing
5:14:04
if you look at the long list of metrics we went through in the part one of our course we come across a few that sound
5:14:12
useful specifically three of them makes sense to me to track
5:14:17
they are stickiness churn rate and Delight score for a MVP we will assume that we have
5:14:25
some historical data on how these metrics turned out for similar features
5:14:31
in our existing portfolio we will use that as a starting point to define acceptable values for these
5:14:38
metrics so now are we going to stick with these metrics forever
5:14:44
most likely not the just the starting point like we discussed for example while running the MVB we
5:14:53
might find out that one month is too long for us to wait in order to review
5:14:58
the metrics in that case we need to come up with a modified definition of
5:15:04
stickiness because Mau tracks users on a monthly basis
5:15:10
also the active thought in the d a u and Mau will most likely need some
5:15:17
additional definition for example are we going to count anybody who signs up for a to-do list as an active user
5:15:24
or do they need to create a list or do some actions to be deemed as active
5:15:30
what do you think now that we're clear about the higher level definition of our MVP it's time to
Epics |UserStories |Tasks
5:15:37
talk out the details because Beyond clearly defined requirements your product release will keep on getting
5:15:43
delayed and delayed and weeks will become months and months will become ears I'm not trying to scare you or
5:15:50
anything but this is a hard truth which as a product manager you need to understand and take
5:15:55
responsibility for all right now it's time to create something that the developing team can
5:16:01
actually work on we'll have an epic the goal of this epic is to enable users to
5:16:06
create and manage a to-do list since it's an MVP and not a fully fledged Out product yet we will build
5:16:14
out users stories under this one Epic only alright so let's try out this is
5:16:19
what a user story that I wrote looked like as a user I want to be able to
5:16:25
create lists the acceptance criterias are as follows you to have a sign up URL
5:16:32
a user can sign up with their Gmail account if the account already exists the following error message should be
5:16:39
shown to the user account already exists once the once they are successfully
5:16:44
authenticated using Gmail they will be bought to the home screen users can create a new list by clicking
5:16:52
the add list button the button takes the users to a new list page users should be asked to provide a
5:17:02
name for list they can add multiple items to the list users can check an
5:17:08
item when it's completed checked item will go to the bottom of the list the checked item will
5:17:15
have a strike off line to show that is sung wow that's a really big user story
5:17:22
do you agree need to bring back our learnings back into action let's put this story to test with the
5:17:29
invest framework is it independent hmm definitely not lots of dependencies
5:17:36
and story that I can see is it negotiable though I guess we can say it's negotiable we
5:17:44
are open to changes at this point as we've been talking about throughout this time
5:17:50
is this valuable absolutely it is valuable because it enables us to validate our MVP
5:17:56
is it estimable looking at the story again I I feel that
5:18:02
it will be very very hard to estimate such a massive story so definitely not estimable
5:18:09
is it small with 11 acceptance criterias even before it hits the grooming session
5:18:16
it doesn't look small by any definition or measure so it's definitely not small
5:18:23
is it testable I ask your QA team that I don't think
5:18:29
looking at this story they will they will say that it's easy to test at all because it's just so huge
5:18:35
unfortunately our first attempt at writing the user story hasn't gone too well
5:18:41
but it's okay let's let's try again based on what we've learned this time we
5:18:46
will break things down a bit more and think about the invest framework every
5:18:52
time we try to finish up a story Okay so we've gone back and broken down
5:18:58
the stories uh and this is how it looks like the user Story one is all about
5:19:05
being able to sign up for the to-do list application and that's pretty much it as
5:19:10
a user I want to be able to sign up for the to-do list applications it has file acceptance criterias the first one being
5:19:18
users can start signing up by clicking on the sign up button a user can sign up with the Gmail
5:19:24
account if the card already exists an error message will show up
5:19:30
once users have successfully authenticated they will be asked to accept the terms and conditions and once
5:19:37
they do that they will be taken to the home screen now let's look at the user story too
5:19:44
this is all about being able to sign in see there's a difference the first one was about just signing up
5:19:51
and this story is All About signing into the application as a user I want to be
5:19:58
able to sign into the to-do list application it is only three acceptance criteria users can log in by clicking on
5:20:06
the login button they will be asked to authenticate once completion of
5:20:11
authentication they will be taken to the home page the next user's story is only about
5:20:18
creating and adding things to a list as a user I want to be able to create a
5:20:25
list and add things to it that I need to remember it has four acceptance criterias users
5:20:32
can create a list by clicking add list button the button takes the users to a new list
5:20:40
page users will be asked to provide a name for the list they can add multiple
5:20:46
items to the list the next user story is about saving
5:20:52
changes you make to a list as a user I want to be able to save changes I make
5:20:58
to my list it has only two acceptance criterias in order to save their changes users
5:21:05
need to click this save button if users don't want to save the changes
5:21:10
they can either press cancel button or close the window without saving the changes
5:21:17
the next user story is about marking items as complete as a user I want to be
5:21:25
able to mark items complete when they are done it has three acceptance criterias users
5:21:32
can check an item when it's completed the checked item will go to the bottom of the list and the checked item will be
5:21:39
striked off to show that it's done user Story 6 is about accessing all the
5:21:46
lists that you've created as a user I want to be able to access all my lists
5:21:52
in one place has only two acceptance criteriors all the list will show up on the home screen
5:22:00
the list will be ordered by when they are modified with the most recently
5:22:05
modified one showing at the top and the last user story is all about
5:22:11
deleting a list as a user I want to be able to delete a list it has two
5:22:18
acceptance criterias a user can delete a list by clicking on the trash icon next
5:22:23
to them once deleted the list cannot be retrieved you want to point out a very
5:22:31
important aspect about the user stories that we just looked at
5:22:37
designs are missing in our user stories in the real world when you write user
5:22:44
story you will be accompanying High Fidelity designs with the requirements you will work with
5:22:51
the design team to get them ready before the grooming meeting so please please
5:22:57
remember that when you write user stories for a team at your workplace you
5:23:04
need to add the designs to them seems like we've made a lot of progress we now
5:23:11
have seven stories that seemed complete at least to us
Grooming Stories
5:23:17
it's time to groom them with your team and get a reality check remember there are some things you will
5:23:25
need to do to make sure that the meeting is efficient and successful and doesn't
5:23:30
go off the crack so especially since this would be the first meeting for the
5:23:35
project we've discussed a lot of these in part one of our course
5:23:40
but let's rejog our memory a little bit here are the things you should do
5:23:46
you should send out the links to the stories in advance asking the participants to read them make sure you
5:23:51
invite the right stakeholders work with the engineering counterpart to make sure that all the right people are in the
5:23:56
room if you have a business case or presentation that you did in the discovery stage make sure you provide
5:24:01
access to it to the Team MVP grooming meetings can often spiral out of control
5:24:07
especially because we're trying to build the bare minimum often you'll be pushed to add a bit more
5:24:14
because it's possible without much work do not fall for it only build what's
5:24:20
needed there is a reason that mvp starts with minimum
5:24:27
all right so we did all that and the day has finally come to Guru my stories exciting times We Begin by giving a
5:24:34
short description of what the plan is emphasizing that it's an MVP and we will
5:24:40
add more things depending how users feel about the update we have the engineering manager The
5:24:47
Architects a few devs and qas that are going to be working on this update in
5:24:52
the room now we get down and get some real grooming done we start by giving an overview of how we have structured our
5:25:00
update one Epic with seven user stories that are intended to deliver the MVP
5:25:06
we bring up our first user story up on the big screen for everybody to see
5:25:12
if we read through the description and the acceptance criteria and give the team some time to come up with their
5:25:20
feedback and here it is what type of Gmail authentication do you
5:25:25
want are the different types of authentication flows in Gmail what if the user does not want to sign
5:25:32
up with their email and want to instead create their own account
5:25:37
doesn't it seem like they should be allowed to do that
5:25:42
why only Gmail why can't we do Outlook Facebook or Apple
5:25:48
is this supposed to be mobile friendly we will we get separate designs for that
5:25:54
what if the authentication fails what will happen then
5:25:59
is there an error that needs to pop up how we will track the success of failure
5:26:06
of our update wow that's a lot of great questions
5:26:12
didn't expect that coming into the meeting did we being bombarded by a ton of questions in
5:26:20
your very first user story itself is hard when this happened to me for the first
5:26:26
time I ran out of the grooming meeting and I felt like crying
5:26:32
I just didn't want to be in the room like everybody else I also take a lot of
5:26:37
pride in my work and when people start poking holes in them it hurts a little
5:26:44
but the truth is as a product manager you will be in a lot of situations like this
5:26:50
and it will be easy for you to get disheartened all I can advise you is please don't
5:26:58
there is no such thing as a perfect user story I have never seen anybody write a
5:27:05
perfect user story the user story that you like does not
5:27:10
belong to you the engineering team is asking all these questions because they need this
5:27:18
information in order to get the job done not to make you feel bad
5:27:23
this is something that nobody will ever admit not all product and Engineering teams
5:27:30
get along well and when they don't the product suffers
5:27:37
and the user suffers so remember your job is not to write a
5:27:43
perfect user story your job is to write the user story with every possible
5:27:48
scenario you can think of and then work through the questions that come up
5:27:54
what you will see happening over time with the experience the ways that your user stories will keep getting better
5:28:00
and better and your acceptance criteria will start accounting for more and more
5:28:06
use cases so for now how do you tackle these questions that have come up there is one
5:28:13
really powerful statement I wish I knew when I started out
5:28:18
can I get back to you later on this yes as simple as this
5:28:26
the thing is that you don't need to come up with the answers in The Grooming
5:28:31
session itself of course there will be some things that you know and you forgot
5:28:37
to add in the AC but others might require you to go back and do some due diligence
5:28:44
or you might have a counter questions that might require the development team's effort and for them to do some
5:28:50
digging with this knowledge let's try and tackle each of the questions that came up in
5:28:57
our first user story here's the first one what type of Gmail authentication do you
5:29:02
want us to use does Gmail have different types of authentication flows
5:29:08
do we have other products that use Gmail Authentication were you expecting the team to use the
5:29:14
same flow as them if yes then update the AC with that information so it's clearer
5:29:20
if not then this requires you to do some research and get back to the team on
5:29:25
make a note of this and move on to the next questions after the meeting is over you have to rework your story you
5:29:34
probably have to go and read up Google's literature on authentication or an authorization most likely you'll have to
5:29:41
talk to the engineering manager or the team Tech lead to nail down the right approach for this question the next
5:29:48
question that came up was what if the users do not want to sign up with their
5:29:53
email and want to create their own account doesn't seem like they get to choose
5:30:00
right now these questions requires Flora clarification
5:30:05
when you wrote your requirement you probably chose Gmail because of a certain reason maybe you had data to
5:30:11
suggest that most of your target users had Gmail and you wanted to focus only
5:30:16
on that but if you don't have a strong reason why you picked up Gmail over others
5:30:22
and why only one type of authentication was used then you probably need to go
5:30:28
back to the drawing board why only Gmail accounts what about Outlook Facebook and
5:30:33
Apple the answer to it is the same what we discussed about are they supposed to be mobile friendly
5:30:40
will we be given separate designs for that um we might have not thought about this
5:30:47
how are people accessing our product right now also this begs the question as to how
5:30:53
much additional engineering work will be required to make this mobile friendly
5:30:58
so some work here for both the teams to do you'll need to follow up on that the next question was what if
5:31:06
authentication fails what should happen then is there an error that needs to pop up
5:31:12
seems like a miss we need to add an error message and flow of where users land up when this happens
5:31:19
and finally how will we track the success of failure of our update this is a more general question that per
5:31:26
se pertains to all users stories why we came up with the metrics we wanted to measure and how we want to crack the
5:31:33
success we forgot to add the work that needs to be done to make sure that the
5:31:39
right Plumbing is in place even though it talked about it earlier talking about plumbing and stuff
5:31:45
we forgot to add it to our user stories and that can happen so make sure to add the events that the
5:31:52
team needs to track for you to be able to report it this part is sometimes owned by the data
5:31:59
analytics team if you work for a big company but if you work for a small company you most likely be working very
5:32:06
closely with your engineering counterpart to make this happen implementation and requirements will
5:32:13
vary depending on the tools you use we could go on and look at all the other user stories and poke holes in them but
5:32:20
I think it would be better if you do that exercise and see what happens share with us what you find
5:32:27
I know that you might have initially thought that you write your users stories you do your grooming sessions
5:32:33
and that's it unfortunately it's never like that it's
5:32:38
not a linear process there is a lot of back and forth especially at the beginning of new projects
5:32:45
so if you take your few grooming sessions before your stories are at a
5:32:50
point where they can be picked up by the development team you always have the option of ignoring everything I'm saying
5:32:58
the teams where user stories go from the PMS laptop directly into the dev queue
5:33:06
but it never really ends actually it doesn't end at all the dev team will ramp up and they start working on the
5:33:12
story and soon realize that there's so many loose ends that need to be tied up
5:33:18
and now they will just wait for you to answer these questions but by now you've already moved on to
5:33:24
something else and taken up more work where you clearly needed to focus on these user stories
5:33:30
still not a good situation for either the developer or the product manager to be
5:33:35
in the moral of the story is to take your grooming sessions seriously
5:33:43
the last section was not so much fun people taking apart our users stories
5:33:49
and being critical of them now let's assume you have worked through all the user stories and the dev team is
5:33:55
happy with them they've moved them over to their backlog and started the work you joined the daily stand-up to stay in
Daily Standup Example
5:34:02
tune with what's happening with the project you're available to unblock the engineering team in case they're stuck
5:34:08
and need more info to move forward let's look at the same user story
5:34:14
while working on the user Stories the developers had some doubts that needed to be cleared up
5:34:19
at the stand up the following questions come up Pam the developer working on creating
5:34:26
a new list story had the question about missing requirements this is what she
5:34:32
had to say couldn't find any information on the character limits on the names and
5:34:38
description fields like how many items can someone add to a list can you add a thousand or more this is a
5:34:46
clear missing requirements your response as a PM should be is this blocking you from working right
5:34:52
now by when do you need this information based on what Pam says you can
5:34:57
prioritize this with all the other things you have on your plate and move on no need to try and come up with
5:35:05
requirements in this meeting next up is Dwight another developer who
5:35:10
seems to have run into a much bigger issue this is what white has to say
5:35:15
I'm having trouble implementing the ux treatment of the strike off
5:35:20
I'm stuck I'm not really sure how to move forward while this seems like a longer
5:35:26
discussion you can parking lot it after the stand up and if at that point it seemed like even
5:35:33
a bigger issue then have a quick meeting organized between the right stakeholders
5:35:39
in this case you need to bring together the engineering manager the architect the front and back-end Developers for
5:35:46
this story as well as the QA and the ux team member responsible for this update
5:35:52
you might wonder why questions keep coming up after all these stories were
5:35:57
groomed over and over again I know it can be frustrating at times
5:36:03
but the thing is when you groom the stories you do it on the basis of the
5:36:09
information that is available to you at that point of time once development starts new information
5:36:16
is bound to come up during implementation that can impact how the product needs to
5:36:23
shape up one way to reduce such instances is by doing a research Spike whenever needed
5:36:30
but even then you will still have questions keep coming up as a product
5:36:35
manager you just need to be on top of it now let's assume that you ran the BML
Product Roadmap/Feedback
5:36:41
cycle a few times with a few iterations on the product you got lots of good feedback with
5:36:48
people asking for more and more you've reached your product Market fit and it's time to make your MVP into a fully
5:36:55
fleshed out products with its own roadmap what are some of the steps you'll take
5:37:02
one of the key inputs in the roadmap is all the feedback you get from your users your employees your prospects and
5:37:09
prioritize it to build out the roadmap for the features so let's look at a sample feedback for
5:37:16
the to-do list lots of great feedback coming from users looks like all work in the same office
5:37:25
sorry guys leave office joke I couldn't help myself okay so back to the feedback
5:37:31
now take some time to go over the feedback we have tried to replicate what you
5:37:39
should see the real world a wide variety of requests all of them seems like great things were
5:37:45
gone take some time to look at the feedback lots of people are asking for new
5:37:51
features that enable them to take more and more actions and fulfill more use
5:37:57
cases they also want to use the to-do list with their other applications few people
5:38:03
are also asking for features like public apis which will really change how the to-do list can be used
5:38:10
but are we there yet is this the right time for something like an API
5:38:17
product roadmaps can be presented in various phase let's try and build a
5:38:22
theme-based roadmap based on what we're hearing from customers prospects and internal
5:38:28
stakeholders in this feedback the themes that we come up with are for
5:38:33
the purpose of discussion only and a base of the sample feedback that we came up with
5:38:39
your product will map themes will greatly differ based on what the real world data tells you the other input in
5:38:47
building your roadmap will be your organization vision and goals and product strategy for this exercise we're
5:38:53
going to assume that they all align closely with the feedback that you're hearing from users
5:38:58
so let's look at our themes we've come up with two themes number one
5:39:04
is usability there are a lot of use cases that we need to support beyond the initial MVP
5:39:11
in order to make the to-do's list app an integral part of anyone's workflow so
5:39:16
prioritizing that work which increases its reusability and utility is one of
5:39:24
the themes for the road now the second theme that we want to focus on is Integrations
5:39:29
more and more people want to connect and use our list with other applications so
5:39:35
finding ways to make our to-do list talk to and work with other productivity
5:39:40
tools is an important thing to consider I think two themes are good enough for
5:39:45
the purpose of a discussion why don't you think of other possible things that might emerge out of the
5:39:52
product at this stage with this kind of feedback after going through this example please
5:39:58
don't start thinking that if you had to ever build a to-do list this would be
5:40:04
your MVP and your roadmap that's not the point of this exercise the goal of this
5:40:10
exercise is to make sure that you understand the process you need to
5:40:15
follow the questions you need to ask the trade-offs you need to make while building out your product
5:40:22
depending on the use cases your team needs to Target your mute B for the same product might look completely different
5:40:29
and so would your product or not for example a team might decide to get right
5:40:34
MVP is an Excel sheet Yes you heard that right in that case you don't need to build
5:40:40
anything just need to find a way to integrate Excel into the workflow of your product obviously there is much
5:40:46
more to it than that like you've already said the devils in the details let's go back and look at our feedback list once
5:40:54
again and start organizing it the first step is to go over the feedback and
5:40:59
identify the type of feedback it is are users looking for something completely
5:41:04
new an update to an existing functionality or other reporting a bug
5:41:11
s would follow their own path to resolution with the first Tempe you or
5:41:16
someone else trying to reproduce it we won't get too much into that right now
5:41:22
discussion for another time perhaps so why don't you pause this video for a minute and try and assign the type
5:41:29
to the feedback okay how did it go did you enjoy it don't worry if our sheets
5:41:36
don't exactly match what you might call an update I might assign as a new idea
5:41:41
since this is a hypothetical example we might have thought differently about the current state of the product in The Next
5:41:48
Step let's assign themes to all the product feedback for bugs let's put it under bucket
5:41:56
an important side note here if we go through the feedback on regular Cadence you won't get over by the volume
5:42:02
but I've seen it happen way too often when the product teams only look at the feedback
5:42:08
but it's time to present the roadmap to the team please don't become that product manager
5:42:14
if you're regular at evaluating and going through your feedback your job as a product manager will become a breeze I
5:42:21
promise now let's look at the feedback under our themes
5:42:26
is there a workaround that can solve the user's problem has this come up before
5:42:32
or can you come to a conclusion on the priority of this feedback based on the
5:42:38
information that is presented to you you can label the feedback as P1 to P4
5:42:43
based on your experience some feedback will require little or no investigation
5:42:49
While others I become larger multi-day efforts we have looked at a few
5:42:55
framework like rice in the earlier section that will help you prioritize completing ideas but would you apply
5:43:02
these Frameworks for every idea not really a product manager needs to be efficient with their time and needs to
5:43:09
prioritize it and spend it on things where there will be most impact by going
5:43:15
through some of the ideas you know of the bad if this is something the team won't work on since it won't align with
5:43:21
your organization goals for example if someone posts an idea that you need to build a mobile app
5:43:28
you won't go and do rice prioritization on it just yet building something like a
5:43:33
mobile app is a big organizational level decision and you won't pull a trigger on it by
5:43:39
using one framework you need to build a larger business case for it you should definitely keep track
5:43:45
of these requests and they will become part of the business case you build and help you show the demand of such an app
5:43:53
by a user base in fact sometimes there will be a whole product and engineering
5:43:58
team that manages the app with its own set of feedback we won't give a specific
5:44:04
example on how to use rice and other Frameworks you've already created some extensive videos earlier on on our
5:44:11
Channel and you can check them out if you want there will also be other feedback that
5:44:16
might focus on a segment of users who might not be a priority for the company for example public apis the user persona
5:44:23
for something like this is technical user or developer or an analyst
5:44:29
personally I am a big proponent of apis since it helps unleash the true power of
5:44:37
your product but it might not necessarily be the right thing for your company right now in the initial stages
5:44:43
of the to-do list app you may want to focus on things that provide the most
5:44:48
value to to-do list creators versus technical users so use your
5:44:54
understanding of a company's larger organizational goals product strategy and personas to do this first round of
5:45:02
prioritization and once you've done that apply all the great Frameworks you
5:45:07
learned to prioritize further once you have prioritized the roadmap
Communicating the Roadmap
5:45:12
the next step is to communicate to stakeholders communicating the roadmap requires balance it should not contain
5:45:20
too much information for people to get overl but it should contain enough information
5:45:26
to get people excited let's look at a sample roadbound based on a sample
5:45:31
feedback I keep using the word sample because I want you to not obsess too much about building the perfect to-do
5:45:38
list app I'd rather have you focus on understanding the process and the
5:45:44
journey that the product managers take and the logic behind making the choices they make
5:45:49
so let's bring up a sample roadmap one of the things that you will notice
5:45:55
is that there is hardly anything in there isn't that going to be a shock to everyone to see a roadmap presentation
5:46:01
with hardly anything in it relax the point is that we don't want to over and
5:46:07
everyone but that doesn't mean we'll stop at it we will obviously talk through each
5:46:13
section what we've done though is rolled up smaller upgrades into larger buckets
5:46:19
and highlighted which themes they belong to so you start with your presentation by talking about the themes and the
5:46:25
bucklers you can start with something like this by evaluating all the grid feedback from
5:46:32
users prospects and internal teams and by looking at our larger organizational
5:46:38
objectives we've decided to focus on two broad themes for the next little while
5:46:43
usability and Integrations which we believe will balance our need to satisfy
5:46:50
the growing user needs and make sure we make the right Investments for keeping
5:46:57
us competitive in the future I don't expect a lot of questions at the
5:47:03
stage assuming that you have consulted your key stakeholders and given them ample
5:47:09
insight into what they can expect in the roadmap next spend some time on giving examples
5:47:15
of key updates that would come under each group for example for editor updates you can
5:47:22
start talking about how building an advanced editor with more actions for
5:47:28
users will be the central theme of the update list out some of the other things that these updates will tackle things
5:47:34
that are of strategic importance things that people in the room might be
5:47:40
interested to hear about use both qualitative and quantitative evidence wherever possible to support
5:47:46
what you're planning to do not just for the sake of it but it's important to
5:47:51
point out that the product in roadmap has been built after a rigorous evaluation by the product teams
5:47:58
and not just build on a big and fancy of product managers some things you will be pressed on
5:48:05
during the roadmap presentations when by when I mean dates release dates
5:48:13
launch dates please don't get dates give General timelines because you can't
5:48:19
predict the future the stories are completely flushed out and therefore neither are your timelines
5:48:24
why this and not die some people might be waiting for some updates that did not
5:48:31
make it to the roadmap I really would have spoken to them earlier about it but
5:48:36
in reality there might be someone you missed and they might bring it up in the presentation your response as a PM should be
5:48:44
it's a great idea but when we evaluated this idea versus everything else it didn't seem like the
5:48:52
right time to work on it definitely something will keep track of in the future
5:48:58
we can talk more about it after the presentation thanks boom
5:49:04
avoid getting into a detailed discussion but in case it can't be avoided try to
5:49:12
keep it as short as possible oh and we almost forgot to say that
5:49:17
super important phrase that every product manager needs to know before starting any presentation
5:49:24
product roadmap is subject to change that concludes part two of our course
5:49:30
thanks to everybody who stuck around long enough and didn't bounce off there
5:49:37
are lots of Concepts that we talked about in the first section but didn't cover in our example that should not
5:49:43
stop you from trying them out yourself also while you have tried our best to
5:49:49
provide you well-rounded view of the different aspects of product management there might still be some things that we
5:49:56
missed do let us know if you're looking for something else
5:50:01
and we will try and add it to our Channel later next up we're going to test how much we
Product Management Certification Exam
5:50:08
learn from the super long course we have 50 multiple choice questions for you to
5:50:13
answer and a small assignment right after if we pass then you will get a product
5:50:21
management certificate from desker I'm as excited as you are best of luck

0:22
Have you ever wondered what successful CEOs like Jeff Bezos, Marissa Mayor, and Sunda Pichai have in common? Well, they
0:29
have all spent a part of their careers as product managers. With over 14,000 job openings on LinkedIn and salaries
0:35
ranging from 12 to 30 lakhs per year, product management has become a central focus for many companies across India.
0:42
It's clear that product management is emerging as a promising career with strong job opportunities and it's
0:48
shaping the future of various industries. But despite the global boom in product management with 22 million
0:54
job openings worldwide, the situation in India is quite different. Surprisingly,
0:59
India only has about 20,000 product managers. This huge gap highlights a critical shortage of talent and it's
1:06
mostly because many people aren't even aware of what product management is. This lack of awareness creates a big
1:12
opportunity for those who want to build a career in product management. Companies across industries from tech
1:18
giants to startups are searching for skilled product managers to lead their product strategies, design user focused
1:24
solutions and drive business growth. So what exactly does a product manager do? A product manager is like a bridge
1:30
between teams working with engineers, designers, marketeers and stakeholders to bring an idea to life. They define
1:37
what the product will do, ensure it solves the right problems and oversees its journey from concept to launch. In
1:43
other words, product managers ensure the product delivers value to customers. The good news is that you do not need to be
1:50
from a technical background to become a product manager. Skills like communication, leadership, critical
1:55
thinking, and the ability to understand customer needs are just as important. Many successful product managers come
2:02
from diverse fields like marketing, sales, and even journalism. If you are a creative individual at core, you should
2:08
try and become a product manager. And this is exactly what this full course on product management is going to help you
2:14
achieve. By the end of this course, you will have all the important metrics, frameworks, tools, and strategies that
2:20
will help you lead some of the top cutting edge products being built out there. Now that we're clear with the agenda, let us look at the very first
2:26
topic on our list. First, we'll start with understanding what is a product and we'll also look at its type. Next, we'll
2:32
look at what is product management and how it evolved over the years. Then, we'll explore the levels of product
2:38
management like associate product manager, mid-level product manager, and other senior positions. Then we'll look
2:43
at what a product manager does and the skills required to become one. Next we'll look at the difference between
2:48
terminologies like product manager, product management and program management and also the difference
2:54
between roles like product manager versus business analyst. Next we'll cover the best practices in product
2:59
management like continuous market research and collaboration across teams. We'll also touch on tools for product
3:05
managers. Uh the popular ones being Jira, Trello, Figma and analytics tools like Google Analytics. Moving forward,
3:12
we'll understand the product life cycle and the strategies and product portfolio management which helps prioritize and
3:18
balance multiple products to maximize the business impact. Then we'll focus on understanding product features and
3:24
prioritization. From there, we move to designing and evaluating product features and specifications ensuring
3:30
that they align with customer needs and business goals. Next, we'll look at product line extension and modification,
3:37
portfolio management, and value creation. Moving forward, we'll look at Porter's value chain analysis, which is
What is Product Management?
3:43
a great tool to break down activities that contribute to delivering value effectively. Finally, we'll wrap up by
3:49
measuring value delivery effectiveness. Metrics like customer satisfaction, retention rates, and ROI that help
3:55
evaluate how well the product meets its goals, getting you ready for the real world opportunities. Moving on to how to
4:01
start your journey in product management. It's not a straightforward path, but it's definitely rewarding.
4:07
Over the last two decades, there's been a lot of buzz around product psychology. Think back to the early 1900s when
4:14
industrialization was just starting. The challenges back then were basic things
4:20
like transportation, communication, and utilities. A few companies stepped in to solve these problems. And because the
4:26
market wasn't too competitive, just providing a functional solution was often enough to succeed. But as we
4:33
evolved, so did our needs and expectations. The business world grew rapidly. And with that came intense
4:39
competition. Companies weren't just solving basic problems anymore. They were competing to meet more
4:45
sophisticated consumer demands. Products needed to be userfriendly, innovative, and aligned with what customers wanted.
4:53
This shift made product management crucial. As markets became crowded and consumers became more discerning,
4:59
product managers ensure that products not only worked but also resonated with users. It's about figuring out what
5:06
customers really want and make sure your product meets those needs. Let us look at one such amazing case study. Ben
5:13
Silverman, an ex Google customer support developer, created an app called Tote in
5:18
2009, which was described as catalog for the phone. His aim was to transform
5:23
every cell phone into a clothing retail outlet with this one app. Toted consumers with dozens of retailers and
5:30
allowed its users to catalog their favorite items. Tote would then send out an alert to the users whenever any of
5:37
the cataloged items was on sale so that they could make a purchase. However, the
5:43
outcome turned out to be a little different than what Ben expected. The users instead of making purchases
5:48
through the app used it to share the collections with each other. But Ben did not look at it as a setback. Rather, he
5:55
recalled how he collected insects as a kid and loved sharing his collection with others. He thought of implementing
6:01
something like this in Toad as well. And just like that, Pinterest was born and became a very big hit very quickly for
6:08
one main reason. It allows users to pin whatever they're interested in and add it to their personal collection. The way
6:15
users actually wanted the app to function. Interesting, right? Now, let us understand what a product is. A
6:21
product can be just an idea that can be presented to the society or market. For example, let's go back to the 4,000
6:28
B.CE. When the concept of the wheel came into existence, it reshaped the entire
6:33
way people looked at transport and solved the issue of carrying heavy goods from one place to another. Or look at
6:39
the good and works printing press which transformed the entire mode of communication. Or a product can be an
6:46
item like the shampoo, fruits, vegetables, electronics, clothes and hundreds of other goods available in the
6:51
market. Last category of a product is in the form of a service. Be it your food delivery or a haircut you get at the
6:58
saloon, it all comes under services. Even the applications on your devices are all services. Now that we know the
7:05
clear definition of a product, let us understand product management. Product management deals with multiple fields in
7:12
a business and it is quite difficult to come up with a definition for product management. At the very core, product
7:19
management is something that is needed to meet the gap between what the customer wants and what is technically
7:24
and operationally possible. Product management helps to discover a product that is valuable, usable, and feasible.
7:33
Martin Ericson, founder of product tank, defined product management as the intersection between functions of
7:39
business, technology, and user experience. He further stated that a good product manager must be experienced
7:46
in at least one and passionate about all three. In order to build the right product and build the product right,
7:53
product management can be mainly categorized into three steps or phases. First is product strategy which is just
8:00
thinking about what to build. Here is where the customer's need and demand is considered so that the product is
8:06
successful and generates revenue. Next comes the development phase where the product is brought to life and then
8:13
finally the marketing of the product which is very crucial as it deals with how to promote and sell the product. So
8:20
in a nutshell, product management is an aspect that ensures that the customer gets the desired product or the outcome
8:26
that was asked by him or her while also keeping in mind the business goals and objectives or what a product manager
8:33
does. Based on the organization size, specific responsibilities of a product
8:38
manager differ. For instance, in larger organizations, product managers often
8:43
have the support of various teams like marketing, engineering, design, and sales to help bring a product to life.
8:50
However, with more help comes the challenge of ensuring everyone is on the same page. Hence, in such cases, the
8:57
product managers spend more time aligning these stakeholders behind a specific vision. But when it comes to a
9:04
small organization, a product manager is required to do more of the hands-on work that comes while defining the vision.
9:11
Let us take a closer look at the roles and responsibilities of a product manager by taking an example of a
9:17
fitness app. The core of product management is understanding the end users, their challenges, goals, and
9:24
preferences when it comes to managing their fitness routines. Say the product manager figures out that users want
9:30
personalized workout plans. Next, you analyze the current market, examine popular fitness apps to understand what
9:37
features they offer, the pricing models, and user reviews, and notice that competitors lack detailed nutrition
9:43
tracking, a gap that could be filled. Keeping this in mind, you define the product vision, an app that combines
9:50
personalized workout and nutrition, something that aligns with your company's goals and also fills the
9:55
market gap. basically answering the question, what are we building and why?
10:01
Next, the product manager aligns stakeholders from engineers to marketing and even sales. Around this vision and
10:08
ensures everyone understands the goal. To keep the project on track, a product manager prioritizes features, deciding
10:15
that personalized workouts are a must-have for the first release, while advanced nutrition tracking will come
10:21
later on. Once the product which is the app in our case is built, tested and
10:27
released in the marketplace, the performance of the product is constantly monitored and the feedback is collected
10:33
and implemented in the next release after the discussion with the concerned parties.
10:38
Now that we know the major roles and responsibilities of a product manager, let us see the different types of
10:44
product managers in an organization. Digital product managers drive the
10:49
strategy for web- based products. They focus on creating seamless user experiences.
10:55
Product marketing managers usually have a strong background in marketing as they delve deeper into market research,
11:02
ensuring products resonate with target customers and they implement go to market or the GTM plans. Growth product
11:10
managers specialize in amplifying business expansion by harnessing product features as sales tools. This job role
11:17
is for someone who is intrigued by the idea of scaling business. Technical product manager is someone who has a
11:23
technical background and even though his or her job role is similar to that of a generic product manager, a technical
11:30
product manager is able to contribute more to the engineering team and is a hands-on part of the projects.
11:37
Data product manager focuses on data collection, processing and analysis to
11:42
support decision making within the company. Before we dive into the theoretical aspects of product
11:48
management, let us look at some frequently used key terms. The first term we have is MVP which stands for
11:55
minimum viable product. It is the simplest version of a product that you need to build to sell it to a market
12:01
with the least amount of risk and investment. The goal is to validate the product concept and learn from real
12:08
users before investing in a full-scale launch. Next is MBI or minimum business
12:14
increment. This focuses on delivering the smallest feature updates or improvements in the product that
12:20
positively impact the business rather than releasing all the features at once. And then we talk about MMF or minimum
12:27
marketable feature. We're referring to the smallest chunk of functionality in a product that delivers real value to
12:34
users and can actually be marketed or sold. It's a feature that's fully developed and ready to be released on
12:40
its own. And lastly, we have the MMR, minimum marketable release, which is
12:47
essentially the smallest version of a product that's ready to hit the market. It's more robust than an MVP or MMF,
12:53
aiming to meet market needs right away while leaving room for future improvements. I hope you guys are clear
12:59
with what product management is and the work scope of a product manager. Moving on, we will be coming up with more

the field of product management. We'll try to cover introduction of product management as a module that's the module name. So overall what we are
13:53
going to learn is what what is the meaning of product? What are the different types of product? What is the
13:58
meaning of product management? uh how product management as a profile evolved over a period of time. Next point is
14:04
hierarchy in product management domain. Uh number five, why product management you know why why product management is
14:11
so lucrative? Why people it is one of the attractive profile in in in current
14:17
times. Uh we'll understand product management roles and responsibilities.
14:22
Uh we'll understand what are the skills required to become a product manager. Uh there are a lot of questions you know
14:28
people are not very clear about uh what is the difference in roles and responsibilities of product manager
14:34
versus project manager versus program manager. Uh so detailed I have a couple of slides which explains the differences
14:40
in the roles and responsibilities. Okay. Then we will try to cover service product management. So I just want to
14:46
highlight here that product management is not specific which is product based companies but we have this kind of roles in service based organizations also. So
14:54
that I will cover uh product management in service based industries. Uh as we know we will come to know we
15:01
will discuss basically product manager will work with multiple cross functional teams. So I would like to give you a
15:08
brief idea about which are all those cross functional teams and what is their roles and responsibilities. So you are
15:13
crisp and clear basically what product manager do does what other other functions supposed to do. Uh 11 we'll
15:20
try to understand what are the best practices in product management. Uh 13 we will have detailed slide on what are
15:26
the different tools product manager we will be using in day-to-day operations. Uh we will not go in detail today we'll
15:33
just try to understand uh the tool names and its application. However in the respective module uh we will have
What is a Product and its Types?
15:38
hands-on experience for those tools. And last I created one uh case study about
15:44
uh how product managers drive growth in tech startup. First one, what is product and its type? What is the definition of
15:50
product? Product is anything that can be offered to market to satisfy uh customer want, customer need. It could be a
15:57
physical item, it could be a service, it could be a digital solution created for consumer or a business. So overall in a
16:04
product your service is also kind of product. service. Okay, we have service in separate industry. But in overall
16:10
definition of a product is basically something which we are going to offer to the market to satisfy a customer need or
16:17
customer want. And again the types of products you have physical products where you know it is tangible you can
16:22
see you can touch, you can feel such as you know electronics, furniture, food,
16:27
clothing you know smartphone, cars, home appliances. There is another category of product which called which call it as a
16:32
service. services. Basically, these are intangible offerings that provide value through experience or results. You know,
16:39
you have consultancy services, banking services, healthcare services, transportation services. This falls
16:45
under service product. Then you know physical product can be further categorized into or the service product
16:51
can be further categorized into digital product. So these are the products which are available in digital platform or
16:56
virtual or software based products that can be downloaded, accessed and used online. for example mobile applications
17:02
software and uh software as a services. So I think now we are migrating towards
17:08
uh license based uh softwares towards uh software as a service. We will have a
17:15
detailed discussion on what is SAS what is pass in in next modules but all these
17:20
things comes under digital products streaming services. Then we have consumer products you know typically uh
17:26
these are used by retail customers product that designed for personal or household use shampoo groceries all the
17:33
things what typical example is example is HL. So if you happen to work in Hindustan uni liver you will be a
17:40
product manager for couple of uh products which are used in household uh
17:45
consumer applications. Next one is industrial products. So products that mean business operations and
17:51
manufacturing most of them are like a B2B segment if you are selling if you are making a machinery and typically you
What is Product Management?
17:57
are selling it to other business to manufacture the products. So again you are in B2B segments and these products
18:03
are machinery you might sell raw material you might sell office equipments. So this is the top level
18:09
information top level you know definition and categorization of uh products.
18:14
Let's try to understand what is product management. So product management typically referred as a PM is a
18:21
professional profession responsible for guiding the success of a product and leading the cross functional team that
18:26
is responsible for improving it. So product manager is a person who is responsible for that product right from
18:32
ideation till end of life till its retirement and so he is the single point
18:38
of contact for the product. He is the single owner to make all the decisions on that product. So very very critical
18:43
role you know he has to basically he uh he is basically bridge between customer
18:49
business technology and user experience. So if you see this image rightly represent the role of a product manager.
18:56
Product manager is central entity on one side you have users and customers. So you will work with the marketing team to
19:03
understand the customer requirements. You will ensure that you have you will work with the design and technology
19:09
team, engineering team specifically and UIUX team in order to convert those customer requirement into engineering
19:15
specification into different different prototypes and you will be approving those prototypes and you will create a a
19:20
diff uh a proper product and parally you will have business level objectives you
19:26
know how much revenue your company is expecting from that product. So a third dimension for a product manager is
19:33
business. So users and customers, your engineering team, technology team and business team. So product manager is
19:40
bridge between these three entities and as I told he's the single point of contact to make a decision on that
19:45
product. So very very critical role, very very visible role in the
19:50
organization. So you you can see you know engineering team you might have 100 people working in engineering team but
19:57
if you see a product management vertical you will have almost not more than 10 or 15 product managers. So that kind of uh
20:03
roles and responsibilities and criticalities exist for product management profile. Uh right side image if you can see what are the stakeholders
20:09
I'll be covering them in next slides. So just to the to give the glimpse. So he works with the corporate strategy. He
20:16
will based on that he will decide the product strategy. He will work with the product delivery team. So he'll work
20:21
with the sales marketing team, accounts team. uh he'll work with the customer service team, finance team, business
20:28
leaders, engineering team and uh he'll ensure that uh product meets the target
20:34
what has been written and approved in product vision document. Product vision document is basically the backbone of
20:39
the product. Basically before you start developing the product uh you'll have detailed document a product manager will
20:44
create that is called as vision document. I will share you the template and we will have kind of couple of assignments on how to create a product
20:51
vision document. Just to give you the glimpse that uh in vision document we talk about uh why company's launching
20:56
this product uh who is the target customer what kind of uh revenue return on investment is expected out of this
21:03
product what what what kind of customer success criteria is there so how do you call product as successful in terms of
21:10
uh customer perspective so what are the KPIs are there which will consider product as a successful and all those
Evolution of Product Management
21:17
things are written and then it is product manager's responsibility to ensure that product meets all those KPIs
21:23
if not product manager is answerable for business heads why the things are not going well and what's the mitigation
21:29
plan okay so let's try to understand evolution of product management just to
21:34
understand you know how how it is evolved so evolution product uh management has undergone significant
21:40
evolution over a period of time I think adopting to changing market dynamics technological changes customer
21:46
expectations uh couple of milestones I think what I can got from web are uh pre-industrial
21:53
era when products were uh handcrafted. You know there were uh there was no formal concept. There was no profile
22:00
like a product management. It was only uh how well you can craft the product. Everybody was working on on shop floor.
22:07
Basically industrial revolution uh wherein you know machines came into the picture mass production era product
22:13
began to mass production due to advancement in manufacturing process. I think at that time your Ford came up
22:19
with the first automotive automotive line for revolutionalizing the product efficiency. So they came up with
22:25
assembly line structure concept. So where focus was on standardization cost reduction cost reduction sorry limited
22:31
customer focus priority was uh producing as many products as possible as at lower
22:37
cost. So productentric approach with minimum feedback loop from customers. So
22:42
in fact in industrial revolution also cost was a major concern rather than customer needs. So they were having a
22:49
standard products which were catered to all the customers. There was no customization. So things got changed
22:56
after I think uh 1930 after 1930 1935 where in you know PNG you might have
23:02
heard about this company they introduce this concept of brand management to
23:07
differentiate the product and target customers effectively. So brand manage
23:13
man managers were responsible for positioning the product in the target in the target market focus on product
23:18
differentiation and market strategies and still heavily productcentric but um
23:25
they started actually at least working by focusing on customer segmentation and customer requirement. So PNG was the
23:31
first one who kind of uh paved the foundation for product management kind of role in the industry tech and
23:38
software boom you know net and all what we have seen in 1980s 2000s you know with the rise of tech industries product
23:45
management started focus on software and digital products agile development methods started emerge focusing on quick
23:52
iteration flexibility continuous delivery customer feedback loop became integral part of product development
23:58
with the more emphasize on u UX User experience not user interface. It is only experience. The role of product
24:04
managers evolved to include cross functional collaboration, prioritizing customer needs and datadriven
24:11
decision-m. So that's what started from 1980s wherein there was a single point of
24:16
contact who was doing all those activities but also he was not known as product manager. So he was kind of
24:23
responsible. It was more or less towards product ownership not management. He was like working as a product coordinator.
24:30
Actual development and evolution had happened after 2000 where in agile and
24:35
lean era came into the picture. Product management adopted agile and agile and lean startup methodologies focusing on
24:42
uh continuous learning, iteration and uh quick product launches
24:47
with MVPs minimum viable products. product managers became more uh customer
24:53
centric using data analytics and customer feedback to iterate and refine the products and during this time I
25:00
think we started customizing the products also so geography specific customization
25:05
you know based on customers willingness to pay so if you look at the automotive also after 2000 you can see there were
25:12
uh multiple variants you have top variant mid variant low variant so like that based on how much customer budget
25:19
is you are creating a customized product but again customization was limited for couple of options. The focus shifted to
25:26
solve the real customer problems to iterative and release and testing you have I think uh instead of waterfall you
25:32
started using agile methodology. So whole product project work is divided into small small packets and then you
25:39
started uh development testing feedback parallelly. So cross functional teams
25:44
and collaboration across design, development and marketing become a key. But again started with the software
25:50
industry and uh currently if you see the datadriven product management the rise of data analytics, artificial
25:56
intelligence has made product management even more uh important and more scientific product managers are now use
26:03
data to make a datadriven decisions. Uh lot of personalization happening. All
26:08
products you take personalization is key nowadays. How well you can able to make
26:14
p products more and more personalized for end customers is the key and you are
26:19
optimizing the products. Emphasis on using data to track product success you know user behavior performance metrices
26:25
key performance indicators product management today is highly iterative fastpaced customer centric blending
26:32
strategy user insights and innovation. So that's where currently we are in where in u but again I'm telling you
26:39
there are a couple of industries still there those those don't have product management profile. So in automotive
26:44
also yesterday also I think I repeated this message in automotive look at the conventional companies like Tata
26:50
Mahindra force uh they don't have product managers they have product line
26:55
head they have chief engineer kind of profile but again chief engineer is uh more or less inward facing is not uh
27:04
looking at customer needs for customer needs they have product planning team so product management profile is divided
27:09
into multiple uh domains and accordingly automotive is currently working. But however, if you look at the Ola's
27:15
organization, you know, Ola Electric uh or Aether Energy or those people who are
27:20
in battery management system, those startups now, they have this product management profile. So, in software
27:26
industry, you will see a lot of uh product management profiles. In uh e-commerce industry, you know, Flipkart,
27:33
uh Walmart, Amazon, these profiles are there and slowly slowly these profiles
27:38
are getting penetrated into core and manufacturing industry as well. So and
Levels of Product Management
27:43
because of AI and ML and all those technologies, this is becoming inevitable that there will be a need in
27:50
each of the industry for product manager who is focused on customer needs and one particular product at a time to maximize
27:57
the revenue generated for that product. So let's try to understand what are the
28:02
levels of levels in product management domain. So it starts with associated associate product management we call it
28:08
as APM. It's kind of entry- level position for uh new product managers uh
28:14
often uh recent graduates or basically those who are transitioning from other roles who have I think less than 3 years
28:21
of experience. So what are their responsibilities? Assisting in gathering and documenting product requirements,
28:27
conducting market research, competition analysis, supporting you know the senior product manager or product manager in
28:34
the road map development and prioritization collaborating with the development teams on uh minor feature
28:39
enhancement and learning the fundamentals of product management through mentorship and hands-on
28:45
experience. So this is more or less support role for uh product manager. One level up associate product product
28:52
manager. One level up is product management. Uh it is called as a mid uh level position for individuals with
28:58
which has some years of experience. I would say four to five years of experience. You are eligible for four to
29:04
five years of experience in product management you are eligible for PM role. So responsibilities are defining and
29:10
managing product road map, product vision, conducting in-depth market research, user analysis, uh gathering
29:16
and prioritizing product requirement, working closely with engineering, design, marketing, sales team to deliver
29:22
the product features, monitoring and analyzing product performance and user feedback and ensuring the product aligns
29:29
with business goals and customer needs. So essentially all the skills what we are looking for uh are part of PM role
29:37
wherein he will work with engineering team, marketing team, sales team, product vision document, go to market
29:42
strategy. He might mentor the junior product associate product manager but that falls under people management
29:47
skills but mostly uh all product managers will not have any reporties. Mostly it is individual contributor
29:54
role. So let's see what goes ahead. So next one is senior product manager position. You know it is uh 8 8 to 10
30:01
years of experience guys typically uh advanced level position for experienced product managers with the proven track
30:08
record uh they are leading the product strategy and road map for one or more products. So it might happen that senior
30:14
product manager might handle more than one product. So they manage complex and high impact product initiatives. So kind
30:22
of uh continuous improvement programs in order to improve the product efficiency.
30:27
And they he might along with uh working on new generation products they might be responsible for improving the
30:34
performance of existing products reducing the cost for existing products creating a customization. They might
30:40
also work on you know launching the existing product into new geography uh mentoring and guiding junior product
30:45
managers and associate uh product managers engaging with the key stakeholders and executives to align
30:51
product vision and company strategy. So he will have some visibility about uh
30:57
company level strategy. So previous roles like they are limited to product vision and they have to create product
31:03
vision. They will work with product line head in order to get the approval for product vision document. But these guys
31:08
senior product manager will have some visibility about what is happening on organization level. what is organization
31:14
vision, organization mission and he basically uh will develop a in detail
31:21
vision document uh driving product growth through datadriven decisions, innovations, ensuring that successful
31:26
product launches and ongoing improvements. That's the roles and responsibilities for senior product
31:32
manager position. Then it comes lead product manager typically 12 to 14 years
31:37
of experience uh leadership position in senior product managers with increased responsibility over multiple products or
31:44
significant product area overseeing the product strategy and executing the for
31:49
product portfolio. So he has good about good amount of visibility about overall
31:54
product portfolio. So you have within the product portfolio you will have multiple products. So he will ensure
32:00
that he will develop a strategy for product portfolio and accordingly that
32:05
will get cascaded down to individual product vision and individual product strategy leading cross functional team to ensure cohesive product development
32:12
and delivery. So he will ensure that all product development all products are in sync establishing and promoting best
32:18
practices in product management within the team. So he is expected that lead product manager will will improve the
32:25
current processes the way in which uh I think good processes for product management. So this could be the
32:32
contribution from the lead product manager who will continuously check you know is there any area to improve the
32:38
current processes. So it is their responsibility. They will set setting
32:43
and tracking the key performance matrices for product success. So they will have the close eye on the KPIs for
32:50
product portfolio as a whole working closely with senior leadership to align on product initiatives with company
32:56
goals. So as I told he will have some visibility at uh senior level. So that's
33:02
what lead product manager will do. Then uh the highest position as individual
33:08
contributor is a principal product manager. He is considered as a subject matter expert in product management
33:13
area. Expert level position focused on high impacted strategic initiatives across the organization.
33:19
Responsibilities driving strategic product initiatives that have broad implications for the company identifying
33:27
and exploring new market opportunities and business models. So again he will look for uh market defense uh
33:35
opportunity defense level strategies. How can you leverage existing product into a new geography, new segment,
33:42
leading large scale of product development efforts, cross functional projects, serving as a thought leader
33:48
and expert within the product management community, providing deep expertise and mentoring to other product managers that
33:54
is the principal product manager. So up to principal product managers uh you these profiles are individual
34:00
contributors. You might not see any uh direct direct reporting. So for example
34:06
in lead product manager or senior product manager they might work as a mentor but that is kind of a a stretch
34:12
goal for them in order to groom the junior product managers but you hardly see you know any direct reporting for
34:18
this this kind of profiles. A first level comes where it is a group product manager wherein you know it is a
34:24
managerial position overseeing a team of product managers and uh suit of product.
34:30
So responsibilities of uh mostly managing and mentoring the team of product managers, overseeing product
34:36
strategy, execute execution of our group of related products, ensuring alignment
34:42
of a product goals with overall business objectives, uh facilitating communication and
34:47
collaboration across product teams and other develop other departments, reporting to senior leadership on
34:53
product performance and strategic initiatives. So most of these uh group product managers work will go I think
35:00
30% will go in people management area administrative stuff but also uh what he
35:05
will do is that he will have good visibility about um overall departmental strategy organizational strategy and
35:11
accordingly he will pass that information to respective uh leads in that product management
35:18
domain but he will have direct reporties. Group product managers typically reports to a director of
35:24
product management. Uh you know it is the executive grade. I would not consider group product manager as
35:30
executive grade. Director of product management is the first executive grade in product domain. A senior leadership
35:35
position responsible for overall direction and performance of a product management function. Typically if you
35:40
ask me years of experience uh I have hardly seen any director of product management who has less than 18 years of
35:47
experience. So most of the directors are 18 plus years of experience in product management. Setting a strategic
35:53
direction for product management organization. So leading the development of a team product managers and group
35:59
product managers. So he will decide uh what are the new product lines we are going to launch. How to develop
36:05
structure for uh group product managers lead product managers. He will ensure
36:10
that alignment of a product strategies with business goals and objectives. So he will have good visibility of what
36:16
where is the business going? what leadership is looking for and accordingly he will set the goals
36:22
managing budgets resources allocation for product initiatives he'll be uh
36:28
responsible for budget allocation so product management whatever tools are
36:33
required if he wants to hire anybody he will have control of all the budgets for example in fact product related
36:39
decisions so if you have to for example product manager if I own a particular
36:44
product and I want uh uh marketing team to
36:50
work on sales marketing strategies and they need kind of some budget. So product manager will come to director of
36:55
product manager with a proper business case. So in order to improve the revenue
37:01
I need to spend so and so marketing budget. So I need uh so and so marketing budget. Would you please approve? So
37:07
it's the director of product manager is the one who will approve the budget. So most of the time of director product
37:13
management you'll spend on uh budgeting related things getting a proper justification for uh the budget
37:20
requirement from a group product managers and all. He will report to vice
37:25
president of product management VP of product. It is executive level position responsible for entire product
37:31
management division and responsibilities are defining the vision and strategies for product organization overseeing the
37:37
development and execution of product road maps across all product lines. So he he will have visibility of multiple
37:43
product lines. What is the road map for each product line? Ensuring alignment between product strategy and the
37:48
company's overall business strategy. So what company wants, what business wants
37:54
and what basically accordingly he will basically strategize the product
37:59
organization. Uh leading and mentoring senior product management leaders, driving product innovation, long-term
38:06
strategic planning. Typically VP will create a strategy for uh 3 to five years
38:13
and accordingly directors and juniors are executing that product strategy
38:19
representing the product management in executive leadership team. So he is representing
38:24
in all the C staff wherein you have CEO, CTO, CPO, vice president, VP of product
38:31
manager reports to uh chief product officer uh highest level position in product domain. Uh top executive
38:37
position responsible for overall product strategy, direction and at the highest level of uh company. Responsibilities
38:44
leading the entire product management organization. Uh setting the overarching
38:49
product vision and strategy for the company. Uh driving product innovation and ensuring competitive
38:54
differentiation. He will have a close eye on what competitor is doing and accordingly he will pass that
39:00
information that okay we need to be better than our competitor and accordingly he will ensure that uh all
39:06
those things are captured in vision document which will ensure that our products are differentiated with
39:11
reference to competition and we have all the goals properly captured in vision
39:18
document aligning product initiatives with companywide goals and vision working closely with CEO and other uh C
39:25
executives which is CEO, CTO, COO in that and CDO also nowadays co is also
39:33
very common chief data officer executives to drive business growth uh representing product organization in the
39:39
board of directors level. So there was a question from whom I think it was
39:45
somebody had asked the question on uh CPO roles and responsibilities. What's
39:50
the core difference between lead senior and lead? Senior product manager and
39:55
lead product manager. So there is good amount of overlap. However, uh lead will
40:02
have multiple senior product managers. So lead is you know one level upper hierarchy. If you look at lead's core
40:09
responsibilities overseeing the product strategies and execution for product portfolio. So most of the times lead is
40:15
focused uh on product portfolio basis. However, senior product manager is
40:21
focused on product line basis. So you have product portfolio within that portfolio you will have multiple product
40:27
lines and each of the product line has multiple products. So senior has a visibility on product line basis. So
Why is Product Management Important?
40:34
he's responsible for one of the product line and however the lead have the
40:40
overview of overall product portfolio and that's that's basically differentiates lead versus senior. So
40:46
let's so let's try to understand uh why product management. Okay. So pros and pros of a product management. So as I
40:54
told you you will get exposure to multiple disciplines engineering, marketing, sales, uh business
41:00
development, operations, finance. So that's one way you will be working with
41:06
multiple disciplines. You will be able to uh have very high impact because you are
41:12
the single point of contact for that product and you are ensuring that all its objectives which are written in
41:18
product vision document are on track. So just look at it you know what kind of criticality is there on of this role in
41:24
the organization. So very very critical role very very high impact role. I would
41:29
say that product management is the profile it is very good opportunity to for skills development. So continuously
41:37
you'll be working with different different domains. So you know those technicalities you will over a period of time you will understand you know uh lot
41:44
of things from each of these domain. And I'm telling you most of the CEOs are
41:50
from originally they are work they worked as a product managers. So if you take at uh any CEO there is high
41:58
probability that CEO might have previously worked as a product manager because product manager is the profile
42:03
wherein he will have understanding about what is happening overall in the organization in different different uh
42:10
domains. So I'll consider that uh it is very good opportunity for product managers for developing their skills and
42:17
that's where you know all the CEOs uh positions will get filled career growth
42:23
you know as I told it is very very lucrative position very very high impactful position that's where you know
42:29
you'll get uh lot of visibility from higher management and uh every year you'll get lot of opportunities on um
42:37
making your product as a successful and if you can able ble to make it as a successful you know all those things in
42:44
it will get uh replicated in your annual appraisals you know incentive plan your
42:52
rsus and all those things cash bonus and all those things it will get uh replicated so career growth wise uh
43:00
remuneration wise very very good role so that's the pros of product management
43:05
again I think uh the two questions what you know what is the challenges for uh freshers or freshers I not say future
43:11
those people who are experienced but not from product management experience is requirement requirement for experience
43:16
you know let's take case of you know somebody who has 8 years of experience 10 years of experience and they want to
43:22
move to product management but they don't have prior knowledge of product management and why would I you know as a
43:28
recruiter why would I recruit somebody who doesn't have any experience and teach him from from the basics so that
43:35
is one of the challenge getting into product management is bit difficult if you don't have any prior experience
43:40
Second challenge is very very high responsibility. You know you will not have uh it is not
43:47
very it is not 10 to 5 job to be honest. You know typically if you are working as
43:52
a product manager in multinational companies wherein you have your you need to collaborate with the design team in
43:59
let's say in US or UK you have operations somewhere in Southeast Asia you have to work uh 24 by7. So very very
44:08
hectic job profile high responsibility cross functional coordination basically
44:13
as I told you know couple of most of the time you know if you are working in MNC some of your stakeholders are present in
44:19
different geography and uh you'll have late night meetings
44:24
you have to work early morning meetings and becomes very hectic your family time
44:29
will go for a toss not happens in all the organizations but it happens for many of the organization so these are
44:36
the challenges And uh first point you know experience requirement. So let's take case of most
44:41
of you you know you guys have some years of some years of experience not in product management. How can you migrate
44:47
to a product manager? So I'll say as a first step you have to learn the basics
44:52
of product management. So what are the skills required to skills and competencies required to become a
44:58
product manager? You should have those skills. That is the step number one.
45:03
Second uh develop soft skills. So for examples you'll see since product
45:09
manager is working with multiple stakeholders you have to be you should be a good with people you know you
45:15
should have all the soft skills you know how to talk to people how to conduct meetings how to lead CFT meetings how to
45:22
manage meetings how to organize meetings you know before going for a meeting share the agenda after the meeting share
45:29
the minutes of meeting share you should have you should be very systematic person with a very good documentation
45:35
skills So at the end of the meeting you should pass on the action items do the followup with the people and if you see you have
45:42
to work with engineering marketing team and nobody's reporting to you. So you have to pursue
45:49
the guy who is from different domain who is not reporting to you and you have to ensure that he is giving you right
45:55
information. So you have to be you have to have very good soft skills. You should be good
46:00
with people. Build a portfolio. That's where I think so learn the basics. So that basically
46:06
this this course will ensure that you have all the skills required to become a product manager. At the end of the
46:12
course you have during the course basically you'll be working on multiple case studies multiple projects which
46:20
will essentially you should add it in your resume which will define that you have hands-on experience on all those
46:26
skills and basically you are developing a portfolio in your resume on your LinkedIn profile that okay I have those
46:33
skills and I have hands-on experience by which I utilize those skills in order to develop a product and launch a product.
46:40
So as a part of this course we have I think uh a food delivery application which is like you will be a product
46:46
scenario is you'll be a product manager for a food delivery application and you supposed to develop a product vision
46:52
document go to market strategy UI you have to ensure that UI is on track UX is on track. So all those things you should
46:59
uh all the projects what you are doing as a part of this course you should add it in your profile which will justify
47:05
that you have the core skills and hands-on experience as a product manager. But is that sufficient? No.
47:11
Next thing which we will be doing is networking. So at the end of the course, I will be telling you what are the
47:17
different uh product management communities are there. I would ask you to enroll and join those communities,
47:24
create your network, uh understand what kind of discussions happens in that uh
47:29
uh portals and I'm telling you only 30 to 40%age of the opportunities will get
47:36
published in LinkedIn. Most of the opportunities are not even available in any of the portal neither
47:43
in company portal. So I would say once you cross 8 to 10 years of experience if
47:49
you are looking for higher positions networking is the key. I know based on my experience you know mostly we prefer
47:57
a guy who is referred by a internal employee. So networking is very very important. So with the help of those
48:03
product management communities you'll get uh exposure to different different product managers. You have to create a
48:09
good network. Go to LinkedIn. Start uh creating a good repo of yours. Try to
48:16
create a LinkedIn post which will justify that you have all the skills and competencies. Market yourself. Create a
48:24
profile for yourself. You know, don't uh leave any of the opportunities. Let's
48:30
let's post one particular you know um article related to product management on LinkedIn because nowadays the recruiter
48:37
will look for your review the LinkedIn profile before they shortlist you. So creating a good networking is very very
Product Manager Roles and Responsibilities
48:44
important and last gaining the relevant experience very very important. So as a part of this course you will get to work
48:51
on uh realtime projects. So that is one part of experience. So let's let's see
48:56
what are the core roles and responsibilities. What are the must- have skills? First one first and foremost uh defining product vision and
49:04
product strategy. So it is product manager's job to develop a clear product vision document that aligns with company
49:10
goal. So company has its own vision and that company's vision will be cascaded
49:15
down to a product level vision. So product manager is the one who captures that vision. A vision will have multiple
49:22
components. We have we'll have a detailed assignment and hands-on experience on how to create a product vision and what are the components but
49:29
on top level it talks about what is this product why companies launching this product what is the target market what
49:35
kind of uh product development lifestyle basically what are the major milestone in product development what kind of
49:41
revenue is expected out of this product revenue expected means again details at the end of first year how much revenue
49:47
is expected at the end of second year how much revenue is expected what is the return on investment
49:52
What is the overall cost for this product? Customer success criteria. Okay. What are the top features of the
49:58
product? All those things will be jotted down in the product vision document. And product manager is the author for
50:05
product vision. He it is not like that. He will go and individually you know he will write all those things. He will
50:11
work with the marketing team to understand the customer requirement. He will work with engineering team to understand how much resources required.
50:18
He'll work with the finance team in order to give overall prospect about
50:23
okay what is the cost required how many resources are required in order to develop that product. He'll also get
50:29
informed um finance about what kind of revenue is expected out of this product. So all those things are captured in the
50:35
product vision document. The core responsibility of product manager is drafting a product vision document.
50:40
understanding have a clear understanding about what are the components, how to get those components and how to create a
50:47
a clear vision document because vision is the backbone of the product. Point number one. Point number two, create a
50:54
strategic road map to guide product development and growth. So how you will create a proper product road map. Okay,
51:01
road map will have different different things. Okay, it could be product development road map. So what are the milestones in which month in which
51:08
quarter you are expecting? what maturity of the product a road map could be a revenue variable road map you know in
51:15
which quarter how much revenue you are expecting it could be a market penetration related road map you know in
51:21
first year I I would like to for example let's take example of a food delivery application so product manager might
51:27
write that okay in first quarter I will look for only Bangalore city customers
51:33
in second year I'll target Bangalore plus Mysore in third year third quarter I'll try I'll target you know whole
51:40
couple of more tier cities in adjacent states. In fourth quarter I will target
51:45
some more cities across India. So like that you'll create a proper road map. So as a product manager you should be able
51:51
to create a road map and those road maps are should be justifiable those should
51:58
be realistic and those should be basically uh a datadriven. So all the decisions what product manager will take
52:05
those should be data driven. So why did you decided that by end of this quarter you should be you are going to capture
52:12
so and so revenue. What is the basis? How can you justify that statement? So you should be able to create good road
52:18
map which are justifiable and you should be able to justify it with the proper data backup. So case I did so and so
52:26
market search with reference to so and so I have done you know this kind of data analytics model and then I based on
52:32
that I have some these are the assumptions and based on that I created this particular milestone in the road
52:37
map. So the core responsibility is driving vision document creating a project road map. Second one conducting
52:45
market research gather and analyze market data to understand customer needs. So marketing team is there who
52:52
will conduct the market you know he will work with customers but it is product manager's responsibility to analyze that
52:58
data which is captured by marketing team and come up with the insights okay what is exactly customer need okay this is
53:06
customer requirement but can we how can we categorize that customer requirement is it a must have is it a should have it
53:12
is a good to have accordingly he will convert those requirement into features and then accordingly he will in he
53:20
Prioritize those features. What are the must- have features? What are the should have features? What are the good to have
53:25
features? So, as a product manager, you should be able to analyze marketing data and to understand customer needs.
53:33
You as a product manager should have a good understanding about marketing trend and competitive landscape. So overall
53:40
how market is going forward overall your top customers what customers are doing
53:46
it and again for each of these line items you have you'll have some resources. So there are couple of
53:51
agencies who will give you you know overall marketing trends. So your
53:57
company will have the subscription but it is your responsibility to go through those browers to understand how things
54:03
are going on. Product manager typically attends all those uh industry
54:08
conferences and he will check what are the new trends are coming who are all the new suppliers how can we leverage new
54:15
suppliers what else we can do in your existing portfolio in order to improve the performance reduce the cost or and
54:22
basically at the end you're trying to differentiate your products and you're trying to create competitive advantage for your product.
54:29
So you should have a good understanding about uh marketing things, marketing
54:35
trends, competitive landscape, use insights to uh to inform product
54:41
decisions and priorities. Yeah. So at the end basically do the analysis and get those insights. You'll have you'll
54:47
create a hypothesis. You'll do the hypothesis testing again. You'll go to customer for checking whether your
54:53
hypothesis is correct or not. But based on those datadriven decisions, hypothesis, you are going to make
54:59
product level decisions and that should justify should be justifiable. So that
55:05
is the core roles and responsibilities. Next one, planning and prioritizing.
55:11
Defining product features. As I told, you know, capturing marketing requirement is one thing, but how can you convert those marketing requirement
55:17
to product features? How can you prioritize those features? And again, you know, always there will
55:24
be a conflict between marketing team might say okay, I want this feature also, this feature also, that feature also. But again, you have a limited
55:33
resources. resources could be uh budgeting related resources. You have given a budget like 10 million. You
55:40
can't use more budget. You have so and so developers. Okay. Engineering team told that for this product you have only
55:47
three developers, one project manager. So that's what is available. So you don't have infinite resources. So that's
55:53
where prioritization comes into the picture. So how well you prioritize it? how well you understood the customer
56:00
requirements and based on that you decided that okay I would like to launch feature one first because that is more
56:06
important than feature two which is kind of less impact so you should have the good understanding about features and
56:12
its impact on the end customer how much value you are adding to the end customer so that's what it talks about define
56:18
features prioritize them into business value and customer impact create and manage product backlog so which talks
56:25
about okay what are those features Again it is it falls under road map category. So you'll have core features which you
56:31
would like to launch in the first and accordingly you have subsequent features as a backlog and then accordingly you
56:38
should launch it in the next versions of product. Ensure uh overall product plan
56:44
product road map is aligned with overall product strategy. So you have to ensure that always there is a correlation
56:49
between planning versus product vision document. Vision talks about overall what is expected from the product and uh
56:56
your prioritization planning should justify that okay if you do all those things you are going to achieve what is
57:02
written in the vision document. Number four, stakeholder management. Communicate effectively with stakeholders. What are the stakeholders?
57:09
Okay. Developers, designers, marketing team, sales team, executives, engineering team, what not? You know, we
57:17
have detailed slides which are all the stakeholders, product manager we work with. But essentially you'll work with
57:22
engineering team, operations team, higher management team and you should be communicate effectively and you should
57:28
have a good stakeholder management skills. You should be good with people. You'll create a first draft. You will
57:34
have a lot of concerns from engineering team, designer team, marketing team. Then you will talk to them. You will
57:40
negotiate couple of things. You will raise a second version document. Again there are some concerns. So like that it
57:47
is iterative process. So as per my experience to develop a good vision document it will take minimum two to
57:53
three months. So product manager will will will work closely with each of these teams and basically you will draft
58:00
a vision document and get the alignment. Drafting is only one month of job. Getting the alignment will take a lot of
58:05
time. There are lot of concerns and there are a lot of conflicts between different different teams and then you
58:10
have to manage those conflicts. Yes, last point suggest that manage expectations and ensure that all parties
58:16
are aligned on the product vision. So that's the core responsibility of product manager. So that's where you know I was telling your documentation
58:22
skills will come into the picture. Lot of things you have to handle. So that's where you know whenever you are trying
58:27
to schedule a call for vision alignment you have to go with the proper preparation. Whatever is discussed in
58:32
the last meeting cue the minutes of meeting what you are going to discuss in this particular meeting. Create a very
58:38
clear agenda and at the end of the meeting if there are some action items clearly document minutes of meeting who
58:43
wants what do the follow-up ensure that all things are on track and then go for next version next iteration so that's
58:50
the core skill of work management stakeholder management let's go to next one leading the cross functional team
58:57
collaboration with engineering design marketing so you are doing the stakeholder management but you are the
59:02
lead in that CTF meetings cross functional team meetings so as I told you know all the leading skills is
59:07
ensuring that meetings happen smoothly. You get alignment with all those things. Foster collaborative and productive team
59:13
environment very very important. Most of the time you might happen that there is a heated discussion in the room and it
59:19
is very difficult to get consensus from different different parties. That's where your soft skills will come into
59:25
the picture. How well you can uh navigate that situation and how well you can get the alignment is very very
59:32
important. Ensure timely delivery and high quality products. So that's what is
59:37
the expected next one execution and delivery oversee the product development life cycle from concept to launch. So
59:44
you will have weekly reviews bi-weekly reviews monthly reviews with engineering team during the development phase. So
59:50
they will show the progress you that's where you know I was telling you should have the minimum skills in engineering
59:56
domain so that you can ask right questions to engineering team. If engineering manager says okay I need one
1:00:02
resource in order in order to develop this this particular feature for two months you should be in a position to
1:00:09
ask him the right questions you should be in a position to uh check whatever he
1:00:15
says is realistic or not so that kind of minimum knowledge is required monitor product performance and iterate based on
1:00:21
the user feedback analysis that's where you know KPIs will come into the picture. So in the vision document you
1:00:26
have the KPIs okay product should perform in this particular way. So all you have you you have performance
1:00:32
targets you have financial targets you have budgeting related targets. So
1:00:38
always you have to keep uh that's where you know we develop lot of dashboards. Product management is all about
1:00:43
developing dashboards. You create a dashboard for financial KPIs. You create a dashboard for product performance
1:00:48
related KPIs and you will closely monitor if things are on track or not on track. If things are not on track, it is
1:00:55
your responsibility to ask right questions to respective stakeholder and ensure that things are on track and you
1:01:01
are on track when it comes to product vision document. Ensure product meets quality standards and business goals. So
1:01:08
again it is with reference to quality KPIs and business goals. And last but
1:01:13
not least analyzing data and matrices. So all seven are must have but one very very important thing what product
1:01:20
manager should have. You should be good with numbers. Every day you will get uh Excel spreadsheets so much of data. You
1:01:27
know you should be able to convert that raw data into a insight and uh
1:01:33
accordingly you should be able to justify your decisions. You should be just you should be able to justify your
1:01:38
argument with different different stakeholders. All the decisions what you are going to take will be questioned by
1:01:44
each of the stakeholder. So you should have solid data backup. So to make that data backup you should be good with
1:01:50
numbers. So once you have Excel spreadsheet data you have 5,000 rows immediately you should be able to
1:01:56
understand okay what does this data tells. So for one first week of every month you'll get revenue data. So
1:02:03
immediately you should be able to understand and do the data analysis and check okay whether you are doing
1:02:08
good with reference to last month or whether you are not doing good with reference to last month. what kind of forecasting you did in last month and
1:02:16
where you know just check forecasted results versus actual results and accordingly you should be able to
1:02:22
correct forecasting methodologies and if things are not going well you should be able to pinpoint okay revenue is not
1:02:29
going well why revenue is not going well okay I'm last month I had so many
1:02:34
customers from this particular geography but it has found that for this month data this particular geography has I'm
1:02:41
getting lower revenue So let's go one step lower why we are getting less revenue on that geography
1:02:48
whether customer consumer behavior has changed or what are the things or let's check what competitor has done in that
1:02:55
month is competitor revenue increases increased so that means whatever customers I lost those have been
1:03:02
converted to went to competitor basically so why did
1:03:07
you know uh customer left my platform and went to competitor so that kind of analysis you should be able to do it by
1:03:13
looking at the data you should be pretty good with numbers use data to make informed decisions drive continuous
1:03:20
improvements report product performance to stakeholders you know KPIs dashboards what that's these are the things I told
1:03:26
okay guys uh is the roles and responsibilities clear so these are the core responsibilities of a product
1:03:32

1:04:03
course can set your career to new heights. So visit the course page link given below in the description and take
1:04:09
the first step towards career growth in the field of product management. So let me start with the uh skills
1:04:15
required to become a product manager or skills uh which are the skills which are mandatory for a product manager. So the
1:04:21
first one is I think as we discussed time analytical thinking product manager is the profile who is going to make a
1:04:28
decision on your product. So he should be good in analytical thinking. So what
1:04:34
does that mean is ability to analyze market data, ability to analyze user
1:04:39
feedback and most importantly make datadriven decisions to improve product performance, improve product revenue,
1:04:46
you know reduce cost, improve basically the competitive adv competitive advantage for your product. So very very
1:04:52
core skill you should be good at analytical thinking. You should be good with good at numbers. So most of your
1:04:58
time almost 60 to 70%age of time you'll be working with numbers. You'll be analyzing the numbers. You'll be using
1:05:05
different differenth methodologies in order to come up with the insights from a given data and uh quickly if you can
1:05:12
able to analyze those numbers, come up with hypothesis, prove your hypothesis, I think that will be a added advantage
1:05:18
for you. So analytical thinking is a core and the most important skill for a product manager. In fact, I will give
1:05:24
more importance than stakeholder management. Number two is communication. As is as we discussed you know in roles
1:05:31
and responsibilities product manager needs to work with the different different stakeholders right from marketing team for understanding the
1:05:37
customer requirement you know to engineering team in order to develop a product to sales team in order to uh
1:05:43
launch the product work uh generate leads for for the customer trying to
1:05:48
understand the customer feedback he'll work with the manufacturing team he will work with the supply chain team so he
1:05:53
should be good at communication there are multiple topics in fact we have one module If you I don't know there is uh
1:06:00
one module particularly one phase particularly about uh analytical decision making uh there we are going to
1:06:06
cover how to come up with a datadriven decision m making by using different different tools. So there in that module
1:06:12
we will cover uh the details about analytical thinking. scope of work is just to understand top level what are the skills required to become a product
1:06:19
manager and as and as and when we go to the next modules I think uh we'll go
1:06:24
much uh one level deeper two level deepers okay so communication a clear
1:06:29
and effective communication with all the stakeholders ability to articulate product vision and strategy as I told
1:06:35
you know product manager is the one who is the owner for vision document product vision document product defining the
1:06:41
product strategy so he should be able to articulate no what he has he has done a
1:06:47
detailed analysis accordingly he has come up with a product vision document and then he should be able to articulate it and he should be able to sell that
1:06:53
product vision to the respective stakeholders and get their alignment writing a detailed product requirement
1:06:58
and documentation so he'll get a top level requirement from marketing team but in order to convert those u
1:07:06
marketing requirements into uh at least system level specification he is a job of product manager so he should be able
1:07:12
to create a a detailed product requirement documentation and again there are different tools and
1:07:17
methodologies we are product manager is going to use he might use um a Trello he might use a Jira in order to effectively
1:07:25
create those requirement documents but having said that he should have some knowledge some domain knowledge of the
1:07:30
product so by understanding the customer requirement document he should be able to create uh different different features and then he should be able to
1:07:36
pass it on to engineering team for product development so that is two communication second one uh third one is
1:07:42
about of the leadership as I told uh in previous section. So product manager is the one who will lead different
1:07:48
different crossunctional teams we call it as a CFTS. So leading and motivating cross functional teams is very very
1:07:54
important. you know fostering collaboration and driving the team productivity uh is also important
1:08:00
because you are the host you are the organizer for those CTF meetings you are leading those CTF meetings you have to ensure that everybody is participating
1:08:06
everybody is sharing their feedback and meeting managements you know you should be able to keep a track of how many open
1:08:13
points are there what has been discussed in the last meeting what you are planning to do in the next meeting where are the minutes of meetings are stored
1:08:19
who owns what action item by when things are due so all those things you should be able to manage it You should be able
1:08:25
to lead those CFTs handling the conflicts and managing decisive decisions very very important. Every
1:08:32
features every step what product managers will do they there will be a conflict between different different
1:08:38
stakeholders. So marketing team will be telling I need so many features engineering will tell I need so many
1:08:43
resources but again at the end of the day you have limited budgets limited resources limited time in hand in order
1:08:49
to launch product. So considering all those things you should be able to resolve the conflicts. So how to resolve
1:08:54
the conflicts? Number one just analyze the features from customer impact perspective. And there I think in third
1:09:01
or fourth model we are going to use some frameworks called as a Moscow model wherein we are going to prioritize the
1:09:06
features based on must have should have good to have and then you should be able to prioritize and accordingly you should
1:09:13
be able to use available resources in order to develop high impactdriven
1:09:18
features. So that's how you should be able to handle the conflict resolve the conflict. Number four, problem solving.
1:09:24
Quickly identify and addressing the issues. Let's take example, you know, you are the product manager. Product is already been launched and uh monthly you
1:09:31
are going and talking to sales team. Okay, I would like to understand the customer feedback about the product. So
1:09:37
he will give Google reviews. He will give multiple reviews. But quickly you should be able to analyze that data
1:09:42
because the reviews content is very high. So you should be able to analyze the you know those reviews. You should
1:09:47
be able to check what is the major issue customers are facing on your product or
1:09:53
top five issues and basically you should be able to come up with the strategy in order to improve your next iteration of
1:09:59
your product. So problem solving is very very important. You should be able to quickly understand the problem statement
1:10:04
from customer side and you should be able to come up with a proper strategy in order to resolve that issue. Developing innovative solutions to solve
1:10:11
complex problems and navigating trade-offs and prioritizing the task. Again it goes back to conflict
1:10:17
resolution prioritization wherein you will have multiple perspective from different different stakeholders. You will have multiple priorities. You
1:10:23
should be able to create the proper right priority for your product and you should be able to accordingly drive the
1:10:29
product development and issue resolution. Again all the decisions what you are going to make let's go back to
1:10:35
number one analytical thinking. All the decisions what you are going to make should be based on a solid data backup.
1:10:40
So that's where you know while you are prioritizing this particular feature you should have a backup data. Why you are not prioritizing this particular
1:10:46
feature? You should have backup data. Even though customers are you have lot of customers on one particular feature
1:10:51
but still you decided that not to work upon uh improving that or resolving that issue rather than you have given
1:10:57
importance to something else. You should be able to justify with the data. So problem solving is also another core
1:11:02
skill for a product manager. Number five, market and user research. Understanding customer needs and market
1:11:08
trends. You know you should have overall perspective about what is happening in your market, what competitors are doing,
1:11:15
overall weather market uh how basically what is the direction in which market is
1:11:20
going, what is the trend of a market. So you should have a good understanding about overall market perspective and you
1:11:27
should be able to conduct competitive analysis. Again marketing team will be there in order to do all those things.
1:11:33
But you should be able to again they are they are the one who will who will give you the information but you should be able to conduct leverage that
1:11:39
information and come up with the solid insights about what is your competitive analysis. Who are your who are all your
1:11:46
core customer core competitors primary competitors? Who are all your secondary competitors? A competitor A is good at
1:11:52
what? Competitor B is good at what is what is the SWAT analysis for competitor A? SWAT stands for strengths, weakness,
1:11:58
opportunities, threats. So you should be able to conduct SW analysis for competitors. You should be able to conduct SW analysis for your product.
1:12:04
Translating research insights into actionable product features. As we told uh uh marketing team will give customer
1:12:11
uh requirements. However, converting those customer requirements into a proper features, it is the responsibility of a product manager. So
1:12:17
you should be able to understand those customer requirements and convert them into features and prioritize those
1:12:23
features based on customer impact. Number six, technical knowledge. understanding technical aspect of a
1:12:28
product development. So basically if I am not from engineering background, I am from some different background. How much
1:12:34
engineering competencies I should be able to having to become a product manager. So this is one of the core
1:12:39
skills required for a product manager. You should have a bare minimum competencies in your domain. So that you
1:12:45
should be able to talk effectively with engineering team. You should be able to understand and convey first of all what
1:12:51
is customer expectation from the product and you should be able to ask them the right question whenever engineering team
1:12:56
is going to come up or showing you some timeline. Okay, I need so many resources. I mean I need so much you
1:13:02
know kind of uh timeline is required in order to develop a product. You should be able to ask them right questions.
1:13:08
Balancing technical constraints with business goals. So this is last one is very very important. So you should be able to balance technical constraints
1:13:15
and business goals. So both things should go hand in hand and you are the one who is going to manage both the both
1:13:21
the dimensions. Last one but not the least strategic thinking. So you should be able to have a long you should be
1:13:28
able to develop a long-term product vision and strategy. That's one of the core skill aligning product goals with
1:13:33
the business objectives because on a on a organizational level you have a clarity what organization wants to do in
1:13:39
future. accordingly you should be able to create the product vision which aligns with company vision and
1:13:45
anticipate uh market changes and planning accordingly. So most of the
1:13:50
time it might happen that you have developed product vision document product development is almost started or
1:13:56
it came to a m matured state and then because of so and so reason things got changed because of you know
1:14:03
microeconomic factor because of some customer priorities have been changed because technology has been changed then
1:14:09
you should be able to understand the impact of that change on your product and accordingly you should be flexible
1:14:15
enough to adopt those change on your product vision and product development. So strategically you should be able to
1:14:21
think and you should be able to adjust your uh end goal accordingly if the things are changing on the way. Let's
1:14:28
take uh let's take a second bullet of strategic thinking aligning product goals with business objectives. So let's
1:14:35
take any organization and uh as a product manager you should be able to understand where company wants to what
1:14:42
company wants to do in near future and accordingly he should be able to uh develop the next generation product
1:14:48
which aligns with company's objective. So maybe to make it more clearer talk about let's talk about your organization
1:14:55
and then let's take that case study in order to make this concept more clearer
1:15:00
and uh let's take example of uh in order to achieve that company's vision if
1:15:05
today if if you are a product manager for your organization if you want to develop a new product uh I'll basically
1:15:11
elaborate that case how you can able to capture some things which can able to of
1:15:16
in your new new generation product which can able to help company to to basically achieve its long-term vision. Good. So
1:15:23
let's take as a anti-diabetic. uh so your company's long-term vision is you know uh develop some products which are
1:15:31
which falls under anti-diabetic criteria and uh because they see a huge market
1:15:37
potential you know India is known for uh diabetic capital of the world and that's
1:15:43
where you know company wants to develop a new generation product and now today if you are a product manager and if you
1:15:48
have an opportunity to uh develop a new generation product in that case you
1:15:54
should be able to if you can able to target this particular use case as uh anti-diabetic developing a or maybe if
1:16:01
you can uh okay let me take it if you can able to enhance your current
1:16:07
generation products which are in anti-diabetic category and if you are developing uh advanced product which can
1:16:14
enhance the capability of current generation products which are in anti-diabetic category it aligns with
1:16:19
your company's long-term vision and with that one you you you know a probability
1:16:24
of uh becoming your product as a successful is more so that that that
1:16:32
could be one of the use case I can tell. So you should strategic thinking basically you should have a long-term perspective about what what where
1:16:39
industry is going where your organization wants to go and accordingly you should be able to develop your
1:16:45
product vision documentally you should be able to understand okay what are those areas if I can capture in my
1:16:51
product vision document how can I create a bigger impact on organizational level what my organization wants to do and
1:16:57
accordingly how can I capture some things in my product which helps organization to achieve its objectives
1:17:02
those products which company has never made it before and first time they are making it. So that's the basically
1:17:08
difference 20 to 30% is only NPDS are there. Most of the cases it is carryover. How it is independent things
1:17:14
you know CTC when you work in India is very very different as compared to when you work in emerging markets like a
1:17:20
Philippines or if you directly work in offshore. Okay. So CTC is very very different as compared to you know how
1:17:25
many opportunities you have desperately organization is looking for. So that is independent V. What is the overall value
1:17:32
or what is the overall budgeting required for a software engineer if you want to hire him for monthly basis?
1:17:39
These are more or less very standard and basically that defines the budget required for overall product
1:17:44
development. So I think both are independent. Uh let me hold you there itself. Program manager will come into
1:17:50
the picture mostly you know when the actual product development will start when the features are finalized you know
1:17:56
all the things are developed and then you have program manager I have overall information for example I need to
1:18:01
develop so many features and have I have so many uh basically so much budget
1:18:07
available and then right within that budget how to allocate how many resources that is what you are
1:18:13
telling program manager but I'm talking about at the time of developing a vision document what is the overall budget
1:18:18
required for product development top level and one of that component goes to engineering and that will be taken
1:18:25
forward by a program manager. I think that's what we are going to discuss next slide. We have a lot of I think questions regarding what program manager
1:18:31
does, what project manager does. I think that's what we are going to cover in the next slide. Uh but to answer your
1:18:37
question, we are talking about product manager roles and responsibilities. We are talking about budgeting for a product development
1:18:43
and that happens on the during the vision finalization overall budget is been finalized. One of the component
1:18:49
goes to engineer and then it is program manager's responsibility is that he will conduct the product development within
1:18:55
the initially allocated budget. So that's kind of you know execution part of it. But I'm talking about strategic
1:19:01
part of it when basically at the at the beginning itself what is the budget required in order to develop a product
1:19:06
and you know why that is important because I think once you get actual once you get a hands-on exper experience on
1:19:13
actual product vision development you'll understand because your vision should justify the return on investment. So budgeting talks about how much company
1:19:20
is investing in order to develop and launch this product. In vision you should you will have the information about your expected revenue. So how much
1:19:27
revenue you are expecting in first year in second year in third year. So at and basically your vision will include what
1:19:34
is the u uh Q point basically what is the point at which uh you are start
1:19:39
after how many years you will start actually making profit break even point they call it as so what is your break
1:19:44
break even point what is the overall return on investment so all those things are included in the vision document so
1:19:50
what you're talking about is execution part what I'm talking much before you know at vision document at strategy
1:19:56
level in fact you know uh you should have the thought process So you are mentioning only two dimensions. One is
1:20:02
the marketing dimension about the operations. I would say you will you have to use couple of more dimensions
1:20:10
like engineering dimension also you have to use from customer satisfaction perspective also I think you'll get more
1:20:15
clearer understanding when it comes to product vision document once we have start I think working on product vision
1:20:21
format template what are the component it involves I think uh huh that's where you know your uh so okay customer
1:20:29
because you know marketing team told you that I have so many customer requirements you as a product manager
1:20:34
has convert clustered those requirements into feature one, feature two, feature three, feature four and based on your
1:20:40
analysis, you have prioritized those features. So since you have a limited budget, you decided that couple of
1:20:45
features you are going to dep prioritize it. So that will have impact on customer satisfaction because you are not going
1:20:52
to fulfill couple of customer requirements. So what is the overall risk for your um uh product success when
1:20:59
you are eliminating those features because of having so and so constraints. So all those analysis you need to do it.
Product Manager vs Product Management vs Program Management
1:21:04
So that's what I was basically talk talking about customer satisfaction perspective because already you have understood okay customer has so and so
1:21:11
requirements and now you decided that you are not going to meet couple of requirements because you feel that uh you have limited resources so all the
1:21:17
features you cannot implement it okay so very very common questions what exactly
1:21:23
what are the difference between product manager versus project manager versus program manager just to bring the clarity about what exactly product
1:21:30
manager to so let's uh I I created I think three slides product manager then project manager program manager and then
1:21:36
I created a sideby-side difference just to get a very clear understanding so quickly go over product manager so
1:21:42
product manager is responsible for product strategy product road map product feature definition of a product
1:21:48
or a product line responsibilities a vision and strategy define the product vision define the product strategy and
1:21:53
direction of a product conduct market research to understand customer needs and market trends product road map
1:21:59
create and maintain product road map ensuring that alignment with the business goals So what you would like to launch uh
1:22:05
product road map basically how many versions of this product will be launched which version will be launched
1:22:10
in which time duration and it will have which features. So all those things will be captured in product road map.
1:22:16
Requirement gathering he should be able to understand the customer requirement. He should be able to convert them into a feature. Stakeholder communication as we
1:22:23
discussed he will work with multiple stakeholders you know uh including executives customers development teams. So stakeholder communication, feature
1:22:29
prioritization. Okay. Customer requirements into features and then prioritization and product life cycle
1:22:36
management. Oversee entire life cycle of a product from concept to retirement. And uh he should be able to understand
1:22:43
customer feedback gather analyze customer feedback completion. Accordingly you should be able to take appropriate action for solving the
1:22:50
product level problems. So this is kind of repetitive what we understood uh roles and responsibilities of a key and
1:22:57
key skills of a product manager. So now let me highlight a project manager. Okay. So project manager is very much
1:23:03
engineering focused uh profile you know uh so role is project manager is
1:23:08
responsible for planning executing and closing projects ensuring they are completed on time within the scope and
1:23:15
within the budget. So a common terminology is TCS within time, T for
1:23:20
time, C for cost within the budget and S for within the scope. So project manager
1:23:26
is all about uh ensuring that the project is within the TCS time, cost and
1:23:33
within the scope. What are their what are his responsibilities? A project planning develop a detailed project plan
1:23:38
including scope, objectives, timeline and resource allocation. Uh resource management, coordinate resources
1:23:44
including team members, tools, materials, budget management again resource management for the basically
1:23:51
resource for project level. Budget management again project level budget manage the budget project budget and
1:23:57
ensure that you know it is cost effectiveness. It is cost effective uh risk management. He should have a clear
1:24:03
understanding about what are the different risk on a project level and he should have a risk mitigation strategy.
1:24:08
He should ensure that the project is on timeline. Quality assurance ensure that the project deliverables meet the
1:24:14
quality standards. Stakeholder communication regularly comm communicate project status in issues success to a
1:24:21
stakeholder and overall he should make sure that the project has a proper documentation. So a product development
1:24:27
will have multiple feature development. Each feature can be developed with you
1:24:32
know just to give a top level information. A product can be developed by developing multiple features. Let's
1:24:38
take example of feature one. A feature one if you have to develop it needs um
1:24:44
it is basically the collaboration of multiple projects and a project manager
1:24:49
is responsible for developing one particular piece of that one feature. So you have product manager and then you
1:24:56
have project manager. Project manager is connected to a piece of one particular feature. So that's how you should be able to uh imagine where does the
1:25:03
product project manager fits and these are his RNRs. And last one is a program manager. Uh program manager is basically
1:25:10
role is program manager. He oversees the group of related projects a program to ensure that they are managed and
1:25:16
coordinated to achieve the strategic objective. Uh so group of uh projects is
1:25:21
called as a program. So a program manager program planning define a program structure including objectives,
1:25:27
scope of work, success criteria, alignment with strategy. Ensure that the program aligns with organization
1:25:33
strategy, goals and objectives. Uh resource coordination allocate and manage resources across projects within
1:25:39
the program. Interro uh coordination. So he should ensure that there is a synergy benefits between different different
1:25:44
projects which happens under his program. Ensure that project within the programs are integrated and coordinated
1:25:50
effectively. That's where you know uh the cost effectiveness will come into the picture. Can issue management
1:25:56
identify the manage identify and manage the risk and issue on a program level within the program. Performance
1:26:02
monitoring track and repeat of all different programs are projects are happening within that program. Stakeholder management mostly program
1:26:08
manager will coordinate with the uh only project managers and project manager will coordinate with the engineering
1:26:14
resources and it could be engineer, it could be software engineer. Benefit uh realization ensure that program delivers
1:26:21
intended benefit and value to the organization. These are top level features. Now let's see you know the
1:26:26
sideby-side comparison. If you if you take example of focus a product manager focuses on product success, customer
1:26:34
satisfaction and you know he should continuously thinking how can able to make a product which fits to the end
1:26:40
customer market fit. So this is what product manager's focus is. He is he is
1:26:45
always looking at the product from customer perspective and he's checking that how how can I develop a best
1:26:52
product which will fit the customer requirement with a way a project manager will focus on delivering the specific
1:26:57
project on timeline. So he's focused only on that particular project and he have to ensure that project is on time
1:27:03
within the scope and within the budget. So he's only focused on that particular piece of one particular feature. Program
1:27:09
manager focuses on strategic alignment and coordination of multiple projects. So okay how many project managers are
1:27:14
there under me? So I have five project managers. So I have to ensure that I can uh there is a good amount of synergy
1:27:20
between these five project managers and uh uh focus on strategic alignments and coordination between multiple projects.
1:27:27
So this is what the focus is. Second let's look at the difference from scope perspective. Project manager scope of
1:27:33
work is uh it could be a single product or m product line. Project manager he is
1:27:39
kind of typically project managers handles one project at a time and program manager he handles uh basically
1:27:45
group of projects. Outcome what is the outcome of product manager? Product manager ensures that product meets the
1:27:51
market needs and achieve the business related goals. Project manager's outcome is he will ensure that project is
1:27:57
completed successfully you know within the TCS what we developed time cost and scope. Program manager will ensure that
1:28:04
program delivers are intended at intended basically delivers its intended strategic benefits. What are the key
1:28:10
matrices for project manager? Product manager. Product manager matrices basically customer adaptation rate,
1:28:17
return on investment, revenue, customer satisfaction. So on product level or product level matrices you can see for
1:28:23
product manager. Project managers matrices are basically through like on-time delivery, budget, scope and
1:28:29
program manager is success through program matrices like overall return on investment alignment for a given set of
1:28:36
projects what he owns. Is the difference between these three clear? So we are talking about product manager, program
1:28:42
manager, program manager, these are engineering specific roles which happens in engineering domain. Program manager a
1:28:49
piece of one particular feature. Sorry, project manager is a piece of one particular feature and program manager
1:28:55
is the one who handles multiple project managers under him and he will ensure
1:29:00
that there is a good amount of coordination between different different projects. R&Rs between product program
1:29:07
and project is clear is there shall be several projects under one product. Yeah. Yeah. There will be multiple
1:29:14
projects under one product. So just to give you a hierarch uh within one product you will have
1:29:19
multiple features even um each feature will have multiple projects. A feature a
1:29:26
software part of feature will be developed by a software project manager. A hardware part of that project will be
1:29:32
developed by hardware feature. A UIUX of part of that feature will be developed by UIUX project manager. So you have
1:29:40
product and below that you'll have under the product you'll have multiple projects. So project manager role is
1:29:47
very very small. It has very limited scope. But product manager is very very
1:29:53
vast and he will he will have he will basically a single point of contact for that product. The project is a part of
1:30:00
product. What about program? So program is uh typically uh you know in the most
1:30:06
of the MNC's you have this role program manager. A program manager is kind of uh
1:30:12
leading a group of project managers. Leading a group of product uh project managers. So ensures that program
Product Manager vs Business Analyst
1:30:18
delivers sent in. So let me go to program manager again. Uh program managers oversee a group of related
1:30:24
projects a program to ensure that they are managed and coordinated to achieve the strategic objectives. Okay fine.
1:30:31
Mohead I think last time there was one question about what about BA business analyst. So earlier I was not having
1:30:39
this one uh BA related you know sideby-side comparison of product versus BA because both the roles are uh there
1:30:47
is some overlap but mostly they are very very indifferent. Uh so let me explain the BA related work
1:30:55
also since I think some of you as working as a BA. So BA's business analyst focuses on understanding the
1:31:01
business needs, analyzing processes, providing datadriven recommendations to improve the business outcome.
1:31:07
Responsibilities for business analyst is uh elicit, document and manage requirement from stakeholders. Ensure
1:31:13
that requirement aligns with the business objectives. Mostly focus on process improvements. Analyze the
1:31:19
current business processes. Analyze areas for improvements and purpose solution. Propose solution. Data
1:31:26
analysis. Gather the data uh data and inform business related decisions.
1:31:31
Provide insights based on data analysis. Documentation create detailed documentation including business
1:31:37
requirements. So BRTs we call it as functional specification user stories.
1:31:43
Maintain clear and organized records of a business processes. Stakeholder
1:31:48
communication. Felicitate communication between business stakeholders and technical
1:31:53
teams. ensure stakeholder needs are accurately translated into technical requirements. But again that particular
1:32:00
business I think next slide we'll talk about um side by side with reference to product solution assessment evaluate
1:32:07
proposed solutions to ensure they meet business needs. Conduct feasibility studies and impact analysis. Assist in
1:32:14
technical phase to ensure the requirements are met. validate solutions to ensure they resolve and identify
1:32:21
business problems and provide the training and end user on new systems or
1:32:27
processes. Offer ongoing support to ensure successful implementation. So this is I think will give more clarity.
1:32:33
So focus for BI is focus on understanding the business needs, improving processes and providing
1:32:39
actionable insights for one particular or one particular customer or set of customers. I would say he doesn't have
1:32:46
the visibility for all the customers. Typically, BA is for limited customers. However, product manager is single point
1:32:52
of contact for that particular product. Focuses on product success, market feed, and customer satisfaction. Scope of work
1:32:58
for business analyst is work on specific project or initiatives to analyze and improve a business process. So, he's
1:33:05
very much focused on one particular aspect of that business process. Responsibilities of a business analyst
1:33:10
involves requirement gathering, business, business process improvements, data analysis, documentation,
1:33:15
stakeholder communication related to business needs. One particular business needs for one particular customer.
1:33:22
However, product manager will have holistic um approach on all the customers and on all the aspects. What
1:33:30
is the outcome for business analyst? Ensure that business processes are efficient, effective, aligned with business objectives. Ensure product
1:33:37
meets the market and the product manager of uh you know outcome is whatever is written in the vision document you know
1:33:43
return on investment business goals customer uh how how many customers we
1:33:48
are acquiring all those things interaction with teams. So business analyst will closely work with that
1:33:54
particular you know project manager technical teams ensure that solutions are met for business needs and uh
1:33:59
product manager you know works with marketing sales development customer support basically what not most of the
1:34:06
stakeholders what we discussed in previous slides. So this is a top level difference between product managers and business analyst. So
Service Product Management
1:34:14
skill sets, roles and responsibilities 1 2 3. Okay fine. Uh small there is a
1:34:21
small module uh service what is you know typically do we have a product management profile for in service based
1:34:27
industry. So uh let's let's discuss that one and then we can so key aspect of a
1:34:34
service product management. So instead of product it is basically service. You
1:34:39
hardly see any difference you know you just have to look at instead of product you have to look at
1:34:45
from service perspective. So what he does service design define the service
1:34:50
concept. So he has to define service concept identify customer needs designing the service
1:34:57
process to deliver high quality experience. So instead of product he will have service perspective.
1:35:03
uh tat uh what is that Tamil turnar around time is that what how fastly you
1:35:10
can deliver the service turnaround time is uh one of the important uh KPI but
1:35:16
again you quality of the service also will come into the picture so there are
1:35:21
multiple KPIs for service side so design a key aspect market research similar to
1:35:28
product manager service product manager will do the market research from service perspective Analyze the market trends,
1:35:33
customer preferences, competitive landscape and inform service development and improvement. Service development.
1:35:40
Okay. Collaborating with various teams to create, implement new services or
1:35:45
enhance existing services. Customer experience. Ensure the service meets the existing customer expect or exceeds the
1:35:52
customer expectation. Pardon me. Addressing the pain points and enhancing overall satisfaction. Performance
1:35:58
monitoring. Again you have KPI similar to that of a product based companies.
1:36:04
You'll have KPIs for service based uh companies. One of the KPI what I'm all told is turnaround time tat
1:36:12
cross functional collaboration. Okay. Similar to product uh management for product based companies you'll have
1:36:20
similar stakeholders for service based product management profiles also. just
1:36:26
to give an I think some example for service based uh products.
1:36:33
So let's take example of healthcare. So you have the services called as a
1:36:39
teley health services. Tele health is what basically managing the development and improvement of uh telly health
1:36:45
platforms ensuring that they meet um patient needs. I think you must have okay one of the example is pract if you
1:36:51
know practto they have very famous application nowadays for health teley health services. So it is uh uh service-
1:36:59
based product management example wherein they will they have developed a platform wherein they have doctors onboarded and
1:37:06
accordingly they are giving different different services which caters to patient need and um healthcare services.
1:37:14
Then basically they have patient care programs overseeing the chronic disease management programs ensuring that they
1:37:20
provide comprehensive care and support to the patients. So these practto is
1:37:26
good example for healthcare which defines the service based product management profiles. You have multiple
1:37:32
profiles, product management profiles in service. when it comes to u finance uh
1:37:37
mobile banking you know uh mobile banking services developing I would say
1:37:43
a top of my mind you know you had uh product management profiles in PTM you
1:37:48
had a product management profiles for uh grow you had a product management
1:37:54
profiles for zeroda and you know multiple you know HDFCs and all those banks also they have product management
1:38:00
profiles mobile banking developing enhancing mobile banking applications, adding features like mobile check
1:38:07
deposit, all the features you know deposit, real-time notifications, personalized financial services,
1:38:13
investment services, managing uh robot advisory platforms that provide automated algorithmdriven financial
1:38:19
planning services with minimum human supervision, investment uh related.
1:38:24
There are a lot of apps you know investment based service which provides the investment based services and all those apps basically they need a product
1:38:30
manager. travel you know you know uh oo make my trip there are a lot I think is
1:38:37
my trip a lot of uh profiles are there which are focused which are focused on
1:38:43
service based product management uh what are their roles and responsibilities develop the app you know typically they
1:38:49
focus on loyalty programs designing and managing hotel or airline loyalty programs ensuring they offer uh valuable
1:38:55
rewards and experiences that enhances customer loy loyalty you So when it
1:39:01
comes to make my trip kind of uh platform wherein everything is all about
1:39:06
you know how can you differentiate your travel package. So you have there basically these are marketing tilted
1:39:15
product management profiles wherein you have to create more and more personalized travel packages
1:39:21
curating and managing travel packages including flight accommodation experiences ensuring seamless and
1:39:26
enjoyable customer journey. So in that kind of perspective they will look at it if you are if you happen to apply on uh
1:39:34
travel on hospital hospitality based uh product management profiles. But again these are the examples of service based
1:39:40
product management telecommunication you know again you have product management profiles for Jio
1:39:47
uh I think most of them are India Mumbai based location PMS I think uh couple of
1:39:55
months back I saw a couple of profiles were available developing and managing internet services packages including
1:40:02
speed uh tiers pricing additional services home Wi-Fi you know Jio now
1:40:08
they would like to combine everything mobile FTH geo fiber all those things
1:40:15
how can you create a big package of the services and who does all those things it's a product manager so who will look
1:40:22
at different different products and then accordingly they will define the features
1:40:28
customer support services enhancing customer support through chat boards so these are kind of couple of highle
1:40:35
things which product manager will focuses on in in respective industry.
1:40:41
Similarly, I can give example of education. You know, uh earlier uh I
1:40:46
think uh Baiju had lot of product management profiles but nowadays I think
1:40:51
Baiju is uh out of business now. Uh however I think um Udemy had uh product
1:41:00
management profiles wherein the product manager's job is uh do the marketing survey look at what uh what does
1:41:08
customer needs look at what competitors are doing and accordingly develop a more customized online e-learning profiles
1:41:15
e-learning courses managing and developing online courses learning platforms ensuring that they they are
1:41:21
engaging upto-date accessible to wide audience And they also provide focuses
1:41:26
on student services or single services such as uh career counseling,
1:41:32
academic uh advising, mental health support, ensuring they effectively support the student success. So if you
1:41:39
are in educational industry you happen to work on these are all the key features.
1:41:47
SAS software as a services uh collaboration tools. I think one of them what we are going to use work upon today
1:41:55
is um Trello Jira basically Atlassian uh Atlassian based uh Atlasian is
1:42:01
organization Trello is their tool they develop collaboration tool Microsoft tools Microsoft also lot of uh product
1:42:08
management profiles. So teams what we are going to use today is again their uh one of the product from Microsoft. So
1:42:15
those falls under SAS category which develops the collaboration tools. Again
1:42:20
we have CRM tools. Let's take example of Salesforce. Enhancing CRM system to provide better customer insights, sales
1:42:27
processes, improve customer services. These are kind of key things in SAS industry. You have product management
1:42:34
profiles in um Flipkart, Amazon, Walmart. So what are the things if you happen to
1:42:40
work in those industries? e-commerce platforms, managing the development and optimization of online shopping experiences
1:42:47
including web design, payment processing, delivery services. So if you happen to get a job profile in Walmart,
1:42:54
you have to develop a product which is focusing on ease of payment. How can you
1:43:00
enhance the delivery related services? How can you make your UI more and more interactive? How can you create more and
1:43:06
more loyalty programs for the end customers? subscription services or seeing subscription base models like uh
1:43:14
kits, beauty boxes, digital content, how can you make a packaged
1:43:19
deals for the end customers. So these are the things which happens currently happening in retail industry.
1:43:25
Transportation I think uh again it is part of go hand
1:43:31
inhand with I think uh travel and hospitality I would say uh red bus they also had a
1:43:39
product management profiles uh Uber Ola ride sharing services they also have
1:43:44
product management profiles managing platforms for ride sharing services focuses on okay so driver partner
1:43:52
supports you you you'll create a platform platform for divers you will create a platform for end customers and
1:43:58
accordingly you will develop your product at the end you are you are enhancing your transportation service
1:44:05
and you are trying to improve your competitive advantage in that market. So these are a couple of examples of
1:44:11
product management profiles in service based industry just to give you a glimpse. So we completed till 9. Okay.
1:44:20
So we completed this one. Now slide number 12 tips of freshers. Uh tips for
1:44:27
freshers or uh aspiring to become a product manager. Not only freshers basically
1:44:32
those who are outsiders. The first thing is you should understand you should
1:44:38
learn learn the basic things you should learn the skills and competencies to become a product manager. So there this
1:44:44
course will be helpful. develop a soft skills along with the core skills. You
1:44:49
should develop a soft skills. Third one is uh build a portfolio. So as a part of this course, you will get a good amount
1:44:56
of hands-on experience on uh different different um capstone projects wherein
1:45:02
you should be able to work as a product manager and develop a product vision document, develop a product go to market
1:45:09
strategy. Uh given a customer uh requirement, you should be able to prioritize the features. If you get a
1:45:15
customer feedback, you should be able to assess which feature basically which particular problem customer is facing,
1:45:22
you should be able to come up with a KPI. So all those case studies, we will be able to give it to you as a part of this course. Expectation is that you
1:45:29
will enhance your resume with reference to those projects what you are doing as a part of this course. Plus uh at the
1:45:36
end of the course, I will be giving you some communities which are specific to product management. expectation from
1:45:42
your side is uh you will join those communities, create your network, talk to them and uh again as a part of uh
1:45:51
this course I will tell you some freelancing opportunities wherein you can get hands-on experience on some live
1:45:56
projects from their side apart from what we are going to provide as a part of this course. So by doing all those
1:46:02
things what you are trying to do is that you are going to put more and more productive experience on your resume as
1:46:08
a product manager and if you do all those things you are basically enhancing
1:46:13
your employability for product management profiles. So that's my answer. It could be fresher or it could
1:46:20
be a people from different uh background. First one is learn the basics. Complete the coursework. I think
1:46:27
just we are in first module. I think uh at least uh 30 40%age course work you
1:46:32
understand and then start uh because I think once we complete 30 40%age of the
1:46:39
course work you can start upload updating your resume for example if we
Product Manager’s Role in Cross-Functional Teams
1:46:44
complete a product vision document for couple of products you can start uploading improving your adding those
1:46:51
those experience in your resume and start looking for uh opportunities.
1:46:56
So first step is gain gain gain those skills. So let's try to understand the
1:47:01
roles and responsibility of each of the stakeholder. We'll get a very clear idea. Uh I think uh if we go through
1:47:08
these couple of slides. So product manager role uh as we discussed it he oversees uh product life cycle right
1:47:16
from ideation to launch ensuring that there is a good alignment between business goals and customer needs. So
1:47:24
basically he will understand the customer needs. He'll create a product vision. He'll ensure that uh all things
1:47:30
are in place. So he single point of contact for that product right from ideation till it it is written as a
1:47:38
launch but actually till uh its retirement. So what are the roles and
1:47:43
responsibilities? Define product vision. Define product strategy. Create product road map. Prioritize the features.
1:47:49
Collaborate with cross functional teams. Development. Design marketing. gather and analyze customer feedback, market
1:47:55
research, track product performance. We we call it as a KPI matrices
1:48:01
uh iterate based on KPI and data. You know, you will understand that you'll
1:48:06
get the data, come up with the KPIs based on that you will decide the corrective action in order to improve
1:48:11
the product performance. If at all KPIs are not on track as defined in product vision document and essentially act as a
1:48:18
main point of communication between all the stakeholders. So all the decisions related to product will be given by
1:48:24
product manager. So is the single point of contact for that product. So product manager. So important stakeholder first
1:48:31
important stakeholder or product manage manager is engineering team. So what are their roles and
1:48:37
responsibilities? So engineering development team is responsible for building the product and ensuring that
1:48:42
it functions technically. So what are their responsibilities? Develop a code.
1:48:48
Develop and code the product based on technical specification. Again code is very specific thing. It is specifically
1:48:57
I think written for software product. However, it is applic engineering is applicable basically in order to ensure
1:49:04
that product is designed as per the technical specification. Provide input
1:49:09
on feasibility, timeline and technical risk. So product engineering team typically engineering lead he will work
1:49:16
closely with product manager during vision free phase and he will talk he will give information about if the uh
1:49:23
features are technically feasible or not. If yes how much timeline is required and what kind of technical risk
1:49:29
is associated collaborate with collaborate with product manager on design and
1:49:35
development priorities. Uh so engineering team will closely basically
1:49:40
engineering is a receiver you know wherein uh they will understand the
1:49:46
feature priorities and accordingly they will come up with a timeline and for approvals they will go to product manager conduct testing bug fixing
1:49:53
ensuring that the product release product is meets the quality KPIs
1:49:58
support product iteration and going updation uh basically and ongoing updates post
1:50:04
launch. So support you know iteration one, iteration two, iteration three and
1:50:10
basically after post-production if there are some quality issues you engineering team will support in order to resolve
1:50:16
those quality issues from technical perspective. So these are the roles and responsibilities of engineering team.
1:50:22
Third stakeholder in this whole journey is the design or UX team. So again I
1:50:27
typically they consider design or UX team separately as you know with
1:50:33
reference to engineering. However I consider uh if you look at them they fall under engineering domain but again
1:50:39
they have specific roles and responsibilities with reference to UI and UX but again these roles are very
1:50:45
much similar. They just their their focus is only on UIUX development. The role is ensuring that the product is
1:50:52
userfriendly, intuitive and visually appealing. Responsibilities, design, you
1:50:57
know, wireframes, design prototypes for UI and UX, user interface and user
1:51:02
experience, conduct usability testing, incorporate feedback into product design. So you
1:51:09
will have different different UIUX prototypes and then what you do is that you create those prototypes. You ask uh
1:51:17
selected end user you know terminology selected end user you release the UI to
1:51:24
them and you ask them okay please utilize it and let us know how do you feel it and based on that feedback
1:51:30
typically those UIUX themes are getting finalized. So they work closely with PME ensuring
1:51:37
uh ensure the design aligns with the product vision and customer needs and ensure that the branding and design
1:51:43
guidelines are followed. So this is what typically design and US team does it. So
1:51:48
engineering team also does the same thing but they do it for overall technical specifications perspective and
1:51:54
UIUX is specifically on uh user interface and user experience. And again if you look at a generic product
1:52:00
management role you know engineering role is limited to this one but uh if you look at typical software product
1:52:07
manager wherein you are talking about product as a software app then it comes you know UIUX team will have bigger
1:52:12
impact that's where you know we have separate stakeholder called as UIUX developer with which product manager
1:52:18
need to work closely with so that's the difference between engineering and UIUX.
1:52:23
Why UIUX is very important? Because the nature of the product most of the
1:52:29
product typically what we work is digital products. These are on our
1:52:34
screen mobile applications. That's where UIUX is important aspect when it comes to comput advantage. So that's where
1:52:42
UIUX is important. Okay. Number fourth one is marketing team. Okay. So what
1:52:48
marketing does? They create uh product messaging, marketing strategies and
1:52:54
ensure that successful product launches. So they are responsible. So they are responsible for basically in the two
1:53:00
phases. The first phase is capturing the customer requirement. You know they work closely with customers and customers.
1:53:06
They understand VC we call it as a voice of customer and then they
1:53:12
uh consolidate VC and then pass on pass that pass on that information to product manager for creating the features. But
1:53:18
that is just during the product vision finalization or feature finalization.
1:53:25
However, major chunk of marketing team lies during product launches. So
1:53:30
marketing strategy is developing you know one of the core roles and responsibilities develop go to market
1:53:35
strategy. How they would like to position the product, how they would like to brand the product, what kind of
1:53:40
message they would like to deliver. They'll collaborate marketing team collaborate with product management to understand the product features and
1:53:46
customer pain points. They will pass on okay this was the first page where they will pass on this information related to
1:53:52
customer voice of customer and customer pain points you know if there is a current generation product is already been released so they will understand
1:53:58
what are the customer feedbacks pain points are there and they will pass that information to product manager which
1:54:04
product manager ideally they they should enhance uh product features with
1:54:09
reference to old generation painpoint areas uh execute promotional campaigns including digital marketing content
1:54:15
creation social media Yeah. So marketing team is the one who decides which platform in which product launch will
1:54:22
happen whether either physical or digital if it is digital. What is the digital media? Whether social networking
1:54:28
website or some other platform if it is social networking website what kind of social networking website it's
1:54:34
Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn. Again depends upon what kind of target market you are looking for. But all those
1:54:41
things will be decided by marketing team. track the product performance post launch and adjust the marketing strategy
1:54:46
as needed. So they will use you know marketing strategy and they will check how effective is their marketing
1:54:53
strategy. So let's say example that uh we are going to talk about it Google analytics. Google analytics is the tool
1:54:59
which talks about you know let's say example you have created advertise for your product in multiple applications.
1:55:05
You advertise your products in product. You launched your product advertise in Facebook also. You launched your product
1:55:12
advertising in Instagram also. Uh Google analytics where which for which we are
1:55:17
going to get hands-on experience in later portion of this course. If you pass on the information for your u
1:55:24
customer leads, it can able to tell how many leads you got it from Facebook, how many leads you got it from Instagram and
1:55:31
based on that you can able to decide okay which platform is more effective and accordingly to decide the future
1:55:37
strategies you can make make use of that data based on assessing the performance
1:55:42
of existing product platforms product release platforms. So those KPI analysis and all will be
1:55:49
done by marketing team. Product manager will have the overview. However, the groundwork will be done by marketing
1:55:55
team. Sales teams, sales is basically selling function. Uh their role is sell
1:56:01
the product to the customer provides insights to customer into the customer needs and market trends. So understand
1:56:07
product features, benefits to effectively sell the product. They will understand you know top level features. They'll create a kind of ownersh own
1:56:15
owner product owner document, collateral document and they will use it for
1:56:20
selling the product to the end customer. Provide feedback to product manager on
1:56:25
customer reaction, objections and pain points. Since see marketing team is in
1:56:31
general about where does the market going and launching relate product launch which is not focused on any of
1:56:37
the customer. sales team have will have the focus on particular customer or set of customers. So that's where you know
1:56:45
um they will customer specific painoint information they will give it to us. However, what feedback typically
1:56:51
marketing team will give you overall marketing marketing technologies related. So you'll get a very generic
1:56:58
feedback from marketing team with when it comes to your product feedback from customer. However, you know, you'll get
1:57:05
specific feedback from sales team because they work day in day out on with the with a set of customers. So that's
1:57:12
that's the difference between getting the feedback from marketing team and what feedback you get it from sales team
1:57:18
assist in developing product strategies and sales material presentations, demos.
1:57:23
So they as I told they work closely with customers. So they are responsible for giving demos to the end customer,
1:57:30
showing the presentations, creating the manual documents and all those things. Support product launch by driving
1:57:36
initial sales and onboarding customers. So they also will be involved in initial sales and onboarding the customers. So
1:57:44
this is sales team. Number six, customer support team. Okay, you launch the product, you need to have customer
1:57:49
support team. So they serve as the frontliner for customer issues, providing feedback and support. So if
1:57:54
there are some issues, if customer needs some assistance while using the product, they are kind of um you can say customer
1:58:02
support uh numbers. Most of these guys are call center guys. They are like a
1:58:08
front face for the customer issues. So they handle customer queries, issues, feedback, report uh recurring issues,
1:58:15
customer pain points to the product manager for product improvement, assist with customer
1:58:22
onboarding and training and collaborate with product manager to create FAQs,
1:58:27
guide and support content for the customers. So they are responsible for typically the usage related issues from
1:58:34
end customers. So number four, five, six is about marketing team. On one liner if
1:58:40
I say marketing team responsible for giving input to product manager during vision document and at the time of
1:58:46
launching marketing team is very much involved during defining the go-to market strategy. Sales team responsible
1:58:53
for selling your product to end customer. They will closely work with end customer and uh they will sell the
1:59:00
product. They will show the demo, sell the product, all the selling related transactions,
1:59:05
financial entries, they are responsible and customer support team. Once the product is sold, if there are any issues
1:59:11
with reference to customer use, sorry, product usage and feedback, they are the front face for the customers.
1:59:18
Any questions? Four, five, six. It's very important that you understand uh
1:59:23
overall stakeholders and what they do and touch points with reference to product
1:59:28
manager. 7 8 9 uh seventh one is finance team. So it's our finance organization.
1:59:35
What what role they play? Oversee the product financial viability, budgeting and pricing strategies responsibilities.
1:59:41
Ensure that the product aligns the financial goals and objectives. Assist in setting the product pricing models
1:59:48
and revenue forecast. uh monitor and analyze financial performance, cost,
1:59:53
revenue, margins post launch and advise the product a product manager on
1:59:58
profitability and financial risk. So uh
2:00:04
the thing is uh during vision product manager will closely work with financial team. They can product manager will
2:00:11
closely work with financial team in order to uh define what kind of financial forecast is expected. So
2:00:18
basically uh when it comes to pricing the product, product manager will closely work with
2:00:24
finance team what kind of pricing methodology we would like to use, what kind of margins we should expect while
2:00:30
selling the product to the customer and uh so defining the product pricing
2:00:35
product manager will work closely with finance team and uh you know revenue numbers product manager will get it from
2:00:41
finance team. So finance will have overall information about your customer install base, how many customers are
2:00:47
there. Uh product manager will work closely once in a month at least. Uh he will get the revenue information from
2:00:52
finance team and with the help of those data analytics toolbox what we are going to use it. Product manager will check
2:00:58
okay how well product is performing financially and are we meeting the
2:01:04
financial related KPIs or not? If not you will collaborate with finance team and come up with the corrective action.
2:01:11
So monitoring cost, revenue, margin, financial KPIs all those things product manager will work closely with finance
2:01:17
team and as I told during pricing finance is very very important stakeholder for product manager. So
2:01:23
which type which methodology of price pricing methodology to be used a product manager will closely work with the
2:01:29
financial team and at the beginning overall you know what is overall budget required
2:01:36
how much budget finance team can able to allocate. So during vision finalization also product manager will give will will
2:01:42
work with finance team in order to get the buy in from finance team that okay this product will make financial sense.
2:01:48
For example product manager will say return on investment is 30%age. Finance team will have the overall objective
2:01:54
about what company looks after what company is looking for uh the financial
2:02:00
success from this product. So product manager will work closely with finance team in order to understand the expectation from finance. what is the
2:02:07
ROI finance team is expecting from the from the product in order to capture those details in vision document. So
2:02:14
financing legal and compliance team okay ensure that product is compliant with
2:02:19
reference to relevant regulations and policies. Review the product for compliance with industry standards
2:02:26
regulations assist in IP protection such as patent trademarks. Review contracts,
2:02:32
terms and services uh contracts, terms of services, primary policies, protect
2:02:38
the company, assist uh product management on legal risk and necessity necessary certifications,
2:02:44
certificates basically sorry certificates. So all legal related things you know you will closely work
2:02:50
with the legal team. Another use case you know wherein product manager will closely work with legal team is that you
2:02:56
have uh uh a generation one product is launched in one particular geography.
2:03:02
Now you would like to customize it little bit and you would like to launch that u customized product in geography
2:03:08
2. But here you will closely work with legal team and you will ask okay what kind of um government related
2:03:14
regulations are there in new geography which needs to be incorporated in order to launch the product in that geography.
2:03:20
So accordingly legal team will do that survey. They will understand all the things from legal perspective and they
2:03:26
will pass that information to product manager and then product manager will uh work with engineering team in order to
2:03:31
make that customization on that product. So anything related to legal thing uh legal team is your stakeholder go work
2:03:38
with them. So this is about um product penetration into new geography wherein
2:03:45
legal team will come into the picture. One use case. Second use case intellectual property. So whenever you
2:03:50
feel that you have developed a novel approach to solve the customer problem, product manager will closely work with
2:03:56
legal team to understand what kind of IP protection needs to be incorporated. Whether we need to we need to file a
2:04:01
patent, whether we need to file a design protection. So there are multiple types of intellectual property. Patent is just
2:04:07
one. I think mostly people knows only about patent. But uh we have white paper, we have
2:04:13
uh patent, we have design what they call it as a okay I forgot the
2:04:20
name there are multiple I think things I I am just forgetting the names. So IP
2:04:25
patent is just one one part of it. So design protection DP so DP is also
2:04:31
there. So which category this IP novelty will fall into and accordingly the documentation related things will legal
2:04:37
team will take care. So product manager will work closely with legal team. So that is use case number two. And the third case is that for example typically
2:04:44
in let's take example you work in a B2B segment. You have decided to work with
2:04:50
the to acquire a new customer. In that case for all the contracts creating the contracts writing those legal things
2:04:57
getting the sign off from different different people you will closely work with legal team in order to create that
2:05:02
legal documentation. So you should know a little bit about legalities. Al also
2:05:09
you should be able to ask right questions to legal team. Number nine, executive and leadership team provide strategic directions and approve the
2:05:16
major product development product decisions. As I told vision, product vision document you will create it but
2:05:22
at the end executive or leadership team is the one who will approve that vision document. So ensure that product aligns
2:05:27
the company's overall vision and business strategy. So this is the responsibility of leadership team. So by
2:05:33
considering this clause they will either approve your vision document or they will ask you to make some modifications
2:05:39
approve product major product investment including budget resources and timelines. So product manager as I told
2:05:45
initially he will consolidate all the budget related things into product vision document but it's the leadership
2:05:50
team who will approve that budget offer feedback and guidelines to product priorities and market positioning. Again
2:05:57
they he will leadership team will assess your plan and accordingly he will provide the guidance to product
2:06:02
managers. Holds PM accountable for product performance and business outcomes. Monthly you will have review
2:06:07
with executive team. If you are working as a product manager, you have to present your product related things,
2:06:14
KPIs related things once in a month to executive team wherein you will be telling showing them different different
2:06:19
KPIs, how your product is performing, what kind of feedback you are getting it from customer side and if things are not
2:06:26
going well as per the KPIs defined in product vision document, you have to give them a solid plan by which this is
2:06:34
the mitigation plan and this is the corrective action. I'm basically proceeding in this particular way
2:06:39
particular way to address the customer issues. So that kind of justification you need to give you but you are answerable to you as a product manager
2:06:45
you are answer able to execute your leadership team. If you look at other stakeholders they
2:06:52
are your customers. So they are you your work is to get the work done from their side but at the end you need to sell
2:07:00
your uh product to executive team. So very very important. Number nine,
2:07:05
finance, legal, executive. Any questions, guys? We have three more.
2:07:11
Okay. Number 10, customers, users. Again, you you will have you as a
2:07:16
product manager, you will have interaction with customers or users either through marketing team or through
2:07:22
sales and accounts management team. Uh sometimes you can directly get involved
2:07:28
into you know customer service. Sometimes you know they will ask you to uh join the customer surveys. Uh but
2:07:36
customer is another important stakeholder for you. Uh most of the cases the interaction with customer
2:07:42
happens by a marketing team or sales team. Role of customers or end users is ensure end users of the product who
2:07:49
needs the feedback shape the product success. So why they are important? Because uh they are end customers they
2:07:56
are going to buy your product. But when it comes to product development, uh you will have a set of u selected customers.
2:08:03
So with which you ask them okay use this prototypes, use this uh a version of a
2:08:09
product and give us the feedback. So that's where you know you have those selected customers and they will be
2:08:14
responsible to provide the feedback through surveys, interviews or direct usage. Share the pain points, desired
2:08:20
features, user experience uh challenges with product management. adopt the adopt
2:08:26
and use product influence the product uh future product iterations based on behavior and the feedback. So customers
2:08:34
I think there are two categories one is actually customers and second one is selected customers. A selected
2:08:40
customer's company uses it for uh deciding the getting the quick feedback
2:08:45
about the prototypes and which design options to take it forward and but the
2:08:50
end customers essentially you'll get u uh feedback from the end customers about
2:08:55
you know you you go to Google reviews and all you'll get good amount of feedback and uh that feedback you will use it to iterate next generation
2:09:02
product. 11th one uh suppliers or partners. Mostly you know when you have hardware product this is one of the
2:09:10
stakeholders majorly you know suppliers or partners basically they provide resources material or external services
2:09:17
required for product development in software also you know you who are all your suppliers when it comes to uh
2:09:24
software product third party licenses you know whatever infrastructural things
2:09:31
what they use in order to do the product development they are your suppliers for example you use uh cloud from somebody
2:09:38
else, you use uh CRM software from sales salesforce. So these are your suppliers.
2:09:45
Uh last one operations team again it very much focused on u hardware you know when you have to manufacturer products.
2:09:52
So you the role is ensure the smooth operation of processes, logistics and product development, delivery and
2:09:58
support. Uh oversee production schedule ensure timely delivery of physical
2:10:03
products. So they are responsible for ensuring that uh so and so production goes on smoothly. You have you are
2:10:09
meeting the production related targets with proper quality manage supply chain logistics inventory quality control
2:10:16
where they will collaborate with product management uh collaborative with product management for forecast demand align with operational capacity. So product
2:10:23
manager so they are kind of dependent upon dependent on product managers in order to get the forecast related
2:10:28
information ensure the scalability and efficiency of a processes for product rollouts. So
2:10:36
product manager should ask operations team right questions about are are our operations expenses are optimized or not
2:10:44
or is there any room for improvement. So improvement implement um continu
2:10:51
continuous improvement strategies to optimize the operations and reduce the cost. So they typically look for CIP
2:10:58
projects in order to reduce the operation cost and the touch point with product management is forecasting and uh
2:11:05
once in a quarter you will have interaction with operations team to check how is your operations are
2:11:13
optimized or not or is there any room for improvement because if you reduce the operation related cost overall cost
2:11:18
for your product is getting reduced and that will give additional revenue for your organization.
2:11:23
Yes. So these are these 12 stakeholders and I think based on my experience
2:11:29
if you go to uh any organization you I think all the
2:11:35
stakeholders are captured over here with which product manager you will work closely with.
2:11:40
Module one is all about understanding the product management roles and responsibilities what he does and what
2:11:49
other guys do. So this this point is about what other guys are doing.
2:11:54
PM engineering, UIUX, marketing, sales, customer support, finance, legal,
2:12:00
leadership, customers, end customers, suppliers, partners, operations.
2:12:05
Yeah. So, I think we we did covered in slide number eight uh associate product
2:12:10
manager. Typically, associate product manager uh he he is kind of uh uh dotted
2:12:17
line reporting to product manager. So product manager will delegate couple of tasks to associate product manager and
2:12:23
he is helping the primary product manager. So that's his role. So uh assisting in gathering and documenting
2:12:28
the product requirement, conducting market research, computer analysis, supporting product manager in road map
2:12:34
development, prioritization, collaborative development team on minor feature enhancement, learning the
2:12:41
fundamentals of product management through mentorship and hands-on experience. So some work of product
2:12:46
manager he will delegate to APM. It might be from marketing side, it might be from engineering side, it might be
2:12:52
from operations side, it might be from sales side. So APM based on that particular assignment he will work
2:12:57
closely with uh one of those 12 stakeholders as we mentioned and then whatever roles I I basically explained
2:13:05
that this task he needs to do it. Yeah. So these are the you know
2:13:10
different different CFTs. So that's where you know I I told you like uh if you let's go back to our core skills
2:13:17
skills for a product manager the the point at which we start you know you have to be very good in stakeholder
2:13:22
management communication since you are working with multiple stakeholders you should be able to talk to their talk in
2:13:28
their language articulate the things talk to them get their buy in because you have to work
2:13:35
with multiple people and that's what it makes product management profile very
2:13:41
attractive Because it's very critical role and if you look at you know the kind of roles and responsibilities
2:13:47
product manager does do you think even artificial intelligence can able to replace product manager very very
2:13:53
difficult things are very complex it is not defined in a straight uh way which
2:14:00
which you can able to code it and replace it so that's what product management profile is very very
2:14:07
unique and important so I would say Okay.
2:14:12
The success of your product, how much your basically what assessment you need to do it with reference to your existing
2:14:17
data of your current geography. How much UIUX will contribute in order to uh
2:14:23
basically for contributing to success of your product in geography one. Is it very important? Is it good to have or is
2:14:30
it okay not not much important? Typically based on my experience, I
2:14:36
would like to share you know my experience also. When we say you know people are pushing they are in hurry but
2:14:42
when actually you go with a proposal that okay I see this risk are you okay could you please give me in writing that
2:14:48
you are okay with this risk and uh you are aligned you are okay to take this risk nobody will give you in writing
2:14:54
that okay they are okay with this risk it just we don't put the things on paper just don't we don't go and
2:15:00
professionally explain the things you know the things which are not going good in the organization that's why things
2:15:06
are happening I would say if you go with proper document doumentation uh you can able to convince people that's what I
2:15:13
learned in my product management career here there will be stakeholders in your organization who can support you with
2:15:19
proper data I think all your questions will be answered by or whatever data is required to put that justification you
2:15:26
can work with marketing team give me the details about what kind of opportunities you see in geography 1 geography 2
2:15:31
geography 3 give me the customer preference in this geography based on that where to launch what to launch You
2:15:38
can able to decide and how to launch um you know you can use your you can ask
2:15:44
them to come up with a proposals and you can use your historical information where and all historically you have
2:15:49
launched the product and was it been considered as a success or failure based on that you can have some some
2:15:55
assumptions on how to launch and think most of the BAS and in most of the I
2:16:00
would say some of the PMs also they don't know the details about these tell stakeholders sometimes problem comes and
2:16:07
they they are just clueless you know they don't know how to solve the problems but if you know the R andor of
2:16:13
each of the stakeholders who are your case to key stakeholders and what is their roles and responsibilities if you
2:16:19
ask right questions they are answerable you know just it's up to us how how
2:16:25
rightly we ask them the question just a quick info guys Intellipath offers product management course

2:17:03
the first step towards career growth in the field of product management. Number 11, best practices in product
2:17:10
management. Okay, so what are the best practices in product management? So the
2:17:15
first one is uh develop a clear product vision and strategy. Why it is important? Ideally see best practices in
2:17:21
product management. Ideally this this portion should have been at the in the final module you know wherein we are
2:17:27
talking about best practices but uh since they are included in the beginning uh we will just have a touch based upon
2:17:34
you know all the best practices. But if you did not understood one particular point uh feel free to raise your hand. I
2:17:39
can further elaborate. Typically you know since I told that product vision is the backbone of the product.
2:17:46
So it and the product manager is kind of um uh owner of product vision document
2:17:51
even though he has to get alignment from different different stakeholders. It is expected that you know product vision
2:17:57
should be very clear and uh uh product strategy also should be very very clear. Why it is important? A well- definfined
2:18:04
product vision acts like a you know a northstar uh guiding all the decisions related to
2:18:10
product development. A clear well- definfined instead of well- definfined wellressearched and well- definfined
2:18:16
product uh vision document will will sort out lot of issues in during the
2:18:22
product development phase. You know if you have very clear product vision document create a clear product vision
2:18:28
that aligns with company company's overall vision and mission strategy. break down vision into short-term and
2:18:33
long-term goals. You know that does mean that okay when we go for vision document you will understand short-term we are
2:18:40
basically expecting that how product is expected to perform in short term and short-term is basically anything in uh
2:18:46
less than 3 years. So you will you are you as a product manager you are supposed to put all those short-term
2:18:52
goals for a product and long-term goals for your product in the product vision document. So that's where you have to do
2:18:58
a detailed research and then you should put a realistic numbers. Uh break down the vision into short-term
2:19:05
and long-term goals that can be easily and realistically achieved. Ensure all stakeholders understand and al align
2:19:11
with the product vision to prevent confusion and conflicting priorities. Uh another point I would like to tell based
2:19:17
on my example most of the conflicts you can able to
2:19:23
resolve. What you just need to do is that you have to just refer the vision document and if there are any conflicts between marketing team, engineering
2:19:29
team, finance team, you just try understand their issues and then go to refer the product vision document what
2:19:36
has been aligned at the beginning of the project and with reference to vision document you can able to resolve maximum
2:19:41
number of conflicts between different different stakeholders. So that's where you know you should have very comprehensive clear and welldefined
2:19:48
wellressearched vision document. So that is one of the primary responsibility of a product manager and it is one of the
2:19:54
best practices is have a very clear vision document. Second point a customercentric approach. Why it is
2:20:01
important? Because uh product success is ultimately determined by uh you know
2:20:06
whether customer likes your product or not. If they like it, they will buy it otherwise they will not buy it. So
2:20:12
always focus on what does customer what customer looks what kind of customer needs you are trying to fulfill with
2:20:18
your product. So always have that customercentric approach when you are defining product vision document when
2:20:24
you are you know doing all the problem solving when you are doing any activity just try to be more empathetic towards u
2:20:32
customer side and based on that you should look at the problem and then you should try to resolve it. Best
2:20:38
practices. How to get that customer centric approach? Conduct thorough user research to understand customer pain
2:20:44
points, preferences and customer behaviors. And uh product managers uses
2:20:50
different types of tools like a customer persona journey maps. You you go to
2:20:55
different different customer interviews to keep the customer at the center of the product strategy. So always strategy
2:21:02
should revolve all around customer and it's not only that uh you you get this
2:21:08
data at the beginning of the product development but also you should have the regular touch point with the end
2:21:14
customer before product at be before starting the product development you
2:21:20
know once you create the prototypes and you would like to know which prototype
2:21:25
is better so that you can decide that product you can finalize that prototype design for further product development
2:21:31
process. Again go for selected customers and ask them to use that um prototype
2:21:37
and accordingly you can finalize. So it is called as AB testing. So always be in
2:21:43
contact with end customer and uh based on actual data all the decisions you
2:21:49
should be able to make it the customercentric approach. Third one is prioritize effectively. uh we also
2:21:57
discussed yesterday and we had a detailed discussion about budgeting related constraints which has uh overall
2:22:03
budget resource related constraints, time related constraints. So here that's what it talks about prioritization why
2:22:08
it is important resources and times are always limited. So prioritize the right features and initiatives initiative is
2:22:16
the key of delivering maximum value. So how product manager does it? So there
2:22:21
are different different frameworks product manager uses. So one of the just to give the methodology or first
2:22:28
framework is rice which talks about reach impact confidence and efforts. So
2:22:35
and then second one is Moscow must have should have could have won't have. So these are the way in which you can able
2:22:41
to put all the features and accordingly you can put some numbers you know out of 10
2:22:48
what is if I implement this feature what kind of um reach I'm going to get if I
2:22:54
implement this feature what kind of impact I'm going to get on the product level is it going to impact you know the
2:23:00
confidence of end customer on my product what kind of efforts are required in order to implement that feature so again
2:23:06
I think in subsequent model we will have detailed hands-on experience on all those frameworks. But essentially
2:23:13
prioritization is one of the key activity by product manager and product manager will use these kind of
2:23:19
frameworks in order to uh datadriven
2:23:24
basically he he will use this frameworks in order to come up with the right priority which is backed by solid data
2:23:30
and rice and Moscow are just couple of frameworks align prioritization with uh business
2:23:37
goals and customer impact rather than building every feature what the customer has requested
2:23:44
uh communicate prioritize clearly with proper justification to stakeholders to manage expectation and basically
2:23:51
maintain the focus. So you might get you know different different customer
2:23:56
requirements but that does not mean that all requirements you should be capturing in your product features. You should
2:24:02
only capture those features which are must have on a top priority. Still if you have
2:24:09
resources then you should go for should have. Still if you have leverage then you should go for could have. So this
2:24:16
frameworks will basically very very useful in order to make those decisions. So prioritization is the key. Number
2:24:23
four focus on CTFs cross functional collaboration. Why it is important? Product management is inherently
2:24:31
crossunctional work you know which involves collaboration with engineering, design, marketing, sales and other
2:24:37
teams. Yesterday what we discussed those 16 uh stakeholders including product
2:24:43
management so 15 basically so it is product management uh responsibility to
2:24:49
lead those CTF meetings so he should focus on how to make those CFT discussions more and more productive so
2:24:56
what does that mean how he's going to what are the best practices in order to um make sure that these things is
2:25:03
captured the first best practice is establish a clear line of communication with all teams. Ensure that everyone
2:25:09
understands their roles and responsibilities. Uh facilitate regular cross functional
2:25:15
meetings like uh sprint boards, sprint planning, um retrospectives and views to foster
2:25:24
alignment uh foster culture of collaboration where all teams feel valued and heard in the decision-m
2:25:30
process. So you should make sure that the environment in the CTF is that
2:25:36
everybody would like to participate and if there are issues everybody should feel free to bring those issues
2:25:43
on the table so that there will be a productive discussion. So that's the one of the best practice what product
2:25:49
manager should follow. CFT leading and safety management adopt agile
2:25:54
methodologies why it is important you know everybody knows agile is far better than waterfall way of product
2:26:01
development. It has its own advantages. So agile product management emphasizes flexibility. It goes flexibility, speed,
2:26:10
iterative development making it ideal for today's fast-paced market.
2:26:16
uh best practices. Agile is all about breaking down the product development into different different sprints and uh
2:26:23
release minimum. Basically for each sprint there each sprint there could there will be a MVP and uh basically it
2:26:30
will be released to uh selected customers and we will ask uh customer feedback to learn quickly.
2:26:38
emphasizes continuous improvement through multiple iterations based on feedback and performance data and uh we
2:26:46
use tools like u Jira scrum kban to track the process uh pro progress and
2:26:52
manage workflows and make adjustment if needed so best practices is go for agile
2:26:59
methodology I think hardly I I don't see anybody I think typically use nowadays
2:27:05
waterfall based methodology I I think everybody has already shifted to agile methodology wherein overall work is
2:27:11
divided into different different sprints and uh product development for each of the sprints. Most of the sprints will
2:27:18
happen parallelly instead of sequentially. So that was about point number five.
2:27:24
Point number six very very important. Yesterday also we discussed leverage data for decision- making. Why it is
2:27:30
important? data provides valuable insights into how products are being used and helps identify areas for
2:27:37
improvement. So set up a KPIs, key performance indicators to measure the success of your product. You know it
2:27:44
could be user engagement, customer retention, revenue growth. We will have detailed module about all those what are
2:27:50
the different KPIs product manager will work with uh use AB testing customer analytics and usage
2:27:59
metrics to make informed decisions and validate hypothesis base feature development and product
2:28:07
iteration on data rather than intuition or assumptions. So always you know whatever decisions you make it should be
2:28:14
based on data. You should not think that uh you should not make a decision on subjective analysis. Always it should be
2:28:21
based on objective assessment. So that's the key and uh as we told one of the
2:28:26
skills for product management is you should be able to good with numbers. When you see the numbers you should
2:28:32
quickly able to compute the KPIs. It could be user engagement related KPIs. It could be revenue growth related KPIs.
2:28:39
It could be financial KPIs, quality related KPIs. So always uh use the data
2:28:45
to make informed decisions because you are answerable to success of your
2:28:50
product. If product is not performing well, you are basically answerable to
2:28:55
why did you made that decision. At that time you should be able to justify what data you have used in order to make that
2:29:02
decision. Number seven, effective road mapping. Why it is important? A product road map
2:29:08
uh gives stakeholder a high level view of the product direction and the key milestone.
2:29:13
Best practices uh build a flexible road map. Uh I would say instead of flexible
2:29:19
you should better word here is adaptable road map that outlines the product goal, features and timeline while leaving the
2:29:27
room for adjustment based on the feedback and market changes. Most of the time it happens that you know you start
2:29:32
product development and things will get changed things will change over a period of time. At that time your road map
2:29:38
should be flexible enough adaptable enough so that you can able to adjust it
2:29:43
with reference to the market changes or basically if customer um expectation got
2:29:49
changed over a period of time you should be able to accommodate those changes. So you should add buffer basically at
2:29:56
for each each step. Buffer should not be so high. Buffer should not be uh too
2:30:01
low. Also clearly differentiate between short-term tactical goals and long-term
2:30:06
strategic objectives and initiatives. Regularly update and communicate road
2:30:12
map to all stakeholders ensuring everyone is aligned. So again alignment
2:30:17
is uh what we discussed previously also stakeholder alignment is important. However, here road mapping put clear up
2:30:26
basically the expectation best practices is best practices document a proper road map which should
2:30:32
be flexible enough adaptable enough in order to capture those changes. Road map
2:30:38
should clearly include what are your short-term goals uh what are your long-term goals and uh you should
2:30:45
regularly visit those road maps and if there are any changes basically adjust the road map accordingly. Number eight,
2:30:52
be a strong communicator. Why it is important? Uh PM needs to ensure that all stakeholders both internal and
2:30:58
external are informed and align with the product goals and decisions.
2:31:03
Um maintain open communication channel with cross functional teams. Ensure that ensure clarity on priorities, goals and
2:31:11
progress. Practice active listening to understand concerns and feedback from
2:31:17
both uh stakeholders and customers. Use tools like uh presentations, reports,
2:31:23
dashboard to keep the leadership team and customer update updated on the
2:31:28
product progress. Very very important dashboard. I you know in last three years I developed almost three to five
2:31:35
dashboards which were not previously present in my organization. So people
2:31:40
like dashboards you know people like uh a single slide which talks about
2:31:46
different different KPIs which will give overview about how exactly product is doing. It could be for one product, it
2:31:52
could be for um a group of product or it could be for overall product line. So
2:31:57
always think in that particular perspective. Um be a good communicator.
2:32:03
Communication is not only about uh verbal ability, how good English you
2:32:09
have, you know, it should be you should be able to convey the message. That's the zist basically. And uh it could be
2:32:16
verbal, it could be a return, it could be visual also. So
2:32:21
try to be very crisp and clear. You should not uh give less information. You
2:32:27
should not give too much information also. So you just have to uh balance what are the things you are going to
2:32:33
communicate. So be a good communicator and these things will come over a practice you know.
2:32:39
Okay. Last two uh manage risk and dependencies. Yeah this is what we discussed I think uh uh what's important
2:32:46
product development involves risk. It could be technical risk. It could be market risk. It could be resource related risk and dependencies that needs
2:32:53
to be managed very proactively. Identify a potential risk early on and create a
2:32:58
contingency plan to mitigate them. Uh track uh external dependencies. It could
2:33:03
be a third party integration, partner collaboration to ensure timelines are not uh
2:33:09
disturbed. Communicate, rescan, mitigation strategies to stakeholders transparently
2:33:16
to maintain uh trust. So have very clear communication, transparent communication. you know if things are
2:33:24
not uh going well highlight those things on your dashboard so that you give that proper visibility that okay this
2:33:30
particular area things are not on track it needs further attention so don't hide
2:33:36
any issues and I think with that able with that kind of clear communication you should be able to manage those risk
2:33:43
and have a clear mitigation plan on all the risk and number 10 is about
2:33:49
continuous learning and adoption uh adaptation basically that's what we discussed uh over a period of time
2:33:54
you'll get a good amount of hands-on experience. So you have to learn continuously you will make mistakes uh
2:34:00
but uh learn from it and try to improvise yourself in next iteration. The product landscape evolves very
2:34:07
quickly and PM needs to be adaptable to remain competitive. So if thing got
2:34:12
changed be adaptive. If you make a mistake, accept it. Move ahead. Keep up
2:34:18
with industry trends, new technologies, and market changes that could impact your product or business. Foster a
2:34:25
culture of continuous learning within the team, encouraging innovation and improvement. Encourage uh uh
2:34:32
retrospective after sprints. Basically, encourage feedback kind of session. You
2:34:37
should not only discuss about things went well, you should also openly discuss about things did not went well.
2:34:43
and um uh discuss about your failures in team meetings and based on that you can
2:34:50
able to improvise yourself in the next iteration. So these are uh best practices I think
Tools for Product Management
2:34:56
if you follow not only about uh specific to product management I think last two
2:35:01
these are in general applicable to I think most of your prof your profiles also. So if you follow I think you'll be
2:35:07
able to deliver better value to your organization. So next topic is what are
2:35:13
the different tools product manager uses in different phases of uh product
2:35:18
development. I think uh we have and then followed by
2:35:23
that we have a demo on Trello. Okay. So tools for product managers
2:35:30
I think we have 11 categories. The first category is what tools product what what
2:35:35
are the tools you know which are kind of famous when for product road mapping applications or planning tools basically
2:35:42
aa product plan road monk uh monday.com
2:35:47
I think these are different different tools but I'll just tell
2:35:53
a is very famous a comprehensive road mapping tool that helps with the strategy release and ideas and um in
2:36:01
fact Jira is also Um, Atlassian and Jira they they also in in Jira also we can
2:36:07
create a very good product road map and we have you know another tool Microsoft
2:36:12
uh project planner there also we can create a proper road map and in Jira we
2:36:17
will create a product road map but you just have to know what are the other tools which are
2:36:23
for product road mapping. Uh second point is project management and task tracking tools. Again it is uh overall
2:36:30
you know it is project management tool is Jira and uh road mapping is one of the feature. So Jira is a popular tool
2:36:36
for managing task overall project management. So here you can assign the task especially in agile teams. You can
2:36:44
create uh sprint planning task assignment issue tracking all those things are you can do it in Jira. Uh
2:36:52
again I think there is one more called as Trello. same from Atlassian a simple visual task management tool with for
2:36:59
which I think we will have a boards list and cards for organizing task so today
2:37:04
we will have a hands-on session on Trello uh but from overall project
2:37:09
management perspective Jira is better uh individual you know task management a small projects you can able to do it in
2:37:15
Trello overall project management tool is Jira uh Trello is considered as you know uh task tracking tool a very very
2:37:22
simple and small projects you can able to manage very well in Trello. collaboration tool uh you know Microsoft
2:37:29
Teams one of the well-known collaboration tool we can use slack we can use confluence we can use myro there
2:37:37
are multiple tools uh mostly most of the industries they go for Microsoft teams
2:37:43
prototyping I think uh in prototyping also you can create u UI prototypes by
2:37:49
using Figma we have collaboration Microsoft teams we are
2:37:55
using project management uh Jira and Trello and road mapping also we are
2:38:00
going to use Jira. Next one is uh customer feedback and user research. So
2:38:05
as you know that product manager you'll closely work with the marketing team in order to develop those surveys things uh
2:38:12
marketing survey customer survey. Yeah. So customer feedback and user
2:38:18
research tools. So survey monkey we have typically we go for Google forms very very easy to use but also survey monkey
2:38:25
is very popular survey tool for gathering the user feedback and insights again there are couple of more platforms
2:38:31
like a type form user testing all tool used for conducting detailed customer uh
2:38:36
research including surveys and customer experience data collection there are some more uh platforms but we we will go
2:38:43
for Google forms or survey monkey analytics and data tracking tools uh as I told uh for uh you know
2:38:53
how well your UIUX is doing from that perspective we will we will use Google
2:38:59
Analytics as a part of this course we will have a hands-on session on Google Analytics however we will have a detailed session on Microsoft Excel how
2:39:06
to do a data analytics uh in Microsoft Excel but we can again there are a
2:39:11
couple of more tools like uh we for data visualization we can go for powerbi also I can show some examples in PowerBI we
2:39:19
have uh one more famous tool is there what is that uh for data visualization
2:39:25
agile development uh I think uh Jira is very very famous widely being used across all the industries so we'll go
2:39:32
for Atlas in Jira and we will have a detailed uh uh hands-on exercise on how
2:39:38
to create a project in Jira how to add the different different team members how to create the project planning how to
2:39:44
assign the task how to comment on a task how to assign the statuses, how to log
2:39:51
the bugs, basically issues, tracking the issues, all those things we'll try to understand when we discuss about agile
2:39:57
development tools. Uh which tool is used in B2B products analytics. Uh for B2B
2:40:05
I think mostly see it is um most of the organizations are moving towards PowerBI. So if it is a global
2:40:13
organization high probability is that it is it will be using PowerBI or Tableau
2:40:20
people use Google Analytics also and if not then I think Microsoft Excel is
2:40:26
widely being used. If it is a SAS products, I think um Google Analytics,
2:40:33
PowerBI, Tableau, these are the widely being used tools irrespective of whether
2:40:39
it is B2B or B2C because it it has a great capability of analyzing the data
2:40:45
whether it is a business to business domain or business to customer doesn't doesn't matter. Yeah. So agile we discussed uh CRM I
2:40:54
think CRM we know Salesforce is kind of uh uh has a dominant market share most
2:40:59
of the people are using Salesforce based tools for customer relationship management but my organization use SAP
2:41:06
based tool for uh CRM again it varies but Salesforce is very famous name uh
2:41:12
feature management and experimentation tool uh these tools allow PM to test the new features run experiments and roll
2:41:19
out the features Gradually uh launch directly optimize a tool for
2:41:25
AB testing and experimentation to improve user experience and optimize the
2:41:31
product performance. Split IO feature management platform that helps with the
2:41:37
control features rollout and AB testing. Again most of the times AB testing uh we
2:41:43
do it you know in Figma or you know working prototype. I I hardly used any
2:41:50
of these tools for feature management. Product feedback, you know, again we get a feedback from Google form, survey
2:41:56
monkey, but again there are couple of product boards, aa ideas, Kenny. These are I think uh products which are
2:42:03
specifically focused on getting the end customer feedback and creating road map
2:42:09
for road map management application. Uh documentation, we use documentation
2:42:14
basically Microsoft based tools. uh some people started using Google Docs, Google
2:42:19
PPTs and all those things because it has its own feature cloud-based application but nowadays Microsoft also has
2:42:25
cloud-based cloud-based products. So we can use any of the tools but this is just overall glimpse what are the
2:42:31
different categories of a tool and then what are the famous tools in that category road mapping product management
2:42:39
collaboration prototyping customer feedback analytics uh agile methodology
2:42:45
customer relationship uh feature management product feedback documentation.
2:42:51
So among this one I think I have told which tools for which we are going to
2:42:57
have hands-on experience. We will have hands-on experience for Jira. We'll have it for Trello. We'll have it for Figma.
2:43:04
We will have it for uh Google Analytics. We will have it for survey monkey,
Tool Demo: Trello
2:43:09
Google forms and um that's it for your final presentation. You can use Google
2:43:17
Docs or you can use Microsoft uh PowerPoint also. It's up to you. Okay. So tools are completed. Now let's go in
2:43:26
detail about Trello. So Trello Trello is highly visual and intuitive product project management tool that helps
2:43:33
individuals and teams to organize task uh track the progress and collaborate
2:43:39
effectively. Basically it is based on cranban methodology where task are uh
2:43:44
moved from one stage to another stage. It could be to-do list.
2:43:50
Then after to-do list it is in progress and after in progress it is done. So this is called as carban methodology
2:43:56
wherein the overall task is divided into multiple categories. So task can be a
2:44:02
todo task once you start working on it falls under in progress task and once you complete it it is basically
2:44:08
completed or done task. This is conver methodology and Trello tool basically follows this convert methodology and it
2:44:16
has a very good visual representation. So and again it is free of cost. So that's why Trello is a very common tool.
2:44:25
Trello is used for everything from person to-do list to
2:44:31
uh list large scale team projects due to it simplicity and flexibility. It's very very simple. I think uh once we go to
2:44:37
actual demo you'll understand very good visual representation very easy to use
2:44:42
it you can able to learn in 15 minutes if you don't have previous exposure what
2:44:47
are the use cases of Trello uh project management you know and track progress assign task ensure deadlines are met you
2:44:55
can able to do this one product development use Trello for agile development sprints managing backlogs
2:45:02
again Trello is from Atlassian Jira is also from Atlasia So you can able to have connection
2:45:09
between Trello and Jira. So that you can if something is Jira wherein you made a overall product plan and if some task is
2:45:16
in Trello you can able to connect those task and bring those two tools in sync
2:45:21
and accordingly you can able to track the overall product development which sprint that task is basically
2:45:28
mentioned and then how is that task what's the deadline who wants that task
2:45:33
how to manage the backlogs that's where we are going we are using this product uh trailer tool event planning you know
2:45:40
uh organized task, vendors, timelines, you can able to easily do it. Personal productivity in fact not related for
2:45:48
overall team development but overall your day-to-day open task also you can able to represent very clearly in
2:45:53
Trello. I use uh Microsoft Excel or you know oneote but it is not automative in
2:46:00
Trello. You can have a lot of uh automation options like you can create uh deadline. You will get alarms. You
2:46:08
can able to sync it with different different other tools. So that's the uh
2:46:14
benefit of Trello for personal productivity also. You should be able to use the Trello content creation. Use
2:46:20
Trello to plan, create and schedule content for marketing teams. So content creation also people use the Trello.
2:46:28
uh let's try to understand the top level features of a Trello before we go for actual hands-on session. So you should
2:46:36
know three terminologies. One is boards, list and cards. So boards, what is
2:46:41
boards? Trello's primary structure is the board. So I would say the homepage of a Trello is called as a board or your
2:46:48
uh each project will have its own board. So which represents the project or workflow. Each board contains uh list
2:46:55
and card that help organize task and stages. So let's take uh this course
2:47:02
advanced product project management. It's if you want to develop a timeline for this course, you will create a uh
2:47:08
one project in Trello and the homepage of that Trello is called as a board. So you have a board for this course. Then
2:47:15
second one is list. List represents the stages of a project or categories of a
2:47:21
task. Common list includes to-do, in progress, done. But the list can be
2:47:26
customized which will be suited for different workflows. It could be a
2:47:31
backlog, it could be review. You can rename based on your use case. So list basically the categories different
2:47:37
different categories within that board. And cards cards basically represent the individual task within that list. A user
2:47:45
can add uh description, due dates, they can label it, they can
2:47:52
add attachment, they can add divide that you know activity into small small steps
2:47:57
and they can use a checklist and uh comments into they can add comments into
2:48:03
the card. So they it it will make it more collaborative making them powerful
2:48:09
powerful way to manage the detailed work. So this is cards, boards, list and
2:48:14
cards. So these are the three terminologies. Checklist I told you basically each card each activity can be
2:48:21
further divided into small small task and then you can use that checklist for to break the break even that big big
2:48:28
activity into small small task. Within cards user can add checklist to break down the task into smaller steps. This
2:48:34
helps to track the progress and more complex task or subtasks. So each task can be divided into multiple subtask and
2:48:40
then you have checklist. So visually you can check how many tasks are completed, how many tasks are pending. Labels uh
2:48:47
labels allow users to categorize task by priority, type or any other criteria. Labels can be colorcoded making it easy
2:48:55
to visually identify a specific type of task. Uh label you know you can see a
2:49:01
red, yellow, uh green, you can put labels and visually you should be able to
2:49:06
represent. So high priority, medium priority, low priority, you can use customize the level based on your
2:49:12
application. Due dates and reminders, you know, for each task, each cards I would say uh you have due dates you can
2:49:20
able to put it on the cards. Notification and reminders can be configured to alert users when deadlines
2:49:26
are approaching. So each card you can put a deadline and then you will get auto reminder. This is what the key
2:49:33
feature. Currently I use earlier I was using a notebook to just list on all my
2:49:38
open task. But why you should go for Trello is you can able to put a deadline and it will give you automated u
2:49:45
reminders. Okay this task is due please complete it. Attachments you can attach the files
2:49:51
directly to the cards from their computer or from integrated device like a Google drive, Dropbox, One Drive. This
2:49:59
is useful for sharing documents design and resource related tasks. So for example, you have given one activity to
2:50:06
your junior to complete it and then you want to share the requirement document
2:50:11
to complete that activity. So what you will do you will share that BRD business requirement document as an attachment to
2:50:18
that card and you will assign that card to your junior and you will ask him that okay please uh complete the task and uh
2:50:26
you will give him a deadline and you can able to uh create a checklist also that big task
2:50:32
you can divide into small small task and you will you ask him to update it and then you can have a visual representation about how many task he
2:50:39
how many subtask he has completed how much percentage of work he's completed shared already or shared the V with him.
2:50:45
So you need not to have a meeting with him. You just have to open the Trello and you can check what is the current status.
2:50:51
Team collaboration. Trello enables team collaboration allowing users to assign task, leave comments and tag team
2:50:58
members in discussion. This facilitates the communication and ensures
2:51:03
accountability. So it's collaboration as I told each card you can able to make comments. So people will contribute for
2:51:10
the task. It will make this tool collaborate basically it will bring the
2:51:16
collaboration perspective for the project management and basically it will be it will ensure the
2:51:23
accountability power-ups. So uh powerups uh are the Trello's way of adding
2:51:29
additional functionality to the board. Basically it is all about integrating Trello with other tools. So integration
2:51:36
with the Slack, Google calendar, Jiraa, GitHub, Dropbox enhance productivity.
2:51:42
Power-ups also include tools like a calendar view, card aging features to customize the workflow. So power-ups is
2:51:49
all about connecting this Trello with other tools like a slack, Google calendar, Jira. So you can able to sync
2:51:56
this particular Trello project with other activity and then you have a
2:52:01
better uh uh synchronization and basically you'll have overall picture. So that's where power-ups come into the
2:52:08
picture. It's all about integration. Next feature is butler you know in easier way it is kind of automation. So
2:52:14
butler allows user to automate respective task in Trello. So every time
2:52:20
you know for example you have three three categories or I would say three
2:52:26
list to-do in progress done. So what you will do after completing the task you
2:52:33
will manually take down that take out that card from to-do list and you will put it in in progress. Once uh you
2:52:40
completed that task you will move that card from in progress to done. So this is a manual activity. So this can be
2:52:45
automated that automation facility is also there. It is called as a butler. So automatically move the cards when due
2:52:52
dates are red uh reached or add checklist when the cards is moved to a specific list. So all checklists are
2:52:57
completed then automatically that card will move from one list to another list. So that's the automation part. Comments
2:53:05
and activity tracking. Each card has a comment section where the user can communicate, provide updates and give
2:53:11
feedback to activity tracking. allows user to see the history of changes on the card. For example, who made the
2:53:18
card, updated a due date, added an attachment.
2:53:23
Calendar view a calendar powerup allows user to see the task which are due date which uh with due dates and on a
2:53:31
calendar view provide overview of upcoming deadlines. So calendar view you can see which task is due on what date.
2:53:37
you'll get overall perspective about uh how many tasks are in pipeline and um
2:53:42
what are their respective deadlines. Another feature is uh Trello has a
2:53:48
mobile app on iOS and Android make it easy to manage the task on go. You can able to access it on mobile as well.
2:53:56
Relo also has uh predefined templates you know offers templates for various types of projects such as marketing
2:54:02
campaigns, event planning, product road map, software development, making it easier to get started. So you just have
2:54:08
to download the template and start working upon it. If you feel that template is not good enough, you can create your own simple template also.
2:54:15
Customizable workflow. User can fully customize their uh workflow because all those things can be renamed by renaming
Group Exercise: Trello
2:54:23
the list and the cards based on project requirements. Trello can be adopted for personal use, agile teams and content
2:54:31
planning and whatn not much more. So these are the top level features of Trello. Fine. So it's a group exercise.
2:54:40
So please uh go to your uh Chrome Microsoft Edge and uh to new window
2:54:48
Trello and uh you'll you'll see the first URL itself Trello get started it's
2:54:54
free Trello is less work more flow click on that link hands-on experience
2:55:00
hands-on exercise basically so please please do it parallelly go to Trello
2:55:06
create a user ID for yourself. You should be able to see similar screen like this. Uh let me know if you could
2:55:14
able to create your login. If you could be able to see this screen, we can go to the next step. You should be able to see
2:55:20
the Trello. And this screen is called as a basically it is for templates. You can
2:55:25
able to see all your boards. I'll just uh
2:55:31
come out of full screen mode. Okay. So yeah
2:55:38
let's here so the exercise is uh we have to create a board with the name of web
2:55:44
development project uh just just uh let's try to understand what's the task
2:55:49
and then we will have uh hands-on so we have to create a board
2:55:56
name with a web development project so scenario here is that there is a web development project web development work
2:56:01
is going on and you are the project manager and you have to create a Trello board for this activity and uh there
2:56:08
will be three three uh there are a lot of things you have to do it in the web development and all those tasks are
2:56:14
categor categorized into um five different list one is backlog which is
2:56:19
yet to be prioritized to do which is uh they are prioritized and uh they are yet
2:56:26
to be started in progress that means they are in progress review that means
2:56:31
development is completed they are under the review and done means uh activities
2:56:36
uh your activities completed, review is done and things are completed. So like
2:56:42
that you have to create uh five list and within that list you you will have
2:56:47
multiple tasks. So in backlog you'll have set up the database write content for
2:56:55
content for about u uh us page content
2:57:01
about uh us page about us page let let's make me a double about us page uh
2:57:08
conduct usability testing prepare final project report so these are the things which are yet to be prioritized to talks
2:57:15
about these are the things which are prioritized but these are not yet started so First activity in to do is
2:57:20
research computer website you have to assign it to uh somebody else you know
2:57:26
there is hypothetical scenario allies and you have to put a deadline that it is deadline today is let's say 13th it
2:57:32
is deadline on 15th of October you have to make a label for this task as a low priority there is a second to do is
2:57:39
design the homepage you have to assign to another user due in 5 days you have
2:57:44
to make a label for this task as a high priority third to do is create uh company logo assign it to third more uh
2:57:51
user in your team new in 4 days label is medium priority. So these are the to-do
2:57:56
list in progress. In progress basically there are there is only one activity which is develop the front end layout
2:58:02
you have to assign it to above due in six days and you have to add the comment that waiting for final design approval.
2:58:10
Uh in review basically in review there are uh two task uh research competitor
2:58:16
website develop the front end layout and the done currently you make it as empty
2:58:22
nothing is in done side uh cards with checklist. So particularly design the homepage if you go to design
2:58:29
the homepage where it is checklist design task design the
2:58:34
homepage. So uh second task under to-do design the homepage. This can be categorized into further small steps. Uh
2:58:42
create a wireframe, get client approval, create a mockups, implement feedback. So
2:58:47
these are small small further this big task is divided into further four subtasks and then you have to basically
2:58:56
uncheck all of them which talks about nothing has been completed. So this activity is 0 percentage completed and
2:59:02
uh attach a file a random file from your PC you can uh attach it which talks
2:59:08
about you know hypothetical case about design brief document it talks about uh the design related details which will be
2:59:15
attached to this particular task. Uh second uh activity in checklist is setup
2:59:21
database. Setup database where it is setup database. Uh so first activity in backlog setup
2:59:27
database. So this also can be further categorized into four steps. Uh choose database type, setup database scheme,
2:59:35
populate scheme, sample data, test connections. So like that you can able to create a subtask and you can check or
2:59:43
uncheck. So this is the task. I think uh you'll get a very good understanding about this activity. So what I will do?
2:59:50
So let's go to our u okay let's create a new board. Go to
2:59:57
create. Then there is some menu called create a board. Click on that board. Background.
3:00:04
You can select uh any of but I think it talks about uh background circuit board
3:00:09
pattern. Select any pattern. I think irrespective of that one. Board title you put it as a
3:00:15
web development project. Visibility private workspace public you put it in a
3:00:22
workspace so that whatever people are there under your team they should be
3:00:27
able to see the progress and hit on create. So
3:00:33
it has created a board with the name of web development project with the background what you have selected
3:00:40
and uh you should be able to see your name on the right side. Let's create a
3:00:47
list now. So how many list we need to create? Uh we need to create backlog,
3:00:52
to-do, in progress, review and done. So here there is you can see on the right
3:00:58
side left side add list. So click there. First is uh
3:01:03
backlog. Click on backlog.
3:01:09
Add list. Then next list is todo
3:01:15
todo add list. Then next one is in progress
3:01:21
add list. Then in review add list and then last is uh done or completed add
3:01:29
list. Okay that's it I think. Next step let's focus on uh backlog. So in backlog
3:01:35
you have to create uh these cards or this top level activity. The first one is the setup database. So you can see
3:01:44
under backlog plus add card. So click there and uh just copy paste
3:01:51
setup database as the first entry. Add card. Next one is write content for
3:01:58
about us page. Next card. Third one is um conduct usability testing. Third one.
3:02:06
Fourth one is prepare final project report. So like that you added four activities. Now let's uh click the first
3:02:14
one setup database. Just click on that card. You will get a new window like
3:02:19
this. You'll get this window. So these are basically the properties what we features of that particular task. Okay.
3:02:27
Everybody can able to see this pop-up window. Let's go over it. So it will have the title here setup database. It
3:02:34
will show in which which list it is. It is in backlog list. Notifications are
3:02:41
uh watch description. You can basically add the description for this task. You can add
3:02:48
something like that. You know, set up the database. You can since you are a
3:02:53
project manager, you can give some more instructions, some more description, talk to person A
3:03:01
for guidance. like that you can add some description
3:03:06
about the task and accordingly you can delegate it to your your basically peer.
3:03:13
Uh next feature what I would like to explain is comments you know. So you have the option on the bottom you can
3:03:20
able to add a comment this basically let's say
3:03:26
since you are going to delegate to person A basically your your mentor your
3:03:32
junior you can say de some comments random comments you can able to
3:03:38
delegate it to John in this case you can add that
3:03:43
comment so that everybody in your team can able to see what has been posted.
3:03:50
Where can I set up the database window? Where can I get the setup database window? Uh yeah. So let me go back in
3:03:59
the backlog. Did you created uh this uh cards setup database as the card?
3:04:07
So watching so there are two things basically you can looks like if you have
3:04:13
created a task and if after a period of time you because of some reason you feel you think that okay this card is no more
3:04:20
valid you want to ignore it you can simply click on uh stop watching the card so it will not be there will not be
3:04:27
active notifications sent so that's the usage of watching and stop watching the
3:04:33
card so click on watch so it is active it's then uh actually being worked in
3:04:39
your project. So delegation option if you click on that join button
3:04:46
I think uh join and okay you can able to so if you
3:04:52
want to delegate this task to your member click on that member and you can add the some member. So here we said
3:04:58
John I think uh you should uh I think uh
3:05:03
we should create a team in the Trello and then you should we can able to use each other's name. I have not explored
3:05:10
that feature but essentially in your actual workplace if you put uh your team member's name you should be able to get
3:05:17
his email id and you should be able to assign this task to that particular person.
3:05:23
Yeah I can able to see. Yeah. Okay fine I I got it.
3:05:31
So that's how I can able to add the label. Just try it out. So members you
3:05:37
if you want to delegate a task to somebody else you can use the member option labels. If you want to label a
3:05:43
particular task with high, more, medium, low or you can use any of the other uh
3:05:48
label and then accordingly you can go to label, you can go to edit accordingly
3:05:54
you can able to put the label title and uh give the label. That's how you can use the label
3:06:03
uh feature. Are you with me? you understood when to use member, how to use label.
3:06:12
Vin not says yes. Now let me uh let's go to checklist. So let's go to our uh uh
3:06:19
exercise. So checklist basically last portion of our checklist talks about uh setup database. We need to create a
3:06:26
checklist of uh four items. So go to checklist
3:06:31
and uh checklist title as database setup checklist. So click on checklist give a
3:06:37
title to title as a database setup steps create add it will create a checklist
3:06:45
and then you have to give those checklist the first sub activity is
3:06:50
choose database type click choose database type click on add it created
3:06:55
here the second one is setup database scheme
3:07:02
go there click there Add. Third one is uh populate sample data.
3:07:09
Copy paste it here. Add. Fourth one is the test connections.
3:07:16
Go there and add. So this activity is further divided into four small
3:07:21
activities. Choose database, setup database, populate sample data, test
3:07:27
connections. So that's how you completed. And currently none of these four are completed. But uh if you click here
3:07:35
it will strike out uh this activity. It shows that this is completed and it will show overall progress as a 20%age
3:07:43
activity is completed. You could able to create a checklist. Just play with the checkbox accordingly.
3:07:50
You know things are uh you can see the completion is getting changed
3:07:58
and it is creating the history also. So sil has done 5 minutes ago. These things
3:08:03
they're capturing what activity everybody is doing. Who who has changed what
3:08:10
couple mark test completion incomplete and all just now all the changes it is tracking.
3:08:16
So so is doing something. Okay I can see. So I can assign anyone
3:08:23
to complete this since you have made the owner as should
3:08:29
be able to edit the checklist currently I think as a member for this task but
3:08:35
the but the bottom line is whoever is owner for this task he can able to edit the checklist
3:08:42
says yes okay good I'll take I'll go ahead attachment you can able to uh
3:08:48
attach a document here You can able to give a URL for from drive. You can able
3:08:53
to uh you can I think directly you can able to click choose a file. You can attach it
3:09:01
or you can uh paste a drive link which will attach that reference uh URL link
3:09:06
so that uh that particular assenee will use that uh data. So in the description you should be able to add all the
3:09:12
details like uh please refer attach a document
3:09:18
for document for detailed
3:09:24
instructions like that you can add a command so that once somebody is using working on that
3:09:30
uh uh task he will go to attachment and he will download it and he will utilize it. So that's the feature attachment.
3:09:40
So what is the use case here? So we are setting up a database. We are adding checklist, right? We have added members
3:09:45
here. Huh. But what is the outcome we wanted from by doing this activity?
3:09:51
Yes. So a big picture why we are doing what we are doing. So uh yeah just open the workspace. Since you are a
3:09:58
project manager, you can able to see how many tasks are in backlog, how many tasks are in to-do, how many
3:10:05
tasks are in progress, who is working on those tasks which are in progress, what
3:10:11
is the level of completion, how many tasks are in review, how many tasks are in completed. And accordingly
3:10:17
this is a project management workspace wherein in a you'll get a snapshot about overall information about your project
3:10:24
where are you and all the information will be shared collaboratively to your members and you need to need not to
3:10:31
share the individual information via teams or individual information via outlooks everything will be part of this
3:10:37
uh this board so that's the main main idea of the trailer I see they are only
3:10:46
added for the backlog card for that particular card it is added. If I open the right content uh you don't see any
3:10:53
member. You can add it. Currently it's empty. You can you can add it
3:10:59
based on your need. You can see the visual representation also who are all contributing for this task. So for setup
3:11:05
database you can see other members are there but for write content you don't see any other members.
3:11:10
What else? So let's go to what we did not explore. Attachment is clear. We can
3:11:16
attach a document cover. So you can have a card level uh
3:11:23
cover you know visual representation. You can change the card level cover and
3:11:28
in fact you can use some emoji. You can use uh the photos which are given in their
3:11:35
repos repository. You can add additional photos from your site also to make it more customizable and more user
3:11:42
friendly. Uh what else?
3:11:50
Then let's go to add power-ups. So add powers power powerups basically that
3:11:55
means uh let let's you can able to
3:12:01
connect this one with other things other other platforms. So
3:12:09
for example you can able to connect it with uh Jira you can able to connect this one with uh
3:12:16
some other platform. So card minor card sync process template for Trello categories analyical
3:12:23
representing yeah developer tools. So these are the different different platforms. So for
3:12:29
example development tools go good mode GitHub scrum agile tools mockup. So
3:12:37
these are additional tools with which you can able to integrate Trello with these tools. So that means if there are
3:12:42
some activities are happening in different tool and this particular task you are uh doing the product management
3:12:49
in Trello, you can also have the sync between this tool and that tool and which are all the other tools with which
3:12:54
you can have the integration. So these are the set of different categories. So you can integrate with the sales tools,
3:13:00
you can integrate with the marketing tool, you can integrate with HR tool and these are the tools. You just have to add that tool and accordingly create
3:13:07
that linkage. The benefit is that everything will be in sync. You will have a clear
3:13:12
visibility about what is happening on that task.
3:13:18
So web development. So power-ups clear you can able to
3:13:25
integrate this particular task this particular card on other tools which are in
3:13:33
different different uh domain uh automation. So uh you can able to
3:13:41
automate some of the task move to so
3:13:48
icon title you can move card to to the top to the bottom of the list
3:13:54
name you can able to move card to to-do list and uh of the team product management
3:14:01
and you can add action basically uh so for example if the all okay if all
3:14:07
The checklist tasks are completed, you can able to move this task from uh
3:14:12
backlog to in progress accordingly. You can create automation and once all the tasks are completed, it will
3:14:18
automatically move. So ideally basic how how you will do it is that you can
3:14:24
manually move from here to here. This is possible. So every time you know this conduct usability let's say in this is
3:14:30
backlog this is not under priority. I want to bring it priority. I move it from backlog to to-do. just go drag and
3:14:36
drop and to do uh basically now I have the bandwidth ala I want to start working upon it I I moved this task from
3:14:42
to-do list to in progress so now it is in progress so it has checklist I
3:14:47
completed all the checklist I think that this activity is completed now I want to move it from in progress to review so
3:14:53
this manual activity can be eliminated by going by by doing the automation and
3:15:00
you can put that uh and accordingly once All the checklists
3:15:05
are completed. It can move to the the specified folder specified list which
3:15:11
you have mentioned previously. So that is the usage of action button
3:15:17
and I think that's it. These are all the options. What else we have not explored?
3:15:23
Description, activity, members, label, checklist, dates, attachment, cover,
3:15:28
custom fields. What is there in the custom fields? uh add drop-down text field dates more
3:15:36
to your cards but there are some additional things but essentially uh if
3:15:41
you are a project manager use this Trello create a list of task you can able to see everything what is happening
3:15:47
and you can able to have better collaboration with your team members so that's the gist
3:15:54
okay that's it guys I think uh I hope you got uh fair understanding about uh
3:16:01

3:16:34
visit the course page link given below in the description and take the first step towards career growth in the field
3:16:39
of product management. Target uh module number eight, a small topic product life cycle management,
3:16:45
product life cycle strategy. So, this we will try to finish it. Plus, we will start uh phase two which is focused on
3:16:51
product strategy and value proposition. Okay. So, some research I think will be definitely helpful for you in order to
3:16:57
define your path, how you would like to transition. Fine, no problem. So let's
3:17:02
start with uh module 8 which was the second part of phase one wherein we are
Product Lifecycle and Strategy
3:17:08
trying to understand the fundamentals of product management. So module 8 the title of the module is product life
3:17:14
cycle and strategy. So let me go back to the course. What are we going to learn? So we are going to learn what is the
3:17:21
meaning of product life cycle and how basically product uh goes through different different life cycle phases.
3:17:27
Point number one again it is uh very uh common topic PLC management. I think many of you might be working in product
3:17:34
life cycle management. The important factor today is basically at the end of the day what you have learned significantly is the strategic decisions
3:17:41
what product manager makes at different life cycle stages. So this is the important thing which uh you you I think
3:17:47
will add lot of value for your understanding about overall product manager's profile. The third point is
3:17:54
product strategy development. I'm not sure why this this product life cycle strategy because we have separate phase
3:18:00
itself product strategy development. So I thought about it and instead of uh
3:18:05
giving some information here I want to skip point number three. Uh we will discuss about it in product strategy
3:18:11
related uh phase which is in next phase. Point number four product portfolio management. So we will understand in
3:18:17
general what is product portfolio? How to manage product portfolio on point number five PLC management tool. So
3:18:24
again I think in last module we had gone through all the tools different types of tools different different tools what
3:18:30
product managers uses not only specific to PLC product life cycle management but in general you know product development
3:18:36
product release overall PLC management product launch so Jira and we already
3:18:44
had a kind of orientation what is these tools uh we had demo session I think uh
3:18:51
hands-on session on Trello last time I will be planning similar hands-on session for Jira but not as a part of
3:18:58
this module but when we go to actual product development module I think which is in next phases wherein actually
3:19:05
product manager will work with engineering team at that time what are those features of Jira which product
3:19:10
manager should know so I'll touch base about uh Jira in detail there but essentially model step number five
3:19:16
introduction to the different tools under PLC management we already covered
3:19:21
uh number six uh we will have very interesting case study uh Netflix how what are the different products they
3:19:28
have launched over a period of time and how basically uh they have managed their
3:19:34
product life cycle very well. So it was one of the success story. So I have created a case study uploaded uh uh
3:19:41
upload it on a Google drive I think share drive uh which I will ask you to go through it and after that we can
3:19:47
discuss and last point is evaluating product performance and matrices. Again
3:19:52
I am not uh sure why this seven and
3:19:58
three is there as a part of this curriculum because again we have separate uh model itself on product
3:20:04
analytics called as product analytics which involves detailed understanding of product performance and different
Understanding Product Lifecycle Stages
3:20:11
matrices. So this point number seven and point number three we will park for next pages. With that said let's uh go to
3:20:19
understanding product life cycle. So what is product life cycle? So
3:20:26
product life cycle management refers to it's a strategic process of managing product's journey from inception or from
3:20:34
concept to its uh decline basically until we retire the product. It involves
3:20:40
overseeing the entire life cycle of a product from early stage of development through market introduction, growth,
3:20:47
maturity and eventually decline. Effective product life cycle management helps companies to maximize product
3:20:52
profitability and make informed decisions at each phase. So this is very very important to know if if you are a
3:20:59
product manager you should be able to tell currently you are in which phase of uh the PLC management and accordingly
3:21:05
product manager will will have different different strategies on those on that product considering what phase it is. So
3:21:13
this is the graph. Okay. So overall this um product life cycle is ordered into
3:21:18
five stages five phases. The first one is development phase you know you can see development phase where in uh mostly
3:21:27
you are working with R&D team and you know incubation is started product development concept feasibility has been
3:21:33
tested but essentially lot of time you are going to work up on product development but you don't have any
3:21:39
revenue you don't see any sales. Uh the next one is introduction phase you know wherein you have just launched the
3:21:45
product uh sales started picking you started generating revenue uh steadily slowly you can see the product revenue
3:21:52
is increasing growing customer base you know you are trying to build the brand
3:21:57
for your product you know you you have done the pricing you have worked on distribution channels so this is the
3:22:03
introduction phase where in uh slowly slowly you are getting revenue then
3:22:08
growth phase actually wherein you Customers have accepted your product. They have
3:22:14
liked your product and it kind of you know the exponential growth phase wherein
3:22:20
you will see a good amount of uh revenue increase wherein you know you're trying to gain the profit. There is a demand
3:22:27
for your product is increasing and uh you start looking for there is a
3:22:32
competition in the market. Some people are started looking at your product. They started you know buying your
3:22:38
product. Some of the players they will do the reverse engineering and they will try to mimic your product. So you might
3:22:44
see some competition. So this is the growth phase wherein you can see you can see the revenue is increasing
3:22:50
exponentially. The number of units sold are increasing exponentially. This will
3:22:56
go uh for a couple of uh months or years depends upon what type of product it is.
3:23:01
But after few after some time you will feel that you know it kind of saturated. Whatever you do, you can add some
3:23:08
features, you can launch new generation of product but looks like uh you are not
3:23:13
able to capture additional market. So it is called as a saturation phase or maturity phase wherein uh sales have
3:23:20
peaked, growth is stabilized, market is saturized saturated
3:23:26
and uh basically this this this current technology is also saturated everybody's using it and meanwhile you can see that
3:23:33
the new technology is emerging and slowly slowly people are moving towards new technology. So you can see slight
3:23:40
decline in the product revenue. It is called as a maturity phase. And the last
3:23:45
phase we're in decline wherein you know the product uh new generation of product is already launch launched and uh we are
3:23:53
no more uh kind of putting additional efforts additional resources on this generation of product and the sales for
3:24:00
this generation product has decre basically they are in decreasing trend. So this is a typical product life cycle
3:24:07
phases and this is typical product life cycle graphical representation. At each stage product manager will make specific
3:24:14
decisions to adapt to market dynamics, customer needs and competitive landscape. So product manager's
3:24:20
responsibility is in each phase how can I effectively make a decisions which can capture maximum revenue for the product
3:24:27
and it can able to generate maximum revenue for the organization. So these are the phases development introduction
3:24:33
growth maturity decline development actual R&D work engineering development introduction you just launched it you
3:24:39
know you have initial set of customers they started utilize using your product some of them have liked it growth market
3:24:46
has accepted your product you can see suddenly jump in the demand high growth maturity you know you can see the demand
3:24:53
is kind of saturated whatever you do you can you are not able to increase the
3:24:58
sales significantly Uh and uh parally you can see you know a
3:25:04
new generation of product people are launching and the decline wherein you know uh your sales has decreased and you
3:25:11
are basically new your customers are moving towards uh new generation product from your organization or they are
3:25:17
moving new generation product from your competitor. Example product name. Yeah, I think uh we can take example of your
3:25:25
uh mobile handset you know in fact uh 4G based mobiles you can take when 4G was
3:25:31
uh launched it was under development phase and uh Joe was the first one I
3:25:37
think who have came up with a proper well working smartphone during
3:25:42
development phase then initially they gave kind of uh they came up with a marketing strategy wherein they gave
3:25:48
data free for a couple of months wherein you know people have bought their seam.
3:25:53
They started utilizing the data since it was free of cost. They could able to capture the initial customer. The
3:25:59
intention from Jio was to check the compatibility of their system to check
3:26:04
if can if it can able to handle so many customers at a time or not. So
3:26:10
accordingly you know they have introduced the product and you know in growth phase they can they have seen the
3:26:15
rapid increase in the market. Parallelly I think uh Aerale BSNL other guys also
3:26:21
started uh coming up in 4G segment they have started giving the competition now
3:26:26
it is kind of 4G market is uh I I'm telling currently it is in decline phase but couple of years back it was in
3:26:33
maturity phase so whatever new plans Jio used to come up uh they could not able
3:26:39
to capture additional market share there was a competition they used to pull each other's customers Jio versusail but
3:26:45
however you know the kind of 4G market was saturated. Parallelly you know uh 5G was successful and Jio started moving
3:26:54
from 4G to 5G. Currently if you see uh Jio smartphones which are on 4G based 4G
3:27:00
based technologies I think uh they are not doing additional investment on those smartphones uh since the new technology
3:27:06
is already available. So those smartphones are kind of in declining phase and now everybody has moved to the
3:27:12
5G technology. Yeah. So if this uh PLC phases are clear then let's try to
Strategic Decisions at Different Lifecycle Stages
3:27:18
understand what it is uh what it what it is mean for product manager. So let's
3:27:25
see the strategic decisions at different life cycle what uh product manager
3:27:30
makes. The first one uh development stage. So description as we discussed uh this is a pre-launch phase wherein
3:27:37
product is in development. It involves uh ideation lot of research you know
3:27:42
prototypes MVP there are no revenue at this point and costs are very high you
3:27:49
have invested heavily for R&D related expenses but you have not made a single rupee from your product so this is
3:27:55
called the development phase what are those key decisions for a product manager so wherein you know product
3:28:01
manager will closely work with the marketing team they will ask to conduct in-depth market research to understand
3:28:07
uh understand customer painoint areas, what are the additional features uh they need to include, what are the features
3:28:13
they need to include in their product and accordingly the prototypes are developed. Uh product manager will
3:28:19
closely work with marketing team to understand what is our target audience, market segmentation to be precise, what
3:28:26
are the competitive landscape, who are all our core competitors, what kind of products they are having in
3:28:32
the market. So all those detailed research product manager will do along with the marketing team. Parally product
3:28:39
manager will work with the engineering and development team to check the physibility and concept testing. So
3:28:44
validate the product idea with the prototypes, surveys, focus group to access the technical feibility
3:28:51
and market viability. So here focus group means basically a selected set of customers. it is for MVP kind of uh
3:28:59
application wherein uh you have prototype you have kind of two concepts
3:29:04
uh ready you don't know which one to be finalized so what you are what you have decided you asked engineering to come up
3:29:10
with the MVP and then you are kind of uh giving this MVP to certain customers and
3:29:17
ask them okay please use it and let me know which one is uh better considering
3:29:23
market viability. So accordingly he will work with the engineering and uh you know kind of a selected set of customers
3:29:30
to validate feasibility and concept testing. He'll work with engineering to finalize
3:29:36
the development plan collaborate with R&D team engineers and designers to finalize the product design and set
3:29:42
milestones. So you can have he will have kind of a few bi-weekly or monthly
3:29:47
review with the engineering team. He will check whether uh all things are on track or not and uh he will have you
3:29:55
know all those questions ready all the gate basically product will go from alpha beta and all those matured phases.
3:30:02
So all those get reviews he will be involved and product manager is the one who will give approval for those get
3:30:08
reviews by looking at uh product development plan by looking at um test
3:30:15
results alpha test results beta test results. Go to market strategy product manager again will work with the
3:30:20
marketing team in order to finalize okay what should be the pricing for our product what kind of distribution channels we should use it for launching
3:30:27
the product what kind of marketing strategy is the way in which I think um subill submill mentioned about Jio
3:30:34
similarly I think what kind of marketing strategies we should use it for our product accordingly product manager will work closely with marketing team to
3:30:40
define those marketing strategies and they will have kind of a rough timeline about uh launch when to launch the
3:30:47
product overall go to market plan will be finalized during development phase.
3:30:53
Uh budget allocation again it happens uh way at the start of development phase
3:30:58
itself wherein uh budget and all everything will be written in the vision document and accordingly budget resources are allocated to different
3:31:06
different uh stakeholders allocate resources efficiently between development testing pre-launch marketing
3:31:11
efforts. So all those things uh product manager will be have a rough estimation about what kind of resources are
3:31:17
required and accordingly budget allocation and budget release will happen in this phase. So these are the
3:31:23
key things what product manager will do. Market research visibility concept development planning
3:31:29
defining go to market strategy budget related things. This is what development phase means for
3:31:36
product manager. very very crucial because uh this will
3:31:42
pave the foundation for overall product success. This is about development phase and now let's focus on introduction
3:31:48
phase. So introduction phase basically the product is introduced to the market. So you have done the launching sales are
3:31:55
initially slow as as and basically slowly slowly awareness is getting built
3:32:00
up in the market and companies uh like a report future of enter. Okay, I think
3:32:07
that was for this one. Okay, fine. Sorry. Yeah, awareness is getting built up and the company is focused on the
3:32:12
market penetration. Cost remains high, profits may be low or negative. Yeah. So
3:32:19
this is the phase as we discussed you know you just launched the product slowly slowly awareness is getting built up you are but basically here you
3:32:26
started making money. So profits are negative low definitely they will be
3:32:31
negative because see you have spent so much amount of money during development phase and it might not happen you know
3:32:38
during introduction phase itself you will recover all those money. So from return on investment perspective you will see the return is negative during
3:32:44
introduction phase. That's how it is for all the you know products during introduction phase. Uh costs are high
3:32:52
but at least you started looking for um you started realizing revenue and uh you
3:32:58
are looking for uh basically opportunities to penetrate your product.
3:33:03
So accordingly basically you launched one product you in one particular geography and uh sales are picking up
3:33:11
and now you are looking for okay what else where else I can launch this product so that I can able to increase
3:33:17
my return on investment. So what are the key decisions for a product manager in introduction phase pricing strategy you
3:33:23
know as we discussed in go to market strategy itself basically we started working with marketing team in order to
3:33:29
finalize pricing distribution. So in pricing decide decide between uh
3:33:34
penetrating penetration pricing low price to attract early adopters or
3:33:39
scheming pricing high price to recoup development cost. So there are different different pricing strategy product
3:33:45
manager and marketing team will decide. Again we will have in detail module
3:33:50
about how to set up the pricing. But uh for this concept per se uh there are two kind of concept penetrating pricing
3:33:58
wherein you know we will have a low pricing initially kind of um launch offers pre-launch offers launch offers
3:34:04
wherein we are asking customers to okay please use our product. we are ready to give 40%age discount 50 percentage of
3:34:10
discount since you are our first customer or skimming pricing wherein um
3:34:15
uh you you feel that you are uh you have good amount of demand forecasted demand so you are telling that okay I would
3:34:22
like to put it as a premium pricing because my intention is not to increase
3:34:27
the customer base but my intention is I would like to recover my development phase because that's how my financial
3:34:33
targets are because I need to pay back money to my investors it could be any decisions. So basically in introduction
3:34:40
phase you will look at look at the product from how much revenue it has made and basically you will decide the
3:34:46
different different pricing strategies for penetration purpose. Again you will
3:34:51
work with marketing team for uh invest marketing campaigns to create awareness and educate customers. This can include
3:34:59
digital marketing partnership or influencers collaboration. So since
3:35:04
product is launched you will look for okay another revenues another avenues basically to increase the revenue uh
3:35:10
potential. So can we go for digital marketing? Can I partner with somebody else? Can I you know advertise it on
3:35:17
YouTube influencers? So what is the right way wherein I can make my
3:35:22
promotional activities so that I can able to create maximum impact to the market uh distribution channel. So even
3:35:30
though you started working with marketing team on deciding the distribution channels however you know the optimization related work so you
3:35:36
would have decided okay I'll be using some distribution channels but uh you by
3:35:41
looking at the revenue you can able to check you are you are basically getting the actual feedback okay then you can able to decide whether you made a
3:35:48
whatever decision you made during development phase about a particular distribution channel is right or not so
3:35:53
accordingly you can optimize uh distribution channels choose the right channels to distribute the product
3:35:59
Whether online or whether to retail or whether to make a partner or via direct
3:36:04
sales accordingly. You can optimize the distribution channels feedback mechanisms. You will closely work with
3:36:12
the you know sales team to get the feedback from end customers. Establish system to gather early customer
3:36:18
feedback. Refine the products on this input. So you will closely monitor okay what kind of feedback you are getting
3:36:24
from the end customers and uh if there are lot of negative feedbacks you know you have to quickly act upon it and
3:36:31
accordingly you have to adjust the product feature. This is very very crucial time because uh you know a
3:36:38
positive reviews and negative reviews very uh spread very fastly. So you have to ensure that uh if there are negative
3:36:45
reviews you have to ensure that you are quickly acting upon acted upon it and whatever modifications required on the
3:36:51
product you are you need to closely work with engineering team in order to make those modifications.
3:36:56
Sales strategy align sales align with sales team with marketing efforts and provide tools for customer education and
3:37:02
onboarding accordingly. Basically you will create a manuals, you will create a demos. You might in B2B segments
3:37:10
particularly you will you will visit multiple customers you will show them the demos you will release the marketing
3:37:16
collaterals and all those things you will do it in order to capture more and more
3:37:21
customers. So that's what you do it in introduction phase pricing marketing promotion distribution channel
3:37:28
optimization uh sales different creating a different different sales strategies and uh
3:37:35
closely looking at customer feedback and if there are issues you will closely work with engineering team in order to
3:37:41
close those gaps. So this is the introduction phase but uh essentially did you guys clear
3:37:48
what are the things product manager will do. Don't worry about the details uh since we have separate separate modules
3:37:53
I don't want to go in detail otherwise we will be derailing the PLC related discussion uh but just try to understand
3:38:00
uh the overview about what activities product manager will do okay fine let's move to growth phase growth phase uh
3:38:07
description uh basically the product starts getting acceptance people have liked your product and you are spending
3:38:14
good amount of you know uh money on promos marketing activities so because
3:38:19
of that uh sales are increasing rapidly. This is the most profitable phase as
3:38:26
both revenue and market share goes up while uh competition also intensifies.
3:38:33
Uh so as we discussed basically this is the phase wherein you can see the
3:38:38
exponential growth for your revenue for your uh number of units been sold and uh
3:38:44
this is the phase in which you will capture maximum revenue from the market. So this phase is focused on uh what are
3:38:52
the product manager roles and responsibilities. So your key stakeholders for this one is your operations team. So you have to expand
3:38:59
production logistics customer support to meet the increasing demand. So I think
3:39:05
we had one uh somebody shared uh I think Vod was Vinod who shared that um Ashirat
3:39:13
case is from ITC. So I think uh if they know that they are actually in growth
3:39:19
phase they would have focused more on backend operations. So accordingly you know scaling up operations uh is very
3:39:26
very important. You have to ensure make sure that you know you have sufficient foundational infrastructural facilities
3:39:32
available in order to capture the increased demand market expansion. So
3:39:37
okay you have you have good foundation you have good uh framework available but again in growth phase you will like you
3:39:44
would like to expand the market further. So you'll look for identify new customer segments you will look for identifying
3:39:51
launching the product in new geographical segments or use uh usage uh
3:39:57
occasions to grow market share. So you know promotional activities Diwali
3:40:02
festival. So you will you'll you'll put more efforts on increasing your market
3:40:07
share increasing basically on market expansion but in growth phase you know you again as I told you know we will
3:40:14
keep on looking for the customer feedback. So you might find there are couple of uh product related
3:40:20
improvements are also possible because you have been getting the feedback from end customer. So in this phase you can
3:40:26
think of uh rolling out the enhancements new features or bug fixes uh
3:40:32
complimentary products to say to stay compliment the market. So you can think
3:40:37
of creating additional features you can think of working on the bug fixes a faceelift. So you can you are basically
3:40:45
essentially you are improving your uh product value proposition. Brand building, you know, you'll invest
3:40:51
heavily in branding and marketing to build the customer loyalty and differentiate from competitors. Pricing
3:40:57
adjustment depending upon uh demand and competition either maintain initial
3:41:02
pricing or consider reducing the pricing to attract more customer. Pricing related thing basically you again you
3:41:08
can think of you know since you are looking for a new geography you might want to go for promotional activities.
3:41:14
So accordingly you can have pricing related adjustment. Again you can have pricing related adjustment based on
3:41:19
different different geography. So in one geography wherein product is actually in uh uh already launched it is picking up
3:41:27
the phase. You will keep the pricing as it is or you can think of increasing the pricing so that you will capture maximum
3:41:33
revenue and uh since you are looking for add new geography there you can think of going for discounted pricing to capture
3:41:40
initial customers. partnership established partnership or collaboration with to boost the to boost reach such as
3:41:48
uh retailers, distributor, strategic alliance. So this is the phase wherein you will work with sales team and you
3:41:54
will check okay what is do we have sufficient resources available for making the direct sales. If you don't
3:42:00
have sufficient resources available, you will look for partnership opportunities. So accordingly we'll collaborate with
3:42:06
those people in order retailers, distributors in order to have partnership and you are basically
3:42:11
increasing your product reach so that it should be product should be easily available uh across multiple customers.
3:42:20
So that's how these are the things you would do it in growth phase majorly focused on scaling up the operations
3:42:27
looking for additional opportunities for increasing the market expansion and you
3:42:32
can think of making your product even more attractive by adding some more uh
3:42:37
features or you know you can have if there are bug fixes you'll go for bug
3:42:42
fix bug fixes and you will basically revi revive your product in this phase
3:42:48
to remain competitive. This is growth phase for product manager. Maturity phase uh sales growth uh slows down as
3:42:55
market becomes saturated. The product has achieved its peak potential. Uh
3:43:02
profits are stable but uh growth prospects may be limited. So that's what I was telling even though you spend good
3:43:08
amount of um resources on promotional activities, marketing activities, hardly
3:43:14
you see u any improvement in the revenue. So that shows that uh this
3:43:20
technology this product is matured perhaps you need to look go for new generation technology or new new new
3:43:26
product. So what you will do okay since you know that product is matured but you
3:43:31
will not ignore the product as a product manager what you will do product differentiation focus on product
3:43:36
variations. So you can think of launching new models. You can think of launching new versions. You can think of
3:43:43
uh giving a more updates for your product to keep the product fresh and to
3:43:48
attract different customer segments. So here your major aim is to defend your
3:43:53
current market share because sales are going down and you your sales are basically not increases and then you
3:44:00
would like to defend your product. It might happen that you know whatever your customers are there they might go to
3:44:06
your competitor's product. So in order to retain them you are continuously looking for more product differentiation
3:44:11
opportunities. So what are those product differentiation opportunities? You would like to launch a new variant. You would
3:44:18
like to launch a new version or you would like to launch updates. So if you look at you know uh Redmi you know what
3:44:26
they do. So once they have Redmi 13, Redmi 13 Pro, Redmi 13 Pro Max, these
3:44:33
are like a new new variants which they launch. So initially when they launch a product, it is only Redmi 13. But after
3:44:40
some period of time when they feel that 13 market, you know, market is saturated, people don't want to buy
3:44:45
anymore Redmi 13. What they will do? They will go for Redmi 13 Pro. So they will say okay camera is advanced battery
3:44:52
capacity is advanced there were issues what we were seeing in uh original market or first first u product we have
3:45:00
uh kind of came up with a bug fix solution for those issues and now it has improved the performance. So like that
3:45:06
you are trying to differentiate your product and you would like to defend your market share. So that's the first
3:45:14
activity what you as a product manager will do it. Second activity very very important cost optimization. So you see
3:45:21
you know most of the cost reduction things cost reduction projects will come into the picture wherein you are looking
3:45:26
for opportunities to reduce the production and operation cost to maintain the profitability because you
3:45:32
understood that whatever you do revenue is not going to increase but your aim is to increase the profitability.
3:45:38
Profitability increase by either you increase revenue or you reduce the cost. So since it is in maturity phase, you
3:45:45
don't have any opportunities to increase the revenue. So additional thing is reduce the cost. So how will you do the
3:45:51
cost cutting? You will think okay what are those operational things where it can be optimized to reduce the cost. Uh
3:45:59
you can think of you know um reducing those resources also. So earlier you decided that for product support I need
3:46:05
five resources. But in order to make your product um more attractive you will
3:46:10
think okay I don't need five resources. it is matured now people have learned how to deal with the issues I don't want
3:46:16
five I'll just go for three so those two resources you have reduced it so because of which your operational cost has been
3:46:22
came down so this is the phase wherein uh this is the activity wherein you can think you can say that there are lot of
3:46:28
layoffs are happening typically when companies don't achieve their financial
3:46:33
targets they do the layoff and why they do the layoff because of cost optimization I think uh if you look at
3:46:41
uh not very far away. Uh but uh one year back only there was a mass layoff from
3:46:47
Google, mass layoff from Microsoft, mass layoff from Meta. My organization also did lot of layoff. So what why they do
3:46:54
all those things? Because of they would like to reduce the cost. One of the way to reduce the cost is uh reduce the
3:47:00
resources. So this is the cost optimization. But uh you as a product manager will not do you know um human
3:47:06
resources related to cost optimization but you will look at the opportunities for product level cost optimization. You
3:47:12
will look at your operational cost. You will look at your resource related cost and accordingly you will say I don't need five resources. I need only three
3:47:18
resources. So those two resources will be allocated to some other product not for your product. But cost optimization
3:47:24
is the key activity. You will do it during the maturity phase. Customer retention, implement loyalty programs,
3:47:30
customer engagement strategies, improved after sales services to retain existing customers. So these are the as we
3:47:38
discussed you know product differentiation. It could be launching the new product or it could be you know retaining the customers by using some
3:47:44
loyalty programs. Promotion tweaks uh shift marketing focus from customer acquisition to retention upscaling
3:47:51
cross-selling on other products in portfolio. So if you get this product you will get some discount on this
3:47:58
product like that you know you'll have some marketing related strategies in order to retain the current market share
3:48:04
pricing strategy. So you can think of reducing the pricing also in order to retain the customer customer segments.
3:48:11
Typically you'll you'll look for those big billion sales, Diwali offers, flipkart related you know again big
3:48:18
billion days and all those kind of uh um opportunities in order to attract more
3:48:24
and more customers you would like to or you can say a winter sale. You would
3:48:29
have heard about winter sale typically it is very famous during in apparel industry. So wherein they will reduce
3:48:36
the cost and they will they would like to clear the existing inventory. Existing inventory means they would like to clear the existing inventory for old
3:48:44
generation product. So consider price reduction building the products to sustain demand compete against newer
3:48:51
entrance into the market. Channel optimization explore new or more efficient distribution channels such as
3:48:56
e-commerce direct to consumer models. So you can think of uh in earlier you might
3:49:01
have used direct sales but in order to reduce that um sales resources you will
3:49:07
think that okay I don't want to do selling for this product I will directly push my product through e-commerce and I
3:49:13
can able to reduce those resources accordingly I can able to reduce the cost which I am encountering because of
3:49:20
uh having the direct sales. So those things also you will do it during maturity phase. Your idea is increase
3:49:27
the profitability. If not from revenue side then reduce the cost and accordingly ensure that you are getting
3:49:34
optimal uh profits from the product. This is the maturity phase for the product managers.
3:49:40
Let's go to last last phase which is declining phase. Decline phase. Uh sales
3:49:46
begin to decline as the product becomes outdated, obsolete. customer uh they
3:49:52
would like to move to the new product. Competition might have introduced better alternatives. Maintaining profitability
3:49:58
becomes very very difficult. So key decisions for a product manager product revitalization. Decide whether to invest
3:50:06
in product refresh upgrade responding to extend its life or whether to retire the
3:50:13
product. plan to smooth or basically retirement basically smoothly phase out the product and discontinue the product
3:50:19
while maintaining the customer satisfaction. So it's a very very important you know in declining phase uh
3:50:25
it is very key decision to understand whether you are in maturity phase or whether you are in declining phase
3:50:32
because if you feel you are in maturity phase what you will do you will spend some more resources in order to revitalize revitalize the product or
3:50:39
increase you know making the product refresh upgrades but if you feel that okay you are in
3:50:45
declining phase you will have a strategy to retire the product. So it is very very important for a product manager to
3:50:51
understand have a clear bifurcation about maturity versus decline. Harvey
3:50:56
strategy focus on maximizing the profitability by reducing the cost maximizing marketing and extending the
3:51:03
product life cycle life in a niche market. So in declining phase also product manager can think okay uh there
3:51:10
is a particular niche market this is a particular geography wherein I don't see the competition for uh new generation
3:51:17
product. So I can still sell my old generation products in this particular
3:51:22
geography and accordingly they can have harvesting strategy. So maximize exploiting one particular geography to
3:51:30
uh capture more and more revenue. That's what the harvesting strategy means. Inventory management monitor inventory
3:51:36
closely to avoid over production and manage stocks effectively to reduce the excess. Again you will have a closely
3:51:42
close close look at operations related things. So you don't want to capture more and more inventory. You would like
3:51:48
to reduce the inventory handling related expenses. End of life support. Establish customer communication plan and services
3:51:54
support offering existing users as the product winds down. So end of life support, customer notification, inform
3:52:02
them that okay this c this particular product will be phased out and in place of this product you can think of having
3:52:07
new generation product. Typically it happens for B2B segments. But the key thing for a product manager
3:52:14
is to understand whether you are in maturity or whether you are in declining phase and accordingly you will either
3:52:20
keep on pumping the money to refresh your products or you will come up with a
3:52:25
strategy to phase out your product and harvesting strategy is very very important. So you will look at you know
3:52:33
kind of a new existing geography wherein you will you feel that uh there is a
3:52:38
less competition and there is a less probability that competitor will launch
3:52:43
a new generation product in coming future. So you will still keep your product alive for that particular
3:52:49
geography so that you can able to uh take out some more revenue from your
3:52:55
product. So these are the these are kind of a key decisions product manager will do it in declining phase
3:53:03
is it clear declining phase declining state a smartphone example so I think we
3:53:10
had a lot of discussion but still let's understand you know this PLC life cycle from s smartphone perspective
3:53:16
development research into new new features like uh uh foldable screen okay introduction first generation foldable
3:53:23
smartphone in is introduced uh with the high price and intense marketing. A
3:53:29
growth phase, you know, sales increases increased as more customers are adopting
3:53:35
this foldable screen kind of uh feature based products and uh you are the first
3:53:42
one into the market. Uh competitor has seen your product, they see the potential, they started doing the
3:53:49
reverse engineering and they also they are also coming up with their own product which has this foldable screen feature. So computers are also entering
3:53:56
into the market. Maturity phase wherein smartphones are widely adopted. Uh the companies focus on minor innovations
3:54:04
targeted features like a better cameras and all but specifically foldable screen. This kind of feature is matured.
3:54:12
Uh you don't see any more revenue increased because of this feature. This is a maturity phase and declining phase.
3:54:19
Basically sales drop drops as new technology emerges. It is could be
3:54:24
augmented reality glasses or leading to a potential
3:54:29
product phase out. So you have new generation technology ARVR kind of feature wherein uh this foldable feature
3:54:36
might not be applicable in that case you the customers are moving towards new
3:54:42
generation products which has foldable plus ARVR kind of features and
3:54:48
accordingly you decided that okay let's go for new generation technology and let's phase out this product it is
3:54:54
declining just just a case of smartphone for smartphone as an example with a foldable screen as Feature
3:55:01
development, interaction, growth, maturity and decline. Importance of a PLM for product managers. Product life
3:55:07
cycle management enables product managers to proactively manage the life cycle by making datadriven decisions.
3:55:13
Maximize the profitability, prolong product relevance and optimize resource available at each stage. So as
3:55:20
I told whatever decisions you are going to make as a product manager, this should be based on datadriven. If you
3:55:26
say that you are in maturity phase, it should be based on datadriven. If you are going to product line head and you
3:55:32
you are telling that okay I think that our product is in declining phase you should have a proper data to show that
3:55:38
you are in declining phase. You can go for last quarterly sales data. You can go for what competitors are doing. You
3:55:46
can go for marketing reports like a new generation technology. And with all these justification you should be able
3:55:52
to convince him that okay let's plan for phasing out of phasing out this product
3:55:58
since uh marketing is moving towards new technology. So you should go with the proper data to make your point uh clear
3:56:07
and basically product manager's primary aim is to maximum profitability from this product for your organization and
3:56:14
you have to prolong the product relevance. you have to be relevant into the market to and uh optimize the
3:56:22
resources in order to capture higher profit margins for the organization.
3:56:29
So this is all about uh product life cycle and what are the strategic decisions product managers will make in
3:56:35
order to manage the PLM. You need not to wait for revenue stagnated or revenue
3:56:40
decline because potentially by waiting you are uh losing out the growth related opportunities. If you feel that
Product Portfolio Management
3:56:47
additional adding the additional features it will add lot of value to the end customer why not go for it. It is it
3:56:53
will add profitability for your product. Next one is uh product portfolio
3:56:59
management. Again small topic product portfolio management. So what is product portfolio management? PPM. So the PPM is
3:57:07
a process of managing entire portfolio of a products offered by a organization
3:57:12
or a company. It involves making strategic decisions about which products to develop, invest, maintain,
3:57:20
discontinue based on market performance, customer needs and company objectives.
3:57:25
The goal of PPM is to optimize the product mix to achieve the company's financial and strategic goals. So here
3:57:33
uh you know you consider yourself to be a group product manager wherein you are handling a portfolio of a product.
3:57:40
Portfolio means you have uh multiple products under under your purview and
3:57:46
that is called as a product portfolio and um what you supposed to do is that
3:57:52
you will make a decisions on that product portfolio about uh which products you would like to invest which
3:57:58
products which products you would like to develop which products you would like to keep on investing which products you
3:58:03
would like to maintain it which products you would like to discontinue based on again as we discussed you know market
3:58:09
performance How much revenue we are getting, what kind of customer needs we are fulfilling, what are our company
3:58:15
objectives and couple of more variables like a market trend, competitive analysis and accordingly when you make a
3:58:22
decisions on a group of product it is product portfolio and it is product portfolio management in layman's
3:58:28
language. Key aspects of a product portfolio management is strategic alignment. Ensure that all products in
3:58:35
the portfolio align with company's overall mission, vision and goals. So always you will refer what does
3:58:42
organization would like to do and accordingly you will make a decision on your product portfolio.
3:58:49
Prioritization helps prioritize which products to focus based on potential return, market demand and resource
3:58:55
allocation. So for example, you have five products under your purview and uh but all product all five are having
3:59:02
different different features. They serve different different customer demands and they have their own performance. So
3:59:08
based on that you know you can able to prioritize which one of those five are kind of a key products for you and
3:59:14
accordingly you can make investment decisions. So prioritization is an important aspect for product portfolio
3:59:20
management. Again resource allocation manage the resources uh manage the distribution of
3:59:27
uh financial human and operational resources capital you know across the
3:59:33
different products to maximize the profitability and efficiency. Again uh
3:59:38
you it is a hypothetical case that you have infinite number of resources but in practicality you have limited financial
3:59:46
resources human resources limited operational resources you have to
3:59:51
prioritize which products you would like to focus more on. So accordingly once you have to if you have to manage
3:59:58
product portfolio this resource allocation is an key aspect. So that's where product portfolio management will
4:00:03
give a important role role. Product life cycle management you know uh monitors
4:00:09
the stages of each product within your portfolio from life cycle perspective
4:00:14
introduction growth maturity decline just for some time we discussed and adjust the strategies accordingly such
4:00:20
as investing in growth product or phasing out of the declining ones. So
4:00:26
once you are a portfolio manager you will have a overall understanding about okay I have five products each of these
4:00:33
products falls under each product life cycle and accordingly we will make those decisions what we discussed in previous
4:00:39
section session risk management identifies uh risk across the portfolio
4:00:45
such as market shifts technological changes balances investment across high risk high reward
4:00:53
products and stable performance So risk mitigation I think that's what we were
4:00:58
uh discussed on one question was there I think it was from uh Ankita I guess uh
4:01:04
so risk management is an key roles and responsibility for a portfolio product manager wherein he will look at uh the
4:01:12
technological risk market related risk and accordingly he will focus on higher risk uh high reward products and those
4:01:19
who are stable performance. So risk management is important aspect. Any questions? What is product portfolio
4:01:25
management and why do we need uh what are the key aspects of product portfolio management? Strategic alignment,
4:01:31
prioritization, resource allocation, PLC management, risk management. So this this is all on a portfolio. Essentially
4:01:38
portfolio means a group of products and and for each product there will be a product manager but over and above
4:01:45
product manager will report to a group product manager. A group product manager is kind of a portfolio manager. He has
4:01:51
multiple products to take care of. It is basically a portfolio for um services.
4:01:57
So you can have one service transportation service, another services, local hotel booking, third one could be it turnary, fourth one could be
4:02:05
something else and accordingly you'll have portfolio managers. Yeah. So helps to prioritize which products to focus based on potential returns, market
4:02:12
demand and resource allocation. So let's take example of um handset mobiles. So
4:02:17
you have a product portfolio for example uh in uh let's take example of Xiaomi
4:02:23
Redmi and they have a product portfolio which has uh 5G based products as a one
4:02:30
of the product portfolio and then within 5G they have multiple product line one multiple products basically one is uh
4:02:36
11, Redmi 11, Redmi 12, Redmi 13, Redmi 14. So but on top of it basically each
4:02:43
product will have their own product manager but all of them are reporting to a group product manager. Group product
4:02:48
manager is working as a portfolio manager for 5G products. So what he will
4:02:53
do he will prioritize which product to focus based on potential return market demand and resource allocation. So he
4:03:00
will see that market is uh um we are going to launch Redmi Xiaomi 14 into the
4:03:08
market. So considering mark potential returns he will focus more uh resources
4:03:13
on um Redmi 14. However for 13 and 12 he will give basic minimum resource or
4:03:19
support required in order to sustain the market. So that's how he will prioritize it. So within his portfolio he will have
4:03:26
any number of products and within that products which product should give more
4:03:32
priority based on uh return on investment based on market demand and accordingly he will finalize the budget
4:03:38
and resources. So that's the prioritization aspect. Uh Mujib
4:03:44
importance of product portfolio management. Um better decision making helps business uh to make uh datadriven
4:03:52
decisions about product development and resource allocation. Improved profitability since uh by focusing on
4:03:58
the right products reducing the investment on underperforming ones. PPM portfolio manager can improve the
4:04:04
overall profitability. Innovative management encourage a balance between innovation, new product development and
4:04:10
sustaining existing products. Market responsiveness
4:04:16
ensures the product portfolio evolves with the market trends and customer preferences by maintaining at the end
4:04:22
you are ensuring that you are maintaining competitive advantage. Example, a smartphone company might use
4:04:28
a portfolio management to decide how much investment is its existing flagship model. a low
4:04:35
cost model and future technology innovations like a foldable phones by assessing market trends, customer
4:04:41
demands, profitability, they can allocate resources to ensure balanced and successful product
4:04:47
portfolio. So yeah, so you have some products which
4:04:52
are like uh old generation products. So you have current generation products and you have new generation products. So
4:04:59
portfolio manager will ensure that uh there is a synergy between all these three products and he will prioritize
4:05:05
the resources budgeting requirement in order to capture maximum uh revenue for the organization on a portfolio basis.
4:05:12
So that's the roles and responsibility of a portfolio manager. Typical designations for a port a portfolio
4:05:18
managers are group product manager, senior group product managers and director is also kind of uh
4:05:25
portfolio manager but within director I think director handles multiple product portfolio. Director typically is product
4:05:32
line head. So if you look at the chronologically on top you have product line within that product line you have
4:05:38
multiple product portfolios within that portfolios you have multiple products and there is a product manager is for
4:05:45
individual products he reports to group product manager which is uh product portfolio manager followed by who
4:05:52
reports to director who is product line manager that's how it is essentially it is same as that of a product manager
4:05:58
however it is just for group of products just a quick info guys intellipath

4:06:44
what we need to cover in cover in phase number two. So, phase number two title is product strategy and value
4:06:49
proposition. We are targeting module number nine. So, the module number nine you know the title is product features
4:06:55
and product lines. So essentially we are trying to understand what is the meaning of product feature, what is the meaning
4:07:01
of product mix, what is the meaning of product lines and uh you know how to
4:07:07
design a product features, how to develop a product specifications, what is the meaning of product line
4:07:13
extension, what does product line modification means? Product portfolio management tools. This again it's about
4:07:21
uh a set of tools which we need to use it for product portfolio management. But again all those tools we covered in
4:07:28
module number seven. So this portion we will skip. We will have a case study about Apple's product line strategy. So
4:07:34
what are the products Apple has? How many product lines they has? What kind
4:07:39
of product portfolio they have. So we have very good case study. Then uh we will understand evaluating
4:07:46
product features for customer fit. So
4:07:51
the overview for this topic is we'll try to understand how best how can how can
4:07:57
we assess that how which are all the features are there which are basically fit for customer requirement. So how to
Understanding Product Features
4:08:04
evaluate the product and customer fit. So that we will try to understand over here. And then last point is strategic
4:08:11
decisions on product lines. So these are the topics which we will try to cover today along with the case study from
4:08:18
Apple product features and product lines. Okay. So what is product feature?
4:08:23
Definition says a product feature is a distinctive characteristics or a functionality within the product that
4:08:30
delivers a benefit to the end user. A features uh make up the core of what
4:08:36
product does and they drive user experience. Some features are critical
4:08:41
to the critical to the product's main function while other are designed to enhance experience or differentiate the
4:08:48
product from competitors. It's kind of a definition of a product feature. But let's keep it simple. Product features
4:08:54
is basically these are the characteristics or functionality within the product which delivers benefit or
4:09:00
value to the end customer. This is called as a product feature. What are the different types of product features? So product features can be categorized
4:09:06
into I think A, B, C, D, E, F. six ways uh core features. Core features are kind
4:09:11
of essential functionalities without which uh product wouldn't serve its primary purpose. These are often called
4:09:19
as must-h have features elements that fulfill products basic promise to the user. So for example, if you are looking
4:09:26
at WhatsApp message, the primary feature must have feature is it should have the ability to send and receive messages in
4:09:33
messaging app. This is the core feature basic feature. placing an order in a
4:09:38
food delivery application. If you look at Zomato or if you look at Swiggy, what is the what are the core features? You
4:09:44
should be able to place a order from your preferred restaurant. It is a core feature. Then you have you know
4:09:50
secondary features. These are the complimentary features complimentary to the core features but they are not
4:09:56
critical to the product's fundamental use. So they improve user experience or
4:10:01
offer additional convenience. So for example if you take at WhatsApp
4:10:07
image so having you can able to create emoji and you can share the reactions. This is secondary features it will
4:10:13
enhance the user experience. And if you like to get if you look at uh Zumato or
4:10:19
Swiggy scheduling the delivery times okay I I would like to deliver a pizza and I want it to be delivered at 9 to
4:10:26
9:15 p.m. So that kind of feature scheduling scheduling a delivery time. It is a secondary feature. It's not a
4:10:32
core feature. very very simple easy to understand. Then we have one more way to
4:10:37
categorize the feature or differentiating features features. Uh so basically differentiating features are
4:10:44
set the products apart from competitor. So this can create a unique selling point. We call it as USP and often
4:10:51
become the reason why user choose one product over another. So for
4:10:57
example, if you go to Instagram's uh story features allowing users to share
4:11:03
uh disappearing content, it's kind of differentiating feature. Spotify's personalized playlist like a discovery
4:11:10
discover weekly, you know, weekly they refresh the list based on users
4:11:16
listening habits. So it is kind of differentiating features. So that's how Spotify differentiate itself from Jio7
4:11:23
or other platforms or I think uh sheal have mentioned the Netflix
4:11:29
why it is they have the original content and personalized recommendation
4:11:34
localized content. So these are differentiating characteristic of a feature. Uh I think this is very clear
4:11:40
UIUX features. So these features are related to user interface and user experience while they are not add to the
4:11:47
functionality add new functionality they improve how user interact with the product making it more intuitive and
4:11:53
visually appealing. So drag and drop functionality for a design tool for example Figma they have this drag and
4:11:59
drop functionality. Um you go to you know any application they provide the dark mode application to reduce the eye
4:12:05
strain. So all those things are called as the UI UX related feature. Again there are another ways to categorize
4:12:12
features, technical features, backend features. So these are the hidden from end user but they are crucial for
4:12:18
product performance, security and reliability or serverside encryption for data privacy, data security. Uh load
4:12:25
balancing algorithm that improves app speed and scalability. So these are kind of a backend features. So that is
4:12:31
another way to classify it. Uh another way is called as innovative features. So these are the new features cutting edge
4:12:37
features that push the boundaries of what the product can do often solve the problems that they were previously
4:12:44
unavailable. So AI AI powered image recognition for in Google photos. So you
4:12:49
can see you know it will do the face recognition and it will tell it it can
4:12:55
create autos for your memories. So that's kind of
4:13:00
innovative feature. Uh another example is uh augmented reality shopping in IKEA
4:13:06
app. So letting users to visualize furnitureures by sitting at your h by sitting at your home. So this is
4:13:13
innovative features. So these are the different different ways. So intention here is you you will
4:13:19
get a good idea about what is product feature and what are the different types of features core features, secondary
4:13:25
feature, differentiating UIUX. There is a lot of overlap you know innovative can be a technical feature technical can be
4:13:31
a differentiating feature but just try to understand those terminologies because uh once you are product manager
4:13:37
you should be able to justify what what category of uh features you are trying
4:13:43
to push it for your product. So these are the very much uh generally used
4:13:48
terms in product management world about uh categorization of features core secondary differentiating UIUX technical
4:13:56
backend features innovative features understanding the feature through value. So customer focused features and
4:14:02
business focused features. So customer focused features. So these are the features directly address the needs
4:14:08
problems or uh the pain points of end user. The value they offer should be
4:14:13
clear and directly linked to improve the user's life or making task easier. So
4:14:19
these features basically so let's take example one click check out feature in e-commerce
4:14:25
reducing friction in the purchasing process. So single tap you know you have those uh non-touch uh credit cards if
4:14:33
you want to do the purchasing for less than 5k. So this kind of customer focused features which are basically
4:14:41
addressing customer pain points and then you have another category called as a business focused features. So these are fe these are the features align with
4:14:47
product renew your subscription you'll get a keep you know subscription reminder. So these are even though they
4:14:53
are customer focused but if you see the intention is uh intention is customer
4:14:59
should renew their subscription. So these are more towards business focused features. So that's how they another way
4:15:05
to categorize the feature. Yeah. But good I think see if you look at the way in which class discussion is happening
4:15:11
you know we have I think it will take some time or maybe I'll take this one later. There are different ways in which
4:15:17
GPA makes the money. I I can I can answer it. Yeah maybe later. Yeah. Okay.
4:15:22
So let's go to number four. Identifying valuable features. So once you have you know uh
4:15:30
have a list of the features and then accordingly okay which are all those features are valuable. So understanding
4:15:36
the customer pain points uh desires behaviors through surveys, interviews and usability test. This is what
4:15:42
marketing room does and accordingly you will get a customer requirement and according you will create a list of
4:15:47
features. Thally you will check what kind of features are available in competitor's product. By studying what
4:15:54
features competitors offers, you can identify the areas where your product can innovate or differentiate itself and
4:16:00
datadriven decisions features that uses metrics uh and user feedback provide
4:16:06
critical insights into which features are most valuable and where improvements can be can be made. So essentially you
4:16:15
launched a product and you would like to see which features are valuable for the end customer. So straight away I would
4:16:20
say use Google Analytics give you access for your application to Google Analytics. Google Analytics can tell you
4:16:27
in a month how many times this feature has been used. So based on that you can able to clearly identify that okay which
4:16:35
are all the features customer is perceiving as valuable from their perspective. Even though you know before
4:16:40
developing that feature you have done all those market survey understood customer requirement but once you have
4:16:45
launched the product you would like to check okay whether customer is seeing the value or not that's where you can do
4:16:51
the KPI based analysis and you can check uh whether really customers are seeing the value and one of the way to check
4:16:59
that one is how many times customers are using that feature. So usage per customer and number of customers. So we
4:17:06
have again multiple KPI matrices uh APU and all those things. So based on those KPIs we can check we can able to clearly
4:17:14
define how many of those available features are valuable from customer perspective. Feature prioritization um
4:17:21
again we have multiple models which we are going to talk in the next next slide. So just to give overview not all
4:17:28
features are should be developed at once because you have limited resources. Prioritizing the feature is very very
4:17:34
important and product manager is the one who will decide which features to be implemented in that particular product
4:17:40
and uh what are the variables he will see what kind of value it is adding to the customer what kind of value it is
4:17:45
adding to your business and the physibility is the feature is realistic
4:17:50
with current resources timelines and technology and based on that he will have the assessment and again based on
4:17:56
that he will create a list of features to be implemented in a given product but
4:18:01
featur Feature prioritization models we are going to discuss in next slides. Overall what is the life cycle of a
4:18:08
feature? So ideation you know brainstorming the new feature based on customer needs, market trends,
4:18:14
competitive analysis. It's ideation phase. Once you decided that okay you
4:18:19
understood customer requirements you design the feature you do the development. How will you do it? You create a prototype. You can have MVP,
4:18:27
you cannot have MVP based on the scope of that feature and you'll gather the feedback and based on that you will
4:18:32
finalize which some of the prototype ideas to be included into the final product. Then you launch the feature
4:18:40
releasing the feature to users and prompting promoting it to ensure adoption and
4:18:46
optimization. Once you actually launch it once you user actually started using it based on the user feedback you will
4:18:52
optimize it. But at the end last point is feature documentation. To ensure clarity and alignment feature should be
4:18:59
documented in in the form of user stories, technical specifications or wireframe diagram. Uh this helps
4:19:05
communicate the vision and details of the feature to the development team, stakeholders and designers. Not only
4:19:11
about features. So all the things what you do as a product manager, you should have a very good documentation about uh
4:19:17
if you make a decisions, please document it. Please document the justification because those things will be very very
4:19:23
important if you want to go back and check why you made a decision for your product. So these are you know top level
4:19:29
information about the feature but let's now try to go in detail and check how typically product manager do the feature
4:19:36
prioritization understanding the feature product feature prioritization. So feature
4:19:42
prioritization is a critical aspect of a product manager as we discussed as it helps team to decide which features to
Product Feature Prioritization
4:19:48
develop first based on their potential impact alignment with the business goals. These are there are multiple
4:19:53
frameworks available for prioritization. Couple of frameworks are as follows. Basically the first one is Moscow method
4:20:01
wherein uh M stands for must have, S stands for should have, C stands for could have and W stands for won't have
4:20:09
for now. So must is uh feature that are essential for a product to work without
4:20:15
them product cannot function. Yes, basically important features but not a
4:20:21
critical uh should be included but uh can be de prioritized you know if there
4:20:26
are some constraints would have features that are kind of a nice to have but not
4:20:31
necessarily. They can be considered if time and resources allows and W
4:20:36
basically features that are not at all relevant to the current iteration but
4:20:41
might be considered for future for future scope. So this is the framework
4:20:47
called as Moscow method. Uh let's try to understand you know with the help of uh e-commerce application. Let's take
4:20:53
example of Amazon Prime. uh must have uh what you should have user registration
4:20:59
feature should have a login without this one user cannot access the app they cannot place the order product search
4:21:07
you know uh Amazon you are expected to have a good search features ability for
4:21:12
users to search the products because it is the core functionality I should have
4:21:18
you know should have is uh product reviews and ratings these features add value while by helping user users to
4:21:25
make informed purchasing decisions but it is not critical for the app's
4:21:30
functionality. Uh you know it could be you have you know cart as a feature wish list user should be able to save
4:21:36
products for later but uh the app can't app app can function without having a
4:21:42
card function cart functionality. So this falls under should have. I could
4:21:47
have basically a social sharing uh sharing uh letting user share products
4:21:52
on social media is nice to have features but not essential for app score
4:21:58
functionality. Uh multiple payments options add convenience but it is not critical. As long as basic payments
4:22:04
options are available as long as you know you support UPI it's good enough. Amazon pay or you know PTM wallet based
4:22:12
payment would have you know better to have if at all doesn't have it's okay not a big
4:22:17
problem won't have for now augmented reality product visualization
4:22:22
uh it's always recommended to become to be innovative but it is not necessary at
4:22:28
this point of time for initial launch you can think of uh AR based feature in
4:22:33
future in basically as a part of future scope so augmented reality based feature
4:22:39
is called considered as a won't have. So that's how you categorize e-commerce based features must have, should have,
4:22:46
could have, won't have. So when do we when product manager will use this fe you know this method. So you as a
4:22:53
product manager just imagine a scenario you want to develop a new product development. You have created a survey.
4:22:59
You asked marketing team okay go and talk to end customer try to understand their painoint areas. So marketing team
4:23:05
went and they create they kind of captured customer painoint areas. Based on that you you you analyze those
4:23:10
painoint areas and you came up with a feature list. Okay this feature solves this pin point area. This feature
4:23:17
feature one solves pinpoint area one feature two solves pinpoint area two and
4:23:22
now you have big list of features but you can't start development and you can't implement all the features in your
4:23:28
product. So as a product manager you need to prioritize it and this is the framework wherein you will decide which
4:23:35
features to be prioritized. Go for must have if all the features if still you have resources go for should have still
4:23:42
you have resources go for could have that's the priority you should you need to follow very subjective analysis moco
4:23:49
method okay let's go to next framework I like this one uh rice coing because this
4:23:56
is uh more objective you know being a engineering background I like working
4:24:01
with numbers and Moscow if you see it's subjective or I think it is must have
4:24:08
but you know you I you might think it is it it falls under should have category so there is a good amount of
4:24:13
subjectivity in Moscow method but if you look at rice model it has actual numbers
4:24:20
so let's try to understand what does R I stands for so R stands for reach I
4:24:26
stands for impact C stands for confidence and E stands for effort so
4:24:32
it's a datadriven framework designed to objectively prioritize has a feature based on scoring models. So reach what
4:24:39
what is the meaning of reach? How many users or customers will the feature
4:24:45
impact measured by number of users, transactions or uh sessions affected. So
4:24:52
it talks about absolute count. How many users are going to use these features? Second point, the impact. How much
4:24:59
impact will this feature have on the user experience or overall business goals? Typically you know you can
4:25:06
categorize impact from 0 to 5 or 0 to 10. You can have your own
4:25:12
scale but you have to be consistent and uh they say you know the
4:25:18
what do you call the resolution is.5 but typically it's very difficult to
4:25:23
categorize okay 1.25 versus 1.5. So what typically industry does is when they use
4:25:29
this rice model is they they use resolution as 0.5 not 0.25. So 1.52 2.53
4:25:35
3.54 so and and so forth. So impact how much impact will this feature has on user
4:25:41
experience on or on business goals. Next factor is confidence. How confident
4:25:48
are you in the accuracy of your reach and impact estimates? Uh so it is the
4:25:54
percentage value. So 80%age indicates strong confidence. So you might have you know you might have some assumptions
4:26:01
when you calculate the reach and impact. So you are expected to put the confidence value. So again it will take
4:26:08
out the subjectivity. So you might have so you you might have some assumptions.
4:26:13
Okay how many customers are going to use this features. So I have my assumptions. I feel that uh my forecasted data shows
4:26:20
that I might get 100 new customers per month because since if I launch this feature but that might not be accurate.
4:26:27
So my question to be asked is how much confident are you in terms of percentage that 100 customers you are going to get
4:26:35
by implementing this new features. So that's where that objectivity subjectivity is removed by adding the
4:26:41
confidence factor as a C. And the last one is effort. How much work is required
4:26:46
to implement these features? So how much resources are required in terms of manpowers, inputs of budget, person
4:26:53
hours, days, weeks. So you you divide basically you multiply reach into impact
4:26:59
into confidence and you divide it by efforts. So that's how you will get a rice score. Rice is effective for
4:27:06
datadriven teams that uh want balanced high impact features with their development efforts.
4:27:12
So that's the concept to give one example. So let's take example of uh
4:27:18
task management app. Remember Sophia I know first case study she was she has
4:27:23
developed a product which was focusing on project management applications similar category task management
4:27:29
application and they decided that okay I would like to develop this feature task
4:27:35
management uh feature uh task management application and it will have three features. Uh first feature is the task
4:27:41
reminder project template and advanced reporting. So let's take case of task
4:27:47
reminder and uh the thing is if I implement this feature I can expect that
4:27:54
uh 800 users will get benefited because of this feature. The impact of this feature is uh I feel there is a strong
4:28:00
impact. I given the rating as three because it address uh a kind of a basic
4:28:06
pain point from customer perspective. There is a lot of need in the market for task reminders. So impact is considered
4:28:13
as three and I'm fairly confident that I my estim estimates are correct because I have done thorough research. I have good
4:28:19
data which justify that my reach numbers and impact numbers are fairly accurate and then I worked with engineering team.
4:28:26
I checked okay how much efforts are required in order to implement this task reminder feature in my task management
4:28:33
application. then I feel that it needs um two person weeks you know one person
4:28:40
working for two weeks I can able to develop this feature develop testing everything so efforts required two
4:28:45
person weeks so accordingly uh task reminder with highest basically I I have
4:28:51
this score as 1080 and then if I do the similar analysis for project templates
4:28:56
advanced reporting I get uh similar rice scores and based on these things I find
4:29:02
that uh task reminder should be the First feature which we should prioritize followed by project template followed by
4:29:09
advanced reporting. This is widely being used framework across uh many companies,
4:29:15
many industries I would say because it is very much uh objective and uh people
4:29:21
like objective data ra IC how to calculate scores methods frameworks
4:29:27
coming in next slide but uh before going to that okay so let's go to number three
4:29:34
it's a kano model very I think not very much different than that of Moscow model
4:29:40
so Here ko model helps prioritize the features by categorizing them on customer satisfaction and the degree of
4:29:46
implementation. So divides feature into five categories. The first one is the basic needs. Uh here if you compare it
4:29:54
with Moscow it is uh m most features. These are the features uh user expects
4:29:59
and the and and if they are in their absence leads to dissatisfaction in basic features. One of the example
4:30:05
security, stability and all those things what we discussed here basic features must have. Then second category what KO
4:30:12
says is performance needs. So the more of these features you provide the more set you know faster hold loading times
4:30:19
better performance. So these are performance related features. Third one is excitement needs um falls
4:30:26
under delight category features that user don't expect but would love when
4:30:32
they are present. innovative surprise surpassing features. So this falls under
4:30:37
uh delight category which falls which basically cater the excitement needs of customer. Next one are indifferent
4:30:45
features. So these features don't significantly impact uh satisfaction
4:30:50
and the last one is reverse features. So features that can actually lead to dissatisfaction if present.
4:30:58
So it's like a feature overload. Too many tabs on the on the home screen, too
4:31:05
many unnecessary notifications. It is reverse features. So in cono you have a category called as a reverse feature
4:31:11
which basically tells that don't have category. You should not be implementing this one use case. Cono model
4:31:17
particularly useful for balancing user expectations and identifying delighter
4:31:22
features that can give competitive edge. So let's take couple of example. So must
4:31:28
be is a basic uh video playback. So essential features without without this
4:31:34
one app is unusable. Uh performance HD streaming you know if you are giving the
4:31:41
HD streaming feature compatibility. So it is performance based performance
4:31:46
related features. So the more you provide the happier user be excitement feature uh you know like kind of you can
4:31:54
able to download the videos for offline viewing it is uh falls under delight
4:32:00
category it is unexpected but highly appreciated by users indifferent uh
4:32:06
customer themes for UI user don't care much whether the feature is present or not if it is there good to have if it is
4:32:12
not there it's okay user can able to manage it's not a specific demand from user After that I would like to
4:32:18
customize my theme for user interface and reverse uh autoplaying next video.
4:32:24
So here they are telling okay some users don't like auto play it is like annoying for them. So this leads to
4:32:30
dissatisfaction. So please don't implement uh autoplaying feature. So this is the way in which they categorize
4:32:37
the feature and uh basically they go for must have followed by performance
4:32:44
followed by excitement. So that's the priority they use it indifferent and reverse indifferent if if at all the
4:32:50
resources available go for indifferent otherwise don't go for indifferent. So video playback as we discussed this
4:32:56
feature must be features user expects video playback without it they would uh
4:33:02
be extremely dissatisfied. Uh download for offline application this is
4:33:07
excitement feature user may not expect this but when it is present it significantly boost the satisfaction.
4:33:13
Result platform should focus on must be features followed by performance followed by excitement. So that's the
4:33:20
priority. So this is another way in which you can categorize it. Uh not very
4:33:25
much famous mostly people use Moscow or rice. Cano okay I think whatever we can
4:33:31
able to do it in Moscow same thing you can able to do it in Cano also. Okay. Another another methodology I would say.
4:33:38
And uh this is another one. It is uh it is called as value versus complexity.
4:33:44
Impact versus effort. So let's try to understand uh last model. Fourth one uh
4:33:49
value versus complexity. This is very very I think this is widely being used. You know everybody will have you know
4:33:56
very good understanding about what kind of value it is adding to the customer and what is the complexity of developing
4:34:01
this one. The framework plots the feature on matrix that compares the potential business or user value against
4:34:09
the complexity or efforts required to implement it. So value versus efforts the matrix divided into four quadrants
4:34:16
you know. So okay in fact I can I cannot draw no. So
4:34:23
let's imagine 2x2 matrix one vertical line one horizontal line and um
4:34:30
the top right side is wherein both axis are high high wherein it calls as uh big
4:34:37
bet. So the definition of big bet is high value high effort. So these are
4:34:42
important but require significant investments because these are going to add lot of value but it requires lot of
4:34:48
investment. So second quadrant wherein the value is uh high but the efforts are low
4:34:55
complexity is low. So it is called as a quick win wherein the value is very high
4:35:00
but the efforts required to implement are very low. So this should be prioritized first because these are kind of a high value addition with very low
4:35:09
efforts. So prioritize it get it implemented. The next one is quadrant number three wherein the value is low
4:35:16
low basically value what what value you are going to add is also low and the effort required to implement it is also
4:35:23
low. So these are kind of a low low is called as a low hanging fruit. So this can be added if time permits. If there
4:35:29
is no extra resources you can eliminate them. And the last one is uh you are
4:35:34
going to add very low value but it requires lot of efforts in order to implement this feature. So the
4:35:40
terminology is money pits. So they should be avoided. So that's how they
4:35:46
kind of categorized all features into four category. A quick win high value
4:35:52
low complexity go for it. Prioritize them. Big bets wherein the value is high
4:35:58
but the complexity is very low. So custom workflow let's take example of
4:36:04
project management. Uh so drag and drop kind of feature value is very high. people would like to use this feature
4:36:10
and complexity is very low. Drag and drop developing a drag drag and drop feature won't take more uh engineering
4:36:16
resources. So it falls under quick win. Uh let's take case of custom workflow. So customized workflow for individual
4:36:23
users. So value is very high. I would like to use I would like to see a customized workflow for my requirement.
4:36:30
But in order to develop a customized workflow feature, it it takes lot of efforts. So this falls under big bet
4:36:36
wherein these are important but these needs significant amount of efforts. Uh low low basically low hanging fruits
4:36:42
colorcoded labels you know the value is low if it is there it's okay if it is not there who cares complexity is also
4:36:49
low so if you have additional efforts additional resources go for low low category low hanging fruit. And the next
4:36:56
one is AI powered uh task assignment wherein um if I have AIdriven task
4:37:04
assignment does it add lot of value? Okay, it's add some value but not a lot
4:37:09
but you know I need to incorporate AI based algorithm the efforts required are very high. So I don't want to implement
4:37:15
it. So that's this is another way in which you can categorize it. So quick win drag and drop high value user can
4:37:21
easily rearrange the task and low complexity easy to implement it big bets custom workflow high value but requires
4:37:28
significant development making it more strategic long-term investment money bits AI task it's highly complex but
4:37:35
doesn't add significant value and result focus on quick wins high value low
4:37:40
efforts uh result basically focus on quick wins go for uh high value low
4:37:45
complexity followed by big bets and if at resources are available go for uh low
4:37:51
hanging fruit but try to avoid money pit. So this is the another way of
4:37:56
classification but so we have seen three models Moscow,
4:38:01
Kano and uh value versus complexity. All of three are very subjective based
4:38:07
on subjective analysis of a product manager and rice which is very much objective. I would prefer rice but again
4:38:14
it depends upon uh individual's choices and individual's scenario where they would like to use it but uh if as long
4:38:21
as you know how to use it you have to use uh at least one of them in your
4:38:27
project and when you are a product manager working as a product manager you should have good grip over uh at least
4:38:34
one of the framework so that you can you can consistently use it. simple 2x2
4:38:40
matrix on one axis low value high value y-axis low complexity high complexity
4:38:46
and accordingly you categorized big feature list into these four four uh
4:38:52
quadrants and just to go back to prais's question what kind of information I need so in order to start actually working on
4:39:00
this model you need to have the information about what kind of value it is adding to the end customer and you have to have the feedback from
4:39:06
engineering team about the complexity of implementing this feature So once you have these things you can
4:39:11
able to start working on this model. So to summarize Moscow focuses on
4:39:16
essentials versus nice to have features. Rise uses datadriven scoring model for feature prioritization. Cano prioritize
4:39:24
prioritizes based on user satisfaction and expectation. Value versus complexity balances feature value against
4:39:30
complexity of implementation. So it's up to you which one you would like to use it. But these are uh the most famous
4:39:37
four models for feature prioritization in product management uh community.
4:39:43
Okay. So now let's see the designing product features and specifications.
4:39:49
Okay. So is what we are trying to learn here is that okay we understood feature prioritization but how do you come up
4:39:56
until feature prioritization. So capturing product features and specifications from voice of customer is
Designing Product Features and Specifications
4:40:02
a critical process for a product manager to ensure that product meets the customer expectations customer needs. So
4:40:08
voice of customer it's again a very well-known terminology in product management world. VC voice of customer
4:40:14
voice of customer refers to gathering feedback insights and preferences directly from customers to understand
4:40:19
their desires their pain point you know their expectations. uh by using insight by using this
4:40:26
insights product manager can create a feature that uh resonates with user and align with business objectives. So the
4:40:32
first step in developing any product or any feature is uh marketing team will
4:40:38
work with the end customers in order to capture the customer pain points. So what are the different ways in which uh
4:40:45
marketing marketing team will collect the voice of customer is um customer interviews you know conducting
4:40:51
one-on-one customer interviews to understand customer pain points their expectations I know what kind of desired
4:40:57
features they would like to have in your product uh typically they go for open-ended questions you know uh
4:41:02
customers to freely express their needs so what kind of questions they ask you know what challenges do you face with
4:41:09
the current generation products and they will ask basically Okay, they will listen then and they will record their
4:41:15
what kind of information or answer they are giving. So that's the customer interviews. Second one is the surveys
4:41:21
and questionaers. Use structured surveys to ask targeted questions about uh product usage, desired features,
4:41:28
customer satisfactions. Survey can be distributed via email, via in applications or social media. So what
4:41:33
features you would like to see in our next update? So in surveys you can have you know open-ended question wherein you
4:41:40
will give a space wherein customer can write their subjective feedback plus you can have some you know objectives
4:41:46
basically options also option A option B option C and last option could be something else please type it. So like
4:41:51
that you create a survey you are you basically along with marketing team you will create a survey float that survey
4:41:57
and you seek input from customer. So that's the second way. Third one is focus group. Organize a small group uh
4:42:04
discussions with the target users to gather the qualitative insights on a
4:42:09
product features, usability and area of improvement. Focus group help identify
4:42:15
shared user uh experiences and pain points. So typically focus group uh they
4:42:20
involve uh the customers who knows about the product current generation product very well and who would like to help
4:42:27
your organization on providing the expectation for our new generation product. Uh customer feedback it could
4:42:34
be either in app or in online customer collects the feedback uh collect the c feedback directly within the app through
4:42:40
feedback forms on your website. This method captures the real-time opinions on the product features or experiences.
4:42:48
User can leave feedback on specified features as we would recommend would you
4:42:53
recommend this product? What would you make it better? So you know you can have
4:42:59
this kind of uh questions and then your customer can provide the feedback. In fact your current generation product
4:43:06
reviews on current generation product also will will help a lot. You'll try to understand which are all those areas
4:43:11
where in customer is not happy. At least you have that information. Customer might not say you might not get the
4:43:17
information about what you would like state to be. However, those features wherein customer is not happy,
4:43:23
dissatisfied, you can have those list of features which you can incorporate in developing new generation products.
4:43:29
Again you can go for social media listening you know monitor uh discussions on social platforms like a
4:43:36
Twitter, LinkedIn uh ready to capture the unfiltered
4:43:41
customer opinions and trends around your product. Example track mention of your
4:43:46
product and analyze customer comments and complaints. So you ask um a particular person to talk about your
4:43:53
product and then just go through what kind of comments he's getting. It's a good way to get uh unfiltered feedback.
4:43:59
So the important word word here is unfiltered customer opinions. So here
4:44:04
the major majority of the thing is most of the cases you don't get a genuine customer feedback because marketing team
4:44:11
or somebody will uh sugarcoat it or they will alter it. So product manager should
4:44:17
always ask unfiltered customer feedback because that will give lot of
4:44:22
information more insights than modified one or you know kind of sugared customer
4:44:28
support tickets analyze the recurring issues and feedbacks received at customer support team you have current
4:44:34
generation product similar to what I have mentioned for product reviews on uh
4:44:40
Google platform or um Google playlist platform or some other platforms. Similarly, you can have very good
4:44:46
insights from your customer service team. You can check with them what kind of issues you are getting, frequent
4:44:51
issues you are getting more from customers and what's the level of frustration
4:44:57
from customer on that feature. So customer often reports problems missing features through their through this
4:45:04
customer support channels. They also marketing team also have this net promoter score NPS survey. NPS
4:45:11
survey to gauge the customer satisfaction and understand what uh
4:45:17
detractors and uh promoters are saying about the product on a scale
4:45:22
of 1 to 10. How likely you would recommend our product to your friends. So such kind of questions are covered in
4:45:30
the surveys and you will ask the rating from 1 to 10. In fact, you have the possibility to add descriptive answers.
4:45:37
product reviews and rating as we discussed uh user analytics, user uh usage patterns. So through Google
4:45:43
Analytics, I think somebody was mentioning about mix panel. So you can take a reference of those platforms and
4:45:49
you can check what kind of comments you are getting, what kind of suggestions you are getting. So essentially you will do all those things in order to capture
4:45:56
VOC voice of customer. So this is the first trigger for a product manager. You
4:46:02
will ask marketing team to all do all those things and you'll you'll capture VOCC from different different platforms
4:46:08
and uh that basically completes the stage. Step number one collecting the voice of customer.
4:46:16
So this is how you have collected voice of customer and uh analyzing and interpreting the voice of customer data.
4:46:22
So once voice of customer data is collected product manager need to analyze it to extract valuable insights
4:46:29
about customer needs and translate them into actionable product features and specifications. So how he does it as I
4:46:36
told you know identify patterns and trends. Group a similar feedback from multiple customers to identify common
4:46:42
pain points features request or areas of improvement. For instance in many uh
4:46:48
users are asking for better search functionality. it becomes a key insight. So what is expected in that report? 50
4:46:54
percentage of users mentioned difficult difficulty in finding the product using the current search function. So this is
4:47:00
the uh insight what you are getting from voice of customer where you are putting the actual numbers. Okay. A good amount
4:47:07
of customers are complaining about your current uh search functionality. Second, so that's how you have create gone
4:47:14
through the details and you have created a patterns and trends. Second point is categorize the feedback. Organize the
4:47:19
feedback into categories such as uh okay usability issues are categorized somewhere feature related requests
4:47:26
somewhere bug fixes somewhere in one more one category and this helps in
4:47:31
prioritizing the area of a focus. So organize the feedback in categories like
4:47:36
performance issues, feature request, ease of use, bug fixes like that you can
4:47:41
create a multiple categories for those feedback. Then third one is the prioritize user problem. Not all
4:47:47
customer requests are equal. Identify the most impactful problems that align with uh business goals. Use
4:47:55
prioritization frameworks. You know this is about you know what we learned Moscow rise to decide which features should be
4:48:01
tackled first. So it's about once you have the feature list how to prioritize it. That's that's what we have learned in last last section. Segment feedback
4:48:10
by user persona. That's another way. Different customer segments have different needs. segment feedback based
4:48:16
on user persona. For example, power users versus new users, enterprise application versus uh uh retail
4:48:24
customers to understand how their needs vary. Example, power users request more
4:48:30
advanced reporting while new users wants a simple onboarding process. So this is
4:48:36
another way of categorizing it. So I got the feedback from corporate customer and
4:48:41
I get this feedback. I got a customer feedback from real customer. I got this feedback. So accordingly you can able to
4:48:47
create a feature and in the note section you can put okay this feature is focused on corporate application. This feature
4:48:53
is focused on um retail applications. What is expected from product manager is
4:48:58
you should do a quantitative analysis from surveys. Quantitative analysis to measure the relative importance of a
4:49:04
feature satisfaction levels frequency of a certain request. You can use tools
4:49:09
like a Google form, survey monkey who can provide this information and um qualitative analysis also basically you
4:49:16
are going through the interviews, group focus group discussions. Use uh thematic analysis to identify recurring themes
4:49:22
and suggestions in interview data. Uh you can use softwares like uh NVO or
4:49:29
doubt can help categorize the qualitative data. So essentially what
4:49:34
you are trying to do is that whatever data you have captured you are analyzing it and trying to understand the impact. You are creating a pattern. you are
4:49:41
categorizing them and uh based on that you you're coming up with a list of features which needs to be implemented
4:49:48
and which needs to be prioritized and once priority is defined you will take it forward as I discussed with Mujib
4:49:55
that uh once you decided that I would like to implement this top 10 features followed with the vision document once
4:50:01
vision is approved once you got approval for your product you will start working with engineering team in order to
4:50:06
develop those uh features then again divided into multiple sprints. Each
4:50:12
sprints will have some features. And now when it comes to actual implementation, you would like to refine the problem
4:50:20
statement wherein you will again go back to marketing team and check what kind of uh further details they can able to
4:50:25
provide which will be helpful in order to come up with the right feature specifications which we are going to
4:50:32
talk in the next slide. However, is it clear how to collect the data and how to
4:50:37
analyze the voice of customer data? Now you have got voice of customer. You have you know kind of categorized it created
4:50:43
a summary clusters patterns. Now how are you going to translate them into product
4:50:49
features and specifications. After analyzing voice of customer product manager translate customer needs into
4:50:55
actionable product features and detailed specifications. This process involves breaking down insights into specific
4:51:01
product functionalities. So step how are you going to do it? Step number one identify the core problem or the need.
4:51:08
After gathering the feedback, next step is to identify the core problem or the need that feedback sorry is um pointing
4:51:15
to problem identified. Customers are suggesting to track a task and deadlines
4:51:21
leading to missed deadlines and decreased productivity. So then they
4:51:26
need a way to they need a way to be reminded of a task and quickly checks on
4:51:34
approaching deadlines. a kind of a reminder task reminder. So you understood the customer feedback that
4:51:41
they they need a way to remind of the task and um once it once there is a
4:51:47
deadline basically there should be a uh some kind of message.
4:51:53
So like that you have identified the problem. Next step is define the user story. That's what I think Muji were
4:51:59
discussing. Once you have developed a problem, once you understood the problem statement, you have to represent that
4:52:06
problem statement in terms of a customer language. So they call it as a user
4:52:11
story. A user story are the short simple descriptive description of a feature. From users perspective, this is the very
4:52:18
simple definition of user story. This is short. This is very simple description of a feature from users perspective.
4:52:25
They help product managers clearly define what customer wants to achieve with this product or with this feature.
4:52:31
So typical user stories are as a team leader I want to receive notification for upcoming task deadlines so that I
4:52:38
can so that I don't miss them or another example is I want to view all task with
4:52:44
approaching deadlines so that I can prioritize them. So it is a single a short oneliner sentence which defines
4:52:52
exactly what's the customer need. So developing a user story is very very crucial because this is kind of a you
4:52:59
got lot of feedbacks you have done lot of analysis and this is the outcome coming up with the user story from a
4:53:05
voice of customer is important and that's where product manager will play very important role he will define those
4:53:11
user stories once user story is defined uh next point is creating a feature
4:53:17
requirement so based on user stories product manager can define specific feature needed to solve the identified
4:53:24
problem. So this is the user story. This is the problem statement. So he will decide he will define the feature which
4:53:30
will solve this problem statement which is defined in the user story. These are the requirements or functionality that
4:53:37
describe what the feature will do. So for example for this user story feature
4:53:42
requirement for task reminder the feature requirement is notification. The system should or will automatically send
4:53:49
a reminder notification to the task owner and assigne 2 days before the task is due. This is a feature customizable
4:53:57
reminder. So user can set the customizable a reminder request can be customized. It could be 2 hours, it
4:54:03
could be 1 day, 2 days, 1 week before. So it should be customizable. And basically a due date view on the
4:54:09
dashboard. If you have a dashboard, you know when all tasks are sorted by a due date with the task due date soon
4:54:16
highlighted as the top of the list. So these are a top feature level feature
4:54:22
requirements. So let me go back. You have conducted marketing survey documents. You have marketing survey you
4:54:28
conducted marketing interview conducted. You analyze that customer feedback. Put it in different clusters and basically
4:54:35
you understood the core problem statement or first problem statement. I would say and to define that problem
4:54:42
statement you came up with the user story. User story is a simple oneliner statement about what is that uh feature
4:54:49
from users perspective and then uh you are creating a feature feature name is
4:54:54
task reminder and uh you came up with the feature requirements a notification customizable reminder and due date view.
4:55:02
This is how you convert uh voice of customer into user story from user story
4:55:07
to features and from features to feature requirements in your uh respective
4:55:13
capstone project. It is expected that uh you will capture the voice of customer and uh you identify the patterns,
4:55:20
trends, categorize that feedback based on based on that you know come up with a problem statement, come up with a user
4:55:26
story, come up with a feature and come up with feature requirements. Let me move to the next step. Step number four.
4:55:32
So now fourth number step we are going one step further detail. It is about detail specifications. Okay. And uh now
4:55:40
it's time to break down the feature requirement into detail specifications that design team and development team
4:55:45
will follow to build the feature. Example of task reminder feature. So for example, feature name is task reminder.
4:55:52
Functionality is the system will automatically send a push notification
4:55:57
and an email to user for task approaching their due dates. Default
4:56:02
reminder is 2 days before the due date. See they have mentioned the default value is 2 days before the due date.
4:56:08
Option of user to configure the reminder for configurable options are 1 day or 1
4:56:13
week before the due date. So there are two only two configurable options are expected. So this is the core
4:56:19
functionality. What is expected in user interface function? Basically in UI you
4:56:24
should have a dashboard view. A task approaching the due date will be highlighted in yellow. The upcoming task
4:56:30
sections will list all the tasks sorted by due date uh with the soonest first
4:56:35
earliest first on the top. Basically this is about the dashboard view UI. Notification sending user can go to the
4:56:43
setting and select setting setting settings set settings section to customize when they receive the
4:56:49
reminders. So like that you have to customize functionality what you have mentioned you have to create a UI for
4:56:54
that customize section go to settings create this particular button uh click this particular button and accordingly
4:57:01
change the value to either to 1 day or 1 week notification example reminder task
4:57:06
prepare project report in 2 days. So this is kind of a sample example you are giving reminder task prepare project
4:57:13
report due in two days. So this kind of notification you will get it. So this is UI related uh details you have
4:57:20
mentioned. So you have written on top functionality details you have written UI related details. Now let's see performance related details.
4:57:26
Notification delivery should occur within 1 second of the reminder trigger time. Notification delivery should occur
4:57:34
within 1 second of the remainder trigger time. reminders must reach 95 percentage
4:57:40
of the users without failure. So this is the expected. So for example, there are
4:57:45
100 users. Because of some issues in your functionality, it might happen that 5%age of the users things are not
4:57:51
working properly. But uh on a top level, it is expected that at least 90% 95 percentage of the people uh you should
4:57:59
you should be able to provide the reminder. Acceptance criteria notifications are successfully sent to
4:58:05
all the users for task due in two days. Uh user can customize the timing of a
4:58:11
notification and receive the reminders based on their preferences. So this is the acceptance criteria. H case
4:58:18
basically what is the meaning of H case? So these are the scenarios. What happens if the user email address is incorrect
4:58:25
or invalid? So show the error message in the notification setting if the system
4:58:30
cannot send an email due to invalid address. So these are kind of things wherein if things doesn't go well what
4:58:37
kind of error message you would like to show. A scenario what happens if the task due date is changed after reminder
4:58:42
has already been sent. The system will cancel the original reminder and send a new one based on the updated due date
4:58:50
and dependencies. This feature is dependent upon existing notification service requires integration with u user
4:58:57
profile system for customer reminders. So these are uh detailed customer detail
4:59:04
specifications. So what I say uh for step number four product manager will so
4:59:11
it is not whole and sole responsibility of product manager to understand the to write the detailed specifications. He
4:59:17
will get help from uh engineering team because they have the template. What is the functionality? What are the requirements for UI? What are the
4:59:23
performance related requirements? What is the success criteria, acceptance criteria, what are the different H cases, dependencies. So product manager
4:59:32
will closely work with the engineering team in order to develop a detailed specifications. However, for step number
4:59:38
one, two and three specifically uh for voice of customers and creating a summary, product manager will work
4:59:44
closely with um you know marketing team, BA team and all those guys. Um but uh
4:59:50
defining user story, creating uh features and top level feature
4:59:55
requirements, it is expected that product manager will do these things. So for step number one product manager will
5:00:03
closely work with the marketing business analyst BD accounts team. Step number
5:00:09
two again product manager will get help from these guys same guys who have mentioned as a part of stakeholders for
5:00:15
step number one but uh step number three product manager is responsible identify
5:00:21
core problem define the user story creating a top level feature requirements I would say product manager
5:00:26
will do it and once top level requirements are developed product manager will work closely with
5:00:32
engineering team in order to identify low-level requirements it is also called as a detailed specifications
5:00:38
wherein what is the functionality UI related details performance related details acceptance criteria H case
5:00:44
dependencies all those things are in detail captured so this is called as a
5:00:51
engineering specifications detail specifications so this is the journey of a feature is
5:00:59
it clear designing product features and specifications this is important core roles and responsibilities of a product
5:01:05
manager this is where uh this is how putting the features prioritization vision and then actual development
5:01:11
starts. Just try to understand you know how critical these steps are there you know if you if you decided that okay I
5:01:17
want only two customizable options and uh because of some user feedback and
5:01:24
once you launch the product and you'll see a kind of a negative comment that customizable options are only two I want
5:01:30
it to be further customized for hourly basis so that's where uh you have to
5:01:37
check what kind of quality of your customer survey so everything boils down to step number one. What is the quality
5:01:43
of uh voice of customer data you collected? So this is the foundation I would say for products. Try to
5:01:50
understand the customer pulse. If this is not going well then rest of the
5:01:55
things are uh dependent upon step number one. Next point is evaluating product features for customer fit. Yeah, it's a
5:02:03
small thing I think not a big deal. It talks about okay how best you are fitting the customer requirement once
5:02:09
you launch the product. So analyze the how how success of your product checking
Evaluating Product Features for Customer Fit
5:02:15
you know the features what you have selected are they meeting the customer needs or not. So analyze uh how do you
5:02:22
do it analyze usage data and matrices. So post launch analyze product usage data to evaluate how well these features
5:02:28
are meeting the customer needs. You have the KPIs you know monitor metrices like a user how many what kind of user
5:02:35
engagement ratings are there? how many people feature what is the feature adoption rate customer satisfaction
5:02:42
course. So by looking at those KPIs you can able to check uh whether whatever features you have shortlisted
5:02:49
prioritized are meeting the customer requirement or not and does it define customer fit. For example analyze the
5:02:55
percentage of user utilizing the task reminder feature versus those who signed up for the tool. So it might happen that
5:03:01
you know you have multiple people who have signed up for the tool. they have downloaded your application uh but
5:03:08
nobody's using your feature task reminder feature. So try to check from Google Analytics, prov analytics from
5:03:15
product analytics about those KPIs and it will define whether it is customer fit or not fit. Customer support
5:03:22
feedback review customer support tickets and feedback to identify recurring issues requested related to specific
5:03:28
features. It may if many users report confusion about using task assignment
5:03:34
features. It may indicate that they need additional onboarding adjustment. I'll give you one example very interesting
5:03:40
example. I it was the case of during 2016
5:03:47
Tata Motors has launched a vehicle you might have known Tata Arya A R AI. At
5:03:53
that time Cyrus mystery was the chairman of Tata Group and it was basically his baby Tata area.
5:04:00
They have used all hyphen features you know one of the feature was uh which was
5:04:06
not at all available in India for most of the companies. One of the feature was uh rain detection sensor. So ideally you
5:04:14
know if it is raining you will manually trigger the wipers. So in 2016 Tata
5:04:20
Motors has launched this feature wherein automatically it will detect the rain detection uh rain by using the rain
5:04:25
detection sensor and automatically it will trigger the wipers. uh but it was not properly communicated to the end
5:04:31
customer and when vehicle was launched we we get lot of complaints that wiper is misfunctioning even if I don't give a
5:04:39
command still it is automatically triggering so that basically talks about uh
5:04:46
customers were not expecting this features either one second one is uh okay we find that there is value for
5:04:52
this uh feature accordingly we developed it we implemented it but we failed to communicate the information to customer
5:04:58
it could be a issue from sales team but this was overall failure for that feature. So that was one of the case
5:05:04
wherein uh we look at whether the customer product feature and customer
5:05:09
fit. So that's where it talks about the feature and customer fit whether they go hand in hand or not. So that is one way
5:05:15
of capturing the checking whether customer feed is there or not and then
5:05:20
you capture this information iterate and improve based on feedback based on customer feedback and usage data iterate
5:05:27
on the feature to enhance the customer fit identify areas of improvement analyze the feedback to determine where
5:05:34
features may fall short or what improvements can be made. Example, if uh
5:05:39
user finds a task uh assignment feature is too complex, consider, you
5:05:44
know, making it more simplify the GUI, add kind of uh tool tips, notifications,
5:05:51
some kind of a demo, training, guidance, implement those changes, make necessary adjustment to the features based on user
5:05:57
insights. Ensure that your satisfaction will improve. Again, this is very continuous process, continuous feedback
5:06:03
loop. Finally, establish a continuous feedback loop in order to ensure that ongoing alignments with customer needs
5:06:09
regularly have a check-in. Conduct a regular check-in with customers. Gather the feedback not only customer basically
5:06:15
you can get those um customer feedback reports from Google Analytics or from some other platform and uh accordingly
5:06:21
you have to develop and read it. Conclusion is uh evaluating product feature for customer fit involves a
5:06:27
structured approach that begins with understanding customer personas needs mapping the features to those needs.
5:06:34
Features versus customer needs. You have to have that matrix and validating the features through feedback and data analysis by continuously iterating and
5:06:41
engaging with customer. Product managers can ensure that their product remains aligned with customer expectations and
5:06:47
it will remain competitive and relevant into the market. But again further details about uh what are those KPIs how
5:06:54
to generate a customer feedback report we are going to study in product analytics module. But overall as a
5:07:01
product manager once product is launched how to check whether we are in line or not. Look for customer feedback. You'll
5:07:08
get insights and accordingly you can check whether whatever you have developed and launched is does it follow
5:07:13
as per the customer expectation or not. There's a small one pager on this topic. Customer evaluating product feature and
5:07:19
customer fit. Just a quick info guys, Intellipath offers product management course training. Through this course, you will

5:07:56
the first step towards career growth in the field of product management. Again, uh there are a couple of small
5:08:02
small concepts we'll try to understand. First one is product mix and product lines. uh very important for a product
5:08:08
manager you know at least for his organization and for his competitor you know close competitor organization he
5:08:14
should have good understanding about uh what is the product mix. So what is product mix? So product mix basically
5:08:20
definition talks about it refers to complete range of products that company offers to its customer. It represents
5:08:26
total variety of uh products that business sells and it can be classified in terms of uh you know width of a
5:08:33
product mix, length of a product mix, depth of a product mix and the consist consistency in the product mix. So
5:08:38
product mix overall products what you are selling to the end customer and this product mix can be categorized or can be
5:08:45
represented by width, length, depth and overall consistency. So let's try to understand what what does each mean. So
5:08:52
width refers to number of different product lines a company offers. Wider
5:08:57
the product mix it means that company has multiple product lines. So just to give an example just if you take an in a
5:09:04
case of Apple as an organization and if you take uh what kind of product lines they have. So there is one product line
5:09:10
for iPhones. There is another product line for MacBook. There is another product line for iPad and I think
5:09:17
recently they started another product line for variables. So these are called as a this is called as a width number of
5:09:25
different product lines. So for Apple in this case we have the width number is four because they have four product
5:09:32
lines. These are independent product lines. So this is about width. Second concept length of a product line. So
5:09:39
basically refers to the total number of products or items within a within you know one particular product line. So
5:09:45
length for iPhone, length for MacBook, length for iPad, length for variables. That's it. That's how it is. So if you
5:09:52
take an example of uh iPhone as in product line, the company has multiple models within iPhone. You know, you have
5:09:59
iPhone SE, 14, 14 Pro, 15, 15 Pro. So how many products are there within that
5:10:05
product line is basically it talks about overall it represents the length of a product line. And the last which is
5:10:12
depth. Depth refers to number of variants each product uh of each product
5:10:17
in that product line. For example, you know, you can have iPhone 14 in 64GB,
5:10:23
you can have it in 128GB, you can have it in 256GB, you can have it in different different
5:10:29
colors, sizes, models. So, depth refers to number of variations of each product
5:10:35
in a product line. Different size, colors, models. I each iPhone model has
5:10:40
different storage options you know 64 128 256 as we discussed plus uh there
5:10:45
will be there could be a variation in the color so that's what it represent the depth and at the end basically
5:10:52
consistency so consistency refers to how closely related the various product
5:10:58
lines are in terms of production distribution and usage for example Apple's product iPhone iPad MacBook are
5:11:05
highly consistent because they all operate in similar software you know they they all are on iOS as operating
5:11:12
system and are designed for similar customer base. So how much what is the level of commonization they have? How
5:11:20
much consistency is there? So how how what is the commonality they have that represents the consistency?
5:11:26
So product mix width number of product lines length number of products in the
5:11:32
product line depth number of variants for each product in a product line
5:11:39
consistency what's the commonality between different different products within that product mix so let's take
5:11:46
another case of Nike so width Nike has a multiple product lines you know they have footwear as a product line they
5:11:53
have apparel and equipment length within footwear you know they offer um sneakers, running shoes,
5:12:02
basketball shoes, walking shoes, soccer shoes. So that's the length depth. Nike
5:12:08
offers various colors and sizes for each sneakers model such as Air Max in
5:12:13
different styles and colors. So within sneakers they have different different variety. It could be design, it could be
5:12:19
color, consistency. All products are related to sports and active lifestyle.
5:12:24
Maintaining consistency across product line because they basically mostly Nike is not for um sports related uh area. So
5:12:32
that's the commonality that's the consistency as per your understanding this width number, length number, depth
5:12:38
number ideally it should be high or it should be low. And if no questions are there typically what should be the value
5:12:45
for width, length and depth should be high or it should be low. Length and width good to be high and depth good to
5:12:52
be low. Okay, you should not overdesign the product. You know it should not last for 10 years, 15 years. You should look
5:12:58
at what is the customer expectation. If customer expectation is 2 to three years, that's how you know you should
5:13:03
design your product. If you are designing it for five to 10 year five, designing a product which will last for more than 5 years that means there is a
5:13:10
lot of uh opportunity for cost reduction for your product product which you have
5:13:16
not done it and uh I I personally feel you know if that's the situation shoes
5:13:21
nobody would like to use the shoes which is five years old because design is very very old and but still they are in a
5:13:27
good shape and condition looks like it is these are old design you know at that time they could have done some cost optimization they could So reduce the
5:13:34
cost they could have kept the price constant and they could have basically increased the overall margin for the
5:13:40
company. Point number one. So that is the first opportunity they have lost and first and second one is in 3 years 3 to
5:13:46
four years to go back and they have to buy another shoe. I think that was also opportunity lost for Nike. Even if it
5:13:53
lost for three years still it will give good u review because that's the expectation for a retail buyer.
5:13:58
Okay. Whether it these are like a retail consumer products or they are electronic products or what kind of products are
5:14:04
they plus you know when it comes to width defining how many product lines your company should have. It's solely
5:14:11
depends upon what kind of brand value you have. For example, if you are a new guy into the in that industry, you do
5:14:18
not want to have multiple product lines because you are here you are somebody like um newcomer into the industry. You
5:14:25
would like to have a limited product lines. you would like to focus on so that you can have a better focus on those product lines, those products and
5:14:31
you would like to create impression, create a identity for yourself in that industry. So width is totally depends
5:14:38
upon you know what kind of maturity you have in that industry. If you are new or if you are fairly new, I typically width
5:14:46
number is very very low and if the organization is very well established, you can see the width number is very
5:14:51
very high. talking about length and depth it totally depends upon you know uh the industry the product and the end
5:14:58
customer so that's how basically length and depth defined but I I can give one
5:15:03
more example uh let's take example of uh Tata Motors when I joined the Tata motor
5:15:09
Tata motors basically yeah it was very much established organization and I'm talking about product basically the
5:15:15
engine variations don't take it as overall vehicle variations engine variations so within petrol how many variants they have so since it was very
5:15:22
much established uh company. So product lines they they were multiple types of
5:15:27
uh you know petrol var petrol products petrol engines were there but when it comes to length you know they had so
5:15:33
many variants. So because of which the inventory management operation management it was very very difficult
5:15:39
because they had to maintain 75 variants of engines and it has created a huge
5:15:45
inventory cost operation management cost. Most of the variants does not have you know good sales still they were you
5:15:51
know keeping them active. So they have to ensure that the spare parts are available across all customer supports
5:15:57
and all. So if you have the the length and depth numbers are very very high it
5:16:03
it becomes very very difficult for customer service perspective. So periodically each organization they will
5:16:11
do the review for what kind of uh length is there, what kind of depth is there and annually they will check it and if
5:16:18
the kind of one particular variant does not have a good demand typically they go they they go you know they go to again
5:16:25
that product life cycle management and they will take a decision to kill that particular variant either it in length
5:16:30
or it in depth. So that's how they will do it because having a too many variants in length and depth will create a big
5:16:37
problem for operations management but width is totally depends upon uh you know what kind of maturity you have in
5:16:43
that industry. So that that's my perspective. Okay, good. Let's go to next slide then.
5:16:50
Okay, VBO says uh how it works for SAS software as a sales product. Again, it
5:16:57
the concept will remain same. You know how many variants of SAS products are there with you? Let me I think how many
5:17:05
variants of SAS products are there? I know what kind of uh so length in in
5:17:10
that case you know you have a single software and you are selling it as a service. However, you know, but it it can have different uh pricing models,
5:17:17
you know, one it could be using uh paper uh sorry paper price one you can one for
5:17:23
one you can have um kind of bundle pricing model. So concept remains same
5:17:28
whether it is a product based company or service based company. So overall it talks about what kind of variations are
5:17:34
there which you are providing from yourself to the target market and all
5:17:39
those variants which you have to manage are optimal or not. If they are not optimal, please check it and you can
5:17:46
retire couple of variants. So that's the concept. It is applicable to uh service industry as well. VBO. Let's go to
5:17:52
product line. Uh let's try to go one level deeper. Product line. So product line as we understood refers to group of
5:17:58
related products that are marketed under single brand. So key word here is single brand and are designed to serve specific
5:18:05
segment or meet a particular need. All products within the product line typically have similar functionality and
5:18:11
are marketed to the same customer base share distribution channel. So for
5:18:17
example uh if you go for product uh line it could be Apple iPhone as a category
5:18:24
iPhone basically they have a single brand Apple iPhone they are designed to
5:18:30
serve specific segment. So you have you know target customer for Apple mobiles.
5:18:37
So customer segment remains same for all the products within the product line and they basically they meet a particular
5:18:43
need. Yes. Basically brand communication device branded communication device that's the need. All products within the
5:18:51
product line typically have similar functionality. So Apple 13 to 14 to 15
5:18:56
most of the features will remain same. 15 might have some additional 10% feature. than 14. 14 might have 10 to
5:19:02
20% feature additional but more or less you will see 80%age features are same
5:19:08
and marketed to the same customer base. Yes, customer base are same and share same distribution channels. So
5:19:13
distribution, inventory and all those things will remain same. So that's the definition of product line. Keywords for
5:19:18
product line definition are they have a single brand. They serve a specific segment and they have similar
5:19:26
functionality marketed to the same customer base and share same distribution channels. Key
5:19:32
characteristics of a product line. So as we discussed uh the related products products in product line typically share
5:19:38
similar features or are designed for same purpose. For example, Coca-Cola
5:19:43
offers product line of a beverage that includes Coke, Diet Coke, Coke Zero,
5:19:48
flavored Coke related products targeting the same customer. Product in the product line often uh often aimed at the
5:19:55
same or similar customer segments. For example, if you take Microsoft Office, so product line includes um Word, Excel,
5:20:02
PowerPoint and now if you go for the latest generation product which is copilot all are designed for business purpose corporate users. Next one is
5:20:09
sold under common brand name. Products within the product line are usually marked under you know under consistent
5:20:16
brand identity. Example L'Oreal has a skincare products that includes a moisturizer, cleaners, sunscreen but uh
5:20:24
if you look at what brand so everybody you know shares the same brand which is
5:20:29
L'Oreal. Examples of product line Tesla for example product line Tesla's electric vehicle constitutes uh
5:20:34
constitute a product line. So product in the line they have model S, model 3, X, Y all are focusing on sustainable
5:20:41
energy, premium automotive design, electric vehicle and shared features. Each model shared similar features such
5:20:46
as electric powertrain, autonomous driving, focus on sustainability, so and so forth. This is you know details about
5:20:53
product line. I hope you guys are clear with the product line definition and uh product mix plus product line. So let's
5:21:01
a top level differentiation. So product mix is the entire collection of a product. Uh product line is specific
5:21:06
group of related products under one brand. A scope uh you know it includes all the product lines and their
5:21:12
variations. So product mix means anything and everything in your for your whatever your organization sells. But product line is no basically it includes
5:21:19
only one category of products. Uh width I think uh same question what George was
5:21:24
asking. uh it represents how many product lines are there in the company and product line it represent number of
5:21:30
related products in this specific category. So number of product lines defines the width and product line is
5:21:36
basically u within that product line number of related products. The focus
5:21:42
for product mix entire company's product offering and product line focus is
5:21:47
focuses on the products that have similar customer needs. Example we discussed Nike's product mix includes
5:21:53
footwear apparel equipment. Nike's product line running shoes. So one of them is here which is running shoes
5:21:59
includes multiple models zoom regresses. Now the question is why product mix and
5:22:05
product lines are important for business market coverage. A diverse mix allows companies to target different customer
5:22:11
segments and expand their market presence. you know overall market coverage risk management by having
5:22:17
multiple product lines companies can reduce the dependency on one product and
5:22:23
spirit risk you know if one product fails you have multiple products so
5:22:29
basically having multiple products uh it will reduce the risk brand extension companies can leverage their brand's
5:22:35
reputation across product lines to launch new products this is what business will get by having multiple
5:22:41
products or you know in general having product mix for customers, you know, you should you will have I think a brand mix
5:22:48
gives the customer more choices across different categories. You know, I have multiple variants. Uh specialization
5:22:54
product line offer specialized product that cater specific needs or preferences making it easier for customers to find
5:23:01
the right product. In fact, you know, let's take example of Samsung phone. You
5:23:06
know, they have category like uh I don't know how many you how many of you follow the Samsung phones. There is a series
5:23:13
which is specifically available in um Samsung stores. They have again I think
5:23:19
uh M series specifically available in I think Amazon. They have F series
5:23:26
specifically available on uh Flipkart. But product specification if you see 95%age product specifications are same.
5:23:34
But if you see the product pricing there is uh A is always costlier than M and M
5:23:39
and F are similar. So if you closely look at Samsung portfolio, you will see
5:23:44
there is a lot of overlap. There is a small differences but for that small differences also they created a separate
5:23:50
uh you know series and accordingly they are positioning it. So if I want to buy
5:23:57
from uh Samsung stores I need to go for a similar product I can get it from Amazon
5:24:03
also. I can get it in much more cheaper rate. uh but it is online and you know
5:24:09
when you ask uh Samsung retail guy customer service okay what's the difference between A and M then they say
5:24:14
that uh uh A is little bit better in performance but not much uh better you
5:24:20
know but still they ask for plus almost 3 to 4,000 premium for A series rather
5:24:26
than M series so for customer you know if you are looking for more reliable you will go for A series if you are okay
5:24:33
with uh little bit compromise on performance you'll go for M series. So that's what you know for customer having
5:24:39
a different product lines, different product variants will give you a
5:24:44
different choices and accordingly they are targeting your end customer. I think here we have example of PNG, Proctor and
5:24:51
Gamber offers wide mix wide mix product mix including beauty, healthcare,
5:24:56
cleaning products. Each product lines for example tight laundry detergent head and shoulder shampoos serves distinct uh
5:25:03
customer needs but collectively broadens PNG market reach. So they have
5:25:09
multiple products PNG similar example is HL they have multiple product lines and
5:25:14
within that product lines they they compete with each other basically PNG versus HL. So that's that's basically
5:25:20
defines why why you have to have a product mix and product lines different different product lines because from
5:25:26
business side you can able to manage the risk you can able to select um separate
5:25:31
target customer and from customer side you you you will get a right product for your requirement that's why it is
5:25:38
important. So as a concept okay we have understood but what is in it what uh
5:25:44
what is what it meant for product managers. So once you are a product manager, you should know what is the
5:25:50
product mix for your product. What is you know your product falls under which
5:25:56
product line. You should have a very good understanding about uh what is the width for your organization? What is the
5:26:03
length for your organization? What is the depth for your organization? Which product you are managing and you
5:26:09
should have similar similar information for your competitor as well. So which is your core competitor which are your
5:26:15
adjacent competitors. So that's where you are going to use this concepts the organization you know your you can take
5:26:22
your organization as an example and uh a broad example about what kind of uh
5:26:28
product lines they have and you can take any one product line how many variants
5:26:33
are there and what is the depth anybody would like to explain worth trying don't
5:26:38
worry you can talk let's go to the next concept now let's try to understand uh
5:26:45
number which is product line extension and modification. A subconcept of product
5:26:51
mix and product lines. What is the meaning of product line extension? So product line extension refers to
5:26:56
addition of a new product to existing product line. Uh the new products are typically variants of the existing one
5:27:04
but offer different features like a style or different uh you know target market. This strategy is used to
5:27:10
leverage brand equity and customer loyalty to expand expand the company's presence into the market without the
5:27:17
need for launching entirely new product. So basically extension means you have set of products iPhone 13 14 15 is there
5:27:24
and now you would like to extend it by iPhone 16. So everything is available you are creating additional product
5:27:31
line. So types of product line extension new variants offering a product in
Product Line Extension and Modification
5:27:37
different flavors, color, size, design, a new feature. You can think of adding or enhancing features to differentiate
5:27:43
the product from existing ones or targeting new segment and introducing product that caters to new customer
5:27:49
segments or demography. A premium versus budget version all those things. So it
5:27:54
is called as a product line extension. Examples Coca-Cola existing uh extending
5:28:01
its product line by offering variants like a Diet Coke, Coke Zero, uh Coke Cherry. These variants target customers
5:28:08
who wants low calories option or different flavors while maintaining the core identity of Coca-Cola. So existing
5:28:14
will everything will remain same. You are trying to sell the product with Coca-Cola brand but you are creating a
5:28:21
specific variant to target specific customers. So in this case diet cod if you take an example they were targeting
5:28:27
those customers who are worried about calorie intake. So they created a diet cook and they created a new segment and
5:28:34
accordingly they captured that market. If you take example of Apple's iPhone line Apple often extends its uh iPhone
5:28:41
line with new models such as you know iPhone 13 14 which differ in terms of feature price points performance levels
5:28:48
but cater different customer needs within the same product line. So product line extension addition of product into
5:28:54
your product line to c a specific need for a customer and to extend your uh end
5:29:00
customers. This is called as a product line extension. Let's try to understand product modification. So there is lot of
5:29:06
overlap but again modification terminology is basically referring to the changes. Typically they do it for
5:29:11
mostly for improvements made for existing products in the product line. These modifications can be driven by you
5:29:16
know could be technological advancement, customer feedback, market competition, regulatory requirement. Product
5:29:22
modifications are aimed at keeping the product relevant, improving the performance or aligning with market
5:29:28
trends without launching entirely new product. So here also you do modifications on your product but the
5:29:34
intention is not to target for new customer. Here you are targeting existing customer but you are trying to
5:29:40
give them the enhanced service. It could be software bug fix or it could be uh
5:29:46
improved performance like that. So modifications due to customer complaint. Yeah, correct. Modifications due to in
5:29:53
customer complaints. Uh it could be improving the product's durability, performance, reliability. A car manufacturer upgrading engine or safety
5:30:00
features of existing models to improve its performance. Functional modification enhancing an additional new
5:30:06
functionality to product to improve its us usefulness or convenience. a smartphone manufacturer adding new
5:30:12
camera feature increasing battery life. This basically kind of overlaps a lot
5:30:18
with product line extension. If you see functional modifications wherein uh the existing functions are kind of less you
5:30:25
thought of adding new features, new functions and so you added that as an
5:30:31
new variant in your product line, new product in your product line. So that also can fall under product line
5:30:37
extension category. But the first one quality modifications wherein you don't want to continue the product you know
5:30:43
production of older product B and basically you are stopping the production of older product and you are
5:30:48
enhancing the performance and then accordingly you are positioning it. So that that falls under product
5:30:53
modification category. It could be style or aesthetic modification, changing the appearance, design, packaging, uh
5:30:59
feature upgradation. Again, it falls under feature functional modification category. But essentially, modification
5:31:04
talks for uh if there are issues, you enhance it. You stop the previous version, then you modify it. An
5:31:11
extension means okay, you don't stop the current variant, you will add another category into the product line and but
5:31:18
the production for both the variants will happen parallelly. That's how it is. So, is this clear? Product line
5:31:24
extension modification. Extension means adding a new product uh in your product line. Modification is uh modifying it
5:31:31
because of customer complaint or some quality issues. Why? What are the benefits? Product line extensions. What benefits you are going to get? As we
5:31:37
discussed, you know, market segmentation allowing companies to target u different customer group or niche market with
5:31:44
variations that meet the specific needs or preferences. So, you're creating a new market segmentation. Brand loyalty.
5:31:51
Customer who are loyal to your brand are more likely to try to new products within the same line reducing marketing
5:31:57
cost. So you know extension you don't have to do extra you know marketing campaigning because most of the time
5:32:03
existing customers will go for new product what you are launching in product line extension. So you have you
5:32:08
are leveraging your existing brand brand value and you are leveraging existing brand brand loyalty increased market
5:32:16
share. By doing all those things you are at the end of the day you are increasing your market share and you are increasing your competitive advantage because uh
5:32:23
extension allow companies to stay competitive by introducing new options and staying relevant into the market.
5:32:29
Additional thing what has not been written here is you know risk mitigation. So if you see think that uh
5:32:36
there is a lot of competition for your existing product, you have created new product variant to target for a
5:32:42
particular niche uh customer segment and accordingly you are reducing the dependency for your current generation
5:32:47
of product because there is a lot of competition even though over a period of time your current generation product doesn't do well since you you have
5:32:54
created a new variant targeted for uh certain segment of a customer for which you have very less computation because
5:33:00
of doing all those things you are reducing the risk. product modifications. Yeah, I think as we
5:33:05
discussed, Amul also mentioned uh that about uh customer satisfaction. You know, you have too many complaints, you
5:33:11
modify your existing product. Modifying the product based on customer feedback helps address pain points, enhance
5:33:16
customer user experience. Uh stay current, you know, modification keep your products up to date with industry
5:33:21
standards, technological advancement and at the end you are going to get customer
5:33:27
basically good customer feedback. Cost effective innovation modifications allows companies to refresh existing
5:33:32
product without the cost and risk launching entirely new product products. So cost effective innovations without
5:33:38
cost and risk of launching entirely new products. So it's very very cost effective and compliance and safety. In
5:33:45
some cases product modifications are necessary to meet the new safety regulations environmental standards. So accordingly you create a product
5:33:51
modification and modified product you would like to launch it to a new market. Examples of product line extension and modifications. So let's let's go back to
5:33:58
Toyota hybrid line extension. Toyota extended its product line from with Prius. They expand then expanded it to
5:34:05
further variants like uh Prius C compact, Prius V, larger wagon, Prius
5:34:11
Prime, plug-in hybrid. This allowed Toyota, Toyota to target different customer needs with a eco-friendly
5:34:17
vehicle segment. So like that they created extension for CV and prime which are targeted for compact customer, large
5:34:24
wagon customer and plug-in hybrid customer. product line modification. Apple camera modification could be the
5:34:29
good example. With each iteration of the iPhone, Apple modifies modifies the
5:34:35
camera system improving the you know they go for higher resolution. They go for you know additional features like a
5:34:41
night mode enhancing image stabilization. This modification keep iPhone competitive in the smartphone
5:34:47
industry smartphone market while appealing to the customer who prioritize photography. So that's the example of uh
5:34:54
modification. modification extension I think straightforward concept yeah okay
5:34:59
let's go to next slide strategic decisions on product line so for example let's take a case wherein you are the
5:35:05
product line product manager so you are handling whole product man product line and you are product manager for that
5:35:12
line so just to go back to Moj's question you know let's take example
5:35:18
product line the products what you are managing are fairly complex so typically typical designation for product line
5:35:25
product manager is a director level. So you are director of product manager. You handle a big product line and uh what
5:35:31
are the decisions you need to make at that level on that product line. So that's what we will try to understand in
5:35:37
number six. Okay. So the first decision is product line length decision. So this
5:35:43
involves determining how many individual products or SKS should be included in the product line. A product line can be
5:35:51
extended or shortened depends upon company's goal and market condition. So you will decide how many products are
Strategic Decisions on Product Line
5:35:58
there in your product line. Do you need to modify? Do do you need to extend them? Do you need to reduce them? If at
5:36:05
all you want to add a new product. So it is called as line stretching. Okay.
5:36:13
New concept. So companies can stretch the line in three ways. For example, the
5:36:19
first way is called as a upward stretch. So, introducing higherend premium product to cater more uh affluent
5:36:26
customer base. Uh you are going to introduce a premium product into the existing product line. It is called as
5:36:31
upward stretch. So, Toyota stretching its product line upward with the introduction of luxury brand like Lexus.
5:36:39
So, Lexus was kind of a upward stretch for the product line. They created a
5:36:44
overall new product line for Alexus which catered to premium products. So it was like upward stretch of line. Second
5:36:51
one is downward stretch of line wherein you are introducing a lower price product to attract more budget uh
5:36:57
conscious customers. Samsung offering budget mobiles like Galaxy A series in
5:37:03
addition to its premium Galaxy S series. So A series is premium, A series is budget customers. So you are basically
5:37:10
stretching the product line downward and two-way you are expanding it in both way. So Marriott hotel if you take an
5:37:17
example they offer budget friendly option uh fairfield in as well as luxury
5:37:23
options calton to capture both ends of market.
5:37:29
Okay. So you can expand the existing product line upward, you can expand the product line downward, you can expand
5:37:36
your product line both the ways or you can do line filling. So this involves uh
5:37:41
adding more products within the existing range of the product line to fill the gaps or satisfy specific customer needs
5:37:49
that are not yet addressed. For example, Coca-Cola adding a different flavor of diet coat, diet coke lime, diet cloak
5:37:57
cherry to fill the gaps in customer preferences for flavored uh low calorie
5:38:02
drinks. So it is called as line filling. So you can have line goes upward, you
5:38:08
can have line goes downward, you can have line goes both upward and downward or you can have you know same line but
5:38:15
you are going to fill in the gaps which earlier the product was not available. So I think example they have given is
5:38:22
coa Coca-Cola. So diet coke was available but you know they thought that okay let's uh make some more variants
5:38:30
let's increase the depth. So let's go for diet coke l climb diet coke cherry and accordingly they created a separate
5:38:36
product. In fact I can give one more example of automotive industry. So uh
5:38:41
before 2020 you had uh hatchback you know like uh Hundai I it swift or you
5:38:49
have sedan uh like uh swift desire or you had Tatamanza
5:38:56
these kind of vehicles and after that you had utility vehicle which were uh like uh Tatasumos Grande and all these
5:39:03
Mahindra's product portfolio. However Tata came up with a new segment called as a CUV. It is called as a compact
5:39:10
utility vehicle. So if you look at uh Tatan Nexon, it is the I think it was
5:39:16
the first CUV vehicle, compact utility vehicle which was uh again I think uh uh
5:39:23
similar products where Ford uh Ford had one vehicle in that category.
5:39:29
So essentially what I would like to tell you that they do it across multiple industries. So they look for you know is
5:39:35
your products are captured uh is there any room for filling the gap in
5:39:43
your existing product portfolio. If yes it is called as a line filling.
5:39:49
We have one comment called from George Indica is the Indica is the first one in hback but I was talking about CUV
5:39:55
category compact utility vehicle. So Tata next one that was first vehicle in that category because earlier we had uh
5:40:03
overall utility vehicle but you never had CUV kind of category. So CUV uh next
5:40:10
one was the first vehicle. So it was like a line filling. You bring one product in between this uh two product
5:40:17
two products it is called as line filling. And you know why this terminologies it looks very simple but
5:40:24
uh they expect you to use these terminologies. These are key terms they use it in product management world. So
5:40:30
when you talk to another product manager, when you talk to your product line head, you're supposed to use this terminology. Sir, can we think of upward
5:40:36
stretch? Sir, can we think of downward stretch? So these these words are expected because these are commonly used
5:40:43
verbage in product management uh day-to-day activity. So that's where these words are important. Line filling.
5:40:50
So it is basically a product line manager you know who is responsible for
5:40:56
whole product line. It is his responsibility to look for what are the different products are there in that product line. Is there any possibility?
5:41:03
Is there any you know market to upward stretch that product line? Is there any you know opportunities to downward
5:41:09
stretch it? Do I need to two-way stretch it or do I need to go for line filling?
5:41:14
So overall responsibility is product line manager. And as I told uh typical
5:41:20
this lies with uh director of product management uh is a typical designation for product line manager. So he works
5:41:27
closely with uh marketing team. He will check uh what kind of customer demands are there, how many demands we are
5:41:33
meeting, how many demands we are not meeting and he will also have a close eye on what competitors does and
5:41:39
accordingly he will decide whether you need to create a new segment in your product line or you are happy with your existing segments. Next point is product
5:41:47
line differentiation. So you are the product line owner. You have to differentiating product within the
5:41:54
product line helps ensure that each products appeals to distinguish uh segment sorry appeals to distinct
5:42:02
segment of the market or address different needs without causing customer confusion. So you as a product manager
5:42:08
you have to ensure that each product in your product line has its own um space
5:42:14
and there is no kind of overlap you know what we understood I think just before some time you are not cannibalizing the
5:42:21
product within the product line it's product lines man product line product manager's responsibility to ensure that
5:42:28
you have separate products which are catering to a different customer base or different customer demands and no
5:42:34
products are cannibalizing others strategic consideration targeting different customer segments. So
5:42:40
differentiating products by features, quality, price to cater to various customer segments. Example, Apple
5:42:46
differentiates its uh MacBook line by MacBook Air targeting general users and
5:42:52
MacBook Pro targeting professionals and power users. So if you are a product line manager for MacBook, you have two
5:42:58
products MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. So here you have to ensure that uh each product caters to different uh end
5:43:05
customers. So air is targeting for general users, pro is targeting for power users. Innovative features
5:43:12
introducing new features or technologies to differentiate the products. So you have to ensure that as a product line manager each product has innovative
5:43:18
features which can differentiate itself not only among that products which are in the product line but also with
5:43:25
competitor products also. Example, Samsung different Samsung differentiates it Galaxy smartphone by offering
5:43:32
foldable phones. So Galaxy Z Fold, Z Flip alongside standard models. So I
5:43:38
think flip is the flip feature is a differentiating feature. So that's how they are positioning it. Brand
5:43:45
positioning using product differentiation to reinforce the brand positioning. Premium versus mass market.
5:43:52
Uh Rolex differentiates its luxury watches with unique design, exclusive
5:43:57
material and high craftsmanship reinforcing its premium positioning. So
5:44:02
brand positioning. So typically these are the ways by you by doing that one you ensure that there is a product line
5:44:08
as a differentiation product line differentiation product line stretching decisions. So as a product line product
5:44:15
manager you will do these two decisions. Okay let's go to next page. Product line extension decisions. It is like overlap
5:44:22
of this one number one. So they call it as the companies often face strategic uh
5:44:27
decisions regarding extending the product lines to enter new market or address and mute needs. Horizontal
5:44:32
product line extension introducing new product at the same price point to cater to different taste styles or or
5:44:38
preferences without significantly altering the core product. So L'Oreal extending its skin care line with
5:44:44
products that cater to different skin types. You know you can have one product for sensitive, one product for oily. In
5:44:50
fact they launched fair and lovely for oily skin. Similarly L'Oreal also has the same
5:44:58
product which are targeting for different skin types accordingly. You can have horizontal product line
5:45:03
extension or you can have vertical product line extension introducing new product at different price point either
5:45:09
more affordable which is downward what we have understood in the last slide or upward which is more premium to target
5:45:16
to different income groups. So vertical product line extension you know upward downward what we understood horizontal
5:45:22
is more interesting here. So you have same price but you can have different u
5:45:28
customizable option I would say. So that's how you can position your products. Cannibalization risk. I think
5:45:33
that's what we understood when existing product line. A key strategic decision involves managing the risk of
5:45:39
cannibalization where the new products made takes sales away from existing product
5:45:45
uh instead of attracting new customers. When Apple introduced iPhone SE as a more affordable option, it risk
5:45:52
cannibalized sales from more expensive iPhone models. So cannibalization risk is there. So this risk are typically you
5:46:00
are trying to do the cannibalization risk at product line product management level. So it is his responsibility to
5:46:06
ensure that uh it is not cannibalized. Yeah. Fourth one is product line modernization. So product line needs
5:46:13
continuous updating and improvements to say to stay relevant to stay competitive into the market and keep the pace with
5:46:20
the technological advancement changing consumer preference and regulatory changes. Now what are the key decisions?
5:46:27
Upgrading existing products, modernizing the products, it could be material design
5:46:32
to keep them relevant. You know Tesla regularly upgrades its electric vehicle softwares and um add new autonomous
5:46:39
driving features to keep product line modern and cutting edge. In fact, not only Tesla, each company they you know
5:46:46
yearly they they go for model year. So 2020 16 model 2017 model and 16 model
5:46:53
will be phased out when they start production of 2017 and they 17 will be advanced version of 16. So they keep on
5:47:00
upgrading the existing products so that uh you are addressing the customer complaints for existing models and also
5:47:06
you are keeping relevant you are keeping those products relevant in the market by going for the latest trends and latest
5:47:13
technologies. uh phasing of the old model that's what I told as a product line modernization companies must
5:47:18
strategically decide when to phase out outdated products Microsoft disting discontinued support for older variants
5:47:25
for Windows to focus on new versions like 10 and 11 so if you look at uh Microsoft no more provides the support
5:47:31
for 7 Microsoft 7 applications now because they already moved to 10 and 11
5:47:37
in fact they are looking for stopping the support for Windows 10 also they're totally focusing on 11 and above
5:47:43
investing In sustainability, many companies are modernizing the product lines by incorporating more sustainable
5:47:48
features. You know, uh designs, materials and production process.
5:47:54
Uh Pentagonia incorporates sustainable materials in clothing lines and continuously upgrades products to reduce
5:48:00
environmental impact. But I think they do a lot of it could be sustainability reason. It could be a customer
5:48:05
compliance reason. It could be making the product more uh uh you know
5:48:10
efficient or more relevant to the new newest technologies go for software
5:48:16
bugs. So these are the different uh I would say trigger points to keep your product line modernization. So typically
5:48:23
once in a six months every product line manager they will have thorough review on all the products. I would say
5:48:30
quarterly you know wherein they will check what kind of how many customer complaints are you are getting on that product. Uh do you have opportunities
5:48:38
for improvement performance? Do you have cost reduction opportunities? I think the last point every organization is
5:48:44
working on sustainability. So every product manager will have sustainability goals in his annual operating you know
5:48:50
goal settings. every year goals how what are you doing from sustainability perspective. So he will look at
5:48:57
sustainability making the product more sustainable from that uh from that perspective also opportunities to make
5:49:03
products more sustainable and accordingly they are upgrading the existing product portfolio. So these
5:49:09
decisions lie with the product line product manager. So strategic decisions for product line. Another one how to
5:49:14
keep product line modernized and relevant. Yeah. Uh number five product
5:49:19
line profitability analysis. Again you know they check what kind of revenues you are making. So not every product in
5:49:26
product line contributes to equal contributes equally to profitability. You know some products might make uh you
5:49:33
know x revenue other products might make y revenue and but based on that
5:49:38
strategic decision must be made about which products to promote which products to discontinue or modify based on the
5:49:45
contribution to the bottom line. Do you know I was not knowing before
5:49:51
couple of years when I did you know my masters then I came to know but then I realized okay people do talk about it
5:49:57
very frequently and I was not knowing what is top line what is bottom line so top line is uh so these lines depicts
5:50:04
your uh profit and loss financial statement or overall revenue for example
5:50:10
if you are product manager top line defines overall revenue generated by your product what is the bottom line for
5:50:15
your product again it's a financial term Amul says by subtracting expenses and operating cost and interest what but
5:50:21
what does that profit called as yes yeah it is called as a net profit so bottom line talks about net
5:50:28
profit so if you look if you read this line every product in the product line
5:50:33
contributes equally to profitability strategic decisions must be made about which products to promote which products
5:50:40
to discontinue or modify based on their contribution to bottom line so product
5:50:45
line manager Okay, revenue is important but what is more important for the organization? Net
5:50:51
profit. Net profit is more important than topline because you know if you
5:50:56
look at you know if you if it is a retail product you are uh it again depends upon the size and scale of the
5:51:03
product. Uh but how much revenue compan is making that is important but it is
5:51:08
more important is how much is your profit because profit will define the growth for your organization net profit.
5:51:15
So as a product manager you will be more worried about bottom line than top line. But essentially as I told once in a
5:51:20
quarter you will review all your products not only from you know what we discussed about um and not only about
5:51:26
sustainability and you know the customer complaints and all those things but also you are doing it from uh revenue
5:51:33
perspective and accordingly you will make decisions. What are the decisions you will make it product life cycle evaluating which product sits in life
5:51:39
cycle which product sits in which life cycle stage. So introduction, growth, maturity, decline. So typically even
5:51:46
though product manager will define it but product line manager will have overall understanding about each
5:51:51
products in that product line whether the product is in growth or whether that particular product is in maturity and
5:51:58
accordingly he will do the review and he will decide whether to invest it or whether to phase it out. Example the
5:52:04
classic iPod once a flagship product was discontinued by Apple after uh you know
5:52:09
iPhone over took its market. So iPod you know I know at that time around 2007 78
5:52:16
I would say it was very famous product iPod iPod iPod but once they launched iPhone they discontinued iPod cost
5:52:22
benefit analysis analyzing the cost of maintaining and marketing a product
5:52:28
versus revenue it generates. It's called as a costbenefit analysis. Example, a
5:52:33
company might discontinue a product that has low sales volume but requires high marketing cost. But essentially your
5:52:40
volume is also low, top line is low, marketing costs are high, net profit will be eventually low because revenue
5:52:46
is low and costs are high. So you might decide to discontin it. So all those
5:52:51
decisions you know about the product line profitability analysis and making the decisions on a product line that is
5:52:58
the responsibility of product line product managers. Okay, last one. Product line
5:53:03
consistency. A product line consistency refers to how closely related the products within the line in terms of
5:53:09
use, production, distribution, strategic decisions involving involve determining whether to maintain or expand the
5:53:18
consistency. Now let's go back. I'll ask one question. Why consistency is
5:53:23
important? Why product line manager should ensure that there is a
5:53:28
consistency in the products? Please don't read the next lines. I think I would like you to spontaneously think
5:53:35
and talk about it. So you are using reusability for your application. But in general having a consistency will reduce
5:53:42
your operation cost, your you know distribution cost all the things you know if there is a lot of consistency
5:53:48
commonality between different products within one product line. You can reuse
5:53:53
many things across multiple things. So overall you know economies of scale uh
5:53:58
another concept. So maybe I can take it later. I think too many concept today. So reusability you should be able to so
5:54:05
you'll have you have to handle less inventory. You have you don't have to train a new you know uh you don't have
5:54:12
to train your salesforce if there is a lot of consistency. So your distribution coaching sales
5:54:19
everything infrastructure will remain same. So that's what defines the consistency. So consistency will define
5:54:24
your operations and marketing cost. And again if you are increasing your top line if you are because of consistency
5:54:31
you are not increasing your operations cost to a wider range because there is lot of
5:54:37
consistency and then what you are going to get you are going to get more bottom line you are going to get more net
5:54:43
profit that's the intention that's why one of the strategic decision for a product line manager is to maintain the
5:54:49
good product line consistency so strategic consistency highly consistent product line product that are closely
5:54:55
related to its function, market segment, production, process. So for example, C offers consistent product line of oral
5:55:02
hygiene products, toothpaste, mouthwash, toothbrushes that target specific customer need. Expanding into new
5:55:09
categories. Sometimes companies decide to diversify their product line to capture new markets leading to a lower
5:55:15
consistency. Example, Amazon originally online bookstore expanded its product line into electronics, apparel, cloud,
5:55:22
computing, groceries creating a less consistency. But uh you know this case
5:55:27
you know they were originally were only for bookstores they expanded into electronics nowhere related to bookstore
5:55:34
apparel totally different cloud computing totally different grocery is totally different so consistency is very
5:55:41
very low if you look at this products but there is a diverse product mix as long as they can able to
5:55:48
maintain a good profitability it's okay but uh having a consistent product good
5:55:54
consistency will definitely reduce the operations cost. So for Amazon, I think there was a different need because at
5:56:00
that time there was no e-commerce player for electronics. So they have a separate market. So they decided that
5:56:07
even though I might increase my operations cost but this area was not been touched by anybody else and I can
5:56:13
go for additional profits since nobody's there in the competition. So even though my operations costs are high, I'll still
5:56:19
go for electronics as a target market. So that was a different story. But the consistency wise that decision was on a
5:56:26
lower scale. There was very low consistency. Okay guys. So what we understood? We understood uh what are
5:56:33
the key decisions product manager will make. Product line manager will make decisions about length decisions about
5:56:39
differentiation decisions about extension you know horizontal vertical cannibalization risk why you know
5:56:45
modernization profitability related decision. Based on that you will decide which phase of the
5:56:52
product line shall I move it to next phase in the product life cycle phase
5:56:57
and what kind of consistency I have do I need to improve my performance from consistency perspective so since it is
5:57:04
very niche and I'll take a case wherein you have a monopoly market monopoly or
5:57:10
oligopoly market so definition of monopoly so monopoly definition is you are the only one in the market who ising
5:57:16
who is supplying the products or service to that market. It is called as a monopoly. Oligopoly means you have one
5:57:24
or two competitors but uh mostly it is handled by all the industries handled by
5:57:29
uh two or three players. So and the third one category is perfect competition. So these are you know I
5:57:36
think uh if you go to MBA microecon macroeconomics 101 so they call I'll just type these words monopoly
5:57:44
first one oligopoly second one perfect competition so these
5:57:51
are the different types of industries your industry either be monopoly or it oligopoly or it is a perfect
5:57:57
competition. So monopoly you are the only one oligopoly whole industry is handled by couple of players and perfect
5:58:04
competition means there are n number of players for example uh perfect competition I can take apparel industry
5:58:10
you have lots of players available into the industry so that is perfect competition. So if you see the gross
5:58:16
margin you know the bottom line bottom line will be always highest for monopoly
5:58:21
in oligopoly it will be better but not as high as monopoly in perfect
5:58:26
competition it is the least you know typical gross margin percentage for
5:58:32
perfect competition industry is not even uh 10%age or 20%age but that you know if
5:58:37
you go for monopoly industry players will make uh more than 100%age profit. So if the overall cost for a
5:58:44
product is 100 rupees the selling price will be more than 200. So that kind of profits they will enjoy. So now let's go
5:58:51
back to the question. It's a very niche market you know I would consider it as
5:58:56
either monopoly or oligopoly. And the question is uh since it is very niche market uh how can I
5:59:04
you know uh go for line stretching horizontal what are those things
5:59:10
horizontal extension vertical extension and all those decisions how can I make it so my uh you know the feedback to
5:59:17
Amul's question is first of all I think he should try to understand is there a need for extension so all those
5:59:24
decisions you will make based on if there is a need so you will Work closely with marketing team. You will try to
5:59:30
understand what are the issues marketing you know customers are facing. Are they happy with your c you know products? If
5:59:36
they are if they are not happy you know what kind of requirements are there which are not been captured by your
5:59:42
product. So are they you know are they looking for you know uh premium features
5:59:48
in your product. If the answer is yes then yes product as a product line manager you should think of uh upgrade
5:59:54
upward stretch wherein you would like to vertically extend the product line. If they look for you know the customers are
6:00:01
very much price sensitive they would like to go for a budget product which even though it has a minimum basic
6:00:07
feature still they are okay because their application is in that that particular category. In that case you
6:00:12
can think of vertically downward line extension you are creating
6:00:17
a product catering to that particular need. So everything depends upon you know what kind of customer requirements
6:00:23
are available. If you justify if you have a good requirements which doesn't uh if you have the requirements which
6:00:29
are not been captured by your existing product portfolio then definitely you should go for product line extension
6:00:35
even though it is niche market. In fact, you know, I can take my example. I work in the industry. It is oligopoly. So,
6:00:42
lamb research provides the machines or our products are being used for uh chip
6:00:49
manufacturing. And uh if I look at overall industry, we uh you know, so we
6:00:56
have one product line which is called as H product line wherein we are complete monopoly. We have another product line
6:01:01
called as a deposition product line for which there is a competition from applied materials. So it is oligopoly.
6:01:08
So we either are in monopoly or in olopolistic environment. As I told you
6:01:13
know our profit margins are I don't sell any product which has a profit margin less than 80%age. If I sell a product
6:01:20
with profit margin less than 80%age I have to I'm answerable to all you know
6:01:25
many many stakeholders. There has to be a solid case wherein I'll make profit margin less than 80%. So that kind of
6:01:31
industry I mean very niche industry uh but still are there any possibilities
6:01:37
for product line extension? Yes there are in fact I can give one example where in uh uh current currently whatever
6:01:44
products are there in the market you know we are getting the feedback that they are not smart enough you know for example uh preventative maintenance. So
6:01:51
for example uh identifying there is a feature called as a
6:01:57
predictive maintenance preventative maintenance predictive maintenance wherein it talks about even though your
6:02:02
machine has not been failed I have a feature which can tell that okay even though machine is working properly still
6:02:09
it might fail in future in next 1 month or two months. So accordingly you know
6:02:15
uh you I can go for servicing and all those maintenance activities. So that is called as a preventative maintenance
6:02:20
feature and customer was telling that suddenly one particular component fails and because of that whole line gets
6:02:27
disturbed and it is creating a huge billion dollar loss for the end customer. So that was the problem
6:02:33
statement. So what our company did it that you know we added lot of uh sensors
6:02:38
and actuators in in in into our existing products which can cause what is the
6:02:43
lifetime for those key components which might get failed uh which might which which fails very frequently and then we
6:02:51
launched a new product called as a sensi platform. Sensi stands for there are multiple sensors are there and I can
6:02:56
provide a feature wherein uh I can tell okay boss your product is going your machine is going to get failed please go
6:03:03
for maintenance activity because of wear and tear because of some signals are not coming properly or it has advanced diagn
6:03:10
diagnostic features. So like that you know we created a new segment and basically we launched it into this was
6:03:16
under vertical product line extension. It was uh uh upgrade upward vertical
6:03:22
extension. It was more premium and accordingly we launched it and it was one of the success story for our company
6:03:28
sensi product from lamb research. So even though it is niche there are possibilities. Okay. I'm also good.

6:04:17
okay, last topic from module number nine uh BCG metrics. Even though I think uh you know uh top three big consulting
BCG Matrix in Product Management
6:04:23
companies which are all the top three big consulting companies and any MBA graduate graduate will have a dream to
6:04:29
work in that company. KPMG it is audio basically accounting based.
6:04:35
So, KPMG is big four. Ey is also big four. I was looking for big three. Yes,
6:04:40
Ken says MBB. So, what's the length form? First one M stands for McKenzie. B
6:04:46
stand for uh BCG and last B stands for uh Ben McKenzie, BCG, Ben, MBB. So,
6:04:53
these are deoid, PWC and all these are uh part of I think big four which are
6:04:59
specifically to accounting and financial audits and all those sector. Typically
6:05:04
for management consultant consulting uh these are the three big firms MBB McKenzie BCG and Ben what Ken has
6:05:11
mentioned. So this is very famous matrix from BCG. BCG stands for Boston
6:05:17
Consulting Group. So they came up with uh uh this matrix. So the BCG metrics also known as the BOS Boston Consulting
6:05:23
Group metrics is a strategic tool used in product portfolio management to evaluate the potential of a company's
6:05:30
product or business unit based on market growth rate and market share. Uh it is developed by Boston BCG group and the
6:05:37
matrix helps companies to allocate resources allocate resources by identifying which product or business
6:05:42
unit are worth investing in and which should be maintained and which should be closed. The MCG matrix classified the
6:05:49
products or business into four categories. So it's a typical 2x2 matrix. You know on yaxis it is market
6:05:54
growth rate and x-axis it is relative market share. So imagine a case wherein
6:05:59
you are a product portfolio manager, product line manager and you have you know four products and on x-axis it
6:06:07
talks about the product market share. What is the market share for your product and uh on yaxis it talks about
6:06:12
overall what is the growth of that product. overall growth you know of that product overall growth for the market
6:06:18
sorry pardon me overall growth for the market in which that product is served. So there are four categories you know
6:06:25
the first quadrant is uh you have a product which has a huge market share
6:06:30
and when you look at the market growth for that product is also very high. So we call it they they call it as a star
6:06:36
pointer. So they call it as a star. Okay. Quadrant number one. Quadrant number uh third totally opposite. You
6:06:44
have very less market share and overall market growth for that segment is also very very low. So they call it as a dog.
6:06:51
Fourth quadrant very very uh interesting. You have a huge market share but the market growth is very very
6:06:57
low. So they call it as a cash cow. And the second quadrant wherein you have less market share but the growth is very
6:07:04
high. So it is a question mark. So that's how they categorize the you know product into these four quadrants. And
6:07:09
each quadrant there is a different strategy to handle that product. So let's try to understand what are those
6:07:15
strategies. So first one star you know you remember this one star characteristics high market share high
6:07:20
growth market. So I have very huge market share and overall the market is growing very high for that category.
6:07:27
Stars are usually leading products in rapidly growing industry. So it requires significant investment to sustain the
6:07:33
growth. So what is your objective? company should focus on investing in and uh nurturing the stars to eventually
6:07:39
become cash cow as the market grows market growth slows. So just ignore the
6:07:45
last last statement. So eventually you have a product in which you have a huge market share and market growth is also
6:07:52
very high. So essentially you will be heavily investing in that product. You
6:07:57
will put all your best resources to work on that product because the market growth is also very high and your contri
6:08:04
your your basically market share is also high. You would like to capture maximum market for that product. So it is called
6:08:10
as a star. Second one cash go market share is high agree and market
6:08:18
growth industry is also high. Correct. There are a lot of people who are still not using you know smartphone in you
6:08:25
know best phone in India. So market growth is also high. So it is a good example. Yeah. Jio could be a star example. Let's talk about cash cow. So
6:08:33
wherein the market share is high but the growth is very low. So let's go to here.
6:08:38
Market share is very high but the growth is low. So earlier you know the growth
6:08:43
was very high but eventually technology has changed and now the growth is low but you have a good amount of market
6:08:50
share. So what you will do these are called as a cash cow. So strategy cash cow generates stable and significant
6:08:56
cash flow often minimum investment since market growth is low. So use the profit
6:09:02
from cash to fund the stars and invest in uh question mark. So essentially what they are telling so if you have a
6:09:09
product in which you have huge market share but uh market growth is low because it is on lower technology and
6:09:15
all it is telling don't kill the product you provide the minimum investment
6:09:21
minimum budgets minimum resources are required in order to sustain that product since your market share is high
6:09:26
and capture maximum revenue from the market. So that's the strategy they call it as a cash curve. These are very
6:09:32
commonly used terminologies in product world. So they say okay this product is cash cow this product is star. So that's
6:09:38
how it is cash cow. The third one is question mark. So it is basically the
6:09:45
characteristics is uh you have very less market share but the growth is very high. So question marks are often the
6:09:51
new products or business units that require substantial investment to increase their market share. So your
6:09:58
share is low but the growth is very high. It could be because you are new entrant. So what they say is that you
6:10:03
should heavily invest for question mark category also evaluate whether it is worth investing in growth this uh into
6:10:09
star or diversify it into diversify if they lack potential. So essentially what
6:10:15
we are telling is that the question mark your market share is low but the growth is high. So check the capability and if
6:10:23
it is capable if it is aligned with your overall company's vision and mission
6:10:29
whatever revenue you are getting from cash cow please pump in in uh this kind of categories question mark categories
6:10:35
so that you will increase your market share because the growth of this market is very high. The last one is dog
6:10:41
wherein you have less market share less growth. So dogs are limited growth potential and are not profitable and
6:10:49
companies typically aim to divest stocks or uh reposition them as they drain
6:10:55
resources without providing much return. So your market share is low return market growth is also low. Most of the
6:11:02
cases typically the docs category products are getting retired from the product portfolio. So these are the
6:11:07
decisions. This is how you categorize your products and accordingly you will make your product life cycle decisions
6:11:13
on those products. So you mean to say because of high claim your market share is high but uh market no but you should
6:11:20
not look at uh how much revenue your product is making. Yaxis talks about what is the market growth rate. So the
6:11:26
way in which I think um clearly talks about you know Jo example wherein market share was very high. Joe is one of the
6:11:33
dominant market share 5G when market growth is also very high because there are a lot of potential lot of people are
6:11:38
still they are not using u smartphone and they are likely to be use likely to get converted to 5G based smartphone or
6:11:46
5G based services where in Jio can cater there that service so that that's how it is so yaxis talks about overall market
6:11:52
growth so from indust insurance perspective what is the market growth for insurance sector I think there are a
6:11:59
lot of people you know still they don't have insurance I think Market growth is high for insurance sector and relative
6:12:04
to market share if I take example of um you know uh LIC LIC I would say uh their
6:12:12
market share is high and there are couple of segments where in market growth is also high so I don't consider
6:12:18
it as a second quadrant maybe we can look for some better examples this question mark quadrant okay so anybody
6:12:24
has any better example for question mark quadrant wherein you have the low market share and high market growth so we have
6:12:31
I think clear. So we discussed about star, we discussed about question mark uh cash. I
6:12:36
think it is very much clear you have huge market share but you know your product works on older technology. So instead of killing what they say just
6:12:43
provide minimum resources required for example again this can cater to 4G mobiles you know 4G mobiles from Jio you
6:12:51
know they have their own handset it it can fall under very much cash model wherein market share for that mobile is
6:12:57
very high since it was very cheap and uh even though the market is moving towards
6:13:03
5G based technology still there are lot of customer base who don't want to migrate to 5G they're happy with their
6:13:09
you know 4G phone So with the minimum what JO should do they should not discontinue 4G based mobiles. They
6:13:15
should provide minimum resources required in order to sustain you know this uh particular product line but they
6:13:22
will get huge revenue from this one and they should use this revenue either on question mark or on star. So that's how
6:13:29
you should utilize the cash and dogs very clear you know low market share low
6:13:34
potential kill them retire the product. So that's how you should uh understand
6:13:39
this matrix. Very very famous matrix. Uh people at CXO level they use this
6:13:46
terminology. This is star for our organization. This is cache for our organization. This is doc for our organization. So you should be able to
6:13:53
understand uh what they are talking about. Okay. How BCG metric supports product portfolio management? Resource
6:13:59
allocation helps to determine which product or business units needs investment which generates cash which
6:14:05
could be phased out. Strategy planning provides insights for developing growth strategies for product with uh potential
6:14:12
and managing mature products to maintain the profitability and uh balancing portfolio ensure a balanced mix of
6:14:19
product types star cash cow question mark dogs with the both short-term and
6:14:25
profitability and long-term growth. So look at it from short-term profitability long-term growth and accordingly you can
6:14:32
act upon it. Example star new uh newer and high potential product like uh
6:14:37
advanced iPhone in growing markets. This is good example. Qashq established high revenue product like iPad and older
6:14:45
iPhone models. So Apple who don't want to discontinue this models they will still provide uh customer support for
6:14:51
those models and they consider it as a cash because uh market share is high and
6:14:57
uh but growth is low because they have already launched the new models. So that's how the cash cows are iPhone
6:15:04
older models are considered as cash cow. Question mark you know emerging technology as Ken has like rightly
6:15:09
mentioned vertical farming like augmented reality devices pod which are
6:15:15
in high growth market but requires investment to increase the market share. electric vehicle also still it is not
6:15:21
very new but still lot of in India I think there is huge potential and dog
6:15:26
products with limited success in low growth areas which may be phased out or de prioritized so see a lot of
6:15:34
information is available in this uh forum having said that I think that's it so we have completed third module
6:15:40

6:16:16
the first step towards career growth in the field of product management. So let's try to understand value. Okay.
6:16:24
So what is the meaning of creation using customer needs. So it's a foundational concept in product management that focs
Value Creation: Understanding Customer Needs
6:16:35
which are for achieving customer satisfaction, loyalty and long-term business.
6:16:41
Understand the customer need. You know the first step is identify customer need in order to create a value. So we first
6:16:48
do work with marketing team to identify customer painoint areas. The first step of value creation is identify what
6:16:53
customer actually want or what is their want or what is their need can be
6:16:58
evolved. This can be done by conducting capture voice of customers surveys
6:17:04
interviews focus. Okay. Uh prioritize the need based on value. You know again this portion we understood converting
6:17:11
those um requirement into features. Then prioritization of features we understood multiple frameworks are being used in
6:17:18
order to prioritize the features. Moscow model, Kono model two more. So yeah so this we we know how
6:17:27
to do it. And then third point is new you know define the value proposition. Once the needs are understood product
6:17:33
manager work to articulate a clear value proposition for the product. So what is
6:17:38
value proposition? So this is the statement that describes how the product or service solve the customer
6:17:44
and improves customer situation. The specific benefits customer can expect and why they should choose your product.
6:17:51
You call it as a value proposition. Some people call it as a USP. What is the USP of your product? Some people call it as
6:17:57
what is the value proposition of your product. So why customers should buy your product? Essentially you have to define that value proposition. A strong
6:18:04
value proposition is critical for aligning product development efforts with customer expectation. So you
6:18:10
supposed to have comp uh which will motivate all which should
6:18:17
drive overall development process and which also should include uh customer
6:18:23
uh once you have developed a value proposition designing the solutions around the need. So in this step product
6:18:28
manager collaborate with you know we know design engineer and other teams to create a solution tailored to these
6:18:34
identified needs. This might involve uh developing new features improving could
6:18:39
be existing improving the existing features or even even uh reimagining
6:18:45
prototyping usability testing are often used to validate the solution whether solution addresses the customer needs
6:18:51
effectively before going for volume pro volume launch or volume
6:18:57
Okay. So designing sol the need point number five is continuous learning. You know you that's what we do as a part of
6:19:03
MVP. You use agile methodology. You develop you know uh segregate your
6:19:08
overall product development into small small packets. You go for um prototyping. It could be low fidelity or
6:19:15
high fidelity. You create the MVP for that um set of functions features. You
6:19:21
release it for some targeted customers. You ask them to use it. you learn the feedback and accordingly you improve it.
6:19:27
So it's a continuous learning process. So that's how overall you are. So just
6:19:32
to give couple of examples uh identifying the customer needs. Let's take example of fitness app company
6:19:39
wants to improve the user engagement through surveys and interviews. they understood that um their user base you
6:19:45
know whatever target you there they are struggling to work to work out alone and are often
6:19:54
unsure how to vary the exercise routine. So that's the problem statement. So what
6:20:00
approach uh they conducted you know detailed market survey to identify pain
6:20:06
points by analyzing survey responses conducting interviews they find that many users want accountability and
6:20:13
personalized exercise plan to stay on track
6:20:18
okay so that's the customer need customer uh so prioritization you know
6:20:24
so let's in this case I think uh let's use model so example is in this fitness app is uh the team identifies several
6:20:32
potential improvements. So it could be social features for accountability,
6:20:38
personalized work workout plan, uh gamified rewards. They realize that uh
6:20:46
personalized workout plan address a primary user pain point and might provide most uh direct value.
6:20:53
These are the painoint areas and the feature is uh personalized. So approach is let's use cano model. So
6:21:00
basic need must have is reliable workout tracking. So in personalized plan you
6:21:06
have multiple features. So first feature you know basic feature it should have reliable
6:21:12
uh performance need uh personalized workout plans and excitement need uh gamified rewards you know you can it
6:21:20
will capture how many calories you have burned and accordingly you'll get some points. So that is excitement need. So
6:21:25
they decided to prioritize personalized plans and schedule socialized features
6:21:30
and gamification for later releases ensuring that uh the solutions will have
6:21:36
an immediate impact. So that's how you understood customer painoint areas converted into them into
6:21:42
features prioritize them prioritize the features and accordingly you decided okay which features I would like to go
6:21:48
for current development development. What is the value proposition?
6:21:55
Example for this application, you know, value proposition is stay motivated with a fitness app that provides provides
6:22:02
personalized workout plan tailor uh helping you build consistency,
6:22:09
accountability and variety in your fitness routine. Yeah. Yeah. So there are two things what you need to do once
6:22:16
you get this kind of feedback that okay I have done thorough research based on that I launched one product into the
6:22:22
market or feature into the you know in the product and then I launched it and then I get kind of negative feedback people are not happy with my features so
6:22:30
try to understand why they are not happy you know that's where continuous learning and iteration come into the picture you know they might say
6:22:36
processor is low it is be giving it is very slow they might say you know the UI
6:22:42
is not good they might say Okay, this you should have some additional features along with this feature. So like that
6:22:48
you will get some feedback. So incorporate that feature, incorporate that uh you know feedback and
6:22:53
accordingly enhance your feature. That is the first thing you will do it parallelly. So since uh you are getting
6:22:59
the negative feedback that means this feedback was never been captured during your first level of market research. So
6:23:06
there were additional needs which were not properly captured. So you have as a lessons learned you have to capture all
6:23:11
those things and you have to make sure that whenever you are floating the surveys for your next product or you know next iteration of existing product
6:23:18
you have to ensure that all those lessons are captured and your uh you know kind of questions you ask in the
6:23:23
interview what kind of survey questions you ask in the surveys. These are very well matured so that in the next
6:23:29
iteration at least you get the actual pulse of the market. So these are the two steps you should do it as a part of
6:23:36
uh yeah so this is the example for each of these step identify customer needs of fitness app. So you did the cono model
6:23:42
defining the value proposition it's important you as a product manager should have very much clarity about what
6:23:48
value what is the value propos designing the solutions so I think process tracker and all
6:23:55
uh fine so you any questions on value proposition so value proposition is unique selling point why customers
6:24:02
should buy your product or service uh a simple
6:24:08
okay uh designing solutions yeah once you value proposition. Example, the fitness s team decided to add a new
6:24:14
features that offer customized workout plan based on user preferences. Okay,
6:24:19
personalized fitness levels. Uh the feature also includes uh progress tracker that helps users to visualize
6:24:26
their achievement over time. Okay, it will have a very good dashboard about how what is the progress, what you did
6:24:32
in last week, what you did in last month. approach uh you know collaborate
6:24:38
with UX designer and engineer uh to develop a prototype for the personalized workout planner. They conduct a
6:24:44
usability test to ensure that user can effectively navigate the features, customize their plans, track progress.
6:24:52
Feedback from this test is used to refine the design before full scale
6:24:58
implementation like a prototype or MVP kind of approach. But uh see once you have value proposition once you have
6:25:04
problem statement you came up with a solution and then you know agile methodology UIUX development MVP will
6:25:09
come come into the picture continuous learning as we discussed with I think Shoubang uh you get a feedback you
6:25:14
improve you get a feedback you improve and you make sure that you are on track so that's the overall process about
6:25:20
value creation important factor is value proposition we understood what is value proposition
6:25:26
so for example now I worked in three organizations so I kind of thought okay
6:25:32
what is the value proposition for my organization. So if I look at Lamb research
6:25:37
so I created a value proposition. So it is a leader in semiconductor
Defining Value Creation
6:25:42
manufacturing equipment and services and it empowers the world's top chip maker.
6:25:48
It could be Intel, it could be DSMC to achieve unprecedented efficiency,
6:25:54
innovation and precision. Our products are highly efficient. Our products are
6:25:59
very much innovative. Our products are basically they give very good uh
6:26:04
precision for those applications. Our advanced wafer fabrication equipment and process solutions are designed to meet
6:26:11
demands for rapidly evolving digital words. So some since now everything is
6:26:17
becoming digital you know we have lot of uh IoT devices everything is becoming
6:26:22
digital. So that's where our company will come into the picture for all those semiconductor manufacturing. We are the one who are going to provide the
6:26:28
solution enabling creation of next generation electronics that drive the global progress. So it's a bit complex
6:26:35
and comprehensive but this is the value proposition for my organization. So previously I worked in Mercedes-Benz. So
6:26:41
what is the value proposition for Mercedes-Benz? So it's uh Mercedes-Benz is like icon for luxury performance and
6:26:47
innovation. Provides more than just a vehicle you know it delivers
6:26:53
unparalleled uh driving experience. Get a best driving experience. Uh emboding
6:26:59
elegance, cutting edge technology, commitment to quality. Each Mercedes
6:27:06
vehicle is crafted uh to elevate uh everyday journey combining heritage with
6:27:12
visionary advancement that shapes future automotive luxury. What is the unique selling point for
6:27:18
Mercedes-Benz? You get uh very good driving experience. Mercedes is known
6:27:23
for its uh luxury features. That is the value proposition. So nowbody
6:27:30
tell me what is the value proposition for your organization. You need not to make a comprehensive line. Maybe you
6:27:37
tell me what are the unique selling points for your organization. Maybe I'll take uh three examples and then we can
6:27:42
move to the next. Okay. Good. So since we understood the value proposition concept and we
6:27:50
understood how do we create a value. Now second point
Value Communication Strategies
6:27:55
as a product manager responsible for uh communicating the so
6:28:01
there are some best practices you know so communication strategies these are the methods tactics used to convey the
6:28:07
product's uh value to customer efficient uh this involves uh clearly communicating how the product meets
6:28:13
customer needs stands out from competitor and provides benefit that so there are some best practices I think uh
6:28:21
there are eight one first One is uh craft a clear value proposition. You know a well- definfined value
6:28:27
proposition serves as the foundation for value communication. Should have very clear simple value proposition easy to
6:28:33
understand. Concise statement that explain what makes this product valuable or unique. This statement should
6:28:39
highlight the specific customer needs you know uh the product addresses the key benefits it provides and what
6:28:46
differentiates it from the competitor. Um so please make sure make sure that you know I think we had three criteria
6:28:53
one is um size it should focus on customer need benefits it provides and
6:28:59
what it what differentiates it from competitor so that's how it should be example product is an eco-friendly
6:29:05
cleaning solution the value proposition should be an eco-friendly cleaning product that is safe for your family
6:29:13
and effective on tough stain without harming the environment. So that's the
6:29:19
value proposition. So make sure that uh you cover all those three aspects.
6:29:25
Second best practice understand uh the segmentation or target audience. You know this you will do it as a part of
6:29:32
marketing. You know you know what is your target audience. So you should have good understanding about your target
6:29:38
audience. So what it talks about effective communication requires deep understanding about uh okay which are
6:29:43
all the target audience for this product. Segmental ring this. so that you can customize tailor this message to
6:29:50
resonate with each segment's specific needs and segment allow for targeted
6:29:56
messaging that uh speaks directly to the pain points or desires specific
6:30:02
whether based on demographics or or buying motives. Example, you know, for
6:30:07
all natural skin care brand brand segments could include environmentally
6:30:13
conscious customer, people with sensitive skin, health focused individuals. Each group would receive
6:30:19
tailored message that aligns with their specific value and the concerns. So try
6:30:24
to understand you know the target target audience and based on that audience you
6:30:29
have to tailor your uh value proposition for your product. So you might have some variants you know you might have variant
6:30:36
for sensitive skin you might have some you know variant for oily skin and
6:30:41
accordingly you have you know that perive variant and accordingly you can customize the value proposition for your
6:30:46
product considering so go back to you know big picture when
6:30:53
you do u a capstone project it is expected that you will include all those
6:30:59
points when you are drafting a value proposition Choosing the right communication channel
6:31:05
very very important. So because uh different customers engage on a different platform. So selecting a right
6:31:11
channel is crucial to reach the intended audience. Uh channel may include you know social media, email marketing,
6:31:18
inapp notification, blogs, influencers, partnership or instore display depending
6:31:23
upon whether the target audience whether where the target audience spend the time. So for example, if you are looking
6:31:31
for your target audience, if it is young generation, you can go for Instagram or Tik Tok where they spend more time
6:31:37
because they could be more effective platforms for you know if your target audience is business professionals for
6:31:44
example if you are doing the value proposition for Jira or Trello project management still product project
6:31:50
management kind of application or product in that case more likely you will choose LinkedIn
6:31:57
over Instagram or Tik Tok because that is more suitable platform for that application. So choose
6:32:04
another best practice is use storytelling to highlight benefits and solutions. So storytelling can make a
6:32:10
products value feel relatable or memorable. This involves uh sharing real world scenarios, customer testimonials
6:32:17
or brand stories that show how the product solves the problem or enhances customer life. Storytelling also helps
6:32:24
uh humanize the brand making it easier for customers to connect. So it is kind
6:32:30
of emotional connect. So if fitness tracker brand might share the story of customer who use the product to achieve
6:32:37
their health goals showing how it has transformed their uh daily habits and
6:32:43
helped them to lead healthier lifestyle. So now slowly we are we are trying to
6:32:48
understand okay the impact of this value proposition. kind of advertise you will put is also depend upon the value
6:32:55
proposition your target group. So uh storytelling will come into the picture. So you need to come up with some
6:33:01
testimonials. So this guy you know he had a problem he started utilizing our
6:33:06
product and he got benefited. So try to keep your more storytelling to have emotional connect with
6:33:14
another uh we have a couple of more best practices. Focus on benefits or
6:33:19
features. features you know it is like a theoretical explanation about features
6:33:25
and you know in detail but you focus on more benefits what customer is going to get. So rather than just long battery
6:33:32
life in the product can be position positioned as enabling you to stay connected throughout your day without
6:33:39
worrying about char recharging. So look at it from u positioning position it
6:33:46
from customer benefit. It's a very good example you know
6:33:51
are going to develop a value proposition for for example uh earpod. So you should
6:33:58
not say okay I have long battery life instead of that you can positioning it as enabling this use this product which
6:34:04
will enable you to stay connected throughout your day without worrying about recharging. So focus on features
6:34:11
not focus on benefits sorry not features that's the message
6:34:17
build trust credibility trust building tactics include showcasing reviews
6:34:22
testimonials case studies expert endorsements or guarantees to reassure
6:34:28
the customers of products effectiveness and reliability. Authenticity is critical here as union viewer or
6:34:36
endorsement can significantly influence purchase decisions. Example, a milk kit delivery service could share the
6:34:42
customer testimonials and ratings on their website and offer satisfaction
6:34:48
guarantee to remove the risk of first time risk for first time customers. So
6:34:55
use those you know customer testimonials and ratings on website so that you know
6:35:01
you can pull in the first time buyers. So build the trust, build the credibility.
6:35:08
Ensure uh consistency across touch points. For the value message to resonate it needs to be consistent
6:35:14
across all customer touch points from ads to social medias to website contents, emails. So you should have a
6:35:20
single theme which resonates with the different uh platforms that you are going to use it. A consistent message
6:35:27
build brands recognition and reinforces the product value. Create a cohesive
6:35:32
brand experience that strengths the customers trust and loyalty. A premium
6:35:38
luggage brand that emphasize durability and elegance should reflect these values across every channel from its website
6:35:44
design packaging to its customer service approach. Everywhere you should focus on
6:35:49
um you know durability, elegance, try to remain consistent
6:35:55
and adapt our message over time. You know as customer needs and market changes dynamically you should uh adapt
6:36:02
it over a period of time. So productivity app might initially emphasize on time-saving features but
6:36:08
later pivot it to work life balance as more users seek solutions to manage
6:36:13
remote work. So adopted over a period of time. So these are kind of uh best practices in when it comes to value
6:36:20
proposition. So value proposition uh should be clear. You should understand uh target audience and
6:36:27
accordingly you should put use right channel in order to use those uh advertise and all those activities.
6:36:34
Use the storytelling, use testimonials, focus on benefits. You remain consistent.
6:36:41
build trust and credibility and um be flexible to adopt over a period of as I
6:36:48
told uh when I ask you to develop a value proposition for your product I'm expecting that you use all those best
6:36:55
practice okay uh co-creation with customer I think a small topic uh so
6:37:01
co-creation with customer plays a powerful role in enhancing value communication by involving customer in the product development and messaging
Co-Creation with Customers
6:37:07
process this approach allows companies to understand and integrate customer insights directly resulting in products
6:37:14
and messaging that uh resonate more effectively. So example
6:37:20
message is uh be customercentric. So you are bringing customer in all those steps
6:37:25
and directly align with customer needs and preferences. So by involving customer early companies get clear
6:37:30
understanding of their needs, preferences and expectations. This uh firsthand knowledge leads to more
6:37:36
relevant product features and benefits which are easier to communicate effectively. So always have
6:37:42
uh keep the customer centricity. A software company working with customer during the development might learn that
6:37:49
customer values simplicity and speed or extra features leading them to focus
6:37:54
their messaging on those core benefits. So that's the whole intent of going for
6:37:59
agile development going for MVP wherein you capture the customer feedback
6:38:05
immediately. So and you learn on it. So directly align with customer needs and preferences. So when you are working on
6:38:12
value proposition there also you develop it talk to your target customers and
6:38:17
accordingly adjust it building authentic stories and testimonials. I think we discussed
6:38:23
creating a sense of ownership and loyalty. Um to take an example, a car company involves customer in design
6:38:30
choice for a new model can inspire participants to advocate for brand as
6:38:35
they feel a personal connect to the product and its story. So when customer
6:38:41
feel involved in the creating product they are more likely to feel invested in it and uh share positive word of mouth
6:38:49
or act as a brand ambassador. So typically they do it you know it is very smart marketing
6:38:54
strategy. you know you ask customer for uh the options you basically give options and ask customer okay I'm trying
6:39:01
to develop a new vehicle you tell me what kind of specifications I should finalize then customer will vote for it
6:39:08
and it is more likely that those people have voted for it they will get converted into your customers sense of
6:39:14
ownership royalty generate feedback for clear customercentric messaging a
6:39:19
skincare brand testing prototype with customer learns that the user describes the product as calming
6:39:25
ing guiding the brand's message to reflect these attributes instead of technical
6:39:32
as I think we learned in best practices. Focus on benefits rather than features and tech
6:39:38
increase trust and transparency. A tech company shares uh behind the scene look
6:39:43
at customer testing and feedback process shows the potential customer that
6:39:48
product has been validated by real user strengthening the trust. So this is this comes into the picture when you're
6:39:54
finalizing the ad content. So behind the scene you know how did you develop the product, how did you tested the product.
6:40:00
So you you can you are increasing the trust basically. Uh staying responsive to your
6:40:06
customercentric needs. Uh co-creation is a continuous feedback loop that allows brands to stay attenuated
6:40:14
to changing customer needs and preferences making it easier to update messaging and keep it relevant. A
6:40:21
beverage company for example regularly works with customer to might update its uh marketing to
6:40:28
highlight the newer flavor developed based on the customer demand and showing responsiveness to customer pre
6:40:34
uh reducing assumptions and increase product market fit. uh by involving customers directly company minimizes the
6:40:41
risk of misjudging what customer value most the product a product that can
6:40:47
genuinely meet the customer needs is easier to communicate effectively as it
6:40:52
uh delivers a real demonstrable value an app developer involving user in early
6:40:57
testing avoids adding unnecessary features allowing for straightforward
6:41:02
value messaging focused on the core benefits so involve them earlier learn from them learn from the initial
6:41:09
feedback. Create a community of engaged users and other uh best practice.
6:41:14
Co-creation foster community of engaged customers who feel they are contributed to the product success. Creating an
6:41:20
organic network of advocates who shares their positive experiences thus
6:41:25
amplifying the value communication. and a fashion brand that invol invites customer who vote on the new designs
6:41:33
create a loyal fan base then shares the product news and purchase in support of
6:41:40
the brand mission. So involve them use community discussions for positive
6:41:45
publicity. So these are kind of best practices in value communication. Mostly
6:41:51
when it comes to developing ad campaign, you have to ensure that these points are
6:41:56
again uh these are good to know. You are not the one who is going to decide the ad campaign. But uh when
6:42:04
you know marketing has developed and ad campaign you have to assess that whether uh it touches all those points whether
6:42:11
it is clear whether it understand whether it is aligns with target market are we using the right channels
6:42:18
uh are we using you know kind of testimonials are we covering are we explaining the benefits or are we
6:42:24
talking about features uh all those things you can target and
6:42:30
accordically you can provide the approval for that particular ad campaign or uh explaining the value proposition
6:42:37
to the end customer. So this is the lesson from this this one typically
6:42:42
during ad campaigns we have to make sure that you are assessing the message with
6:42:47
reference to. So see if you observe always we are uh working with some
6:42:52
stakeholder and we are trying to have the basic understanding of that domain. So earlier you know to capture the
6:43:00
customer requirement we worked with marketing team we understood okay how they capture the voice of customers. So
6:43:06
even though it is their roles and responsibilities you should know how they do it because you are the product manager you should ask them the right
6:43:11
questions. So now it comes value proposition. Value proposition okay you are the one who will define the value
6:43:17
proposition for your product. But value delivery is mostly you know they do it uh ad campaigns and all marketing team
6:43:23
they do it. But why are you learning all these things? because you should be able to ask them the right questions and you
6:43:28
should be able to check whether it aligns with uh the best practices in
6:43:33
okay so I hope you guys got a good uh understanding about value proposition
6:43:38
best practices for value communication uh value delivery you know traditional
6:43:43
versus contemporary models uh there are couple of uh differences so let's try to understand and traditional
Value Delivery: Traditional vs Contemporary Models
6:43:51
value delivery model and contemporary value delivery model uh traditional model focus on delivery value at a
6:43:56
single point of time like you know product purchase while contemporary models emphasize on ongoing value
6:44:02
creation customer centricity and adaptability. So let's try to go in detail about what
6:44:08
is the traditional value delivery models. A traditional model are often product focused and transactional in
6:44:15
nature emphasizing on delivery of finished product to the customer. The relationship between company and the
6:44:22
customer usually ends up when the trans once the transaction is completed you sell it that's it you know the
6:44:27
relationship is over over there here there are some key characteristics for traditional so productentric approach
6:44:35
you know traditional models focus on productcentric approach primary source of value with limited
6:44:41
emphasis on additional services and customization uh linear process value delivery follow straightforward process
6:44:46
you can call it as a linear or you can call it as a Waterfall methodology uh design, production, marketing, sales,
6:44:53
single line. There is no MVP prototype concept. Once the product is reached this customer, the delivery of the value
6:45:00
is considered as complete. Uh limited customer interaction post sales.
6:45:05
Uh traditional models companies usually usually have limited engagement with the end customers after the sale. Customer
6:45:12
feedback may be collected periodically uh or after sign and some some delays.
6:45:18
Basically you are not actually engaged with customer after actually engaged with customer post sales standardization
6:45:24
products are products and services are usually standardized for mass production delivery with little flexibility for
6:45:30
customization personalization like a brick and motor retail company you know this is very famous uh case study uh
6:45:38
traditional manufacturing and utility service like uh water electricity where things are very fixed and uh produentric
6:45:47
clean linear process. And now if you see the contemporary models wherein, you know, they're more customercentric,
6:45:53
dynamic, they put more emphasize on um ongoing engagement, value creation. They
6:45:59
often include services, customization, digital interaction that extends beyond the initial transaction. Key
6:46:06
characteristics is customercentric, experienced driven, contemporary models focus on understanding the customer
6:46:12
needs and delivery, personalized uh or adapting value over time, iterative and
6:46:19
agile processes instead of waterfall. It is iterative agile process continuously
6:46:24
refine the products based on prototypes, MVPs and service based on real time customer feedback often using agile or
6:46:31
lean methodologies. Ongoing relationship with customers. So this model is emphasizing building a
6:46:37
long-term relationship with customer providing continuous support and updates and enhancement to ensure that sustained
6:46:44
value is delivered. Again you know pricing is also varying you know it is not a one-time price you
6:46:51
have subscription or SAS based models where in many companies they have moved uh subscription or software as a service
6:46:59
uh models where customers pay over time for continuous access of the product and update and services uh digital
6:47:06
transformation more datadriven you know digital tools data analytics AI allow
6:47:12
realtime feedback targeted marketing personalized experiences technology platforms enables business to
6:47:19
deliver more interactively and efficient process.
6:47:24
examples you know go for Netflix 45 Spotify wherein you have uh
6:47:32
you're going for uh software as a service you have subscription based models source platforms in fact Adob
6:47:40
creative cloud Microsoft 365 e-commerce with the customer relationship management Amazon you have
6:47:47
Amazon Prime membership direct to customer brands offer personalized and ongoing supports so let's take a
6:47:53
sideby-side comparison And traditional model they were very much product face specific. New models are customercentric
6:48:01
process you know waterfaller or linear. Here it is more like agile method. Customer relationship was very much
6:48:08
transaction based you know limited post sales engagement but here uh it is
6:48:13
ongoing. We are basically calculating what is the um overall cost to the
6:48:20
customer. Not only customer will buy the product and basically he will go come to
6:48:25
you for a maintenance he will come to you for upgrades he will go for additional come to you for additional services. So overall you will have
6:48:32
overall cost to the customer that perspective rather than one-time settlement customization limited here
6:48:38
high customization revenue model one-time purchase it is subscription based feedback loop uh delayed or
6:48:45
limited feedback here you are getting continuous feedback development also and during post launch also technology role
6:48:53
very much limited you use traditional systems here it is extensive datadriven
6:48:58
digital tools so these are the Value delivery methods traditional versus contemporary. Mostly now every company
6:49:05
is focused on contemporary. Everybody has now moved from agile to
6:49:11
waterfall to agile and uh many in fact you know you can take a product which is as complex as uh aeroplane engine. Now
6:49:20
uh I think Boeing buys the aeroplane engine from General Electric and General
6:49:26
Electric earlier they were selling those engines to Boeing but now they are selling this engine on a pay-per-use
6:49:33
basis wherein Boeing need not to buy those engines as a one-time purchase
6:49:39
they will use it and based on the usage they will pay money to the General Electric. So in fact you know in complex
6:49:47
hardware industries also things are getting changed from one-time purchase to subscription base.
6:49:54
So this is the sideby-side comparison. Some examples automotive traditional car
6:49:59
sales follow a transactional models where customer buy the car and the value delivery largely ends up at the time of
6:50:06
sale except you know occasional servicing. But uh contemporary for
6:50:12
example Tesla you know you you get continuous software updates that improve the vehicle performance add features
6:50:17
over time enhancing value delivery post purchase let us take software as an example so software was sold one time
6:50:24
license cost you know earlier versions of Microsoft office uh user had to buy a
6:50:30
new versions for upgrade for example and now new versions 365 subscription based
6:50:36
model you know customer receives regular updates regular bug cloud storage ongoing support creating continuous
6:50:42
value. Same is the case with e-commerce. Uh traditional brick and motor storage
6:50:48
stores primarily focused on single transactions. Contemporary Amazon offers seamless datadriven shopping experience
6:50:54
with personalized recommendations. Prime membership easy returns creating ongoing value engagement. So benefits increase
6:51:02
customer relation retention ongoing relationship with and customer continuous updates encourage uh customer
6:51:09
loyalty. As a customer you'll get lot of flexibility agility companies can adapt
6:51:14
improve products based on real-time feedback from customers from company side and you from user side al you get
6:51:20
lot of flexibility if you don't like product you company is willing to take that take back that product let's for
6:51:26
example Amazon they offer services like send back the product within 7 days or
6:51:33
10 days if you are not happy with the product performance personalized experiences customers are received
6:51:38
tailored experience and solutions that directly address unique needs. Uh new revenue revenue stream subscription
6:51:44
based models can provide more predictable and sustained revenue rather than you know one time purchase wherein
6:51:51
forecasting is very difficult. These are u key differences between traditional and
6:51:57
it is it falls under world value delivery how you would like to say. So what did we understood so far? I think
6:52:04
before going to porters I think uh that was next topic. If you understood value proposition
6:52:10
uh how to develop a value proposition, how to communicate the value, how to co-create with customer typically how to
6:52:17
assess the marketing uh when it comes to value delivery. We understood these two
6:52:22
are the models traditional versus contemporary. We understood their differences and what is the industry
6:52:28
trend things are moving. So these are the four
6:52:33
Okay fine clear. So now next topic very important uh we are going to learn the
6:52:39
new framework called as a porter's value chain framework or analysis. Uh porter
6:52:45
is the person who has done lot of work in uh strategy value proposition. I
Porter's Value Chain Analysis
6:52:51
think those of you who have uh done masters in business administration you might have gone
6:52:58
through this framework. So what is that framework? So what he
6:53:04
what Porter says he came up with a framework developed by microporter. His name is Michael Porter that helps
6:53:10
businesses to understand the specific activities within the operation that creates value for customer and
6:53:16
ultimately contribute to the competitive advantage. The model breaks down the company's processes into primary
6:53:22
activities and supporting activities highlighting how each activity adds the value and how they interact
6:53:31
to create the value chain. As a product manager, you should know
6:53:36
what are the basically uh uh where is
6:53:42
your product is positioned. So what are the primary activities? What are the supporting?
6:53:47
So let's take example of uh so this is basically a companywide. So primary
6:53:52
activities for example uh these are the core activities directly involved in
6:53:57
creating and delivering the products or service. So they include uh for example they divided primary activities into
6:54:04
four 1 2 3 4 five categories inbound logistics operations outbound logistics
6:54:11
marketing and sales and service. So look at it from you know organization's perspective some noise. Okay. So,
6:54:17
inbound logistics. So, activities related to receiving and storing and managing the inputs like a raw material,
6:54:23
components, inventory. Efficient inbound logistics can reduce the cost and ensure smooth production
6:54:30
process. So, this is something what you get input operations. The activities that
6:54:36
transform inputs into the final product such as manufacturing, assembly, packaging.
6:54:42
Streamlining the operations can increase the productivity and reduce the production cost.
6:54:48
And then output outbound logistics. It is basically the outcome of your uh
6:54:54
operations. Activities involve distributing and finishing the product uh finished product to the customer. Uh
6:55:00
this can include the warehousing, order fulfillment and delivery. Effective
6:55:05
outbound logistics can reduce the delivery times and enhance uh customer satisfaction.
6:55:12
uh and then marketing sales and services. I think these are self-explanatory activities aimed at
6:55:17
promoting and selling the product such as advertising pricing strategies and sales tactics. Uh
6:55:25
strong marketing and sales can increase the brand visibility and drive demand. Service basically the anything which
6:55:31
comes after post sales activities that supports customer including you know product installation, training,
6:55:37
maintenance, customer service. Effective service can build customer loyalty and lead to repeat business. So these are
6:55:44
typically primary activities for the organization. What are the supporting activities? Uh these are auxiliary
6:55:52
activities that help primary activities to run smoothly and efficiently. They include firm infrastructure.
6:55:58
Uh this covers organizational structure, management, financial, legal. So all all admin activities, legal activities,
6:56:04
finance activities, uh other administrative functions that keep business running. A well structured
6:56:10
infrastructure support efficient decision making and resource allocation. Then human resource management
6:56:16
activities related to recruiting, training and development. A strong practices helps to attract talent,
6:56:22
enhance productivity, foster employee satisfaction. Uh technology development. This include R&D, product design,
6:56:30
process automation, technology management of all which enhances
6:56:36
efficiency and innovation. Advanced technology can streamline the operations, reduce cost and provide competitive edge. Procurement, you know,
6:56:44
activities focused on acquiring resources, material, services needed for production. Eff effective procurement
6:56:50
ensures that input are of high quality and cost effective supporting value
6:56:56
creation in operations and logistics. So that's how Porter has divided the
6:57:01
primary activities and secondary activities. There is very good graphical representation
6:57:07
I think. Let me go back to that graphical representation. So this is your primary activities. inbound
6:57:13
logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, customer service and supporting activities, uh
6:57:20
firm uh human resource management, technology development, procurement.
6:57:26
So that's how uh uh driving for your product or for your so another concept
6:57:34
value creation and competitive advantage. Support Porter's model emphasized that each activity in the
6:57:39
value chain has potential to add value and impact a company's uh cost
6:57:45
structure. By optimizing and coordinate coordinating these activities,
6:57:51
businesses can either reduce the cost or differentiate themselves from the competition. So see this is very very
6:57:58
important. Okay. I when I learned this concept, I really
6:58:03
appreciated this framework. You take any industry. Okay. Either you
6:58:09
you have multiple competition. Either you are cost leader or you should be a
6:58:16
differentiator. So what is the meaning of cost leadership? So or cost advantage. Identifying and reducing
6:58:22
efficiencies across the value chain. Negotiating it for better contracts in procurement or automating the process in
6:58:29
operations. Companies can lower their overall cost and differentiating. Basically, companies can enhance certain
6:58:35
value activities to create a unique offering that sets them apart. Providing
6:58:40
uh superior customer service using cutting edge technology or creating a distinct brand image.
6:58:47
So whatever work you are doing on your product either it should lead into a
6:58:52
cost reduction or it should lead into your different so applying port. So
6:58:58
that's the overall summary why we are learning all those things. Applying Porter's value analysis to identify the
6:59:05
key areas of improvement. By analyzing the each activity, companies can spot on the areas to improve the efficiency,
6:59:12
quality, optimize resources or reduce the cost, enhance value for the customer by
6:59:19
focusing on the activities that directly impact customer satisfaction such as service and product quality. Companies
6:59:24
can strengthen uh proposition uh benchmark against competition. Companies can compare their
6:59:32
valuation chain activities with competitors to identify the gaps and opportunities for compet. So let's take
6:59:39
example okay lot of theory let's take example of a retail company uh what are the typical inbound
6:59:45
activities retail company will do uh streamlining supplier uh relationship to
6:59:51
get high quality products quickly at a lower cost. So what operations does
6:59:57
using technology to improve the inventory management and reduce the stockouts? So you can imagine the case of Amazon or Flipkart in one logistics
7:00:05
streamline the supply relationship get high quality products at lower cost operations use the technology for
7:00:11
inventory management. You reduce the stockouts outbound. Uh you are partner partnering
7:00:17
with logistic firms to fast delivery and implementing the order tracking marketing and sales leveraging data too
7:00:24
for personalized marketing. Uh services offer robust return policy and all those return policies excellent
7:00:31
customer services warranties and all to increase the customer satisfaction. So these are the activities you do in
7:00:38
I think same thing is represented here inbound logistics reception warehousing
7:00:44
distribution operations transformation of input into the output
7:00:50
storage transportation product distribution then marketing and sales salesforce and
7:00:56
advertising warranty maintaining and upgrades parally these are the primary activities secondary activities you have
7:01:03
systems you have routines you So human resources management technology
7:01:09
procurement and resources ensure essentially taking essentially talking
7:01:16
you take any organization it could be software hardware you have some inputs you are doing some operations and at the
7:01:22
end you are providing some output you have marketing and sales you have customer service these are your primary
7:01:28
activities which are going on in your organization parallelly you have some support functions and accordingly each
7:01:33
department is positioned So you should have uh the clarity about
7:01:38
what are your primary activities, what are your supporting activities in the organization. So that's where they use
7:01:44
this framework. And typically you know for when it comes to cost reduction and all those activities they will check
7:01:49
which are all those activities which are adding more value to the customer or adding less values to the customer and
7:01:56
how many of these activities can be outsourced. Accordingly they are uh if there is a need for cost reduction they
7:02:02
will uh eliminate those activities and they will ask you know they will uh
7:02:07
delegate these activities to some third party supplier who will do this activity for your company. So that's how they
7:02:14
address question. So let me answer so let me set the context. So Apple is the
7:02:20
company who makes you know all those iPhones and iPads and they have outsourced the manufacturing to a
7:02:26
company who does the manufacturing of all those Apple. So now why did they
7:02:32
decided not to make it instead of that they have outsourced it? Because if Apple manufacture a one mobile
7:02:40
in California or you know if they manufacture in their facility it might
7:02:45
cost you know let's take a hypothetical case of $100 per piece but if they
7:02:51
outsource it I think the Foxcon will charge not more than $40 to $50.
7:02:58
Why it is the case? So there one more um I think concept will come into the picture. It is called as economies of
7:03:04
scale. Economies of scale. So what is that economies of scale? So let
7:03:12
go to chrome. I think we might have some bit describing.
7:03:19
Okay. Yeah. I think this is the graph what I
7:03:24
Okay. Can I have simple graph? Okay. So if you take this this uh graph you know
7:03:29
on y-axis it talks about what is the cost of manufacturing and on x-axis it
7:03:34
is basically the number of units being manufactured. So if you see uh if Apple
7:03:41
has to manufacture you know there will be there will be a good amount of manufacturing but
7:03:47
typically what foxcon does it they not only manufacture for Apple they will manufacture it for multiple companies.
7:03:53
So it is basically manufacturing company. So since they have volume benefits the cost per piece is very very
7:04:00
low. So that's the only reason you know Apple has decided that okay instead of me manufacturing it I'll ask to
7:04:07
manufacture it because if they manufacture it the cost per piece is very very low and I'm telling you
7:04:12
typically that the difference is almost in the order of 30 to 40%age. If Apple
7:04:17
will manufacture it, if the cost is $100, if they manu get it manufactured from Foxcon including Foxcon profit, it
7:04:25
will not cost more than $40 per apple. So that kind of benefits they will get it. That's the reason they have decided
7:04:31
to outsource it. But I think both uh both the guys who have Amola and I think
7:04:37
AJ they have brought very very good point. What about quality? Okay, because is such a premium branded product. how
7:04:44
they are mentioning you know how they are ensuring that product is built with a proper quality so in that case you
7:04:50
know uh Apple will ask a detailed manufacturing process related documents
7:04:56
from Foxcon how are you going to manufacture it there will be detailed quality audits from Apple side and I
7:05:02
don't know how many of you are aware there were there is uh DFMA document I think those who are in forall from
7:05:08
manufacturing side design process flow effect analysis uh there will be PFMEA docu documents uh
7:05:15
so which talks about what are the different ways in which uh manufacturing you you might get some error during
7:05:21
manufacturing process. So all those things are captured. There will be thorough assessment. There will there are quality checks present at each
7:05:27
particular uh after every step and they are checking the quality and after once
7:05:33
the product is product is compliant with all the quality checks then only it is allowed to go after end of life end of
7:05:41
line basically they call it as end of line wherein they do all the last quality check. So since Apple controls
7:05:47
that document they are only asking uh you go and do the productionization but the quality check is also is controlled
7:05:54
by all those quality documents which Apple will do the sign off with Foxcon accordingly they are ensuring that the
7:06:00
quality is maintained and it is very much common you know most of the people they don't do the manufacturing by
7:06:07
themsel because there are people who will do who is focusing on the manufacturing and there is prime focus
7:06:13
is uh on doing the manufacturing at lesser and low lesser cost. So that's
7:06:18
where you know Apple and all other guys they decide to outsource the
7:06:23
manufacturing to somebody else but they don't compromise on the quality all quality checks are been properly
7:06:30
documented they are properly otherred and uh if any
7:06:36
violence any basically uh mistake what Foxcon does they'll be severely
7:06:41
penalized from Apple side. So all those uh not only about quality I think you should have the question about IP
7:06:46
related things also. So there are proper they call it as what is that uh NDA's
7:06:52
non-disclosure agreements are been signed off between you know those parties. So it is expected that Foxcon
7:06:58
will not uh use uh those designs for some other productions and if if they
7:07:03
found guilty they will be heavily pen but essentially this is the concept scale that's why you know they next
7:07:12
Saturday finish there are two tops related to value effectiveness uh module
7:07:19
is measuring the value deals. So how to how you as a product manager you have to measure whether what kind of value
Measuring Value Delivery Effectiveness
7:07:26
effectiveness is there for you uh refers to assessing how well the company
7:07:32
delivers the promised value to the customer ensuring that the product or or exceed the customer expectation and
7:07:38
create uh satisfaction by measuring effectiveness. Companies gain insights into how successfully they meet customer
7:07:46
needs and retain customers and differentiate themselves in the market. So that's the effectiveness. how well
7:07:51
the value has been delivered, value is created, how well value is delivered and accordingly how well value is perceived
7:07:57
by the current customer. So how to assess it? So typically we go for KPIs.
7:08:03
So product management is all about KPI. So you have different different KPIs. We are going to learn lot of KPIs in
7:08:09
product analytics. You know there are customercentric KPIs, there are businesscentric KPIs, there are financecentric KPIs. But in know in this
7:08:17
uh topic of this model we are trying to understand the KPIs with reference to value delivery. So just uh there are 1 2
7:08:25
3 four I think five KPIs are there. First one is customer satisfaction. Uh it called as a chat and measures the
7:08:31
degree of satisfaction with a specific interaction or the product or service overall often uh collected through the
7:08:39
service after purchase of or service experience. So you will ask customers to rate your uh product in the scale of 1
7:08:46
to 10 and accordingly you get a lot of sample data and that basically define what is your C score. You similarly you
7:08:53
have NPS score net promoter score uh it will gauge the customer loyalty by asking how likely customer are
7:09:01
uh recommend the company to others. So uh higher NPS is higher perceived value.
7:09:06
So are you recommending this product to somebody else? So that that kind of questions are captured in net promoter
7:09:13
school as a promoter. Are you willing to are you are you are going are you going to become a promoter for this product?
7:09:18
So that kind of questions you will ask and you'll capture NPS. So detailed formulas how to capture NPS, how to
7:09:24
capture Chat we are going to learn in U product analytics. But just these are the overview how to how you how are you
7:09:31
going to assess the value delivery creation. Customer retention rate indicates how effectively the customers
7:09:38
company retains the customers. High retention typically means customer feels they uh the product delivery delivers
7:09:46
the value over time. You know you have retention rate, you have active users, you have you know the users number of
7:09:52
users who have lost from your platform and accordingly you are going to calculate the churn rate you are going
7:09:58
to calculate the retention rate in terms of percentage value and basically this is another KPI to decide the perceived
7:10:04
value by the end customer. uh you have another KPI called as a customer lifetime value measures the
7:10:11
total revenue of a company can expect from customer or entire relationship
7:10:16
showing the financial impact of the effective value delivery. So if you go to traditional value and if you
7:10:22
calculate this KPI so that means the price of a product. So in traditional you know uh methodology of value
7:10:28
delivery traditional versus contemporary what we have I think understood the sideby-side comparison. So in
7:10:34
traditional value you sell the product I think that's what that's that end of the relationship between yourself and
7:10:40
customer. But in basically if you go to SAS based kind of model wherein you are going for subscription based model the
7:10:46
CLV customer lifetime value here you are calculating for one customer what is the expected revenue from that customer to
7:10:53
the company or entire relationship you know so that's what you are trying to gauge it
7:11:00
and accordingly you you have this KPI so that also will tell basically uh what is
7:11:06
the effectiveness of your value delivery you have some more metrics product or service usage metrics track how often
7:11:13
and in what ways customer use the product or service indicating its uh relevance and value in customers daily
7:11:20
lives. Uh you have some more KPIs like a first contact resolution, customer
7:11:26
effect score, effort score, customer service index. These metrics helps assess efficiency and ease with which
7:11:33
customer issues are resolved. So these are specifically service related uh matrices. So when did you launch the
7:11:39
complaint? How are you satisfied with your first response? How long typically
7:11:44
it takes for the customer to get the issue resolved. So all those KPAs are there. And this is another way to check
7:11:50
whether the value delivery is effective or not. So KPA based meth method
7:11:57
gather customer feedback and insights. Customer feedback surveys. Use surveys, feedbacks, forms, interviews. Gather
7:12:02
qualitative and quantitative insights on the customer experiences, pain points, expectations, customer reviews and
7:12:08
ratings. monitor reviews. You know, you have platforms like a Google
7:12:14
Yelp. I honestly I did not use Yelp or Trust Poert. I typically go for uh
7:12:21
Google reviews. Understand how customers feel about the product or service. Social listening track social medias for
7:12:28
customer comments. Typically comments are available in Twitter. Mostly
7:12:33
negative comments are available on the Twitter. So you can able to check uh what kind of
7:12:38
negative comments are there and accordingly you can cause whether the value delivery is effective or not.
7:12:44
Complaints praises customer advisory boards and focus group engage key customers on early adopters in
7:12:52
structured feedback sessions to understand perception of the value and areas of improvement. So these are
7:12:58
different different uh ways by which you are checking uh how customer is perceiving your product. How customer is
7:13:04
perceiving the value what it delivered to him and accordingly uh you you have
7:13:09
you can able to justify whether it is on track or whether it needs whether are some gaps and whether it needs further
7:13:15
improvement. This is the about measuring effective delivery. Once you have the
7:13:21
data you know you analyze the operational data you know delivery and fulfillment times measure how
7:13:27
efficiently products and services are delivered. It comes to basically the operations related side. Quick and
7:13:33
reliable delivery reflect positively on the value perception. Support response time as we discussed during customer
7:13:39
support. How quickly are responding to customer queries. Quality matrices measured defect rates. How many times
7:13:46
defects have been reported? Product has been reported uh returned. There were warranty claims. There is warranty
7:13:52
period on how many times product has came back because it it had violated all
7:13:57
warranty norms and there was some quality issue. High quality products within fewer with fewer issues directly
7:14:03
contribute to perceived value. Usage analytics you know typically you use
7:14:09
Google Analytics you check for software products you check how customers are
7:14:14
using those particular features. Uh for digital products track the user engagement, feature adoption and drop
7:14:21
off points to understand which part of the product deliver most value which is
7:14:26
the commonly used feature which are all the features are not been are rarely being used. So accordingly you can see
7:14:32
you can basically segregate the value delivery by each of those features and accordingly you can optimize those uh
7:14:38
features which are not being widely used. uh measuring competitive repositioning
7:14:46
uh market share, customer acquisition rate. So this is related to growth market. You know you are measuring a
7:14:52
growth market share and high acquisition rate signals the customer recognize the value. You know your revenue growth is
7:14:59
increasing quarteron quarter. Uh so that is strong indicator that you are on
7:15:04
track. Uh price comparison perceived value versus competition. Competitors
7:15:10
evaluate whether customer perceive your product as offering better value at the
7:15:15
similar or higher price to than that of a competitors. So if you have you know
7:15:20
the similar the product from the competitor which is priced at similar you know price points
7:15:26
then you have to check with customer which product they are giving for which they are feeling they're basically
7:15:33
feeling that that product is adding more. So compare it with benchmark your
7:15:38
product. Essentially that means calculate financial impact of value delivery. Uh revenue growth and profit
7:15:44
margins increased revenue growth and improved uh profit margins indicate that
7:15:49
effective value delivery translates to financial success. That's what I was uh I think customer acquisition cost versus
7:15:56
customer lifetime value ratio CAC relative to uh C was that efficient
7:16:05
value delivery since uh retained and satisfied customer brings more.
7:16:11
So the ratio of customer acquisition cost versus customer lifetime value how
7:16:16
much revenue is generated by the customer. So you know how much money you spent in
7:16:22
order to acquire the customer. You have the information about how much revenue is generated by a particular customer
7:16:28
over its uh lifetime of that product and you create that uh you know ratio and
7:16:34
that is additional you know KPIs to check uh what kind of
7:16:39
value you are delivering is it effective or not. You can also check uh repeat purchase. How many times customer has
7:16:46
repeated the purchase uh a high repeat purchase rate reflect strong value delivery as customer return when they
7:16:54
feel that product or service meets their needs. Uh set benchmarks and continuously monitor performance. U as
7:17:01
we discussed you know set internal benchmarks for each of the metric. For example,
7:17:06
uh support response time. You have a threshold value or expect close the ticket in 3 days. Accordingly,
7:17:13
you have some thresholds and accordingly you can check uh what are those cases
7:17:19
for which you have not met that threshold and what is the area of improvement. Continuously improvement
7:17:24
cycle. Use the feedback and to implement product or service improvements. Refine
7:17:29
processes. Adapt the value proposition to evolve.
7:17:36
Example process for measuring value delivery effectiveness. Collect the baseline data for customer satisfaction
7:17:42
and operational matric matrices. Gather the qualitative insights from customer feedback. Social
7:17:48
uh listening to understand customer sentiments. Monitor repeat purchase rates, customer
7:17:55
retention rates, monthly, quarterly. using the data to identify the trends. Conduct quarterly review of metrics. I
7:18:02
would say it is not happening quarterly. Typically, you end up reviewing those mattresses once in a month. At least you
7:18:08
know when you have launched the product recently comparing them into both internal benchmarks and competitor data
7:18:15
and accordingly you can make a based on the findings address the strategies improve the response time, product quality, customer support
7:18:23
you can go for feature enhancement. So this is how you are ensuring that the value is effective effectively value is
7:18:29
been delivered to the end and this is about measuring the value
7:18:35
effective. Okay. So next improving the value delivery process. So uh
7:18:40
continuation of that topic uh understanding the customer needs and expectations. I think this point is very
Improving Value Delivery Process
7:18:46
common across all the points. At the end it boils down to go back to customer and try to understand their expectation. via
7:18:53
surveys, interviews and all those things. This is very very common point in ops. Optimize operation,
7:19:01
identify and eliminate bottlenecks in production, logistics and delivery. So which slows down the overall process
7:19:09
uh implement lean processes, automation in areas where it
7:19:14
improves speeds or enhances. Uh heavily invest in quality control. I think that's uh let's go back to the
7:19:21
point wherein we were discussing about Apple has given the manufacturing to Foxcon which is which in basically
7:19:27
they're doing the manufacturing in China. So they heavily invest in quality control. Ensure that consistent product
7:19:33
or service by implementing quality assurance practices in production or service delivery. And typically they go
7:19:40
for if you heard the term six sigma other quality improvement methodologies
7:19:45
just in time lin manufacturing all those things you are going to utilize in order to me ensure that quality you are
7:19:52
manufacturing the product with uh enhance customer communication and
7:19:57
transparency. It keep customer informed about each stage of the delivery process from order confirmation to delivery.
7:20:05
Basically tracking function. Uh it will build the trust, manage expectations,
7:20:11
use digital tools like SMS or email notification. I think now generation we are going for Android application which
7:20:17
talks about uh the each small step. Okay. Product order is accepted, order
7:20:22
is packaged, order is delivered, order is in commute, order will be delivered
7:20:28
tomorrow. So all those notifications, it will build the trust and transparency. Uh leverage technology for process
7:20:35
improvements. Use data analytics, customer, CRM kind of tools to identify the patterns and optimize the
7:20:42
interactions. Implement digital platforms or apps that makes it easier for customers to
7:20:47
interact with uh access services market make purchases
7:20:53
use nowadays you know everything is you're going to use artificial AI technology in
7:21:00
all the processes which will reduce a lot of so all those KPIs and all it is expected
7:21:07
that these are ready and you'll get a good dashboard report of uh all those
7:21:12
KPIs Empower frontline employees. Train employees to provide excellent customer
7:21:18
service. Empower the employ issues on the spot to improve customer experience. Encourage culture of customer centricity
7:21:25
by aligning employee goals with customer satisfaction metrices. I think if you see you go to any customer service call,
7:21:32
you know if that customer service person if he has helped you, he will tell okay can you please rate me? So based on that
7:21:40
rating his uh salaries will get incentivized. So accordingly you are aligning the employee goals with
7:21:47
customer satisfaction metrics. So like that you are incentivizing them and uh also you you as a product manager you
7:21:53
have to make sure that uh a right information is provided adequate information is provided to customer
7:21:58
support team so that they can solve the problem in quickest manner. Monitor and
7:22:04
improve after sales support. Provide easy access to after sales support and encourage feedback to address issues
7:22:11
quickly. Often you know offer warranty, return loyalty programs to slow to show
7:22:18
customer that the business values uh their satisfaction. Make sure that you know you create a image that they are
7:22:25
important their feedback is vent and even after the purchase continuously
7:22:30
measure and refine you know I think this is this point is also very much consistent in all our most of our slides
7:22:38
uh be flexible learn from your mistakes learn from the experience and accordingly improve the processes track
7:22:44
the KPIs related to value delivery such as customer satisfaction in PS repeat
7:22:50
purchase regularly review those performance data identify where the adjustment needs to be made areas of
7:22:55
improvement and accordingly improve it. I think one example what we gave for example an e-commerce business improving
7:23:02
the value delivery process might have they might have used the data analytics
7:23:07
to predict the demand and optimize the inventory management. So basically you are trying to reduce the inventory handling cost by using advanced
7:23:13
technologies. You have historical data because you know e-commerce company it is expected that during Diwali season
7:23:19
you are expected to get higher demand. So you have historical data. Now you are going to use that data in order to
7:23:25
finalize the uh what kind of inventory you would like to uh store and
7:23:31
accordingly you are optimizing the inventory management in order to reduce the oper operational costs. Partnering
7:23:37
partnering with reliable logistics provides to ensure fast and on-time delivery. Again let's go back to whether
7:23:43
you would like to delivery function you would like to keep within your organization or you would like to outsource it to some other agency. So
7:23:50
there you know you have to make a decision as we discussed make versus by what kind of value this function is
7:23:55
adding to the customer and do you have any players in the market who can do this job better than you. So if you have
7:24:03
answers for these two questions accordingly you can decide when to do this function within the organization or
7:24:08
whether you would like offer personalized post purchase support and easy return options enhancing overall
7:24:15
customer experience are the things you should do for improving the beyond the time let's thank you

management at last we'll wrap up this session by talking about the companies that are hiring product managers and the
12:11
future of product management so without any further delay let's proceed and understand what is product management
12:18
product management is managing the process of the product throughout the life cycle from strategizing to design
12:25
and development to branding of the product product management involves
12:30
strategizing of the products to enhance business and create customers value it
12:35
also involves creating product road maps to design and develop the product it involves specifying functional
12:42
requirement and creating blueprints to develop the product as per customer
12:47
requirement once the product is developed it is important to manage the customer feedback and only then the
12:54
price of the product is finalized let us proceed and understand why product management is important so
13:02
product and Market are the two Essentials of marketing product management plays a crucial role in the
13:08
success of the product as product management is the voice of the market inside the
13:13
industry product management helps in creating customers value and business
13:19
benefits now let us proceed and talk about the areas of product management so
13:25
product management is divided into three key areas product Discovery product planning and product
13:32
development let us move ahead and know what is product Discovery and what are the various part that product Discovery
13:39
follow the very first phase of product Discovery is alignment where the team is
13:44
created and a task is allotted to the team to work on a particular project the
13:49
next phase of product Discovery is research the research work is done to
13:55
know what are the requirement of the product and what does a user need from the product product the team researches
14:01
on the problem statement and check whether the gathered data is correct or not the next phase of product Discovery
14:09
is ideation the team starts to find the solution for the problem
14:14
statement in the next phase of creation the team starts to create a prototype of
14:19
this product and test it within the team or maybe outside the in the next phase of
14:26
validation the product is validated to know whether the product is worth
14:31
spending the resource money or time or not after product validation the
14:37
refinement processes done the process of product Discovery is aligned to meet the
14:42
need of the business gos after product Discovery product planning is the next area of product
14:50
management product planning involves four steps number one identifying profit
14:56
the process is done to check the success of the product and to know what would be the profit out of it the next phase of
15:04
product planning is evaluation of the product the product is evaluated to
15:10
check the suitability and safety of the product for the users in the next phase we have allocation of the resources and
15:17
time plannings the resources needed for the product are allocated to the team and a
15:23
particular time period is planned to provide the product to the customers the last phase of product
15:30
planning is complete pre-product planning so before we start the development process it is necessary to
15:36
plan and execute every task so that the development of the product should be complete without any further
15:43
delay once the discovery and planning are done the product is moved towards the stage of the development product
15:50
development follows the process of idea the solution for the problem
15:56
statement is already there in the discovery phase now the development team start to work on that idea and start to develop the
16:03
product using that idea so once you walked into the step of product planning and you have the idea
16:11
of what to do and how to do it is important to do some market research as
16:16
well this research will look out for a market to sell your product now you got the market to sell
16:23
your product it is important to do some development of the product in the the
16:29
planning phase we have already created the Prototype of the product the Prototype is already tested in the team
16:36
so now the development team will start to develop the product using that
16:41
prototype once the product is developed product validation is done the product
16:47
validation means the product under goes the validation process where the product
16:52
is tested through every aspect of the testing process so that the user doesn't find
16:58
any difficult M using the services of the product and once the product is
17:03
validated it is launched into the market launching means to provide the services
17:09
of the product to the users now let us move ahead and talk about the life cycle of product
17:16
management the first phase of product management is product framing the step
17:21
involves creating a vision of the product and identifying problems and
17:27
defining its success the next phase of life cycle of product management is research research means to
17:34
learning from the people about the need and values of product the next phase of
17:40
life cycle is designing in this phase the team synthesize Visions ideas and research in
17:47
the Prototype of the product in the next phase of plotting the testing solution of the
17:53
product is done in the Real Time with real people after plotting the product
17:59
the product is launched into the market launching means to send your product into the wild and let it flourish and
18:07
once the product is launched into the market it is important to do the measurements measurement means using
18:14
metries and data to check the success of the product and plan the improvements for it now the question arises that what
18:22
is the difference between the areas of product management and the life cycle of product management so the the areas of
18:29
product management describe every subphase that come under every phase of
18:35
product management or that come under area of product management whereas the
18:40
life cycle of product management represents the workflow of product management as a complete
18:48
process a lot of us tends to get confused between product management and project management so let us proceed and
18:56
understand the difference between the two bold term product management leads to the external
19:01
market operations and management whereas project management leads to the management of internal
19:08
operations product management deals to the project given to the whole company
19:14
whereas the project management deals with the particular project given to the manager or the team the life cycle of
19:21
product management is product framing research design plot launch and measure
19:28
where whereas the life cycle of project management is initiating planning
19:33
executing monitoring and controlling and closing in product management manager

22:17
development and life cycle of the product from ideation to launch and Beyond the basically act as a single
22:23
bridge between different teams such as engineering design marketing and also sales to ensure that the product meets

customer needs and aligns with the company's strategic goals the product manager is often seen as a product CEO

22:43
who is the actual product manager now let's move on and discuss the top 10 skills which are required to become a
22:50
successful product manager so guys our first skill is strategic thinking then is user Centric design approach moving
22:57

23:09
then we have effective communication stakeholder management and finally negotiation and conflict resolution
23:16

23:36
with overall business strategy this skills helps in making decisions that ensures the product not only meets the

current demands but is also prepared for future challenges for example a product manager at a tech company sees that more
23:49
people are using a variable technology they propose developing a smartwatch that integrates Health tracking
23:56
communication and entertainment features positioning the company ahead of competitors so you can see certain task
24:03
is needed for a product manager in the scope of strategic thinking now let's understand our second skill that is user

preferences of its users this skill requires empathy understanding of user
24:22
behavior and a commitment to solving user Problems by focusing on user experience product managers can create
24:29
products that are not only functional but are also delightful to use for example guys a product manager at a bank
24:36
receives feedback that customers find online banking app very confusing so
24:41
they conduct user interviews and usability tests leading to redesign of the app with simpler navigation and more
24:48
intuitive interface resulting in a higher customer satisfaction so you can see what is a task for a product manager
24:55
in the domain of user Centric approach now let's move on and discuss our next skill that is product life cycle
25:02
knowledge so guys product life cycle knowledge involves understanding the different stages of a product which goes
25:09
through for example introduction growth maturity and decline each stage requires
25:14
different strategies for marketing development and resource allocation this skills helps product managers know when
25:21
to push for growth when to focus on product maintenance and when to consider phasing out a product for example a
25:27
product manager at a consumer electronics company notices that a popular smartphone model is reaching
25:33
Market saturation they decide to introduce a new model with upgraded features to keep the product line fresh
25:39
and maintain customer Interest next we have the problem solving so guys problem
25:45
solving is the ability to identify issues analyze the root cause and develop effective Solutions the skill is
25:51
crucial for navigating the challenges that arise during product development and management effective problem solving
25:57

problem solving I hope so you're getting aware like how these skills are used by product manager in their real-time job
26:29
so guys our next skill is prioritization technique so guys prioritization is a skill of determining what TK of features
26:37
should be focused on first based on their importance and impact product managers often face competing demands
26:43
and effective prioritization ensures that most critical tasks are addressed in a timely manner they use techniques
26:50
like mosom method which means must have should have could have won't have AR
26:55
rise reach impact confidence effort these techniques can help in making
27:01
these decisions for example guys a product manager for a social media app has to choose between adding a new
27:07
feature for live video streaming or improving the app security after assessing the impact of both they
27:13
prioritize the security Improvement to protect user data and build trust even if it means delaying the new feature now
27:20
let us move on to our next skill that is agile and scrum so guys agile and scrum
27:25
are the methodologies that promote Flex ibility collaboration and iterative development in product management agile
27:32
involves breaking down a project into smaller and manageable Parts allowing for continuous Improvement and a quick
27:39
responses to change scrum a specific agile framework it uses time box Sprints
27:44
to achieve short-term goals with regular reviews and adjustment for example guys a product manager at a software company
27:52
uses scrum to manage development of a new mobile app they work in two week Sprints allowing the team to release
27:58
incremental updates gather user feedback and make necessary adjustments before the next Sprint next we have guys
28:05
performance metric analysis so guys performance metric analysis involves tracking and interpreting key data
28:11
points that indicate how well a product is performing the skill is essential for making data driven decisions and
28:18
optimizing the product metrics that might include user engagement conversion rates customer satisfaction or Revenue
28:24
growth for example guys a product manager at online Subscription Service monitors customer retention rates when
28:32
they notice a decline they analyze the data that find users are dropping off
28:37
and after a free trial they introduce new feature and offer personalized discounts to improve the retention so
28:43
guys this was how performance metrics help in product management next let us move on to effective communication so
28:49
guys effective communication is the ability to clearly convey ideas expectations and feedback to various
28:55
stakeholders including team members Executives and customers this skill ensures that everyone involved in the
29:02
product development process is aligned and working towards the same goals it also involves active listening and the

management involves identifying engaging and maintaining positive relationships with all parties interested in the
29:40
product success this skill requires balancing the needs and expectations of different stakeholders including
29:46
customers team members investors and Executives it is all about building trust and ensuring that stakeholders are
29:53
kept informed and involved at appropriate stages for example guys a product manager developing a new
29:59
educational app involves teachers students and parents in the design process they gave the feedback and
30:06
adjust product features to meet the needs of all stakeholders ensuring broad support for the app and finally we have
30:12
negotiation and conflict resolution so guys negotiation and conflict resolution involve finding mutually beneficial
30:19
Solutions when there are disagreements or competing interest the skill is vital for resolving conflicts within the team
30:26
with stakeholders or during business business negotiations a product manager must be able to navigate the situation
30:32
diplomatically ensuring that the product Success is Not compromised for example guys a product manager at a
30:39
Manufacturing Company mediates a conflict between a design team which wants to use high quality materials and
30:45
the finance team which is concerned about the cost they negotiate by selecting materials that maintain
30:51
quality while staying within the budget it ensures that the product remains both affordable and well made so guys this

product managers we often mean the basic handful of tools that the majority of us use daily these product management tools
32:14
typically consist of software for product analytics development tracking and Road mapping however a product
32:21
manager's duties go beyond simply Gathering product perspicuity surveying the backlog and evaluating the product
32:28
plan whether you are a beginner or an experienced product manager you should utilize the right tool to ensure you are
32:35
not overlooking a crucial aspect of your job product managers are frequently in charge of organizing the examination
32:42
choice and purchase of product Management Solutions for usage inside their company it might be challenging to
32:48
choose the best product management solution though now let's move ahead in our session and know what considerations
32:55
should be taken before choosing tools for product management depending on the requirements of the business each
33:01
product firm will have a unique collection of tools in its accumulation the set of tools that the product team
33:07
employs to manage their operations is known as product management tool accumulation these tools are frequently
33:14
integrated where they perform well together and complement one another the product development efforts May succeed
33:21
or fail greatly depending on the choice of product management tools so to have a
33:26
successful product there should be some considerations to follow up on before choosing a management tool so let's take
33:33
a look at the concerns one must heed before choosing a product management tool the very first consideration that
33:40
should be taken is to recognize the demands of your product management staff making a charter with a list of
33:46
questions for your new product management tool is an intelligent method to assess the requirements of your
33:52
product management team the charter will Aid in outlining particular demands and may be used as a Benchmark for assessing
33:59
items the next consideration that should be considered is to do some product research it's time to research the
34:06
various product possibilities after you have a clearer idea of your demands and criteria for a product reading product
34:13
reviews and seeing product demonstrations are the most significant ways to accomplish this you will have a
34:20
deeper grasp of the features and how each product functions by doing the research for the product moving on we
34:27
have to consider items depending on product needs following your research it's time to analyze the items in light
34:34
of your unique needs start by grading each item according to how effectively it satisfies your needs to rank the
34:42
various items you may add a column to each need to rank the various items this
34:47
stage will enable you to evaluate and contrast several Solutions and decide
34:53
which product management Suite is best for your team the next consider ation is
34:58
to aim to stay within your budget when looking at product Management Solutions budget is always an important
35:05
consideration but if you work for a startup or a smaller firm it's much more crucial keep in mind that some of the
35:12
top Goods could have steep asking prices as well as ongoing costs the simplest
35:17
method to achieve this is to set a predetermined budget for your product tool and use it as a guide when weighing
35:24
various possibilities then we have to make sure that the tool is with effortless use
35:29
make sure the tool you use is simple to use before you buy it although it should be obvious certain Technologies are
35:36
quite complex and need users to undergo many days of training the technology
35:42
that works best for you and your team will be the one that you find simple to use many tools allow you to try them out
35:48
for free so you may decide whether to buy them before you use them the next
35:54
consideration is reporting in real time find a product product tool that offers real-time reporting to save time
36:01
creating reports that reflect the product's current condition will gather data from many parts of the product
36:06
management systems moving on we have a reputable interface although there are a
36:12
lot of tools available some of them appear somewhat dated expandability
36:17
needs to be your main Criterion When selecting a tool opting for something attractive looking doesn't hurt either
36:25
the last consideration that should be taken is security scalability is great but if your data isn't secure neither is
36:32
the Integrity of your product examine the security features that your desired tool supplier offers to keep your client
36:39
data private and isolated from everyone else's choose the different dedicated hosting platform let's proceed in our
36:46
session and know what top tools are used for product management how do you assess
36:51
and determine which tools are best for your team consider your firm and product size and development stage as a starting
36:58
point a tiny firm with one product manager for instance probably won't require or have the funds for numerous
37:05
tools you could pick a few applications that provide a wide range of Integrations and features a huge
37:11
organization on the other hand would require specific tools created for complex workstreams and several
37:18
teams the very first functioning of product management is user tracking and
37:23

2:04:45
Frameworks for measuring growth and success in saas and startup businesses

2:06:28
customers come from activation the process of converting acquired clients into engaged ones retention how to
2:06:35
entice potential clients to return referral techniques for encouraging clients to endorse your offerings
2:06:42
Revenue how to convert prospective clients into paying clients acquisition
2:06:47
in essence you want individuals to register for something for instance you could want someone to register for a
2:06:53
free trial keep up strong traffic acquisition you need to make sure your website is receiving qualified leads the
2:07:00
fact is if you have a good amount of focused visits each month you don't need a ton of leads to obtain clients save
2:07:07
your time establish your Target demographic and conduct a campaign to build anticipation for the launch when

relation ship progresses further down the funnel will depend on those factors the number of people who do a certain
2:07:57
action such as seeking additional information subscribing to a YouTube channel or making a purchase may be used
2:08:04
to assess activation the number of customers or users who have been activated would be divided by the total
2:08:11
number of people that viewed the website or Etc to arrive at a formula that would be helpful at this point
2:08:19
retention retention is a essential to economic success for any organization that wants to endure for a long time
2:08:26
this is because the most significant measure of how much people value your product or service is retention
2:08:32
depending on the pricing range of your goods attracting firsttime buyers or customers may not be challenging because
2:08:39
people make impulsive purchases every day a subsequent purchase or engagement however shows that the customer was
2:08:46
satisfied and that the item or service matched their needs businesses use used many techniques for measuring retention
2:08:53
however such as annual recurring Revenue monthly recurring Revenue customer turn
2:08:59
repeat purchase ratio and time between purchases may be approaches to gauge
2:09:05
client-based retention referral referrals are one of
2:09:10
the last components of the pirate funnel it is crucial to remember that many graphic representations of the funnel
2:09:16
include an arrow called acquisition that Loops up from the bottom back to the top
2:09:21
and this is because a perfect funnel would be a loop or a customer cycle that keeps bringing in new clients while
2:09:27
maintaining existing ones successful referrals may be especially crucial since they are a less expensive method
2:09:34
of acquiring customers than traditional marketing and because of the impact of family and friends they are frequently
2:09:40
predisposed to Brand loyalty if individuals in their Circle are already customers there are no ideal measures
2:09:47
for this statistic however several metrics such as number of active user sharing invites can assist a firm when
2:09:54
they start tracking referrals many times people fail to mention that they were recommended or a user who receives an
2:10:01
invite from a friend may take months or even years to activate nevertheless a
2:10:07
good referral program may be demonstrated by reduced customer attrition sustained growth and overall
2:10:14
program success Revenue although money is transferred earlier in the customer
2:10:19
life cycle Revenue May be unreliable if the proceeding phases aren't completed and measured for this reason revenue is
2:10:27
frequently shown as the last step in the pirate funnel rapid Revenue production is less important for a company's
2:10:34
success than effective marketing and initiatives to keep customers and get them to recommend others the ability to
2:10:41
track income correctly is essential for a business to succeed and while being aware of total revenue after cost is
2:10:48
crucial it only represents a small portion of the full picture to get a full view of a company's success and

2:20:53
parameters for product accomplishment by providing the metrics and data one may obtain a sense of how to position the
2:21:00
product successfully in the market now let's move toward the responsibilities of a product owner both
2:21:08
product owners and managers are involved in the process of developing new products but their responsibilities are
2:21:14
distinct in terms of how they accomplish objectives and where they are located at various stages of the process
2:21:22
the very first responsibility of product owners is engaging stakeholders product owners often
2:21:29
collaborate with internal stakeholders inside the business they oversee important interactions with managers
2:21:35
their departments and the board of directors to develop the goods and provide answers these experts gather
2:21:42
data from various parties to enhance user stories in the backlog a product owner may speak within users directly
2:21:49
When developing a product taking into account the viewpoints of many professionals and customers may help
2:21:55
both roles perform their responsibilities more successfully moving on to the next
2:22:01
responsibility of a product owner is taking care of obligations product owners concentrate
2:22:07
more narrowly on smallscale activities product owners are in charge of a Project's day-to-day operations and
2:22:14
details while product managers focus on the project as a whole to assure product
2:22:19
fulfillment these experts May for example oversee the manufacturing team
2:22:25
create a backlog and work with warehouses the next responsibility of a product owner is analyzing
2:22:32
customers similar research is conducted by product owners to understand the needs and preferences of the target
2:22:39
market but they are also in charge of teaching the whole team about these topics product owners in scrum teams see
2:22:46
to it that all team members incorporate consumer perspectives while creating or
2:22:51
updating these features along with the product manager they also help the backlog be optimized based on client
2:22:58
input and check to see if a product adequately incorporates it moving forward the next responsibility of a
2:23:05
product owner is directing group efforts product owners often collaborate
2:23:10
with teams daily to make sure they correctly follow a plan and meet backlog requirements as a consequence they could
2:23:18
collaborate with product managers to choose the most important features and the most suitable
2:23:24
schedule additionally these experts could let designers know what is expected of them and assist them in
2:23:30
creating mockups or prototypes the next responsibility of a product owner is product backlog
2:23:37
management the product owner must compile the backlog of items and prioritize them following the
2:23:42
overarching strategy and corporate goals the product owner will also need to map
2:23:47
out project dependencies to determine the proper order of development but the product backlog isn't just a list of
2:23:54
things to accomplish it's a dynamic document that has to be updated often in response to changing project
2:24:01
requirements as it develops and the last responsibility of a product owner is observing the stages
2:24:07
of development the product owner should devote a substantial amount of time to managing the actual creation of the
2:24:14
product once the vision strategy and product priorities have been established
2:24:19
they play a significant role in All Phases of the event including planning fine-tuning reviewing and sprinting the
2:24:27
agile product owner collaborates with stakeholders throughout the planning phases to determine and arrange the
2:24:33
tasks necessary for the following iteration after that they will get together with their team to polish the
2:24:39
procedure pinpoint any problems and assist with the Sprint now let's move on
2:24:45
to the skills of both product managers and product owners so let's begin with skill skills required by a product
2:24:52
manager strategic thinking understanding your position in the market concentrating on the goals and seeing
2:24:58
chances can help you plan and build tactics leadership skills the capacity
2:25:04
of a person to inspire and guide a team of others working together to accomplish a common objective and time management
2:25:12
the capacity to effectively manage time so that the product may be delivered in the allotted time empathy skills the
2:25:19
capacity to relate to and comprehend the ideas and feelings of another person
2:25:25
empathy requires placing oneself in the other person's position communication
2:25:30
skills how one interacts with others and the act of imparting knowledge our
2:25:35
ability to communicate effectively allows us to provide information in a way that the audience can comprehend it
2:25:42
presentation skills the capacity to convey in an engaging original and
2:25:47
Visually appealing manner now let's move ahead and know the skills required by product owners design
2:25:55
reasoning to promote product breakthroughs product owners must feel at ease creating hypothesis-driven
2:26:02
development environments analytical skills the management evaluation and approval of
2:26:08
the product backlog should be the top priority for a product owner for this reason they need to be Adept analysts
2:26:15
who can review product problems and upgrades critically and come up with logic remedies rapidly cooperation
2:26:23
abilities product owners who act as Liaisons between scrum teams must be at
2:26:28
ease with continual engagement they should prioritize cooperation and be at ease with delegating dispute resolution
2:26:36
and interacting with people of all temperaments and emotions decisionmaking
2:26:42
another essential ability for product owners is decisionmaking the product owner a senior member of a product
2:26:48
development team makes several choices every day including choosing which items to add to the product backlog how to
2:26:55
rank them and how to inform the team of these decisions resolution of disputes the
2:27:02
resolution of disputes is the capacity to resolve problems using established techniques or developing new ones
2:27:09
because of the many parties engaged in the project disputes may arise often for you as the product owner during the
2:27:16
product development cycle aptitude for learning one of the most crucial
2:27:21
qualities for product owners to have is an aptitude for learning it's crucial to be a breast of the most recent market
2:27:27
trends customer demands and corporate requirements moving on with our session
2:27:33
let's understand the difference between product managers and product owners product managers have a greater
2:27:40
strategic role with broader corporate objectives in mind they Define and map out the product management process
2:27:47
across the product life cycle whereas product owners take on a more proactive
2:27:52
role and prioritize immediate fulfillment by creating customer Stories the team can utiliz to make more
2:27:59
user-led decisions for product development they assist in maximizing the value of the
2:28:05
product they concentrate on the market corporate goals and the product's vision
2:28:11
whereas product owners collaborate with cross functional agile teams to carry out these needs by converting the
2:28:17
product manager strategy into concrete activ activities the why who and what are the
2:28:24
responsibility of the product manager their roles reach might vary greatly or be very constrained based on
2:28:31
a variety of variables on the other hand a product owner scope is often smaller
2:28:36
than a product managers product owners are in charge of the how artifacts like a product road map a
2:28:44
product vision card or a product requirement document are frequently the responsibility of product
2:28:51
managers product backlogs Sprint backlogs and the definition of done are
2:28:56
just a few examples of the artifacts that product owners must create and
2:29:01
manage product managers May oversee the product Discovery procedure enabling
2:29:06
team participation but on the other hand many of the product ceremonies that take
2:29:12
place throughout the product life cycle such as Sprint planning and backlog grooming also include product
2:29:18
owners the product manager is very knowledgeable about consumer goals and how to ease their problems and the
2:29:25
development team's customer expert is the product owner the multi-disciplinary
2:29:30
product team is led by the product manager they are ultimately in charge of achieving business and product
2:29:37
objectives and also report progress to Executives whereas the implementation
2:29:42
activities are overseen by the product owner on the development team to decide which features the development team will
2:29:48
focus on next they collaborate closely with the product manager and other product team
2:29:55
members based on client feedback the product manager fine-tunes and modifies
2:30:00
the product strategy and vision but product owners make sure that consumers opinions are considered when choices
2:30:07
about various products are made within the company long-term customer support and
2:30:13
continuous product capabilities are priorities for product managers whereas product Sprints and Rel
2:30:20
relases continue to get product owners short to midterm attention plans and important business
2:30:27
results are the responsibility of the product manager delivering value to the end users is the responsibility of the
2:30:34
product owners product managers must communicate with the product teams even if they are
2:30:40
customer facing they must work on wireframes and prototypes and attend scrum sessions this is because it's up
2:30:47
to PMS to determine the overarching video making it crucial to collaborate closely
2:30:52
with the product teams and product owners need to comprehend and sympathize with client
2:30:59
needs if they don't have this every product they develop will continue to overlook different client pain
2:31:06
issues now the next phase is knowing the switch in the roles of a product manager
2:31:11
and product owner so the first question that arises is can a product manager be a product
2:31:18
owner a product manager's role encompasses endtoend product management including
2:31:24
feature functionality product Road mapping and reacting to customer input in addition to product development and
2:31:31
scrum a product manager can also be a product owner because they have a common
2:31:36
objective while the two jobs have the same goal of recognizing client needs and turning those needs into
2:31:43
technological requirements their respective Scopes and objectives differ leaders must thus decide which of these
2:31:50
product Specialists their company requires and in same ways the next
2:31:55
question is can a product owner be a product manager so the answer is a
2:32:02
product manager and owner can be the same individual there are undoubtedly many duties and objectives that overlap
2:32:09
with both jobs but because of this it makes it logical that many businesses utilize a single person to meet the
2:32:16
requirements of both positions and use the scrum product owner as an agile product manager as Roman Pilcher points
2:32:23
out but the thing that comes next in our mind is does an organization need both
2:32:30
roles instead of the titles that will be used the true question regarding what a
2:32:35
firm requires must start with what the desired product outcome is prioritizing
2:32:41
business value comes first followed by evaluating the responsibilities and procedures of the product management
2:32:47
team to support those objectives a business system that lacks flexibility
2:32:52
frequently has structures and processes built into it a review of current work
2:32:57
assignments obstacles to be overcome the overall decision-making process and the
2:33:02
desired outcome are all necessary a better understanding of the business's
2:33:07
operations will exist once all of these issues have been evaluated solved and
2:33:13
prioritized you'll be able to identify any issues delays or subpar product
2:33:18
management you could discover that there are new ways in which you can acclimate to the
2:33:24
product management framework it is possible to combine product ownership and management with other tasks such as
2:33:31
product marketing now coming to the end of our session let's discuss the salary of product manager and product owners
2:33:38
the average salary of a product manager in India is 10 locks perom and in the US
2:33:45
is 90,000 to $160,000 us perom

2:44:09
users are the team turn things around suddenly the product wasn't just liked it was loved here's the kicker studies
2:44:17

2:46:20

2:46:28
lifestyle with a keen interest in outdoor activities like running and hiking and Value Health Community and

2:48:41
point is enhance user experience with insights into the persona's preferences and behaviors ux designers can create
2:48:48
more more intuitive interfaces and interactions that enhance satisfaction and usability and then the point is
2:48:54
guide product customization and Innovation understanding the evolving needs of your personas can lead to
2:48:59
Innovations or customizations that keep your product or service competitive and aligned with user expectations and then
2:49:06
we have supports decision making when faced with decisions about feature inclusion design changes on Market
2:49:12
positioning user personas provide a preference point that reflects the users based Collective needs needs and desires
2:49:19
so these are the role of user personas and the creation and utilization of user personas are foundational elements in
2:49:26
crafting products and experiences that truly meet and exceed user expectations
2:49:31
driving satisfaction loyalty and ultimately business success now we'll see the process of creating user
2:49:37
personas so creating user Persona is a structured process that combines research analysis and creative synthesis
2:49:44
the goal is to generate actionable insights that guide product development design and marketing strategies so we'll
2:49:50
have an overview of the steps involved in creating effective user personas so the number one step is conduct research
2:49:57
start by gathering data about your potential or existing users this can include qualitative methods like
2:50:02
interviews focus groups and and through graphic observation as well as quantitative methods such as surveys and
2:50:09
Analysis of user Behavior data from analytics platforms so let's understand this with an example so let's consider a
2:50:16
scenario the development team for the ecostate app starts by collecting data they conduct online service targeting
2:50:23
Travelers interested in sustainable living they also analyze Forum discussion on ecotourism websites and
2:50:30
interview frequent travelers to understand their preferences and concerns so the next step or the process
2:50:36
would be analyze the data look for patterns and commonalities in the data collected this might involve segmenting
2:50:43
users based on demographics behaviors preferences or goals the aim is to ident identify meaningful groups of users who
2:50:50
share specific characteristics or needs and the findings we have from here is from the research the team notices like
2:50:58
we are again back to the example so from the research that was done that was the conducting the research so the team
2:51:04
notices patterns many respondents prioritize sustainability but also Express concerns about cost and the
2:51:11
authenticity of eco-friendly claims they identify three main segments budget Eco Travelers luxury Eco tour B and Ecco
2:51:20
conscious families so these were the findings analyzing the data and then we
2:51:25
have create draft personas The Next Step So based on your analysis start drafting your personas each Persona should
2:51:31
represent a significant segment of your audience include demographic details behaviors needs goals challenges and any
2:51:39
other relevant information that defines the Persona so you would start drafting the Persona that could be for the budget
2:51:45
Eco traveler and any name be then you can have her age occupation goals what
2:51:51
challenges she is facing and then the next step that would be refine and validate personas Define your personas
2:51:59
by getting feedback from stakeholders and comparing the personas against actual user data when available so this
2:52:06
step may involve revisiting your research to fill in gaps or clarify aspects of the personas and for example
2:52:13
the team that was the app team that shares bests Persona with ecotourism experts and real Travelers fitting B
2:52:21
profile for feedback adjustments are made based on suggestions such as emphasizing the importance of community
2:52:26
reviews in BET's decision making process so this was about the refine and validate personas now moveing to the
2:52:32
next step that is develop scenarios and goals for each Persona outline key scenario or task they need to accomplish
2:52:39
with your product or service this helps in understanding the context in which your personas will interact with your
2:52:45
offerings so let's consider scenario with an example only so Beth for which the Persona was created so Beth is
2:52:51
planning a two we backpacking trip across Costa Rica so she uses ecostay
2:52:57
that app persons was making so she uses ecostay to find budget friendly verified
2:53:03
EES and hosts so key features she looks for include sustainability certifications user reviews and easy
2:53:10
booking options so this was about her so now moving to the next step that is
2:53:16
apply personas so use the Persona to guide decision making in product development design and content strategy
2:53:22
and marketing personal should inform features user interface design and the
2:53:27
overall user experience as well as targeting and messaging and marketing campaign and we talk about the example
2:53:33
so the ecostay app so that development focuses on features like a verification batch for accommodations with authentic
2:53:39
Eco certifications a budget filter with a sustainability rating and a community
2:53:45
review section so this was about apply persona now moving to the next one or
2:53:50
the marketing campaign highlight stories from budget Travelers like B showcasing the app's ability to combine
2:53:56
affordability with sustainability now moving to the next that is review and itate so user Persona should not be
2:54:03
static as your product evolves and you gather more data about your user revisit
2:54:09
and update your persona to ensure they remain accurate and relevant and about the iteration so after the apps launch
2:54:15
user feedback and usage data I analyzed the team finds that Eco conscious
2:54:21
families are also using features designed for Budget Travelers so the personas are updated to reflect their
2:54:27
crossover leading to the development of family friendly features and content so throughout this process it's a crucial
2:54:34
to remember that personas are tools for empathy and understanding designed to keep the user at the heart of product
2:54:40
development decisions while the exact details and depth of each Persona can vary depending on people's scope and the
2:54:47
available data the fundamental goal Remains the Same to create a product that resonates with and meets the needs
2:54:53
of your target users so now moving to the next topic that is applying Persona to product development and marketing
2:54:59
certainly applying user personas effectively streamline both product development and marketing ensuring
2:55:05
efforts are closely aligned with user needs so now we'll see a condensed overview so starting with the product
2:55:10
development number one point would be feature Focus use personas to pinpoint essential features that truly matter to
2:55:17
your target users enhancing the products value and then design decision tailor Design Elements to match the preferences
2:55:24
and Tech proficiency of a Persona improving usability and user satisfaction and then we have
2:55:30
personalized experience leverage insights from personas to customize user experience meeting diverse needs within
2:55:36
your user base now coming to the marketing team so the points are tailored messaging craft messages that
2:55:44
resonate deeply with each Persona addressing their specific interest and pain point for more effective
2:55:49
communication and then we have content strategy developed content that speaks directly to the concerns and goals of a
2:55:55
personas ensuring greater engagement then we have channel selection choose marketing channels based on your persona
2:56:02
preferences optimizing reach and impact so let's see a simplified application example for a fitness app aimed at users
2:56:09
like Fitness funa the development team might focus on personalized workout plans and social sharing features while
2:56:17
marketing efforts would highlight success stories and tips for busy Lifestyles directly catering to Fiona's
2:56:24
interest and needs so by focusing on these streamline points both product development and marketing can more
2:56:30
effectively align with user expectations driving engagement and satisfaction so
2:56:36
this was about the process of creating user personas and now mov to the real world success stories so real world
2:56:42
success stories serve as powerful illustrations of the tangible impact user personas can have on product
2:56:48
development and marketing strategies so we'll see two examples showcasing how companies have leveraged personas to
2:56:54
achieving significant results so the number one example would be spotify's personalized recommendation so the
2:57:02
challenge Spotify faced was Spotify s to enhance user engagement by delivering personalized music recommendations
2:57:09
tailored to individual taste and preferences and the solution they got was by analyzing user data and behavior
2:57:15

2:57:22
preferences these personas informed the development of algorithms that power personalized playlist such as discover
2:57:28

2:58:01

3:03:41
minimal viable product or MVP is a strategy used in product development where a new product is launched with
3:03:47
basic features enough to attract consumer attention it's the simplest version of the product a company aims to
3:03:53
bring to the market whether it's a car website TV or laptop by offering the basic version companies can gather
3:04:00
feedback from the potential user to improve the final product before its full release an MVP typically includes
3:04:07
three key elements firstly it offers enough features for consumers to consider purchasing it making it easier
3:04:13
for the company to Market secondly it includes a feedback mechanism allowing users to to provide input on the product
3:04:19
lastly it provides future benefits to early adopters encouraging them to try out the product ahead of others some of
3:04:26
the fine examples of MVP is Amazon Believe It or Not Amazon began by
3:04:31
selling used college textbooks their first version of the product was basic website for delivering books to students
3:04:38
As Time passed they grew their business to become the huge online store we see today similarly another fine example is
3:04:45
arbnb arbnb Journey began with a bold idea renting out air mattresses Yes you
3:04:51
heard it right they kicked off with a simple website connecting Travelers with host offering makeshift accommodations
3:04:57
this quirky start was their MVP that is minimal viable product slowly but surely
3:05:02
they listen to user feedback fine-tuned their problem and expanded their Horizons it's a tale of humble
3:05:08
beginnings turned into a global phenomena who knew an air mattress could spark a revolution in travel and there
3:05:14
are many more examples like that but implementing the minimal VI product approach requires more than just having
3:05:19
an idea doing the basics and launching it it involves strategic planning to ensure its Effectiveness and value now
3:05:25
let's understand the benefits that companies get from MVPs creating a minimal viable product can assist you in
3:05:32
avoiding many potential mistakes that you might Overlook when deeply passionate about your product understand
3:05:37
the preferences of your target audience when a company builds a minimal viable product they make a basic version of
3:05:44
their product to see what people like by doing this they can learn what features
3:05:49
or things their consumers prefer it's like trying out different flavors of ice cream to see which one people like the
3:05:55
most helps create a better product yes making an MVP lets companies test their
3:06:00
ideas quickly and see what works and what does not this helps them make improvements and build a better final
3:06:07
product it's similar to making a rough sketch of a drawing before making the final detail version next is it helps to
3:06:13
analyze the demand with an MVP companies can see how many people are in interested in their product if lotss of
3:06:19
people like it they know there's a big demand if not many people are interested they might need to change their plans
3:06:25
it's a bit like testing the waters to see if people want what you're offering next is ensures quick release instead of
3:06:32
spending a long time making a perfect product an MVP lets companies release something quickly this means they can
3:06:38
start getting feedback and making Improvement sooner it's like serving a simple version of a dish at a restaurant
3:06:44
first and then making it fancier based on the the customer say so this was about the benefits now let's talk about
3:06:51
how to develop a minimal viable product so first is understand your goals before
3:06:56
starting to develop your minimal viable product it's important to know what you want to achieve think about what problem
3:07:02
your product will solve or what benefit it will provide to the people understanding your goals helps you stay
3:07:07
focused and build a product that meets your objectives the next is study your Market take some time to reach and
3:07:14
understand the market where your product will compete look at look at similar products already available and see what
3:07:20
makes them successful or what could be improved by studying the market you can identify opportunities and challenges
3:07:26
helping you tailor your MVP to better meet the needs of your target audience next is consider the product features
3:07:33
think about essential features your product needs to have in order to address the problem or provide the benefit you identifi keep the features
3:07:39
simple focused on solving the core problem or delivering the main benefit avoid adding too many features at this
3:07:45
stage as the goal of an MVP is to create something basic that you can test and iterate upon based on the user feedback
3:07:52
the next is gather feedback early and often once you have developed your MVP don't wait too long before sharing it
3:07:58
with the potential customers gather feedback as early as possible by letting people try out your product and asking
3:08:04
for their thoughts this feedback will help you understand the aspects of your MVP and of working well what areas need
3:08:11
Improvement allowing you to make adjustments and iterate quickly the next is iterate based on feedback use the
3:08:17
feedback you receive to make improvements to your MVP this might involve adding new features refining
3:08:22
existing ones or even pivoting in a different direction based on what you learn from the users the key is to be
3:08:29
flexible and open to making changes based on the feedback you receive as this will help you create a better final
3:08:35
product that meets the needs of your target audience by following these steps you can develop a minimal viable product
3:08:41
that efficiently addresses a specific problem or need in the market while also allowing you to gather valuable feedback
3:08:48
and I trade towards a more refined and more successful product over time today we will talk about something super

3:10:59
walking skeleton method Etc also choosing the right prioritization technique well prioritization technique
3:11:06
is a method used to determine the order of importance of task activities or elements within a project or process it
3:11:14
helps to identify what needs to be done first what can wait and what may not need to
3:11:20
be done at all this technique involves assessing the relative significance urgency or impact of different items and
3:11:28
arranging them in logical sequence or order of importance by prioritizing effectively you can allocate resources
3:11:36
time and effort more efficiently ensuring that you address the most crucial aspects first to achieve your
3:11:43
goals effectively but why is prioritizing so important let's discuss the importance
3:11:50
of prioritization prioritization is crucial for several reasons at first we
3:11:56
have limited resources every team has limited resources whether time budget or
3:12:02
Manpower granitization helps you make most of these Resources by focusing on
3:12:07
the most important features first then we have customer satisfaction by delivering the most valuable features
3:12:14
first you can keep your customers happy and engaged with your product moving on
3:12:20
to competitive advantage in today's fast-paced market prioritization can give you a Competitive Edge by allowing
3:12:27
you to quickly adapt to changing customer needs and market trends now that we have understood the importance
3:12:33
of prioritization let's dive into some of the most popular prioritization techniques the seven most popular
3:12:40
prioritization techniques we will discuss today are as follows at first we have mosco method moving on to Cano
3:12:47
model rice scoring model icenhower Matrix value versus complexity Matrix
3:12:53
weighted short as job first and then at last we have the walking skeleton method let us start with the first method which
3:13:00
is the mosco method mosco is a simple way to prioritize task and features when
3:13:06
working on a project it stands for must should could and W let me break it down
3:13:11
for you must these are the essential features that absolutely have to be included if you if you do not have these
3:13:18
the project will fail then should these are the important features that you
3:13:23
should try to include but they are not critical they would be great to have if
3:13:29
possible that's it then we have good These are nice to have smaller improvements or additions and leaving
3:13:36
them out want really impact the project want these are the lowest prity items
3:13:42
that don't match the current needs or goals you can safely leave these out for now
3:13:47
by separating everything into these four buckets you can get super clear as a
3:13:52
team on the true priorities and make sure you're laser focused on checking those must have boxes first so what are
3:14:00
the pros and cons of this method well first off it's dead simple no complex
3:14:06
calculation or scoring systems are needed you can prioritize a massive backlog just by rapidly categorizing
3:14:13
each them it's also flexible since there are no strict rules or time within each bucket if a should item needs to be
3:14:20
deprioritized no problem just move it to the cloud or want as needed and finally
3:14:26
the clear separation into these Universal terms helps get everyone developers designers product managers
3:14:33
and stakeholders on the same page instantly when it comes to understanding priorities of course there are some
3:14:40
downsides too while it's easy to categorize mosco doesn't give you specific implementation plan or sequence
3:14:46
to follow follow you have to figure that part out separately you can also lack
3:14:51
some bigger pictures perspective by just focusing on individual feature priorities you might miss out the
3:14:57
Strategic product goals or overarching business objectives and sometimes those
3:15:02
category lines can get you a little blurry in a certain feature a must have or a should reasonable people may
3:15:10
disagree but in all mosco is a simple yet powerful prioritization technique
3:15:15
especially for smaller projects or titos Scopes where you need priorities locked in quickly for bigger more complex
3:15:22
undertakings it can't be your only prioritization method you likely want to pair it up with something more robust
3:15:29
let me give you an example of a product for example a mobile app for buying crypto the must would include the
3:15:36
ability to buy and sell coins maintain a portfolio View and set up payment methods those are the essential
3:15:43
no-brainer priorities shs could be things like advanced analysis alerts
3:15:48
price tracking and maybe even integrated social trading features they're really
3:15:53
valuable but not required for an MVP quid might include custom valuable
3:15:59
additions might include captivating video intros or integrated video calling
3:16:04
features unnecessary additions could be custom M themes features user might
3:16:09
dislike include intrusive ads or sneaky premium upsells by prioritizing based on
3:16:15
this model you can perfect the essential experience before focusing on extra features themes or watch list but
3:16:21
doesn't break the core experience and once for a initial launch could be things like Advanced Tax tools purchase
3:16:28
of other asset classes or automating trades with Bots just not crucial priorities for the first version by
3:16:35
categorizing your backlog into mosow you can clearly see that you need to prioritize those three musthave items
3:16:42
above everything else to have a chance at a successful initial launch the rest can be prioritized separately within
3:16:49
their respective buckets so that's more going a nutshell a simple flexible way to rapidly categorize your priorities at
3:16:56
a very first step next we have the Cano model this one is all about making sure
3:17:02
that we are delivering what our users want and care about it splits features into a few buckets must have
3:17:09
one-dimensional attractive total time wasters and stuff that's all it splits
3:17:14
features into few buckets must have onedimensional attractive total time wasters and stuff to use it we survey
3:17:22
our potential users and get them to categorize each feature based on how it impacts their satisfaction the must have
3:17:29
are things that absolutely need for the product to work at all onedimensional features are nice to have that will
3:17:35
please them if you get them but disappoint if you don't attractive features are awesome bonus points that
3:17:41
Delight users but it's no big deal if they are missing indifferent stuff doesn't really matter either way and
3:17:48
reverse features are things users actively hate having the pros are that
3:17:53
it really highlights what matters most to customers and ranks features by their
3:17:58
priorities the downsides is that it ignores how difficult these features are to get built it's also timec consuming
3:18:06
to get that user feedback in the first place this is all for the pros and cons but when does it make sense to use Cano
3:18:14
well it's great for Branding new products to get an initial reality check before you start designing off for
3:18:20
validating prototypes and making sure you're on the right track let me now give you an example say like you're
3:18:25
building a dating app the must have might be the ability to create profile browse potential matches and message
3:18:32
people onedimensional could be stuff like Advanced filtering super likes Etc
3:18:37
valuable additions might include captivating video intros or integrated video calling features unnecessary
3:18:44
additions could be custom app themes featur user my dislike include intrusive ads or premium upsells by prioritizing
3:18:52
based on this model you can ensure you perfect the essential experience before focusing on extra features next we got
3:18:59
the rice model which is little more number driven it scores each feature by
3:19:04
looking at four factors the reach or number of users who will use it the
3:19:10
impact it have your confidence in its success and the Manpower effort required
3:19:15
to build it you create each factor like impact which could be massive high medium low or minimal then you plug
3:19:23
those ratings into a formula to get a rise score higher scores means higher priorities it scores each feature by
3:19:30
looking at four factors the reach or number of users who use it the impact it will have your confidence in its success
3:19:37
and the Manpower efforts required to build it you grade each factor like impact which could be massive high
3:19:43
medium low or minimal then you plug the ratings into a formula to get a rice
3:19:49
score higher scores means higher priorities the pros of rice are that
3:19:54
it's comprehensive accounting for user value technical cost risk and all that
3:19:59
good stuff and it uses real metrics instead of just gut feelings the conss
3:20:05
are that it can be calculation heavy for every single feature and you might be missing some of the data points for
3:20:11
brand new products now why does it make sense to use rice it's awesome for established products with good product
3:20:18
metrics and usage data to draw them probably not the best approach for totally fresh projects without any of
3:20:26
those numbers yet let's look at an example of a yoga studio app for a new
3:20:31
class booking feature reach could be around 25,000 monthly active users
3:20:36
impact could be massive like uh three on the scale confidence in its success is
3:20:42
medium to high so maybe considering it to 80% and the engineering effort is
3:20:47
estimated around 3 person months plugging into that formula the rise scores come outs to be 25,000 into three
3:20:55
multiplying by 0.8 which is around 20,000 you can then compare that against
3:21:00
this SC for other potential features and prioritize accordingly moving on to the
3:21:06
next model which is the ishar Matrix we don't have any complicated formulas here just simply divide your task into four
3:21:12
buckets based on whether they are Urgent important both or need either the Urgent and important stuff goes into the top
3:21:19
priority bucket to be tackled immediately important not urgent task go in the scheduled bucket for later urgent
3:21:27
but unimportant fire drills get isolated in their quadrant so you can properly
3:21:32
manage those and then at the last area is for the total time wasters neither
3:21:37
urgent nor important the pros of this method are it's very simple to use and
3:21:43
that it keeps you focused on the truly important task that drive business value the downside is that it's quite
3:21:50
subjective and qualitative no hard numbers or scoring system is involved
3:21:55
you might be wondering why should we use the eisenh har Matrix when it works great as a personal time management
3:22:02
framewor or as a first pass for broadly prioritizing a bunch of task but most
3:22:08
likely we want to complement it with some other techniques for a more rigorous product
3:22:13
prioritization let's look at an example of a brand and new e-commerce business
3:22:18
the Urgent and important stuff is setting up the payments and shipping Integrations would be a top priority
3:22:25
important but not urgently needed task are implementing product filters or recommendations would go in the schedu
3:22:32
it section redesigning the logo just cause would be urgent but unimportant busy work adding multi- language support
3:22:40
way down the line would be the lowest priority section since it's neither urgent nor crucial for the launch next
3:22:46
next we've got the value versus complexity Matrix this one is similar to The ashar Matrix as it works with the
3:22:52
quadrants and dimensions but instead of urgent and important it access value and
3:22:58
complexity with this one we map out each feature based on its expected user or
3:23:03
business value on one axis and the implementation complexity or engineering effort level on the other we can use
3:23:10
whatever scoring or definitions make sense but the goal is to prioritize these high value low complex items first
3:23:17
since they're easy wins really valuable but High complex stuff comes next after
3:23:23
that is the low value low complexity stuff we have the pros are that it balances business user demands with
3:23:30
what's feasible to build looking at the value and effort and then we can tweak the scoring criteria according to our
3:23:36
needs the conss are that it can still be pretty subjective and may not be ideal for massive code bases and products but
3:23:44
when does value versus complexity work well it's perfect for smaller teams and products early in the life cycle when
3:23:50
you need to rootless prioritize not the greatest for large complex established products with crazy requirements let me
3:23:57
give you an example of a productivity app a high value low complexity features
3:24:03
might be the coree ability to create an assigned task super useful and not too
3:24:08
hard to build a high value High complexity one could be integrated with all other major productivity tools low
3:24:15
value High comp lexity might be some insane reporting dashboard with a zillion visualizations and the low value
3:24:22
low complexity stuff could be like smaller tweaks custom emoji support Etc
3:24:27
by mapping those out you can prioritize the top left quadrant of a major value ads with minimal effort first all right
3:24:34
we are getting into some of the heavy weights weight is shortest job first or
3:24:40
wsjf it uses some heavy duty calculations but for a good reason for
3:24:45
each feature you estimate the cost delay and how much you're losing by not having
3:24:50
that feature then you look at the job durations or how long it will take to implement you score the cost of delay
3:24:57
based on factors like user business value how time sensitive it is whether it reduces risk and so on higher scores
3:25:05
means higher cost of delays then you divide the cost of delay by the job duration to get wsjf score for each
3:25:12
feature the pros of wsjf are that it's detailed consistent calculation approach
3:25:19
and it optimizes for faster Roi with limited resources the cons are that it
3:25:24
gets calculation heavy quickly and may unintentionally deprioritize bigger long-term projects use wsjf when you
3:25:32
need to double down on those minimum marketable features and quick high impact wins don't rely on it too much
3:25:39
for full-blown product road maps though let me show you an example adding an
3:25:44
offline mod to the notes app take a look at the cost of delay factors the user business value is high maybe four out of
3:25:51
five since it's frequently requested feature the time criticality is also High 5x5 since it's the pain point for
3:25:59
the users and it reduces the risk of potential data loss so say 4x5 for risk
3:26:05
reduction adding those up the total cost of delay is 30 if we calculate the job
3:26:10
duration to be around 2 months then the wsgf score comes out to be 13 divided by
3:26:16
2 which is 6.5 you would calculate scores that way out for potential features too then prioritize the ones
3:26:23
with the highest scores like offline mode first last but not the least we've got the walking skeleton method this one
3:26:30
is all about identifying and prioritizing only the bare minimum core features needed to ship an initial MVP
3:26:37
which means minimum viable product that basic walking version of your product
3:26:43
the idea is to map out the skeletal requirements that are critical for the product to function and show its core
3:26:49
value proposition to users the pros are that it enables fast prioritization and
3:26:54
MVP delivery we can get the market quickly test our scores idea user
3:27:00
feedback and iterate rapidly from there instead of over engineering and over
3:27:05
stuff version the cons are that it will be shipping a pretty basic product initially by cutting out tons of extra
3:27:12
features and there's a risk of taking it too far and crippling the product if not careful use the walking skeleton method
3:27:19
when we are focused on delivering an MVP as soon as humanly possible to validate your idea and get moving don't use it as
3:27:27
your sole prioritization technique for full product road maps though let me give you an example of a brand new video
3:27:33
streaming service using the walking skeleton approach the top priorities would be ability to browse a video
3:27:39
catalog playing those videos back smoothly user login and subscription functionality does the code skeleton
3:27:47
everything else like recommendation watch list parental controls would all be delayed for future iterations after
3:27:53
getting the MVP out by hyper focusing only on these critical first few steps
3:27:58
we can take an entirely new product from concept to Market fast while still shipping a functional experience to
3:28:05
start generating feedback and data let us now discuss how to choose the right prioritization technique when
3:28:11
considering the prioritization method keep in mind the following criteria simp Simplicity the simpler the method the
3:28:18
faster you can prioritize datadriven prioritization some methods rely more on
3:28:23
assumptions While others are based on proven data balance between technology constants and business value some
3:28:30
methods focus more on customer value While others consider technical complexity best use case prioritizing
3:28:36
for an MVP might require different techniques than prioritizing for a mature product remember these methods
3:28:43
are not mutually exclusive and you can combine them at different stages of your product development life cycle so there
3:28:50
you have it a full breakdown of different prioritization techniques from the statistical model to the dead simple
3:28:56
mattresses each one has its own pros and cons and certain methods will make it more sense than others depending on your
3:29:03
project stage complexity and data availability do you remember when the first iPhone came out in 2007 it was a
3:29:11
game Cher but if you try to use the same iPhone today you might feel out ated
3:29:17
that's because technology moves fast and customer demands keep evolving so Tech giants like apple must keep innovating
3:29:24
and investing heavily in research and development to stay ahead keeping track
3:29:30
of the entire process from ideon to product launch is a massive task
3:29:35
especially for companies dealing with complex manufacturing and global distribution this is where the product
3:29:41
life cycle management PLM comes in before product life cycle management company companies had a really tough
3:29:47
time different teams didn't always talk to each other and it was hard to keep track of all the information about a
3:29:54
product causing problems like delays and products that didn't quite hit the mark Apple saw this and knew they needed a
3:30:01
better way to manage their products from start to finish so they came up with PLM
3:30:07
strategies that is product life cycle management strategies and special computer programs to help everyone work
3:30:14
together better with product life cycle management everyone involved in making and selling the product could share
3:30:20
information and work together very smoothly so this was how Apple keeps launching new Innovative products like
3:30:27
the latest iPhone or the Apple watch while phasing out the older models so if you have ever wondered how companies
3:30:34
like apple keeps delivering such cuttingedge products it's all about managing the entire life cycle
3:30:41
effectively in this video we will explore what PLM is that is product life cycle management the various phases and
3:30:48
steps involved its benefit through a simple example let us now understand what is product life cycle management
3:30:55
product life cycle management is like the blueprint that guides companies through the entire journey of a product
3:31:01
from its birth to its retirement take for instance the evolution of smartphones in the development stage
3:31:07
companies like Apple or Samsung spends month designing and perfecting the new phones deciding on features like camera
3:31:14
quality battery life and screen size once the design is locked in they move on to the introduction stage where the
3:31:21
new phone is launched with much fanfare and marketing Buzz as people start buying the new phone it enters into the
3:31:27
growth stage sales Skyrocket and the company may even release updated versions with a better features like
3:31:34
enhanced cameras or faster processors to keep up with the demand and stay ahead of the competition but eventually every
3:31:41
phone reaches to the maturity stage competitors catch up and sales starts to level off that's when companies might
3:31:48
offer discounts or bundle deals to keep customers interested but inevitably sales begin to decline as newer models
3:31:54
hit the mark and that's where the PLM shines throughout the entire process it helps companies to make critical
3:32:01
decisions like when to release updates how much inventory to keep and when to discontinue the product all together by
3:32:07
effectively managing the product life cycle companies can stay agile maximize profit and always offer their customers
3:32:14
the best products now that we have discussed what product life cycle management is we will now understand the
3:32:20
different phases of product development when it comes to products we go through a journey from just being an idea to
3:32:26
becoming real tangible thing that customers can buy and use this journey is what we call the product life cycle
3:32:33
and it has several phases let's use the example of a new smartphone to illustrate these phases it all starts
3:32:39
with the concept and design phase this is where the magic happens the initial ideon research on what customer is want
3:32:46
studying competitive products and defining the smartphone's core features and requirements once the concept is
3:32:52
locked in we move on to the development phase here the detailed designs and prototypes are created tested and
3:32:58
refined based on the real world feedback imagine Engineers tinkering with different models running all sorts of
3:33:04
validation tests and making sure the smartphone is ready for the prime time with all that hardwork done it's time
3:33:10
for the production and the launch phase this is where the final Market ready version of the smartphone is produced
3:33:17
and rolled out to the stores and online outlets for customers to get their hands on it but the journey doesn't end here
3:33:23
after launch comes in the service and support phase where the company provides assistance updates and resources to help
3:33:30
customers get the most out of their new smartphone purchases eventually even the best product reach out to the end of
3:33:37
their Road that's when the retirement phase where the company figures out the best way to phase out an aging product
3:33:43
maybe offer incentives for upgrades and potentially recycle or repurpose
3:33:48
components for future Innovations so there you have it the five key phases
3:33:53
that product typically go through in the product life cycle management let me walk you through the stages of product
3:33:59
life cycle management every product goes through different stages during the lifetime known as the product life cycle
3:34:06
this cycle starts when the product hits the mark after development and ends when it's taken off the shelves or
3:34:12
discontinued learning the product life cycle management can help improve your chances of success in product management
3:34:18
while it's just a model and not perfect it provides a useful approximation to understand the stages what a product
3:34:25
goes through the four main stages are introduction growth maturity decline we
3:34:30
will now learn about the different stages in detail so let's talk about the stage one which is Introduction in this
3:34:37
stage a new product is launched into the market after development companies typically spend a lot on promotional
3:34:43
efforts like advertising and getting the product onto shelves and in front of the customers example when Apple launches a
3:34:50
new iPhone model they heavily market and advertise it across the channel they also work to get it stocked at mobile
3:34:57
carriers and retail stores worldwide for the release date this is usually little to no profit made at the stage as the
3:35:04
cost of the launch are so high the first buyers tend to be innovators and the early adopters excited to try the new
3:35:10
offering despite potential issues let us now talk about the stage two which is the growth stage in this stage the
3:35:17
product moves to the growth stage where the consumer demands accelerates the primary objectives are to rapidly gain
3:35:24
as much as market share as possible and bring aboard new customer segments your focus shifts to aggressive marketing
3:35:31
promotions and added product features and models to appeal to different customer groups for example Apple
3:35:37
markets the new iPhone to different audiences like professionals Gamers photographers Etc they add new color
3:35:44
options and storage capacities to give buyers more choices retail channels and
3:35:50
online ordering systems have to handle the huge surge in demand it's critical to capture



-----------



on the screen, they are now among the world's most valuable companies and many
2:14
of these companies have able to get this kind of amazing transition just after
2:21
2022. So from 2022 to 2023,
2:26
this company Open AI has got a valuation of 500 billion. This anthropic company
2:33
which was not existing few years ago now has a valuation of $183 billion and then we have something called as XAI Elon MRI
2:41
which has the valuation of $200 billion. Not only the new companies are doing
2:46
well but the older companies which are betting on AI as a revolution which is
2:52
Microsoft has gone from so Microsoft was founded in
2:59
Yes. Microsoft was founded in about 1980s 1983 and from
3:06
then to 2021 they were able to get a market cap of 1.8 trillion but in the
3:12
last 3 years they have grown from 18.8 to 3.8 almost twice increase. Similarly
3:18
Google after betting on AI they have grown their valuation almost 2.5x similarly meta has grown too much from
3:26
0.3 billion or 300 billion to 1.8 8 trillion and then Nvidia which is the
3:31
most which is the company which has most benefited from this AI revolution it has
3:37
gone almost 10x of their valuation right and then we have also seen some very new
3:42
age companies which are actually created in this period only so ker the company did not existed few years ago is now
3:49
worth $9 billion glean is worth $7 billion 11 labs is worth $6 billion and
3:55
perplexity is is worth $15 billion So now there is a sharp change that has
4:02
happened in the market recently because of which people are able to understand that there is this new technology called
4:08
Genai which can go ahead and do so many things together. Okay, but understand as
4:14
many people have predicted this can well be a bubble. So how do you check if something is a bubble or not? It might be possible that all of these companies
4:21
are overvalued in some of the other way. But let me ask you a very honest question. Okay, everyone go ahead and
4:28
answer me in the chat. When was the last time that you have used chat GP and Gemini?
4:42
Yeah, I'm sure for many of you your one of the tab is chat GP right now.
4:58
Yes. Cool. Right. So, understand there have been
5:04
many technologies that have came and gone. For example, there was a
5:10
uh there was a revolution on blockchain, there was a revolution on cryptocurrency, there was a revolution
5:15
on NFTs. Although you were listening about all of these things on news on
5:20
multiple websites and Twitter but they could not become a part of your daily life right so the verdict is that it
5:29
might be possible that these things that we are talking about the valuation and all these could be larger than life
5:34
valuation that is completely possible I'm not disagreeing with that but we also have to understand that genai is a
5:40
technology that has been able to prove itself that it is actually very helpful
5:46
Because technology if it is only increasing the valuation that might mean that yes it could be a bubble but if it
5:53
is generally helping you in your daily life then it just means that it is just a matter of time that we are able to
5:58
find its relevant use cases and utilize it for work and more of our personal life right but how has it happened like
6:06
what is there in the genai revolution so understand the genai revolution has happened because of a innovation in
Understanding Large Language Models
6:13
technology which is called as large language model. Okay. So what is a large
6:18
language model? A large language model? A large language model is a neural
6:24
network trained on massive amounts of text to learn patterns in language enabling it to understand, generate and
6:30
reason with natural language by predicting the next more likely most likely word or token in the context.
6:37
Right? This is the Wikipedia definition of large language models. But what exactly is a large language model? Let
6:43
me go ahead and tell you. Please everyone focus on the session super important part.
6:48
Yes. So we are talking about
6:54
large language model.
7:00
So a large language model is it is kind of a code
7:06
or an algorithm. It is kind of a code or algorithm or a
7:11
piece of technology that is very good at predicting the next word in the sequence. That is get very
7:19
good in predicting the next word of the sequence.
7:25
Right? For example, I just take this sentence.
7:35
I will take this sentence. I will increase the size.
7:45
Right? So let's say if I enter
7:51
this particular thing to a large language model, if I tell a large language model that a large language
7:56
model is a then it is going to return me neural. It is going to return to me the
8:02
next word. If I give it a complete sentence that a large language model is a neural then it is going to return me
8:10
network and then I will keep on iterating so that I'm able to get the complete sentence. So what is a large
8:16
language model? Large language model is
8:21
the next word or token predictor.
8:30
And when you do this repeated number of times, you get the complete sentence, the complete book, the complete essay,
8:36
the complete summary. Right? So this is the basic fundamental how a large model
8:42
works. You give it some sentence and complete sentences. It will try to complete it. And how this how does it
8:48
completes it? Let me go ahead and tell you. Okay. So understand first of all if you guys are able to observe I have
8:54
written token in the bracket. So what happens is whenever you give a word to a large
Tokenization and Training Data
9:02
language model. Okay. So let's say I give a word to language model that he lives
9:09
near the river bank.
9:16
He lives near the river bank. Okay. So large language model is a machine. It's
9:23
an algorithm. It's a code. it will not be able to understand what are these exact words. In order to make
9:31
sure that the machine is able to understand everything, what we do is
9:36
we convert this into numbers. So in order to make sure that the machine is able to understand things efficiently,
9:42
we convert these into numbers. These numbers are called as tokens.
9:47
Let me show you how it works. So I'll go to a website called as tick tokenizer
9:53
where if I write this sentence
9:58
the sentence is he lives near the
10:05
river bank right now the large language model has converted this
10:14
the large language model has converted this into these tokens. So these are the
10:19
tokens right? Every model can generate
10:24
different kind of tokens. Every model has different kind of combination of tokens. Okay. The tokens are generated
10:31
to make sure that the large language model is able to efficiently utilize its
10:36
memory and context because numbers are easier to interpret for machines rather than the words.
10:45
Right? And in total in English language we have around 26 alphabets and we would
10:52
have so many maybe millions of applications, millions of spellings, right? Vocabulary. In GPT4 we have 100k
11:02
tokens, right? So what is a token? Token is a
11:07
numerical representation of your text. Token is a numerical representation of
11:13
your text. Right. And at a high level,
11:18
three words in English is equal to sorry
11:24
at a high level in English two words are equal to three tokens
11:32
at a high level like not this is not completely true in all the cases but for most of the times on an average two
11:38
words is equal to three tokens. Why tokens are important? to understand if you go to any of these application let's
11:44
say let's understand open AI pricing so if you look at pricing of any of
11:50
these models you'll be able to understand that they work on tokens how many tokens are input how many
11:57
tokens are generated how many tokens are cashed right so for every 1 million tokens that
12:03
you give to charge GP it is going to ask you for the input it is going to take $1.25 $25 from you. Right? So what is a
12:10
token? Token is a conversion of your words
12:16
into mathematical numbers so that the model is able to understand them very
12:21
very efficiently. Right? How many tokens are possible in a
12:26
model is called as the vocabulary
12:33
size of the model. How many tokens are possible in a model
12:40
is called as the vocabulary size of the model.
12:46
Right? So this is this is called as
12:53
the tokenization. Right? Now what happens the purpose of an LLM is that if
13:00
you give it a set of tokens let's say 1 2 3 4 5 it will try to predict what is
13:05
the next token then if you run it again then this becomes your full sentence up
13:12
to six then it will generate seven and then you have new sentence 1 to 7 and
13:17
then it will generate eight. So it is going to go ahead and complete the sequence. Right? That is at the most
13:24
fundamental level how large language models work. Right?
13:31
Everyone a quick yes or no if you're able to understand everything so far.
13:36
A quick yes or no before I could go ahead.
13:42
Wonderful. Great. Now let me go ahead. But this is a simple explanation. But
13:48
how does it happen? How does it predicts? Okay. So what happens is
13:55
this is how a large language model works. Okay. So there are three stages. Whenever you we
14:01
create whenever we create
Stages of Large Language Model Training
14:07
a large language model, we use these three stages. Every large
14:13
language model is created by going through these three stages. The first stage is called as a pre-training stage.
14:22
The second stage is called as the training stage. And the third training is called as a post
14:28
training stage. Right? So in the pre-training state, understand what happens is
14:35
the models are able to predict the next token very accurately because they are very good with pattern
14:42
recognition. So what we do is we need to train this model on a lot of data. We
14:48
need to train these models on a lot of data. Okay. But before that let me tell
14:54
you let me help you understand why this data is necessary. Okay. So how many of you
15:02
can tell me what is this? Tell me in the chat what is this
15:10
guys? Go ahead and tell me in the chat what is this?
15:21
Wonderful. That means you guys have studies in the uh in the elementary
15:28
mathematical classes, right? So y= mx is nothing. It is a very simple equation.
15:35
It is the equation of a line. any straight line. This is y-axis. This is x- axis. This is the slope and maybe
15:43
this is the intercept.
15:50
Right? So this is a simple equation that is y = mx + c. Right? Now if I want to
15:57
know what is the value of y at this value of
16:03
x. If I want to know what is the value of y at this value of x. So x is the
16:10
input and y is the output.
16:17
So now if I want to know what is the value of x at this what is the point of
16:22
y at this value of x because there are two things right now I might not be able
16:28
to understand because there are two parameters which are unknown to me I will not be able to understand but what
16:34
if I already know two values of input and two values of output so let's say somehow I was able to find
16:42
that if x were our one if x is equal to 1 then y = 2 and when x =0 then y = 1.
16:56
Right? So let's say somehow it is given to me that this is true. This is called as
17:03
training data. Training data is something where the output and the input is known to me. Right? Right now what
17:11
I'll do is I will try to find out the value of m and c. So y = mx + c. I'll
17:19
put the value of x and I'll put the value of y. So 2 is equal to 1 into m +
17:26
c. 2 = m + c. So c = 2 - m.
17:35
Right? I also have the second value. So what I'll do is y = mx + c. That means 1
17:41
is equal to m into 0 + c. c = 1. Right? Now c = 1
17:51
and c = 2 - m which means m = 2 - c. 2 -
17:58
1 is equal to 1. So c= 1 and m= 1. Now the equation becomes
18:06
I have found all the parameters. I was able to find the value of M. I was able to find the value of C. So C is 1 and M
18:15
is also one. So the equation is Y = X + 1. Now you give me any kind of input in
18:21
the world. Give me any kind of output in the world. Give me any kind of input in the world and I'll be able to tell you
18:27
what is going to be the output. Right? You give me any kind of input in
18:32
the world and I'll be able to give you the output. Right? Now if you go ahead and amplify the same thing, if you go
18:41
ahead and amplify the same concept to billion number of times. So now what happens is
18:48
a large language model is a equation like this
18:56
but it contains almost greater than a billion parameters.
19:03
Right? So in order to find two parame in order to find two value of parameters m and c I needed to
19:12
have two values of input and output also called as training data. Training data
19:17
that I already know right in the case of a large language model a
19:23
large language model is nothing. It is a very complicated mathematical equation
19:30
plus the equation contains a lot of parameters. How many parameters? Maybe
19:35
billions of parameters. Right? So in order to determine these
19:41
parameters, what I need to do? I need to have billions of
19:48
training data, which is I need to have large training data, right? And then this is repeated
19:55
multiple number of times to get the values of these parameters. So how do we get this training data? We get this
20:01
training data from the pre-training. So before we train any model, what we do is we crawl the internet.
20:09
We look at the forums. We take the books that are written already,
20:15
literature, well-written books. And then we convert this data, we clean this
20:20
data, and then we train on this data. How do we train? How do we train on this data? Understand?
20:27
Any piece of text that you have that piece of text can be converted into
20:33
two parts the input and the output. For example,
20:39
let's say in the training data I was able to get this.
20:44
So I have written a blog around a IML product management. Okay. So let's say I
20:50
have this sentence. So I will collect
20:56
I will collect a lot of data. I will break down this data into small parts so that I'm able to feed it to the large
21:01
language model and that then what I'll do is let's say one of the training data is this
21:10
one of the training data is this. So what I'll do is
21:18
I know that this sentence is correct. So what I'll do is I will just feed this
21:23
part I will feed this part
21:30
as the input and this part as the output because what does a large level model does if you go ahead and give it
21:40
if you go ahead and give it any sentence it will try to complete it. So I'll give
21:46
multiple billions of rows and billions of uh let's say components of data in
21:51
the form of input and output and when the large language model will learn it will learn from these patterns and then it will be able to give you almost real
21:58
kind of reasoned answers right a quick yes or no everyone if you
22:04
are able to understand this I have tried to help you understand
22:10
large language models with the help of a very simplistic A linear equation.
22:28
Yes. Cool. Now let's go ahead.
22:38
Yes.
22:43
Cool. Now we have understood this. Now let me go ahead and take you one step
22:49
ahead. Okay. So now everyone please look at this very carefully. So how does a model trains itself. What
22:55
happens is this is what the structure is. You have the training data. In the
23:00
training data, let's say you have this sentence. You are going to break this sentence into two parts.
23:08
One part is this the initial part of the sentence. Other part is this the later
23:13
part of the sentence. The initial part of the sentence is the input
23:18
and the later part of the sentence is the output. So ideally what you want is you want the
23:24
model you want the model to behave in a way
23:29
that whenever you write how LLMs it should complete with work. Okay, this
23:36
is what you want. So what you'll do is you will break the sentence. This is one sentence. This other sentence you are
23:42
going to tokenize it. Tokenize as in you are going to convert it into
23:47
maybe some kind of numbers. Okay. And every model that you are running they
23:53
would have their own method. So there are some free and available APIs available through which you can go ahead
23:59
and tokenize your content into any kind of numbers. Okay. So we have done the
24:04
tokenization. Now whatever are the input tokens tokens for
24:12
how LLMs are going to be feed as an input right and the output token is going to
24:18
be here I'll take I'll tell you how it is going to work right so now it will be
24:23
feed into a large language model okay a large language model is a specific kind
24:29
of uh I would say uh right now we are talking about a large language model which is a neural network and the Type
24:35
of the neural network is transformer. I'll talk about what a transformer is in brief in tomorrow's session. Okay. So a
24:42
transformer what is a transformer? It is nothing but a mathematical expression
The Role of Transformers and GPUs
24:48
a non- mathematical expression understand it thousand times more complicated than the line equation that
24:54
I have given you. And it contains the parameters the constant that I have told you right. And the purpose of this large
25:02
language model training is to identify the value of these parameters to identify the value of M, C and other
25:09
parameters that it has. It can have billions of parameters. Right now what will happen? It will initially when it
25:16
is not trained, it will try to generate anything random. Okay? And also
25:21
understand one thing that the large language models
25:26
are not deterministic. Listen to this very carefully. This is super important to understand the
25:31
language of large language models. I told you that they are next
25:37
token predictors. Predictors means they will
25:42
not tell you that this is a token after this. They will give you some probabilities. So
25:51
he is a this is the input and the large
25:56
language model is going to give you probabilistic outputs. So it is going to give you many options. It is it will
26:02
tell you he is a man, he is a boy,
26:08
he's a father, he's a singer. So there are multiple probabilities, right? And then he's it
26:15
is also going to tell you the L language model that what is the probability. So let's say man the probability is 0.5 boy
26:22
the probability 0.4 father probability is 0.05 single probability is 0.05.
26:30
Right? So it will not tell you the one answer. It will not just give you one answer. It will give you the
26:35
probabilities of what other words could be there and then you can go ahead and choose the top word or second word
26:41
whatever your large language model can go ahead and pick up. Okay. So always remember the large language models are
26:49
not deterministic. They are stochastic
26:56
which means they can go ahead and pick random words
27:02
which are going to be correct in some context but if you go ahead and give same prompt to same model at the same
27:08
time it can go ahead and give you different kind of outputs right so this is important nature of an
27:16
LLM to know and this is also going to be of foundation of when we go ahead and learn about AI evaluations Right?
27:25
And how does it generates this? It generates on the basis of training. So it would have seen a lot of data and
27:30
based on that data it generates that yes I think this should be the probability based on what I have learned.
27:37
Right? Yes.
27:46
Cool. Now going back to a diagram. So what will
27:51
happen here is what we have done so far is we have done the tokenization we have taken the input part we have feed it
27:58
into the transformer the transformer has generated some random results and then what will happen we have the real actual
28:05
token the actual token is going to be the meaning of work like the the the
28:14
numerical token for work. Okay. And here it is going to generate something. Now
28:19
it will be compared that work should have a probability of one or work should
28:25
be at the top of the predicted numbers or the predictive tokens and then we are
28:31
going to calculate the difference that it should be word it should be work but it is not work. So it is going to share
28:37
this feedback with the transformer and then what
28:43
transformer will do is transformer will correct the parameters inside and then this model will run on multiple
28:51
training sets for billions and trillions of time and then you are going to go ahead and get a model that is going to
28:58
accurately predict what should be the next probable word. Right? So what we do is we give it the
29:05
training model. We have the output. We have the input. Then we check we check
29:11
the difference between the real output and the expected output. Right? Then we calculate the difference which is called
29:17
as a loss function which is called as a mathematical loss function. This is passed as a feedback
29:23
feedback to the large language model. And then when it keeps on doing this billion number of times it is able to
29:28
set a very accurate value of these parameters.
29:35
Right? If you run it a number of times, you will have a pretty accurate model or a large language model. Right?
29:41
Understand? If the number of parameters are in a race of billions, this is
29:47
called as a large language model. If it is less than billions, maybe in the ratio of millions, it will be called as a small language model. Example of a
29:54
large language model. Example of a large language model is Gemini chat GPT spell
30:00
uh example of a small language model is Google's Gemma
30:09
right yes quickly everyone a quick yes or no in the chat if you're able to understand
30:15
this at least at a high level
30:22
wonderful great you guys are intelligent great amazing
30:32
So loss function understands the difference between
30:38
what is the predicted token and what is the actual token and then it pass on this feedback to the transformer. The
30:45
transformer adjusts everything accordingly. Right
30:52
now a bigger question that is that should aride arise in your mind is that why all
30:58
of these things are happening after 2021 like uh why all of these things are happening very recently why not before
31:05
okay so understanding language
31:10
understanding language is not an easy task for machines why because of this
31:16
reasons so let's say my sentence is he lives
31:22
near the river bank.
31:28
Right? Initially, traditionally what people used to do was if they want to create
31:34
any kind of AI, if they want to create any kind of predictive model or intelligent model, what they will do is
31:40
they will work on word by word. You might have seen autocorrect in your
31:46
mobile phones, right? Whenever you try to write something, it will only catch the last word and then based on it, it
31:51
is going to predict. It will not look at the entire sentence. Okay. But people who are able to understand, people who
31:57
understand NLP or natural language
32:02
processing or programming, they were able to understand that it's not enough.
32:08
They were able to understand that if if we want to really understand
32:15
language, we need to understand the meaning of each word with respect to that sentence.
32:22
For example, in this particular sentence
32:29
I have written he lives near the river bank. So in this bank means the side of the
32:37
river. Right? But if I did not know this sentence, I could have as well concluded
32:43
that this bank is a financial institution.
32:49
So in 2017, a group of computer researchers
32:57
created a research paper, published a research paper. They all were working in the Google brain and deep mind team. And
33:05
the name of the paper was attention is all you need.
33:14
And they told they came up with the hypothesis that if we really want to
33:19
truly understand the language models, if we truly want to understand the language rather than looking at things token by
33:26
token, we should try to find out what are the relationships of these word with
33:32
entirety of the sentence. Initially these these predictive models can only look at one word at a time but now with
33:40
this approach we were able to go ahead and consume all the sentences and essays and whatever is
33:46
the context window at once. So every word is now able to map it relationship with other words. So these words are
33:53
created into tokens and vectors and then the relationship between all the vectors is calculated real time and then as a
34:01
whole we are able to understand what does this paragraph what does this sentence what does this context says
34:07
that was a very big shift of how genai was born okay but now because of that
34:14
one problem occurred the problem was the sequential
34:19
processing of data was easy It can be done on a CPU but if you need to process
34:25
multiple sentences multiple parts of the sentences at once understand when I'm talking about the sentence
34:33
he lives near the river bank
34:40
at once the algorithm or the computer has to calculate
34:47
this relationship of he with lives with near with the with river with bank. Then
34:54
parallelly it needs to understand the relationship of lives with he near the
35:01
river bank and then it also needs to understand the relationship of this with this. So now understand this is
35:07
complicated maths. This is resource
35:15
intensive maths. Resource intensive maths. It will take time. It will take
35:20
effort. It will take a lot of processing power, right? So in order to create a
35:25
good solid large language model, you need two things. First, you need a lot
35:30
of data on which you can train so that AI is able to find patterns. Plus, you need
35:37
super huge processing power. And now people started thinking where do
35:44
we get this processing power from? because quantum computers are not yet invented at least at the scale for
35:50
practical purposes and CPUs are very much limited.
35:56
Then people thought that these kind of metric multiplication like one to many multiplication also happen at
36:04
gains and games are running on GPUs. So people understood that yes
36:12
transformer is an architecture. So the neural networks or the algorithms
36:18
that operate in this way by calculating the uh the relationship of one word with
36:24
every other word. These kind of algorithms are called as transformers.
36:31
They work on the mechanism of attention which is one word is paying attention to every other word in the sentence.
36:37
Attention means one word is paying attention to every other word in the sentence to derive its meaning. Right?
36:43
And then the neural networks or the algorithms that use attention as a mechanism to predict are called as
36:49
transformers. Right? And transformers are best run on
36:57
the same technology that runs these complicated games with is GPUs.
37:02
Right? So this is a history about how GPUs were best suited for running large
37:08
language models. And that is also the reason why we were able to get a huge
37:14
jump here. We were able to get a huge jump here.
37:21
Right everyone, a quick yes or no if you're able to understand this.
37:29
Yes. If I see one more LinkedIn link in the chat, I'm going to block you. Don't
37:35
distract other guys, please.
38:05
That's so large language models run on GPUs. They are trained on GPUs.
38:14
Right? Now, so we have understood this. Now let's go ahead. Okay. Now the third part, I have
38:21
told you about the two parts already. The third interesting part of a large language model.
38:27
So we have talked about pre-training, we have talked about pre-training, we
38:32
have talked about training. Now the third part is post-training. Now after you generate, after you train
38:39
a large language model on all the internet data that is available, you get
Post-Training and Reducing Hallucinations
38:44
a personality like a baby. A baby has the ability to think. It has the ability
38:50
to perceive its surroundings and they will also be able to go ahead and maybe blabber a few words, right? But they
38:57
don't have a personality yet. So depending upon a baby is born in a Hindu family or a Muslim family or a
39:03
particular culture, they are going to get their nature. So if you are reading Quran, you are going to think this is
39:09
the God. If you are going to read maybe Gita, you are going to understand that maybe this is the God. Okay? Reality
39:14
could be something else altogether. But based on how you are conditioned,
39:20
based on how you are trained after you are in the world, that is called as postraining. That gives you a
39:26
personality. So postraining is very important. It converts
39:32
the next token predictor machine
39:38
next token predictor machine to a helpful
39:44
assistant. It converts the next token predictor m machine to a helpful assistant. Right?
39:51
So what we do is we hire real human laborers like
39:58
what what do we call it? People who go ahead and label the data. So these
40:04
people give accurate information to the large language models and then this data is feed again into the training and then
40:12
the large language model gets a personality. For example, there is one thing that large language models have
40:19
struggled for a long period of time. Okay. So large language models generally tend to hallucinate. Although the
40:25
hallucination has reduced very uh very recently but still there is
40:32
let's say a lot of hallucination still. Okay. So Meta came up with this very interesting perspective. What they did
40:37
was they just give some sample input
40:42
and output to the large language models. In the input they told some random
40:48
question like question for which the answer is not possible right for example they created some
40:55
random names and ask GPT or ask let's say llama that who is this person
41:01
initially before this training llama or chat GPT they are going to give you random answers even if the person does
41:07
not exist they will try to frame something that is called a hallucination they are going to give you wrong answer but they'll give you with complete
41:12
confidence right so what meta did was it gave them some questions which did not have any answer and in the output they
41:19
mentioned they asked the llama model to give the answer as I do not know about
41:25
this I do not know about this and then once the large language model started understanding that yes I can give the
41:31
answer that I do not know about this that is okay right to show you some other sample data
41:39
okay so this is how the data looks like for example we want to understand about summarization we want to make sure that
41:44
our model is able to summarize. So we go give this kind of input. Summarize the following passage about neural network
41:50
in one paragraph. A neural network is composed of layers of neurons that transforms inputs. Okay. So we'll give this prompt and then this is the desired
41:58
output. This will also be feeded into the large language model and then we
42:04
will be able to retrain it again and again in this data to make sure that we are able to get the right answer.
42:11
Right? we are able to go ahead and get the right answer. Okay. And then these are the methods in which we are going to
42:18
test. It has to be clear factual summary and neutral to right. So we give all of
42:23
these feeds to large language model after it is created to the base model and then we are able to get a more
42:29
intelligent model. Right? Now guys, all of this data, all of these files, all of these
42:34
presentations, the notes and everything would be given to you if you remain till the end of the session today and then we
42:40
are going to go ahead and uh and you go ahead and give the submit the feedback form. Okay.
42:47
Yes. Cool. So I hope everyone was able to
42:53
understand how large language models works. Everyone please tell me on a scale of 1 to five if you're able to understand whatever I have told you so
42:59
far. On a scale of 1 to five, please. One you did not understand, five you understood it well.
43:10
Cool. We have 821 people. Amazing. Great.
43:19
Super. Super guys. Amazing. Amazing. Thank you. Yes.
43:24
People who are not able to understand, just look at the recording. I'm sure you'll be able to go ahead and understand this well. Yes. Cool. People
43:31
are not able to understand, please focus better. Please focus better in the session.
43:37
Yes.
43:51
Cool. Let me just go ahead.
43:56
Yes. So now based on whatever I have told you now let us go back to economics. Okay.
44:03
So we have talked about mathematics, we have talked about computer science, we have talked about psychology of a model. Now let's back go back to economics and
44:10
the business. Okay. So as a product manager you need to
AI Product Management Value Chain
44:16
understand at what levels is the value created in the large
44:21
language models by the large language models. Okay. So the first layer is the
44:27
infrastructure layer. This is the layer on top of which large language models
44:32
operate. Okay. What they do is here we have companies such as Nvidia and Google's
44:39
Vert.x AI which provides the tensors or the GPUs where these models can run. So
44:45
they provide computation data platform GPUs and all right. So the core
44:50
technology that you need which is infrastructure which is uh how where do you deploy
44:55
these models is provided by these infrastructure layer companies. The second layer is the model layer
45:02
companies who are creating and owning these models. Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Grock
45:09
uh and Deep Seek these are the companies which are owning these models and they will give you large language models,
45:16
small language models. They will also give you fine-tuning. What is finetuning? We are going to discuss in the coming sessions. Right now, this is
45:22
the core. Now, on top of this, there is a bigger opportunity that you as a
45:27
product manager can utilize all of these technologies like these models in order
45:35
to build some amazing use cases. So, lovable, gamma, chat, GPT, Gemini, they
45:42
are all based on this model and the infra layer. So you as a product manager
45:49
can play a very important role in the application. Application layer is how are you able to utilize the power of a
45:56
large language model in order to solve the problems for your customers.
46:02
Right? So internet is provided by someone else. The routers are provided by someone else. But Amazon has created
46:09
an application on top of internet which is able to give you the e-commerce at your doorstep.
46:16
Tinder has created an application on the top of internet so that you are able to find your next state. Similarly in AI
46:22
you should be able to create a lot of applications on these on the top of these large language models so that you
46:28
are able to create a lot of value right and the fourth layer is you can
46:34
use these tools you can use these large language model based tools such as chat
46:40
GPT such as GMA such as Kurser in order to make your clients and make yourself
46:45
more productive. So service agency companies such as TCS, Realast and all they will use these tools and then they
46:52
will help the company achieve their outcomes. Right? So this is the whole value chain.
46:59
People create infra then some people create model some people create application based on model and some people create services. Okay. But this
47:06
is where you can drive a lot of value without investing a lot of money.
47:12
And this is value at scale. Right? All of the companies here, all of
47:18
these companies are same companies. They don't own models. What they do is they work on top
47:26
of models created by other companies, right? And they are able to generate a lot of value.
47:33
Right? Now, based on this gen AI value stack, we can divide multiple kind of AIPM jobs. Okay? So, first of all,
47:40
understand that every PM is an AIPM. If you are using any kind of AI technology
47:46
in your life, GPT, Gemini or anything, you are an AIPM. So I divide AIPM into
47:52
two parts. The first part is the AI enabled PMS.
47:58
These are people who are using products like Chat GPT, Lovable, Jira or any
48:04
other AI product in order to make themsel more productive
48:09
in order to solve problems for their customers. in order to save time in order to provide more impact. So anyone
48:17
any PM who is a user of any of these AI tools they are an AI enabled team. So
48:22
100% of all of us are AI enabled PMs. Right. The second is AI product PM. Now
48:30
this is where the value is. This is what we are going to talk about which we have talked in the last sess in the uh today's session as well initially and
48:36
then we are going to talk about today more and in the next session as well. Okay. So AI product PMs can be divided
48:42
into two parts. One is the core AIPM. These core AIPMs need to understand how
48:48
the technology behind AI works. So training, pre-training, post-raining,
48:55
how do you create a large language model? How do you store? How do you make it efficient? How do you consider memory
49:01
of a large language model? All of these core things are the responsibility of a core AIPM. So people who are creating
49:07
the infra or the model are the core AIPMs. These people need to be technical and they should have a solid
49:13
understanding of machine learning in order to become a core IP.
49:18
Whatever I have told you so far about how GP works and all this is a work of a core IPM.
49:23
The second kind of PMS where most of you should be going is applied AIPM. Now
49:30
applied AIPM are the people who are creating useful applications by using these core technologies. So people who
49:37
are building notion AI, Grammarly, lovable, chat, GPT, people who are building these products are applied AI
49:45
PMs. Applied AI means the people who are
49:50
actually using AI tools like AI technologies such as models and infra in
49:55
order to build something helpful for their customers. Okay. So these are the only the users.
50:02
These are the core technology creators and these are the product creators.
50:07
Right? So can you guys tell me where do you fall right now? What is your best description right now?
50:15
Where do you fall right now?
51:19
Yes,
51:26
wonderful. So all of you fall under the AI enabled part right now but eventually you should go ahead and
51:34
Yeah guys, everyone is trying to focus and learn. Please do not put any kind of
51:40
links in the chat. I've already blogged a couple of people. Do not let me to do it more. Let us go ahead and focus on
51:46
the session. Cool. Now
51:52
this is the differentiation. Everyone is here. If you are coming from already a very
51:58
strong technical background, you should try to move here. But everyone, even if you are coming from a technical or nontechnical background, you can always
52:04
move here. This is where I want you to move.
52:09
Okay. Now let's go ahead. Okay. So tell
52:15
me everyone. Tell me everyone if you are able to understand this meme. Look at this very
52:22
carefully and tell me if you are able to understand this meme.
52:42
Yes, cool. So understand there are like so much valution that has been created
52:47
in all of these things. Okay, this is sitting on the top of LLMs. Okay, so I'm
52:52
going to give you some examples of how various kind of technology the various
52:59
kind of technologies are working on top of these large language models. Okay,
53:04
but we are right on time. We will take a quick break here. We will take a quick
53:09
break of five minutes and then we will come back. Okay. So now let me go ahead and tell you
53:17
how do So now you have understood that yes a large language model. Okay. So
53:25
there is something called as
53:30
a large language model.
53:36
which is provided by companies such as Open AI,
53:42
Anthropic, Meta, Google and many more. Okay, these are
53:50
the large language models that are provided by so many companies. Now,
53:57
right now, this large language models can do three things for you.
54:04
Okay, the first thing is they can understand
54:10
content. They can understand what you are trying to say because they have seen so many
54:16
patterns of data. They're able to understand what you are trying to say. Okay. So if you ask it to generate a
54:22
summary, it will be able to understand the whole paragraph and then it will generate the summary. Okay. The second
54:27
is it is able to transform content.
54:34
Transform means if you ask it to create a summary of some content, it will
54:39
transform that into summary. If you ask it to create a quiz on some content, it will be able to transform that into
54:45
code. Okay. And the third part is it is able to generate content. So if you want
54:50
it to generate images, code anything it because it is data it should be able to generate because it has seen enough code
54:56
in its life right. So it will be able to go ahead and generate. So as a large language model the capabilities of a so
55:03
as a product manager you should understand that there are three core capabilities of a large language model. The first is it can understand second is
55:11
it can transform and third is it can generate data. Right? So you can use it for multiple
55:18
ways. You can use it to generate summary. You can use it to
55:24
generate answers for your questions. You can use it to generate code. And you can generate for almost everything that you
55:32
want, right? And because they have been trained on tons of data, tons of
55:38
terabytes of data, generally the accurations are very accurate. So now what happens? So far whatever the
55:44
software that we used to create so far whatever the software that we were used
55:50
to create these softwares were generally of four types. Okay. So any software that we
55:56
have used so far what they will do is they will generally create a data they will read data they will update the data
56:02
or they will delete the data. So all the software that we have seen let's say Facebook on Facebook what happens you go ahead and create a profile and then on
56:10
your profile some database element is created and then your people can see your profile some people can go ahead
56:16
and upload some videos and then you are able to see these videos and entertain yourself so generally most of the
56:21
application before the AI world were actually create read update and delete
56:28
this is called as application but now AI has been able to give
56:33
a brain to your softwares. So as a product
56:39
manager, you need to understand what this large language model can do and how can I utilize it to create better
56:46
products. Right? So
56:51
I'm going to give you this understanding with the help of few examples. Okay? So
56:57
there is a product called as granola. Okay. And this product is similar to
AI Note Takers: A Case Study
57:04
many other products. So it's a very simple product that if you go ahead and use granula,
57:09
it will go ahead and get added to your calendar and whenever you are joining the meeting, it will take the transcription
57:17
and recording of that meeting and it is going to summarize the meeting for you so that you do not have to pick up a notebook every time. What happens is
57:24
whenever we are joining the meetings we have to write down that what are the things that are discussed so that we do not forget and then we create a minutes
57:30
meeting like the minutes of the meeting right so there are multiple tools like granola there is fireflies otter fathom
57:37
most of you most of them which you can see also on the uh the attendee list right because many people have added
57:44
their note takers so now how these noteers are created what is the value behind them so I'm going to show you a
57:50
simple tear down Okay. So,
57:57
everyone a quick yes or no in the chat if you understand what a AI noteaker is.
58:14
Amazing. Great. Yes.
58:20
Yes. So now let us try to understand how this product works and this is like a
58:25
very important case. It will help you understand how AI products are built. Okay. So first of all understand
58:31
everyone whenever you create any product as a product manager
58:36
you have to look at five angles. Don't just go ahead and just think about
58:44
technology. Technology is one important part but it is not the most important part. But AI is just a piece of
58:51
technology. So do not focus on just using AI. Focus on solving the problem of the user. So whenever you look at any
58:57
product, please ask yourself five questions. Right? The five questions are
59:04
what problem does it solves in people's life? Right? What problem does it solves in
59:11
people lives? Okay. So can you guys tell me? to think about it
59:16
for a moment and then tell me in the chat what do you think what are the problems that granola solves in people's
59:23
life think about this as a product manager this is the most important value that
59:29
you need to add that how am I being useful to the users what problem does it solve so tell me what is a problem that
59:36
these note takers solve
59:49
Yes. Very good. So at a task level, it helps you record and
59:56
summarize your meetings. But that is just an output. The outcome
1:00:01
is that it is able to save you time and it will help you be more accurate
1:00:07
because when you are writing something it might be possible that yes you are missing something and you also have to
1:00:13
invest a lot of time and attention when you are writing things right so granular
1:00:19
saves you time it makes you more efficient and accurate always remember
1:00:24
it is okay if you're not using AI in your product AI is not a silver bullet that will improve your But if the
1:00:31
product does not have a value, if you are not able to clearly define why this product should exist, then please do not
1:00:37
create the product. Okay, this is the most effective value that you add as a product manager. Okay, now the second
1:00:44
part which is a business value. Why should the business per pursue this
1:00:50
opportunities? Okay, think about this for a moment everyone and then tell me in the chat
1:00:56
why should the business pursue this opportunities? How do you find this out?
1:01:03
Let us keep it collaborative so that everyone is able to learn accordingly.
1:01:20
Yes. So now what we'll do is now what we will do is we will try to understand that if
Understanding Market Opportunity for Meeting Assistants
1:01:28
we are creating a meeting assistant how many people in the world are first
1:01:34
looking for this kind of solution. So you will have a prediction that people who are a part of small
1:01:40
businesses or large businesses they are going to love this kind of solution because they are going to save time and
1:01:46
then you are going to understand how many people are there who are working in these small businesses. how many small businesses are there and then you are
1:01:53
going to size a market opportunity. Okay, that is one way that it is going to help the business because there is a
1:02:00
large market opportunity and in order to do this research you can go ahead and use chat GPT notebook LM Gemini or
1:02:06
anything right that is the business value now the other kind of business value is let's say we are not talking
1:02:12
about granola we are talking about zoom right so because zoom already has a lot
Business Value and Strategic Opportunities
1:02:19
of users who are using its platform to conduct meetings it is an strategic
1:02:25
opport opportunity for Zoom. It is a strategic business opportunity for Zoom to create an inbuilt meeting assistant.
1:02:35
Right? So it aligns with the strategy and it also aligns with the market opportunity.
1:02:40
Right? So understand everyone as a product before being an AI product
1:02:45
manager, you are a product manager and the purpose of a product manager is to bring the user value and to bring the
1:02:51
business value. Right? Now the third thing is how do we
1:02:57
make sure that the product is intuitive for the user to
Designing Intuitive User Experiences
1:03:03
use. How do we make sure that the product is very intuitive. Right? So in all of these tools you
1:03:09
would have found that you do not have to do anything. You just install the tool you add it to your calendar.
1:03:15
Automatically whenever a meeting occurs the person the the meeting note taker would be automatically added. Granola
1:03:22
goes to the next level that right now this meeting is recorded with granular but you do not know why because it is
1:03:28
installed on my computer. It is taking over the microphone and the video and it is doing it by itself. So now you have
1:03:33
to do optimizations on the design part so that you are able to reduce the friction for the user. If I have to add
1:03:40
a granular every time, if I have to add uh uh this fireflies every time when I'm
1:03:46
doing a meeting that is going to be resistance for me right? So this is
1:03:51
called as being a proactive software. So they are able to get meeting into
1:03:58
meetings automatically. So you don't have to do the work automatically it is happening. Right? So this is the
1:04:03
intuitiveness and then they have created an interface so that I'm able to see what are the meetings that I have
1:04:08
conducted. I can go ahead and ask questions based on my meetings. Right? So this is the value part, business part
1:04:15
and the design part. The next part that we are going to understand today is how
Engineering Feasibility and AI Orchestration
1:04:21
will this be engineered. Engineered part is feasibility part. But please remember this line. User value
1:04:29
and business value as a product manager should be your first focus and feasibility should be the next focus.
1:04:36
Feasibility should not be the number one focus of a product manager right now. Please start with
1:04:42
the user problem and the business problems. That is what you add the most to the company. That is where you are
1:04:48
being most impactful rather than only talking about engineering and feasibility because there are people who are more eligible than you who can do
1:04:55
the task. Okay. So how will this AI product be orchestrated? But before that
1:05:00
everyone a quick yes or no in the chat if you are able to understand the three parts user value, business value and
1:05:07
design value. Amazing.
1:05:21
Wonderful.
1:05:28
Yes. So there is one person who has said no four number of times.
1:05:33
Great. So yes. So now we have understood the three
1:05:40
parts. Now let me give you a bit about engineering. Okay. So this is how this product looks at the back end. Now look
1:05:47
at this very carefully. Super important. If you just under understand this one product, I can assure you that you can
1:05:53
reverse engineer almost any AI product. So please focus on this slide. Okay. So
How AI Meeting Tools Work
1:05:58
behind granula whenever you do any meeting on zoom on
1:06:04
meet or anyone granola or fireflies or otter or any of
1:06:12
the meeting recording tools even the zoom tool they will be connecting to the
1:06:17
meeting either they can join the meeting as a bot or they will capture the content from
1:06:24
your screen whatever you are speaking they will take over your mic or they are going to ask the API. API as
1:06:31
in they will ask Zoom or Google Meet to share the recording or the transcript
1:06:37
if you have given the permission. Okay? So they will get
1:06:42
the audio of the meeting,
1:06:48
right? Once they get the audio of the meeting, they are going to convert that audio into text transcription.
1:06:56
There are multiple APIs available for the same. So, OpenAI has an API called as whisper where you give it audio. It
1:07:04
will be able to give you the transcript of that audio. There is also Google text to speech like uh speech to text where
1:07:11
you can just go ahead and give it a audio. It will be able to convert into accurate transcript.
1:07:18
Right? There are some smaller players as well which are assembly.ai and other players who can also do this job. Okay?
1:07:25
So now what we have is we have a transcript. Now this transcript is available with
1:07:31
us. What these people will do is what granula or fireflies will do is they will take this transcript and then they
1:07:39
will add a system prop. Okay. So this is a system prop.
1:07:53
So now everyone please look at this very carefully. Look at this very very carefully. So it is going to add this
1:08:00
prompt. The prompt is you are an expert chief of staff and noteaker.
1:08:05
Given the following raw meeting transcript, generate a structured and actionable summary that includes the following sections. meeting title,
1:08:14
data and participants, date and participants, key decision made, action items, open questions, summary, notable
1:08:20
quotes and then you have written some more instructions. Right? So this prompt might be created
1:08:28
by a product manager at granula which will convert a raw transcript that
1:08:35
is generated into very helpful meaning notes, meeting notes, right? And this
1:08:43
prompt plus this transcript would then be sent
1:08:50
to a large language model. Right? This will be sent to a large
1:08:57
language model such as Gemini or Jad GPD, right? And then it will do its
1:09:03
magic. It will create summary actionables and tasks. Okay? So this is
1:09:08
how these meeting tools work. And then what happens? You can take it to the
1:09:14
next step. You can make it more agentic. Agentic means they will take action. So what can happen is they can also go
1:09:19
ahead and push these tasks to your slack to your calendar or to your Jira. So now
1:09:26
you are just adding a meeting notetaker like a meeting assistant to your
1:09:32
calendar and then it will get the recording. It will do the transcript. It
1:09:38
will go ahead and create the summary with the help of system prompts and the transcript. then it can
1:09:45
go ahead and convert into multiple task and then it can also if you give it the permission it can also go ahead and add it to your Slack calendar or Jira right
1:09:53
so this simplistic architecture which is dependent on multiple LLMs and things is
1:09:58
now a possibility because large language models are possible
1:10:08
right everyone a quick yes or no if you are able to understand This
1:10:15
right? So I want you guys to think in this manner. Okay. I want you guys to
1:10:22
think in this manner.
1:10:46
Everyone a quick yes or no in the chat please.
1:10:52
Yes. So now large language models have unlocked intelligence for you. Okay. Now
1:10:59
you can use them like an expert in order to go ahead and do a lot of things.
1:11:05
Right? So now this is like a simple orchestration. Now you can think about how you can innovate on top of the same
1:11:13
right. So the history of granular is that that before granular there were players like fireflies, autoi and fedum.
1:11:19
What happened because of these was they will keep themselves added on. They will keep themselves added on.
1:11:30
Yes. They will keep themselves added on
1:11:37
multiple meetings and people generally get irritated if so many bots are joining the meeting. Okay. And it was
1:11:43
also not very privacy intense in incentive for intensive for other people. Okay. That people do not want
1:11:49
your bots to join their meetings. Okay. So Granla came up with a AI with a UI innovation. With Granla you don't have
1:11:56
to add anything. It will operate in your computer. It will listen to the audio and then it will it is going to automatically transcribe the meeting for
1:12:02
you and give you the context right so you can do these optimizations in order to make sure that you are able to go
1:12:09
ahead and yes you are able to go ahead and create a lot of things
1:12:15
right now the magic that you can add as a product manager is understand AI is not difficult you just have to
1:12:22
understand the concept that I'm telling you after that the next real skill that you have to develop is customer empathy
1:12:28
Understanding what customers want and giving them as soon as possible in the best design
1:12:34
possible. That is the value that you add as a product manager. Okay. Now we have talked about granular.
1:12:43
Now let's go to the next level. Okay. So granular is a very simple example. Okay.
1:12:50
The next example that we need to understand is okay. Okay. So one part is left.
1:12:57
That part is understand just building a product which is useful and business wants to build it and it is good design
1:13:03
it is good feasibility doesn't make sure that product is actually very very helpful
1:13:10
right doesn't make sure that the product is very very helpful
1:13:16
so there is one more thing okay
1:13:22
there is one more thing that is needed to make a product achieve its potential and generate revenue out
Growth Strategies for AI Products
1:13:29
of the for the company which is how do we grow this product in this market
1:13:35
which is creating a go to market strategy building
1:13:40
a product that is actually loved by the users creating distribution for the product making sure that people are
1:13:46
actually using the product that is called as the growth part so how do you grow in this market so all of these
1:13:52
meeting assistants they are viral by default So let's say I and you did a meeting
1:13:59
together and because I believe in productivity I do not believe in taking
1:14:04
notes manually. I have added a noteaker called as fireflies. Now when you see
1:14:11
this that in the meeting there is another thing which is fireflies. You are going to get curious that what is
1:14:17
this? I should also go ahead and check what is this. Okay. So by using virality they are going ahead and creating a
1:14:24
distribution right. Similarly whenever the meeting has ended most of these
1:14:30
people are going to send you emails. Let me show you one of the emails. Just give me a moment.
1:14:38
Let me check if I have those kind of emails. What is the name? Fireflies.
1:14:56
Yes. Cool. So, let's say
1:15:09
cool. So, this is the link. Okay. So generally
1:15:15
when we do the meeting this is the link that we received after that. Okay. So
1:15:20
someone added me to their meeting and they also added fireflies because they were using fireflies and after the meeting has ended it always sends me
1:15:27
this thing that this is what you have done. This is a summary this is the action item and it also tells me to go
1:15:34
ahead and if I click on view the meeting and all it will ask me to sign up.
1:15:39
Right? So these are some growth tactics that these people are implementing in order to make sure that it is able to
1:15:44
grow. The product is actually able to succeed. So marketing and growth is also
1:15:49
a good responsibility or a must have responsibility for a product manager, right? And understand guys, product
1:15:56
management is multi-dimensional. Not that you just create a great product and put all of your efforts into it and
1:16:02
it is going to work. You need marketing, you need stakeholder management, you need a bit of understanding of technology, you need a bit of
1:16:08
understanding of analytics so that you know if you are moving in the right direction. It's a multi-dimensional job.
1:16:15
Right? So this is the story behind granola. Now let me go ahead and give
1:16:21
you some more complicated examples. Okay? So
1:16:28
tell me everyone if you ask chat GPT
1:16:33
if you ask chat GPT that what is the most important item in my Google
1:16:38
calendar tomorrow would it be able to answer? If you ask GP that what is the most
1:16:44
important item in my calendar tomorrow would it be able to answer
1:16:55
yes if you have not connected a Google calendar it would not be able to answer
1:17:00
right and if I take example of let's say this particular product called as calendar is connected to Google but if I
1:17:07
ask about notion then Gemini will also be not be able to answer Right.
1:17:12
So now we have so much data in our calendar, in our to-do list, in our
1:17:18
Jiraa dashboard, in our stripe document like stripe dashboard. But how do we make sure that all of this content is
1:17:25
available to large language models so that they can go ahead and give us the answers. So rather than asking like
1:17:30
rather than thinking that where is the PD what is the task that I need to do today from my Jira or notion I should
1:17:37
just ask a query that what are the three things that I need to get done today and then it should give me the answer. Okay
1:17:42
if I want to go to this level what I can do is a very simple approach that I can
1:17:48
do is I can just go ahead and give all the data from my notion or stripe or
1:17:53
atlation to the large language model. Okay. But when I give a lot of data to
1:18:00
the large language model, what happens? The model runs out of context.
1:18:09
Okay? Because these models cannot carry infinite context. Context
1:18:15
means the kind of input that you can provide to these models.
1:18:20
Right? So now we have to work we have to work hard to make sure that these models work. Okay? And also although companies
1:18:27
are trying to increase the context window as much as possible, there has been research that is done by
1:18:34
great people at Chroma which is a vector-based database company. They were able to find that as you increase the
1:18:42
context, as you increase the context, the performance of the model goes down.
1:18:48
Even if these people claim that our model can work in so much context, when these people actually tested multiple
1:18:54
models, they were able to find in almost all the models that as the context or the input size increases, if you
1:19:01
increase the size of your prompts, then the quality of performance actually
1:19:07
reduces after a certain level. Right? So now understand as a product manager, so
1:19:13
even if someone is not able to understand this or this, at least you'll be able to understand this. Okay. So
1:19:19
when you give concise input context to the large language models, they appear
1:19:24
to be very intelligent and very insightful and very careful. But when you go ahead and give them too large
1:19:30
input, then they don't know what they are doing and they get confused. Okay. So now how to solve this? What we
1:19:37
do is we have another methodology called as context engineering. Context
Introduction to Context Engineering
1:19:43
engineering means how do you carefully curate what should go as an input to the
1:19:50
large language model so that it is accurate so that you have given the
1:19:55
right kind of information so that you are able to get the right kind of insight or output from the large
1:20:01
language model right so this is called as context engineering so context engineering I am
1:20:07
going to quote the person who has acquainted this term which is and
1:20:13
Karpathi. So he says that context engineering is the delicate art and
1:20:19
science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step.
1:20:25
Art and science means you have to apply your mind. You have to think creatively to give enough context to the large
1:20:31
language model so that it is able to answer you in the most accurate format.
1:20:37
Right? So this is context engineering and in context engineering we do multiple things. Okay. One of the point
1:20:44
of context engineering is prompt engineering. How well you write the prompt is a part of context engineering.
1:20:52
Okay. But apart from prompt what happens is you need to give some data about your
1:20:57
software. For example, if you want to build a software called as notion AI. Okay. So
1:21:06
let's say you will to you want to build a software called as not not motion AI but let's say you want to build a
1:21:17
Bloomberg chatbot. What is a Bloomberg chatbot? Bloomberg
1:21:22
is an organization which has access to a lot of financial data available in the world.
1:21:28
Right? So now what you want to do is that whatever the data is available with Bloomberg you should be able to send a
1:21:35
question to a large language model in a natural language and then it should be able to give you answer based on the
1:21:42
content that is available with Bloomberg. Right? So here the problem is you cannot
1:21:49
store all the content that Bloomberg has in the context window. You cannot have
1:21:55
all this content as the input. Why? because it is going to run out of context. So what you will do is you will
1:22:01
carefully build something called as a R a
1:22:06
pipeline. Now this is a very important concept. Even if you remotely want to become an
RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation
1:22:12
AI product manager or AI practitioner, you need to understand this. This is like a very basic thing that every
1:22:19
person who calls themsel AI enabled has to understand. Okay. So rag means
1:22:27
retrieval, augment
1:22:33
and generate. retrieval, augment and generate.
1:22:41
Okay. So what happens when
1:22:46
someone comes to your house and they tell you that I need some sugar. Okay.
1:22:54
When they tell you, "I need some sugar." You don't go to your study room and you do not look for
1:23:01
sugar in you do not start by looking for sugar in your cupboard or in your
1:23:07
wardrobe or in let's say your library or maybe under your sofa. What you do is
1:23:12
you straight away understand that sugar is an item that might be available
1:23:18
in my kitchen in a particular shelf. It might be possible you don't know that which part of shelf that it is put on
1:23:24
but you know a particular shelf or maybe you at least know that it is going to be found in the kitchen. Similarly, if your
1:23:30
kid asks for a book or if they ask for money, you do not go ahead and go anywhere else in the house. You know
1:23:36
where the money is put. You are going to just pick the room where the money is. Then you are going to pick a particular
1:23:42
wallet and then you are going to see in the wallet that yes in all of these four to five pockets there could be a place
1:23:49
where I have put the money. Right? So at a high level you know that where this information is the same analogy can be
1:23:56
drawn to rag. So in rag what we do is the first part is
1:24:04
we get all the data. We get all the data. For example, we have PDFs or a
1:24:09
better example is we have Bloomberg data. So Bloomberg data is they have a lot of
1:24:15
files. So we are going to break down files into small small chunks maybe in
1:24:22
the form of paragraphs. Okay. So we have one chunk, we have another chunk, we have another chunk. We are going to
1:24:27
create all of these chunks which are small enough and meaningful enough. Okay. We are going to break down this
1:24:33
data. Now in this data what we'll do is
1:24:40
what we'll do is now we have the chunking of data. Now what we'll do is we will convert these data chunks into
1:24:47
something called as vector embeddings. Now listen to this very very carefully. Super important. If you miss this you
1:24:52
will miss rag. Okay I'll repeat this again. You will take the data whatever data is
1:25:00
available you will break it down into small chunks and then when you have
1:25:05
these small chunks you will create you will convert these chunks into vector embedding. So what is a vector
1:25:10
embedding? So quick oneonone on vector embedding that like large language models we have also
1:25:18
created algorithms which are able to create any form of
1:25:23
text into a numerical
1:25:30
representation numerical representation as in let's say
1:25:39
I have a word called as cat
1:25:44
right so I have created a mathematical representation of cat okay what is a
1:25:49
mathematical representation I have assigned some numbers okay so let's say the number is 1a 2a 3 this is let's say
1:25:56
x-axis y ais z ais okay right now to show you because we can only look at 3D
1:26:01
I'm showing you three dimensional but in reality it can be n dimensional which is n is a very large number okay so we take
1:26:08
words we take sentences Then we generate vectors from these sentences. Vector is this like this
1:26:14
point right? And then what we do is we keep on generating these vectors.
1:26:23
Just a moment.
1:26:30
Yes. So we keep on generating these vectors and the beauty of these vectors is that somehow
1:26:39
when you search for cat and when you search for lion lion okay because these belong to a same
1:26:47
family they are going to be very closer to each other
1:26:53
right? When you plot something like a pat it is going to be much closer but
1:26:59
when you go ahead and plot something like a table then it is going to be far from cat.
1:27:06
So mathematically computer scientist has been able to create this vector thing. So what this
1:27:12
vector thing does is it will take a sentence or a piece of information. It
1:27:17
will convert it into a numerical identity which is a vector and then these vectors are created in such a way
1:27:23
that if you go ahead and compare these vectors with other words based on the
1:27:29
distance you will understand how much this word is similar to that word or not in the meaning
1:27:34
right. So this is vector embedding. Okay. So what is happening here? We have
1:27:42
had the content and the text. We have converted them into long sentences of vector embedding which is numerical
1:27:48
numbers. Okay. Now what happens? And then we are going to store these
1:27:54
vector embeddings into a vector database. Right? So now we have the data ready. We
1:28:00
have data ready to be searched. So now what will happen whenever
1:28:07
just a moment where is that? Yes. So this is rag.
1:28:15
Look at this very carefully everyone. So there are two parts of rag. First we are creating the knowledge base. What we
1:28:20
have done is we have taken all the content whether it is text, PDF, transcript code or any Bloomberg data.
1:28:27
We have converted that into small small chunks, small information of data and
1:28:32
after that we have created vector embeddings and then once we have created vector embeddings understand there are
1:28:38
standard programming code or functions to create these vector embeddings.
1:28:44
Okay, once the vectors embeddings are created they are stored in vector storage. There are multiple databases
1:28:50
that give you by default vector storing which is pine cone, superbase, AWS S3,
1:28:57
vector storage. It gives you all of that. Okay. Now what happens? A user
1:29:03
gives a query. The query is how has Tesla performed in the last quarter? Okay. Now what will happen?
1:29:11
This query would be converted into an embedding. It will again be converted into vector. Now
1:29:17
what will happen? We have two vectors. One is the vectors that are stored. Other is this vector. So if we want to
1:29:24
see what are the vectors which are similar to this vector which is where this information is stored. Right? Where
1:29:30
is that let's say what where is that I would say wardrobe or where is that
1:29:36
place where where in my kitchen the sugar might be stored. Okay. So it is
1:29:42
going to go ahead and understand this embedding and then you are going to search for things which are similar to
1:29:49
this embedding in this database. Okay. And you are going to pick maybe 1
1:29:55
2 3 5 10 things based on your algorithm based on your needs which are most
1:30:01
similar to this particular vector. So you will have things which are most similar to this particular vector. Then
1:30:07
what you will do is you will have some information. The information is you will go ahead and get this information and
1:30:14
then this will be your final prompt. So now you have taken the vector you have found what are other similar vectors.
1:30:21
Now you have created a list of the vectors which you have found. Now finally you will get this.
1:30:29
Now finally you will have this. So you will give this prompt to the large
1:30:36
language model. Just a moment.
1:30:42
Yes, you will give this prompt to the large language model.
1:30:48
Please observe this very carefully. Answer the question using the context below. This is the context. So, chunk
1:30:54
one, chunk two, whatever has been retrieved from there. Whatever information, okay, that information in
1:31:00
the text form, it will be written there. Plus this is the question from the user which is the query which is this
1:31:08
how has Tesla performed in the last quarter right and then eventually you are going
1:31:13
to go ahead and get give this prompt to the large language model cloud
1:31:18
Germany or anything and then you are going to go ahead and get your answer. This is rag in a nutshell. So we first
1:31:24
create a vector knowledge base then we get a query. We match that query
1:31:31
for all the similar terms in the vector database. Then we get all the information. We create a prompt. Then we
1:31:36
send it to the LLM and then we get the answer. So now with rag what happens is
1:31:42
you do not have to store all this information into your model or in the context. You can just cherrypick the
1:31:49
information that is very relevant to that particular information the prompt and then you can get all the information
1:31:54
at once. Okay, everyone a quick yes or no if you
1:32:00
are able to understand this.
1:32:08
Amazing. Great. Super.
1:32:14
Yes, people are not able to understand. uh if you just go ahead and uh submit
1:32:19
the feedback form in the last like in the next 10 minutes I will give you the recording so that you can go ahead and
1:32:25
do a revision. Cool. Yes.
1:32:32
Cool. Uh guys, tokens and embeddings are different. Embedding is actually a
1:32:38
meaningful representation of that particular sentence. Okay. But token is
1:32:43
just let's say a vocabulary. Okay. It is just a numerical representation of
1:32:49
particular word. Okay. Now this is rag. Now in order to help you understand
1:32:55
better I have created a small app that I have white coded very recently. Let me
1:33:00
show it to you.
1:33:08
Yes. So this is a simple rag process visualizer which I created in just 10 minutes using
1:33:16
cursor and chat GPD. Okay. And in the program that we offer at LOPM, we are going to teach you how to do all of
1:33:21
this. Okay. So let me show you what happens in that. So I've told you that in DAG, what happens? You have a piece
1:33:28
of information. You first convert it into chunks, right? After that you
1:33:33
create embeddings. After that you convert it into and save it to vector.
1:33:39
And once the vector is created, you are going to write a query, you are going to write a query and then
1:33:46
from that query, you are going to match what are the matching chunks, how many chunks you want to match and then you
1:33:51
will go ahead and compose the query as in the prompt is going to be composed and then you will generate the answer.
1:33:57
Okay. So let us see how it works. So I will take this thing. So I have written like a this log a very long time ago. So
1:34:05
let me go ahead and do this. So I have taken this piece of information. Let's say till this I can
1:34:11
take any kind of information. I will go to this. I will paste this
1:34:17
content. Now the chunk size is 350 which is it is going to take 350 characters in a
1:34:24
particular chunk and the overlap of 80 which is the there would be overlap of
1:34:30
80 characters between the first and the second and the third chunk. Okay. So I will just go ahead and create chunk
1:34:36
document. Now look at this chunks are created. This is the first chunk. This is the
1:34:43
second chunk. This is the third chunk. This is the four chunks. Understand this
1:34:49
chunk was removed here. So it is in this detail 4,000 words guide setting the
1:34:54
context how to build then rather than how. Okay. So now there is overlap in this chunk. So 50 characters are over
1:34:59
overlapped so that all the chunks have a meaningful information. So now we have
1:35:04
created the chunks. Okay. So what is chunking? Breaking down
1:35:10
information into smaller parts so that they are meaningful and smaller enough. Okay. Understand? You cannot use the
1:35:16
same chunking method methodology for every application. If you're using rag
1:35:21
for code in order to retrieve code and in order to generate code the chunking has to be done mostly at the functional
1:35:27
level. If you are creating for a book then maybe it can be done at a chapter level. If you're doing it for a meeting
1:35:33
it can be done at a maybe uh at a paragraph level. So chunking depends upon the product that you are creating
1:35:39
and tomorrow I'm going to tell you an evaluation that is how to decide your chunking strategy. Okay. So this is
1:35:44
chunk. Now I will create embeddings. I'll create on embeddings and then the embeddings are created.
1:35:50
Okay. So if I look at this these are the embeddings guys. These are the embeddings. Okay. Okay. So
1:35:56
for every chunk I have created vector embeddings. Okay. And this graph that you are able to see let me zoom it up a
1:36:04
bit. So this graph that you are able to see
1:36:10
is a representation of the vector. Now I will press the next button
1:36:16
to save to vector DB and then it will be saved locally. Okay. This is not connected to any server. So this is
1:36:22
going to be saved locally. And after this,
1:36:29
yes. And after this I will write a query. The query is
1:36:37
what is AI product management.
1:36:43
Okay. And I want to retrieve three chunks. Retrieve relevant chunks. And
1:36:48
then these are the chunks. So these chunks because there is product
1:36:54
management and all it is is being accessed here. So these are the most relevant piece of information that I
1:37:00
need to store here. So this is chunk number eight, chunk number two, chunk number three. If I click on this, I'll be able to see the complete chunk. Okay,
1:37:08
this is the cosine which is how distant these things are from each other and
1:37:13
from my vector. Okay. And then eventually what I'll do is I'll just create on compost query.
1:37:21
Now the query is composed. And this is the query. Answer the following query based on only the
1:37:27
provided data. User query. What is data product management? What is I product management? And these are
1:37:33
these are the chunks three chunks. Okay. And then when I click on this,
1:37:39
this will be sent to a large language model and then I'll get the answer. But I have not connected the LM because I don't want to pay. And then we have this
1:37:46
answer. Okay. But I can always go ahead and put my open AI key here API key in order to do this. Then the answer would
1:37:53
be generated. Okay. Everyone tell me on a scale of 1 to five if you're able to understand rag
1:38:00
now. Cool.
1:38:12
Wonderful. People who are four, I would recommend you to watch the recording once more and
1:38:18
then you'll be able to understand. Yes.
1:38:25
Cool. So, this was about rag. Super important concept everyone needs to understand. It will also improve your
1:38:30
problem solving capabilities. Now, the next part is prompt engineering. Okay. So guys, I'll
Prompt Engineering Essentials
1:38:37
only take 10 more minutes and then I will share the feedback form. So if you
1:38:42
have been here in this session for so long, please remain for another 10 minutes so that we can share the feedback form and you can learn the
1:38:48
prompt engineering as well. Okay.
1:38:55
Yes. Cool. So now we'll talk about prompting.
1:39:02
So understand guys, you need to understand how to give
1:39:07
instructions to your model. In order to give the right data, you have understood you have to use rag.
1:39:14
But in order to give instructions, you need to understand that you need to learn prompt engineering. Prompt engineering, no matter what the world
1:39:21
says, it is a super important skill in today's world. Okay? because you are
1:39:27
using let's say AI and LLMs for so much of your time in a day. It is worth
1:39:34
investing a couple of hours in order to learn prompt engineering and also if you are working as a product manager as an
1:39:41
AI product manager prompt engineering is your way to interact with the LLMs.
1:39:47
Okay. So it is worth investing few hours of your time in order to build great products. Okay. So this is also a guide
1:39:53
on prompt engineering. So understand this products such as Fireflaws, Firefly, Gong, Granola which are almost
1:40:00
a billion dollar companies or at least multi-million dollar companies. They are based on these kind of prompts. So you
1:40:05
should know how to learn these prompts and I'm going to go ahead and give you some I'll also share this guide with
1:40:11
you. But right now let me share with you few tips to improve the prompt.
1:40:17
Okay. So right now everyone tell me out of 1 to5 how would you rate
1:40:23
yourself on your prompt engineering skills? How would you rate yourself on a scale of 1 to five on your prompt
1:40:28
engineering skills? Three. Don't give yourself three. Three is a very diplomatic answer.
1:40:44
Yes. Many modest answers. Yes. any reflective answers. Okay. So, first of
1:40:50
all is first is please take a step back. So, I'll not give you a very uh
1:40:55
exhaustive guide that you're not able to even read. I'll give you a very simple guide and
1:41:01
this guide follows the parto principle. If you invest what is like if you learn these 20% of the skills as a prompt
1:41:08
engineer 80% of your efforts like problems are going to get solved. The first piece of advice is please take a
1:41:15
step back. Okay, understand the value of prompts.
1:41:21
What happens is the unfortunate reality is that when you go to chat GPT or
1:41:28
Gemini when you give it an very awful prompt, it will still be able to give
1:41:34
you an answer most of the time because it has given you an answer. Okay, answer
1:41:39
you go ahead and move forward from there and then you start working on whatever you are working on. Okay. But understand
1:41:45
always remember in many phrases in many places in your
1:41:51
life good
1:41:56
can be the enemy of best. Okay. In many places in your life
1:42:03
good can be the enemy
1:42:09
of best. which means you have to understand and recognize what is the
1:42:15
value of this task and is it worth investing a couple of more minutes or five seven more minutes in order to
1:42:21
write this prompt well. Okay. So the first advice that I have for you is please take a step back and understand
1:42:27
if it is worth investing time in that particular prompt if it is giving you that many results. Okay. The second part
1:42:33
is right role. Whenever you go ahead and start using an NLM please try to give it a role. role means try to say it, try to
1:42:40
tell it that act as a person with 160
1:42:46
plus IQ or act as a seasoned product manager or act as someone who is a seasoned
1:42:54
psychological therapist. Right? So give these personas to the LLM so that it is
1:43:00
able to perform well. If you want to experiment, you can share two prompts with chat GPT or china or anything. In
1:43:06
one give a very like give it a very solid persona in one don't give it a persona. You'll be able to observe the
1:43:12
answers. Right? So the first piece of advice is please give it a right. The second piece
1:43:18
of advice is please write the output expectation. Output expectation as in
1:43:25
you want JSON as an output. You want a table. You want to make sure that these
1:43:30
mistakes are not repeated. Please write it explicitly. You have to be very very specific. If you're not specific, it is
1:43:36
going to do anything and then you cannot go ahead and control it. Right? The third part is multistep. Multistep means
1:43:44
rather than telling your large language model to give you answer at once, ask it to think in a step and give you a
1:43:50
step-by-st answer. If you know the step, you can tell it the step. If you do not know the step, go ahead and ask it to
1:43:56
tell you the step. For example, rather than asking chat GPD that how would I improve this product LinkedIn, I would
1:44:02
ask it that I want to improve LinkedIn. Please follow these steps in order to suggest me the improvements. First
1:44:08
understand who are the different users. Then understand their important problems. Then give me what are the uh
1:44:15
what are the top priorized three problems. Then give me the solution of these problems. Then prioritize these
1:44:20
problems and prioritize the solution and then give me a particular solution. Now when you are focus like forcing chat GPD
1:44:26
to work in this manner you are more probably like to get a better answer. Okay. So please do the thinking. Let it
1:44:34
do the thinking in multiple steps. Okay. After this give examples. This is also
1:44:39
called as few short prompting. Few short prompting means you are giving
1:44:45
it few examples. You are giving it few examples that this
1:44:51
is the format that you should follow or these are the examples that make sure that you are able to go ahead and get the right content. Right? And then we
1:44:58
have constraints. So in example what you can do is whenever you are writing any
1:45:04
piece of blog or any piece of article that you want to learn from
1:45:09
go ahead copy the best author that you know copy their blog and then give it to
1:45:15
Chad Gigi. Okay. For example, what I do is whenever I write some piece of content because I have put a lot of
1:45:22
efforts in writing this particular guide, I copy this guide and I go to chat GPT and I ask that go ahead. So let
1:45:29
me show it to you. So this is Chad GPT. I am asking Chad
1:45:35
GPT to write a detailed article on AI
1:45:44
on mistakes that people make while learning
1:45:51
AI product management.
1:45:57
Right now we will see the output.
1:46:05
Yes. So you can see that it is writing. It is doing like a pretty interesting job, right?
1:46:16
In the meanwhile, I'll also open a new chat.
1:46:26
Right? So it has written this. You can see that it is uh well created. This is point number one. Point number two,
1:46:32
point number three, four, this, this, this, this, this. Right? I'm still
1:46:38
writing. Right? This is good one. Right? Now, what I'll do is I will copy this article.
1:46:46
I will copy this complete article. Maybe a Ctrl C.
1:46:57
Right. So, okay. First I'll go to this
1:47:10
then I will write. So I've written the sim similar prompt. Now I'm writing make sure to follow the similar
1:47:20
structure
1:47:26
voice and helpfulness. from this example.
1:47:34
Okay. And I can go ahead and either I can go ahead and uh give it the link. It will be able to crawl the link or I can
1:47:40
just go ahead to be assured I can go ahead and give it
1:47:47
this content. Okay. So now I have given an example. Let us
1:47:52
see how it works.
1:48:01
Yes. Now you look at this. Okay. Rather than straight away jumping to what you
1:48:08
should do, what you should not do, rather than straight away jumping to actionable, it is first setting the context. Why do you need this? This is a
1:48:15
quick context and then it is able to give you multiple mistakes and then how you can
1:48:21
go ahead and avoid these mistakes. Right? This is a slightly better
1:48:27
structure than you could have got in the first way. So this is called as few
1:48:32
short prompting where you give examples to your large language model as in how
1:48:37
they should operate. Right? And the other part is the similar example
1:48:44
which is constraints. Please give constraints. Constraint as in be helpful like this. Okay. Or
1:48:52
constraint as in if you want constraint in terms of what do we call it? If you want large
1:48:59
language model to not do something then you should always include them as explicit constraints. Okay. For example,
1:49:06
sometimes large language models assume a lot. Large language models actually
1:49:12
assume a lot. Large language models assume a lot. So
1:49:17
you can go ahead and tell them that please do not assume only take check the information that is available in this
1:49:23
context that I have shared with you. Similarly, you'll understand more about constant when we talk about iteration.
1:49:28
So understand prompt engineering is called engineering. Prompt engineering is called engineering because it is
1:49:35
iterations which is you tweak your way around. You give it a prompt. You understand that I
1:49:42
got the output but the output does not follow these rules or the output is not
1:49:47
good in this particular way. So you are going to understand the output and then you are going to give it the constraint
1:49:52
that boss make sure that you are not taking unnecessary assumptions. Make sure that you are not using examples
1:49:59
which are let's say very much vague or generic. Use specific examples. Okay. So
1:50:05
when you go ahead and apply all of these steps and when you keep on iterating
1:50:10
on top of all of these six steps you are going to learn how to design better
1:50:16
products. Okay. Now even after I give you all of this I know that most of the people are
1:50:22
lazy and they are not going to follow this. So now I'm going to give you a prompt guide for busy people. Okay. So
Guide to Prompt Engineering for Busy People
1:50:28
four things that everyone should learn and then we are going to wrap up the session. First is please build a prompt
1:50:33
directory. Whenever you come across good prompts have a notion document or a Google doc where you are storing all of
1:50:39
these things. Okay? So that you don't have to find your way through good prompts every time. Right? Second is
1:50:45
quick shortcuts. Okay? Keep a bookmark where you are able to access this
1:50:51
library as soon as possible. So what I do is whenever I want to write something I do not want to find a writing pad.
1:50:57
What I do is I just click on this new tab and then I have all of my notes from notion available here.
1:51:05
Okay, Chrome new tab is the name of the extension and then it is going to load here. Right now I think notion is down so it is not loading but now it has
1:51:11
loaded. Okay, so all of my notes and everything is here. So what I've done is
1:51:16
I have set up a Chrome extension where whenever I click on this new tab button it will automatically load my dashboard.
1:51:22
so that I don't have to run here and there. I can just go ahead and click on this and then I can start writing my notes and my prompt directory is also
1:51:28
there. Right? The other piece of advice is use a
1:51:34
prompt manager. Okay? So there are multiple prompt managers. You can use any one of them. And you can also use
1:51:41
this prompt wild card. Okay. If you are too lazy to write your own prompt, you can also get this wild card which is
1:51:47
analyze the following prompt idea. Analyze the following prompt idea.
1:51:53
Insert prompt here. Rewrite the prompt for clarity and effectiveness. Identify potential improvements or additions.
1:51:59
Refine the prompt based on identified improvements. Present the final optimizing prompt. Okay. And also there
1:52:05
is a prompt creator from anthropic. Okay. So there
1:52:11
is a prompt creator called as anropic
1:52:19
prompt creator. Okay, where you can go ahead and create prompts. So it would be
1:52:27
somewhere or have to login in order to see this. But you should be able to go ahead and generate this from cloud console.
1:52:34
Okay. Once you log in, it will give you a prompt uh creator so that you can go ahead and create your own prompts which are much better than what you would have
1:52:40
gone ahead and written by yourself. Okay. So this is about
1:52:46
the guide to prompt engineering for busy people. Now in tomorrow's session what we'll do is we will talk about notebook
1:52:54
LM how does it works. We will talk take the similar kind of case studies. We'll detail it enough. Then we'll talk about
1:53:00
fine-tuning. Then we'll talk about how to choose between fine-tuning, prompt engineering and rag. And then we'll talk
1:53:06
about AI agents. Then I'll give you how products such as lovable, bolt, emergent, and visero works. And then we
1:53:13
are going to go ahead and talk about MCPS. And then eventually I'll give you some examples of how to write AI
1:53:19
evaluations. Okay, this is going to be tomorrow. But guys understand whatever I'm telling you in these two sessions
1:53:26
this is just 10% of what we offer in our bigger program at hello. Okay. So at
1:53:32
hello we have created the world's most detailed AI product management program.
1:53:39
Okay. If you want to understand anything about the program just go to this website called hellopm.co
1:53:44
click on this video and then I'll explain you what that content is. Okay. This is the most detailed, the most
1:53:51
practical and the most long-term support AI product management program that you can find. The content that I've told you
1:53:56
today is just 10% of what we teach in the program just in the first two classes. We will make sure that tomorrow
1:54:01
you'll get a much more power pack session. So thank you everyone. Bye and
1:54:07
take care. If you have any queries, you can use the same form to publish these queries. Tomorrow we are going to meet at the same time. Make sure that you
Session Recap and Audience Engagement
1:54:13
also go ahead and bring your friends. Thank you everyone. Bye and take care. You have been a great audience. I hope you got some value from this session and
1:54:19
the two hours that you have invested. We'll meet everyone tomorrow. Thank you everyone. Take care. Today is the day
1:54:26
two of AI product management masterass and we are going to give you almost
Introduction to AI Product Management Masterclass
1:54:32
everything that you need to get started in your journey as an AI product manager. This is the foundation. Now you
1:54:39
can go ahead and explore the whole canvas in order to go into detail. But these are the major building blocks that
1:54:45
you need to absolutely know if you really want to call yourself as an AI product management enthusiast. Right?
1:54:52
And because AI product management is so new, even if you are coming from a very senior background or you are just
1:54:58
aspiring to be a product manager just straight out straight out of college, this content is going to be equally
1:55:04
useful for you. So yesterday what we have done, we have talked about the agenda. I talked to you about what is
1:55:09
the GI revolution. lot of companies are building value on the top of this geni revolution then even in our normal lives
1:55:16
AI has found its way right yes
1:55:23
cool I will stop the chat for some time so that you guys are not getting distracted
1:55:29
yes cool so AI has also found the way
1:55:34
onto our daily lives and almost every day we are using chat GPT or Gemini or some of the other AI tools tools in
1:55:41
order to make ourselves more productive and grow the impact of our work. Right? And then I talked about the most
1:55:49
fundamental unit why this AI boom has started which is because of a particular
Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)
1:55:54
technology called large language models. These large language models, these large language models are algorithms that are
1:56:02
trained on massive amount of text and they have learned the patterns of language really well and they are now
1:56:09
acting as the brain of the computers. And now what is happening? They are enabling us to understand, generate and
1:56:16
reason with natural language by predicting the next token most likely or the token in the context. And I have told you yesterday how all of these
1:56:22
things actually work. I have given you the whole architecture of what an LLM is. The content is like you will go
1:56:28
ahead and take all the content as a training data from the internet. You will break it down into input and output. Then you are going to tokenize
1:56:36
it. You are going to send the input from here. The neural network or the transformer is going to predict the next
1:56:42
token. And then whatever is the right token from the uh training data, you are going to compare it. Then whatever is
1:56:48
the difference, the feedback is going to be sent to the transformer again. And then it will keep on iterating. When this cycle happens billions and
1:56:54
trillions of time, you will have a very mature model, right? But this model is
1:57:00
only a base model. It is trained on some random data from the internet. So it it
1:57:06
has certain kind of biases. It hallucinates a lot. So what we do is we go ahead and do something called as post
1:57:12
training. Questioning means we are going to have some human labelers or we are going to have some data analytors who
1:57:18
are going to give some specific input and output maybe in this particular
1:57:24
format. Wait.
1:57:32
Yes. Maybe in this particular format where we are going to insert this kind of data
1:57:39
like well articulated inputs and well articulated outputs so that the human can the uh uh algorithm can go ahead and
1:57:47
learn from the same. Okay. This is called a supervised learning. And one part of that learning is also called
1:57:52
reinforcement learning through human feedback which is humans are telling how what is correct and what is incorrect.
1:57:59
Right? Humans are reinforcing the correct things by giving the rewards to the LLM. Now after that
1:58:05
we talk about the genai value stack. So there is multiple kind of values. For example there are companies who are
1:58:11
creating infrastructure such as these big Nvidia and Google. Then there are company who are creating the models. You
1:58:16
know about anthropic and open AI. Then there are companies who are building on top of these large language models. This
1:58:23
is where most of the value unlock is. And then we have companies and people who are actually using these AI tools in
1:58:29
order to make their clients happy, solve their problems and also solve their own problems. Right? And then I discussed
1:58:37
about type of AI PMs. Everyone who is using AI is AI enabled PM AI tools such as chat GPD and all. Anyone who is using
AI Product Management Roles and Responsibilities
1:58:43
AI tools is a AI enabled PM. And then we have other type of PM which are more serious PMs. These are PMs who are
1:58:50
either working on core technologies such as databases, models, infrastructure and then there are people who are working on
1:58:56
the application layer and these are people who are actually using these LLMs and models and everything in order to
1:59:01
build some truly AI products. Agents are one of the examples. Chat GP is one of the examples. Grammarly is one of the
1:59:08
example. Lovable is one of the examples. So if you are building these products not building with these product you are
1:59:13
building these products then you are an applied AIPM and the purpose of this session is to help you understand the
1:59:19
core AIPM part and the applied AIPM part. Okay, for this part we have already uploaded a lot of content
1:59:25
on our YouTube channel that you can see right then
1:59:31
I talked about how this application these meeting
1:59:36
assistant such as granola works okay and not only granola but if you take any of the meeting assistant such as fireflies
Building AI-Powered Meeting Assistants
1:59:42
fed them or anything everyone works in a similar format the format is whenever you want to
1:59:49
create a product as a product manager manager understand please do not look only from the engineering or the AI
1:59:55
angle. You are the product manager who is responsible to bring the user outcomes and the business outcomes. So
2:00:02
please look at these five things. The first thing is what is the value that is being generated for the users? Why would
2:00:08
the users use it? Second is what is the business value that is generated. Then there is how do you make design so
2:00:14
intuitive that people are able to use it easily and then how it is feasible with the help of engineering. So all the
2:00:21
system architecture is going to come here and then growth and adoption. In granular we knew that this product helps
2:00:27
us save time by recording our meetings and sending us the summary. How does it
2:00:33
helps a business? The business should invest in granular in creating granular because there is a large opportunity in
2:00:39
meeting apps. So it is going to make money. Similarly, how do we make this intuitive to the users? By making the
2:00:45
design very intuitive. How do we make it intuitive? We make the design intuitive by making sure that just after logging
2:00:52
and connecting connecting granular fireflies. You don't have to do anything. Whenever a meeting is
2:00:57
scheduled, it is automatically going to join that meeting. It is automatically going to generate the summary. It is
2:01:02
automatically going to send the summary to everyone who was invited to that meeting. Right? With just few clicks,
2:01:07
you should be able to do so without your involvement. So that is the intuitiveness. Similarly, how will this
2:01:13
be engineered? So I have told you about this. So let's say Zoom and Google meet or any
2:01:18
kind of platform is the place where you are conducting this meeting. Then Fireflies or granola
2:01:26
is going to either use the API for Zoom or Google or they are going to do the
2:01:33
audio capture through a bot. Okay, like you can see that there are a lot of bots in this meeting who are actually
2:01:40
recording the meeting on the behalf of their administrators. Right? After that that audio is captured and then there
2:01:46
are tools called as audio to text transcription machine learning models. Right? These models such as whisper by
2:01:54
open AAI, speech to text by Google, they are going to convert the audio into text
2:02:00
transcription right and then you are going to attach a system prompt. So you
2:02:05
as a product manager of granular is going to add a system prompt and then you are going to add a transcript. Let
2:02:10
me show you that system prompt that I have shown you yesterday.
2:02:17
So this is the prompt that you will paste. The prompt is very simple. You are an expert chief of staff and note
2:02:23
taker given the following things. Please go ahead and summarize the summary of the please go ahead and
2:02:28
summarize the given transcript in this particular format. Right? So now what will happen? We have
2:02:34
this sub we have the system prompt and then the system prompt is going to
2:02:39
be combined with the transcript and then it will be sent to large language models
2:02:45
such as Gemini or Google Gemini or open uh open AI's APIs right understand this
2:02:51
is happening at the back end you do not know what is happening you are just using granular at the back end granular is doing all of this and then it will
2:02:57
generate the summary actionables and the task and you can take a next step you can make it into an agent
2:03:03
by actually sending the tasks on a calendar on your Jira or on your slack.
2:03:10
So this is how any application which is a note takingaking assistant can work right even if you go ahead and
2:03:17
understand a bit of by coding you can also go ahead and create your own personal AI meeting assistant. This is
2:03:24
the simplest architecture that teams use, right? And after that we talk about a very important part that yes in this
2:03:32
example we were able to work with prompt engineering but how do we go ahead and
Context Engineering and RAG Models
2:03:37
build applications which are able to work on the large set of data such as data which is on your
2:03:44
Jira dashboard, data which is on notion AI, data which is on stripe.
2:03:50
So what we do is we cannot let's say I have a notion database I want to ask
2:03:56
some questions on the top of the database. So I cannot just go ahead and put all of these content in the text in the context. Why? Because the LLM is
2:04:03
going to go out of context and then there are researches that are conducted which have proven that with increasing
2:04:10
context the accuracy of the LLM incre decreases. With increasing context, the
2:04:15
accuracy of the LLM decreases. And after this, we talked about the simple thing that if you have if you are working with
2:04:22
LLMs, try to make your inputs concise otherwise they can go ahead and hallucinate too much and they are going
2:04:29
to run out of context and give you irrelevant answers. And then we presented you to con context
2:04:35
engineering. In context engineering, we first talk about rag. So what is rag?
2:04:41
Super simple. What we do is rather than putting all the documents let's say I want to build
2:04:48
a functionality where on my notion document or on my Google drive I ask a
2:04:53
question that what is the main what are the tasks that I need to
2:04:59
do tomorrow okay and somewhere in one of the PRDs one of the documents it is
2:05:05
written that I have to do these tasks tomorrow okay so in a non ideal scenario what will happen I will try to get all
2:05:11
the content of the Google Drive I will put it in the LLM context of the LLM and then I'll ask the question among all of
2:05:18
this content what is something that I need to do tomorrow okay and then what will happen because it is lot of content
2:05:23
the LM the LLM is going to run out of context so what we'll do is rather than
2:05:30
going ahead and taking all the data at once to the LLM we are going to only find the content that is relevant right
2:05:36
so what we do in the what we do here
2:05:42
We simply go ahead. We simply go ahead first whatever data
2:05:48
that we have we break that data. We break that data into chunks.
2:05:54
And after chunking the data into small enough and meaningful chunks, we are
2:06:00
going to convert it into vector embeddings. And after we have converted into vector embeddings, we are going to store in a vector storage. Once the
2:06:07
vectors are stored, we will go ahead and get the user prompt, find all the relevant content from the vector
2:06:12
storage, then convert it into text and then ask this question to the LLM that
2:06:19
based on these information please try to answer this question and then it will give you answer answer the question from
2:06:24
the limited context that you have given. Right? And I have also shown you a visual example with a rag model that we
2:06:31
have created like a rag vibe app that we have created. Right? So this is about rank
2:06:39
and then we talked about prompt engineering. Okay, I have shared
Prompt Engineering Tips and Techniques
2:06:45
with you some very simple but very effective tips which is try to understand the value of prompt engineering. Make sure that you are
2:06:51
giving it the right role so that it is more authoritative and you are getting the right answers. Then mention the
2:06:57
output expectation very clearly. give it do something called as chain prompting where you are going to mention ask the
2:07:04
LLM to think in steps so that it is able to go ahead and give you what is the reason behind this thinking and then
2:07:09
give examples this is called as few short prompting when you don't give example it is zero short prompting when
2:07:15
you give example it is few short prompting right and then mention the constraints understand all of this is
2:07:20
called as iterations because once you give it a prompt you will understand that maybe there is something missing I
2:07:25
should have mentioned this clearly and then you are going to iterate on the prompt and then you'll understand what are the constraints that you need to put
2:07:31
okay and then I have shared with you some advices and some wild card prompts
2:07:36
so that you can go ahead and get better at prompt engineering and writing better prompts right understand prompts are
2:07:42
your doorway to seize this AI opportunity right it is not just plain
2:07:48
English you need to go ahead and think deeper about the prompts so as to get the better answers right you have a very
2:07:56
o uh a very obedient and a very powerful individual at your disposal. If you ask
2:08:03
it like uh awful questions, you are going to get awful answers. Now it's your responsibility to make sure that you're asking it better kind of
2:08:09
questions. Right? Yes. So this is what we have done so far. I think we have spent 15 minutes just in the revision.
2:08:15
Now everyone please tell me go ahead in the chat if you have understood everything so far. How many of you are
2:08:21
aware about this product called as notebook? So in case someone has not used I'll
2:08:27
just give you a glimpse. Okay. So let's say I want to learn about AI product
2:08:32
management. Okay. This is the topic for today. But sadly I do not have time. I do not
2:08:38
want to invest time. So what I'll do is I'll go to this platform notebook.google.com. Okay. I will click on new notebook.
2:08:46
Right? And now what I can do is I can give it lot of documents, lot of resources and then I can ask questions
2:08:55
and summarize these documents from this interface right on chat GBT when you give so many
2:09:01
document documents it runs out of context but it is this particular platform notebook is working on rag that
2:09:07
I have just told you so it will be able to answer let me show you how it works okay so let's say I want to understand about a IML product management so I'm
2:09:14
going to insert some resources okay so the resources At hello PM we have gone ahead and done
2:09:20
something called as the AI sprint which has everything that you need to understand as an AI product manager. So
2:09:28
I will click on this.
2:09:38
Yeah. So I'll click on my channel and then I'll click on playlist and then
2:09:43
I'll click on the AI sprint and then okay so this is one video. So what I'll
2:09:49
do is I'll copy the URL. I will go to notebook. I am now collecting the resources. Okay. So my
2:09:55
resource are these URLs. So I'll click on YouTube. I will paste the URL here.
2:10:01
Insert. So this would be inserted in some time. Second. So now what is happening the Google uh uh Google
2:10:09
notebook alm is actually taking the transcript of the video it is breaking
2:10:14
the transcript into small small parts and then it is vectorizing all of these transcripts okay all of the contents out
2:10:22
there. Second, I will take maybe uh uh the second
2:10:28
video.
2:10:33
I will put it again in the YouTube part. Insert. Now I want a blog. So a IML
2:10:42
this. So I've written a blog as well. So I will go ahead and just
2:10:47
add it here. And then I would put a link of website.
2:10:53
I can put multiple URLs as well. Okay. So now I have all of this context ready. These are long 1 and a half hour 2 hours
2:11:00
videos and this is a very long I would say 3 4,000 words of vlogs. Okay. So now
2:11:06
you understand that yes I have all the context available. I can go ahead and ask it any kind of question and then
2:11:11
these questions would be answered from the data that I have given. Right? So I will ask a question how do I
2:11:19
what skill does a
2:11:24
AI product manager needs. Now this answer would be grounded in
2:11:31
what is written in these sessions. Right? So if you want to do any research of the world you can just catch up some
2:11:38
YouTube videos, some interesting podcasts from the founders and industry leaders. put up some blogs, put up some
2:11:43
reports in PDFs from Mackenzie and other companies and then you should be able to do this. Okay, now it has given me the
2:11:49
answer. But this is not the beauty. This is okay. This is cool. But it also has some wonderful features which is it can
2:11:56
help me create mind map. Right? So if I click on this, it will create a beautiful mind map from all the
2:12:01
concepts. Okay. Another important part is reports. So if I click on the reports,
2:12:07
these are all the report that it will create. It will create a complete blog post which I can read. It will create a
2:12:13
study guide so that it will be having a short answer, quizzes, some uh revision material, everything. Then a briefing
2:12:19
doc so that I can go ahead and just understand what is important in these particular three four resources. And then there are multiple things. Okay,
2:12:27
concept explainer, process overview and everything. So it is now able to understand the content and based on
2:12:33
content it is suggesting me that this kind of reports are possible from this and I can also give my own report right.
2:12:40
So let's say I want to get a briefing.
2:12:46
So now it will take some time in order to generate this particular report. Okay. And then I can also go ahead and
2:12:53
create mindm flashcards quiz and everything. And also eventually I can also create an audio overview. Okay. So
2:12:59
this is what this product does. This is almost a number one research tool based
2:13:04
on AI which almost every product manager and every individual should use. Okay.
2:13:10
So this is notebook LM for you. There are so many use cases. You just think about it and notebook LM should be able to do these things. Right. So my
2:13:17
recommendation to everyone would be that after this session go ahead and try to play around with notebook. Super helpful
2:13:23
tool. Right? Yes. Everyone a quick yes or no if you're able to understand this
2:13:28
tool.
2:13:35
Amazing. Thank you. Yes. So now let us try to understand and also
2:13:43
what I'm telling you is not just how notebook LM works but also any of the
2:13:49
tools any of the AI tools which are based on documents. So in notebook we
2:13:54
are giving it a lot of documents and transcripts and it is working on the same. On notion AI we are actually
2:13:59
giving it all of our databases the notion document that we have created it is working on the same in Salesforce
2:14:05
Einstein we have all the document that we have created in our salesforce all the sales record all the CRM all the
2:14:10
emails all the customer conversations and then there is an LLM on top of it. So the mental model is that if you have
2:14:15
a lot of data and if you want to put a LLM on top of it in order to make it more
2:14:21
queryable with the help of a natural language then this is what you should do. This is the same architecture for all of these products. Okay. Yeah. So
2:14:28
what we do is we follow the same format. Question
2:14:34
number one is what problem does it solve in people lives? This is something that you need
2:14:41
to answer as a product manager before even building the product. So why does notebook help why is notebook helping
2:14:46
helpful? Because it helps people conduct research by helping them read so many documents
2:14:52
and summarize these documents at once. It helps people read and learn about
2:14:57
exhaustive full topics within a lot less period of time.
2:15:03
It also helps people create some effective nodes for their learning, for
2:15:08
their research, for building any product or for doing anything. Okay. So, there is definitely a value in the product,
2:15:16
right? So, it will help people become more productive and take better decisions in shorter period of time,
2:15:22
right? What is the business value? Now Google has understood that people are using chat GPD a lot and Google has
2:15:30
understood that now if people keep on using chat GP and perplexity the research that people used to do on
2:15:36
Google is now going to get reduced. So they have to create a product that will make sure that they are getting their
2:15:43
lost foothold. And now notebook alum has become popular that people are have started using it. So it is a strategic
2:15:49
bet for Google to create this kind of product. Right. Third is how do we make
2:15:54
it intuitive to use? So Google has made it very simple. So you can see the UI. It is very simple. It tells you. So
2:16:02
Google might have thought that why not we go ahead and allow people to just enter content. Okay. But content could
2:16:08
also be in the form of YouTube. So they explicitly mentioned that yes people want to learn from YouTube so you can
2:16:13
enter YouTube. People want to upload their PDFs. So they are allowing you to upload the PDFs. So they understood that
2:16:19
from what kind of resources people would want to ideally get the information and they have enlisted all these resources.
2:16:26
Similarly they were able to understand that most of the people are very lazy in terms of prompt engineering. So they are
2:16:32
giving you some automatic templates of reports. So rather than you thinking that what is the question that I asked
2:16:38
from this document they will give you automated question in the form of report that I have just shown you.
2:16:44
Right? So this is how you make the product more intuitive. Right? And if you guys want to learn how to make the
2:16:49
product more intuitive, a simple exercise is go ahead look at 10 top AI
2:16:55
products and then reverse engineer what are the things that they are doing in order to make it more intuitive. You can follow the similar kind of principles.
2:17:02
You will be ahead of 80% people who do not know anything about UI, right? And then we have how will this be
2:17:08
engineered, right? How will this be engineered? This is the structure. Please look at this very very carefully.
2:17:15
Okay. Yes, we have 510 people in the chat. Everyone please write focus if you are
2:17:22
ready to go through this. Please write focus if you are ready to go through this.
2:17:37
Amazing. Great. Cool. So focus here everyone. So here what is happening is
2:17:43
first is the resources. Resources are in the format of articles,
2:17:49
videos, PDFs and text which is videos it
2:17:55
will not be able to understand. So what it does is it takes a YouTube videos and YouTube videos comes with a transcript.
2:18:01
So it is understanding the transcript and not the video. Okay. Second is PDFs
2:18:08
to convert PDF into text. We can either if the PDF is created
2:18:13
digitally, we can go ahead and convert it into text like through some PDF extractors. However, if it is an image
2:18:19
that we have taken photos of and then we have converted the PDF, then we have something called as OCR or optical image
2:18:25
recognition, character recognition, right? So these things would be creative to understand it is not just that it
2:18:33
building an AI product is only about implementing the LLM. You have to do this dirty work as well which is making
2:18:39
sure that all the content is in the right format which is text right after this
2:18:47
after this and even if let's say we have audio
2:18:52
right now I don't think it allows audio but if it allows audio what it will do is it will get the audio from you it
2:18:58
will give it to the back end like from the back end it will give it to Google speechtoext API or whisper API and then
2:19:06
it is going to get the transcript and then the transcript is going to be added here. Okay. So as soon you add the
2:19:11
sources the sources are extracted they are chuned and then
2:19:18
they are chuned at two levels document level and the paragraph level. Right? So
2:19:23
it tells you that from which document and which part of document is this content coming from. So whenever you are
2:19:28
storing these chunks there would be a link to that document whole document like the source and there will also be a
2:19:34
link to that particular part of the document which is the chunk right I have shown you this example yesterday with
2:19:40
that thing right after this we have embedding so now this will be
2:19:47
stored in Google's own database for embedding and understand whenever you change the content whenever you update
2:19:52
the content this is going to get refreshed right till Here we have not used the
2:19:58
genai so far. We are only using engineering computer science engineering so far and some machine learning
2:20:05
algorithms. Right now what happens your platform notebook
2:20:13
is going to understand what this content is all about. So it will try to go ahead
2:20:19
and create highle summaries of all the documents that you have created like highle summary for every document automatically and then it will try to
2:20:25
understand what are the different kind of reports that I can generate and for generating these reports it would have
2:20:31
some kind of templates already. So let me show you
2:20:36
so this is what Google might have created at the back end. Okay. So let's say
2:20:42
if we think that there there could be a summary that we can create. So it will
2:20:48
go ahead and give this kind of prompt which is summarize the key ideas in the plain English focus on main findings and implications. if they need to create a
2:20:55
study guide. So here what is happening is we have these report prompts right it
2:21:00
will show you that these are the things that you can do with this report and then the user input whatever the user
2:21:06
has inputed the prompt and the retrieved context. Retrieve context means whatever
2:21:12
is matching with that prompt. Whatever the words that you have mentioned in that prompt, whatever is matching in the
2:21:19
vector database that is going to be fetched and then that is be that will be sent to the LLM. If it is Google, the
2:21:26
LLM is most probably going to be Gemini. So this is the prompt library. Okay. So if the summary type the report type is
2:21:32
summary, then this is the prompt. If it is a study guide, then generate a structured outline with key component,
2:21:38
definitions, and questions for self- testing. Right? Mind map. Organize the main ideas
2:21:45
hierarchically with branches for non for subconcepts and examples.
2:21:51
Right? And then reports would be generated and then
2:21:56
reports could be summary, mind web, guides, FAQs and then what will happen? You as a user will give you the feed will give the feedback that it is good
2:22:03
or it is bad and then it is going to go ahead and autocorrect these prompts and you can also go ahead and put your own
2:22:09
prompts. So what is happening this is
2:22:15
augmenting this part
2:22:21
is retrieval and this part is generation.
2:22:27
Right? So we are first creating the documents then we are generating then we are uh going ahead and giving it to the
2:22:33
LLM and then we are generating and going giving the output to the user right so this is how notebook LM works in a
2:22:40
nutshell it is a pure play rag application right everyone a quick yes
2:22:46
or no if you are able to understand
2:22:55
H now one question to everyone
2:23:01
question to everyone okay let's say if I ask the question to notebook alm
2:23:08
that summarize all the contents summarize
2:23:13
everything that you are like from all the resources summarize Now what do you think will happen? Think
2:23:20
about it for a moment and tell me in the chat what will happen then? Let's say if I give it a query, give me a summary of
2:23:26
this content. What will happen
2:23:37
now? So summarization. Yes. Cool. So understand summarization is a
2:23:45
non-typical task. Why? Because summarization
2:23:50
is the most I would say popular task but it is a non-trivial task. Because in the
2:23:57
prompt what would be mentioned? Summarize this document. When this is mentioned in the prompt
2:24:03
when it will search in the rag model when it will search in the embedding what will it search for? Summarize
2:24:09
article. And now how will it find that where is summarize and all because it is
2:24:14
doing a vector like search. So it might find some chunks where summarize brief
2:24:20
executive summary these kind of things are written but summary would not be accurate. Right? So what is the solution? The
2:24:26
solution is we do not implement this normal rag pipeline in these kind of applications. What we do is
2:24:35
we have something called as hierarchal hierarchal
2:24:40
rag. I'm not sure what the spelling is. So
2:24:47
hierarchal rag what it is is that I have source one,
2:24:54
I have source two, I have source three. Okay. So now first of all understand the
2:25:00
problem clearly. Okay, I have created chunks. Let's say there are 10 chunks
2:25:06
that are from this document. There are 10 chunks from this document and four chunks from this document. If I ask LLM
2:25:14
the question that please
2:25:19
summarize this, then what will happen? It will make the vector of summarize,
2:25:24
right? And summarize vector might be equal to brief.
2:25:30
Okay. or maybe some other things like synonyms of summarize right and it will go ahead
2:25:37
and try to find summarize brief and some things in these chunks and whatever whatever are the chunks that are relevant it will go ahead and give these
2:25:44
chunks let's say one chunk from here one chunk from here and one chunk from here so we have got three chunks
2:25:52
right but understand these chunks are incomplete they have mentioned summary or brief or in short something but they
2:26:00
do not contain the true summary they just contain these words
2:26:05
right. So what we will do here is we maintain a summary
2:26:12
we maintain a summary at a high level. So for all of these documents as soon as
2:26:18
you upload this document in notebook LM it is first going to generate the summary of the whole document. So it
2:26:24
will send it to the LLM. It will generate the complete summary
2:26:29
so that it understands what the report is. Then for the other it is going to generate the summary. For other it is going to generate the summary without
2:26:35
you saying anything. And then whenever you send a query of summary it will understand what the equation is. And
2:26:41
then it is going to answer by concatenating or copying or taking all
2:26:46
of these summaries into the context. That way context is also not increased but there would be some more LLM calls.
2:26:56
Right? So how we have solved this problem? We have taken all the sources automatically without even the user
2:27:03
saying so we have taken the summaries of every individual source.
2:27:08
Right? And once we got the summary from the LLM now whenever a user is asking question about summary we are going to combine all of these summaries in order
2:27:14
to get a better answer. Right? Yes, everyone a quick yes or no if
2:27:21
you're able to understand this and like this guys although rag is simple okay rag is not a
2:27:29
rocket science but you have to understand the nuances every product is
2:27:35
unique so you have to understand these kind of nuances before going ahead and calling yourself an AI product manager
2:27:42
okay so this is about how not works and all the rag applications works in the similar format you have the knowledge
2:27:48
base, you convert the knowledge base into the vector database. After that, you go ahead and get the user query, you
2:27:54
match the pattern, you get the uh uh top similar chunks and then you put the LLM
2:28:00
on top of it along with the system block. Right? Yes.
2:28:05
Now in the context engineering we have so far talked about rag we have talked about
Fine-Tuning Large Language Models
2:28:12
uh prompt engineering and the third part of context engineering is actually fine-tuning. So sometimes what happens
2:28:18
is sometimes what happens is you have to
2:28:24
retrain the model you have to change the parameters in the model for your use case. For example,
2:28:31
Google has this amazing model called as alpha. Okay, Google alpha and
2:28:40
Google alpha fold or something is the name alpha fold I think. Okay, so what it does is it is able to identify the
2:28:47
patterns in protein and then it is able to suggest that what is going to be let's say the consequences which is the
2:28:53
diseases which are identified from protein patterns and so many things. Okay, but understand when Chad GPT or
2:29:00
Gemini was trained, it does not have any information about proteins and all. It has the information about how normal
2:29:07
natural processing works, but it does not have any understanding about how to understand the protein models. Okay. So
2:29:12
now what happens is we are going to take some new data which
2:29:17
only contains information about these protein folds and then we are going to go ahead and retrain our large language
2:29:24
model again. So that now we have contextual information about this. So if there is some information that is
2:29:31
completely lacking that cannot be compensated with rag then we use
2:29:36
fine-tuning plus sometimes when you have to change the personality of the model for example this is a real use case that
2:29:43
one of the bigger banks they used chat GPT in order to answer the customer
2:29:49
queries right and then they were able to find that chat GP is able to answer well but it does not have that personality of
2:29:56
how their people were actually going ahead and answering. So what they did was they actually taken all of their
2:30:01
past records of the chat which humans have done they have fine-tuned GPT and
2:30:07
other models on the top of the same and then they were able to get a new model which is now able to act nicely right
2:30:14
similarly Bloomberg has created a product called as Bloomberg GPD where
2:30:19
they have trained complete Bloomberg on top of uh the a GPT on top of Bloomberg
2:30:25
data so that if it has that kind of context Right? It kind that kind of information and knowledge. So finetuning is adopting
2:30:33
a pre-trained large language model which is a chat GP or any base model with a domain specific data to make it more
2:30:39
useful for a particular task. Right? So what we do is we take a base model llama GT sonnet. Then we do the fine tuning
2:30:47
with curated data and examples and then we have a fine-tuned error. Okay. It is one line of code which you have to use
2:30:53
in the openi terminal. OpenAI API fine-tune create t data.json JSON
2:30:58
whatever the data that you have then this is the model that you want to train one line of code can go ahead and do the
2:31:03
finetuning but understand finetuning is the costliest of all the three method that we have talked about finetuning
2:31:11
takes a lot of money a lot of resources so unless you are not sure you should not start with finetuning first do
2:31:17
prompt engineering then try to understand if the problem can be solved with rag if it is lack of information
2:31:23
problem if it is not solved then you should go ahead and go to finetuning
2:31:30
Right. And generally finetuning is of two types.
2:31:35
One is full finetuning. Second is parameter efficient finetuning or PFP.
2:31:42
Okay. So in full finetuning what happens is whatever are the billion parameters that we have in the large language
2:31:47
models we are going to try to update them all. So it is very intensive right.
2:31:54
So this is going to give you great results but it is also going to be very very intensive on the CPU and GPU and it
2:32:01
is going to cost you a lot of money. Right? Similarly we have parameter efficient finetuning. Okay. Where what
2:32:08
we do is rather than so I have talked about parameters in the last class. In parameter efficient finetuning
2:32:15
rather than going ahead and uh uh optimizing and changing every parameter
2:32:22
we only change few parameters to make sure that middle model is able to get that behavior without spending a lot of
2:32:29
money on training right so it updates the subset of parameters it has lost cost and store
2:32:36
right and the f the training can be done faster the examples are adopters and lora
2:32:42
Right. So this is called as fine tuning in LMS. Now a major question is
2:32:49
when should I choose what to do whether I should do prompt engineering or rag or fine-tuning. How should I choose? So
2:32:56
this is a simple decision tree for you. Okay. If you want to decide the right contextualization method, this thing is
2:33:02
called contextualization or context engineering. If the base LLM is good
2:33:07
enough with careful prompting, then go with prompting. Experiment. Try with prompt first. Before going to advanced
2:33:14
method, try with prompt first. If it is giving you the answer, go ahead and do this. There are multiple products that are based on the same. For example,
2:33:20
granola and chat PD, they are only working on prompt engineering. Right? Second is if it is not working,
2:33:27
prompt is not enough. Then if the problem is only about missing or dynamic
2:33:32
knowledge then go ahead use rag is try notion AI notebook lm they are using rag
2:33:39
right and the third is if the issue is about style tone or a domain specific
2:33:45
behavior that you'll understand by asking questions to the LLM then you should go with this and examples are
2:33:51
dual indo max and bloomberg GP that I have already given you examples of right so guys this was context engineering.
2:33:59
Everyone tell me yes or no in the chat if you are able to understand everything so far. We talked about prompt engineering, we
2:34:06
talked about rag, we also talked about fine-tuning,
2:34:11
right? And the question is the question is that
2:34:16
what you should use what you should use is
2:34:22
usually decided by your context in your problem. Okay? Don't think that if some
2:34:28
company was able to use something and get the results, you will also get it. Please try to understand the user problems, the context, the limitations,
2:34:36
the trade-offs and then choose whether you should go with prompt engineering, rag or fine-tuning. You should always
2:34:42
start with prompt engineering. If there's a issue with data, go with rack and then if the issue is with
2:34:47
personality or the base data, then go with fine-tuning. Right? There is also
2:34:53
an interesting thing that is coming across these days. I'll just give you a hint. We talk about this in detail in
2:34:59
our bigger program which is an amazing thing which is called as
2:35:06
transfer learning. Okay, this is an upcoming very I would say very promising field and many companies are going to
Introduction to Transfer Learning
2:35:13
adopt this. Just a moment.
2:35:26
Yes. So there is something called as transfer learning.
2:35:31
So what we do is the issue with large language models is that more intelligent
2:35:37
the model okay more it is going to cost and more it is going to have latency
2:35:44
which is it is going to take more time to respond. So if you go to the OpenAI API,
2:35:54
okay, OpenAI API cost, okay, so if I go to pricing,
2:36:01
understand that this GPT 5 is their best model and the cost of GPT5 is for output
2:36:08
$10 per 1 million tokens, right? And then they have a small model which is GP nano which is $0.41 $4 for 1 million
2:36:16
tokens almost 25x difference. Right? So models
2:36:23
which are small models have less number of parameters are more efficient and
2:36:28
cost effective but they do not have the right kind of they are not trained on more data and they do not have more parameter that means their output could
2:36:35
be a bit here and there. Okay. So we have something called a transfer learning. What we do is we pick a small
2:36:40
language model such as Gemma or a combination of or something between
2:36:46
the small and the large language model such as nano which is GP nano 5 nano or 4 nano
2:36:53
whatever you want to choose. Okay, these things have less cost. What you will do is you will go ahead generate some
2:37:01
synthetic data from the top models which is GPT5 or Gemini 2.5 flash okay you are
2:37:10
going to use Gemini in order to generate some synthetic data and then you are going to generate that data and then you
2:37:15
are going to fine-tune these models on that data so that these these models although they will not get as
2:37:21
intelligent as GPT5 or or or Gemini 2.5 but still if you give on specific use
2:37:27
cases. For example, if you are using for customer support, if you are using for coding, if you are using for coding in a
2:37:33
particular language, if you are using for a particular use case, then you can generate enough data and then you can
2:37:38
retrof these models with fine-tuning and then there is going to be one-time cost of finetuning. But then eventually your
2:37:44
overall cost of API and inference will reduce. This is called as transfer learning. So you have a small language
2:37:49
model which is efficient which has less cost but it does not know about certain
2:37:55
knowledge. So you will generate that knowledge artificially from bigger models put that knowledge into
2:38:01
fine-tuning data for these small language models then the small language models will become more powerful for
2:38:06
your context. Right? So imagine these large language
2:38:12
models as swords. But sometimes for some purposes you
2:38:18
don't need a sword. You just need a needle and then transfer learning gives the power of sword to this particular
2:38:24
needle. Right? A quick yes on everyone if you're able to understand the power of transfer
2:38:31
learning. You can explore more about this. We talk about this in more detail in our bigger
2:38:37
program. super helpful skill for any product manager because implementing LM and understanding is is is is easy but
2:38:45
getting the most out of from this is super important. Yes. Cool. Now with that being said, let
2:38:53
us go ahead and talk about the interesting piece in the room. Okay. Which is AI agents.
Creating and Utilizing AI Agents
2:39:02
So far the AI agent was
2:39:08
like your most interesting, your most uh intelligent manager. They are telling
2:39:14
you that this is what you should do, this is what you should do, this is what you should do. But they are not taking action. And nothing is more frustrating
2:39:21
than a handsoff manager which has they don't know how to do the work but they always try to give you knowledge and gam
2:39:28
okay and LM are the same. You give them the input, they give you the output and they appear the most intelligent part.
2:39:34
But they cannot act. Act means you do not want the LLM just to write an
2:39:40
email. You want them to send the email and take the follow-ups. You want them to do your work rather than just being your uh uh uh your brainstorming buddy.
2:39:48
So in order to give agency to the agent in to the AI, we have something called as AI agents. So AI agent is nothing but
2:39:55
a very simple concept. Okay, which is we give access to some actions to our
2:40:04
agents. We get our AI to act. So what we do is a simple example of agent is let's
2:40:12
say I post very frequently on LinkedIn. Okay. And if someone wants to go ahead
2:40:20
and be updated with what is happening in the product management world, what they
2:40:26
can just do is go to my profile, look at what I have recently posted and then you
2:40:31
should be able to understand what is happening in the AI product management world. Okay, but this thing you have to do manually. What if there would be a
2:40:40
large language model? What if there would be a software or an agent that can go to my profile every day in the
2:40:47
morning look at the five recent post that I have done let's say not every day but let's say in a way in a week in that
2:40:53
week whatever I have posted they should collect all that post and then they should give all of this post to a large
2:41:00
language model which can summarize all the important content and then it can send me an email. This is an example of
2:41:06
a large language model. This is an example of an AI agent. Okay, which is I am choosing a time where I am going to
2:41:13
crawl a profile, LinkedIn profile. I'm going to get all of their post. Then I'm going to summarize this content and then
2:41:19
I'm going to get them to send an email. The summarize part is the intelligent part that is done by AI. That is why it is called as an AI agent.
2:41:27
Right now I can go ahead and tweak this AI agent more. What I can do is I can allow tell the AI agent that rather than
2:41:34
getting the post from someone, you only go ahead and send me the message rather rather than crawling all
2:41:41
the post, you should only go ahead and crawl the post where something is written about AI product management. So
2:41:47
now the AI agent will go ahead and take some calls based on or take some decisions based on the content that it
2:41:54
finds. So when the AI agent is taking some decisions based on its own context
2:42:00
then it is called an autonomous AI agent when it is just going ahead and following the instruction it is a
2:42:05
workflow agent right a quick yes everyone if you're
2:42:10
able to understand the example of AI agent
2:42:18
cool and we'll actually create that agent today okay so intelligence autonomy and uh action Right? And there
2:42:25
are multiple platform guys understand building AI agents these days is not rocket science. It is commoditized
2:42:32
information. How to build great agents is something that is something that you need to learn. Okay. So if you go to
2:42:38
platforms such as agents.ai, ZPR, NAN and OpenAI has very recently created their agent kit. You can go ahead and
2:42:45
create multiple agents. Okay. However,
2:42:50
there has been a report recently. There has been a report recently and this report got way too popular and it has
2:42:57
mentioned that 95% of most of the AI initiative most of them are AI agents
2:43:02
have failed and the reason being there was a learning gap. Learning gap means
2:43:08
these project did not fail because these people were failing to engineer agents.
2:43:14
They were able to create agents but the problem was these agents were actually not solving any good enough problem
2:43:22
and it was not learning from the feedback right so anytime you want to go ahead
2:43:29
and build any kind of product please remember this if you are creating AI
2:43:34
agent if you are creating a normal traditional product or even if you are creating an offline product please make
2:43:40
sure that you start from these two If you read this report, I'll I'll
2:43:46
attach this report in the resources section when we are sending this to you, you will understand why not having the
2:43:53
right product sense was a major problem why these things fail rather than just not knowing about the AI. So
2:43:58
understanding AI is easy but using AI at a scale is a different beast altogether.
2:44:04
Right? Yes. So this is simple about AI agents. I'm going to help you understand how AI agents are built. So,
2:44:12
a quick yes or no everyone if you have ever built an agent. A quick yes or no if you have ever built
2:44:18
an agent.
2:44:27
Cool. A lot of nos. Cool. So, I I'll Okay. So, understand is
2:44:32
also a fantastic flow, but I'll show you something even simpler. Okay. So you can go to this app called relay.app.
2:44:42
This is free with enough credit. So I'm using this. Okay. And it is very simple. Okay. So I'll click on login.
2:44:50
I might be logged on already. Okay. So I'm already logged in. Okay. So what I'll do is I'll create a simple flow.
2:44:55
Okay. So I'll click on new workflow.
2:45:00
Now every agent starts from a understand guys. uh this agent I am telling you
2:45:06
these agents that you can build the production grade agents are different
2:45:11
the products that I'm going to give you examples in just a moment they are also agent but right now we are using like a agent that you can also build on your
2:45:17
own okay this is for your own productivity okay so the agent is
2:45:24
yes so the agent is will do the simple thing at 8:00 a.m. In the morning it is
2:45:32
going to crawl my profile or any other profile that you want to. It will take all the posts and then it will summarize
2:45:38
these post and then it will send me an email. That's it. Okay. Summarization
2:45:44
will happen with an AI. So add a trigger. Trigger means when should this event happen? When should this event
2:45:52
happen? Okay. So I will just go ahead and click on schedule trigger. It should happen
2:46:02
tomorrow or at today's 26th today at 8 a.m. So this time has already passed. I
2:46:08
can make it tomorrow. Okay, it can run at this time and it
2:46:14
should run daily. I can also make it any other time. Okay, this is how the event is triggered. Okay, and then I'll click
2:46:20
on done. To make it simple, I have chosen this frequency. But you can also execute your
2:46:26
agent on any other event. For example, when you send a message to Slack, when
2:46:32
you send and get an email from someone, when you go ahead and maybe send a message on Telegram, when you go ahead
2:46:39
and click a button, when you go ahead and get a new lead from your CRM, you can go ahead and add any kind of triggers. Okay, this is just to make it
2:46:45
simple. Keep it simple, right? Then we'll add a step. The other step is I want to add LinkedIn.
2:46:52
So on LinkedIn I will just click on add this tab. I will search for LinkedIn and then
2:46:59
get LinkedIn comments person post. I want some people
2:47:04
some person's post. I'll click on this and then I'll select a URL. So what is
2:47:09
my LinkedIn URL? I'll go to this LinkedIn
2:47:16
slashin / ankit.
2:47:22
So this is my LinkedIn profile. I'll just click on this.
2:47:28
I will enter manually. I will enter this
Summarizing LinkedIn Posts with AI
2:47:34
and then I want to get the top 10 posts and then if posts are not returned then
2:47:40
continue without a result and then done. Second step is done. The third step is I
2:47:47
have to summarize. So I will summarize and then what will I
2:47:52
summarize? I will summarize posts. Next it will automatically tell me what you want to summarize based on what I have
2:47:59
sent from the last step. Okay. And then this is the prompt.
2:48:06
Okay. I can do it better. I can go to chat GPT
Creating Effective Prompts for AI
2:48:12
and I can ask chat GPT that write me an
2:48:17
effective prompt to summarize my LinkedIn posts.
2:48:32
Right. So I will go ahead and copy this.
2:48:38
Right. I'll go ahead and copy this. Okay. But to keep it simple, I'm not using this. But you can just go ahead and copy this and paste it there. Okay.
2:48:45
I'll go ahead with the simple one which is summarize the attached post. Use fewer than 100 words. Okay. Then access
2:48:53
to this this this this is this this. Okay. Plain text. Okay. Done.
2:48:59
Right. And then we have plus button which is I want to send myself an email
Sending Email Summaries
2:49:06
whenever this happens. Email send email to yourself. What is
2:49:11
the subject? Summary from
2:49:17
Ankit's post add body. If I write X I should if I rect the rate I should be
2:49:22
able to get the sum AI output
2:49:33
summary is above okay and then I'll go ahead and click on done
2:49:40
right and now okay so everyone so far write yes or no in the chat if you're
2:49:46
able to understand the flow so far it is super simple Right.
2:49:52
Correct. And now what we'll do is we will just go ahead
2:49:58
and try to test this start now. I can
2:50:03
test this, right? I don't have to wait for morning tomorrow because you guys would not be there. So I will test this
2:50:13
summarize with AI and then an email to yours. So I'll
2:50:19
click on this. This is the email. The post primarily promotes a free multi session AIPM master class which drew
2:50:26
over 800 live attendees. The master class focuses on mastering LLM. This
2:50:31
this this and this. I hope you guys remember this right now guys tell me confident in the
2:50:38
chat if you are confident in creating your own agents now tell me confident in the chat. Yes. So
Understanding AI Agents and Their Components
2:50:45
understand this tooling was never difficult. This tooling was never difficult. What
2:50:51
one thing that AI has done is it has gone ahead and made things simpler for
2:50:57
everyone. It has gone ahead and made things super simpler for everyone. Okay.
2:51:04
As a person, you need to understand that now you have so much power and you have the power to exercise this power. You
2:51:10
have the ability to exercise this power. Okay. Now you should focus on the right use cases. Okay. So what I'll also do is
2:51:21
I will share with you a list. So Google has created an amazing guide. Google has created an amazing guide
Exploring AI Use Cases and Tools
2:51:27
which talks about what are the different kind of use cases in different kind of industries
2:51:34
for AI agents. I will share this guide also with you in the slides so that you are able to understand and then create
2:51:41
agents there. First whenever you create any product understand the users and the business. An AI product manager is a
2:51:49
product manager before they are an AI product manager. Okay tools are easy. I have already taught you the tools. they
2:51:54
are not so difficult. Important thing is understanding to solve the right problems. Okay. And then when you create an AI
2:52:02
agent, these are the things that you need. So this is a general stack that you guys can go ahead and take a screenshot of. In an agent, you need
Building AI Products: Key Considerations
2:52:10
reasoning so that you can summarize, you can take decisions, you can call certain kind of tools, right? And generally LLMs
2:52:17
are used. LM's large language models are GPT, Claude, Llama and others. And small language models are F3 and JMA.
2:52:24
Right? Similarly, you need memory. For example, if you in
2:52:31
chat GPT, it remembers everything that you have told. But when APIs are called in in agents, they might forget about
2:52:36
your older conversation. So, you need to save your memory. Okay. So, understand here what has happened in this model.
2:52:43
What is memory? Let me tell you. So, in this model, in this flow,
2:52:48
it found 10 post then it gathered the data. It sent the data to the other step where the AI summarized it and then it
2:52:56
was able to get that memory that data that summarization to the next step. This is called as memory. Making sure
2:53:02
that LLM and or the whole uh model the whole agent is able to remember what you
2:53:08
just said. Right? This is called as memory. And for memory we have multiple tools.
2:53:15
For memory we have vector databases such as pine cone, chroma, rag and feedback loops. Right. And then there are tools.
2:53:22
Tools can be accessed with the help of databases, visual agents and APIs. APIs are available. There is something also
2:53:28
called as visual agents. Visual agents is it will if it does not have an API, it will act like a computer. It will
Introduction to Visual Agents and Orchestrators
2:53:34
browse, it will click buttons in order to get the data for you. Okay. And then
2:53:40
so open world operator is example of a visual agent.
2:53:45
Right. Then we have orchestrators platform on which you can create these kind of tools these kind of agents. So
2:53:51
langraph crew AI NA10 is these platforms. I have given you a new
2:53:57
example today which is array.app and then we have guard rails. So now understand AI agents are like fire. You
The Importance of Guardrails in AI
2:54:06
can use them to cook your own food. You can use them to show away danger animals. And you can also use it to burn your own hands and burn your own home.
2:54:13
So guardrails are super important. Guardrails make sure that your content is relevant, your agents are safe, you
2:54:20
have you are not abusing the tools and then you are also validating the output before presenting it to users. Right? In
2:54:28
our major big program we tell you about in detail of all of these things so that you are able to build some secure
2:54:34
agents, production grade agents, right? Yes. And uh these are some
2:54:42
examples of agents which are useful. Customer support agents which will read tickets, drafts, replies and then update
2:54:49
the CRM meeting productivity such as fireflies, fireflies and granular that we have discussed yesterday and bizops
2:54:55
business ops which is sepia or enterain agents that monitor incoming data and execute automations. Right? So this is
2:55:01
in a nutshell what agents are. Okay. Now in the next part of the class we are going to talk about how platforms such
2:55:08
as V coding platforms such as Lovable Berchant on Vero works. Okay. But right
2:55:14
now let's take a quick break. Okay. So before that everyone tell me on a scale of 1 to five how good are you able to
2:55:21
understand everything so far? Great. Cool. Amazing. Cool. So now
2:55:27
everyone a quick break of 4 minutes and then we are going to come back.
2:55:34
Quick break of 4 minutes and then come back. I think we are right on time. How much
2:55:42
is the time? Oh 911. Oh 911 is the time. So
2:55:49
great behind lovable.
2:55:56
Cool. I'm sure many of you might have gone
2:56:02
ahead and tried your hands or at least heard about these apps like these very
2:56:09
high growth apps called as lovable, bolt, emergent, fezero. What they do is
2:56:14
you give them a prompt then they work in the back end in order to create a full-fledged application for you. Right?
2:56:22
What these app do at the back end is something that I'm going to tell you today. Okay, I'll tell you at a high
2:56:28
level how these things are supposed to work. But before that we should follow the
2:56:33
follow the rules. Okay, the first thing is what is the user value? The user value here is that as an entrepreneur,
2:56:42
as a product manager, as an engineer, I either do not know how to code or I do
2:56:49
not have enough time to spend on a unproven idea. So what I do is I give it
2:56:55
a prompt. I give I want a tool that can help me build a full-fledged app that
2:57:02
can help me test my idea. Before these kind of apps, before AI, what used to happen? I will hire a developer. I'll
2:57:08
build something and then it will take me a lot of time. Then it will take me a lot of money and then maybe I'll know
2:57:14
that this thing is not working. Right? Why? Because you only know if a product is working when you go ahead and launch it. So it was very difficult to build
2:57:21
full-fledged apps without the involvement of a developer. These low code tools that used to happen before that like web flow and all they were not
2:57:29
very effective for any non-engineer. They still used to take a lot of time. So now with the possibility of AI we
2:57:34
have some tools with which we can just go ahead and give it a prompt. It will be able to go ahead and generate a full website or an app. Right? So value
2:57:41
unlock is definitely there. Okay. But you should define what is the market that you are playing in. Is it engineers
2:57:46
or hobbyist or entrepreneurs or non-coders that will define the UI and
2:57:52
the UX right and the strategy. Why should the business pursue this opportunity? There are so many people
2:57:57
who want to build their own products, right? And traditionally these people have not do not have the power to do
2:58:04
this. Why? Because technology could not support it. Now what has happened right now is that there is a technology called
2:58:10
as Gen AI through which this is possible now. Okay. So now there is a huge
2:58:15
business opportunity out there. You can do the sizing of the market in terms of tam but there is a big market
2:58:20
opportunity right and many product managers many entrepreneurs they want to build quick prototypes before they can
2:58:26
go ahead and full-fledged take the business the engineering resources there is a business value the third part is
2:58:33
design how do we make it intuitive to use so if you look at the platform such as lovable
2:58:40
you'll be able to find multiple things okay first is
2:58:45
these These platforms give you a very good interface where you can just
2:58:52
write a prompt like a chat plus they will let you to add
2:58:58
any screenshots. So most of the people they are inspired. So they will go to a website look at the website it is
2:59:04
looking good they will take a screenshot and they want to make something like that right and then they are also going
2:59:12
to give you examples of how other people have done this. So you are getting some inspiration. Okay. Plus they also make
2:59:18
sure that there is a community which can go ahead and help you. So you
2:59:23
can go ahead and get added to this community and then you can go ahead and learn about how other people are using Lovable. So it makes sure that you are
2:59:29
able to get on boarded on the platform very very easily. Right? And then they also have some
2:59:35
learning tutorials and all that makes sure that it is easier for you to use. And they have also made sure that they have a free pricing plan.
2:59:44
Yes, I already have a paid plan. So they do have a premium plan through which they can you can go ahead and try the
2:59:50
platform before you go ahead and start spending your money. Right? So this makes sure that the platform is usable.
2:59:55
The ultimate usability is coming from the simple fact that an LLM can allow you to generate like convert your simple
3:00:02
prompt into a full-fledged website or a web app. Okay. So this is the usability
3:00:07
and then how does it work? Okay, how does it work? So this is the
3:00:13
simple architecture of these kind of apps. Okay, the user will give the
3:00:18
input. Okay, the user will give a input that please create a clone for Airbnb.
3:00:24
Simple but they are going to enhance it with a system prompt. So they will write
3:00:29
a prompt like you are a senior level system architect and a backend developer
3:00:36
and a front end or a fullstack developer and now you have to create the app the
3:00:42
product that the user is requesting. Make sure that you are going ahead and following up with uh you are going ahead
3:00:48
and following all the engineering principles and using these kind of files and they would go ahead and give more context. Okay. So your prompt whatever
3:00:55
you are giving will be enhanced with the system prompt and then as a result what you will have first it will create a
3:01:02
prompt to plan the whole product. Step number one is create this file. Step number two is create this file. Step number three is create this function
3:01:08
then create an API. So it is going to lay down the complete plan. After that it will create files.
3:01:15
It has access to a virtual environment. So now it is becoming agentic. Why? It
3:01:20
has an access to a tool. What is the tool? The tool is a virtual environment. So what will happen a virtual environment is nothing a piece of
3:01:27
computer that is given to lovable where it can go ahead and deploy your apps.
3:01:32
Okay. So it has access to a file system it has access to an automatic deployment. Okay. And then it is going
3:01:37
to keep on running the file on itself so that it is able to understand if there are any kind of mistakes and then
3:01:43
because it's an agent it is going to automatically correct these mistakes and eventually you are going to get the
3:01:48
output. Okay. So lovable, emergent, vzero are
3:01:54
nothing. They are just agents which work in a loop to correct the mistakes and
3:02:00
they also make sure that they have access to some kind of file system where they can host these files so that you as
3:02:06
a user can go ahead and access these files. Okay. So let me give you a moment. Okay.
3:02:17
This is chat GPT. I am giving a simple prompt to charge GBD. Okay.
3:02:24
I want to create a clone of
3:02:29
Okay. help me create a system prompt
3:02:35
that I can
3:02:40
use in my vibe coding app
3:02:45
where user can enter their idea of app and the system
3:02:55
prompt will make it detail. scale
3:03:01
effective to be able to create a
3:03:08
dependable modern app
3:03:13
with let's say JavaScript as the primary
3:03:20
language. Most of the apps you will see that they are written in JavaScript. Okay, I'll just click on this and then
3:03:26
I'll get a very detailed system prompt.
3:03:34
Yes. So here what will happen? While the prompt is being generated, what will happen here?
3:03:40
I will create a system. If I want to create a clone of lovable, I will create a system. This is the box.
3:03:48
User will input something. This request will be added with my system prompt
3:03:55
and the user input will be added and then it will be sent to an LLM and then I'll get the complete set of
3:04:01
instructions. Right? So this prompt I have taken. Now this is a prompt system prompt. This you
3:04:08
are a Yoder. This this this is this this this. And now you understand everything is
3:04:14
mentioned here. Right. This now will be sent to the LM.
3:04:20
Now based on this files would be generated. So it will create a plan. In the plan there would be some files,
3:04:26
there would be some testing, there would be some functionality and then this will be again sent to the prompt.
3:04:33
Right? You can actually create your own lovable, your own emergent with the help
3:04:39
of relay app because there also you are executing instructions step by step.
3:04:47
Right? So this is how lovable and every platform works on the back end. So agent
3:04:54
is nothing. It is thinking and accessing tools in a loop. So they have
3:05:01
orchestrated them in such a way that they are able to go ahead and execute things again and again in a methodical
3:05:07
or a step-wise manner. Right? Now agents are built on multiple patterns. One pattern is that there is one agent who
3:05:12
is doing multiple task. Then let's say if I give you people an assignment that tomorrow you have to
3:05:18
create a case study on lovable five people in the same team. Okay. Now what will happen? I believe that if five
3:05:24
people are working on the same team the quality should improve. That is why I'm putting five people and I'm giving you
3:05:30
less time. For an individual I would have given one week but for five people I'm giving two days. So now because I
3:05:35
think that efficiency will increase. So now what you guys will do is you will divide the work among yourself that I
3:05:41
will look do the research you do the direct someone is going to do the design someone is going to do something else.
3:05:47
Okay. And when you go ahead and come back you are going to go ahead and combine all the out outputs and then you
3:05:52
are going to create something which is a one case study. So this is how agents also do the orchestration. So there is
3:05:58
also design patterns in agents which define how different agents are going to work with each other.
3:06:06
Okay. So this is in a nutshell what agents are. Okay. Everyone tell me on a
3:06:11
scale of 1 to five you're able to understand agents.
3:06:17
Yes. So please everyone please understand things from first principles which is agent is nothing. Agent did not
3:06:23
existed. AI agent did not existing 4 years ago. Okay. So it's very simple. If
3:06:28
you are creating a workflow which can have an AI LLM in between which can
3:06:34
execute actions for you and do some intelligent task that is an AI agent.
3:06:40
Right now after this there is one problem with the agents.
3:06:45
The problem is that the agents in order to act they need to connect with tools.
3:06:52
LinkedIn is one platform, Gmail is one platform, Google Drive is
3:06:58
one platform, maybe your SMS is one platform, your Telegram is one platform and there are so many platform, your
3:07:03
Slack is one platform. So they need to connect with many tools. And if you are someone who is building agents where LLM
3:07:09
needs to connect with the agents with the tools, then it's a nightmare to read every API and connect your product with
3:07:16
the API. Okay. So if so many let's say like one LM has to connect with multiple
3:07:23
products then everyone has their unique API. So that is a nightmare. So now what
3:07:29
these people have done is enthropic the people behind claude they have created a
3:07:34
simple thing which is they told everyone that if you want to they have told Gmail slack Jira everyone and the whole world
3:07:41
that if anyone wants the LLM to use their APIs please go ahead and create something
3:07:48
called as model context protocol or MCP. So what is an MCP? MCPS is these people
3:07:55
have created one more versions of their APIs or a layer over their APIs which
3:08:00
can be understood by large language models. Right? So maybe yesterday only or a
3:08:08
couple of days before Zumato has launched their own MCP. So Zumato is an Indian website where you can is an
3:08:14
Indian app or website where you can go ahead and order food. So this is the detailed article on the same where is
3:08:20
that? Yes. So now you can go ahead and do so many things from your cloud. So on
3:08:27
your cloud desktop or your chat GPT desktop you can go ahead and install this uh uh this cla this summato MCP and
3:08:34
then you should be able to go ahead and write these kind of queries Indian food in your Indraagar pizza under 200 rupees
3:08:42
and then you should be able to make an order from there only. Right. So now Zumato has an API which already existed
3:08:48
for a long period of time but you cannot have conversation with an API through the LLM through natural language. Now
3:08:56
they have created an MCP. What does an MCP do? MCP converts the natural
3:09:01
language helps the LLM to talk with the API in natural language.
3:09:07
Right? That is an NCP. Okay. And there are multiple I'll share this link with you so that you are able to go and
3:09:12
understand how it is created. Understand it's not difficult to create MCP. What you need to do is if you are a product
3:09:19
like Zumat or any other product in the world, you would have an API documentation. Take that API
3:09:24
documentation, go to chat GPT and ask it to convert into an MCP. It will give you
3:09:30
a file that you have to host on your server and then you are done. You have to do a couple of testing as well but that is done
3:09:38
right. So that is model context protocol. So in model context protocol we have three components. The first part
3:09:43
is the AI host where you are going to send query. So it could be claude, cursor, chat, GPT. This is where your
3:09:50
MCP client is going to be there. This is your MCP client. Okay. Then there's an MCP server that is hosted at the person
3:09:58
who has given you the MCP which is Zumato or Razer Pay or something. And then there is a data source. This is
3:10:04
stored at Zumato or somewhere where you can go ahead and have the data or you can take actions. Okay. So any MCP
3:10:10
server will give you a small file that is called as client configuration file. You have to enter it into your cloud or
3:10:16
any of the LLM that you are using and then your agent will be able to talk to these tools without understanding the
3:10:21
API. Right? So this is MCP. You can go ahead and read more about it. Right? Yes. So
3:10:29
we have talked about so many things so far. Cool.
3:10:37
Everyone tell me how would you describe the session so far in one word so that I know if we are going in the right direction.
3:10:43
Tell me how would you explain this session so far in one word so that I can go ahead and
3:10:52
tell you something more. Yes. Great. Now let me just go ahead. Thank
3:10:58
you. Thank you everyone. Thank you for the nice words. Now I think we are on time. So we have some more time. So I'll
3:11:03
give you one more thing. Okay, which is evaluations.
3:11:09
Look at this very carefully. Okay, so there are some challenges that happen in building AI products. The
Evaluating AI Products
3:11:17
challenges are they hallucinate. They have certain kind of biases and they are indeterministic.
3:11:23
Okay. But understand nowadays you people would be understanding that language models are becoming more and more intelligent. Okay. If you find that
3:11:30
there is an error, you can ask it to correct that error and it corrects that error. Okay. But still large language
3:11:37
models are these powerful beast. If you leave them without a leash then they can
3:11:44
do a lot of disaster to your customers. Okay. So this is what AI believes like.
3:11:50
Okay. It believes that it has all the content in the world and it can give answers like wrong answers with complete
3:11:56
confidence. Okay. So that is why we have something to tame these beast. The leash that
3:12:03
works on your LLMs is called as evaluations. Okay. And what happens is whenever your
3:12:10
LLM is not working and if you're not getting the right kind of output, there are certain issues and you can resolve
3:12:16
these issues with three things. Okay. So when you are building any kind of GI product, you have to take three
3:12:23
important decisions. The one important decision is what is the model that you are going to choose. If you choose a
3:12:29
very high quality model then you have to pay more cost. If you choose a very low cost model
3:12:37
then you have an issue of accuracy. Right? Similarly rag instrumentation in
3:12:44
rag there are multiple components. If your chunk size is not correct then
3:12:51
the information that it is giving you would be incorrect. If you understand I have told you that there is a vector
3:12:56
embedding but for vector embedding also there are multiple algorithms which algorithm should you use okay it depends
3:13:02
on the use case. So what is going to be the instrumentation of your rag? What is the vector algorithm? What is the size
3:13:09
of chunking? What are the different kind of model that you will use? That is also very important.
3:13:14
Okay. These are the decision that you need to take. And then context engineering. What should be the prompt?
3:13:20
How long should be the context? how you should give the instructions. These things are going to determine whether
3:13:26
your geni app is working rightly or not. And this is actually engineering.
3:13:31
Engineering why? Because there is going to be a lot of course correction.
3:13:37
Okay. So in order to do these things, in order to understand whether our geni
3:13:43
application is working well or not, we have something called as evaluations. So what evaluations do is they check the
3:13:49
output for correct syntax and formats for bias for correctness relevance and
3:13:54
other unnecessary checks. Okay. So for example if on notebook LM al on granular we
3:14:04
generated a summary we want to understand whether this summary is actually aligned with whatever has been said in the meeting or not. So how do we
3:14:10
test this? We test this with the help of large language models. Okay. So what we
3:14:17
do is to help you understand I'm going to give you a case study on the AI first job
3:14:23
website. Okay. So tell me in the chat how many people are looking for jobs.
3:14:30
Tell me in the chat yes or no if you're looking for a job.
3:14:39
Yes guys even if you don't know your colleagues and your bosses might be present in this meeting. Now
3:14:47
I will give you an idea. Okay. And I'm sure many people would have faced this. Okay. So let's say I am creating a new
3:14:53
kind of job website where what I'll do is I will crawl all the websites from
Creating a Job Website with AI
3:14:58
the all I will crawl all the jobs from major websites from the internet. So I'll go to hired, I'll go to LinkedIn,
3:15:06
I'll go to no, I'll go to Instaire, I'll go to multiple websites. I'll go to indeed and other websites in order to
3:15:12
crawl jobs. scroll as in I will go to this website automatically I will get the content and I'll scrape the jobs so
3:15:19
now I have a job database I have database of all the job descriptions
3:15:25
titles companies and everything right now what I'll do is I will enhance this
3:15:31
job with LLM I will enhance this job with LLM and by enhancing what I mean is
3:15:37
I will give it a prompt and then what I'll do is I will generate this output so I will enter a job description and
3:15:45
then the LLM will give me summary of the job description possible interview question. So from the
3:15:51
job description in the company it will try to understand what are the question that can be asked
3:15:57
skills that are needed to do this job learning guide for this job and quiz for
3:16:03
assessment which is a small quiz that will help me understand whether I'm ready to fill or apply for this job or
3:16:09
not. Okay, this is a simple website that I need to create. Okay, tell me everyone
3:16:16
will this kind of website will be helpful for you or not? People are looking for jobs.
3:16:24
Yes. So, it will give you some more context about the job description.
3:16:31
Right. So, now and this can be created. You can go ahead and create this website
3:16:37
today also like by using labable or something. Okay. But now there is an issue. How do I know this job
3:16:43
description, interview question, skill needed, learning guide, everything is good or not. Okay. So I'm going to
3:16:49
introduce one method of so understand these things that I have told you which
3:16:54
is all of these things they are done with multiple methods. One of the method
3:17:00
to run your evaluations is called as LLM as a judge. So we run our outputs
3:17:09
through another more intelligent LLM in order to understand whether it is correct output or not. Okay. So here the
3:17:16
issue is that although I'm generating good information but this information can be wrong.
3:17:21
Okay. So what I'll do is I'll do this. Okay. So I have crawled a job from the internet. I have stored them in my
3:17:28
database. I have ran them through LLMs and then I have created this
3:17:35
content. I have created this content. Now what I'll do is I will get all of
3:17:43
these things again go through another LLM in order to understand which is called as evaluation
3:17:51
that whether this content is correctly created or not. This is called as LLM as
3:17:58
a judge and then I will find out whether the content is correct or not. This is a
3:18:04
simple method of evaluation. Let me show you how it works.
3:18:19
Yes. So this is the evaluation. Look at this very carefully guys. This is the prompt that I'll go to the I'll give to the another LM. Okay. You are an AI
3:18:27
content quality evaluator for product management job listings. Given the following, this is the
3:18:32
original job description. This is the AI generated summary. This is the interview question. This is the output from the
3:18:39
other LLM. Right? These are the skills. These are the concept. This is a quiz.
3:18:44
Evaluate the content using the following checklist. Is the summary accurate? Interview questions correct? Listed skills aligned? Are the concept useful?
3:18:51
Is the quiz challenging? is any information correct or hell needing and then give me the response in this
3:18:56
particular format okay then I'll have a dashboard where for every job description this score
3:19:03
would be mentioned then I would know whether my LLM is working correctly or not okay so let's say if I get poor or
3:19:12
fair or low or weak what I'll do is I will go back I will again try to tweak
3:19:17
these things if my quality is add then I will maybe
3:19:23
choose change the model or I'll change the rag instrumentation or I'll go ahead and change the context engineering which
3:19:29
is the prompt that I have given okay that is how you improve upon AI product with the help of evaluation this is a
3:19:35
super simplistic example of evaluations okay there are codebased evaluations as well there are LLM based evaluations as
3:19:42
well generally this evaluation LLM that you use so this is
3:19:49
LLM1 and this is LLM2. This LLM is generally a more intelligent LLM which
3:19:54
is able to assess. Right? So this is an example of evaluation. Everyone a quick yes or no
3:20:00
if you're able to understand this.
3:20:13
Yes, there are many open source LLM guys. OpenAI OSS is an open source LLM.
3:20:19
Lama is an open source LLM. Right? So this is there. Now we have
3:20:27
almost completed the session. This is some set of tools. If you guys are curious, you can go ahead and start
3:20:32
using this in your product management workflow. There is also a detailed video on this on our YouTube channel. Okay. AI
3:20:39
for PM toolkit discovery for discovery for discovering what to build chat GP notebook perplexity mix panel textsql.
3:20:46
Okay. for delivering at intelligence which is nothing but Jira, Asana, Vzero,
3:20:52
Kurser, Postbot, Figma which you can use to create wireframes prototypes very quickly. Okay. And then for distribution
3:20:58
you have craftable, chatbased, notion, genex, moage that can help you create marketing materials, collaborate with
3:21:03
your team and look at analytics. Okay. So try to explore these tools at your own time so that you are able to
3:21:09
become an AI enabled PM as well. Whatever we have discussed so far was for AI like applied AIPM, right? And
3:21:16
then one more important thing guys that in this program like so far what I
3:21:23
have done is I have given you information
3:21:28
I have given you information about evaluations about agents about various tools about
3:21:36
rack about prompt engineering about finetuning but information is not helpful for you information is just a
3:21:42
couple of prompts away what you need is knowledge.
3:21:49
And how do you convert information into knowledge? With the help of action and with the help of feedback
3:21:58
and reflection. Right? So what you need to do is please
3:22:04
do not limit yourself to only this knowledge. Go ahead and do something. Doing as in
3:22:11
go ahead and build something. Okay? You have so much information available across the internet. Utilize and try to
3:22:18
go ahead and build something right. If you guys are looking for mentorship then we also have a very detailed program. So
3:22:25
understand whatever I have told you in this last two session that is not even 10% of what we teach in our bigger
3:22:31
program. So if you really found this information genuine useful I teach a
3:22:36
bigger program which is a 15week program on AI product management. Okay you can go to the website you can get all the
3:22:42
details out there. But if you have to ask me let's say three reasons why you should join LOPM program
3:22:48
against other programs is very simple. First it is the most detailed AI product
3:22:54
management program. We first talk about the traditional product management then we talk about AI product management. You
3:22:59
can go to the website you can compare the curriculum. You can compare curriculum to any other course in the world. You will not be able to find a
3:23:06
more detailed program. First point. Second point is everything is practical. We believe in doing things. So in the
3:23:13
end of the program, you're actually going to go ahead and build your own product. Okay. So if you go ahead and go to the website,
3:23:22
if you go ahead and go to the website hellom.co, you should be able to find in the curriculum section that this is the
3:23:29
whole curriculum. Everything is supported with a lot of case studies and tools.
3:23:34
Plus in the end of the sessions, we are also going to help you build your own AI
3:23:39
product. This helps you prove to other people and to yourself that you are not an
3:23:46
information seeker. You are actually someone who understands how to build products and this is a big opportunity
3:23:52
for you. Right. And we also help you prepare for interviews and all that is given. And then
3:24:01
yes and then the third part is we are the only program that supports you for the long term. Even if you have
3:24:08
completed the program, we understand that some people are able to get the job within the program, some people get the
3:24:13
job after the program. We support you for a period of two years. So in these two years, if you have any questions, any feedback, anything that you want to
3:24:19
get help from us, you should be able to talk to us. Okay. And every week, we keep on doing sessions to make sure that
3:24:24
you are able to learn. Okay. The
3:24:30
Yes. Yes. And you can go to the website in
3:24:37
order to check all the other details that are out there. The cost of the program stands at 75,000 rupees or
3:24:43
$1,000 if you are outside from India. Okay. But it is my assurance that if you go ahead and take this program, this is
3:24:48
going to go ahead and give you a lot of content,
3:24:54
right? We don't give any kind of discounts, but this is the context. You if you want to get more information
3:25:00
about this cohort, just go to the website hello.co and then click on this video. You should be able to get all the information right now
3:25:09
an important part. Okay, that is why I've given you this context.
3:25:14
Yes, classes are conducted on Saturday and Sunday evening 8:30 to 10:30 for ISD and
3:25:21
morning for the US batches. Okay. So now everyone understand if you really want to get into AI
3:25:27
product management you have to build a strong portfolio so that people understand that you have what it takes.
Building a Strong AI Portfolio
3:25:34
Okay. You are actually not a talker but a doer. Okay. So what you should do is in order to create a portfolio you can
3:25:41
start very small. You start by commenting and start by creating content
3:25:46
about geni. Understand for yourself. Okay. Then do tear down in case studies.
3:25:52
Then do product improvements and go ahead and build some like try to go ahead and build some hypothesis of the
3:25:57
products. After that build some side projects and then if you have already done some past work you can include all
3:26:02
of these things and then you can use in your portfolio. You can go to the hello channel there we have created. So if you
3:26:08
go to the hello channel on YouTube
3:26:14
we have an amazing playlist called as summer of product. Okay. Or this is the
3:26:21
playlist getting started with product management or summer of product where I have explained how to create a portfolio.
3:26:31
Okay. And then the last part is this. This is the most important slide. What
3:26:36
you should do is please do not limit this information that I have told you so far to just this session. Okay? Don't
3:26:43
forget about everything as soon as you leave the session. Please take action. What you should do is reverse engineer top AI products in the same way that I
3:26:50
have told you. Understand gaps, frustrations in your personal and professional workflow. Build AI tools
3:26:55
and agents to solve these problems. Start writing what you are learning. Tag me. I'll be able to like and post and
3:27:01
depost. Right? And then keep a track of AI companies what they are doing. Help them improve, enhance, expand and then
3:27:06
follow up. Try to find companies who are do really doing good and then understand
3:27:12

2:00
your journey as a product manager. Product management has now become one of the most influential business critical
Product Management Courses: Are They Really Worth It?
2:08
highest paid functions at any tech company. Sounds like I'm exaggerating a
2:13
lot, right? But that's the fact because these professional are famously known as the CEOs of the product. I mean, let's
2:20
even keep that aside. You just go onto YouTube and search for the term product manager or product management and you'll
2:27
find that there are some serious talks out there around this topic with views above millions. You go into the nude
2:34
section on Google, you'll find many news articles and plenty of blogs around product management too. Well, I don't
2:41
even have to explain this hype to you because the fact that you have clicked on this video proves that you also agree
2:48
that product management is something that you need to look into. And it is really something you need to learn. But
2:54
obviously since there is so much hype, there are so many courses available online claiming that they have the best
3:01
curriculum and are equipped to make you a product manager. And when you have so many options on the plate, wondering
3:08
about whether they are worth it or not, which one is the best for you are kind of natural questions that would hit your
3:15
conscience. Well, don't be worried because in this particular video, we are going to address both of these
3:21
questions. By the end of next 10 minutes, you'll have a clear perspective about whether product management courses
3:27
are really worth it or not. But before we begin, make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel to come across more
3:34
career tips related videos like this one. First, let's talk about how one can
3:39
become a product manager and what role do PM courses play in getting you started. So if you have been already
3:46
surfing online about ways to become a product manager, let's be very realistic here. While these courses without a
3:53
doubt can help you in your product journey, they can help you understand what matters the most for building
3:58
cuttingedge products, can share the industry case studies from which you can inspire and brainstorm the creative
4:04
product strategies. But one thing they can't do is end up as a reason behind
4:09
you becoming the product manager. Basically what I mean is product management courses will not be the major
4:17
reason behind you getting a job. Most of the time you getting PM role will revolve around the relevant experience
4:24
that you have on offer be it from marketing, tech, sales or finance and
4:29
how you can connect that experience to what a PM role exactly requires. To kind
4:34
of put it in a layman terms, a product manager is basically responsible for building a product that will gain lot of
4:41
traction and will bring huge financial success to the company. Now what do I
4:46
exactly mean by word traction? Well, traction basically means quantitative evidence of customer demand. For an
4:53
enterprise software company, the initial traction could be some customers who are willing to pay. Whereas for consumer
5:00
software product, the initial traction would be hundreds or even thousands of user. In the most basic sense, traction
5:07
is growth. And if you are to become a product manager, you need to know how to achieve it by doing market research,
5:15
market product analysis, defining the pricing strategy to increase product adoption, improving the user experience
5:21
and usability of the product, and building the right messaging to engage the target customers. If you have kind
5:28
of dealt with some of these things in your previous job role, chances are you'll be able to align yourself as a
5:34
product manager. Naturally, there are job roles that allow you to build these skills such as sales, marketing,
5:41
software engineering, project management, etc. These are the roles that are part of value chain that PM
5:47
would go ahead and touch upon. So, if you were to become a PM, starting with a role in one of these fields would be the
5:54
best idea. You also need to build a deep product and consumer centric acumen alongside the strong professional
6:01
network because at the end of the day your professional network would go ahead and help you transition into the PM
6:07
roles with recommendation. Now you must be thinking networking and experience are the vital most pillars. Then how
6:14
would the PM course prove to be of help? Well, the straightforward answer to that question is the product management
6:20
courses would basically give you a framework of how you can connect the dots between your existential experience
6:26
and a PM role. It would give you the tools that would allow you to do things in order to generate the traction. It
6:33
would give you the knowhow about important keywords related to product management which you can further stuff
6:39
into your portfolio, your LinkedIn profile to sort of start building yourself as a PM prospect over the job
6:45
boards. The course would allow you to connect with people who are really passionate about the product and help
6:52
you learn values from them that would help you build the next winning product strategy. So if I were to sum it up, a
6:59
course would align you with product psychology and give you the tools that would allow you to do task that a PM
7:06
does. Now if that's clear, you need to have a certain checkpoints when it comes to choosing a course. That checkpoints
7:13
would be number one verified industry relevant certification, number two the
7:19
curriculum and career benefits of the course and number three would be cost. Now let's break all these three pointers
7:26
one by one. So if I were to talk about the certification see first of all there
7:31
is no standard certification out there in the market for product management. Like for example for investment banking
7:38
there exist a worldwide recognized certification like CFA but that's not the case for PM. However, one thing you
7:45
can make sure of is that the certification is verified and does have some sort of value associated in the
7:52
market. But to be fair, there is no established certification per se that is going to help you land into a PM role.
8:00
That being said, let's talk about the next pointer that is curriculum and career benefits. See product management
8:06
have certain value chain associated with it and you'll need a strong working knowledge of all those skills involved
8:13
alongside the practical exposure. That's where the curriculum matters the most. You need to make sure that the topics
8:19
that are currently being highlighted on the screen are there in the courses you are opting for. You also need to make
8:26
sure that the course takes through certain projects to sort of give you the practical understanding. The next point
8:32
is cost. Okay. Like if you go online and search for product management courses,
8:37
you'll find certain flagship options available wherein you'll get courses from reputed colleges but the price
8:44
point would be very very high. Now again you need to think about one thing there
8:49
is no standard at all when it comes to product management certification. So whether you have learned the skills from
8:56
program priced at a high cost or a program price at low cost or affordable cost the value proposition difference is
9:04
not going to be there. So you can go ahead and look out for the affordable program with high quality curriculum and
9:11
career advancement benefits like placement assistance, interview preparation, resume and LinkedIn profile
9:17
reviews etc. By doing this you kind of invest less and gain all the values that
9:23
any PM course has to offer. If I were to recommend you guys one course then that would be this product management course
9:29
by IM Ranchi. If you guys don't know I am Ranchi, it is one of the tier one institutes in India which is marked as
9:36
an institute of national importance by the government of India and through this particular course you are directly going
9:43
to learn from the faculty of this premier institute itself. Right? This will allow you to connect with
9:49
researchers and IM Ranchi faculties, fellow batchmates who are basically
9:54
working in product domain itself, right? And this kind of network building would
9:59
allow you to establish yourself as a really good product professional. I endorse this particular option and I
10:06
would like to urge you guys to go ahead and explore it. The link for this particular course is dropped in the
10:11
comment box below as well as in the description box. Cool. So this is a very introductory
Introduction to Product Management
10:17
course right uh we just sort of understand what product management is what are the things that are involved in
10:23
being a product manager what does a product manager do right all of those
10:28
basic bits right and as the course proceeds we'll get into the of various
10:34
sections and subs meaning of a product manager right a
10:39
product manager is essentially a a professional who is responsible for guiding the success of a product leading
10:45
the cross functional team that is responsible for improving it. They are essentially the bridge between various
10:52
teams and stakeholders primarily business, technology, user experience, right? You could call it marketing,
10:59
sales, customer service, all of those bit. uh I don't know if you guys have heard the there's this cool term which
11:06
goes around especially on LinkedIn a lot where product project managers or
11:11
product managers are are called the CEO of the product and all of that um
11:17
honestly you're not the CEO of the product the CEO is the CEO right uh you
11:23
are essentially the person responsible for the product for the success for the failure right it is your head which is
11:31
on the Um a product manager's job although from
11:37
an outside looks looks very enticing very interesting right uh
11:45
it comes with a lot of uh responsibility and very less authority.
11:52
All right. Uh so you need to get things done from various teams, various people
12:00
whom you have no control and no authority over. But if those things if those things are not getting done then
12:07
it is again your neck on the line. The product
12:15
here as you can see in this graph sits in the center of all these various functions right finance, customer
12:21
service, product delivery, strategy, business leadership, right? So being a
12:28
product manager, you are exposed to a lot of these functions. Uh in 10 years I can say I just product
12:37
but I also know a lot of finance. I know a lot of marketing, I know a lot about
12:42
customer service, I know a lot of design, right? Obviously tech, right? Uh
12:48
and I can say that if you talk to me as let's say one-on-one on a marketing
12:53
topic, I can I can talk to you about it, right? I can talk to you about finance. I can talk to you about SAP
12:59
integrations. I can talk to you about customer service and what CRM and how
13:05
the workflow goes and how the agents are getting trained and all of that bit right. I can talk to you on a very high
13:11
level about strategy and business leadership of what the vision of the company should be of where should we go
13:17
next, what should we do next. I can talk to you about all of that. Right? I can talk to the salespeople about what are
13:24
they pitching, how are they pitching, right? What are the value proposition that they are showing? What are the ROI
13:30
that they're trying to show to the customer? What should they alter in their pitch? All of that bit.
13:36
So being in product it just exposes you to this whole gamut of knowledge which
13:41
in my experience if you sit in let's say one of these particular domains you might not get exposed to so much because
13:48
obviously your engine with a lot of people will be much more lesser right let's say the finance guy will not
13:55
really talk a lot to the customer service guy right they might talk to the sales people a bit to the marketing but
14:03
definitely not a lot to this customer service guy or the sales guy will probably not talk a lot to the design
14:09
guy, right? Uh so instead of a silo
14:14
since you are interacting with all of these people on a day-to-day basis, you get exposed to a right. So that is the
14:22
of being in product and I'm assuming you guys must have seen something of this sort and hence you guys are also
14:30
interested in being a product. So pros of product management exposure
14:36
to multiple disciplines high impact skill development right we spoke about all of this career growth obviously when
14:43
you know a lot of things you can talk to your people internally about a lot of things help
14:48
them with different things even in their vertical your career is bound to grow right challenges for freshers is
14:57
that is currently since there are lot of product manage project man product managers already in in the industry
15:04
right experience kind of becomes required I think this is an age-old problem right uh but I don't think this
15:10
is such a big problem that it cannot be solved high responsibility right uh
15:15
freshers come in they're given a small piece of the product but even that piece is has a lot of impact so it's a very
15:23
highly responsible role there's a lot of cross functional coordination which new
15:28
people in this domain might find a little difficult to kind of work around
15:34
with. These are some tips that they have given. Learn the basics, develop soft
15:39
skills, build a portfolio, network, gain relevant exp. So this is what you know
15:45
this slide talks about fresh. But even for let's say you know since we are a bunch of lot of like I think all of this
15:53
kind of applies here as well, right? when we have a lot of project managers
16:00
and uh you guys must have seen that you know transitioning into product not easy. If it were be it was then most
16:08
probably you might not have taken course. uh domain experience becomes a
16:14
requirement, right? uh cross function coordination becomes required which thankfully most product managers are
16:20
also already expert at right uh but to a lot of
16:26
what one you know like to advise is if you really want to be product managers
16:31
right um and if you're not are three things right develop your soft
16:38
skills too wherein your stakeholder management becomes the key in this role
16:45
because All you're really doing as a product manager is it could be your customers, it could be your internal
16:51
people, it could be your leadership, could be anyone. You're not designing, you're not coding, you're not selling,
16:56
you're not getting right, you're not doing, all you're doing is driving the
17:01
vision to make that product a success. And how you're doing it is primarily by
17:06
talking and coordinating and ensuring that things are going right as per the plan. Right. Yes. You you you build a
17:14
product vision, you plan it, you do your Jiraa stories, you write your user stories, all of that bit, right?
17:22
From an impact perspective is just 10% of of your
17:27
70% is talking to people and the rest is actually looking at data, looking at
17:32
your customers, observing and coming up with great insights to
17:38
right. Even if you're not great at the whole documentation piece and all of that, it is fine. You can still work it
17:46
out, right? As long as you can manage people around you well and you can
17:51
really come up with great new ideas right where in jobs which require let's say a
17:58
domain experience a lot right a lot of roles might which you let's say we don't
18:03
have right now the easiest way to do is for right and build a portfolio could be
18:09
you can just build a simple Shopify website right sell some try to sell some
18:14
t-shirt on on it or something of that sort and show it to somebody in the next interview that this is what I've done
18:21
and this is what I've learned out of it. Let's say even if that is difficult right build a lot of case studies
18:29
publish it on LinkedIn right a lot of people now if you look at
18:34
it like I remember I hired a fresher a couple of years back right and all he
18:39
had was a portfolio but he had written about everything under the sun right
18:44
from Ola case studies to Swiggy Zamato this and that and that just showed that
18:51
he's actually very interested Right. And he's not just coming to to
18:58
being a product manager because one it is sexy, second it it probably pays a
19:03
decent amount. Those things are are kind of immaterial when you're somebody and it also becomes
19:10
a problem when you're hiring because you get a lot of people who don't know the
19:15
the basics of product but really want to be product man.
19:20
Right. any question or any questions in general that you guys have about product
19:28
and what it so what are the different levels of product management right uh
19:33
your first is your associate product manager role right this is an entry-level position for individuals
19:40
sorry product management often graduates and those transitioning from other roles
19:46
are assigned this uh responsibility ities are uh assisting in
19:52
gathering and documenting product requirements, conducting market research and competitive
19:58
supporting the product manager in road map development and collaborating with teams on minor
20:04
feature enhancements learning the fundamentals of product man through mentorship and hands-on
20:10
experience right so yes these are your responsibilities but uh in practicality what really
20:17
happens is when you are at a let's say an APM role So you are given a very small piece of
20:23
the products right. So you will be probably responsible just for developing one feature of the product. So let's say
20:29
if the product is a website then probably the APM will be responsible for
20:35
one page somewhere in that website right and he will then work with a product
20:42
manager to develop that page understand how that entire product fundamentals
20:48
work the journey works and and develop his skills
20:53
a PM which is a product manager is a mid-level position for individual with some experience Responsibilities.
21:00
Defining and managing the product roadmap. Conducting in-depth market research and user analysis.
21:06
Gathering and prioritizing product requirements. Working closely with engineering design, marketing and sales
21:12
team to deliver product features. Monitoring and analyzing product performance and user feedback and
21:18
ensuring that the product aligns with the business goals and and customer needs. Right? So here let's say the
21:28
responsibility is a little more larger. They are responsible for a bigger chunk of the entire product.
21:34
So let's say inside uh the entire chat you could have one
21:40
product looking at this entire chatbot right where they will define that okay I
21:47
will start the chatbot with these X features then 6 months down the line we'll put in Y features then 3 years
21:53
down the line we'll have Z features right they'll do a lot of market research user analysis talk to users
21:59
what are their pain point what do they want out of a chatbot right they will
22:04
gather all these requirements, prioritize them in terms of impact, reach, all of these different metrics.
22:10
There's an entire framework to prioritize requirements, right? And then they'll work with engineering,
22:16
marketing, sales, design, everybody to deliver these these product features, right? Uh sorry, once the product is
22:24
live, they will monitor the performance. They will monitor analyze the user
22:29
feedback and then they will kind of also ensure that this product and that the
22:36
journey of the product aligns with the business goals obviously and also the customer needs right. So, so a little
22:43
more responsible for a bigger chunk of the piece is what the product then you have your senior PM which is
22:50
your senior product manager which is more of an advanced level position for experienced product managers with a pro
22:56
record right responsibilities are leading the product strategy and road map for one or
23:02
managing complex and high impact product initiatives mentoring and guiding junior
23:07
product managers and APMS engaging with key stakeholders and executive to align align the product vision with the come
23:13
strategy right uh driving product growth through datadriven decisions and
23:20
ensuring successful product launches and improvements. So this becomes with a lot
23:25
more strategic and uh a lot more higher level stakeholderities.
23:34
you are kind of aligning the the CEOs and all of that with the product vision
23:40
and the company strategy and then seeing all right this is what our product will evolve into tomorrow right and then you
23:47
obviously go and give those sets of instructions to your product managers
23:53
wherein then they start picking it off for their products that they are responding
23:59
then this comes your lead product manager which is essentially a leadership position
24:04
for senior product managers with increased responsibility over multiple products or a significant product area.
24:10
Right? Uh overseeing the product strategy and execution for a portfolio of products. Right? Uh leading cost
24:17
functional teams to ensure cohesive product development st and delivery. Establishing and promoting best
24:22
practices. Setting and tracking key performance metrics for product success.
24:28
and working closely with senior leadership to align product initiatives and company goals.
24:35
So wherein you have let's say a portfolio therein when comes a leader lead product manager which is kind of
24:42
responsible for a section of the company's products right so let's say if
24:48
you have Ola right so Ola has your customer app
24:57
right you it has the driver side of app then it has a bunch of internal tools
25:04
Right? Spanning from marketing to finance, accounting, payouts, all of this. All right? So, let's say a lead
25:11
product manager will be somebody who will look at not everything but a lot of
25:17
portion around the driver app. All right. Just the driver app will have a lead product manager because it is not
25:23
just the driver app that they need to manage but also the various internal tools that and integrations
25:30
that driver tool. Right. So a couple of products is something that he will he or she will kind of
25:38
over. Then you have a principal product manager and your GPM, right? Principal
25:44
product is expert level person focused on high impact strategic initiatives across the organization.
25:52
Right? Driving strategic product initiative that have broad implications for the company. Identifying and
25:58
exploring new market opportunities and business. leading large scale product development efforts and cross functional
26:04
projects serving as a thought leader and expert within the product management community providing deep expertise and
26:09
mentorship to other product managers. Uh a group product manager is a managerial
26:14
position overseeing a team of product managers in a suit of products. Right? Uh managing and mentoring a team of
26:20
product managers overseeing the product strategy ensuring alignment facilitating
26:25
communications and reporting to senior leadership. Right? These essentially once you have bigger
26:33
and bigger products which have more impact then these levels start coming in as a principal product or a group
26:39
product right different companies have different terminologies right and different uh levels of
26:46
experience of when you become a principal when do you become a product group product manager right a lot of
26:53
companies I've seen have just product manager senior product manager and then
26:58
they directly the thing is is let's say a director product because the scope of
27:04
the product is smaller the impact of the entire product is much smaller right the width of the product is smaller so they
27:10
don't need a lot of hierarchy and a lot of roles but uh a company has multiple
27:17
all these roles right it has an APM PM GM then it principal PM then they have
27:25
something called as a DGM GM product then a VP product all of your
27:32
ATM is a much much much larger then these are your essentially leadership roles right the director
27:39
product VP product uh director product is a senior leadership responsible for the overall
27:45
direction and performance of the product management function setting the strategic direction for the product
27:50
management organization leading and developing a team ensuring alignment of product strategies
27:57
managing budget and resourc cost allocation representing the product management function and executive
28:03
decisions and VP product is an executive position right they they define the
28:08
vision and strategy they oversee the development and execution of product road maps ensuring alignment between
28:16
product strategies and company's overall business strategy right I think VP
28:21
product the main focus comes here where the alignment between product management
28:26
strategy and company overall business strategy becomes their key KPI right
28:33
driving product innovation long-term strategic planning representing product management and executive leadership
28:40
teams and then this is your CPO which is your top position right responsible for the overall product strategy
28:47
leading the entire product management organization setting the over product
28:52
vision and strategy driving product innovation and ensuring competitive differentiation
28:58
aligning product initiatives, working closely with the CEO and other se executives and representing the product
29:05
organization to the board of director. All right. So this is what I was talking about defining product vision and
29:11
strategy conducting market research planning and prioritizing stakeholder
29:17
one that we spoke about leading cross functional team collaborating with engineering design all that execution
29:23
and delivery and analyzing product manager versus project
29:28
management versus program management right so a product manager is responsible for the strategy road map
29:35
and feature definition of the Product responsibilities are vision and
29:41
strategy. Define the vision and strategic direction of the product. Market research. Conduct market research
29:46
to understand customer needs and market trends. Product road map. Create and maintain the product road map ensuring
29:52
alignment with business goals. Requirement gathering is collect and prioritize product requirements from
29:58
stakeholders. Stakeholder communication essentially communicate your product vision and
30:03
progress to your various stakeholders including executive, customers, development team, sales, marketing,
30:09
everyone. Feature prioritization right uh decide on the prioritization of features
30:15
and manage the backlog. Then you have your products life cycle management oversee the entire life cycle of the
30:22
product from concept to launch and then to decline and then to sort of uh
30:28
revamping it completely right uh I wouldn't want to say retirement because the product really never ends one it
30:35
changes it customer feedback is gather and analyze customer feedback to inform product
30:43
here is what they have defined of project manager right of Project manager responsible for planning, executing and
30:49
closing projects, ensuring they are completed on time, within scope and within
30:55
responsibilities. Project planning, resource management, budget management, risk management, right? Identify, assess
31:01
and mitigate the project risk, scheduling, create and maintain project schedules, ensuring timely delivery of
31:08
milestones, quality assurance, stakeholder communication and project.
31:13
The project management for planning, executing and closing ensuring they are completed on time within scope and within budget. This is the somebody who
31:21
is I remember somebody had asked difference between project and pro product
31:26
right versus product manager responsible for the strategy road map and so it's a
31:32
very different then you have a pro program managers. So
31:38
your program manager oversees a group of related pro projects which is essentially comprises of a program to
31:44
ensure they are managed and coordinated to achieve strategic. So they do program planning which is
31:50
define the program structure including objective scope and success criteria. They align with strategy. They do a lot
31:58
of resource coordination, allocate and manage resources across different projects. Interro coordination, risk and
32:05
issue management, performance monitoring, right? Overall performance and progress of the program, stakeholder
32:12
management, right? Uh engage with stakeholders to provide program updates and then benefit realization. Ensure
32:19
that the program delivers the intended benefits and value of the organ. So in a
32:24
Gish program manager is somebody who project manager plus
32:30
right because they are overseeing a group of relative. So this is a summary slide which kind of summarizes it for
32:36
you. Focus for a product manager is to focus on the product success, customer
32:42
satisfaction and market fit. For a project manager, it is to focus on delivering a specific project on time
32:47
within scope and budget. And for a program manager it is focused on the strategic alignment and coordination of
32:54
but scope is the product manager manages a single product line. Project manager
33:00
manages a single project. Program manager manages a group of related projects. Outcome for each of them is
33:06
ensure that the product meets the market needs for the product manager. Ensure that the project is completed
33:11
successfully according to the plan for the project manager and for the program manager. It is ensures that the delivers
33:17
its intended strategic benefit. Metrics everybody has their different metrics.
33:23
Product manager is through product metrics like adoption rates, revenue, customer satisfaction, reviews and
33:30
ratings. All of that also matter here. Project manager is through project metrics like on-time delivery, budget
33:37
adherence, scope completion. And for a program manager, it is through overall program ROI, alignment with strategic
33:44
goals and inter Service product management right I think somebody also spoke about this to will
33:52
this work for key aspect is service design right defining the service concept identifying customer needs and
33:59
designing the service process to deliver a high quality experience market research analyzing market trends
34:06
customer preferences landscape to inform service development and improvement
34:11
service development collaborating with various teams right customer experience, performance monitoring and cross
34:17
functionality. So irrespective of if you're building let's say your core
34:23
product or a service or anything right some of the things are very basic right you need to identify customer needs you
34:30
need to give them a great right you need to define what the product or the service concept will be
34:37
what the different all of this comes under right though it is called product management but that is
34:43
what it is in services your service is your All
34:48
right. And you still need to do all of these things to make sure that your service is successful and it is
34:54
differentiated customer from the competitors and that the customers love your service.
35:00
So this is what service product management kind here are some examples.
35:06
Healthcare teley health services managing development and improvement of teley health platforms ensuring they
35:12
meet patient needs comply with reg and integrate with existing health
35:20
patient care programs overseeing chronic disease management programs ensuring they provide con comprehensive support
35:28
then you have your finance mobile banking right develop financing mobile banking apps investment services
35:34
managing robo advisory plat platforms that provide automated all god driven financial services, right? Travel and
35:41
hospitality, right? Your loyalty programs, your travel packages. These are just forms of product management in
35:47
in travel and hospitality, right? Then telecommunications, your
35:52
ISPs, which is your internet service plans or service providers, right? developing or managing these different
35:59
internet service packages including speed tiers pricing additions and then
36:04
you have definitely have your customer support services which is enhancing customer support through chat bots
36:10
health service portals you have your online courses which is
36:15
what we are currently doing this is all but somebody at Intellipath thought
36:22
about okay we'll create this course this is how we'll differentiate it this is how we'll price it. This is what the mode of
36:28
teaching would be. This is the set of this will be the curriculum. All of this
36:34
is is if from a first principle objective is is all a product.
36:41
You have your software as a service which is managing your product like product project management softwares CRM
36:49
or right ensuring they offer features like real-time collaboration task
36:54
tracking and integration with other tools. You have CRM systems enhancing these systems to provide better customer
37:00
insights. Right? Then you have your retail platforms, your e-commerce
37:05
platforms obviously be on so optimize them including the website design, payment processing, delivery services,
37:12
right? Subscription services overseeing subscriptions based models for products
37:18
like meal kits, beauty box, transportation, right sharing services,
37:24
right? uh managing platforms for right sharing services focusing on user experience, driver partner support,
37:31
safety features, public transportation enhancing, public transportation services through apps and providing
37:36
real-time updates, ticket purchasing, road planning.
37:42
One very big example of service product management is the company called urban comp urban company.
37:50
They are connecting various service providers with you right through a product.
37:57
A fantastic example of service product. So sir, if you look at your travel
38:02
hospitality, there are two examples which are given here. One is your loyalty programs, right? Designing and
38:08
managing hotel and airline loyalty programs, right? So let's say you have your Vistara loyalty
38:15
or Air India or Emirates loyalty program, right? Somebody must have thought about it.
38:22
What is what how should I design my loyalty program? What are the different tiers? How many points should I give as
38:28
cash back or as loyalty points? How can the customers redeem these loyalty points? Right? Who should get this? When
38:35
should they get this? What should be the expiry for all these loyalty points? Uh
38:40
how can they redeem this? Is there a web platform for this? Can they go on website? They will call. Right? All of
38:46
these different things is somebody must needs to think about right what are the
38:52
different airlines doing out right uh let's say what is Air Asia doing what is
38:59
Cathy Pacific doing what is Indigo doing right they must have set these different benchmarks understood what what all they
39:06
doing and then tried to create their own program right where they can offer these
39:11
rewards and experience to enhance the customer loyalty to create a separate niche and differentiation for their
39:18
loyalty program. Right? When it comes to let's say travel packages, it is curating and managing
39:25
these travel packages that include flights, accommodation, experiences, right? So, if you go on make my trip,
39:31
you have a different section for travel packages where they let you see various packages. They can you can customize it,
39:39
right? You can book everything in one go. You can change the date, see the different prices, all of this. Now,
39:46
somebody had to kind of think about one the booking journey for the travel
39:51
packages for sure, but also what goes on behind. How will these five different things that are included in a travel
39:58
package get booked actually? Who are these vendors? How will all this
40:03
information go to all these vendors? and how will they kind of ensure that
40:09
whatever they have sold is actually met. So is what is a CRM right? It's a system
40:15
where in all your customer related data is kind of stored right your a lot of your processes your customer support
40:21
processes are managed from there your sales processes are managed from there right and as in
40:28
as your company keeps growing these processes keep changing as and when these processes keep changing right uh
40:36
the requirements within the CRM keep changing that okay now now I want to see
40:41
XYZ more data or this is someone more status that I
40:46
want to add in right all of these things are then kind of managed by a
40:52
so what is a PM versus a business analyst right so a business analyst focus on
40:59
understanding business needs analyzing processes and then providing datadriven recommendation to improve the business
41:05
outcomes right so a lot more focused on the business side of things right so
41:12
responsibilities are requirement ment analysis, right? Elicit, document and
41:17
manage these requirements from various internal stakeholders, right? Ensure ensure requirements align
41:23
with the business objectives. Process improvement is analyze the current business process. Identify areas for
41:29
improvement. Data analysis, documentation, right? Create detailed
41:35
documentation including business requirement documents, functional specifications, your stories, right?
41:41
maintain a clear organized record of business process. Stakeholder communication is facilitate
41:47
communication between business stakeholders and technical teams. Uh solution assessment is evaluate proposed
41:53
solutions to ensure that they meet business needs. Testing, validation and training and support. Right? uh that is
42:00
if you look at it prime responsibilities of a so if you look at here focus is for
42:09
a product manager as we already saw product success market fit customer satisfaction for a BA it is business
42:15
needs improving process providing actionable insights scope is the entire life cycle of a product from concept to
42:22
launch for a PM for a BA it is working on specific projects and initiatives to
42:28
analyze and improve Business processes for a PM the responsibilities are
42:33
involve strategic planning, market research, road map development as stakeholder communication, right? For a
42:39
BA involves requirement analysis, process improvement, data analysis, documentation and all of that bit.
42:46
Outcome is as we all know for a product manager meets market demands and business goals. for a BA it is
42:54
how are the business processes efficient effective and aligned right interaction with teams it BAS primarily interact
43:02
more internally a lot with business stakeholders project managers and technical teams to ensure solutions meet
43:07
the business skill set required for a product analytical
43:14
ability to analyze market data and user feedback very important right making datadriision datadriven decisions
43:22
Communication, clear and effective communication with stakeholders, ability to articulate product vision and strategy, writing detail product
43:28
requirements and documentation. Third is leadership, leading and motivating cross functional teams,
43:34
right? Fostering collaboration and driving team productivity, handling conflicts and making decision decision
43:39
decisive decisions, right? Very important as a product manager. You need to take decisions
43:47
a little I think very fast right you cannot keep waiting and get into a
43:54
analysis paralysis mode right uh because as a product manager the kind of data
44:00
that you will get is is come not very black and white right uh
44:06
you will get a lot of objective data you will have a lot of subjective data you will have your own thoughts you will
44:12
have your business leader ship thoughts, right? Everybody will have thoughts on your product because it kind of impacts
44:18
everybody's life. Ultimately, the decision is yours what to do next and you need to be very decisive and take a
44:26
call because you cannot keep waiting. The moment you start wasting time, your
44:31
competitors will zoom ahead and it'll become a bigger pain problem for you. So, it is better to take a decision
44:36
fast, fail fast, iterate, move out. And unfortunately in most organization
44:44
nobody wants to take decision because nobody wants to be responsible for let's say a failed decision but as a
44:52
product manager irrespect if the decision fails or passes you are the one responsible. So it is better that you
44:58
still take problem solving quickly identifying and addressing issues
45:03
developing innovative solutions. We all know this and navigating trade-offs.
45:09
Market and user research, understanding customer needs, market trends, conducting competitive analysis and usability testing, translating research
45:16
insights into actionable product features, technical knowledge, right? Understanding the technical aspects of
45:22
product, communicating effectively with your engineering team, balancing technical constraints with business
45:28
goals. I think this becomes also very important for a product manager. Be it
45:33
developing a car, be it developing an AC, be it developing an app or a website, you need to understand what
45:39
goes on in technically, right? Because only then can you make decisions. Can you think about innovations and the
45:48
future, right? Uh because you really don't know what are
45:54
the technical constraints of a product. Then you might think of oh we'll make these these things features and in the
46:02
end you will get to know from your engineering team that this will take three years while in your head because
46:07
you didn't know the technicalities of it you thought it's a very simple thing you this will get done in 3 weeks but
46:15
so it is more important very important for you to understand the test
46:20
you don't need to be an expert on it but you need to understand the technicalities
46:25
and strategic thinking, right? Develop a long-term vision for the product, right? Align it with your business objectives
46:32
and anticipate market changes and plan accordingly, right? So, keep an eye on what is the market saying, what are the
46:39
trends, what are the new companies in your space doing, right? Where you think the market can go let's say in the next
46:46
couple of years. Is your product and your product road map aligned to it? If
46:51
not, then please align it. Right? So a lot of strategic thinking will go in
46:57
meaning of product life cycle management. So as everything in life right the
47:04
products also go through a life cycle which is very similar to let's say a human being's life cycle if you relate
47:11
it right then the first is your ideation and
47:17
concept phase right wherein somebody thinks about the
47:23
product what it should be defines the product vision and strategic objectives creates the initial products prototypes
47:29
all of that Right? Then there's the development phase. Right? Where the product is started to get created.
47:37
Right? The engineering team, the design teams, everybody is involved in building that
47:43
product now. Right? You're you ensure your alignment with the product vision.
47:48
You monitor the development progress and you resolve roadblocks. All of that.
47:54
Right? Then the fi third one is your launch
47:59
right you coordinate with your different teams to launch it you get beta testing you gather feedback you prepare your
48:06
product documentation and training materials and then you oversee the release and monitor the monitor the
48:12
initial performance right so if you think of it just like a child life
48:18
parents think about having a child they have the child the child is born it is
48:24
when it is very young it is monitored in the hospital for a couple of days. All is good. It is breathing fine. No
48:30
issues. Different tests are run. All is good. Right? Now, if you look at it
48:35
next, the child will grow. Right? So, you will have a growing customer brace. The brand bending will be done,
48:42
distribution will be done, right? When the child is an adult, the growth will
48:47
escalate, right? Profit. There will be a growing demand. their first competitors.
48:54
Then probably there'll be a maturity phase, right? As in everybody's life where it kind of peaks for you. Your
49:00
growth stabilizes from a product perspective, you hit market saturation and then there will be
49:06
a decline phase as in all of us will eventually also have
49:12
a decline at the end of our life. Right? So as a core religious think of life and
49:19
the product they absolutely follow the same life cycle
49:25
right so your is your growth maturity and decline phase
49:31
in your go phase you will analyze user feedback and product performance metrics you will continually improve and update
49:37
the product identify opportunities and foster user engagement and retention strategies in your maturity stage
49:45
You'll optimize the product for peak performance and profitability. Manage product scaling,
49:51
explore new market segments, and plan for long-term sustainability. And then in the decline, you'll assess the
49:58
product viability, decide on product discontinuation or or revitalization.
50:03
Right? So if you look at it, most successful products when they hit this maturity
50:08
stage, they know that the decline will come soon. So they transform right there are
50:15
multiple ways to transform. A lot of companies what they do is they buy out different companies and integrate that
50:23
product into the current product so that they can extend the life cycle for it or they completely revamp the offering
50:30
looking at the customer trend. So just look at Google search for quite a few
50:35
years Google search has hit majority right it is the market is saturated everybody in the world is using Google
50:41
search but the whole new chat GPT and Poplex it started getting eating into
50:49
Google searches share right so Google now has sort of tried to counter it with
50:56
by bringing Gemini so when you go on Google and search now on the top you You will see Gemini answering certain
51:02
questions in that chat GP format for you right so that is a strategy that they are trying to extend the life cycle of
51:09
the product and so that it does not go into all right so your
51:14
introduction is your product launch a new smartphone model says that tech x1 is include introduced to the marketing
51:23
focus heavy marketing and promotion to build awareness right it could include advertising launch events
51:31
influencer partnerships, right? Your initial sales will definitely be slow as customers become aware of the product,
51:38
right? The company definitely is not profitable yet due to the high cost associated with the development and
51:43
marketing. Then there's the growth stage where the market accepts the product. Consumer begin to accept and buy the
51:52
new smartphone. Right? Tech X1 sales starts to increase.
51:57
The company will release software updates and accessories to enhance the smartphone appeal. Right? The the
52:03
feature sets will expand. Competition will notice the success and release similar models. Right? Profitability
52:10
will start coming in. Right? So sales volume increases leading to higher profitability as economy of scale reduce
52:16
the production. Then it will be the maturity stage where this smartphone has
52:22
reached its peak in terms of sales and market penetration. The market has become saturated,
52:27
right? To maintain sales, the company might introduce minor upgrades, new colors or bundled offers, there'll be
52:34
intense competition, right? Competition intensify the marketing efforts, possibly leading to price reductions
52:41
and steady profits. While slow sales growth slows down, the profit the product still generates these
52:49
and you'll have your decline. New models will come in, right? There they will start to capture the market. Customers
52:56
interest will shift from the old phone to the new technologies.
53:01
Company might reduce production cost, cast prices, offer discounts to clear the remaining inventory and eventually
53:07
the c the company will decide to phase out the old phone and stop production and focus on the latest and the newer
53:13
model. Managing the product life cycle. Introduction
53:18
company ensures a strong launch strategy, builds hype, ensures availability. During the growth phase,
53:24
they will continuously innovate and develop new marketing strategies to implement the to sustain the growth.
53:31
Right? In the maturity phase, efforts are made to differentiate the product and find new segments to sustain sales.
53:38
And then in the decline phase they will use strategies such as cost cutting finding secondary markets or product
53:45
modification that used to manage the decline.
53:50
Understanding product management and data analytics. Right? Data analytics involves connecting processing and
53:57
analyzing data to extract valuable insights.
54:02
Importance is informed decision making, understanding user behavior, performance
54:08
management and I think all of us in our various roles
54:14
already look at some bit of data right in some form or fashion and kind of do
54:20
all of these things already right so it's not like you don't understand the importance of data right so I will not
54:27
hop too much into exploratory data analysis and product management
54:32
So this involves using various techniques to understand data related to a product, uncovering
54:39
patterns, spotting anomalies, testing hypothesis, and checking assumptions.
54:45
Here's a detailed breakdown of what it entails. So collecting data rather collecting
54:52
data from various sources sources such as user interaction, sales records, customer feedback, etc. Then clean that
55:00
data, right? Finding missing values, correcting errors, formatting the data.
55:06
Then you have a basic stats which is calculating mean, median, mode, standard deviation,
55:12
other statistics, summarize that data, understanding, distribution of variables to see, data visualization, plotting it
55:20
into a histogram, bar chart, all of that pattern recognition, hypothesis. So if I
55:27
were to just simplify this slide without all this multiple jargon
55:33
is you collect your data right you bring it into an
55:38
understandable and all you need to do is identify
55:44
certain patterns and certain right we really don't need to know what
55:50
is a t test or a chai square test you don't need to be a statistics expert
55:55
here Right? You just need to go into your Excel, put it probably in a pivot,
56:01
in a bar graph. Right? You already have, let's say, of your using some tool like
56:06
Google Analytics, you will see your data there. You can also download it in an Excel.
56:12
But what you need is an I to identify certain outliers,
56:19
a observant mind to identify and a deep thinking brain to identify
56:26
why certain data points are wide.
56:32
All of these technical data analysis pieces will most probably be either done by the
56:39
tools that you are already using in your office or by a a specific data analytics
56:45
team that is there as a product manager. Nobody's
56:52
is expecting you to be a statistics champion. What is expected out of you is to look
57:00
at data and understand patterns and derive insights from it in whatever form or fashion you can.
57:07
So we'll come to the importance of it is again informed decision making
57:13
identifying user needs and behavior market segmentation performance metrics
57:19
assessing the success or the failure of the product features of the overall product health as well risk management
57:26
right identifying potential issues early through anomaly hypothesis generation for AB testing
57:33
so if I let's say if there's a website I'm seeing saying that with it from 7 to
57:39
9 there's a sudden spike in my traffic
57:44
right but that spike is not leading to a spike
57:49
in my sales as well only the number of people who are visiting to my website is increasing but not the conversion
57:56
then I will kind of generate a hypothesis of why that is happening
58:02
and then I will start AB testing and then that will validate what I'm thinking thinking
58:08
or prove me wrong and then bases that I can develop my
58:14
that is all we need to do as product managers look at data understand patterns
58:19
understand behaviors generate a hypothesis test it out and if it is validated then
58:26
build a product feature around all right so our next topic is
58:32
product vision and strategy all right now we're getting into the details of
58:37
product management. So, vision and mission alignment, aligning your product vision with the
58:43
company's mission, right? Defining and communicating the product vision, strategic planning, right? Long-term
58:50
planning, competitive analysis, market positioning and market research, market
58:55
and user research, right? So, research techniques, research strategy,
59:01
customer segmentation, personal development. All right? So let's deep dive into this.
59:10
This entire topic is so the vision vision statement outlines
59:17
what an organization aspires to achieve. Right? It is a forward-looking declaration that provides inspiration
59:23
and direction for the organization's long-term goals. The vision statement serves as a guide
59:29
for all strategic decisions and helps them align the efforts of all stakeholders towards a common future.
59:34
Right. Characteristics of a vision statement are it is one future oriented. It is inspirational and motivational. It
59:41
is clear and concise and it reflects the core values and the purpose of the organization.
59:47
Example is to be the world's most customercentric company where customers can find and discover anything they
59:52
might want to buy online. That is for Amazon. For Tesla, it is to accelerate
59:57
the world's transition to sustainable energy. Right? If you look at Tesla,
1:00:03
they're not even talking about cars or anything of the sort. It is a very inspirational
1:00:11
vision statement to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. Right? Hence, if you look at
1:00:16
what Tesla is developing, it's not just the car, it is also the gigafactory, the batteries, technology, all of that bit.
1:00:23
Right? Because all of this leads to a sustainable. Key differences between a vision and
1:00:28
mission, right? Vision is future oriented while mission is present focused.
1:00:34
Purpose for the vision is to offer inspiration and direction for the future while a mission defines the current
1:00:40
purpose and primary objectives. Scope is vision is broad and aspirational. Mission is specific and actionable.
1:00:48
Right? That is why if you look at it the army has a mission to capture XYZ peak.
1:00:57
Right? It is now it is very specific and it has a specific action to it. All
1:01:03
right. While the vision if you look vision if you look at Tesla right
1:01:09
oh I think I skipped a slide is to build sustainability. So
1:01:16
mission statement defines the organization's purpose and primary objectives. It focuses
1:01:23
on the present and explains why the organization exists, what it does and for whom.
1:01:29
Right? So characteristics of a mission statement is present, focused, specific, practical. Defines the organizing
1:01:35
purpose, goals and approach and addresses the needs of key stakeholders. So example is given to organize the
1:01:42
world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. For Google, for Starbucks, it is to inspire
1:01:48
and nurture the human spirit. one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time. That is their mission.
1:01:56
So yeah, we were talking about differences between vision and mission, right? Scope is for the vision is broad
1:02:02
and aspirational. Mission is specific and actionable. Time frame is vision looks at it from a long-term goal
1:02:09
perspective while mission addresses the current ops and the short-term objectives.
1:02:14
Importance is alignment, right? Vision and mission statements help align the organization's strategies and actions
1:02:20
with its core values and long-term goals. Communication, right? They effectively communicate the organization
1:02:25
purpose and direction to employees, customers and other stakeholders. Motivation, they inspire and motivate
1:02:32
employees by providing a sense of purpose and direction and decision making. They serve as a framework for
1:02:37
making strategic and operational decisions. Right? So if it it kind of aligns with your mission and vision then
1:02:45
probably the decision is right. If it does not then it is probably not.
1:02:51
Aligning product vision with company mission. Right? This is where your
1:02:56
product management kind of comes into play. So aligning product vision with the company mission
1:03:02
means ensuring that the goals, features and direction of a product are in
1:03:09
harmony with the company's core purpose and objectives. This involves creating a product vision
1:03:15
that reflects and supports the company's mission, values, and strategic priorities.
1:03:20
Steps to align product vision with company mission. Right? Ensure that everyone involved in product development
1:03:26
fully understand the company's mission, values, and strategic goals. Right? The
1:03:32
vis mission statement should clearly communicate the purpose of the company and its primary objectives. Define the
1:03:39
product vision. Right? Create a product vision that is aspirational and outline the long-term goals and future
1:03:44
directions of the product. Ensure that the product vision reflects the core values and the purpose.
1:03:51
Set clear goals, right? Smart goals. All of us know smart, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound
1:03:56
goals. These goals should support the company's overall strategy. Right? If you remember in the start, I said very
1:04:03
important that your product goals should align with the company's goals. If the company's goal is to increase sales,
1:04:10
your product goal should be to increase sales. If the company's goal is to improve customer experience,
1:04:17
your product goal should be the same. Right? Align strategies and techniques. Develop strategies and techniques for
1:04:24
the product that are consistent with the company's mission. Ensure that every feature, update, and marketing effort
1:04:29
for the product supports the company's purpose. Engage stakeholder, right? Communicate
1:04:34
the aligned vision and mission to all stakeholders. Ensure that everybody understands how the product contributes
1:04:40
to the company's vision and strategic goals. And obviously regularly review and adapt, continuously review and adapt
1:04:46
the product vision to ensure that it remains aligned, right? and use any feedback and performance metrics to make
1:04:53
the necessary adjustments. So third importance is consistency and
1:04:58
focus, right? It ensures that all efforts are consistent focused on achieving the same overarching goals.
1:05:05
Employee motivation and engagement. When employees understand how their work on a product contributes to the company's
1:05:10
mission, they're more likely to be motivated. This is very important when you're sort of explaining what your
1:05:16
product does or what you want the product to do to your development and your design teams, right? Because they
1:05:22
are the ones who will be building it, right? So, you need to explain it to them in a very clear and concise way.
1:05:31
Customer satisfaction. Products that reflect the company's mission are more likely to meet customer expectations.
1:05:36
Right? Strategic coherence. Align product vision with the company's mission.
1:05:42
ensure strategic coherence, making it easier to prioritize initiatives and allocate resources and long-term
1:05:48
successes. Products that support and enhance the company's mission are more likely to contribute to long-term
1:05:53
success and sustainable. So, here are some examples, right? For
1:05:59
Apple, the company mission is to bring the best user experience to its customer through innovative hardware, software,
1:06:05
and services. on the product vision. Focus on creating products that are
1:06:10
beautifully designed, easy to use, and seamlessly integrated across the Apple ecosystem. Every product from the iPhone
1:06:17
to the MacBook and the Apple Watch reflects this mission by prioritizing user experience, design, and mission,
1:06:24
right? We can all see that in Apple's products. The best user experience, innovative hardware, software, and the
1:06:31
service. Tesla is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. Right?
1:06:37
The product vision is to create electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions
1:06:42
that are desirable, high performance, and accessible. So Tesla's electric cars
1:06:48
like the Model S, Model 3, the solar energy products all aim to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and promote
1:06:54
sustainable energy. Right? Again, complete alignment. Google
1:07:01
organize world's information right so if you look at all its products is to provide tools and platform that help
1:07:07
people find information quickly and efficiently Google search map Google drive all of it right provides an easy
1:07:15
access to vast amounts of information um again Amazon most customercentric
1:07:22
company right Amazon support we all know prime delivery Alexa, AWS all enhance
1:07:30
the customer experience here. We are in the business to save our home
1:07:36
planet, right? That is Patagonia's mission. So vision is to create highquality sustainable
1:07:43
outdoor and gear that reduces environmental impact.
1:07:48
So they use recycled materials, ethical sourcing, environmental activism is reflected in their product directly
1:07:55
supporting their mission. IKEA again to create a better everyday life for many people. So again if you look at the
1:08:03
product vision is to offer wide range welldesigned functional home furnishing that price very low. All right. So that
1:08:10
is why that is how they're helping every to create a better everyday life for so
1:08:15
many people. Microsoft is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to
1:08:22
achieve more. Right? So that is why it's different solutions increase
1:08:27
productivity, creativity and collaboration products like Microsoft Office, Windows Azure. All of this Nike
1:08:34
is to bring inspiration and innovation to every a
1:08:39
so the product vision is to create product that enhance athletic performance and promote an active lifestyle. So they focus on athletic
1:08:46
wear, cutting edge, sneaker technology and motivational campaign that align with this entire
1:08:53
mission. So defining product vision. So a product vision document is a comprehensive guide
1:09:00
that outlines the future direction, goals and purposes purpose of a product.
1:09:06
It serves as a road map for the development teams and stakeholders providing clarity and alignment of the
1:09:11
product's objectives. These are the key components, right?
1:09:17
Let's just go first to the highle components. So one is product overview.
1:09:23
Second is vision statement. Third is target market and audience. Fourth is the value proposition. Fifth is the
1:09:30
product goals and objectives. Sixth is key features and requirements.
1:09:35
FE is competitive analysis, market analysis, stakeholders and their roles,
1:09:41
road map and timeline, metrics and KPIs, risk and mitigation strategies, budget
1:09:46
and resources, and then you have your additional documents. All right, so these are your 14 key components of a
1:09:53
product vision document. Now let's go into the details of each
1:09:58
one of them. Product overview is a concise summary of the product, its purpose and the core functionality. Then
1:10:04
you have a vision statement, right? An aspirational statement that describes the long-term goals and the desired
1:10:10
future state, right? A mission statement that outlines the primary purpose of the
1:10:15
product and how it aims to achieve the vision that you've kind of stated. Then
1:10:20
you have your target market and audience. You have your market segments, your specific segments or customer
1:10:25
groups that the product is intended for. And then you have your user persona which is your detailed description of
1:10:32
ideal users including demographies, needs, pain points, all of that bit.
1:10:38
Value proposition is your USP, your customer benefits, what makes the product unique, right? Why should
1:10:44
customers choose it over competitors or also in general, right? What the benefits that they get
1:10:50
out of it? Your long-term and your short-term objectives.
1:10:56
So long-term goals are your overarching goals that product aims to achieve in the long run. Then your short-term
1:11:02
objectives which are your specific measurable objectives that support
1:11:08
key features and requirements right you have your core feature which is a highle
1:11:14
list of the essential features and functionalities. Then you have your requirements which is a DT
1:11:19
non-functional requirement that the product must
1:11:24
competitive analysis right your list of competitors in the market analysis of the product's strength and weakness
1:11:30
relative to the competitor and how it will differentiate itself. Then you have your market analysis what are the
1:11:37
current trends in the market right estimates of the market size and growth potential. Then you have your SWAT
1:11:44
analysis related to the product and the market. And let's say you can also do a SWAT
1:11:49
analysis on your company stakeholders and roles. You have your identification of sta all the
1:11:55
stakeholders in the product development including internal team external partners all of this right and clearly
1:12:03
define each stakeholders roles and responsibilities. Road map is a visual representation of
1:12:09
the major milestones, features and phases of the development process. And the timeline indicates the expected date
1:12:16
for each milestone and the feature release. Metrics and again the the KPIs and
1:12:23
metrics that will be used to measure the success of the product. How and when these metrics will be
1:12:29
measured and reported is your measurement. Risk and mitigation strategies.
1:12:35
identification of potential risk and challenges that could impact the product development, right? Your your potential
1:12:40
risk and then your strategies and actions to mitigate or manage these risks.
1:12:48
Budget and resources. Budget estimates, right? Estimated budget for the product
1:12:53
development costs and resource allocation is information on the resources, who will work, what
1:12:59
are tools needed, all of that built. and then your appendices which is any
1:13:04
additional documents research or data that supports the vision and the plan. So by doing all of this you kind of
1:13:11
create your product vision. So here is an example.
1:13:17
Support AI is the product name, right? They've given a beef discussion
1:13:22
description is an advanced AI powered customer support tool designed to streamline
1:13:28
customer interactions, improve response times and enhance customer satisfaction through intelligent automated.
1:13:35
So vision statement is to revolutionize customer support with AIdriven solutions
1:13:40
that enhance c user satisfaction and operational efficiency.
1:13:46
The mission is to provide businesses with intelligent automated support tools that reduce response times and improves
1:13:52
service quality. They have defined the target margin
1:13:58
market and market segment ismemes, large corporations, e-commerce businesses,
1:14:04
tech startups. User personas, right? The users who will kind of be using it is your customer
1:14:10
support managers seeking to reduce workload and improve efficiency. IT admin focused on integrating the tool
1:14:17
and end users which is customers interacting with support for quicker. Value proposition is what are the USPS
1:14:24
AIdriven response that handle common queries seamless integration 247 surve 7
1:14:30
availability and support customer benefits is reduced response time significant cost savings and improved
1:14:36
customer satisfaction and retention long-term goal is to become the leading
1:14:42
AI customer support tool in the global market within 5 years short-term objective is to launch the beta version
1:14:48
by Q2 on board 50 pilots customers by Q3 and achieve a customer
1:14:54
satisfaction score of 90% in the first year. Right? Key features and
1:15:00
requirements. Core features they have mentioned are automated responses to common queries, sentiment analysis to
1:15:05
God, customer emotion and multi- channelannel support, email to media. Requirements are that it needs to have a
1:15:11
high accuracy and AI generated responses. It needs to have a user-friendly interface for both support
1:15:17
agents and customers. and it should be scalable to handle increasing volumes of queries. Then they did a competitive
1:15:24
analysis of competitors. So ABC Corp, support B, BF company, they've listed
1:15:30
these as competitors. What are the competitive advantages? Superior AI technology with higher accuracy. Lower
1:15:37
pricing compared to competitors. Comprehensive support and customization.
1:15:44
Market analysis. So that they'll listing of the trends market trends that there's
1:15:49
an increased adoption of AI and customer support. There's a growing demand for 24/7 customer service solutions.
1:15:58
Market size and growth is estimated size of the market is 10 billion with a 15% growth rate. They did a SWAT rights
1:16:05
strength is advanced AI technology weakness is early stage product with limited penetration. Opportunity is high
1:16:11
demand for AI solutions. threat is intense competition and rapid advancements in technology.
1:16:17
They have listed out their key stakeholders, development team, marketing team, investors, customers,
1:16:23
right? Define the roles and responsibilities for each. For the development team is to build
1:16:29
features, marketing to conduct market research, develop promotional strategies, investor is to fund
1:16:34
development, offer business insight and customers to provide feedback and suggestions. Then they have a product
1:16:40
road map and timeline. Phase one beta release by phase Q2. Phase two is
1:16:45
feature enhancements by Q3 and then full launch and marketing blitz by Q4.
1:16:51
Timelines is Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. These are the things that we will
1:16:57
matrix and KPIs. Success matrix they have defined as user adoption rate, customer satisfaction
1:17:04
score and retention rate. Measurement plan is monthly reporting on adoption and
1:17:10
satisfaction, quarterly customer service and real-time usage analytics.
1:17:17
Risk and mitigation strategies. Potential risk is to potential risk are AI accuracy leading
1:17:23
issues leading to customer dissatisfaction, delayed launch due to development setbacks. What are the
1:17:29
mitigation planners? Rigorous testing and QA process. Right? And you keep buffer time in the project schedule to
1:17:35
handle any delays. Budgets and resources. Budget is 1 million for development, 500,000 for
1:17:43
marketing, 200,000 for operations and support
1:17:48
resources. 10 developers, five marketers, two project managers. Any additional information is the
1:17:55
detailed market research data, user feedback report from beta testing and technical documentation for integration.
1:18:04
So this is a product we market and user research. So the first one what we already spoke about right
Market and User Research
1:18:10
opportunity identification. So market sizing estimate the total addressable market by looking at let's say global
1:18:17
travel and tourism statistics. This is what they're talking for the hotel booking app that we we looking at,
1:18:23
right? So, we'll look at the entire market size, right? Then we look at growth trends, analyze trends like
1:18:29
increasing use of mobile devices for booking, preference for personalized travel experiences and the rise of
1:18:34
lastminute booking trends, competitive landscape, assess competitors such as booking.com, Airbnb, others. Identify
1:18:41
their market share strengths and weaknesses and then do a SWAT analysis. Right? Identify your software's
1:18:47
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Right? Consumer analysis, segmentation. Segment the market into
1:18:54
business travelers, vacationers, budget travel, all of these different ones. And then identify gaps like lack of
1:19:00
personalized recommendations, limited options for eco-friendly accommodations or booking process or something of that
1:19:06
sort, right? And then you look at customer pain points. Understand issues such as hidden fees, inaccurate
1:19:13
descriptions, poor service, right? Then there's something called as environmental scanning. So pest analysis
1:19:20
porters five forces these are just ways to sort of map the current market and
1:19:26
environment. So political pest is political, economic, social and technological, right? Political is
1:19:32
regulations, government regulations. Is the government pro this or against this?
1:19:38
All of that the markets specifically, right? uh economics is economic
1:19:43
downdowns or what is the current market economics are we looking at a recession in the next few years or or is there
1:19:50
going to be a dip in travel or something of that sort social is growing preference for experiential travel we
1:19:55
all know this and then technological is advancements in AI and ML right and how we can leverage them in multiple ways
1:20:04
five forces are threats of new entrance sorry five forces right threat of new entrance bargaining power of supplier
1:20:09
bargaining power of buyer threat Rate of substitute and industry rivalry, right? So threat of new entrance is low due to
1:20:16
high entry value. Let's say bargaining powers of suppliers is medium. Hotels can list on multiple platforms.
1:20:21
Bargaining power of buyers is very high because they can easily switch platforms. Threat of substitutes is medium. Direct total bookings I think it
1:20:28
is you can just call it as well. Barely I've seen people book directly, right? And then industry is high because there
1:20:35
are many established players. So this one thing that I wanted to kind of uh add here is when we are doing market
1:20:42
analysis right u and let's say uh the business is for for India specifically
1:20:50
is what I'm talking about right uh the first thing or the easiest thing that we
1:20:55
can do and this is a hack that I kind of just discovered once was list down all
1:21:02
your competitors all right big small ugly whoever it is right. As long as
1:21:08
it's a private limited or let's say a limited company, a public limited
1:21:13
company, go to the MCA website, pull out their financials for whatever the last 3
1:21:19
4 years and then see that data, right? So let's say if I want to build something like a urban company today the
1:21:27
first thing I will do obviously after this market analysis sizing all of that bit is go to MCA pull out urban
1:21:35
companies data and see how they are fairing right if I see that there's no growth in sales profits all of these bit
1:21:44
then it also gives me an indication that this is not a very easy market to crack right so then the thought process
1:21:51
becomes what is the problem with urban company why are they not being able to make profit why are they not being able to increase their sales right is there
1:21:58
something that they're doing wrong or is it just the market is such right and then my idea gets a lot more smoother
1:22:06
this is something I see a lot of people not doing right and whoever I meet
1:22:12
whenever somebody wants to discuss an idea I just go and tell them please do this first right and especially when
1:22:18
you're building something from scratch when you're building something already on top of something, try and speak with
1:22:25
the product managers or people in the competitor space, right? To get some
1:22:31
idea data about how let's say that feature or that section that you want to build also on your app is fairing,
1:22:38
right? This data becomes very important for you to further down streamline your processes. Cool. So, political factors,
1:22:46
regulations, legislations, right? uh government regulations regarding food safety, hygiene standards, labor laws,
1:22:52
right? We need to figure them out. Tax policies especially food delivery related uh GST is a very big one, right?
1:23:00
Uh when do you apply GST, when do you not apply GST, who pays GST, all of that bit employment laws, right? Gigonomy
1:23:07
workers, what what are the rights that they have? What are some responsibilities as a employer that you
1:23:13
kind of have? figuring all that out and then you have your trade policies of importing food ingredients but if you're
1:23:18
just a delivery service I don't think trade policies really matter to us right now right but if let's say if we are a manufacturing unit and we are importing
1:23:25
something from China from some other country then we definitely need to look at this then you have economic factors
1:23:31
like growth inflation rates disposable income and employment rates right this just gives us an idea of is it a growing
1:23:38
market does the consumer have the propensity to pay and the willingness to pay right where the market going from a
1:23:44
economic standpoint tomorrow, right? Is there any challenges that we foresee? Because it's as simple food delivery
1:23:51
apps will keep growing as long as your disposable income in the country keeps growing, right? There's a direct
1:23:56
correlation for it. Social factors, lifestyle changes, right? Uh health consciousness, urbanization, demography.
1:24:03
So these things have come into play a lot now, right? Especially when you talk about food delivery and food services,
1:24:10
you see a lot of chatter around healthy food, right? You see a lot of chatter on lifestyle changes. Oh, I want to do
1:24:17
this, I want to do that. So, where do you kind of fit in this entire segment,
1:24:22
right? And how does these things affect what the idea or the product that you're kind of wanting to build? And then you
1:24:28
have your technology factors, mobile technology, payment systems, logistics, delivery, right? Data analytics. So if
1:24:35
you just look at what Zeppto did, I think it just played very well on the whole technology angle, right? It it
1:24:42
cracked its supply chain using technology so that they can deliver within 10 minutes and then it then
1:24:48
Zeppto is what Zepto is today, right? So these are the five porters five force
1:24:54
analysis, right? for the same one. Threat of new entrance is moderate here because low capital requirements because
1:25:01
you just need to build an app right and connect to people. So building a marketplace is usually less capital as
1:25:07
compared to setting up a restaurant per se, right? Technology and app development. Develop a userfriendly app
1:25:14
right can be a significant barrier. Technology is becoming more accessible. I don't think this is a barrier now. Uh
1:25:19
this is the one of the simplest things that uh can be done, right? Brand loyalty is yes this is a big one
1:25:26
established players are already there how do you make your name in this and then economies of scale larger companies
1:25:32
benefit from economies of scale right which can be challenging for a new entrant bargaining power of suppliers
1:25:38
low to moderate the industry relies on relies on a wide range of restaurants making it difficult for any single
1:25:44
supplier to exert significant power right because you will tie up with 1,000
1:25:49
restaurants it's okay one or two can act a little funky And it's fine. Many food items are commoditized, right? Reducing
1:25:56
their bargaining power and dependency, right? Uh popular highquality restaurants can have some bargaining
1:26:01
power but the vast majority do not. Bargaining power of buyers is very high.
1:26:06
We already understand this because multiple apps are there, right? Which we can switch from. It is a very price
1:26:13
sensitive market. I can see on rumato. I can see on see which one is cheaper. Multiple restaurants. There are online
1:26:19
reviews and ratings which can tell me which one is good, bad, ugly. So bargaining power of buyers is very high
1:26:24
here. Threat of substitute products or services. The substitute threat high I would say it is medium. Right?
1:26:31
Traditional dining out at restaurants remains a strong substitute but it is the frequency is much much lesser than
1:26:38
delivery service frequency. Home cooking yes it's it's a decent threat right cooking at home is a cost effective and
1:26:44
healthier method. Pickup services nobody does that I think. And you have your industry rivalry. Competition is very
1:26:50
high. Numerous competitors. There are price wars, right? Companies keep innovating and differentiating their
1:26:56
offerings through partnerships, subscriptions, coupons, all of that bit, right? And they spend a lot obviously on
1:27:03
marketing and advertising. So in market and user research, how do we do
1:27:08
targeting? Right? So first is segment evaluation, second is target market selection, and third is our positioning,
1:27:15
right? So segment evaluation consists of attractiveness right evaluate segments
1:27:21
like budget travelers for their size, growth potential, profitability, fit, right? Assess how well each segment
1:27:27
aligns with your solutions strengths, right? And then competitive positioning.
1:27:33
Determine potential for differentiation. I think we discussed all of these things in our previous discussion, right? So I
1:27:39
hope you guys can relate to what we had already discussed and what is written on this slide. Target market selection,
1:27:45
right? Prioritization, prioritize segments like let's say vacationers seeking personalized travel due to their
1:27:52
high growth potential and alignment and then we create personas travelers who value sustainable travel options and
1:27:58
personalized recommendations. Positioning is how do we differentiate it? What is our USP? So differentiate by
1:28:04
unique differentiate by offering unique features like AIdriven recommendations, eco-friendly hotels, seamless mobile
1:28:12
journeys and uh USB right USB is book the perfect stay personalized just for
1:28:18
you discover eco-friendly hotels and hidden gems with our advanced AI
1:28:24
recommendations. So this product if you look at it it is targeting vacationers
1:28:30
seeking personalized travel right their persona of the traveler is somebody who
1:28:35
values sustainable travel options and personalized recommendations hence their different differentiation and USP is
1:28:42
this right after that is creating a value proposition right so that involves
1:28:48
essentially value proposition development validation and communication so what are the core benefits right
1:28:55
highlight benefit benefits like let's say easy discovery seamless booking eco-friendly choices and then the
1:29:00
emotional and functional benefits appeal to the desire for hassle-free travel satisfaction of making eco-friendly
1:29:07
conscious choices right this is very important it's not in some products you can just harp on the functional benefits
1:29:14
right but what I've learned even in a product which you think is just a functional product the emotional angle
1:29:20
if you bring in then it actually sort of builds a customer trust and loyalty much
1:29:26
better. Right? So the emotional sort of exploring the emotional angle is very important. And then there's the value
1:29:34
proposition canvas. Map out how your software addresses customer jobs. So
1:29:39
jobs are essentially what are different jobs that a customer has to do to book. So booking hotels, booking flights,
1:29:46
let's say booking transfers, all of these. Then what are the pains, right? complex booking processes, hidden fees,
1:29:53
and what are they gaining out of it? Personalized recommendations, eco-friendly options, validation, right?
1:29:59
Customer feedback. Conduct surveys and focus groups with target users to gather feedback on the value prop. And then run
1:30:05
pilots with small users to validate these features, right? And this will
1:30:10
give you more confidence if the idea is really working or not. If it is not working, then you need to pivot. If it
1:30:17
is working, then you build a full-fledged product around this. And then the communication is messaging, storytelling and brand polishing. So we
1:30:24
need to develop a clear messaging right let's say the messaging here is find the perfect hotel effort effortlessly
1:30:30
personally recommend and eco-friendly choices at your fingertips. Storytelling use stories of users who found unique
1:30:36
and memorable stays right uh brand positioning. Position your software as a go-to platform for personalized
1:30:41
eco-friendly hotel bookings. After this comes your implementation and monitoring. That is your goto market
1:30:47
strategy. Right? A go to market strategy is essentially a plan that outlines how a company will launch a product and
1:30:54
ensure its success in the market. It involves defining the target market, identifying the value proposition and
1:31:01
creating a plan for reaching and engaging customers. It again consists of multiple things. First is your
1:31:07
segmentation and targeting, right? Second is your value proposition, right?
1:31:13
Third is the marketing and promotional strategies, right? folds is your sales strategy, your distribution strategy,
1:31:20
your pricing strategy, your customer retention strategy and then your metrics, your risk management, right?
1:31:27
All of these things combined kind of make your go to market strategy. So how
1:31:33
can I exactly predict position of my product? They are harping on is are two
1:31:39
things essentially right AIdriven personalized recommendations and eco-friendly hotels. So that is what
1:31:44
their positioning is that it is personalized for you and second you will discover eco-friendly hotels and hidden
1:31:50
gems. So basis because they figured that in the market these two things are missing right. So they build these
1:31:56
features and now they're positioning it such for people who who want personalized recommendations and let's
1:32:02
say eco-friendly hotels we are building a product for you and that is where they have positioned themselves in the market. So if you do let's say a matrix
1:32:09
of the market one will be let's say a generic product for all customers which will be your let's say booking.com or
1:32:15
clearrip.com right on let's say one access will be your experiential travelers who are looking for very let's
1:32:23
say niche eco-friendly options and in that quadrant is somewhere where we will
1:32:28
lie the positioning will be created by the product team along with all the
1:32:34
different teams together right so your you have your segmentation where you can define demographies, right?
1:32:40
Basis age groups, uh disposable income, all of that. You have your geographies,
1:32:45
right? Which is very straightforward. And then you have your behavior techsavvy individuals who value all of
1:32:52
these things, right? U then your targeting is primary targeting. So they are talking about uh the food delivery
1:32:58
service, right? The targeting is primarily the urban professional and students in metro areas, right? And
1:33:04
secondary is families who prefer the convenience of home delivery and local restaurants. They have defined the value
1:33:10
proposition as convenience, customization and transparency. Right? For the customer, for the restaurants,
1:33:17
it is obvious increased reach, efficient ops, support. For the delivery partners,
1:33:23
it's flexibility, earnings and and support, right? Then you have your marketing and promotional strategies. So
1:33:30
they want to do a pre-launch which is teaser campaigns, beta testing, right? And partnerships. We also spoke about
1:33:36
partnerships a little where Libi said that for the food pet food he will want to partner with Suki Zamato, right? So
1:33:43
partnership is also a great way of getting large distribution instantly.
1:33:49
Then they have the launch event where let's say like Apple has their launch event every year, Google has their
1:33:55
launch event. So they want to do a launch event. Then they obviously do social media marketing, influencer
1:34:00
marketing and referral programs. Then post launch they'll keep churning out content, email marketing, promotion,
1:34:06
discounts and SEO and SEM, right? Beta testing is before you are rolling it out
1:34:13
to what is beta testing? Beta testing is essentially you have defined a small audience, right? And you are providing
1:34:19
them that service. So before launching it to the world, you are sort of testing it. Now beta testing can happen in
1:34:26
multiple ways. Let's say when Tata new the Tata new app was launched they did like a one two year of beta testing
1:34:33
internally with only Tata employees because they obviously they have several lakh employees right so there are
1:34:38
multiple ways so let's say one of my companies when we did that built a product we identified four or five of
1:34:44
let's say these mobile stores that we had good relationships with right and we set them to start using our products and
1:34:51
we monitored the product usage issues all of that over a period of 3 months we identified issues fixed them identified
1:34:58
more features to be added did that and then we finally did a launch to everyone then we'll have a sales strategy so
1:35:04
let's say direct sales with restaurants right enterprise solution providing corporate clients with solutions for
1:35:09
office meal delivery customer acquisition is app store optimization
1:35:15
right so ensure high visibility in app store through optimized descriptions keyword so if somebody's on goes on the
1:35:20
app store and searches for food delivery your app should sort of come up there right customer support obviously we have
1:35:26
to offer excellent customer support, distribution strategy, right? Mobile app
1:35:31
platforms is launched both on iOS and Android, right? Make it obviously user friendly. The web app is responsive
1:35:38
design and cross promotion. So, promote the web app through the mobile app and vice versa to drive traffic to both
1:35:45
platforms. Right? So in a distribution strategy if you have an app right and a website what I've normally seen is uh
1:35:52
people drive traffic to the website initially and then make people download the app because downloading an app is a
1:35:59
little more cumbersome journey because there are multiple steps. You'll see an ad, you'll click, you'll go to the play
1:36:05
store, right? There'll be an install button. You'll install it, then open, login, all of that. While on a website
1:36:10
when you see ad, you directly click on it and you would directly land on the required page, right? And you can start
1:36:16
doing what you want to do. So, if uh I remember correctly when urban company
1:36:22
started off, right, what they did is they ran ads primarily on desktop, right? diverted traffic to their
1:36:28
website, took the orders there and once they took the orders, they asked people to download the app to track the
1:36:34
service, get the service partner details and all of that. That is was their initial distribution strategy.
1:36:41
If uh if you guys are interested and have the time, please uh study about the
1:36:47
distribution strategy that Microsoft Teams used, right? Uh so Slack was the
1:36:54
world's favorite, right? tool for communication and office communication all of that. Then
1:36:59
Microsoft launched teams. Since everybody in the world uses Microsoft
1:37:04
automatically everybody had Teams, right? So since they owned the entire distribution channel, Teams then just
1:37:12
took an accelerated path and Slack was left behind. Let me Google if I can
1:37:17
Google. And yeah, look at this graph. Slack was there for the longest time.
1:37:24
Teams came in later and since they own the entire distribution of everybody hired Microsoft it just took took off
1:37:31
right and Slack is a better product if you ask me as compared to Microsoft teams but just because of distribution
1:37:38
this teams just worked better right pricing strategy right uh there are
1:37:44
various pricing strategies uh we'll just talk about competitive pricing here but there's reference pricing there is uh
1:37:50
penetration pricing right there's value based pricing which is a separate module in itself.
1:37:55
Right? So they're talking only about competitive pricing, right? They are delivery fees which set competitive
1:38:02
delivery fees and offer occasional free delivery and then they have a subscription model with benefits like
1:38:07
free deliveries exclusive discounts and priority customer support promotions obviously all of us know offer
1:38:13
discounted rates for first-time users limited time offers loyalty programs right engagement personalization use AI
1:38:20
to provide personalized recommendation and special offers right uh uh you know if you guys remember Swiggy has this one
1:38:27
coupon code you when you order from the same restaurant after a few days or
1:38:32
weeks you get automatically get a coupon called missed you right uh that is nothing but a combination of promotions
1:38:38
plus personalization right feedback loop is regularly solid solicit and act on customer feedback obvious loyalty
1:38:45
programs I think we've already covered then you have your metrics you have your CAC clv rate NPS CAC is nothing but the
1:38:54
cost of acquiring new customers right how much are you spending on marketing to acquire one customer, right? That
1:38:59
becomes your CAC. Customer lifetime value is the total value a customer brings over the entire relationship. So
1:39:05
let's say with Swiggy or Zamato, they normally see that one user will order for 5 years, three times a week, average
1:39:12
order value 200. So the hence the customer lifeline value will become whatever 60 into 200 into 4 probably,
1:39:20
right? That becomes their customer lifetime value. Then there's a churn rate which is track the rate at which
1:39:25
customers stop using the service. Right? So if I have 100 users today, right, and
1:39:30
then next month 30 fell off, then I have a churn of 30%. Right? Net promoter
1:39:36
score is assess customer satisfaction and likelihood to recommend quick hits. All of us know that a lot of apps ask
1:39:43
this question, right? Are you satisfied? How likely are you recommend to somebody else? Right? Then you have your
1:39:49
operational metrics. Your financial metrics like operational metrics are average delivery time, accuracy rate,
1:39:56
app performance. Financial metrics are revenue growth, profit margin, market share, right? And then is your risk
1:40:01
management, competition, differentiation, customer loyalty, right? Differentiation is continuously
1:40:07
innovate and offer unique features. So you can see the innovation war between Zumato and Sugi today, right? One brings
1:40:13
in a new feature within two weeks the other brings in, then somebody else will bring in a new feature, both of them
1:40:18
will bring something new, right? So there's a innovation war as well going on here, right? Customer loyalties
1:40:25
obviously build a strong brand and loyal customer base to withstand competitive pressures. It's not like Swiggy and
1:40:31
Zomato were the only delivery partners. There were multiple of these apps which came which came in probably around 2017
1:40:38
18 was a surge of all of this right and most of them died. operational risk,
1:40:44
right? Technology, delivery logistics, right? Ensure a robust technology infrastructure. We've all seen apps
1:40:50
going down once a few more users come in. Delivery logistics, we all again are very aware of what many issues come in,
1:40:58
right? Especially peak times, the delivery times just go beyond 1 hour, 1 and a half hour, 2 hour. Sometimes they
1:41:04
don't turn up, right? So, you have to manage all these risks as well. And then you have your regulatory risk. Let's say compliance stay informed with regulatory
1:41:11
changes and en ensure full compliance food safety labor laws data protection. So that kind of ends our GTM strategy.
Communicate Product Vision
1:41:19
So after this the GTM comes your communication. Communication has
1:41:25
different forms obviously internal communication wherein you hold a kickoff meeting internally right to introduce
1:41:32
and discuss the product vision with people right you give regular updates about it and then you conduct monthly
1:41:38
workshops to del deeper into specific aspects let's say with marketing
1:41:44
or let's say with USP with pricing right because what you have initially done is you put in your thoughts and now you
1:41:50
need to kind of get everybody on board with right Then obviously there's an external communication. So a press
1:41:56
release if needed, right? A blog post and obviously you share social media
1:42:01
where you share key highlights of the vision of the product to build anticipation. These are all nothing but
1:42:08
ways to create hype about your product. Right? Stakeholder management is investor meetings and partner
1:42:13
collaboration. Right? If you have your hotel partners or any partners in the chain in the supply chain, you need to
1:42:19
regularly communicate with them and obviously finalize your continuous feedback, customer surveys and internal
1:42:25
feedback. So this is a pretty simple one that obviously once we have created the product vision, we need to ensure that
1:42:31
it is communicated and understood by everybody and everybody is on the same page as we are. Now we have two topics,
Strategic Planning
1:42:40
right? Uh one is strategic planning and the second is business model. So we did
1:42:45
product vision, we did uh GTM strategy, right? And two topics strategy planning
1:42:51
which is very similar to let's say an overall planning and a business model. Why do you think as product managers it
1:42:57
all of this is required? Why why is it there in the curriculum? Why do product managers need to know all this? As
1:43:03
product managers, we are responsible for the product success, right? A product success is not just building a product
1:43:10
and saying, "Okay, I've I've built it out." There's the sales cycle, there's a marketing angle, there's a pricing
1:43:16
angle, there's a PR angle, right? All of these things indirectly and directly
1:43:22
impact your product, right? There's a strategic angle of what should be the positioning, what is the customer
1:43:27
competitor doing, right? What market space, what is the macroeconomics of this market? All of these things have a
1:43:34
direct impact on the product success. And for this sole reason you need to be
1:43:40
an expert on on strategy on business models on go to market strategy so that
1:43:46
you whenever you hear and talk to people about these things you can take some key
1:43:51
takeaways from that conversation and implement in your product so so as to definitely ensure product success.
1:43:58
Right? So this is not because just for the sake of it right it has a direct and
1:44:04
very important implications on your on the products that you would build. All right. Uh so strategic planning right
1:44:10
this is the process which an organization defines it strategy direction and decision making on
1:44:15
allocating resources to pursue the strategy right involves setting goals determining actions mobilizing
1:44:21
resources. So this is more of a long-term planning right unlike a go-to
1:44:26
market strategy which is let's say solving a immediate need strategic planning comes from ties up with your
1:44:32
product vision strategy wherein you think on a long term what is the strategy right that you now we will do
1:44:38
this next we will do this 5 years later we'll do this right so you need to have your strategy in place obviously so that
1:44:45
you can define and allocate budget and resources right correctly second for a
1:44:50
lot of startups It is required so that they can show it to their investors, get the required amount of funding, right? And third is so that the internal team
1:44:58
kind of understands where are we going, what will eventually happen with this product, right? What is the team
1:45:05
thinking? That is the some major points of why strategic planning kind of is
1:45:10
required. So again, you have your vision statement, mission statement, right? You have your core values, SWAT analysis,
1:45:16
strategic goals, right? This one is important, right? long-term broad goals derived from the vision. So example here
1:45:23
is given increase market share in the online booking industry by 20% over the next 5 years right objectives expand
1:45:31
into three new international markets by end of year two it's specific measurable steps and then you have your action
1:45:37
plans launch your marketing campaign right in Q1 let's say do a PR release in
1:45:42
Q2 something of that sort obviously your KPIs and metrics and final which is the
1:45:48
end goal is the resource allocation right how much money how many people right what timelines are we looking at
1:45:54
to building this product that is the end goal of this strategic planning document
1:46:00
or plan that is getting created right now what I'll do is I'll just club this
1:46:05
I will skip this example for now and I'll go directly to a business model because both of them are kind of tied up
1:46:11
together right so the key components of a business model are again value prop
Business Model
1:46:16
right what is the unique value that a c company offers to its customer right what are different groups of people that
1:46:23
is your customer segments. What are the channels? Right? So the means by which a company delivers its value proposition
1:46:29
to segments. So marketing channels, sales channels, distribution channels, all of this. Then what are the types of
1:46:35
relationship? Do we have 24/7 customer support? Do we have personalized relationships? What are the different
1:46:41
revenue streams? Right? So booking fees, commissions, premium membership, subscriptions, these are your different
1:46:47
types of revenue streams. Licensing and advertising are also there. Then you have your key resources. List the most
1:46:54
important assets to make the model work. So let's say if it's ops heavy then your supply chain becomes your key resource.
1:46:59
Let's say if it's a tech first company then obviously your AI your proprietary technology becomes key. If it's
1:47:05
partnership related like let's say in this example then hotel partnerships are your key resources right? What are the
1:47:11
key activities? Highlight the most important actions a company must take to operate successfully. So obviously
1:47:17
platform development marketing sales customer support building the supply hiring let's say delivery managers for
1:47:23
delivery boys for the food delivery app right those are key activities key partnerships again we know this right
1:47:29
network of suppliers and partners that help the business operate partnerships can reduce risk acquire resources allow
1:47:34
the business to focus on core activities so most of the easiest example is integrations so payment gateway
1:47:40
integrations these are your key partner without that you how will you function right you and build your own payment
1:47:46
gateway. Then obviously is the cost structure. What are the major costs? What are the fixed costs? What are the variable costs? Right? What are your
1:47:53
unit economics? All of these are components of a business model. Types of business model, product based models
1:48:00
where you're selling physical or digital products, retail stores, e-commerce platform, service based where you're selling a service, right? Let's say SAS
1:48:07
products, something like a salesforce or consulting firms, Mckenzie, BCG, they're selling their service platform based,
1:48:13
right? These are your marketplaces essentially eBay, Urban Company, Amazon.
1:48:18
Then you have your premium models. Spotify, YouTube is also a premium model, right? Where you can use it free
1:48:24
and then you can obviously subscribe for the YouTube premium one. Subscription models again are a pricing strategy. And
1:48:30
then you have your advertising models like let's say Google. Google does not take money from you but it shows you ads, right? So these are your
1:48:36
advertising models. Importance is clarity, focus, strategic planning, agent making the strategic decisions,
1:48:43
outlining the key activities and resources. And then you have a competitive advantage. You have financial viability, right? How much is
1:48:50
going in, how much will come out, per unit cost, how much, what are my fixed cost, when will I break even, right?
1:48:57
When will I start making profit? All of these. And then obviously adaptivity is it allows business to pivot and adapt
1:49:02
their strategies based on changes and new opportunities in the market, right? So the whole uh point here is if there's
1:49:10
one key takeaway from the strategic planning slide that we saw right it kind
1:49:17
of gives you an very long-term vision right broken down along with it into
1:49:22
smaller actionable items right and my key takeaway from a strategic plan has
1:49:29
always been what is that one key metric that I need to follow I think we discussed the northstar metric yesterday
1:49:36
if I'm not wrong. Right? I always trying to find that northstar metric from the
1:49:42
strategic plan. Right? The business model then tells me obviously how to what is expected out of my product.
1:49:49
Right? Should it be a premium model? Should I show ad? How do I take money? Where do I convert the customers? Should
1:49:55
I take data up front? Should I take data later? Right? Basis that business model is something that I change the UI UX of
1:50:03
my product as well. Right? Okay. So, understanding product feature
Understanding Product Feature Prioritization
1:50:09
prioritization. All right. I think uh this is one of the most key things that we probably learn in this entire course.
1:50:16
And as a product manager also, this is one of the most important things that we need to do. All right? Uh because
1:50:22
whenever you're building a product, there are hundreds of features and items and things that you can do in a product,
1:50:29
right? uh but given the resources of time of money of development of people
1:50:36
all of these right it is logically not possible that you can incorporate everything right uh because if you start
1:50:43
doing that then this product development will be essentially a never- ending story right so how do you decide what
1:50:51
goes in and what stays out right if you look at any product or project it is
1:50:57
always developed in phases Right? Phase 1 2 3 4 5. So in phase one, there's a
1:51:04
set of things that you do. In phase two, there's another set of things that you do. In phase three, there's another set of things that you do. How do you decide
1:51:10
what goes in phase one, what goes in phase two, what goes in phase three, right? Most of it is using a lot of
1:51:17
common sense and logical thinking. You can derive those those things, right?
1:51:23
There are certain frameworks and models that have been built over the years as
1:51:28
well, right? To kind of decide what is your phase one items, what is your phase
1:51:34
two items? You can call it phase one, you can call it priority one, right? Uh so essentially in order of priority, how
1:51:40
do you decide in the list of hundreds of things that you need to do? Uh what is the priority? Cool. So that is
1:51:46
essentially what we will be covering. All right. So feature prioritization is as I explained it's a very critical
1:51:52
aspect of product management right uh it helps you decide which features to develop first which features to develop
1:51:58
later right and this is primarily based on a couple of things potential impact and alignment with business goals right
1:52:06
uh customer experience comes in the number of users kind of impacted with a
1:52:12
particular feature so the multiple frameworks around this so you have your
1:52:18
First framework which is the simplest framework right is called MOSCO. So the
1:52:24
MOSCO method is is a very simple one which says must have, should have, could have, won't have, right? So your must
1:52:30
haves are features that are essential for the product to work. Without them the product cannot function. All right?
1:52:37
Should have is important features but not critical. Right? They should be
1:52:42
included but let's say they can be dup prioritized if necessary. If you think
1:52:47
that you know that you won't hit the the relevant timelines if we include these features then you have your could have
1:52:54
features that are nice but not necessary. They can be considered if time and resources allow and then you
1:53:00
have your won't have features that are not relevant for the current iteration but might be considered for in the
1:53:06
future. So let's take a simple example right um let's say you want to build a
1:53:13
food delivery app right only let's only take the customer side of things right so food delivery app what are let's list
1:53:21
down a few features first let's say the customer app right let's list down
1:53:28
certain features that should be part of a food delivery app so let me start
1:53:33
writing a login with uh mobile number. Second would be let's say capturing
1:53:40
name and address location capturing okay payment functionality
1:53:48
listing of restaurants okay offers and coupons types of foods okay so basically
1:53:56
filters menu of restaurants okay ratings and reviews tracking of delivery okay
1:54:05
message call to Restaurant support. Okay.
1:54:10
Schedule order. Okay. So I can Okay. Schedule when I want the orders to be delivered. Okay. Previous history of
1:54:18
orders. Okay. Push notifications. Subscriptions. Okay. Multi- language
1:54:23
support. Advertising. Okay. Options for contactless delivery. Recommendation of
1:54:29
food. Recommendation. Logic. Chatbot. Could be anything. pick up food from
1:54:36
restaurant function. Okay, I think this is good enough. Copy
1:54:41
all of this in an Excel sheet and against that each of these line items
1:54:46
can you keep writing if do you think if it's a must have, should have, could have or won't have for now, right? And
1:54:52
just the the the context is that we are building this food delivery app from
1:54:58
scratch. Right? This will be our first version. So based just this context
1:55:03
right we are just launching this what what is a must have what is a should have what is a could have what is a
1:55:09
won't have see there is no right wrong here all right uh this is this was an
1:55:14
exercise just to show you how chaotic prioritization can get right uh and
1:55:20
ultimately what is right for you and what is right for me might not be the same but one key thing a couple of key
1:55:28
things is we saw this list right and uh with that very minute context that I had
1:55:35
given you we jumped into defining the priority must have should have could
1:55:41
have all of that bit correct that is we directly started if if that if if this
1:55:46
were my these were definitely things I would do this is let's say some people came from a personal experience
1:55:53
perspective as well that these are certain issues that I kind of face so you know this needs to be solved so
1:55:59
hence I I think we should make this a M right. Yes. If you go back to the
1:56:06
previous lessons that we had kind of uh kind of learned right about product strategy vision and if you start from
1:56:13
there right and then you come here then your prioritization will be much more
1:56:19
robust and it'll have a lot more logical backing to it. So for example, what is
1:56:26
the point of building another food delivery app? Why are we building it? What is the product vision for this? Did
1:56:33
we think of what are the competitors out there in the market? What are they they offering right now? What are the key
1:56:39
gaps? What are the issues? How do I differentiate my product? Right? Once
1:56:45
you start start with that logical thought process and then you kind of say
1:56:51
okay you know what let's say in the market there are abundant food delivery apps which have tied up with lacks of
1:56:58
restaurants but I find this gap in the market where if I want quick food or food under 15 minutes I do not see a lot
1:57:05
of options. The point is before assigning priorities to your features list you need to go back to your
1:57:12
strategy and see what where it comes to right what is your product vision what is your strategy what is the
1:57:18
differentiator why are we building this product what will it solve who are we building it for who is my target
1:57:24
audience what are their issues and problems in life and aspirations right so please do not take each of these
1:57:31
topics in silos right because all of this is connected that is why you know
1:57:36
when I while you're starting off this this topic or before just speaking about it in product management your logical
1:57:43
thinking your your PM mindset is is the most valuable thing right knowing tools
1:57:50
is probably less than 5% of the job right because you might let's say in analytics you might know Google
1:57:56
analytics but in some company that you're interviewing use mix panel does not matter nobody will judge you on that
1:58:02
what they will judge you on is your PM mindset skills is your logical thinking.
1:58:08
All right. So now that we've kind of discussed this, now can we do a much
1:58:13
better prioritization? And when and you think of it right from the start, do a top-down approach that this is my
1:58:19
vision, this is the problem, these are the competitors, these are the features that they offer probably these are the
1:58:25
features that I would want to differentiate with. And then you can add certain features here. Mark them as must
1:58:32
have because those are your differentiators with certain basic features. Let's say login, location capturing, payment function. These are
1:58:38
very obviously must haves, right? And then you decide the priorities of the other ones. All right, let's move
1:58:45
forward. So these are certain examples that they have given, right? So Moscow is used in agile and scrum involvements
1:58:52
to scope work for sprint. So this is for an e-commerce mobile app probably user registration and login. This is a
1:58:57
definitely a must have. They said product search the ability users to search for products is a core
1:59:03
functionality and I think a lot of people said that you know search is a mustave. It's definitely in a higher
1:59:10
priority but it again all depends on let's say one basic question is how many
1:59:16
products are there on your website. If you just have let's say 10 15 20 products then building a search
1:59:23
functionality does not make sense at all. Right? because it's just like one scroll on the
1:59:29
page and you can list all your products. If your number of products let's say goes more than 5000
1:59:37
then definitely a search is is much required. But if it's a smaller number
1:59:44
and you can just list it in a single page easily then definitely a search is not a must have right. So each of these
1:59:50
features you have to think very deeply about right and just not at a very high
1:59:57
level that okay search huh every app has search so we should have you know we should definitely have search doesn't
2:00:03
work that way should have examples are product reviews and ratings right it adds value to helps users to make
2:00:10
informed decisions right but it's not critical for the app to function wish list again is a people are able to save
2:00:17
products for later but the app can again function option without could have is social sharing multiple payment options
2:00:24
right so you initially have your basic set of credit card debit card UPI but let's say Apple pay or others BNPL
2:00:32
payments are something that can come in much later and then won't have is
2:00:37
augmented reality product visualization right while very innovative it is not necessary at all it can be considered
2:00:44
for a much future development then in again in your prioritization framework.
2:00:50
This is the most popular framework that I have seen in the industry called rice. Rice rice stands for reach, impact,
2:00:58
confidence and effort. It is a datadriven framework designed to objectively prioritize features based on
2:01:05
scoring models. So reach is how many users or customers will the feature impact, right? Measured by the number of
2:01:11
users, transaction sessions affected. Impact is how much impact will this
2:01:17
feature have on the user experience or goal. So impact is typically typically rated on a scale right let's say 0 to
2:01:24
three scale 0.25 for minimal impact three for massive impact. So and your
2:01:30
impact can also be it has to be decided as a product team as a company what is the impact that you're going for some
2:01:38
teams will have let's say sales as an impact some teams will have let's say
2:01:43
customer rating as an impact right so what is the the northstar metric that
2:01:49
your product team or let's say your company as a whole is following that will define the impact here right let's
2:01:57
say if the company's vision is right now that we don't care about let's say customer rating. We just want to increase sales. Then a feature which
2:02:04
does not increase scale or increase sales too much but has a very high impact on customer rating ideally will
2:02:13
have a lower impact. Right? Because the business goal is not customer rating but
2:02:18
sales, right? Then you have your confidence level which is how confident are you in the accuracy of your reach
2:02:24
and impact estimates. So these estimates that you've carved out of reach of
2:02:30
impact how confident is it are you that you know this will happen this is a
2:02:35
percentage value 80% 90% 70% confident right and this confidence level again
2:02:42
sort of comes back to how did you decide your reach and your impact let's say if
2:02:49
this was absolutely an objective datadriven insight then
2:02:54
then you're confident confidence is much higher. But if your reach and impact is let's say more subjective than objective
2:03:01
then your confidence level should be a little lower. And the final is your effort. How much work is required to
2:03:08
implement the feature which is measured in person hours, days, weeks. This is essentially your most companies use the
2:03:15
engineering effort required to develop that functionality. Right? So the formula for the rice score is reach into
2:03:21
impact into confidence divided by effort. So here's a use case, right? So
2:03:27
all right. Uh so this is the formula for the rice core. So so let's say these
2:03:32
three features. So we prioritization prizing features for a task management app. Right. Uh the three features under
2:03:39
consideration are task reminder, project templates and advanced reporting. So these are the three features. They have
2:03:45
figured out the reach for each of these features. They have figured out the impact of these features. They put in a
2:03:51
confidence score. And they asked their engineering team to put in the efforts and then they calculated a rice score.
2:03:59
Right? Higher the rice score the better the more it will be more prioritized.
2:04:04
Right? So task reminders with the highest rice score would be prioritized over others. It's simple as that. In
2:04:11
your rice score it just boils down to the score. The higher the score the higher in priority this particular
2:04:17
feature goes. This is this is the formula. So reach into impact into confidence divided by effort. So reach
2:04:23
is here is 800 into 3 into 0.9 divided by 2. Okay. So yeah this is what is
2:04:32
rice. And the next one is uh this is the last product featurization or
2:04:38
prioritization prioritization model cano and one more which is value versus complexity. Uh this is also very similar
2:04:45
to our Moscow model. Right? If you look at this, it says basic needs, performance needs, excitement needs,
2:04:52
indifferent features, and reverse features, right? Uh I've always kind of aligned caro model in my head with uh
2:05:00
the HR model of hierarchy of needs for a human. I don't know guys if you guys
2:05:05
have seen that where you have your basic needs initially, then you have some more and then you have your at the top is uh
2:05:12
what is called actualization, right? So where it falls right? So basic needs all
2:05:19
of us again understand expect and in their absence will lead to dissatisfaction security stability. So
2:05:25
again most of your basic ones login with mobile number OTP able to enter my
2:05:31
address right add to cart pay online basic functionality right performance is
2:05:38
system should not lag it should not get hanged right the per so system performance should be decent enough
2:05:44
right more of these features you provide the more satisfied your customer faster loading times better performance
2:05:50
exciting need excitement needs delighters features that your users don't expect but love when they are
2:05:56
present. So innovative or surprising features, right? Uh let's say tomorrow
2:06:02
all of a sudden Zumato starts giving you a discount on every fifth offer on every
2:06:07
fifth order, right? That will be a delight for all of us, right? Then you have reverse features, features that can
2:06:13
actually lead to dissatisfaction if present. Let's say too many notifications, too many banner popups,
2:06:19
right? One my pet peeve is on a lot of apps when lot of websites when I go you I at
2:06:26
least get two or three pop-ups first. one is that GDPR then I have some coupon getting thrown in my face then I have
2:06:32
sign up popup getting thrown in my face that is leading to more dissatisfaction
2:06:37
than than happiness right so it's a reverse feature so all of these GDPR
2:06:42
notification on all these websites I will definitely put them under reverse feature sets so let's say this is a use
2:06:50
case where they are doing it for a streaming video platform so they have a basic video playback right with the
2:06:57
category is the must be the basic need right essential feature without it the
2:07:02
app is unusable then they have HD streaming which is obviously performance related so the more you provide the
2:07:08
happier the users are because the better the quality of that video will be
2:07:14
download for offline viewing right that is an exciting feature unexpected but highly appreciated then you have custom
2:07:20
themes for UI user don't care whether the feature is present or not right and
2:07:26
autoplay next video this the reverse feature. Some user dislike it on auto play. It can lead to dissatis
2:07:32
dissatisfaction. Autoplaying next video can be an issue, right? On a lot of apps, especially if it's a song app,
2:07:38
then autoplaying the next song is is more of a delight feature. And then you have your value versus complexity
2:07:45
metric. Essentially, your impact effort matrix. Again, these are features which
2:07:51
essentially you plot on a graph, right? one axis you have your impact on one axis you have your effort and then you
2:07:58
can chart where your feature lies. So this framework plot feature on a matrix that compares the potential business or
2:08:03
user value against the complexity or the effort required. This matrix divides feature into four quadrants. Quick wins
2:08:09
which is high value low effort. This should be prioritized first. Your big bets which is high value high effort.
2:08:15
These are important but require significant investment. Lowhanging fruit is your low value low effort. These can
2:08:21
be added if time permits. And then you have your money pits which is low value high effort. This should be typically
2:08:26
avoided. So if I just draw an axis impact versus effort and these are my
2:08:33
four quadrants right uh I'll just show you and this this graph value or
2:08:38
complexity let me just Google it. should probably be there, right? So, this is your business value,
2:08:44
right? This is your efforts. Low effort, low business value, right? High business
2:08:50
value, low effort definitely should do, right? High value and high effort. These
2:08:56
are your essentially big bets, strategic initiatives that we spoke about. And then high effort, low value is something
2:09:02
that we should completely avoid. Right? So, this is your value complexity matrix. This is also something that used
2:09:10
in in the early stages of uh product development or let's say at a strategic
2:09:16
level more so wherein uh you do not want to go too much into an objective
2:09:22
calculation right but you have some data you know where your business is headed what features will add certain value
2:09:29
right and you want to have a much higher level of discussions uh with let's say higher ups so this is something that is
2:09:36
most used there wherein you show them that you know let's say you have a discussion with your CPO BP or CEO right
2:09:44
getting into rice will be too too much of nitty-g gritties this sort of simplifies things at a at let's say a
2:09:51
CXO level where you say these features have high business values you have your justifications and your calculations
2:09:57
with it right and you obviously have your implementation or your effort along with it and then you say that this is
2:10:03
what we'll focus on right now this is that something that we will work towards in the next phases because these are our
2:10:09
strategic bets. This is something that we have kept it on the back burner but we can pick up whenever we have some
2:10:16
time and some resources free. This is something that we'll completely avoid.
2:10:21
Okay. So we did product feature prioritization right? Uh this is a much
Types of Product Features
2:10:28
more basic concept of the types of product features. All right. Uh what are
2:10:34
the types of features? We'll just quickly go through this and uh after this we'll jump again into a case study
2:10:40
of a feature prioritization because I want to really spend a lot of time on ensuring that we all understand how to
2:10:48
prioritize features much more better because that will be one of the biggest sort of questions you'll be asked when
2:10:55
whenever you are interviewing for any product role right a lot of your conversation will be and the judgment
2:11:02
also will be around what is your thinking around how do you prioritize certain features how do you work around
2:11:07
them and all of that. types of product features. One is core features. Then there are secondary features. We have
2:11:14
differentiating features, UI, UX features, technical and backend features and innovative features. Right? I think
2:11:21
the the names itself are kind of self explanatory of for most of them. Right?
2:11:26
I'll just get into each one of them. So core features are essentially functionalities without which product
2:11:32
wouldn't serve it purpose. Right? So these are the must-h have features that we already saw, right? that fulfill the
2:11:38
basic promise to the users. Example, ability to send and receive messages in a messaging app. Placing an order in a
2:11:44
food delivery app, right? Then you have your secondary features. These are your should have features, right? Features
2:11:51
that complement the core functionality but are not critical for the product's fundamental use. They improve user
2:11:57
experience offer additional convention. So, emoji reactions, right, in a messaging app, scheduling delivery times
2:12:04
in a food delivery app. Then you have your differentiating fe features which set the product apart from your
2:12:09
competitors. These can create a USP or a unique selling proposition and often
2:12:15
become the reason why users choose one product over others. So Instagram's stories features allow users to share
2:12:21
disappearing content. Spotify's personalized playlist like discover weekly based on user listening habits.
2:12:28
Right? Spotify, if you guys know, is the music app and their entire
2:12:34
recommendation and personalized playlist is the core reason why people, most people use Spotify over other music
2:12:41
apps, right? Though, personally, I'm more of a YouTube guy because I just like to listen to the repeats more than
2:12:48
the new ones. Then you have your UX UI features. These features focus on the user interface and experience. While
2:12:54
they may not add a new functionality, they improve how users interact with the product making making it more intuitive
2:13:00
and visually appealing. Right? So let's say drag and drop functionality is a design tool. Dark mode in a mobile app
2:13:06
that reduces ice strain. These these features essentially improve the UX or the user experience while using the app
2:13:12
or this website or any software or let's say any product per se. Then you have a technical and back end. These are hidden
2:13:17
from the user, right? but are crucial for the product's performance, security, safety, reliability, all that. So,
2:13:24
encryption to ensure data privacy, load balancing algorithm that improves the app speed and scalability ensures that
2:13:31
the app doesn't crash when you know a lot of users come in. All these technical features are also very
2:13:37
important. Then you have your innovative cutting edge functionalities, right? That push the boundaries of what the
2:13:43
product can do offering solving problems in ways that were previously unavailable. So AI powered image
2:13:48
recognition in Google photos, augmented reality shopping in IKEA's app, right? If you go on lens card, then the try on
2:13:56
feature wherein you put in your face and you can see the different how the different glasses look on you or let's
2:14:03
say a couple of these makeup apps have how the lipstick looks on your face, right? These are your innovative
2:14:09
features per se. Okay? So understanding features through value. These are customer focused features. These
Understanding Features Through Value
2:14:15
features directly address the needs, problems or desire of the user. Right? The value they offer is clearly and
2:14:21
directly linked to improving the user's life or making it easier. So a one-click checkout feature in e-commerce reduces
2:14:27
the friction in purchasing. Business focused features. You have features that align with the product's business goals
2:14:33
that is increasing revenue, customer retention or brand differentiation. So let's say your subscription reminder
2:14:39
feature or if you see which is a dark feature. So there are certain something
2:14:45
called dark UX. All right. So what is dark UX is uh a functionality which is
2:14:51
not really in the benefit of the customer but it is there mostly to solve
2:14:57
a business problem. So let's say if when you're buying insurance online a lot of times you see certain add-ons already
2:15:05
tick marked right. Let's say if when you're buying a motor insurance, you will see a personal liability insurance
2:15:11
already checked and added to your list, right? Idally that is dark UX. They are
2:15:17
not asking you if you want it. They're already adding it in your bucket hoping that 99% people think that this is
2:15:24
mandatory or this is not optional or something of that sort. Don't uncheck that box and buy it. So it solves a
2:15:32
business goal problem of increasing revenue, increasing profitability, all of that, right? So certain features are
2:15:39
these kind of features that is a business focused feature if you can call it that way. Right? Identifying
Identifying Valuable Features
2:15:45
identifying these valuable features. So you have your user research, competitor analysis, datadriven decisions or
2:15:52
understanding pain points, desires through surveys, interviews, right? Usability tests help uncover which
2:15:58
features would provide the most value. By studying what feature competitors offers, you can identify where your
2:16:04
product can innovate or differentiate itself or even catch up to your competition. And then there are
2:16:09
datadriven decisions where feature usage metrics, abandonment rate, abandonment rates and user feedback provide critical
2:16:16
insights into which features are most valuable and where improvements can be made. So you look at a lot of your data,
2:16:23
your conversion rates, your let's say finanis that okay from step one to step
2:16:28
two there's a dropout of 50% from step two to step three there's again a dropout of 70%. Right? And then you
2:16:34
start delving in deeper as to why this is happening. You look at different user cohorts you look at different times of
2:16:41
the day different regions based on different themes. You start looking at this cuts and pieces. You look at this
2:16:47
data right and see if there's a problem. So probably you can just see that if more than 1,000 users come on a
2:16:54
particular day right your drop offs increase right that is primarily because your system is not scalable enough so
2:17:01
then you go and solve that problem right if you see that this age range of let's
2:17:06
say 35 to 45 I'm seeing more drop off in this user demography right so you can go
2:17:12
and talk to this this age group this set right do your user surveys and identify
2:17:17
why that is happening and then go and solve for it, right? Uh let's say if you're on the page, your main call to
2:17:25
action or their intended use is to add to cut, right? But you see that a lot of
2:17:31
people are just moving their mouse around and uh you know, not doing add to
2:17:36
cut because probably your add to cut is not on the right side where it usually is, but you've put your add to cut
2:17:42
somewhere here, right? So this is people are not just going here. You can see there the movement of the cursor going
2:17:49
from this this this like this but nobody is going here. So you can definitely do
2:17:55
a hypothesis wherein you change the position of your add toart button from here to here and see if that increases
2:18:00
your add toart rate. Feature prioritization we already kind of studied right not all features can or
2:18:06
should be developed at once. Prioritizing features is crucial. So it is essentially done on customer value,
2:18:12
business impact, feasibility, right? Right? So, how much does the feature help users? Does the feature align with
2:18:18
the company's goals such as revenue, engagement or any other metric that can
2:18:23
is the focus of the business or let's say the group or the product group that
2:18:29
you're part of, right? And feasibility is the feature realistically to be built with the current resources, timelines,
2:18:35
same technology, right? A feature that offers high value but is too complex or expensive should be ideally dep
2:18:42
prioritized. And then is your final feature life cycle where we've already studied this ideation, design,
2:18:50
development, launch and optimization. Clear? Okay. Now this is feature
Feature Documentation
2:18:56
documentation. All right. This is talked about a lot in product of how you are
2:19:01
documenting your features, your user stories, your specifications. Right. Uh
2:19:07
it is very important to kind of document things in a much better and clear way so
2:19:15
that people who are actually developing it, designing it have a very clear idea
2:19:21
of what they need to do and why they need to do and what needs to happen once they have done this. Right? Because you
2:19:27
have done your ideation, you understand what needs to be built. Everything from start to end is clear in your head
2:19:33
because you are the guy, right? You're the product person. It is your baby. You have conceptualized. Oh, this is the
2:19:39
feature I'll build. This is what will happen. This is what needs to happen. Right from start to end, it's all in
2:19:44
your head. But you alone can obviously never bring it to life. So you need your
2:19:50
other team members to bring it to actual life because as a product manager, you do not design, you do not code, you do
2:19:55
not market, you do nothing, right? You are essentially paid to think. Correct?
2:20:01
So your way of communicating your entire thought process is the feature
2:20:07
documentation right it can be in the form of user stories technical specifications wireframes right so that
2:20:14
everybody else has as clear an understanding as you have so for user
2:20:20
stories in the industry you will most probably see uh Jira being used right uh
2:20:26
in Jira you can write your user stories right which will then be assigned into a developer who will work on it, create
2:20:33
tasks, all of that bit. Uh let me see if I can find a nice example of a Jira
2:20:38
story and how to do this. How to write
2:20:44
user stories in Jira. Yeah. So this is what essentially a Jira board looks
2:20:51
like, right? Once you get access, you there's a create issue button somewhere here behind this user story headline.
2:20:59
You click on that. This pop-up will open up. You will choose your project. Your issue type is story. All this will
2:21:05
essentially be created by your project management team or your scrum team. Right? And then these are your different
2:21:11
components. You have a summary. You have descriptions. You can attach your different files for it. Right? The way
2:21:18
that a story is usually written is documented here. Right? As a persona, I
2:21:23
want to do this so that XYZ happens. Right? So let's say if you are writing a
2:21:29
story or trying to explain a search functionality that you know you want to build a search functionality you on a
2:21:35
customer app you will write as a customer I want to be able to search for
2:21:40
food items so that I can go and order the the item that I want to that that I
2:21:47
want that I have searched for let's say right so as a personalized who are we building this for right we are not the
2:21:53
just job title we are after the person of the person Right? Wants to is describing their intent right not the
2:22:00
features they use. What are they actually trying to achieve and so that is the immediate desire to do something
2:22:06
that fits in the picture. What is the overall benefit that they are trying to achieve? So for example user story might
2:22:11
look like as Max I want to invite my friends so that we can enjoy the service together. As Sasha I want to organize my
2:22:18
work so I can feel more in control. As a manager I want to able to understand my colleagues progress so I can better
2:22:23
report our success and failures. This is the normal structure of a user story,
2:22:28
right? It's no rocket science. It's very simple. And then you start writing your
2:22:34
details of the each of these stories, right? Uh as in what are the details
2:22:39
now? So in search that I should be able to search with let's say restaurant names, you want to be able to search
2:22:45
with food item names, right? Or area names as well. Whatever different things
2:22:52
that you should be able to search as you start writing in the in the details, right? Uh then you can also have in the
2:22:59
details some wireframes that this is how it should probably look like. So you attach those wireframes in your story,
2:23:05
right? Uh then you have something at the end of the user story called an acceptance criteria. So acceptance
2:23:10
criteria essentially defines that once this feature is developed, what is the criteria by which you will decide if
2:23:16
this is an acceptable feature or not. Right? So it'll obviously have your basic features that you know I should be
2:23:22
able to enter the name and it gives me the correct relevant results right that is let's say one acceptance if I enter
2:23:28
biryani it should show me the biryani items right second acceptance criteria
2:23:33
can also be that if I start typing the first three words it should show me
2:23:38
certain recommendations so if I do bir it should show me some names biryani
2:23:43
hyderi biryani or something of that sort the third acceptance can be a performance related acceptance right
2:23:49
that the search result should not take more than 100 milliseconds. Right? So let's say these are my acceptance
2:23:55
criteria and then I submit it. So once this feature is developed when even the QA is testing they will look at this
2:24:01
acceptance criteria and see if it fits the acceptance criteria. Even when you are then testing it you also remember
2:24:08
okay this was the acceptance criteria that I gave and if it meets these acceptance criteria or not. Right? So
2:24:14
that is how user stories are essentially written. So look at the details. Company name is
2:24:21
XYZ logo size logo with positioning of the logo. Color of the logo is something that this person has added as a
2:24:27
description. Right. So this is this was an example for you know the what how to use Jira.
2:24:36
Okay. All right. So designing product features and specifications right. So capturing
Designing Product Features and Specifications
2:24:42
features and specification from the voice of customer VOC. VOC I think all of us must have heard in our
2:24:49
organizations at some point or the other right uh it essentially refers to
2:24:54
gathering insights feedbacks directly from the customer to understand their pain points their aspirations their
2:25:01
expectations all of this right and using these insights product managers can kind of
2:25:06
create features that resonates with the users that either solves their problems that they have spoken about or solves
2:25:13
some aspirations that they have kind of portrayed in in this voice of customer
2:25:18
period, right? So in in simple terms, you talk to the customer directly and
2:25:24
you kind of take their feedback. Now in in a lot of cases, talking to customers directly might not be possible, right?
2:25:30
So there's a good proxy for it is let's say your reviews, your play store reviews, your Google reviews, your uh
2:25:38
mouthshut.com reviews, anywhere where the customer has left a direct review,
2:25:43
right? You can just go through those reviews, scrape them, read through them and understand what is the customer
2:25:50
trying to say. Right? Apart from this obviously you can do talk to your customers, do surveys, focus groups to
2:25:57
also understand the voice of customers. So methods are customer interviews, surveys, focus groups, right? Customer
2:26:03
feedback in app or online. So collect user feedback directly within the app or through feedback forms on your website.
2:26:10
Social media listening. Monitor discussions on social platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Insta, all
2:26:16
of that bit, right? And your final is your customer support tickets. Analyze recurring issues and feedback received
2:26:21
by customer support teams. Customers often report problems or missing feature through these channels. So these are
2:26:27
your multiple ways of collecting the voice of customer. Then a lot of companies do a NPS survey as well,
2:26:35
right? to gdge customer satisfaction on a so the the biggest question is on a scale of 1 to 10 how likely are you to
2:26:41
recommend a product to a friend five four mostly I found such direct
2:26:46
questions very useless to be very honest right because it as a product manager does not give me anything if let's say
2:26:54
my NPS is 70 or 80 does not matter to me if it is 30 40 I know people are not
2:27:00
liking it but I still don't know why so NPS has in real life in practical
2:27:06
practicality has never really helped me as a product manager. Product reviews rating definitely Google play app store
2:27:12
we al we already spoke about and then you have your final user analytics which is your Google analytics m panel to
2:27:20
identify how customers interact with existing features and their pain points.
2:27:25
Okay. So once VC is collected uh the product manager needs to analyze it to
2:27:31
extract valuable insights about the customer and translate them into actionable product features and
2:27:36
specifications which is what our essentially job is. So how do we do that is one you identify patterns and trends
2:27:42
or grouping of similar feedbacks right uh to identify common pain points feature requests or area improvement. So
2:27:49
this is a good example. 50% of users mention difficulty finding products using the current search function. So
2:27:56
this is a clear indicator that there is something wrong with the search function because 50% of user said that they
2:28:02
cannot find the right product. So now then you'd start delving deeper into the search function as to what is happening.
2:28:08
What are the users trying to do? What are the results that they see? Were they essentially intending to look for and
2:28:15
what they were they shown? And basis this you then figure out the problem and propose a solution to it as well.
2:28:22
Categorization of feedback is usability issues, feature requests or it is a bug.
2:28:27
So you can organize it into different baskets that let's say these are bugs in
2:28:32
our existing system. These are let's say performance issues because a lot of your customer feedback will say the app is
2:28:39
slow, the website does not load, right? So all of these can be bucketed under
2:28:44
performance issues and then you have your standard feature requests which is
2:28:49
I want a feature which where I should be able to do this where I should be able to do that right so let's say if your
2:28:55
website does not have a wish list then you might hear a c some customer saying you know I wish there was something
2:29:01
where I could save all the items that I want to buy later so you know these are
2:29:06
feature requests around a wish list that are coming in right so categorize you
2:29:11
know, feedback. Then prioritize user problems. Not all customer requests are equal, right? Identify the most
2:29:18
impactful problems and then use prioritization frameworks to decide which features should be tackled first,
2:29:24
right? Example, a recurring pain point about poor onboarding can be prioritized over minor UI preferences. So again all
2:29:32
these features issues performance issues you will have to start prioritizing based on reach impact or you could do
2:29:40
Moscow right as simple as that and then start dealing with them from the first
2:29:47
priority onwards segment user feedback by persona different segments can have
2:29:52
different needs so you have your power users you have enterprise versus SMBs and their needs can vary so power users
2:30:00
request more advanc advanced reporting but new users want simplified onboarding
2:30:05
right this is a classic case in a B2B software company right where your
2:30:12
already established users now request more advanced features while the newer
2:30:18
ones are still dealing with the basics of onboarding starting up the system so how do you prioritize which one do you
2:30:25
look at first right that is something that we need to solve so we'll figure how to do all of
2:30:31
You have your survey data right to tools like Google form or survey monkey can
2:30:36
provide the insights from the responses and then we have qualitative analysis
2:30:41
interview and focus groups something we already understand after analyzing VC
2:30:47
product manager translate needs into actionable features. This process involves breaking down insights into
2:30:53
specific product functionalities. Right? So identify the core problem or need.
2:30:58
This is a very important step. Sometimes, not sometimes, majority of the times,
2:31:05
what you will see is people will come up to you or even in your feedbacks, you'll see people trying to kind of give
2:31:13
solutions, right? So, let's say most people will say, you know, I wish there was a button here that when I click on
2:31:21
this, XYZ happens. Now as a product manager you cannot take that on face
2:31:27
value because if you start doing that then there'll be like oh 1,000 feature list that you'll have to deal with right
2:31:33
because most people what they do they think that you know they understand the software they understand all of this
2:31:40
they understand the product as well and you know if once you follow their
2:31:45
solution it'll be the best right this is a evergreen problem in product So
2:31:53
instead of looking at what they are saying on face taking what they're saying on face value we need to go one
2:31:59
step behind that face right and identify the actual core problem of why is this
2:32:06
person saying whatever he's saying right what is the pain point or what is the
2:32:12
the end goal that they are trying to reach and then if you try and do that
2:32:17
you will see that at least 100 of your feature requests that let's Say these
2:32:22
different 100 people have spoken about stem from the same core problem that all of these people are facing but all of
2:32:29
them are kind of telling you that problem in multiple different ways. Let's say some are telling you in a
2:32:34
solution format, some are telling you in a end goal format, right? Because everybody kind of gives feedback also
2:32:40
very differently, right? Not everybody knows that you are a product manager and it is your job to to design the product
2:32:48
feature and think about the solutioning and all they need to tell you is the problem. Most people don't know this and
2:32:55
they will even if they know this they cannot do that because there's an inherent quality in all of us to if they
2:33:02
if if we see a problem right we'll try to solve it or at least give a
2:33:08
suggestion for the solution of it. Very few of us actually state the core
2:33:13
problem to anybody else. Right? And in my career, this is the biggest problem
2:33:19
as a as one of the biggest problems as a product manager that I keep facing even today. Right? Be it uh let's say
2:33:26
internal feedback from different team members, from CXOs that I keep getting,
2:33:31
be it my customer feedback that I keep looking at, there's no clarity in what the actual problem is. Nobody wants to
2:33:38
define it when in very simple clear terms. And I think this is one of the biggest reasons that product managers
2:33:44
are really required, right? Because if you look at a product management role, the product management role does not
2:33:51
code, does not market, does not sell, does not design, does not do anything.
2:33:58
Right? If you really ask me, they're only paid to think. So why does an a
2:34:04
company need a group of people just to think and just to analyze and it's not
2:34:10
like you we are data analysts that we are even good great at doing data analysis right our data analysis skills
2:34:17
are also let's say average as compared to an actual data analyst and I've often
2:34:22
thought about this issue in my career right like why does product management exist and it one of the thing that I
2:34:30
kind of always keep boiling down on is this problem that if I wasn't there then
2:34:35
let's say my business team would come and give a solution directly to my engineering team and they would directly
2:34:41
implement it and that would solve no problem in the world because that communication is completely broken they
2:34:48
are giving a solution they are not understanding the problem they are building that exact solution per se and
2:34:55
the customer is still suffering so this is what you are actually solving for in
2:35:00
your company that that is where they pay you to identify that actual problem behind the problems and behind the chaos
2:35:07
that is being created in the company. All right. So yeah, define the user
2:35:12
story. So we saw we need to write simple descriptions of the feature, right? From the user's perspective defining what
2:35:19
customers want to achieve with the product. So as a team leader, I want to receive notifications for upcoming task
2:35:25
deadlines so I don't miss them. Then you have create feature requirements. Then
2:35:31
based on the user stories, you define the specific features needed to solve
2:35:36
that identified problem and the requirements of the functionality. So notification is that the system will
2:35:42
automatically send a reminder notification to the task owner and assign two days before the task is due.
2:35:48
Users can set customized reminders for one day, two day, one week before due date. On the dashboard, task will be
2:35:54
sorted by due date with task due sooner highlighted at the top of the list.
2:36:00
So sort by the earliest task due. So these are some details of that feature
2:36:06
that you will also have to define which is detail specification further break it
2:36:11
down. So you can skip this. Yeah. Okay. We will just look at this this piece.
2:36:17
Just look at the below piece. The performance metrics and the acceptance criteria. So the accept performance
2:36:22
metrics is notification should delivery should occur within 1 second of the trigger time. Right? reminders must
2:36:29
reach 95% of the users without failure. So this is what you as a product manager are defining that this is the level of
2:36:36
performance I need right 1 second is also a very long time normally in
2:36:41
engineering in software engineering we talk in micro milliseconds right 100 milliseconds 200 milliseconds and
2:36:49
acceptance criteria as I I think we already spoke a little notifications are
2:36:54
successfully sent to all users for tasks due in two days users can customize the timing of notifications this these are
2:37:01
my accent criteria. If these functionalities are not there, then the story is not done. Then engineering team
2:37:08
still needs to work more on this story. Right? Once these exception criteria are
2:37:13
met, then we are good to make this feature live. That is what this acceptance criteria essentially means.
2:37:20
All right? You have your edge cases as well in when you're defining your specifications. So edge cases is
2:37:26
scenario. What happens if the user's email address is incorrect or invalid? Right? what happens if the task due date
2:37:32
is changed after a reminder has been already sent. So essentially what can go wrong you need to think about that and
2:37:38
incorporate that in your stories as well and obviously give a solution. So for the email address the solution given
2:37:44
here is show an error message in the notification settings if the system cannot send an email due to invalid
2:37:49
address. If the task due is changed after a reminder is already sent then the t system will cancel the original
2:37:55
reminder and send a new one based on the updated due date. Right? There can be much more more edge cases to this as
2:38:02
well. Right? If you sit and when we think of each feature, we will be able to figure out the different edge cases.
2:38:08
But we'll keep that for a later date. Dependency is the feature dependent on the existing notification service. It
2:38:15
requires integrating
2:38:20
features for customer. So now that we've kind of done with VC, right? uh we've
2:38:28
done all our research and understanding. We analyze product usage to evaluate how
2:38:34
well the features are meeting these customer needs. Right? So you we obviously track our KPIs metrics such as
2:38:41
multiple metrics. Some examples are user engagement, adoption rate, satisfaction scores, right? Uh customer support
2:38:48
feedback. So review support tickets and feedback to identify any recurring issues. And then it is again the
2:38:55
iteration process. iterate and improve based on feedback, identify areas for improvement and then you implement these
2:39:01
changes and then this continuous feedback loop kind of uh comes in right
2:39:08
uh where you launch something, you analyze it, you iterate, you again launch and then this loop keeps running,
2:39:16
right? That is how normally agile product management is kind of done.
Product Mix and Product Lines
2:39:21
Product mix. Yes, this is the second big item that we'll be covering. Product
2:39:27
mix. So product mix refers to the complete range of products that a company offers. It represent the total
2:39:33
variety of product that a business sells and can be classified in terms of width, length, depth and consistency. So this
2:39:39
is a classic example of a product mix for Marico, right? You have your product
2:39:44
categories which is your product with right? Hair oil, hair care, edible oil, deodorants, personal wash, fabric cream.
2:39:50
Then these are your product lines. Parachute, nihar, leon, safola, all of that. And within your parachute, you
2:39:57
have coconut oil, advanced, jasmine, therapy, stars, which is your product width and variance. So this is called a
2:40:04
product mix where there's width, there's a product line, there's depth as well. Okay, just some quick references. Width
2:40:11
refers to the number of different product lines a company offers. So Apple's product mix includes product
2:40:16
lines like iPhone, MacBook, iPad, variables. So this is the width different product lines or different
2:40:22
types of products right length refers to the number of products or items within a
2:40:27
company's product line. So within the iPhone line it has multiple phones SE 14
2:40:32
15 16 now right? So this is your length then your depth refers to the number of
2:40:39
variations for each product. So each iPhone model has different storage options, color variations, right? That
2:40:47
is the depth and consistency is how closely related the various product lines are in terms of production,
2:40:53
distribution and usage. So Apple's products are much more highly consistent because they all operate on the same
2:40:59
software and designed for the similar customer base. So consistency is pretty high, right? So these are the key
2:41:05
dimensions. So they've again given an example for Nike. Nike has multiple product lines.
2:41:11
Footwear, apparel, equipment. Within footwear product line, Nike has sneakers, running shoes, basketball
2:41:17
shoes. Depth is it offers various colors and sizes for each model. Right. And
2:41:23
Nike product are related to sports and active lifestyle maintaining some bit of consistency, let's say, across product
2:41:29
lines, but their manufacturing I think will be much different. But yes, the
2:41:34
distribution and the customer base will still be same for Nike, right? across
2:41:39
all these three product lines that they have kind of stated here. So what is a product line? A product line is refers
2:41:45
to a group of related products that are marketed under single brand and are designed to serve a specific segment or
2:41:52
meet a specific particular need. All products within a product line typically have similar functionality are marketed
2:41:58
to the same customer or share distribution channels. Okay, let's see some examples. I think that will clarify
2:42:05
this for us. So what are the key characters related products? Products in a line typically share similar features
2:42:11
or design for the same purpose. So Coca-Cola offers product line that are beverages include Coke, Diet Coke, Coke,
2:42:17
Zero flavored Cokes targeting the same customers, right? Microsoft Office has a
2:42:23
product line that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, all designed for business users and working people like us and
2:42:30
sold under a common brand name. So products within a product line are usually market with the same brand
2:42:36
identity. Here they have given the L'Oreal example. It has a skincare product line that includes all these
2:42:42
different things. All are sold under the L'Oreal Paris brand name. And if you
2:42:48
look at it, they're also targeted to the same customers. Right? Example, I think
2:42:54
we'll just keep this one now. Why are product mix and product lines important? Right? For business it is market
2:43:00
coverage, risk management and brand extension. Right? So a diver product mix
2:43:05
allows companies to target different segments, expand their presence by having multiple product lines. It
2:43:11
reduces the dependency on the success or failure of just one product, right? And obviously it helps you diversify your
2:43:18
risk as well. And brand extension is they can leverage their brand reputation across product lines to launch newer
2:43:24
products, right? So same case what we spoke about let's say Tata Motors they have these three different product lines
2:43:31
right all of them help them cover more of that automobile market right so there
2:43:38
increases their market coverage in one year if their passenger vehicles are not doing great let's say their commercial
2:43:43
vehicles might see an uptick so it reduces their risk of a bad result in a
2:43:50
particular year right and obviously they're using the same Tata brand across all of these
2:43:56
Product lines for customers, it is more choices and specializations because
2:44:01
product lines offer specialized products that cater to specific needs of preferences making it easier for customers to find the right product.
2:44:08
Okay. Example given is PNG includes beauty, healthcare, cleaning products.
2:44:13
Each product line tied laundry detention head and shoulders serve distinct needs
2:44:19
but collectively broaden the PNG's market reach. Okay. Product line extension refers to addition of new
2:44:26
products to an existing product line. Right? These new products are typically variations of existing ones but offer
2:44:32
different feature styles. Target segment. This is used to leverage the brand equity and customer loyalty.
2:44:38
Right? So types of product line extensions new variants new features targeting new segments. Examples
2:44:45
Coca-Cola extending the product line by offering Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Coke Cherry. Right? These vision target
2:44:51
customers who want low calorie options of different flavors while maintaining the core Coca-Cola identity. Right.
2:44:57
Apple iPhone line again extends the iPhone line with new models which differ
2:45:02
in terms of features, price points, performance level but cater to different customer needs within the same product
2:45:08
line right especially they bought an iPhone SE just for let's say the Indian market so that they can have a lower
2:45:14
priced model as well. Product modifications refer to changes or improvement made to existing products.
2:45:21
These modifications can be driven by advancement, customer feedback, market competition, right? It does mainly aim
2:45:29
to keep products relevant. So if you look at your Oreo, Oreo has these many versions. You have your strawberry Oreo,
2:45:35
mini Oreo, vanilla Oreo, all of that. These are just to in my head mostly just
2:45:41
to keep the product relevant, right? So types of product modifications are mentioned. Quality modifications improve
2:45:48
the product's durability, performance, right? So car manufacturing manufacturer upgrading the engine of an existing
2:45:54
model to improve its performance. Functional modifications are enhancing or adding new functionalities to the
2:46:00
product to improve its usefulness or convenience. So smartphone manufacturer adding a new camera or increasing
2:46:08
battery life in the next iteration of the existing phone model. So if I were to say iPhone follows functional
2:46:15
modifications for every new launch, right? They they also follow style and
2:46:20
aesthetics. So they change the appearance, design or packaging, right? Uh bigger screen, bezel-free screen, all
2:46:28
of these are style and aesthetic modifications for the iPhone, right? And then you have a feature upgrades, adding
2:46:34
new or advanced features. So Microsoft releasing updates for Window OS to include new security features. So I'll
2:46:41
just reiterate very quickly. Line extensions are new variants, new features, right? Modifications are of
2:46:48
these four types. Quality modifications, functional modifications, style or aesthetic and feature upgrades.
2:46:56
Benefits again market segmentation, brand loyalty, increase market share and
2:47:01
competitive advantage. So product modifications, improve satisfaction,
2:47:06
stay current, cost effective, compliance, safety. But if you really ask me, I think product modifications
2:47:11
are primarily done by most companies to stay current, right? Uh it is just to
2:47:18
stay in the news that these product modifications are being done. Product line extensions
2:47:24
I can understand or agree to a certain extent that increase market share or or
2:47:31
they try to give a competitive advantage, right? But uh it's I think
2:47:37
more gimmicks than anything else if you really ask me. So I think we've kind of covered enough
2:47:44
of product line extensions and modifications, right? Uh I will now directly jump to the BCG product matrix.
BCG Matrix
2:47:52
So the BCG matrix also known as the Boston Consulting Group matrix. It's a
2:47:57
strategic tool used in product portfolio management to evaluate the potential of a company's products or business units
2:48:04
based on market growth and market share. All right. Developed by the BCG
2:48:10
consulting company. This matrix helps companies allocate resources by identifying which products or business
2:48:16
units are worth investing in, which should be maintained and which need to be divested. Right? So you can do this
2:48:22
with your products. You can do this if you're let's say Reliance, you can do this with your multiple companies as
2:48:29
well, right? You can do this with your different business units within a company as well. So you can use this
2:48:36
framework in multiple ways, right? So these are your four essentially
2:48:41
quadrants. Star, cash cow, question mark and dog. So if you see this line, this
2:48:47
is the your this is the market growth line. So high market growth, high market share, this is the star product, right?
2:48:54
Because it's growing also fast, it is also dominant in that industry. If it is growing fast but it has low share, then
2:49:02
it is a question mark, right? Because we don't know where this will actually end up. Low growth but high share, this is a
2:49:08
cash cow, right? So the industry as such is not let's say not growing but that
2:49:13
industry we has completely monopolized in a sense, right? So that is my cash
2:49:18
cow and there's let's say low growth and low market share as well right. So this
2:49:24
could be this would be the dog and then basis this the company or the the group
2:49:30
company per se can now decide which product which company should I put in more investments put in more resources
2:49:38
all of that bit right so let's let's just take this example of uh Reliance
2:49:44
right basis this chart what do you think is Reliance cash cow so Reliance
2:49:49
Industries per say right what would be the star here so Jio and retail yes can
2:49:55
come in the star one because high growth and high market share as well for for both go and retail. What is question
2:50:01
mark here? Reliance jewels right and low growth low market share stars the media
2:50:07
outlet right cool. So this is the explanation of it. Stars is characteristics is high market share and
2:50:14
high growth. Right. uh strategy. Stars are using the leading products in a rapidly growing industry requiring
2:50:20
significant investment to sustain growth. Right? Companies should focus on investing in nurturing stars to
2:50:26
eventually become cash cow as the market growth slows down. Cash cow is high
2:50:32
market share in a low growth market. Cash cow generates stable and significant cash flow often with minimal
2:50:38
investments. In the market growth is low. Use the profit from cash flow to fund stars and invest in question marks.
2:50:45
Question mark or the problem children. Low market share and high growth market are often new products or business units
2:50:52
that requires substantial investment to increase their market share. Objective is evaluate whether it's worth investing
2:50:58
to grow these into stars or diverse if they lack potential. And dogs we also
2:51:04
all know market share in a low growth market. They have limited growth potential are not profitable. Right?
2:51:10
Companies typically aim to divest dogs or reposition them as they drain resources without providing any return.
2:51:17
Right? So how it helps is we resource allocation. Right? We already read about
2:51:23
this. Which one to give investment where to put more people, right? Strategic
2:51:28
planning. So provides insight for developing growth strategies, right? And then balancing the portfolio. ensure a
2:51:34
balanced mix of product types for both short-term profitability and long-term
2:51:40
growth. Okay, cool. So today's topic essentially is value
Value Creation, Communication, and Delivery
2:51:46
creation commun uh this is the agenda for it. Value creation, value communication
2:51:52
strategies, co-creation, value delivery, different types of model and a basic
2:51:58
understanding of Porter's value chain analysis. All right, working on it.
2:52:03
So value creation understanding customer needs right understanding customer needs about identifying what customers truly
2:52:11
require, desire or expect and then developing products or solution to fulfill those needs right so in product
2:52:17
terms uh we also call this uh team right so this is your discovery phase wherein
2:52:23
essentially we are trying to figure out what the product should be what does the customer truly want what are their
2:52:29
aspiration right and uh what sort of product features or product in itself
2:52:35
should be kind of created so that it brings some tangible benefits and value.
2:52:42
So understanding customer needs is identifying them, prioritizing needs
2:52:47
based on value, defining the value proposition, designing solutions and
2:52:52
continuous learning and iterations. All right. Uh
2:52:57
identifying customer needs. First step is value creation is identifying what customers actually want or need. This
2:53:06
can involve conducting market research, gathering customer feedback, analyzing pain points and observing customer
2:53:11
behavior. Techniques like survey, interviews, focus groups and empathy are often used to gain insights into
2:53:18
customer preferences and challenges and motivations. Right? So I will just take a very basic
2:53:25
example. Right? This is our survey. Right. And uh
2:53:34
the issues there were multiple issues, right? Uh customer support issues, operational
2:53:41
issues, practical lack of practical knowledge,
2:53:47
right? That's elite art training. All of these multiple issues
2:53:53
desires job placement higher income roles higher income right if I were to
2:54:01
actually identify what is the key
2:54:06
let's say key need or of the customer here which is you guys right I would
2:54:14
just as long as I can ensure and sort of give
2:54:21
build a product which provides every customer a an increment in their
2:54:27
earnings. I think my product is a success is
2:54:34
you a lot of you identified the let's say
2:54:39
training quality issues or operational challenges support issues as a big need
2:54:46
of the customer and try solving for that right uh those are those are I think I
2:54:53
would rate a much lower in priority from a customer perspective right so this is
2:54:59
identification of customer needs. Now this is prioritizing based needs based on value which I which is exactly what I
2:55:05
did. I know there are let's say four five needs. I prioritize the first one based on the value because I know this
2:55:12
will deliver the most value to my customers.
2:55:17
Right? So that this is what this statement says. Not all needs are equal. Some are must haves while others are
2:55:23
maybe nice to haves or potential differentiators. Product managers prioritize needs that deliver the most
2:55:29
value. Balancing customer desire with feasibility. Okay. Defining the value proposition. Right. Once the needs are
2:55:35
understood, product managers work to articulate a clear value proposition. This is a statement that describes how
2:55:41
the product or service solves a problem or improves the customer. Sorry, designing solutions around need. In this
2:55:48
step, product manager collaborate with design engineering other teams to create solutions tailored to these identified
2:55:55
needs. Right? This might involve developing new features, improving exist or reimagining the entire project
2:56:03
product. Prototyping and usability testing are often used to validate that the solution addresses customer needs
2:56:10
effectively before a full scale launch. And then there is your continuous
2:56:16
learning and iterations. Customer needs evolve. So it is essent essential to maintain an ongoing feedback loop to
2:56:24
adapt the product as new needs emerge or priorities shift right agile methodology
2:56:29
supports this iterative approach allowing product teams to release improvements regularly and ensure that
2:56:34
the product continues to deliver value over time right so let's say in my first
2:56:40
launch I solved for higher income right my second priority let's say is uh
2:56:46
content quality or delivery right so And I will again go figure out how to solve
2:56:51
that. My next launch will be to solve that. My third then will be okay support
2:56:58
right. My fourth will be something else. And this will be a never- ending cycle.
2:57:03
So because the customer issues, needs the market itself will keep changing
2:57:10
over time and my product has to keep evolving over time. Examples,
2:57:18
a fitness app company wants to improve user engagement. Through surveys and interviews, they discover that their
2:57:23
users are struggling to stay motivated to work out alone and often unsure how to vary their exercise routines. So the
2:57:31
approach they take is they conduct user research to identify pain points, analyze survey responses, and conducting
2:57:37
interviews. They find that men want accountability and personalized exercise plans to stay on track. Right? I think
2:57:44
very similar to what we also did prioritizing based on value. So in the
2:57:50
fitness app case the team identifies several potential improvements. Social features for accountability,
2:57:56
personalized workout plan, gamified rewards. They realized that personalized workout plans addresses a primary user
2:58:02
pain point and might provide the most direct value and they use the Cano model
2:58:09
right which is basic needs, performance needs, excitement needs, right? must have more is better delight factors
2:58:16
and basic needs is rival workout training. Performance needs is personalized workout train and
2:58:21
excitement is your gamified rewards. And they decide to prioritize personalized
2:58:26
plans and schedule social features and gamification for later releases ensuring
2:58:32
the solution will have a immediate impact. Right? This is assuming that their reliable workout tracking kind of
2:58:39
already exists.
2:58:46
Defining the value prop for the fitness app. The value proposition might be stay motivated with a fitness app that
2:58:53
provides personalized workout plans tailored to your goals helping you build consistency, accountability, and variety
2:58:59
in your fitness fitness routine. Right. The value prop is crafted
2:59:06
based on the top needs identified. accountability, guidance, and workout variet. Let's move on. Designing
2:59:12
solutions around it. So the example is the fitness app team decides to add new features that offer customized workout
2:59:18
plans based on user preferences and fitness levels. Right? The features also include a progress tracker that helps
2:59:24
them visualize their achievements over time. So the approach is they collaborate with
2:59:30
UX designers, develop a prototype of their personalized workout planner. They
2:59:35
conduct usability tests right so that users can easily navigate the feature,
2:59:40
customize their plans, track progress and feedback from these tests is now used to refine the entire
2:59:47
before it actually goes full scale. Right? So what the takeaway from this is
2:59:54
they've thought of this feature. All right. They worked with their internal teams and they developed a prototype
3:00:01
which they again showed it to let's say a set of users got their feedback and
3:00:06
let's say probably tweaked a little bit here and there went full scale
3:00:13
and continuous learning and iteration is after launching the personalized workout plans. The team monitors user feedback
3:00:19
analytics data. They notice that users are enjoying their personalized plans but some are struggling with completing
3:00:25
workouts due to lack of motivation. Right? So the team decides to implement the social feature now that allows users
3:00:32
to connect with friends, share progress, hoping this will enhance accountability and motivation. They also regularly
3:00:38
update the app with new workout options based on user feedback to keep the content fresh and this started with the
3:00:46
that personalized workout feature rolled it out did a prototype saw the results
3:00:52
then rolled it out. Once they rolled it out they looked at their feedback analytics data they noticed that some
3:00:59
people are struggling with completing their workouts due to motivation. Right? Then they implemented the social feature
3:01:06
in right and now they will keep this iteration and learning process
3:01:12
continuously. This one now value communication
3:01:17
strategies. Okay. So value communication strategies are methods and tactics used to convey a product's value to customers
3:01:24
effectively. involves clearly communicating communicating how the product meets customer needs, standouts
3:01:31
from c competitors and provides benefit that justify its cost. Okay. So one is
3:01:37
obviously crafting a clear value proposition. So well definfined value proposition serves as the foundational
3:01:43
foundation for value communication. A concise statement that explains what makes the product valuable and unique.
3:01:50
This statement should highlight the specific customer needs, the product addresses, the key benefits it provides
3:01:57
and what differentiates it from the competitors. So this example that they're giving is if a product is an
3:02:04
eco-friendly cleaning solution, the value proposition could be eco-friendly cleaning product that is safe for your
3:02:09
family and effective on dust stains without harming the right. Again my I
3:02:15
think issue is this is if they are already calling it eco-friendly cleaning product then the rest of the statement
3:02:22
is not really required without harming the environment right because it is duplicating the same thing again
3:02:30
and again. Understanding and segmenting details this multiple times where
3:02:37
effective communication requires deep understanding of the audience. Se segment tailoring the message resonate
3:02:43
with each segment specific needs and preferences. Right? Segmentation allows
3:02:48
for targeting targeted messaging that speaks directly to the pain points and desires of the specific customer groups
3:02:54
whether based on demography, behavioral factors or buying motives. uh the earlier fitness app
3:03:02
uh small discussion that we had I think a lot of people said that you know we will have a value proposition which is
3:03:09
targeted to a certain segment for for let's say weight loss will be different muscle will be different right probably
3:03:16
age group wise can be different so this is the example that they have given for an all natural skincare brand segments
3:03:22
could include environmentally cautious customers people with sensitive skin and health focused
3:03:28
individuals. So each group would receive tailored messaging that aligns with their specific values and concerns.
3:03:35
And the third one is your choosing the right communication channel. Right? Uh different customers engage on different
3:03:41
platforms. So selecting the right channel is crucial. So this is primarily based on defining
3:03:49
which channel will you communicate on right. So if your TG is on
3:03:54
social media, you should be communicating effectively on those
3:03:59
platforms, right? If your TG let's say is
3:04:05
is newspaper, reads a lot of newspapers, you should probably use that channel. If it watches
3:04:11
a lot of TV, you should use that channel, right? Business professionals, that's it mentioned in the example,
3:04:17
LinkedIn probably is better. So then just choosing the right channel based on
3:04:23
who your TG is and where probably are they spending most of their
3:04:29
storytelling to highlight benefits. So this involves sharing real world
3:04:35
scenarios, customers testimonial, brand of show how the product solves the
3:04:40
problems or enhance their life. Storytelling also humani helps humanize
3:04:46
the brand making it easier for customers to connect emotionally. So, a fitness tracker band might share the story of a
3:04:51
customer who used the product to achieve their health goals, showing how it transformed their daily habits and helped them lead a healthier lifestyle.
3:05:00
Focusing on benefits over features. I think we also spoke already on this
3:05:05
wherein uh customers are more interested in knowing how a product will improve their lives rather than the technical
3:05:11
specifications. Right? language should probably focus on outcomes such as increased efficiency,
3:05:18
convenience, saving instead of simply listing product features. So rather than
3:05:23
just mentioning long battery life, the product can be positional positioned as enabling you to stay connected
3:05:29
throughout the day without worrying about recharging. Right? So if you see a lot of these ads,
3:05:36
right, uh they don't talk about the product benefits. So let's say I
3:05:43
remember there was once a uh an interview from Push Pande right uh who
3:05:50
is one of the advertising geniuses I was hearing and u he was talking about sort
3:05:57
of writing an ad copy for a pressure cooker brand right and when he
3:06:04
understood what the pressure cooker brand is trying to do right so their essential thing was that they made it a
3:06:10
little better which helps save time. So it helps cook faster
3:06:17
and that is what the company people told him that you know this is our pressure cooker. It will help you cook faster, save time. He said this is not what we
3:06:26
can communicate to the what we should communicate to the user that it helps save time. What you actually need to
3:06:32
tell the customer is let's say that housewife who and this is way back in
3:06:39
early '90s probably. So hence the housewife right uh
3:06:49
who's doing the cooking right and is in the kitchen for a very long
3:06:54
time. She's the one who is probably going to make the decision of buying this X
3:07:00
cooker versus Y cooker. So, we need to tell her and communicate to her that she
3:07:06
will get to spend more time with her family or relax or do whatever, right?
3:07:12
Because of buying this cooker and not the X cooker, not just the basic feature
3:07:18
key. Okay, this will help you save time, this is faster, all of that. What is the true benefit?
3:07:25
Right. So little more into that sense and that is what your communication sort
3:07:32
of building trust and credibility. I think all of us understand this that our
3:07:38
communication have all these things right. Uh trust building tactics, reviews, testimonials,
3:07:44
case studies, all of this bit right uh very obvious and very must have and
3:07:52
consistency. So for the ma value message to resonate
3:07:57
it needs to be consistent across all customer touch points from ads, social media, website content, instore
3:08:04
experience, everything has to be consistent. Like whenever you look at Apple their instore experience, the
3:08:10
banner ads they run, the video ads that they run, right? There is a certain
3:08:16
class and they talk about innovations and improving lives and stuff like that. and
3:08:23
that is consistent across all different advertisements and
3:08:29
messaging that they kind of do. So premium luggage brand that emphasizes durability and elegance should reflect
3:08:34
these values across every channel from its website design packaging to the
3:08:40
customer service. Right? Okay. So essentially what this entire thing is saying that if you saying in your uh
3:08:49
communication that we are a premium luxury brand also behave like one.
3:08:58
When the customer experiences you goes to your store or talks to your customer service guys you should actually feel
3:09:05
that this is a very premium luxurious brand that I'm talking to. So a great example is American Express.
3:09:13
Right? If you have their card, their entire proposition is for premium
3:09:19
customers. If you talk to their customer service people, no questions asked. They will exactly on point do what is
3:09:26
required. You will not get an answer key. Okay, I have written down your request. We will get back to you in 4
3:09:32
days or let me transfer you to this person. Let me do this. No, no, that's what that person will have all the
3:09:39
authority to solve all your problems. Right? So it just makes you will feel a little more special
3:09:45
and adapting the message over time is as the customer needs and dynamics change the communication strategy needs
3:09:51
adjustment. So gathering feedback, monitoring trends keeps the message relevant. Just like a
3:09:58
product feature set, the messaging will also have to keep evolving. So a productivity app might initially
3:10:04
emphasize time saving but later pivot to emphasize work life balance as more
3:10:10
users seek solutions to manage remote work. Cool. So co-creation with uh
3:10:15
customers right uh this essentially says that you involve customers in your
3:10:21
product development and messaging pro process right uh this approach allows
3:10:26
companies to understand and integrates customers insights directly resulting in products that resonate more effectively.
3:10:35
All right. So you directly align with customer needs and preferences. By involving customers early, companies get
3:10:42
a much clearer understanding of their needs, preferences, expectations. This firstand knowledge leads to more
3:10:47
relevant product features and benefits. All right. Uh creates a sense of
3:10:53
ownership and loyalty. So when customers feel involved in creating a product, they're more likely to feel invested in
3:10:58
it and in turn your share positive word of mouth or act as brand ambassadors for
3:11:03
it. Right? This trust amplifies the perceived value amongst the new potential customers.
3:11:10
All right. Third benefit is gathering feedback for clear customercentric
3:11:15
messaging. So customer feedback during this co-creation stage helps companies understand the language, terms and
3:11:21
phrasing that customers naturally use to describe the product value. And this insights allows for much more clearer,
3:11:27
more customer focused communication. So if you look at this example, skin care
3:11:33
brand testing prototypes with customers learns that users describe the product as calming, refreshing, right? Guiding
3:11:40
the brand's messaging to reflect these attributes instead of some technical jargon that they might have kind of
3:11:46
used. The fourth benefit is increasing trust through transparencies. When customers
3:11:52
are aware of their involvement, right, they perceive the brand as transparent, generally interested in delivering
3:11:58
values. This builds trust and credibility. This is very obvious, right?
3:12:03
And sh staying responsive to evolving customer needs. So co-creation is a
3:12:08
continuous feedback loop that allows brands to stay attuned to changing customer needs and preferences making it
3:12:14
easier to update messaging and keeping it relevant. Right. The final one is
3:12:20
reducing assumptions and increasing product market fit. Right? In by involving customers directly, company
3:12:26
minimizes the risk of misjudging what customers value the most. A product that
3:12:32
genuinely meets customer needs is easier to communicate as it delivers real demonstrable. Okay. Porter's value
3:12:39
chain. So Porter's value chain essentially is a strategic framework developed by Michael Porter, right? uh
3:12:45
it helps businesses understand the specific activities within their operations that create value for
3:12:51
customers and ultimately contribute to competitive advantage. Uh the model breaks down a company's process into
3:12:57
primary and support activities highlighting how each activity adds value. Right? So if you look at this
3:13:04
chart right these are your support activities. These are your primary activities right and then ultimately is
3:13:10
your value or margin which is getting created. So your primary activities are inbound logistics, operations, outbound
3:13:17
logistics, marketing and sales and service while your support activities are procurement, technology, human
3:13:23
resources, firm infrastructure. So just imagine in a company you have your verticals and horizontals, right? This
3:13:31
is pretty similar to that. So if you look at your primary
3:13:36
activities, there are core activities involved in creating and developing the product
3:13:43
which include inbound logistics. Activities related to receiving, storing, managing inputs like raw
3:13:49
materials, components and inventory. Effective inbound logistics can reduce cost and ensure a smooth production
3:13:56
process. Right? You have operations activity that transform inputs into
3:14:02
final products such as manufacturing operation, assembly operation, packaging operations, right? All of these. So
3:14:08
streamlining them can increase productivity and reduce production costs. Then you have your outbound
3:14:14
logistics which is distribution the distributing the finished products to your customers. This can include
3:14:19
warehousing, order fulfillment and delivery. Right? So reducing in delivery
3:14:24
times will enhance customer satisfaction. Marketing and sales. I think all of us understand activities in
3:14:31
time promoting and selling the product such as advertising, pricing strategy, sales tactics.
3:14:36
Strong marketing and sales can increase brand visibility and drive demand. And finally, your post sales activities that
3:14:42
support customers, installation, training, maintenance. So effective service can build customer loyalty and
3:14:48
lead to repeat business. Then these are your support activities. Firm infrastructure is your organizational
3:14:56
structure. management, finance, legal, other admin functions that keep the business running. You have your HRM
3:15:02
which is recruiting, training, retaining employees, technology development, product design, process automation,
3:15:09
technology management, right? And finally, your procurement, which is acquiring resources, materials and
3:15:14
services needed for the production. Effective procurement ensure that inputs of high quality and cost effective
3:15:22
support value creation in operations and logistics. So what this model essentially does, it
3:15:29
emphasizes that each activity in the value chain has potential to add value and impact a company's cost structure.
3:15:34
By optimizing and coordinating these activities, businesses can either reduce cost or differentiate their product
3:15:41
service. Cost advantage by identifying and reducing inefficiencies across the value chain. That is let's say
3:15:48
negotiating better contracts in the pro procurement or automating process in
3:15:53
operations can lower their overall cost. and differentiation advantages. Companies can enhance value chain
3:15:59
activities to create unique offerings. So let's say providing superior customer service using cutting edge technology or
3:16:05
creating a distinct brand. So this is primarily used to identify
3:16:12
key areas of improvement, enhance value for customers and benchmark against
3:16:17
customers. So you can analyze each activity, spot areas to improve. You can
3:16:23
focus on activities that directly impact customer satisfaction such as service and product quality and strengthen the
3:16:29
value proposition there. And you can compare your value chain activities with competitors to identify gaps and
3:16:35
opportunities for competitive advantage. So in a this is an example, right? In a
3:16:42
retail company, inbound logistics is streamlining supplier relationships to get high quality products quickly and at
3:16:49
a low cost. Operations will use technology to improve inventory
3:16:55
management and reduce stockouts. All right. Or even pileups, right? Outbound logistics will be
3:17:03
partnering with logistics firms for fast delivery and implementing order tracking. Marketing and sales will
3:17:08
leverage data to personalize all the marketing campaigns and service will be to offer a robust return policy and
3:17:14
excellent customer service. Measuring the effectiveness and uh second is improving
Measuring Value Delivery Effectiveness
3:17:21
the whole value delivery chain. Right? So I think I will not spend too much
3:17:27
time in measuring value. Right? We all understand that
3:17:32
you cannot improve if you cannot measure. Right? basic aspect and uh we
3:17:38
also I think by now kind of understand a lot of the metrics uh used for
3:17:46
measuring. So here are some of the metrics right for value delivery. Sees I
3:17:51
think seesat and NPS is something almost every company kind of does it right.
3:17:56
Sees measures the degree of satisfaction. NPS god's customer loyalty by asking how likely customers are to
3:18:03
recommend the company to others. Then you have your retention rate, lifetime value, the different product or services
3:18:12
metrics, right? Uh under customer support you can have your
3:18:17
customer effort score or your first contact resolution percentage. So multiple uh essentially ways of just
3:18:25
measuring different metrics rather to measure the ways we also already kind of
3:18:32
know this feedbacks, customer reviews, ratings, social listening tools, focus groups, right? Uh
3:18:40
then you can also analyze kind of operational data, delivery and fulfillment times, response times,
3:18:48
quality metrics, usage analytics, right?
3:18:53
Measure competitive positioning. So market share, customer acquisition rate,
3:18:59
price comparison, perceived value versus competitors, right? Uh I think this one also
3:19:09
measuring perceived value right uh versus compet I think is a bit of a
3:19:16
tricky one because how do you actually measure perceived value of let's say a
3:19:22
product or service versus a competitor calculating financial impact uh revenue
3:19:27
growth profit margins all of us understand CAC and CLV right So CLV CLV is also
3:19:37
very interesting here. So CLV is your customer lifetime value. Correct. So the
3:19:44
the calculation which goes in very simple terms if you can say it. Let's say I I am Swiggy. All right. I know
3:19:53
that on an average one customer orders let's say 10,000 worth of food per
3:19:59
month. My margin on that is after discounts everything is probably
3:20:04
somewhere about uh without discount let's say right now is 2,000 rupees
3:20:09
right 2,000 rupees per month is something that I will earn from the customer and I know that the customer
3:20:16
will if a customer comes in they normally stick with us for five seven years right so I will then multiply it
3:20:23
by 60 and then I'll figure out okay this is my customer lifetime value now this
3:20:28
customer lifetime Value is very important to kind of understand
3:20:35
for most of the companies because that defines a lot of things for them. So
3:20:40
that will define how much money can they spend on marketing to acquire new customers, right? So that is your CAC
3:20:48
which is your customer acquisition cost. So let's say Swiggy knows that over a 5year period a customer they will earn
3:20:54
let's say 5 lakh rupees from a customer just hypothetically right. So they know they can spend a lot
3:21:00
on marketing, right? They know they can do a lot of couponing and discounting
3:21:06
because they have a decent enough margin to play around with. So if you are
3:21:12
earning five lakh rupees, you can spend probably 50,000 rupees also to acquire and keep that customer engaged and give
3:21:19
keep giving him some discounts here and there, right? And that is how this whole business kind of pans out. So that is
3:21:26
why if you look at most of these uh platform companies when they come in they put in a lot of money on marketing
3:21:33
and discounts right because they know once you get
3:21:39
stuck then they will churn and make their money out of you right so that is
3:21:44
not a concern for them their major concern is the getting a customer and
3:21:49
ensuring that he stays at least initially till the point if they know that if let's say x threshold is crossed
3:21:56
Now this customer is all and he will keep sticking with us. So figuring out the CLV is hence the CAC
3:22:03
versus CLV ratio is very important for a lot of these companies. Then you have
3:22:08
your repeat percentage. So high repeat reflects strong value right that is why the customer is is sort of doing the
3:22:15
whole repeat purses and then obviously you do your set benchmarks and there's a continuous
3:22:21
improvement cycle. So this is an example of process for measuring the value
3:22:27
delivery effectiveness. Step one is collecting baseline data on seesat NPS
3:22:32
on different metrics right gather qualitative insights from customer feedback and social listening. Monitor
3:22:38
repeat purchase and customer retention rates monthly weekly you can do it whatever. Do a quarterly review of these
3:22:44
metrics. Compare them both internally benchmarks and with competitive data and then based on finding ad adjust
3:22:50
strategies. Right now it is on the now we kind of measured everything and how do we kind of improve
3:22:58
the process right so improving the process involves enhancing the ways in
3:23:03
which a company provides value to its customers ensuring that product services are delivered more effectively
3:23:09
essentially and in a way that it meets customer needs better right uh don't
3:23:14
look at the this one is wrong I'm sorry this header needs to change but uh the
3:23:20
crux is obviously understand needs and expectations right once we've measured
3:23:26
we will know where it is where things are breaking right what is going right what is not going right and then
3:23:32
obviously optimize the operational efficiency identify and eliminate bottlenecks right that slow down the
3:23:39
entire process so these are some examples they're giving implement lean process or automation in areas where we
3:23:45
can reduce cost improve speed invest in quality control right uh Ensure that
3:23:51
consistent product or service quality is getting delivered. Enhance the customer communication and transparency. So
3:23:57
keeping customers informed about each stage of the delivery process. So this is more let's say on a logistics piece.
3:24:04
We keep getting continuous updates, right? It is left the warehouse, it is in transit, it has reached local hub, it
3:24:12
is out for delivery, all of this bit, right? So this continuous updates is is
3:24:18
sort of also helps build customer trust and alleviates a lot of customer
3:24:24
anxiety. Leverage technology for process improvements or using data analytics and
3:24:29
CRM tools to identify patterns and optimize interactions and empower frontline employees right
3:24:37
train employees to provide excellent customer service and empower them to resolve issues. I think a lot of
3:24:43
companies kind of just fail here, right? Uh one great example that I've
3:24:49
personally seen is let's say MX, right? You talk to their calls
3:24:55
call center and the guy or the girl that you'll speak with, they will have absolute authority to kind of resolve
3:25:02
any issues for you, right? uh you will not get to hear that okay sir kindly
3:25:07
mail us or let me talk to my senior and I'll get back to you or all that sort
3:25:12
they will kind of just help you to solve the issue to the maximum possible limit
3:25:17
and even Amazon kind of provides and empowers their customer support uh
3:25:24
people a lot to resolve issues right because that is an important touch point
3:25:29
when it comes to customer satisfaction building trust and also gaining trust,
3:25:36
right? Monitor and improve after sales support. Uh
3:25:41
again, Indian companies kind of lack a lot here, right? Uh
3:25:49
continuously measure and refine. So keep tracking and the continuous improvement
3:25:54
cycle keeps kicking in. So that is it. So let's say this is for an e-commerce business. Improving the value delivery
3:26:01
process might involve using data analytics to predict demand and optimize inventory management, partnering with
3:26:08
reliable logistics providers to ensure delivery and offering post personalized
3:26:14
post-purchase support, right? Easy returns, all of that bit. Then quickly, let's move on to our newer topic.
3:26:24
So, strategic approaches. All right. Uh this is a more of a
3:26:32
management topic right uh what kind of strategies should we use what are the
Strategic Approach
3:26:37
different strategies all of that bit uh a lot of us already have
3:26:43
some or the other experience in kind of uh working with strategies defining
3:26:49
certain strategies so this will be an interesting topic with a lot of discussions that you know we can keep
3:26:54
having so what is strate strategy, right? Uh
3:27:00
except for the corporate jargon that is continuously thrown around in every company.
3:27:06
Uh strategy is essentially a deliberate plan of action designed to achieve long-term goals, right? By obviously
3:27:13
aligning resources, capabilities, and looking at opportunities while addressing challenges to create
3:27:19
sustainable value, right? uh it involves understanding the environment, setting priorities and making choices that drive
3:27:27
competitive advantage. So common misconceptions about strategy,
3:27:32
strategy is not the same as a plan, right? Strategy is about making fundamental choices and trade-offs while
3:27:39
plans are much more detailed. Strategy is static. It is not. Strategy keeps evolving, right? Strategy is only for
3:27:47
leaders. No, it is effective. Strategies involve inputs and alignment across all levels of the org. Unfortunately, this
3:27:54
does not really happen in a lot of orgs, right? Where strategy is mostly just drop
3:28:00
down driven, right? Somebody at the top creates a strategy and half of us have to now follow that without any
3:28:07
alignment, without any inputs from us, right? Without even understanding if that strategy at a let's say a ground
3:28:14
level will actually work or not. And then strategy equals goals. Goals are
3:28:20
what you aim to achieve. Strategy is the how. More strategy means better results. No
3:28:26
of well focused strategy is much more effective than multi multiple unfocused ones. Right? Uh so Porter's generic
3:28:35
strategy right uh so developed by Martin Porter. These strategies describe how
3:28:41
businesses can achieve competitive advantage in their industry. Multiple of them. One is cost leadership right
3:28:47
achieve the lowest production or service costs in the industry. So you have your e efficient production process play at
3:28:55
economies of scale right and then you cost control in material labor or
3:29:00
operations that is why you can offer the lowest price right and
3:29:07
the result is offer products and services at a lower price than competitors at writing price sensitive
3:29:12
customer right so examples given are Walmart and Ryer Jio the whole of Reliance Jio is also let's say a A cost
3:29:21
leadership strategy I would say right differentiation offer unique products or
3:29:26
services that customers perceive as valuable superior quality strong branding right unique features all of
3:29:34
that so charge a premium price due to perceived value and customer loyalty examples are Apple and Tesla I think all
3:29:40
of us kind of will agree to this right and the third one is the focus strategy
3:29:46
so target a specific niche market or audience Right? Achieve cost leadership in a
3:29:53
niche market. Example, Aldi is a low cost grocery store in I think Germany or
3:29:59
Europe somewhere. So cost focus. Then you have a sub strategy of cost focus or differentiation focus. Right? So cost
3:30:06
focus is Aldi. Differentiation focus is let's say Ferrari, right? It only looks at luxury sports cars. Uh result is
3:30:14
dominate a specialized segment with tailored offering. So businesses can choose one strategy to kind of avoid
3:30:20
being stuck in the middle where they fail to achieve cost leadership or differentiation effectively. Right?
3:30:26
Whereas if you look at most companies they want both. They want to offer the best product at the cheapest cost
3:30:33
usually and practically most of the time that is really not possible.
3:30:40
Right? So these are the three different types of strategies.
3:30:45
Developing competitive strategies. So developing strategies involves creating
3:30:51
approaches that enable a business to achieve sustainable advantage in the marketplace. Right? Uh process helps
3:30:58
differentiate the customer company meet customer needs and outperform competitors. So the steps defined here
3:31:04
are understand the market and competition. So market analysis, competition analysis, right? Define
3:31:11
clear visions and goals. So establish long-term objectives and ensure goals
3:31:17
are smart. Specific, smart is an acronym which stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound.
3:31:24
Right? So essentially a very well- definfined goal set.
3:31:29
So an example could be that we want to increase market share by 33%
3:31:36
in India in the next 6 months. Defining clear visions and goals and then choose a competitive positioning. So decide how
3:31:44
the company will compete in the market. Will we compete on cost leadership? Will we compete on differentiation or will we
3:31:51
compete on the focus and niche strategy? Right? Identify key resources and
3:31:58
capabilities. So assess resources such as technology, talent, financial capacity and leverage unique
3:32:05
capabilities. Develop an execution plan. And finally is monitor and adapt right
3:32:10
continuous improvement cycle that will keep making some minor changes here and
3:32:15
there in the entire process. So examples are Amazon which is following let's say the cost leadership
3:32:22
lowest prices efficient logistics right Nike is the differentiation strong banding innovation emotional appeal to
3:32:29
the customers and then roll slow is let's say the focus one where it only
3:32:34
targets the high-end niche market and key takeaways developing competitive
3:32:39
strategies is making deliberate choices core competency analysis so it is
3:32:46
essentially analyzing what are the core competencies of your company or your product, right?
3:32:53
Unique skills, technologies or processes, resources that one provide significant value to customers and
3:33:00
second differentiate the organizations from competitors, right? And the third
3:33:05
biggest point is are challenging to replicate or substitute. This is essentially what we call creating a
3:33:13
moat, right? What is your mo or what is your key?
3:33:20
What is that one thing that kind of nobody else can do right? That is the core competency here. So, example, Apple
3:33:27
is user centered design and innovation. Honda is their expertise in engine and powertrain technology. Right? Uh what
3:33:35
else? What else is a good example of a core competency? Let's say
3:33:41
for for Netflix, right? Uh it can be the quality of the content
3:33:49
that they have right uh because they spend a massive amount on just creating
3:33:55
your content but this is your instead of compet yes competitive you will get
3:34:00
competitive advantage because of your core competency right so steps to identify this is one
3:34:06
identify key strengths analyze internal capabilities such as talent technology process and IP right what does the
3:34:13
company do exceptionally well evaluate against core competency criteria. So to
3:34:19
qualify the core competency anything has to one deliver value right contribute to
3:34:24
customer satisfaction loyalty all of that bit second is be unique offer differentiation from customers and third
3:34:31
is be inimitable right so be challenging or
3:34:38
very difficult for c competitors to copy link to competitive advantage right
3:34:45
determine how the competent competencies enable the company to perform better than competitors. Identify products or
3:34:52
services that benefit directly from these trends. And then the fourth point is align with strategic goals. Ensure that core competencies align with the
3:34:59
company's mission and long-term objectives. Use these competencies to explore new opportunities or markets.
3:35:07
Benefits of analysis are focus resource focuses resources on areas of strength,
3:35:13
drives innovation, helps prioritize strategic initiatives and fourth is enhances decision- making regarding
3:35:20
outsourcing or partnerships. The example Amazon core competencies are logistics
3:35:25
and supply chain management, customer data analytics and technology innovation. So the application is
3:35:31
essentially efficiently delivers products globally at competitive prices while offering personalized customer
3:35:37
experiences. Okay. So this is one part of I think developing the entire
3:35:42
strategy. First understanding what is your company's core competency. So these
3:35:49
are some more examples. Reliance Industries is expertise in petrochemicals and refining. Integrated
3:35:54
supply chain across oil to chemicals and retail and diversification into telecom
3:35:59
with cutting edge digital infrastructure economies of scale and efficient cost
3:36:05
management. You have Tata Group. What are their core competencies? Strong brand reputation
3:36:10
and trustworthiness. Right? They have a diversified portfolio, leadership in innovation through TCS
3:36:17
data motors and a global presence with strong foothold in multiple industries.
3:36:22
Infosys core competencies, expertise in IT consulting and outsourcing, strong focus on innovation and digital
3:36:29
transformation, efficient delivery model like global delivery model, an exceptional talent
3:36:35
development and employee retention practices. Though the last one is a little debatable but sure. Mahindra and
3:36:41
Mandra they have listed leadership in SUVs and tractors, expertise in rural
3:36:47
market penetration and customer understanding, diverse presence, strong innovation
3:36:53
and finally I think HDFC which is advanced digital banking platform, innovative financial products, strong
3:37:00
customer relationship management, superior risk management and operational efficiency and wide distribution
3:37:06
network. Right? I think the main two are the last two parts for HDFC where they
3:37:12
have a superior risk management and operational efficiency right and all this wide distribution network that
3:37:18
they've set up across urban and rural areas flipkart
3:37:24
expertise in e-commerce logistics and last mile delivery strong understanding of Indian customer innovative payment
3:37:31
solutions right they came up with the whole cash on delivery bit as well and efficient inventory management and
3:37:38
supply chain Maruti Suzuki leadership in passenger vehicles, expertise in lowc cost
3:37:44
manufacturing and fuel efficient vehicles. Right? I think that is the main one and strong brand loyalty and
3:37:49
affordability is is definitely one of them. H is wide product portfolio, strong
3:37:58
marketing and distribution network, right? Uh innovation in product formulations obviously and economies of
3:38:04
scale. I think for for HL again it is the whole distribution that they have
3:38:09
and obviously the product innovation that they keep doing. Vipro is very similar to Infosys right
3:38:15
Bajage auto I think again is very similar to Maru Suzuki but let's say more on the two-heer and three-wheeler
3:38:22
side of things. SWAT analysis. I think all of us or a lot of us must
3:38:27
know this already, right? Uh SWAT analysis essentially is a tool to
3:38:33
evaluate organizational internal and external environment. It kind of identifies key
3:38:39
factors that influence success and informs decision- making. So essentially is nothing but a graph wherein you plot
3:38:46
your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Okay. So what are the
3:38:52
strengths of your or let's say so examples could be strong brand reputation skilled workflows proprietary
3:38:58
technology right how can you figure this out is you ask questions like what does the company do well what unique
3:39:04
resources that we have right weaknesses internal limitations or challenges that hinder
3:39:11
performance or growth so limited financial resources inefficient processes let's say weak online presence
3:39:18
could be an example right so essentially What can the company improve? What are
3:39:23
we lacking? Right? Or let's say what are the negative reviews about? So that could come into your weaknesses.
3:39:30
Opportunities are external factors or strength that organization can leverage for growth. So example could be emerging
3:39:36
market, technology advancement, shift in customer preferences. So this is more about sort of identifying what trends
3:39:42
can we take advantage of. Are there an is there an existing gap in the market that we can sort of fill, right?
3:39:50
And then finally you have your threat which is external risk or challenges that could
3:39:56
harm the organization's position. So intense competition, economic is
3:40:02
macroeconomic issues, regulatory changes, right? Uh so what obstacles do
3:40:08
we face? What are competitors doing that could impact us? Right? So any external
3:40:15
threat that you have comes under your threats. how to conduct a SWAT analysis, gather
3:40:21
stakeholders, right? Brainstorm all these factors, prioritize the most important impactful factors and then
3:40:28
obviously you develop strategies that you know use these insights to align strengths with opportunities and
3:40:33
mitigate weaknesses and threats. So benefits give you a little more clarity.
3:40:40
It helps in decision making right especially on the strategic planning and prioritization bits right and then it
3:40:47
sort of aligns the entire au so that we can focus much better so here's an
3:40:52
example of a Netflix what analysis so strength is strong brand vast content library global reach weakness is high
3:40:59
operating cost reliance on subscription opportunities is expanding into new
3:41:04
markets leveraging AI for recommendations and threats is intense competitions
3:41:09
content piracy right so this is how they've kind of so this is an example of Netflix versus
3:41:17
Amazon right uh strengths they have listed market leader in streaming high
3:41:23
quality content advanced personalization available in 190 countries with
3:41:28
multilingual support for Amazon Prime Video it is part of the Amazon's ecosystem financial backing from Amazon
3:41:36
diverse content library bundle benefits Right. Weakness is heavy reliance on
3:41:41
subscription revenue while the weakness for app prime videos relatively smaller
3:41:47
original content. Right. High production costs can be seen as a secondary service
3:41:52
to Amazon's e-commerce. Saturation in key markets. UI is less intuitive.
3:41:58
Right. Opportunities expand into untapped markets. Leverage Amazon's
3:42:03
massive ecosystem to offer exclusive cross category promotions for Netflix. Again it is experience experiment with
3:42:10
new revenue models. Invest in localized regional content. For Amazon it is expand
3:42:16
focus on live sports and events. Partner with third party services to enhance content offerings and threats is intense
3:42:24
competition from others. Rising production cost, piracy
3:42:29
and account sharing. Right here is your intense competition again. Regulatory
3:42:34
changes related to content and e-commerce dependency on bundling with prime may dilute it standalone value
3:42:41
proposition. Strategic business units and relevance SBUS right uh so SBUs are
3:42:47
essentially a distinct division or segment within a larger organization that operates as an independent entity
3:42:53
with its own mission objectives and competitive strategies. So each SBU
3:42:58
focuses on a specific market or product line and is responsible for its profitability and strategic planning. So
3:43:05
example if you just want to understand what is an SBU. So Proctor and Gamble right uh separate SBUS for beauty
3:43:13
grooming healthcare right for let's say Apple
3:43:18
iPhone services accessory each of them them will have their own business units
3:43:23
right all of us know that every company has multiple business units. So that is what this entire topic is right. The
3:43:31
characteristics of SBU has distinct market focus right targets a specific customer segment or market has its own
3:43:38
resources which essentially is independent in nature separate profitability evaluation is based on its
3:43:44
performance and contribution and autonomy and decision- making operate semi-independently right so let's say
3:43:51
operationally they have a lot more independence and decision-m but strategically they still have to let's
3:43:56
say align with uh the overall company per se Right. Relevance of SBUs in
3:44:01
strategic management is focused strategic development. Right? Each SBU can develop tailor strategy to address
3:44:08
its unique market conditions, performance accountability, resource allocation, market adaptability and
3:44:14
competitive advantage. End goal is like by focusing on these different specific markets and products,
3:44:21
SBOs essentially create opportunities for specialization, innovation and enhancing competitive positioning.
3:44:27
Right? because then they they are focused on that particular segment and they can innovate much better there. So
3:44:35
SBU and corporate study BCG matrix and SBU. So a common tool used is the BCG
3:44:41
matrix right? uh we if you remember we had we have already studied the BCG
3:44:47
matrix where we have your star you have your cash cow you have your question mark and your dogs right so companies
3:44:54
essentially position their SU in one of these four right and then this essentially pri
3:45:00
helps them prioritize investments and strategic actions right challenges are
3:45:06
obviously coordination issues right uh resource competition because each is
3:45:11
kind of competing internally and risk of siloing right there can be a limit to
3:45:17
the synergies and the alignment that uh you know the at overall company
3:45:22
level. Key takeaways is SBUS enable large organizations to manage complexity
3:45:28
by focusing on specific products or product lines allowing for targeted strategies efficient resource allocation
3:45:34
and better accountability. Right? So strategic planning, implementation
3:45:40
and control. Essentially these are the three key stages of strategic management that guide organizations in achieving
3:45:46
their goals. Together they form a cyclical process to plan, execute and evaluate. So this is your plan. The
3:45:52
first one is a planning stage where the process of defining an organization's long-term objectives and the best course
3:45:58
of action to achieve them. So your steps in strategic planning is vision and mission, environmental analysis. So
3:46:05
let's say your your SWAT analysis right setting objectives establishing goals
3:46:10
and strategic formulation which is developing action plans allocating resources all of that. So example given
3:46:17
here is a tech company plans to increase market share by 20% over 3 years through product innovation and strategic
3:46:22
partnerships right so this is let's say their vision vision and vision probably
3:46:27
then comes the implementation part right where you put the strategic plan into action so key elements are resource
3:46:35
allocation organizational structure so aligning teams roles and processes to
3:46:40
support the execution right communication so that all levels of the
3:46:46
organization are aware of it. Then you have your operational plans which is break down the strategy into actionable
3:46:52
task and timelines and leadership and accountability assign leadership to oversee initiatives and ensure progress.
3:46:59
Example given is a retail company expands into e-commerce by launching new website training staff investing in
3:47:05
digital marketing campaigns. control right this is the process of
3:47:10
monitoring evaluating and then tweaking the strategies to ensure that they achieve the desired outcomes.
3:47:17
So performance management right use KPIs regular reviews then you have your
3:47:22
feedback mechanisms get the insight from employees customers and then obviously
3:47:28
you have your course corrective measures right so the interconnection of these three
3:47:34
stages is planning sets the direction implementation drives action and then
3:47:39
control essentially ensures alignment okay
3:47:46
this is I think for everything in product management or management per se. This is the this is let's say the high
3:47:52
level framework where you plan right you execute and then you kind of keep
3:47:58
measuring and realigning the entire uh setup basis the feedback
3:48:03
that you keep gathering right so topic is essentially disruptive
Disruptive Innovation and Product Strategy
3:48:09
innovation and product strategy right disruptive innovation is something disruption in the tech world is
3:48:15
something we keep hearing often right so disruptive innovation is actually A concept introduced by Clinton
3:48:21
Christensen that describes a process where a simpler, cheaper or more accessible product or service initially
3:48:28
enters a market targeting a niche or underserved market segment and over time it improves and eventually displaces
3:48:34
established competitors in the mainstream market. Right? It is a dis it is distinct from sustaining innovation
3:48:41
which focuses on improving existing products. Right? So it is something where you completely bring a new
3:48:48
solution. You start off with a smaller segment or a niche segment in that market and then you grow it and
3:48:55
completely displace the existing companies processes in that market.
3:49:01
Right? I I'm assuming all of us kind of already understand to a certain extent
3:49:06
what what this is. Right? So characteristics of disruptive innovation is begins in a niche market, focuses on
3:49:14
accessibility and affordability, right? Gradual improvements later on, right?
3:49:19
And displaces incumbents over time. Okay. Examples PCs. PCs initially
3:49:25
targeted hobbies and small businesses, right? Due to their limited computer power compared to mainframes. Over time,
3:49:31
as performance improved, they disrupted the mainframe and many computer markets. Then we digital photography, right? Uh
3:49:39
all of us know the great example of how Kodak died. Digital cameras started as
3:49:44
low resolution and expensive but gradually improved to disrupt the film photography industry. Online education
3:49:50
platforms like Koser and Khan Academy begin by providing free and lowcost education challenging traditional
3:49:56
universities and institutions. Though they haven't completely removed the existing incumbents, right? But to a
3:50:03
large extent they have created a whole new bigger market for education with the
3:50:08
solution that they came up with. So why is it important? Essentially it encourages market expansion, introduces
3:50:15
solutions to provide previously untapped or underserved markets, drives competition and progress and opens new
3:50:21
opportunities. So here are some examples. Ride sharing Uber andyft. Why
3:50:26
disruptive? I think all of us know right and platforms provide convenient app-based solution cheaper more reliable
3:50:33
than taxis initially attracted price sensitive users and those frustrated by tax taxi availability there's another
3:50:40
story behind Uber and if I'm correct when they started right they started off as a limoine service right a ultra
3:50:48
premium luxury taxi service right targeting let's say only the top 1.1%
3:50:54
and uh gradually They made it mass market. So they didn't start off
3:51:00
something like an Ola in India where it just started with a big bang and everybody could use book cabs because
3:51:06
Ola is essentially a copycat, right, of Uber. So when Uber originally disrupted the market, they started off as a very
3:51:13
in a very niche market with a completely innovative solution and then kind of expanded the market. Bitcoin AI
3:51:20
definitely falls. Robotics or definitely falls. UPI. I don't even remember the last time I used a card or or cash
3:51:29
streaming services, you know, Netflix, Spotify, right? Netflix began as a mail order DVD rental, but then transition to
3:51:35
streaming offering on demand affordable entertainment. Spotify disrupted the music CDs, physical CDs by offering
3:51:41
subscription based music library. Then you have airlines where Ryionaire and Southwest, right? But uh they eliminated
3:51:47
by by eliminate they started by eliminating non-essential services like meals assigned seating all of that and
3:51:54
they targeted price sensitive travelers eventually capturing a significant market share smartphones all of us know
3:51:59
what Apple iPhone did with the whole phone business right uh e-commerce platforms Amazon and Alibaba Amazon
3:52:07
primarily in the B2C space Alibaba primarily into the B2B e-commerce space
3:52:12
right uh digital payment solutions PayPal then Mosquare UPI as well. EVs is
3:52:18
Tesla is a great example in MOC's, Corserai, AEX, Khan and cloud computing
3:52:24
AWS, Microsoft Azure. So I don't know if you guys know this AWS essentially
3:52:30
started off as an internal tool for for Amazon, right? Uh and they quickly figured that this is something that you
3:52:37
know that a larger segment of the market can really use and from there they kind of started uh building and selling AWS
3:52:44
to other companies. So from an internal tool it became into a company of its own. Then there are 3D printing. 3D
3:52:51
printing though honestly I don't think it has really disrupted any market or or had a very major impact. There has been
3:52:57
a lot of hype around this for a very long time but I I honestly think right now it's it's almost a dead market. So
3:53:04
disruptive innovation versus sustaining innovation right there's a clear distin
3:53:09
difference wherein in disruptive the focus is on serving new or underserved markets while in sustaining innovation
3:53:16
is improving products for existing customers right marketing market impact
3:53:22
creates new markets or redefineses industries right sustaining innovation is strengthens existing markets
3:53:27
performance initially lower for disruptive innovation performance builds on existing product capab abilities
3:53:34
examples we already know. So not every technology is disruptive. Many innovations are sustaining improving
3:53:40
existing products without transforming markets. Right? U disruption is a process not an event. It takes years for
3:53:47
a disruptive innovation to fully impact an industry and obviously incumbents can respond while many fail. Some innovate
3:53:54
successfully to counter disruption. Right? So this line which which says not every technology is disruptive. Right?
3:54:01
Can you give me some examples of let's say nondisruptive innovation? Okay,
3:54:07
let's move next. All right, so there are some models and theory about disruptive innovation. First in the Clayton's
Disruptive Innovation Models and Theories
3:54:14
disruptive innovation theory. So it was origin in this book called the innovator's dilemma. Key idea is
3:54:20
disruptive innovations initially target underserved or non-consuming customer segments with simpler and more affordable solutions. Over time they
3:54:27
improve to meet the needs of mainstream customers. Example is Netflix started as a mail order deliver mail order DVD
3:54:34
service for niche customers dissatisfied with blockbuster and eventually now they've disrupted the entire
3:54:40
entertainment industry with streaming. Right? Uh significance theory is foundational for understanding how small
3:54:46
entrance challenge established players by creating new market dynamics. Then you have your jobs to be done theory. So
3:54:53
jobs to be done theory the key idea is customer hire product or services to perform specific jobs or solve
3:55:00
particular problems in their lives. So Uber solves the job of convenient and
3:55:05
affordable transportation particularly in markets underserved by traditional taxis. Right? Uh the significance here
3:55:11
is it helps innovators focus on the core needs of customers often uncovering opportunities for discovering for
3:55:18
disruption by addressing unmet or overlooked jobs. So this is also a very popular uh framework in in product
3:55:24
wherein a lot of product managers try to analyze customer behavior in terms of
3:55:30
what are the different jobs to be done and they break down the entire journey in in jobs to be done and then for each
3:55:36
job they start figuring out what is the current situation what is the current solution what is what could be made
3:55:43
better and how can I make it better and they kind of think in that framework
3:55:49
right it is essentially Not just saying I want uh I want to buy a t-shirt, right? That is obviously what
3:55:56
the customer wants. But then if you try to break it down in jobs to be done, you will see there are multiple jobs to be
3:56:03
done, right? So let's say just buying a t-shirt online, the first job to be done
3:56:08
is searching for a t-shirt, right? Discovery and search, search and discovery. Second is looking at the
3:56:15
details, right? uh type of cloth, sizing, price point, quality, multiple
3:56:22
things, right? Figuring out the details. Now I can further break down this details bit into multiple jobs. And
3:56:28
third piece is the payments or rather the delivery address. Adding my personal details, delivery address, name, mobile
3:56:35
number, all of that. Fourth job is entering the payment details. Fifth job here is the whole uh what do you call
3:56:42
it? delivery piece, the logistics piece, right? So just this one journey, I can
3:56:48
break it down into multiple jobs and I can further deep down into each job and see what is the current situation,
3:56:55
solution and how do I make it better and then the final is your technology adoption life cycle. So the key idea
3:57:02
here is innovation spread through distinct adopter groups, right? Innovators, early adopters for the
3:57:08
majority, late majority and lagards. The challenge for disruptive innovations lies in crossing the chasm between early
3:57:15
adopters and early majority. So Tesla's initial success with tech enthusiasts that is innovators eventually
3:57:21
transitioned into a broader market adoption. So the significance is guides companies in managing the adoption curve
3:57:28
and scaling disruptive technologies. So there is this is a very normal market
3:57:35
strategy used especially by high high-end tech companies wherein whenever they're launching a new product right
3:57:42
they first try to identify who are the let's say the innovators or early adopters in that space right and they
3:57:51
kind of target them focus on them do a pilot with them right get certain feedback see how it is going and then
3:57:59
slowly open up the market for the rest of you know this the market segment. So
3:58:06
let's say in Zeppto's case or let's say in in India right the entire startup
3:58:11
space if you look at it is primarily based in Bangalore Y. So a lot of these innovators who people who are interested
3:58:17
in newer technology who are willing to try newer technology are present there right. So a lot of these new startups
3:58:23
start off in Bangalore, do a small pilot there, figure out customer reaction behaviors, what needs to be changed,
3:58:30
right? And then they slowly increase their audience, right? Then they'll come to probably people like me who who are
3:58:37
part of let's say early majority and slowly and slowly they'll go to then they'll reach probably somebody like my
3:58:44
mom who is probably a lagard right in terms of adopting newer technology. So
3:58:49
the the significance here also is depending on what stage you are at and what type of persona you're targeting
3:58:57
your feature sets and your priorities will kind of matter right uh so let's
3:59:02
say if you're targeting my mom right uh and you want to develop a tech solution
3:59:08
for her right you first need to identify that she she is a lagard in adopting new
3:59:13
technology right and what are the challenges that come with it and then kind of build a solution around
3:59:19
So a simple WhatsApp, yes, it worked thankfully fine and she can use WhatsApp
3:59:24
the way it is. But if uh WhatsApp really wanted to do that and really wanted to
3:59:30
ensure that everybody can use it, they would probably start building some more features wherein older people or
3:59:37
children, right, uh can use WhatsApp a little more conveniently. They would
3:59:42
have probably brought in the whole uh voice feature a little more earlier, right? uh which came I think in my head
3:59:49
quite late especially given that India is one of the is is the largest market for WhatsApp right so these are some
3:59:57
kind of models here okay so there are two more theories under innovation blue ocean strategy I
4:00:04
don't know if a lot of you must have heard about this it's a very popular you know strategy this blue ocean strategy
4:00:10
so what it says is there are essentially two types of oceans one is a red ocean one is a blue ocean Red ocean is where
4:00:18
there's a lot of competition, right? Uh there's a defined space that you can
4:00:23
play in, right? Uh while there's a completely new blue ocean that you can
4:00:29
create, right? By offering a completely new value proposition that opens an
4:00:34
uncontested market. There's no competitor there. There market also kind of does not even exist today. and you as
4:00:41
an innovator coming in with a product or service that essentially creates a new market completely. All right. So that is
4:00:48
the blue ocean strategy. And then finally we have the scurve theory, right? Where it says that innovation
4:00:54
performance follows an S-curve. So you'll see a slow slow growth initially, right? So let's
4:01:01
say slow growth, then that growth will pick up and then it'll plateau, right?
4:01:06
So it will something go like this. If you can see my cursor, this is something how it'll kind of grow. What it does is
4:01:14
so example is given personal computers followed the scurve started with limited capabilities and then improved rapidly
4:01:21
to disrupt mainframes and mini computers, right? Uh let's say the the
4:01:26
IC engine, right? The engine that we kind of even have today, it started off with very less power, right? Over time,
4:01:34
power increased, right? And then the horse carriages slowly got wept out once
4:01:41
we had much more power than what horses can could deliver. Right? So it
4:01:47
essentially helps predict when disruptive technologies will outperform established ones aiding in strategic
4:01:52
timing for investments and product development. So you don't want to be right at let's say if you're an investor
4:01:58
you don't want to be at the very beginning of a new technology because the risk is also very high right you
4:02:05
ideally want to go be somewhere when that scurve that exponential growth is kind of taking place you want to be
4:02:12
somewhere here because your risk is much lesser now because you can see growth
4:02:17
right and the time it'll your your return on investment will soon will be
4:02:23
much faster So it kind of just helps you decide when to invest and which space to
4:02:29
be in when like let's say right now everybody wants to be in in let's say
4:02:34
the whole agentic AI LLM right uh chat GPT business because that exponential
4:02:41
growth curve has started chat GPT has been kind of trying to build an LM for
4:02:47
the past I don't know 7 8 10 years right that is was the very initial period of
4:02:52
it and Not a lot of companies were interested. Only very few of them invested some money in it. But now that
4:02:59
it kind of picked up now everybody wants to get into this and soon it'll you'll see that you know it'll start replacing
4:03:05
a lot of the existing technology. My view is in the next 5 years probably we will will not see people using excels
4:03:12
and word documents and all of that because all the basic stuff that you can do on a word dock on an excel will very
4:03:18
easily be done in charge. These are two more theories. Cool. All right then.
4:03:24
Let's move on. So this is another framework called the Ansoft product market expansion grid. So this is
Ansoff’s Product Market Expansion Grid
4:03:30
nothing but a framework to identify sort of growth opportunities for business.
4:03:36
Right? It outlines four primary strategies based on whether a company is introducing new or existing products
4:03:43
into new or existing markets. Okay. So there's a permutation combination of new
4:03:50
product, existing product and new market, existing market. All right. So
4:03:55
this the chart looks something like this. New market, existing market, existing product, new product. So when
4:04:02
you are doing let's say an existing product in an existing market then the strategy that we need to follow is the
4:04:08
market penetration strategy. Right? when we are doing a existing market and a new
4:04:13
product then we follow the product development strategy according to ANSOF right and when we do let's say a new
4:04:21
market but existing products then we need to do market development and new markets new products is essentially a
4:04:27
complete diversification so in each of these strategies there are certain steps that we can follow right uh that is what
4:04:35
is outlined here so if you look at it in the market penetration strategy right wherein You have an existing product and
4:04:42
an existing market. The focus is on ex increasing market share within the current market using existing products.
4:04:48
Strategies enhance marketing efforts, attract competitors, customers, increase product users using existing customers.
4:04:55
Right? So example is Coca-Cola running promotional campaigns to increase sales in regions where it already dominates.
4:05:01
Basically, it's either you acquire your competitor's customers or you increase the usage of your existing customers. So
4:05:09
that is how you penetrate market in a existing market existing product situation. When there's a new product
4:05:14
existing market then essentially you're developing and introduce new products to the existing customer base. Then the
4:05:20
strategy that we can follow is innovate or enhance current product offerings or launch complimentary products. So Apple
4:05:26
introducing new versions of the iPhone. It's an existing market but it's a new product. So they follow the product
4:05:31
development where they are kind of with every version they innovate a little. They enhance the offerings all of that
4:05:37
bit. And the third one is market development. So if you have an existing product and a new market, then your
4:05:43
strategy is to enter international markets, target different demographies or industries. So Netflix expanding its
4:05:50
streaming services into emerging markets like India, right? That is market development strategy. And
4:05:55
diversification is new product, new market, right? So enter new markets with completely new products. This is the
4:06:01
riskiest strategy due to lack of familiarity with both the product and the market. So related diversification
4:06:07
is let's say new products are somewhat related to existing offering. Tesla moving into battery storage or let's say
4:06:13
one of these FMCG companies launching a new vertical of food or something of
4:06:18
that sort unrelated diversification is entering completely different industries. So Amazon acquiring whole
4:06:23
foods to enter the grocery sector. Google venturing into hardware with its pixel smartphones and I think that is
4:06:31
also unrelated diversification. Key benefits of once we do this essentially
4:06:36
is strategic clarity. It provides a clear structure for thinking about growth opportunities. Risk assessment
4:06:42
highlights the relative risk of each strategy with market penetration being the least least risky and
4:06:47
diversification being the most helps business align their growth strategy with the resources market conditions and goal. So application is market research,
4:06:54
identifying new customer needs or geographic opportunities, product road mapping, planning, product enhancement
4:06:59
or launches based on the strategic goals and portfolio management obviously balancing risk and investment across
4:07:05
various growth strategies. Cool. So this is it.
4:07:12
So it refers to the challenge of balancing the existing business while trying to innovate. Right? uh
New Product Development Process
4:07:18
organizations often feel face a lot of resistance as well right from internal stakeholders processes
4:07:26
other partners all right so any change is difficult for everyone right and once
4:07:32
a business is set people tend to kind of just want to follow the same process the same old methods and keep churning money
4:07:41
so example if you look at this resistance to change will come from employees managers and leadership right
4:07:46
they will want to resist disrupting a profit profitable and established system. Fear of losing market dominance,
4:07:53
revenue streams or operational stability. Then you have your resource allocation dilemma as well. Uh
4:08:02
finite resources, right? Where do you want to invest? Should we just keep investing on the current existing
4:08:08
products, right? Uh or should we want to sort of invest some more money in
4:08:14
innovation? Because innovation usually takes a decent amount of investment as well uh not just
4:08:20
in terms of money but let's say even employee cost right uh and that is a
4:08:27
valuable resource for every company so that is also a challenge then you have risk aversion which is topmost if you
4:08:33
have established businesses they are very risk averse right uh they want
4:08:38
predictable returns they want to share the show it to their shareholders all of that bit right so again doing something
4:08:45
disruptive is a little tough there. Then you have cultural and structural barriers which to a certain extent is
4:08:52
still okay, right? Where traditional hierarchy of structures do not kind of support this innovation thinking, right?
4:09:00
Uh and then finally you have your customer based expectations. Existing customers often demand continuous
4:09:06
improvements in their offerings, right? Uh so like with Swiggy as a customer, my
4:09:13
expectation is that it gets better at delivery. it gets better at let's say the restaurants
4:09:19
that it has uh it gets better at pricing it all of that bit right now with Swiggy
4:09:26
I do not have a other sort of an expectation where I want them to completely build a new business that
4:09:33
is not my expectation with Swiggy right so if you look at all these multiple
4:09:39
things in entirety right these are a lot of and valid very valid challenges that
4:09:44
you know all these companies face uh while trying to be disruptive. That is why if I'm sure in all our organizations
4:09:51
there are a lot of talk about uh innovation and you know doing something new and all
4:09:58
of that but often uh we see very little of it actually happening right because a
4:10:05
new exciting idea might is just that but once it starts getting more serious
4:10:10
about it okay which team should we put on it how much money should we put on it
4:10:16
right what will happen to the existing one Will that break? Then suddenly all
4:10:22
companies start realizing that it is not so easy. Right? So these are the challenges. Let's move strategies for
4:10:29
managing you know the status quo. So build a dual innovation strategy. So
4:10:35
rather also called an ambidextrous organization. So separate teams or units handle sustaining and disruptive
4:10:41
innovation. So example is given. IBM created autonomous units to explore cloud computing and AI without
4:10:48
disrupting its core business, right? Educate and align stakeholders, provide
4:10:54
training on the importance all of that with share success stories.
4:11:00
Encourage experimentation, right? Adopt a culture of innovation where small low-risk experiments are encouraged. So
4:11:07
example is a very nice example where Google allows employees to dedicate 20% of their time to innovative product
4:11:14
projects, right? Uh leverage agile and lean methods. So use agile principles to iterate rapidly.
4:11:21
Apply lean startup techniques to test and validate disruptive concepts. Monitor and respond to market signals.
4:11:27
So use market research and competitive intelligence to identify emerging threats and opportunities. act early to
4:11:35
either counteract potential disruptors or a embrace the disruptive. Okay. Then
4:11:41
you have reallocate resources strategically where dedicate a certain percentage right of budget hours and
4:11:50
then adopt a long vision uh look beyond short-term profitability to focus on long-term sustainability right this you
4:11:58
know all these are if you think of it in theory very nice
4:12:03
read no right uh but in real life how how does it really happen
4:12:10
we know there some very innovative companies let's say Amazon Tesla right
4:12:17
Facebook also meta rather to a certain extent right right this slide which
4:12:23
talks about all these different things I think the biggest aspect
4:12:29
the culture right the culture and access to resources if you have these two
4:12:35
things then yes you can sort of do some innovation and and some innovation can
4:12:41
come out of it right uh apart from that I don't think there is anything else
4:12:47
that uh works right uh you can try using a dual strategy this strategy all of
4:12:53
that bit but if these two things are not there access to a lot of resources
4:12:59
willing and the willingness to to essentially risk it as well
4:13:05
that is I think the only way to to actually and truly innovate because it's
4:13:11
not like you will think of one idea and okay it'll work right out of 100 ideas probably one work so you'll need to have
4:13:18
one the money to spend on 100 different ideas right and secondly the heart also
4:13:26
to see 99 of them so here are some case studies right uh
4:13:32
one is Kodak it failed to embrace digital photography despite inventing it fearing it would cannibalize its film
4:13:39
business, right? So, they looked at their current business. They said, "Oh, this this thing will,
4:13:45
you know, cannibalize our existing business. Let's not let's not really do anything much about it." Then you have
4:13:52
Microsoft which successfully transitioned to cloud computing with Azure while maintaining its current
4:13:58
enterprise software business. Right? So, there was a separate innovation team which kind of helped from within without
4:14:05
destabilizing the gold business. And then you have Tesla which focused on disrupting the automotive industry while
4:14:11
maintaining a clear strategy for scaling EV through high-end and mass market vehicles. A clear long-term vision right
4:14:19
can align disruptive innovation with market red. Key takeaways is balance is essential. Managing status quo doesn't
4:14:26
mean abandoning it but kind of creating systems to explore disruptive
4:14:32
opportunities right while sustaining your current business. Leadership buying right definitely required and then
4:14:39
ecosystem perspective. Consider how the status quo and disruption coexist within a ecosystem.
4:14:48
Evaluating impact of disruptive innovations. Now this one's a little interesting. Let's see. Okay. Evaluating
4:14:55
the impact involves analyzing a new technology, product or business model
4:15:00
affects ex how it affects existing markets, competitors, customersization
4:15:05
itself. Right? So the key dimensions are one market impact. I think that is uh
4:15:11
very well given. Right? Uh can it create new markets or expand the existing
4:15:17
market? Right? How will customer preferences shift due
4:15:22
to this innovation and how quickly the target market adopts to the disruptive
4:15:28
product? Then you have competitive impact. How will it impact the existing
4:15:34
competitors? Right? Uh what are the barriers to entry
4:15:39
for newer players? Right? And the redefinition of value which is essentially how this innovation change
4:15:47
changes what customers value in a product right. Uh so currently they might be let's say valuing price but
4:15:54
tomorrow you come up with a completely new version of it or something
4:15:59
absolutely different which does solves the same problem and then in that probably it is price higher but the
4:16:05
customer is now not looking at the price of it but actually let's say the value that it they are kind of generating from
4:16:13
it right then you have economic impact which is revenue shifts within the industry,
4:16:21
right? Potential revenue growth or loss, cost implications, evaluate cost efficiencies and then profit margin.
4:16:27
Analyze how the profit margins impact analyze the impact of on profit
4:16:32
margins for existing incumbents and disruptors. Then you have technology impact advancement of technology
4:16:38
determine if innovation introduces new technology standards or renders existing ones obsolete. Right? Scalability. How
4:16:46
easily the disruptive technology can scale. Right? How easy is it to scale? Then you have your organizational impact
4:16:54
uh business model evolution, right? How the innovation necessitates changes to
4:16:59
existing business models. Then you have your cultural shifts. Consider the internal cultural adaptations needed to
4:17:05
embrace or counter this disruption. And then you have operational adjustments. Whether the new innovation
4:17:12
will require new processes, skills or systems. And finally you have societal and regulatory impact. Right. Uh how the
4:17:19
innovation impacts societal norms, lifestyle and finally is the regulatory
4:17:26
considerations. How governments or industry bodies respond to innovation with new policies or regulation. So
4:17:33
these are the dimensions to evaluate or a new technology or let's say disruptive
4:17:39
innovation. I think you can use this
4:17:44
to kind of evaluate any idea. that you have right disruptive or even
4:17:50
non-disruptive. If you just look at all these different dimensions, this can be a good framework
4:17:56
to just evaluate any idea which is new product development process.
4:18:02
All right, overview of the new product development process, right?
4:18:08
Very simple just basic thinking. Whenever you kind of want to develop a
4:18:14
new product, what will you do? These are the steps right? You generate an idea. You screen these ideas right
4:18:22
and then you finally say okay this idea looks probably or this one and two idea look okay let me move forward further.
4:18:30
So next is concept development and testing right after that is market strategy and the whole analysis.
4:18:38
After that is the actual product development where it will let's say get
4:18:43
built then you test it again in the month then you do a final launch right I think with
4:18:52
any product business service I anything right this is what the process that is
4:18:58
normally and usually followed so if you once we start going into the
4:19:05
details of each of them right so idea generation I think is very easy to understand. Generate a pool of ideas,
4:19:10
right? Now, sources can be customer feedback, market research, competitors, let's say just internal brainstorming,
4:19:18
right? Uh external trends as well. So, you just kind of generate a lot of new
4:19:24
ideas. So, techniques are you do brainstorming sessions, right? You do focus groups or it you can also look at
4:19:31
let's say what is happening out in the outside world, right? look at what the new latest trends are, what is the
4:19:37
competitors doing and then kind of generate ideas from there. Then here's your idea screening process, right? Uh
4:19:45
evaluate these ideas, right? To identify the most feasible and promising ones. So
4:19:52
some factors to sort of look at the screening pieces that current alignment
4:19:57
with the goals, right? market potential, technical feasibility and cost
4:20:03
implications right so let's say as Shinasi said right they were in the water purifier and
4:20:09
water heater business right at that company right starts to think of
4:20:17
I don't know probably water bottles even though that idea can be a very good
4:20:23
idea of let's say selling water bottles but it does not align with their company
4:20:30
goal. So it doesn't make sense. So ideas can be great but when we are working for
4:20:35
a company it has to alignment with the business goals. This is something that I often see right
4:20:42
where in a lot of have a lot of ideas and this will come to you as well when
4:20:48
you know when then when you work as a product manager that you will get a lot
4:20:54
of random ideas from everywhere from sales, marketing, this that finance,
4:21:00
tech, everyone will throw a lot of ideas at you because you are essentially the idea guy at the company right every
4:21:09
Whatever idea your head you will actually let's say go into build.
4:21:15
So they will come and throw a lot of ideas and it is your prime
4:21:20
responsibility ideas though maybe they need to kind of
4:21:26
align with the company the business the product all of them and then kind of
4:21:33
saying no to them sounds a little easy and simple but unfortunately in
4:21:39
practical life it it is I think one of the most difficult uh
4:21:45
Right? Because a lot of time a lot of crazy ideas will come right from
4:21:51
right and then you will soon realize that this does not really
4:21:56
and saying no to let's say the CEO or the MD or whoever founder of the company
4:22:03
becomes a little tricky. So soft skill management that you will have to kind of
4:22:10
uh okay so third is your concept development and testing wherein you refine the idea to into a clear concept
4:22:17
and test it with potential customers. So define the product target market benefits features and then kind of
4:22:23
conduct surveys and focus groups to gather feedback. Fourth is business analysis, right? Uh assess the
4:22:30
commercial viability of the product, right? Market size, growth, competition,
4:22:36
right? How much revenue will you make? What is the profitability? When will you get let's say if you're if you're
4:22:42
looking at what is and then you go into product development where you transform
4:22:49
the concept into a physical or a digital product service, right? So you do a
4:22:55
prototype creation, you do a technical feing and then there's a whole collaboration between the design,
4:23:02
manufacturing if it's a physical product, right? To actually build once you're built, you will just do a
4:23:09
small let's say a small launch soft launch initially to test it in a let's say real world setting and to gather
4:23:16
feedback, right? So test market, you launch it in specific locations, you do a beta test, right? where you define
4:23:23
let's say a small group of users and you all out to them and then you can also
4:23:28
have your pilot program. So let's say a small scale release to validate. After that comes commercializing. So
4:23:35
this is your full-blown launch right you've kind of done your market testing
4:23:40
reports look good. Now you open it up to the entire world where now you will have
4:23:45
to develop your marketing and sales strategy. setup, distribution channel, launch promot and then finally is the
4:23:52
review of what is the product's performance right so we track let's say
4:23:57
sales profitability or different KPIs basis the product right customer
4:24:03
feedback the market share competitor response what is happening right so you just kind
4:24:10
of do a post-launch review so benefits is risk mitigation reduces the chances
4:24:15
of failure by systematically ly evaluating ideas, right? Customer centricity is ensures the product meets
4:24:24
market needs and expectations. Efficiency is obviously there, right? It streamlines the development efforts and
4:24:30
optimizes allocation of resources. And finally is innovation. It encourages creativity which is fine, right? Let's
4:24:38
say you screen the ideas, you do a concept testing where you talk to people, gather their feedback, right?
4:24:46
Even after doing this the new product can fail. So this is the example of the NPD
4:24:54
process right where they wanting to launch a smart fitness tracker right. So
4:25:00
scenario is a variable tech company plans to develop and launch a smart fitness tracker targeting health
4:25:06
conscious individuals who want to track physical activity, heart rate, sleep patterns
4:25:11
that we'll see let's say in actual what are the steps right idea generation source of ideas customer feedback
4:25:18
existing customers request a more comfortable stylish tracker with longer battery life market trends is increasing
4:25:25
customer interest in health and wellness competitor research is observation gaps
4:25:30
in computer products such as limited functionality or poor integration with mobile apps. Okay. Technology advances
4:25:38
new sensor technology that allows for more health monitoring. So these are their
4:25:44
sources of for their different ideas.
4:25:49
Now feasibility checkers evaluate the technical feasibility of integrating advanced sensors and optimizing battery
4:25:54
life. check market feasibility through surveys and focus groups and assess the financial viability. Now basis this
4:26:03
right they have selected is a smart fitness tracker with realtime heart rate monitoring sleep analysis step counting
4:26:09
and customizable watch faces. So that is what their selected idea is.
4:26:16
Now they've developed three concept concept one two three first is a fitness tracker with focus on heart rate
4:26:22
monitoring and fitness goal tracking. Second is a sleep tracking device with advanced algo. And third is a general
4:26:29
purpose fitness tracker with lightweight design and extended validator.
4:26:35
Customer testing. So prototype developed for concept three tested with a sample group to godge usability and appeal.
4:26:42
Feedback is a positive response to the design and lightweight feel. Need for
4:26:47
improved UI on the mobile app. Okay. Then they did their business analysis,
4:26:53
cost and pricing, development cost, projected unit cost, selling price, revenue forecast, profitability, right?
4:27:00
Gross profit margin, break even. So they're saying they'll achieve break even at 50,000 units,
4:27:06
which is and they're projecting sales of 100,000 units in the first year. So probably 6 months they should break
4:27:13
even. Okay. Now they come into the final the product
4:27:19
development stage. Where is design and prototyping? So they did a product design, finalize the design based on
4:27:26
customer feedback, work with engineering team to integrate health sensors, display technology and waterproofing,
4:27:32
develop multiple prototypes for use testing, user experience, variability and durability, iterative improvements
4:27:38
to address feedbacks. Then they go into market testing where they did a pilot launch. So limited
4:27:44
release in select markets collect feedback on user experience app integration and overall satisfaction and
4:27:50
then fine-tuning the marketing messaging right so market testing metrics is sales
4:27:57
data from the initial launch 500 units sold in two month customer feedback and review 90% positive
4:28:04
and now they come to the final step where they said okay now things are looking good 90% positive feedback so
4:28:12
then they'll do the final The prep of ensure production capacity meets demand. Secure retail partnerships. Finalize
4:28:19
online sales channels. Launch advertising campaign across social media influencers and fitness blogs.
4:28:27
Then they did a launch event. Post uh online launch event with live demonstrations.
4:28:34
And then post-launch evaluation is track product success, sales numbers, customer reviews, app
4:28:40
engagement. Right? So they they could see some early signs where in 10,000 units were sold within the first month
4:28:46
with high app engagement and then the continuous feedback loop is collect ongoing feedback from users and they do
4:28:53
iterative updates to the product app and firmware.
4:28:59
Okay. Identifying customer needs and market results. Right. But uh I think
4:29:05
this is something that breaks or makes 90% of the product. If we've kind of
4:29:12
figured this out, then a lot of things need to go wrong for the product to
4:29:18
fail, right? Uh and this is also I think the toughest
4:29:25
uh point here, right? So understanding customer need help helps in developing
4:29:32
products prioritizing feature ensuring transaction right all of that is fine
4:29:37
key questions to address what are the customers painoint or unmet needs how do customers currently address their needs
4:29:44
and what are the desired outcomes or a lot of times what also happens is
4:29:52
when customers are saying something right that is not the actual problem
4:30:00
the actual problem lies somewhere else right so let's say if I have a
4:30:08
it's Amazon okay and I start hearing that a lot of
4:30:15
my customers are facing delayed right there that the product is not reaching them
4:30:22
what can be the problem here okay So again this is a very hypothetical situation right?
4:30:30
It could simply also be that a lot of times
4:30:35
the customer I have is entering an incorrect address.
4:30:41
So when I'm when the customer is let's say entering the address they have to pin the address somewhere right and uh
4:30:50
because of the UX issue or the the UI UX issue on the app
4:30:58
the pin is getting mapped incorrectly because of which
4:31:04
the delivery partner is unable to figure out where the address is and the address is sort always the delivery
4:31:12
always gets delayed related issue. It's it's an app issue, right? It's a user journey issue or because the way we are
4:31:20
asking the customer to map the address and enter the address is not working out and that needs a
4:31:27
design issue. So it's not a bug or some some code that has gone.
4:31:33
So that could be the problem and since we now we figured multiple
4:31:39
ones so that I was essentially wanted to emphasize is identifying the actual pain point or the
4:31:47
issue. It says a lot of times data and people
4:31:52
will say something else but the real issue will lie somewhere else and that
4:31:57
is what our job as a product manager is to be able to kind of identify it and
4:32:03
the way to identify is to question everything right uh you start off at one
4:32:10
place and then you look at multiple facets so here there are technical
4:32:15
facets there is a you user experience facet there is definitely ly an operational delivery partner all of that
4:32:23
asset facet then there could be let's say al
4:32:28
regulatory as facet here right wherein let's say
4:32:34
there's some lockdown or some issue in a particular area because of which this
4:32:40
entire supply chain is is uh is getting mismanaged right
4:32:47
or some let's say political issue in some area because of which something is happening.
4:32:54
So when you look at all these multiple assets and then you essentially start
4:32:59
rejecting each one by one by looking at some more data and talking to some more people
4:33:05
okay this my code is fine does not look like a bug let's say user experiences is
4:33:10
fine there's nothing that has been changed let's say in the past one year so why suddenly this will happen that
4:33:16
cannot be attributed to this operationally okay what has happened on operationally what has changed recently
4:33:22
right or what is happening on ground could be I just moved to a new partner
4:33:27
right I changed my delivery partners in some area that could be a problem and
4:33:33
you essentially just do this and that is how you will be able to get very close
4:33:38
to let's say most of the times to the real pain point or the real problem of
4:33:44
yeah so good market research purpose and role I think all of us already understand
4:33:49
this is to gather data around customer demography preferences is competitors,
4:33:54
industry trends, right? Potential barriers to entry. That is what you do in market research.
4:34:02
Types of market is a primary where you directly collect data. Let's say a survey or a focus group. That is your
4:34:09
primary research. And then there is secondary research. Industry reports, competitor analysis, market studies,
4:34:15
right? Basically googling about all of this is also secondary.
4:34:20
Third is methods to identify customer needs. Right? You have two three methods
4:34:26
listed here. One is a qualitative method. Second is a quantitative method and third is co-creation with customers.
4:34:34
So qualitative measure method is where you use indepth understanding of
4:34:39
customer motivation very well. So essentially I think uh it is more about talking to these users and kind of
4:34:46
interacting with them directly where the quality of [Music]
4:34:52
the data is much right. So interviews, focus groups, ethnographic research,
4:34:59
right? Essentially observing customers in a real world setting. And then you have your quantitative methods where it
4:35:06
is surveys or questionaires that you will can ask customers to fill up. And looking at
4:35:12
let's say data analytics or let's say Google that is your quantitative co-creation
4:35:19
is very simple. We all I think we already did a bit of it earlier. Involving customers in the ideation
4:35:26
phase to start co-creating solutions. Right? Example given is engaging
4:35:32
frequent flyers in brainstorming for a new airline lawyer
4:35:38
tools is Google form for your survey analytics platform Google analytics mix
4:35:44
panel social listening tools. So brands, board watch, social sprout
4:35:49
do your give you data about customer sentiments online and then you have your competitor analysis. Seamra similar web
4:35:56
for understanding marketing market positioning steps to identify customer needs, define
4:36:03
the objectives, right? Segment the market, select
4:36:08
research methods, collect data, analyze and synthesize findings, prioritize
4:36:14
needs. So this framework
4:36:19
works I think more suitable when you're for a new development process right
4:36:27
uh phase but a lot of us
4:36:33
most of the time will not be building a new product we'll be essentially working on an existing product right so the
4:36:41
three or four methods facets that I kind of explained that would be much more used rather than
4:36:50
your new product development. But still this is what we are in which we starting we are starting new new product
4:36:55
development. So this is the steps. So product planning and feature
4:37:02
definition product vision product planning is the process of defining the goals mile right. So key components of
4:37:09
product is one product road map we'll cover the detail. Right? So this is a visual document outlining the timeline
4:37:16
for product development and delivery. It includes milestones, key features, dependencies, all of that. You have your
4:37:23
uh prioritization features, frameworks, right? We've already kind of understood this mos.
4:37:30
Then you have resource allocation and finally is your risk. So you can use tools like aa product and
4:37:39
then use your feature definition. Feature definition is the process of detailing specific functionalities and
4:37:46
right that the product will include to deliveration. Steps to define features are identify
4:37:52
user needs right use customer feedback market such an antics create user
4:37:57
stories write features in a user centric format as a user I want
4:38:03
right features we already know collaborate with teams and then document specifications is provide clear
4:38:10
functional and technical details basically when you're defining your
4:38:15
features the your first inst thing should be to
4:38:21
know who am I defining right who is going to read this is the let's say a
4:38:26
developer going to read this is the CEO going to read this read this right and
4:38:34
uh you can of add and subtract certain
4:38:40
details or go more more go into more details and change how you essentially write certain things because let's say
4:38:47
if I'm I'm writing a user a story right which is going for development then I
4:38:52
know it is essentially for my developer or my coder to to look at that story
4:38:58
understand what to code and then to code it right so it has to be in a language that he can connect
4:39:05
right uh it has to be very without having any ambiguous words right
4:39:13
so that he exactly can understand he or she can exact uh what needs
4:39:20
Balancing the feature set is avoid feature creep right and include a mix of
4:39:25
basic performance and innovative features to satisfy a broad users right
4:39:31
this is some when you're doing your planning right uh you can also phase it
4:39:37
out saying in phase one we'll just do let's say an MVP which will be very basic then in the phase two we'll add
4:39:44
some XYZ new performance and innovative related features
4:39:49
right? does not need that you know in every phase all these three types of
4:39:56
let's say even features there's a case study with this but I
4:40:03
don't think we right now have the time to do the case study
4:40:08
okay so a quick overview on the product vision document
4:40:14
so a product vision document is formalized or a representation of the product's long-term purpose and
4:40:20
strategy. All right. So this is the the template where you have an introduction which is a highle overview of the
4:40:26
product context brief description of why the product developed. Right. Uh second
4:40:32
is your vision statement. So a concise aspirational statement that encapsulates the product's purpose and future impact.
4:40:42
I think is self-explanatory definition of the primary users. segmentation based on demography, behavior, all of that. So
4:40:51
essentially who will be using the product or who is using this product. Then there comes the problem statement
4:40:57
explanation of the core problem or opportunity that the product address. Then you have your unique value
4:41:03
proposition description of what makes the right uh again very self-explanatory
4:41:10
goals and so short-term long-term objectives measurable outcomes to
4:41:15
evaluate success or whatever example is adoption rates revenue growth all these
4:41:20
name then is the market landscape so brief analysis of competitors industries
4:41:26
trend line the potential market right that this is where we are saying and
4:41:32
these are the different competitors. This is what their product is, right? Uh this is what as much as data as you can
4:41:40
should kind and then you have your key features. So let's say a highle description of the
4:41:47
core features. Strategic fit is how it how the product aligns with the company's mission, goals
4:41:53
and and portfolio. And final is the road map overview of visual textual online
4:42:00
outline of NIT. So this is these 10 things essentially are what
4:42:08
product vision document. So if you look at it and and if you
4:42:14
try to sort of build some resemblance to it, it also feels more like
4:42:21
right without a lot of the finance bit here. But let's say a very high level
4:42:27
business plan would in my head kind of consist of all the what are we doing who
4:42:34
are we building it for what is the problem what is the solution what who are the competitors what will this do
4:42:41
right what are if I look at from a very high level this is what essentially
4:42:48
any business plan will also have document if you look at this first line
4:42:53
right just the last sentence So this document serves as a foundation for stakeholders and teams to align
4:43:00
efforts throughout the product life cycle. Now we are in that product life
4:43:05
cycle stage where the product development is happening all of that is happening.
4:43:10
So if I go back to let's say the first this slide right I have started this
4:43:15
this phase. So all of this done, this is done, this is done, this is done, this is done, this done. Now I'm here, right?
4:43:23
And now let's say even even post this product development will still keep going, right? Product will let's say
4:43:29
keep evolving. So for that a firm understanding of what
4:43:36
is the product's vision, right? Because now a lot more people will just work on
4:43:41
product. So I as a product manager, right? Once let's say the business is defined
4:43:46
okay this is what we are doing all of that bit and once I start up then I
4:43:51
honestly do not care about the financial metrics and all of that bit now I only
4:43:57
where will this product go what will happen in the next two years with the product the business what will the
4:44:04
business happen is the business obviously I will keep engaging with them I have an understanding of it but just
4:44:11
from let's say a very specialization perspective I will only
4:44:16
okay this is my product vision and this is what I'm building. So any decisions
4:44:22
that I'll take tomorrow to add or subtract subtract from the product or
4:44:27
change the product need to be aligned to my product vision and where can I find
4:44:32
it? It I'll find it in this document. So that is the main purpose of this talk.
Product Management Interview Questions
4:44:38
In this interview questions video, we have organized the content into 10 different topics with two questions per
4:44:44
topic. This approach ensures we cover a wide range of areas that you might encounter during your product management
4:44:51
interview. So now let's look at the topics that we're going to cover during this video. We'll be starting with
4:44:56
product strategy and vision followed by market research and customer insights. Next we'll have product development life
4:45:02
cycle, go to market strategy or GTM strategy, stakeholder management, product metrics and KPIses or key
4:45:09
performance indexes, problem solving and critical thinking, user experience and design, leadership and team management.
4:45:16
Finally, we'll be wrapping this content up with business understanding. So let's jump into the first topic we're going to
4:45:23
cover in this particular video that is product strategy and vision.
4:45:29
The first question that we have on my list is how do you define and communicate a product vision to ensure
4:45:35
alignment across various teams. As a product manager, it's crucial to clearly
4:45:40
define your products's vision. That is putting your ideas into words that are able to communicate its purpose and its
4:45:47
vision to the rest of the team. And an even more important aspect is that the rest of your team is on the same page
4:45:54
with your idea. Now, the interviewer wants to check how you are able to do this. So you can break your answer down
4:46:00
into smaller points so that you're able to cover all these aspects. Start with the process followed by the
4:46:07
collaboration part, communication part, vision and execution and wrap it up with the feedback. How? Let's look. Start
4:46:14
with the process by clearly defining the steps you take to create and communicate the product vision. This will showcase
4:46:20
your systematic approach to product management. Next, talk about collaboration.
4:46:25
Highlight how you involve various stakeholders like the designing team, engineering team, marketing team, sales team, etc. in the process. Now, this
4:46:32
will show your ability to foster teamwork and collaboration across various departments. Once you have
4:46:38
defined the idea in the process stage, it obviously comes down to how you're going to involve the rest of the teams
4:46:44
with you in the process so that all of you can work towards a common goal. Next
4:46:49
comes a very important aspect, the communication. Naturally, you'll have both technical and nontechnical teams
4:46:55
working under you. So, as a product manager, it is up to you as to how you are able to define the same message to
4:47:01
both the different teams. This is where communication comes into play because strong communication skills will help
4:47:07
you to tailor your message according to your audience. Moving on, we have vision and execution. Now it's very common that
4:47:15
once you start executing the products's development life cycle, you might lose track of the initial vision of the
4:47:21
product. Now highlight to the interviewer that you can use certain strategies like product road maps or
4:47:26
performance metrics that will ensure that there is an alignment between the vision and the execution of the product.
4:47:33
Next we have feedbacks. Now this is again very crucial. If you are aware of agile methodology, you can highlight how
4:47:39
you create certain feedback loops that will allow your teams to voice their concerns or suggestions, ensuring that
4:47:46
the vision is always relevant and you're adaptive to changing circumstances. This
4:47:52
is to highlight to the interviewer that you are open to suggestions, but you are
4:47:57
capable enough to only accept the suggestions that will lead to the product being developed in such a way
4:48:03
that it caters to the business's goals and the overall products's vision. With this question, you can demonstrate to
4:48:10
the interviewer that you are open to suggestions, but you are capable enough to take only the suggestions which will
4:48:16
lead to the product being developed in such a way that it aligns with the business's goals, but it also caters to
4:48:23
the market needs at the same time. Now, let's look at the sample answer which caters to all the processes that I've
4:48:30
mentioned before. To define and communicate a product vision effectively, I start by gathering insights from customer needs, market
4:48:37
research, and company goals. This helps create a clear and compelling vision that answers the why behind the product,
4:48:44
ensuring it's aligned with both customer value and business objectives. Collaboration. I involve key
4:48:50
stakeholders early, including engineering, design, marketing, and sales team to ensure their input is
4:48:56
reflected and they feel a sense of ownership. Communication. When communicating the vision, I focus on
4:49:01
using simple, consistent messaging tailored for both technical and nontechnical teams, ensuring that
4:49:07
everyone understands and supports the decision. Vision and execution to maintain alignment. I link the vision to
4:49:14
day-to-day execution by incorporating it into the product road map so teams can see how their work contributes to the
4:49:21
larger goal. Feedback. Regular check-ins and updates keep the vision top of mind
4:49:27
while feedback loops provide opportunities to adapt the vision based on new insights or challenges. Let's
4:49:33
move on to the next question. Can you walk me through how you prioritize features on a product road map? With
4:49:39
this question, the interviewer is checking your commitment to understanding the customer's needs and
4:49:44
using those insights to make informed decisions. In today's fast-paced world,
4:49:49
priorities can shift quickly and the interviewer is assessing whether you can adapt to these changing circumstances
4:49:56
while keeping the product vision intact. Additionally, the interviewer might also be interested in checking your knowledge
4:50:02
of different frameworks and tools. Now, if you were to create a sample answer that incorporates all four of these
4:50:08
features, here's how it would look like. I gather inputs from cross functional stakeholders including engineering,
4:50:14
design and sales team to incorporate diverse perspectives and insights into the prioritization process. As for
4:50:20
prioritizing features on a product road map, I start by defining clear criteria such as customer impact, business value,
4:50:26
implementation effort and urgency ensuring decisions are made based on consistent metrics. Vision.
4:50:33
Additionally, I analyze customer feedback and data to identify critical pain points that needs addressing. Once
4:50:40
features are prioritized, I create a visual road map to communicate timelines and dependencies clearly to the team.
4:50:46
Frameworks and tools utilizing frameworks like rise that is reach impact confidence effort or Moscow must
4:50:53
have, should have, could have, won't have. I evaluate and rank the features based on their potential value and
4:50:58
feasibility. Moving on to the next topic, market research and customer insights.
4:51:05
How do you conduct market research to identify customer needs? We talked about
4:51:10
market research a lot, but there are certain frameworks that can help you conduct the right kind of market
4:51:16
analysis. Frameworks that can provide you with an outline with what you are looking for. With this question, the
4:51:22
interview is trying to figure out if you have the knowledge about such frameworks which will help you to figure out what
4:51:29
you need to look for. This question highlights how well you prioritize user feedback in product development. In
4:51:34
short, the interview is trying to understand how you find the data and how well you can use this data. There are
4:51:41
certain frameworks that will help you to accomplish this. Starting with the jobs to be done, which focuses on
4:51:47
understanding the specific tasks or jobs that customers are trying to accomplish in their lives. Next, you have the
4:51:53
design thinking framework, which is a human- centered approach to innovation that empathizes empathy and
4:51:59
understanding of the users's needs. So, now let's look at how you can utilize the jobs to be done framework. Start
4:52:06
with identifying the job or the need of the customer. You can start by conducting qualitative research such as
4:52:12
interviews or focus groups to understand the core job customers are trying to accomplish. Next, you can define these
4:52:19
job statements that can capture the functional, emotional and social dimensions of the job. For example, if
4:52:26
my job state, if my problem is that I want to eat healthier meals, but I have
4:52:31
limited time during the week, I can define the job statement as I want to cook healthy meals quickly because I
4:52:38
have limited time during the week. Next, you can segment them by jobs. that is
4:52:44
identify different customer segments based on the jobs they accomplish. Next, you can analyze the competitors that is
4:52:50
assess how existing products or services address these jobs and identify gaps where customer needs are not being met
4:52:57
so that your product can fill in these gaps. Next you have the design thinking
4:53:02
framework where it starts with empathizing with the users that is engaging with the customers through
4:53:08
interviews, observations and immersion to understand their experiences, feelings and pain points. Next, you can
4:53:15
define your product your problem statement. This statement should articulate the users's needs and the
4:53:21
context in which they arise. Next, you can ideulate a potential solution to the
4:53:26
problem. Brainstorm potential solutions to address the identified customer needs. Next, you can build a prototype.
4:53:33
Develop low-fidelity prototypes of the most promising ideas. Last but not least, conduct a test with the
4:53:40
prototypes to gather feedbacks. Now, if I were to incorporate this into a sample answer, here's how it would look like.
4:53:46
When conducting market research to identify customer needs, I utilize two primary frameworks. Jobs to be done and
4:53:52
design thinking. With the JTBD framework, I focus on understanding the specific tasks customers aim to
4:53:59
accomplish. This involves conducting interviews to uncover the jobs they need to complete and creating job statements
4:54:05
that define their desired outcome. I also assess competitors to identify gaps in the market where customer needs are
4:54:11
unmet. On the other hand, the design thinking frameworks allows me to adopt a human- centered approach. I begin by
4:54:18
empathizing with customers through observations and interviews, defining their needs and brainstorming potential
4:54:24
solutions. Prototyping and testing these ideas with user provide valuable feedback, enabling me to iterate and
4:54:31
refine solutions that align closely with customer expectations. By combining these frameworks, I ensure a
4:54:37
comprehensive understanding of customer needs and develop effective solutions that drive data. Now, let's look at the
4:54:44
next question. What methods do you use to gather and analyze user feedback?
4:54:49
This is a direct question intended to understand how much you know about different methodologies available in the
4:54:55
market. Again, this question also aims to understand your ability to analyze and interpret the meaningful data from a
4:55:02
pile of data. One important factor to consider here is that there are a lot of frameworks available in the market. All
4:55:08
of these although have the same intent, but use cases can vary significantly depending upon the situation. The
4:55:15
interviewer is evaluating your ability to select the correct framework according to your situation or how you
4:55:21
adjust certain pre-existing methods to fit exactly with your needs. So you can
4:55:26
start by mentioning a variety of methods for collecting feedbacks such as surveys, interviews, usability test,
4:55:33
customer support data, NPS or net promoter score, and social media listings. Show that you understand the
4:55:40
importance of both qualitative and quantitative feedback. Here's a sample answer. To gather and analyze customer
4:55:47
feedback, I employ a combination of surveys, interviews, and social media monitoring. Surveys are distributed
4:55:53
through email and online platforms to capture quantitative data, while one-on-one interviews provide
4:55:58
qualitative insights into customer experiences and preferences. Additionally, I analyze social media
4:56:04
channels to identify trends and sentiments regarding our product. Once the feedback is collected, I use data
4:56:10
analysis tools to identify patterns and themes, allowing me to make informed decisions that enhance customer
4:56:17
satisfaction and inform product improvements. This comprehensive approach ensures that we capture diverse
4:56:23
perspectives and respond effectively to customer needs. Moving on, we have the
4:56:28
product development life cycle with the first question. Can you explain the end-to-end product development process
4:56:35
and your role in it? The reason behind this question is to check your understanding of the entire products's
4:56:41
life cycle and to analyze your contributions within that process. You can start by outlining the complete
4:56:47
product development process from the idea generation to the post-launch part. Highlight your specific responsibilities
4:56:54
at each point. Here's a sample answer. The end-to-end product development process begins with identifying a
4:57:01
product need or a problem followed by conducting research to identify customer
4:57:06
requirements and market trends. As a product manager, my role is to define the product vision and strategy,
4:57:12
translating those insights into clear product requirements and creating a road map. I collaborate closely with cross
4:57:18
functional teams including design, engineering and marketing to ensure the product is developed according to
4:57:23
specifications and stays on track with the timeline. Throughout the development, I prioritize features,
4:57:29
manage the backlog and facilitate communication to keep all the teams aligned. Once the product is built, I
4:57:35
oversee the testing phase to ensure it meets quality standards and I coordinate the launch working with marketing and
4:57:41
sales to drive adoption. Post launch, I analyze customer feedback and product performance to identify areas for
4:57:48
improving, guiding iterative updates and future development cycles. Next, we
4:57:53
have, how do you determine when a product is ready for release or needs further iteration? With this question,
4:58:00
the interviewer is trying to assess your decision-making process in managing product quality and user satisfaction.
4:58:06
This will help the interviewer understand if you can deliver a product on time while ensuring it meets user
4:58:11
expectations and business objectives. While answering this question, make sure to mention predefined success criteras,
4:58:18
KPIs, and quality standards, demonstrating that you make your decision based on measurable outcomes,
4:58:24
highlighting that you are datadriven. Here's a sample answer. To determine
4:58:29
when a product is ready for release or requires further iteration, I rely on a combination of factors including meeting
4:58:36
the predefined success criteria, user testing results, and marketing readiness. First, I ensure that the
4:58:42
product has met all key performance indicators and aligns with the initial business goals. Additionally, I analyze
4:58:48
feedback from beta testing and user testing to identify any critical issues
4:58:53
or areas for improvement. If the product meets quality standards and there is no significant blockers, it's considered
4:59:00
ready for release. However, if testing reveals any major usability concerns or unmet customer needs, further iteration
4:59:07
may be necessary to ensure the product delivers optimal value to users. Ultimately, the decision is a balance
4:59:13
between delivering a highquality product and adhering to timelines. Moving on to the next topic that is the GTM strategy
4:59:20
or the go-to market strategy. Here's a question. What steps do you
4:59:25
take when planning a product launch? For these kind of questions, you can talk about the post-launch analysis
4:59:31
frameworks that you're aware of. And one such wonderful framework that we have in the market is the A3R3 funnel framework
4:59:37
or the pirate metrics framework which is awareness, acquisition, activation, retention, revenue and referral.
4:59:45
Starting with awareness. This is the stage where potential customers first become aware of your product or brand
4:59:51
through various marketing efforts. Where customers come to know that your product exists through your marketing efforts.
4:59:57
Now what do I mean by marketing efforts? You have social media such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter where
5:00:04
you can advertise about your product. Next you have content marketing where you can write blogs, articles, white
5:00:09
paper, infographics and videos. Next you have SE marketing or search engine optimization marketing where you can
5:00:16
display paid ads on Google and other search engines. Paid ads on Google are wonderful example. If I go to product
5:00:23
management course, if I do this then here are certain courses that are
5:00:28
sponsored by Google. This is what I mean by paid advertisement on Google. Coming back to our topic, we have display
5:00:34
advertising. Display advertising is basically the banners, videos and images that you see on different platforms
5:00:40
which can again bring users for your website. Next you have acquisition. This is a stage where you attract potential
5:00:47
customers and get them engaged with your products or services. This is the part where you focus on turning individuals
5:00:52
who are aware of your brand into visitors or leads by bringing them into your website app and store. Now there
5:00:58
are two sets of people. one who visit your website and immediately leave and the second who enter your website and
5:01:05
they start interacting with them. That is the acquisition stage where you make them interact with your website. And for
5:01:11
that you can have A and B testing which is the famous A and B testing which is basically testing out two or more
5:01:17
versions of your product to see which one works best with a certain group of users or with the generalized group of
5:01:24
users. Here you can experiment with different messaging visuals and landing pages to see which version is performing
5:01:31
the best and then whichever version was performing the best you can generalize it for the rest of the public. Then you
5:01:37
also have personalization which is tailoring the acquisition experience to different customer segments. Now this is
5:01:43
a very classic example. If I take let's take the example of Netflix. Now a person who's above 20s Netflix account
5:01:50
has a very high chance of being very different from a person who is over 30
5:01:56
years of age. So that is where the personalization factor comes in. A person below 20 years might like to
5:02:01
watch a certain kind of content and a person over 30 years might prefer watching a different type of content.
5:02:07
Next you have funnel optimization. This is basically minimizing the friction points in a user journey from clicking
5:02:13
an ad to becoming a lead. Say if you're displaying an advertisement, if you have a clothing store and you're displaying
5:02:19
on your advertising that you will get 50% off and then the user comes to your website and it turns out that that was
5:02:25
just a fake propaganda that was not there. You just did it so that the people will come. Don't do that. That is
5:02:31
the funnel optimization. Whatever you're displaying on the advertising, make sure to deliver it to your users as well.
5:02:38
Next, we have activation. The part where leads or new users are turned into active and engaged customers. The part
5:02:46
where your users actually start using your products on a daily basis to make sure that they continue using your
5:02:52
product. You can use email and inapp messaging. The best example I can think of right now is Zumato. The way they
5:02:59
keep on sending you notification throughout the day just to make sure that you're reminded that the app is
5:03:04
existing. A lot of users actually see these messages and the way they uh personalize the messages as well. A lot
5:03:11
of them are compelled just when they look at the message they're like okay now I should buy this because I saw this because the message was so personal that
5:03:17
you end up buying the product. That is email and inapp messaging sending welcome emails, product tips or
5:03:22
reminders to help users stay engaged and learn about important features. Next you
5:03:28
have personalized content that we've already talked about in Netflix's case. Then we have push notifications. again
5:03:33
notifications which are sent in order to remind users that the app exists and certain features also exist so that they
5:03:40
will keep on using the app for a longer duration. Next you have retention. Now
5:03:45
the prime focus of retention is so that the customers who once started using your product continue to use your
5:03:52
product or they keep coming back to use your product over a longer period of time. Now how to calculate retention?
5:03:59
You have churn rate which takes the percentage of users who stop using your product or cancel your subscription
5:04:05
after a certain period of time. Next, you have the customer lifetime value or also known as the CLTB, which measures
5:04:12
how much revenue a customer generates over the entire time they use your product. Now, this can be like if I
5:04:19
subscribe to Hot Star and I watch their content for a certain amount of time, then I'm then I lost interest and I
5:04:25
left. Then what was my subscription? which package did I bought? Or if we talk about Zomato, how much food did I
5:04:31
buy on Zomato? How much revenue could they make out of me? What was the profit they made out of me as a customer? That
5:04:37
is what CLTV means. Then you have cohort analysis. Now cohort means a group of
5:04:43
people. Uh you can take the example of say a group of people who started using your product from the January of 2025
5:04:50
which is yet to arrive and you can compare the users. How many people are using your services from January 2005 25
5:04:56
or how many people are using your services from November 2024? How how how
5:05:02
are their retention rates varying over time with the new features that you're updating? Which group of users are more
5:05:08
likely to stay on your website? How are different set of users interacting with your website. Next, you have engagement
5:05:14
metrics which can track how often a user is logging in and which feature they use
5:05:20
the most and how long they spend using your product. Such as if I am a user who's logging into Zomato, which kind of
5:05:27
food am I looking at? Which duration of the day am I more likely to log in? Do I pref do I prefer breakfast a lot? Do I
5:05:34
look for lunches a lot? Or do I am I looking for dinner or am I more interested in snacks? In that way, they
5:05:39
can personalize my uh feed also. Next you have revenue. This is the stage
5:05:45
where the retained users are converted into paying customers by and maximizing
5:05:50
the value they bring. A wonderful example of this is Hot Star where once
5:05:56
you start using their services uh you can initially watch shows there are for free but to watch their shows in maybe
5:06:04
in higher definition in HD or if uh some of the hot star originals you have to
5:06:09
pay them you have to subscribe and that is where you're generating the revenue from your users. So monetization
5:06:16
strategies, you can give a premium model. That's what I'm saying. You can just initially show them the free part
5:06:21
of your service and then show them that if you have premium, you will get all of these benefits as well. Next, you have
5:06:27
pricing strategies. You can provide them discounts or promotion. Value based pricing is depending on the demand. Uh
5:06:33
like say if Netflix decides to drop say Stranger Things season 5, they they're going to generate a huge amount of
5:06:40
people. the user base is going to drastically increase. Moving forward, we have upselling and cross-selling.
5:06:47
Upselling and cross-selling. The perfect example you can find is Hot Stars pricing model
5:06:54
there. This this is upselling and cross-selling where you are showing them three
5:07:01
different or more than this. Look at all the comparison and everything they're doing. This is basically upselling and
5:07:06
cross-selling. Coming back to our topic, encouraging users to buy more expensive
5:07:13
version of the product. Like if you have a normal one, go for full HD, full HD premium like that. Next, you have
5:07:20
customer lifetime value which we already talked about. And the final stage is the referral where the satisfied customers
5:07:27
are turned into advocates who promote your product or services to others driving organic growth through word of
5:07:33
mouth and referrals. A very good example of this will be if I buy a top from Misho and then I'll if I really like the
5:07:38
top I'll go to my friend and tell her also I bought this top from Misho I really like this you should also buy it and then she'll also go and buy that so
5:07:45
that is organic growth where they they Misho people didn't ask me to go and refer the top it was me who did it
5:07:51
because I really liked their product that is word of mouth that is referral now there can be other type of referral
5:07:57
as well like the reward for both parties the affiliate marketing the most famous one where say if there is a person if
5:08:04
there's a content creator and the content creator promotes a particular product on his or her website. Now if
5:08:11
another person buys this content creators is uh the whatever the content creator was advertising through the
5:08:17
content creators' link then the website itself through which the product the third person purchased will pay this
5:08:23
content creator as well. That is affiliate marketing a win-win situation. Next you have the net promoter score
5:08:29
which is used to identify your promoters and your demoters as well. Promoters are the customers who are likely to
5:08:36
recommend your product and demoters are the customers who are likely to badmouth your product. This will also lead to
5:08:41
your existing users stop using your services altogether. That's why this becomes important. Next you have word of
5:08:48
mouth which we already talked about in the Misho example. Then you have influencer referrals which is again that
5:08:53
content marketing content creator example I took where an influencer can act as an advocate and promote your
5:08:59
product to their audience as well. So from their audience itself you can maybe find a couple of people who will come
5:09:05
and purchase your products as well. So here's a sample answer. When planning a
5:09:11
product launch I begin by setting clear objectives and defining the target audience to ensure alignment with the
5:09:17
business goals. I then collaborate with cross functional teams including marketing, sales and customer support to
5:09:23
create a detailed launch plan that covers timelines, key messaging and promotional strategies. Next, I ensure
5:09:30
that all the product features are finalized and tested, gathering feedback from beta users to address any
5:09:36
lastminute issues. I also develop a go-to market strategy which includes pricing, distribution and communication
5:09:43
plans to generate buzz and attract early adopters. Finally, I coordinate
5:09:48
post-launch activities such as performance tracking, user feedback collection, and addressing any emerging
5:09:53
issues to ensure a smooth roll out and continuous improvement. Moving on to the
5:09:59
next question, how do you decide on the pricing strategy for a new product? While answering this question, the
5:10:04
interviewer checks whether you are analyzing the market, competition, and customer demand before setting the price
5:10:12
for a product. Also, are you considering the long-term strategy? As in, how would
5:10:17
you account for pricing flexibility, future discounts, and promotions? Here's a sample answer. When deciding on
5:10:23
pricing strategy for a new product, I start by conducting thorough market research to understand the competitive
5:10:29
landscape, target audience, and their willingness to pay. This includes analyzing competitors pricing models,
5:10:35
and identifying the product fits in the market. Next, I consider the products's value proposition by aligning the
5:10:42
pricing with the unique benefits it offers the customers. I use a value based pricing approach when possible,
5:10:49
ensuring the price reflects the products's perceived value. Additionally, I evaluate different
5:10:55
pricing models, whether it's a subscription, premium, or one-time purchase based on the nature of the
5:11:00
product and the customer journey. I also factor in the cost structure to ensure profitability and consider long-term
5:11:07
pricing flexibility such as potential discounts, promotion or tiered pricing. Ultimately, the goal is to balance
5:11:13
profitability with competitiveness while ensuring the price resonates with the target market and drive sustainable
5:11:20
growth. Moving on to the next topic, stakeholder management.
5:11:26
How do you manage conflicting priorities between different stakeholders? When
5:11:31
you're answering this question, the interview is mainly focused on your conflict resolution skills, as in how
5:11:36
you handle disagreements among stakeholders with different priorities or goals, your decision making, your
5:11:42
communication, your prioritization skills. When you're answering this question, don't deny the obvious.
5:11:48
Conflicts are very common when you're working in a team. If you have ever worked on a project in college with a
5:11:53
team where everybody was contributing equally, if that ever happened, you will know that conflicts are bound to happen.
5:12:00
So don't ignore that. Highlight the importance of prioritizing conflicts and the importance of clear and open
5:12:07
communication with everyone in the team including the stakeholders. Focus majorly on the outcome as in how your
5:12:14
approach can ensure alignment, resolve the existing conflicts and progress towards the overall project goals. Seal
5:12:21
your answer up with an example to leave the interviewer speechless. Now what kind of approach can you use? You can
5:12:27
use the canban framework where you can see that everything is splitted into
5:12:33
three sections backlog in progress and done. In this way, if you have unpredictable workload or need to focus
5:12:39
on ongoing task and maintenance, everything will be aligned and written and documented which is more likely to
5:12:47
reduce conflicts. Keep in mind that this is for an unpredictable workload and
5:12:53
also this can be a valuable tool for stakeholder management by providing transparency, enhancing communication
5:12:58
and aligning the overall expectation with the projects progress. Now like I said before this is for unpredictable
5:13:04
workload and this is when the work is not defined but if you need something more rigid and time bound then we have
5:13:12
the scrum framework. If you can see over here everything is divided according to the person which means it's more
5:13:18
structured and time box iteration to deliver new features or improvements incrementally. Keep in mind that both
5:13:23
scrum and canban are part of the agile methodologies and as a result both of
5:13:28
them have incremental approach. Now, Scrum framework fosters collaboration,
5:13:34
transparency, and continuous feedback through the development process. Here's a sample answer. Managing conflicting
5:13:40
priorities between stakeholders is a common challenge, but one that can be effectively handled through clear
5:13:46
communication and a structured approach. I start by ensuring that I fully understand each stakeholders's
5:13:52
objectives and concerns. Then I evaluate how their priorities align with broader
5:13:58
business goals, ensuring that we focus on what will deliver the most value for
5:14:03
the project as a whole. Open communication is the key. I hold discussions where stakeholders can voice
5:14:09
their needs and I help facilitate the communication by highlighting the impact of different priorities. For example, in
5:14:15
my previous role, I had to balance marketing's push for a faster product launch with engineerings's need for more
5:14:21
development time. By communicating the potential risk of rushing the product, and offering phased solutions, we were
5:14:28
able to reach an agreement that worked for both the teams. Ultimately, my approach ensures that we maintain
5:14:33
alignment, make informed decisions, and move forward with clarity.
5:14:38
Moving forward, let's have our next question. Can you share an example of how you have collaborated with crossf
5:14:44
functional team? Now if you give example based answers, you can expect these kind of questions where they'll directly ask
5:14:51
you to give a direct answer with an example. The ultimate end goal of the interviewer here is to check if you're
5:14:57
capable of facilitating teamwork and cooperating in a way that enhances a project's success. You just talked about
5:15:04
how you can incorporate various frameworks to resolve the conflicts. Now they're asking an example of where you
5:15:12
have done this. Here the interviewer is trying to look for the collaboration. How well you work with people from
5:15:17
different functions. Your problem solving skills. How you leverage the strengths of various departments to solve complicated problems or achieve a
5:15:24
common goal. Then you have coordination. Your ability to communicate goals and coordinate actions across various teams.
5:15:31
Then your leadership and influence as in whether you can influence and align teams with different priorities towards
5:15:36
a shared outcomes. So here's a sample answer. In my previous role, I collaborated with a cross functional
5:15:43
team to launch a new product feature. The team consisted of engineers, designers, and marketing professionals,
5:15:49
each with their own goals and perspectives. Our goal was to develop and promote a feature that met technical
5:15:55
standards while also appealing to our target market. I facilitated regular meetings where each department could
5:16:01
provide updates and I made sure that the communication remained transparent and focused by fostering an open dialogue. I
5:16:08
helped align the team on key priorities such as balancing design aesthetics with technical feasibility. For example, when
5:16:15
marketing wanted a visually complex UI, I worked with design and engineering to find a solution that balanced user
5:16:22
appeal with development efficiency. The project was successful, delivered on time and the feature was wellreceived by
5:16:28
the customers showing how cross functional collaboration can drive impactful results.
5:16:34
Moving on to the next topic, product metrics and key performance indexes. We
5:16:39
have what key metrics do you track to measure the success of a product? Now, before moving on to the sample answer,
5:16:46
let's look at the key metrics that you're going to use to measure the success of a product. Starting with
5:16:51
customer lifetime value, which is like we have already discussed before. It's a metric used to estimate the total
5:16:57
revenue a business can expect from a customer over the entire duration of their relationship. Now, why is this
5:17:03
important? It helps decide how much to spend on acquiring new customers. If your existing customers are paying you
5:17:10
well enough, then you might not be requiring new customers right now. Then it identifies highv value customers for
5:17:16
targeted marketing. encourages focusing on customer retention as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than
5:17:23
the retaining ones which I discussed right here. Now there's a formula for measuring this as well which is the
5:17:29
customer value into customer lifespan into profit margin. Now what's the customer value? Customer value is the
5:17:35
average purchase value multiplied by purchase frequency. Lifespan is how long a customer typically stays with the
5:17:41
business. Profit margin is to account for the cost involved in acquiring and serving the customers. Next, you have
5:17:47
the customer acquisition cost, which is a metric that measures the cost associated with acquiring a new
5:17:54
customer. Now, it's important because it helps businesses allocate their marketing and sales budget effectively.
5:18:01
When compared to CLTV, it helps determine if the business is spending effectively to acquiring customers. High
5:18:09
CAC might indicate inefficiencies or the need for better targeting in marketing campaigns. Now, customer acquisition
5:18:15
cost can point out the inefficiencies you have in your marketing campaigns and
5:18:20
it can better your marketing campaigns. Again, there's a formula for this as well, which is the total sales and
5:18:26
marketing expense divided by number of customers acquired. Here, the sales and marketing expense includes all the costs
5:18:32
associated with campaigns, tools, and salaries. And the number of customers acquired is the total number of new customers which you acquired during the
5:18:39
same period in which you created this marketing. Next, you have the costs per lead, which is a marketing metric that
5:18:45
measures the cost associated with acquiring a new lead, which is a potential customer who has shown
5:18:52
interest in a company's products or services. Now, this is important because this helps assess the effectiveness of
5:18:58
different marketing channels and campaigns. Assists in optimizing marketing budgets by identifying which
5:19:04
channels provide the best return on investment. can indicate the quality of leads generated as a lower CPL might not
5:19:10
always correlate with higher conversion rates. The formula is total marketing expense divided by the number of leads
5:19:17
generated. Total marketing expense here is the cost related to campaigns, advertising and promotional efforts
5:19:22
aimed at generating leads. And the number of leads generated is the total number of leads acquired during a
5:19:28
specific period. Next, you have the bounce rate. This I even talked about earlier when there are two sets of
5:19:34
users. Once who come and uh once you visit your website and then just directly leave who leave a website after
5:19:40
viewing only one web page without interacting further and the second set who actually interact with your uh
5:19:46
website. The importance here is that a higher bounce rate means that the visitors who are visiting your website
5:19:52
they are not able to find what they expected or the content isn't engaging enough. It helps assess the
5:19:58
effectiveness of landing pages and the overall content strategy. Search engines may interpret a higher bounce rate as a
5:20:05
sign that the site isn't providing valuable information potentially affecting search rankings. The formula
5:20:11
for bounce rate is single page visits divided by total visits whole multiplied by 100. The key elements is that the
5:20:18
single page visits refers to visitors who enter the site and exit without clicking on any other pages. Total
5:20:24
visits is a total number of entries to the website during a specific period. Next, you have the churn rate which
5:20:30
measures the percentage of customers or subscribers who discontinue their relationship with the business over a
5:20:36
specific period of time. Now, a high churn rate indicates problems with customer satisfaction or engagement. A
5:20:43
higher churn rate means that there's something wrong with your retention rate. This highlights areas needing improvement. Understanding churns helps
5:20:51
predict future revenue and make informed decisions about budgeting and resource allocation. Reducing churn is essential
5:20:58
for sustainable growth as retaining existing customers is generally less expensive than acquiring the new ones.
5:21:05
The formula for calculating churn rate is number of customers lost divided by the total number of customers at the start. Number of customers lost is the
5:21:12
total number of customers who left during the period. Total number of customers at the start is the total number of customers at the beginning of
5:21:17
the period. Last, we have the net promoter score which measures the customer loyalty and satisfaction by
5:21:24
assessing the likelihood of customers recommending a company's product or services to others. Now, the importance
5:21:30
is that NPS is a strong indicator of customer loyalty and overall satisfaction. Your word of mouth
5:21:36
referral can also in increase if you have a higher NPS score. It allows companies to compare their performance
5:21:41
against industry standards or competitors. NPS surveys often include open-ended questions providing
5:21:48
qualitative feedback that can be used to enhance products and services. Now, NPS
5:21:53
score is calculated by the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors. I'm sure you must have heard
5:21:58
of the survey questions where they ask you to rate the user experience from 0 to 10. There are promoters who are loyal
5:22:05
customers who are likely to recommend and contri and contribute positively to the growth. Then there are passives who
5:22:11
are satisfied but they won't recommend it to other people. Then there are detractors who are the unhappy customers
5:22:17
who can in turn harm the brand through the negative word of mouth. Here's a
5:22:22
sample answer. To measure product success, I track several key metrics that provide insights into customer
5:22:28
engagement and financial performance. CLTV helps me understand expected revenue from a customer over their
5:22:34
relationship with us, guiding acquisition and retention strategies. I monitor customer acquisition cost to
5:22:39
evaluate marketing efficiency and ensure spending aligns with revenue goals. Cost per leads assesses lead generation
5:22:46
effectiveness while bounce rate indicates user engagement on our website. Additionally, I keep an eye on
5:22:52
churn rate to understand the customer retention and NPS for insights into customer loyalty and satisfaction.
5:22:58
Analyzing these metrics collectively allows me to make datadriven decisions that drive growth and enhance customer
5:23:04
satisfaction. Moving on, we have the next question which is how do you use data to make informed product decisions?
5:23:11
Now, this question is also asked to assess your ability to leverage datadriven insights for product
5:23:16
management. It is basically to test whether you make objective evidence-based decisions rather than
5:23:22
relying solely on your initial assumptions or your intuitions. Here's a sample answer. Using data to make
5:23:29
informed product decisions is essential to ensure we are solving the right problem and delivering value to the
5:23:35
users. I typically start by gathering both quantitative data such as user behavior metrics and qualitative
5:23:41
insights like customer feedback. For example, I analyze user engagement data to identify patterns in feature usage
5:23:48
which helps pinpoint which feature are underutilized and why. I also conduct A&B testing to assess how different
5:23:55
product changes affect user experience and conversion rates. One time we noticed a huge drop off rate during the
5:24:02
onboarding process. By analyzing user flow, I discovered that a certain step was confusing. We simplified that step
5:24:09
and after implementing the change saw a 20% increase in user retention. This
5:24:14
datadriven approach ensures that we continuously optimize the product based on real user behavior and feedback
5:24:21
leading to better outcome and alignment with the overall business goals. Moving
5:24:26
on to our next topic, problem solving and critical thinking. How would you approach improving a product that has
5:24:32
been underperforming? Now this question along with checking your analytical thinking also checks your willingness to
5:24:40
test, iterate and refine your solution based on new information and metrics. In
5:24:46
the beginning you had said certain strategies but unfortunately that didn't work and your product was
5:24:52
underperforming. So are you as a product manager willing to change and redefine
5:24:58
your solution in order to help this product get better? testing if you can develop a structured approach to turn
5:25:04
around an underperforming product while aligning to the business requirements and customer needs. Here's a sample
5:25:11
answer. When approaching an underperforming product, I start by analyzing data and gathering customer
5:25:16
feedback to identify the root cause. I would look at metrics such as user engagement, churn rates, and customer
5:25:23
satisfaction to see where the product is falling short. Additionally, I'd collect qualitative feedback from customers and
5:25:30
internal teams to better understand pain points. Once I have a clear understanding of the issue, I prioritize
5:25:36
the most critical areas to focus on whether that's improving the user experience, addressing technical issues,
5:25:42
or adjusting the product market fit. I would work closely with crossf functional teams to implement changes in
5:25:48
small testable iterations such as running A&B test or launching MVPs of new features. After implementation, I
5:25:56
would monitor the impact of these changes by tracking key metrics to ensure that the product is back on
5:26:01
track. This approach helps ensure we are addressing the right problems and continuously improving the product. Next
5:26:08
question, can you describe a time when you solved a challenging product issue? How did you approach it? Now, this
5:26:15
question again checks your problem solving, your decision- making, and how you handle complicated situations. It's
5:26:22
an example based question where you'll have to provide an example. Now when you're providing an example, make sure to break it down into certain steps
5:26:29
starting with set the context. Describe how you identified the problem and the
5:26:34
steps you took to solve it. Next, explain your approach. Emphasize on how
5:26:40
you identified the problem and the steps you took to solve it. In the setting the context part, we identified the problem.
5:26:46
In the explaining your approach, focus on the steps that you took after you identified the problem. Next, highlight
5:26:52
the solution. Now you identified the problem. Now you need a solution. Share the solution you implemented and any
5:26:59
other iterations along the way. Obviously, it's not a one-sizefits-all kind of approach. So even if you provide one solution, there is a chance there's
5:27:06
a very high chance that that one solution might create another problem. So explain the whole path to the
5:27:12
interviewer. Next, emphasize the outcome. Describe the positive impact your solution had on the overall product
5:27:20
and the business itself. Here's a sample answer. At one point, we faced a
5:27:25
significant drop in user engagement for a key feature of our product. The feature was crucial for retention. So,
5:27:32
solving this issue was a top priority. I began by analyzing usage data to
5:27:37
identify when and where users were disengaging. I also conducted customer interviews to understand their pain
5:27:44
points which revealed that the feature was too complex and not intuitive. After gathering insights, I collaborated with
5:27:51
the UX and the engineering teams to simplify the user interface and streamline the workflow. We rolled out
5:27:56
these changes in phases, conducting A and B testing at each step to measure the impact. As a result, engagement with
5:28:03
the feature increased by 30% and customer satisfaction improved significantly. This approach not only
5:28:10
solved the immediate issue but also provided us with a framework for handling similar challenges in the
5:28:15
future. Moving on to the next topic user experience and design. We have our first
5:28:21
question. How do you ensure that the user experience is prioritized in product development? Now with this
5:28:27
question the user is trying to check your mindset that if you have a user centric mindset whether you keep the end
5:28:34
user at the center of the product development process then your integration of UX principles how you
5:28:40
incorporate user experience research feedback and design principles into product designs. Next are you able to
5:28:48
balance business and user needs your ability to balance business goals with the need for an intuitive and satisfying
5:28:55
user experience. Next, your collaboration. How you work with designers, engineers, and researchers to
5:29:00
ensure your uh user interface is not overlooked or depprioritized. Next, the
5:29:06
your use of data and feedbacks. Your process for using data, testing, and user feedback to validate UX decisions
5:29:13
throughout the development process. Here's a sample answer. Prioritizing the user experience is essential for
5:29:19
creating a product that resonates with customers and drives engagement. To ensure UX is always front and center, I
5:29:26
start by collaborating closely with UX UI designers and researchers. Early in
5:29:32
the development process, we conduct user research, including interviews and usability testing to understand pain
5:29:38
points and gather insights into how users interact with the product. I make it a point to involve cross functional
5:29:45
teams in these discussions so that everyone understands the importance of user experience. We also rely heavily on
5:29:52
data using A&B testing, heat maps and user analytics to validate design choices and ensure that any changes are
5:29:59
positively impacting the user experience. Throughout the development, I strive to balance user needs with
5:30:05
business goals, ensuring that while we are driving business outcomes, we never compromise on delivering a seamless and
5:30:12
intuitive experience for our users. Next question. How do you collaborate with design teams to build user-friendly
5:30:19
products? With this question, the interview is trying to check that now that you have the data, how are you going to use the data? Here's a sample
5:30:26
answer. Collaborating with design teams is essential for building user-friendly products. And I approach this
5:30:31
collaboration with the focus on open communication and shared goals. I believe in starting the design process
5:30:38
by aligning on the user needs and project objectives, often bringing insights from user research to the
5:30:44
table. Throughout the development cycle, I facilitate regular check-ins and brainstorming sessions to ensure that
5:30:50
we're on the same page and that design decisions are informed by both user feedback and technical feasibility. For
5:30:56
instance, in a recent project, we identified through user testing that users were struggling with the
5:31:02
navigation of our app. By working closely with the design team, we iterated on the navigation structure,
5:31:08
creating a more intuitive layout that improved usability. This collaboration not only enhanced the user experience,
5:31:15
but also increased user engagements significantly, showcasing the value of strong partnerships between product and
5:31:22
design teams. Moving on, we have leadership and team management. How do
5:31:27
you motivate your team during challenging product development phases? Well, with this question, the
5:31:33
interviewer is trying to check your leadership style, your approach to leading and inspiring a team, particularly in high pressure situation.
5:31:41
Next, you have your team dynamics. How well you recognize emotional and motivational needs of team members
5:31:47
during challenging times. Next, your problem solving ability to identify challenges that affect team morale and
5:31:53
how you address them. Next, your communication skills as in how effectively you communicate with your
5:31:59
team to keep them focused and engaged. Next, your adaptability. Your capability
5:32:04
to adjust your motivational strategies based on the unique needs of the team and the specific challenges faced.
5:32:10
Here's a sample answer. Motivating a team during challenging product development phase is critical for
5:32:15
maintaining momentum and achieving our goals. I believe in creating a supportive environment where team
5:32:21
members feel valued and heard during tough times. I focus on open communication, encouraging team members
5:32:27
to voice their concerns and share their ideas. Setting clear achievable goals also helps the team see progress even
5:32:35
when faced with obstacles. For instance, during a recent project, we encountered significant delays due to unforeseen
5:32:41
technical challenges. I organized regular check-ins to discuss our progress, celebrate small wins, and
5:32:47
adjust our strategy as needed. I also made it a point to recognize individual contributions which helped boost the
5:32:54
overall morale. As a result, the team remained engaged and focused, and we successfully delivered the product on
5:33:00
time. This experiment reinforced the importance of fostering a collaborative and motivating environment, especially
5:33:06
during difficult phases. Moving on. Can you give an example of a time when you had to make a tough leadership decision?
5:33:13
Again, you have to give an example. I faced a tough leadership decision once when our team was working on a product
5:33:19
launch that was crucial for our company's growth. As we approached the deadline, it became clear that a key
5:33:25
feature was not performing as expected during the test. I had to decide whether to delay the launch to fix the issue or
5:33:33
go ahead as planned and address the problem post launch. After discussing the implications with the team, I
5:33:38
evaluated our options carefully, considering user expectations, potential revenue impact, and the technical
5:33:44
feasibility of fixing the issue in time. Ultimately, I decided to delay the launch for a few weeks to ensure we
5:33:50
delivered a high quality product. While this decision was difficult, it was crucial to uphold our commitment to user
5:33:57
satisfaction. After the launch, we received positive feedback from the users about the feature, validating our
5:34:03
decision further. This experience taught me the importance of prioritizing quality and the long-term impact of
5:34:10
leadership decisions. Moving forward to our last topic, business understanding.
5:34:15
The first question we have, how do you ensure that the product decisions align with the overall business goals? With
5:34:22
this question, the interview is checking your emotional intelligence as in your ability to consider the impact of your
5:34:28
decisions on team dynamics and individual team members. Next, your responsibility and your accountability
5:34:35
as in your willingness to take ownership of difficult choices and their outcomes.
5:34:40
Followed by your critical thinking, as in how you handle challenges and uncertaintities in a leadership role.
5:34:46
Next, your problem solving as in your ability to analyze the situation and weigh options to make informed
5:34:53
decisions. Here's a sample answer. To ensure that product decisions align with the overall business goals, it's
5:34:59
essential to start by thoroughly understanding the company's vision, mission, and strategic objectives. This
5:35:04
involves continuous communication with key stakeholders, including leadership, sales, marketing, and customer support
5:35:11
to gain insights into their perspectives and priorities. By setting clear product goals that map directly to these
5:35:17
business objectives, each decision can be evaluated from its potential impact on revenue, customer satisfaction,
5:35:23
market positioning or other key metrics. Regularly reviewing product performance against these goals and being open to
5:35:30
iterative adjustments ensure that the product remains aligned with the broader business strategy while adopting to
5:35:36
market changes. Next question, how do you analyze the financial impact of a product design? With this question, the
5:35:43
interviewer is trying to check your financial literacy as in your knowledge of key financial metrics such as profit
5:35:49
margins, ROI, costs, and revenue. Next, your strategic thinking, as in whether
5:35:54
you can connect product decision with their long-term financial impact on the company. Your risk assessment, how you
5:36:01
assess financial risks and opportunities when making product decisions. your analytical abilities as in your process
5:36:07
for evaluating financial trade-offs and potential outcomes of different product decisions. Then your decision- making as
5:36:14
in how you balance financial considerations with user needs and product strategy. Here's a sample
5:36:19
answer. When making product decision, analyzing the financial impact is essential to ensure that we align with
5:36:25
business goals. I typically start by looking at key financial metrics such as profit margins, ROI, and customer
5:36:32
acquisition costs. For example, if we're deciding whether to launch a new feature, I first evaluate the
5:36:37
development and operational costs associated with it, then I project the potential revenue it might generate by
5:36:44
analyzing market demand, customer willingness to pay, and by associated risks. In one instance, we considered
5:36:50
developing a premium feature that required significant resources. By calculating the expected ROI and
5:36:56
comparing it to the projected increase in user subscriptions, we determined that the feature would significantly
5:37:02
boost profit margins over time. This financial analysis has helped us confidently move forward with the
5:37:08
decision, ensuring that it does not only improve user experience but also had a positive impact on the bottom line.
5:37:15
That's all for this video. Thank you so much for watching.

What is Product Management?
3:47
it's not a straightforward path but it's definitely rewarding over the last two decades there's been a lot of Buzz
3:53
around product psychology think back to the early 1900s when industrialization
3:59
was just starting the challenges back then were basic things like Transportation communication and
4:05
utilities a few companies stepped in to solve these problems and because the market wasn't too competitive just
4:12
providing a functional solution was often enough to succeed but as we evolved so did our needs and
4:18
expectations the business World grew rapidly and with that came intense competition companies weren't just
4:25
solving basic problems anymore they were competing to meet more sophisticated consumer demands products needed to be
4:32
user friendly Innovative and aligned with what customers wanted this shift made product management crucial as
4:39
markets became crowded and consumers became more Discerning product managers ensure that products not only worked but
4:46
also resonated with users it's about figuring out what customers really want and make sure your product meets those
4:53
needs let us look at one such amazing case study Ben Silverman an ex Google
4:58
customer support developer created an app called tot in 2009 which was described as catalog for the phone his
5:06
aim was to transform every cell phone into a clothing retail outlet with this one app toad connected consumers with
5:12
dozens of retailers and allowed its users to catalog their favorite items tot would then send out an alert to the
5:19
users whenever any of the cataloged items was on sale so that they could make a purchase however the outcome
5:27
turned out to be a little different than what Ben expected the users instead of making purchases
5:32
through the app used it to share the collections with each other but Ben did not look at it as a setback rather he
5:38
recalled how he collected insects as a kid and loved sharing his collection with others he thought of implementing
5:44
something like this in to as well and just like that Pinterest was born and became a very big hit very quickly for
5:51
one main reason it allows users to pin whatever they're interested in and add it to their Personal Collection the way
5:58
users actually wanted the app to function interesting right now let us understand what a product is a product
6:05
can be just an idea that can be presented to the society or market for example let's go back to the 4,000 BCE
6:13
when the concept of the wheel came into existence it reshaped the entire way people looked at transport and solv the
6:19
issue of carrying heavy goods from one place to another or look at the good and works printing press which transform the
6:26
entire mode of communication or a product can be an item like the shampoo fruits vegetables
6:32
Electronics clothes and hundreds of other Goods available in the market last category of a product is in the form of
6:38
a service be at your food delivery or a haircut you get at the saloon it all comes under Services even the
6:44
applications on your devices are all services now that we know the clear definition of a product let us
6:51
understand product management product management deals with multiple fields in a business and it is quite difficult to
6:58
come up with a definition for product management at the very core product management is something that is needed
7:04
to meet the gap between what the customer wants and what is technically and operationally possible product
7:11
management helps to discover a product that is valuable usable and feasible Martin Ericson founder of
7:18
product tank defined product management as the intersection between functions of business technology and user experience
7:26
he further stated that a good product manager must be experiencing in at least one and passionate about all three in
7:33
order to build the right product and build the product right product management can be mainly categorized
7:39
into three steps or phases first is product strategy which is just thinking
7:44
about what to build here is where the customers need and demand is considered so that the product is successful and
7:50
generates Revenue next comes the development phase where the product is brought to life and then finally the
7:57
marketing of the product which is very Cru as it deals with how to promote and sell the product so in a nutshell
8:04
product management is an aspect that ensures that the customer gets the desired product or the outcome that was
8:10
asked by him or her while also keeping in mind the business goals and objectives for what a product manager
8:16
does based on the organization size specific responsibilities of a product
8:21
manager differ for instance in larger organizations product managers often
8:26
have the support of various teams like marketing engineering design and sales to help bring a product to life however
8:34
with more help comes the challenge of ensuring everyone is on the same page hence in such cases the product managers
8:41
spend more time aligning these stakeholders behind a specific Vision but when it comes to a small
8:48
organization a product manager is required to do more of the Hands-On work that comes while defining the vision let
8:55
us take a closer look at the roles and responsibilities of a product manager by taking an example of a fitness app the
9:02
core of product management is understanding the end users their challenges goals and preferences when it
9:08
comes to managing their fitness routines say the product manager figures out that users want personalized workout plans
9:16
next you analyze the current market examine popular fitness apps to understand what features they offer the
9:22
pricing models and user reviews and notice that competitors lack detailed nutrition tracking a gap that could be
9:28
filled keeping this in mind you define the product Vision an app that combines
9:33
personalized workout and nutrition something that aligns with your company's goals and also fills the
9:39
market Gap basically answering the question what are we building and why
9:44
next the product manager aligns stakeholders from Engineers to marketing and even sales around this vision and
9:52
ensures everyone understands the goal to keep the project on track a product manager prioritizes features deciding
9:59
that personalized workouts are a must have for the first release while Advanced Nutrition tracking will come
10:05
later on once the product which is the app in our case is built tested and
10:10
released in the marketplace the performance of the product is constantly monitored and the feedback is collected
10:17
and implemented in the next release after the discussion with the concerned parties now that we know the major roles
10:24
and responsibilities of a product manager let us see the different types of product managers in an or
10:29
organization digital product managers Drive the strategy for web- based products they focus on creating seamless
10:36
user experiences product marketing managers usually have a strong background in
10:42
marketing as they delve deeper into market research ensuring products resonate with Target customers and they
10:48
Implement goto Market or the GTM plans growth product managers specialize in
10:55
amplifying business expansion by harnessing product features as sales tools
11:00
this job role is for someone who is intrigued by the idea of scaling Business technical product manager is
11:06
someone who has a technical background and even though his or her job role is similar to that of a generic product
11:12
manager a technical product manager is able to contribute more to the engineering team and in the Hands-On
11:18
part of the projects data product manager focuses on data collection processing and Analysis
11:25
to support decision making within the company before we Di dive into the theoretical aspects of product
11:31
management let us look at some frequently used key terms the first term we have is MVP which stands for minimum
11:38
viable product it is the simplest version of a product that you need to build to sell it to a market with the
11:45
least amount of risk in investment the goal is to validate the product concept and learn from real users before
11:52
investing in a full scale launch next is MBI or minimum business increment this
11:59
focuses on delivering the smallest feature updates or improvements in the product that positively impact the
12:05
business rather than releasing all the features at once and then we talk about MMF or minimum marketable feature we're
12:13
referring to the smallest chunk of functionality in a product that delivers real value to users and can actually be
12:19
marketed or sold it's a feature that's fully developed and ready to be released on its own and lastly we have the MMR
12:27
minimum marketable release which is essentially the smallest version of a product that's ready to hit the market
12:34
it's more robust than an MVP or MMF aiming to meet Market needs right away while leaving room future improvements I
12:41
hope you guys are clear with what product management is and the work scope of a product manager moving on we will
12:47

name so overall what we are going to learn is what what is the meaning of product what are the different types of
13:40
product what is the meaning of product management how product management as a profile evolved over a period of time
13:47
next point is hierarchy and product management domain uh number five why product management you know why why
13:53

14:02
understand product management roles and responsibilities uh we'll understand what are the skills required to become a
14:08
product manager uh there are a lot of questions you know people are not very clear about
14:14
what is the difference in roles and responsibilities of product manager versus project manager versus program
14:19
manager uh so detailed I have a couple of slides which explains the differences in the roles and
14:25
responsibilities okay then we will try to cover service product management so I just want to highlight here that product
14:31
management is not specific which is product based companies but we have these kind of roles in service based organizations also so that I will cover
14:39
product management in service based Industries uh as we know we will come to
14:44
know we will discuss basically product manager will work with multiple cross functional teams so I would like to give
14:51
you a brief idea about which are all those cross functional teams and what is their roles and responsibilities so you are crisp and clear basically what
14:58
product manager do who does what other other other functions supposed to do uh
15:03
11 we'll try to understand what are the best practices in product management uh 13 we will have detail slide on what are
15:09
the different tools product manager we will be using in day-to-day operations
15:14
uh we will not go in detail today we'll just try to understand uh the tool names and its application however in the
15:20
respective module uh we will have hands-on experience for those tools and last I created one case study about uh
15:27
how product managers try growth in Tech startup first one what is product and its type what is the definition of
15:34
product product is anything that can be offered to Market to satisfy uh customer want customer need it could be a
What is a Product and its Types?
15:41
physical item it could be a service it could be a digital solution created for consumer or business so overall in a
15:48
product your service is also kind of product your service okay we have service in separate industry but in
15:53
overall definition of a product is basically something which we are going to offer to the market to satisfy y a
15:59
customer need or customer want and again the types of products you have physical products where you know it is tangible
16:05
you can see you can touch you can fill such as you Electronics Furniture food
16:10
clothing you know smartphone cars home appliances there is another category of product which call which call it as a
16:16
service Services basically these are intangible offerings that provide value through experience or results you know
16:22
you have consultancy Services banking services Healthcare Services transportation services This falls under
16:28
service product then you know physical product can be further categorized into or the service product can be further
16:35
categorized into digital product so these are the products which are available in digital platform a virtual
16:40
or software based products that can be downloaded accessed and used online for example mobile applications software and
16:47
uh software as a services so I think now we are migrating towards uh license
16:53
based uh softwares towards uh software as a service we will have detailed disc
16:58
discussion on what is SAS what is pass in in next modules but all these things
17:04
comes under digital products streaming services then we have consumer products you know typically uh these are used by
17:12
retail customers product that designed for personal or household use shampoo groceries all the things what typical
17:18
example is example is hql so if you happen to work in Hindustan uner you will be a product manager for couple of
17:25
uh products which are used in household uh consumer applications next one is
17:31
Industrial Products so products that mean business operations and Manufacturing most of them are like a
17:36
B2B segment if you are selling if you are making a machinery and typically you are selling it to other business to
17:42
manufacture the product so again you are in uh B2B segments and these products are machinary you might sell raw
17:49
material you might sell office equipments so this is the top level information top level you know definition and categorization of uh
What is Product Management?
17:57
products let's try to understand what is product management so product management
18:02
typically referred as a PM is a professional profession responsible for guiding the success of a product and
18:08
leading the cross functional team that is responsible for improving it so product manager is a person who is
18:14
responsible for that product right from idation till end of life till its retirement and so he is the single point
18:21
of contact for the product he is the single owner to make all the decisions on that product so very very critical
18:27
role you know he has to basically he he is basically bridge between customer
18:32
business technology and user experience so if you see this image rightly represent the role of a product manager
18:39
product manager is Central entity on one side you have users and customers so you will work with the marketing team to
18:47
understand the customer requirements you will ensure that you have you will work with the design and Technology team
18:53
engineering team specifically and uiux team in order to convert those customer requirement into engineering
18:58
specification into different different prototypes and you'll be approving those prototypes and you will create a a diff
19:05
uh a proper product and parall you will have business level objectives you know
19:10
how much revenue your company is expecting from that product so a third dimension for a product manager is
19:16
business so users and customers your engineering team technology team and business team so product manager is
19:23
bridge between these three entities and as I told he's the single point of contact to make a decision on that
19:29
product so very very critical role very very visible role in the organization so
19:35
you you can see you know engineering team you might have 100 people working in engineering team but if you see a
19:41
product management vertical you will have almost not more than 10 or 15 product managers so that kind of roles
19:46
and responsibilities and criticalities exist for product management profile right side image if you can see what are
19:52
the stakeholders I'll be covering them in next slides so just to to give the glimpse so he works with the corporate
19:59
strategy he will based on that he will decide the product strategy he will work with the product delivery team so he'll
20:04
work with the sales marketing team accounts team uh he'll work with the customer service team Finance team
20:11
Business Leaders engineering team and he'll ensure that uh product meets the
20:17
target what is been return and approved in product Vision document product Vision document is basically the backbone of the product basically before
20:23
you start developing the product uh you will have detailed document a product manager will create that is called as a
20:29
vision document I will share you the template and we will have kind of couple of assignments on how to create a
20:34
product Vision document but just to give you the Glimpse that in Vision document we talk about uh why companies launching
20:40
this product uh who is the Target customer what kind of uh Revenue return on investment is expected out of this
20:46
product what what what kind of customer success criteria is there so how do you call product as successful in terms of
20:54
uh customer perspective so what are the kpis are there which will consider product as successful and all those
21:01
things are written and then it is product manager's responsibility to ensure that product meets all those kpis
21:06
if not product manager is answerable for business heads why the things are not going well and what's the mitigation
21:12
plan okay so let's try to understand evolution of product management just to
Evolution of Product Management
21:18
understand you know how how it is evolved so Evolution product management has undergone significant Evolution over
21:24
a period of time I think adopting to changing market dynamics technology iCal changes customer
21:30
expectations uh couple of Milestones I think what I can got from web are
21:36
pre-industrial era where in products were handcrafted you know there were
21:41
there was no formal concept there was no profile like a product management it was only uh how well you can craft the
21:47
product everybody was working on on shop floor basically Industrial Revolution
21:53
wherein you know machines came into the picture mass production era product began to mass production due to
21:58
advancement in manufacturing process I think at that time your Ford came up with the first automotive automotive
22:04
line for evolutionizing the product efficiency so they came up with assembly line structure concept so where Focus
22:11
was on standardization costu cost reduction sorry limited customer focus priority was uh producing as many
22:18
products as possible as at lower cost so product Centric approach with minimum
22:23
feedback loop from customers so in fact in Industrial Revolution also cost was
22:29
major concern rather than customer needs so they were having a standard products which were CED to all the customers
22:35
there was no customization so things got changed after I think uh 1930 after 1930
22:42
1935 where in you know PNG you might have heard about this company they
22:48
introduced this concept of brand management to differentiate the product and Target customers effectively so
22:55
brand man managers were responsible for positioning the product in the Target in the target market focus on product
23:02
differentiation and Market strategies and still heavily product Centric but um
23:08
they started actually at least working by focusing on customer segmentation and customer requirement so PNG was the
23:15
first one who kind of uh PVE the foundation for product management kind of role in the industry take and
23:22
software boom you know net and all what we have seen in 1980s 2000s you know with the rise of Tech Industries product
23:28
management started focus on software and digital products Agile development method started emerge focusing on quick
23:35
iteration flexibility continuous delivery customer feedback loop became integral part of product development
23:41
with the more emphasiz on U ux user experience not user interface it is only experience the role of product managers
23:48
evolved to include cross functional collaboration prioritizing customer needs and data driven decision making so
23:55
that's what started from 1980s wherein there was a single point of contact who was doing all those
24:02
activities but also he was not known as product manager so he was kind of responsible it was more or less towards
24:08
product ownership not management he was like working as a product coordinator
24:14
actual development and evolution had happened after 2000 where in agile and
24:19
Lan era came into the picture product management adopted agile and agile and Lean Startup methodologies focusing on
24:25
continuous learning iteration and uh quick product launches with MVPs minimum
24:32
viable products product managers became more uh customer Centric using data
24:38
analytics and customer feedback to iterate and refine the products and during this time I think we started
24:44
customizing the products also so geography specific customization you know based on
24:50
customers's willingness to pay so if you look at the automotive also after 2000 you can see there were uh multiple
24:57
variants you have top variant mid variant low variant so like that based on how much customer budget is you are
25:03
creating a customized product but again customization was limited for couple of options the focus shifted to solve the
25:10
real customer problems through iterative and release and testing you have I think uh instead of waterfall you started
25:16
using aile methodology so whole product Project work is divided into small small packets and then you started development
25:23
testing feedback parall so cross functional teams and collaboration across design development and marketing
25:30
become a key but again started with the software industry and uh currently if
25:36
you see the data driven product management the rise of data analytics artificial intelligence has made product
25:41
management even more uh important and more scientific product managers are now use data to make a data driven decisions
25:49
uh lot of personalization happening all products you take personalization is key now nowadays how well you can able to
25:57
make p products more and more personalized for end customers is the key and you are optimizing the products
26:04
emphasis on using data to track product success you know user Behavior performance matrices key performance
26:10
indicators product management today is highly iterative fastpaced customer Centric blending strategy user insights
26:17
and Innovation so that's where currently we are in where in U but again I'm telling you there are couple of
26:23
Industries still that those those don't have product management profile so in automotive also yesterday also I think I
26:29
repeated this message in automotive you look at the conventional companies like Tata Mahindra force uh they don't have
26:36
product managers they have product line head they have chief engineer kind of profile but again chief engineer is more
26:43
or less inward facing he's not uh looking at customer needs so for
26:49
customer needs they have product planning team so product management profile is divided into multiple uh domains and accordingly
26:56
Automotive is currently working but however if you look at at theas organization you know Ola electric uh or
27:01
ether energy or those people who are in battery management system those startups
27:06
now they have this product management profile so in software industry you will see a lot of uh product management
27:12
profiles in uh e-commerce industry you know flip cart uh Walmart Amazon these
27:19
profiles are there and slowly slowly these profiles are getting penetrated into core and Manufacturing industry as
27:25
well so and because of AI and ML and all those Technologies this is becoming
27:31
inevitable that there will be a need in each of the industry for product manager who is focused on customer needs and one
27:38
particular product at a time to maximize the revenue generated for that product so let's try to understand what are the
Levels of Product Management
27:45
levels of levels in product management domain so it starts with Associated associate product management we call it
27:52
as APM it's kind of entry level position for uh new product managers uh often uh
27:58
recent graduates are basically those who are transitioning from other roles who have I think less than three years of
28:04
experience so what are their responsibilities assisting in gathering and documenting product requirements
28:10
conducting market research competition analysis supporting you know the senior product manager or product manager in
28:17
the road map development and prioritization collaborating with the development teams on minor feature
28:23
enhancement and learning the fundamentals of product management through mentorship and handson
28:28
experience so this is more or less support role for product manager one level up associate product product
28:35
manager one level of is product management uh it is called as a mid uh level position for individuals with
28:41
which has some years of experience I would say four to five years of experience you are eligible for four to
28:48
five years of experience in product management you are eligible for PM Ro so responsibilities are defining and
28:53
managing product road map product Vision conducting in-depth market research user
28:58
analysis uh Gathering and prioritizing product requirement working closely with engineering design Marketing sales team
29:05
to deliver the product features monitoring and analyzing product performance and user feedback and
29:11
ensuring the product alliance with business goals and customer needs so essentially all the skills what we are
29:16
looking for uh are part of PM role wherein he will work with engineering
29:22
team marketing team sales team product Vision document go to market strategy he might Mentor the Junior product
29:28
associate product manager but that falls under people management skills but mostly uh all product managers will not
29:34
have any repor is mostly it is individual contributor role let's see what goes ahead so next one is senior
29:41
product manager position you know it is at 8 8 to 10 years of experience guys
29:46
typically uh advanced level position for experienced product managers with the pro and track record uh they are leading
29:53
the product strategy and road map for one or more products so it might happen that senior product manager might handle
29:59
more than one product so they manage complex and high impact product initiatives so kind of uh continuous
30:07
Improvement programs in order to improve the product efficiency they he might along with uh working on New Generation
30:14
products they might be responsible for improving the performance of existing products reducing the cost for existing
30:20
products creating a customization they might also work on you know launching the existing product into new geography
30:27
uh Ing and guiding Junior product managers and Associate product managers engaging with key stakeholders and
30:33
Executives to align product vision and Company strategy so he will have some visibility about uh company level
30:42
strategy so previous roles like they are limited to product vision and they have to create product Vision they will work
30:48
with product line head in order to get the approval for product Vision document but these guys senior product manager will have some visibility about what is
30:55
happening on organization level what is organization Vision organization Mission and he basically uh will develop a in
31:04
detail Vision document uh driving product growth through data driven decisions Innovations ensuring that
31:09
successful product launches and ongoing improvements that's the roles and responsibilities for senior product
31:15
manager position then it comes lead product manager typically 12 to 14 years
31:21
of experience uh leadership position in senior product managers with increased responsibility over multiple products or
31:27
sign significant product area overseeing the product strategy and executing the for product portfolio so he has good
31:35
about of good amount of visibility about overall product portfolio so you have within the product portfolio you will
31:41
have multiple products so he will ensure that he will develop a strategy for
31:47
product portfolio and accordingly that will get cascaded down to individual product vision and individual product strategy leading cross functional team
31:54
to ensure cohesive product development and delivery so he will sure that all product development all products are in
31:59
sync establishing and promoting best practices in product management within the team so he's expected that lead
32:07
product manager will improve the current processes the way in which uh I think
32:12
good processes for product management so this could be the contribution from the lead product manager who will
32:18
continuously check you know is there any area to improve the current processes so
32:23
it is their responsibility they will set setting and tracking the key per matrices for product success so they
32:31
will have the close eye on the kpis for product portfolio as a whole working
32:36
closely with senior leadership to align on product initiatives with company goals so as I told he will have some
32:42
visibility at uh senior level so that's what lead product manager will do then
32:48
uh the highest position as individual contributor is a principal product manager he is considered as a subject
32:55
matter expert in product management area expert level position focused on high impacted strategic initiatives across
33:02
the organization responsibilities driving strategics product initiatives that have broad implications for the
33:09
company identifying and exploring New Market opportunities and business models
33:14
so again he will look for uh Market defense uh opportunity Defense level
33:20
strategies how can you leverage existing product into a new geography new segment
33:25
leading large scale of product development experts cross functional projects serving as a thought leader and
33:31
expert within the product management Community providing deep expertise and mentoring to other product managers that
33:38
is the principal product manager so up to principal product managers uh you these profiles are individual
33:43
contributors you might not see any uh direct direct reporting so for example
33:49
in lead product manager or senior product manager they might work as a mentor but that is kind of a stretch
33:55
goal for them in order to groom the junior product managers but you hardly see you know any direct reporting for
34:02
this this kind of profiles a first level comes where it is a group product manager wherein you know it is a
34:08
managerial position overseeing team of product managers and U suit of product
34:14
so responsibilities of uh mostly managing and mentoring the team of product managers overseeing product
34:19
strategy execute execution of for group of related products ensuring alignment
34:25
of a product goals with overall business of objectives uh facilitating communication
34:31
and collaboration across product teams and other develop other departments reporting to senior leadership on
34:36
product performance and strategic initiatives so most of these uh group product managers work will go I think
34:43
30% will go in people Management Area administrative stuff but also uh what he
34:48
will do is that he will have good visibility about um overall departmental strategy organizational strategy and
34:55
accordingly he will pass that information to respect itive leads in that product management
35:01
domain but he will have direct repor is group product managers typically reports to a director of product management uh
35:09
you know it is the executive grade I would not consider group product manager as executive grade director of product management is the first executive grade
35:16
in product domain a senior leadership position responsible for overall direction and performance of a product
35:21
management function typically if you ask me years of experience uh I have hardly
35:27
seen any director of product management who has less than 18 years of experience so most of the directors are 18 plus
35:33
years of experience in product management setting a strategic direction for product management organization so
35:39
leading the development of a team product managers and group product managers so he will decide uh what are
35:45
the new product lines we are going to launch how to develop work structure for uh group product managers lead product
35:52
managers he will ensure that alignment of a product strategies with business goals and objectives so he will have
35:58
good visibility of what where is the business going what leadership is looking for and accordingly he will set
36:04
the goals managing budgets resources allocation for product initiatives he'll
36:10
be uh responsible for Budget allocation so product management whatever tools are
36:16
required if he wants to hire anybody he will have control of all the budgets for example in fact product related
36:23
decisions so if you have to for example product manager if I own a particular
36:28
product and I want uh uh marketing team to work on sales marketing strategies
36:35
and they need kind of some budget so product manager will come to director of product manager with a proper business
36:41
case so in order to improve the revenue I need to spend so and so marketing
36:47
budget so I need uh so and so marketing budget would you please approve so it's the director of product manager is the
36:52
one who will approve the budget so most of the time of director product management he will spend on budgeting
36:59
related things getting a proper justification for uh the budget requirement from a group product
37:06
managers and all he will report to vice president of product management VP of product it is executive level position
37:13
responsible for entire product management Division and responsibilities are defining the vision and strategies
37:18
for product organization overseeing the development and execution of product road maps across all product lines so he
37:25
he will have visibility of multiple product lines is what is the road map for each product line ensuring alignment between product strategy and the
37:32
company's overall business strategy so what company wants what business wants
37:37
and what basically we accordingly he will basically strategize the product
37:43
organization uh leading and mentoring senior product management leaders driving product Innovation long-term
37:49
strategic planning typically VP will create a strategy for uh 3 to 5 years
37:56
and accordingly directors and juniors are executing that product strategy representing the
38:03
product management in executive leadership team so he is representing in all the C staff wherein
38:11
you have CEO CTO CPO vice president VP of product manager reports to uh Chief
38:16
product officer highest level position in product domain uh top executive position responsible for overall product
38:22
strategy Direction and at the highest level of company responsibilities leading the entire product management
38:29
organization uh setting the overarching product vision and strategy for the
38:34
company uh driving product Innovation and ensuring competitive differentiation
38:39
he will have a close eye on what competitor is doing and accordingly he will pass that information that okay we
38:45
need to be better than our competitor and accordingly he will ensure that all those things are captured in Vision
38:51
document which will ensure that our products are differentiated with reference to competition and we have all
38:58
the goals properly captured in Vision document aligning product initiatives
39:04
with companywide goals and vision working closely with CEO and other uh C Executives which is CEO CTO coo in that
39:13
in CDU also nowadays CDO is also very common Chief data officer Executives to
39:19
drive business growth representing product organization in the board of directors level so there was a question
39:26
from I think it was somebody had asked the question on uh CPO roles and
39:32
responsibilities what's the core difference between lead senior and Lead
39:38
senior product manager and Lead product manager so there is good amount of overlap however uh lead will have
39:45
multiple senior product managers so lead is I know one level upper hierarchy if
39:51
you look at Lead Core responsibilities overseeing the product strategies and execution for product portfolio so most
39:57
of the times lead is focused uh on product portfolio basis however senior
40:03
product manager is focused on product line basis so you have product portfolio
40:09
within that portfolio you will have multiple product lines and each of the product line has multiple products so
40:15
senior has a visibility on product line basis so he's responsible for one of the
40:20
product line and however the lead have the overview of overall product portfolio and that's that's basically
40:27
different differentiates lead versus Senior so let's so let's try to understand why product management okay
Why is Product Management Important?
40:33
so pros and pros of a product management so as I told you you will get exposure
40:39
to multiple disciplines engineering Marketing sales uh Business Development
40:44
operations Finance so that's one way you will be working with multiple
40:49
disciplines you will be able to uh have very high impact because you
40:55
are the single point of contact for that product and you are ensuring that all its objectives which are written in product
41:01
Vision document are on track so just look at it you know what kind of criticality is there on of this role in
41:08
the organization so very very critical role very very high impact role I would
41:13
say that product management is the profile it is very good opportunity to for skills development so continuously
41:20
we'll be working with different different domains so you know those technicalities you will over a period of time you will understand you know uh uh
41:27
lot of things from each of these domain and I'm telling you most of the CEOs are
41:34
from originally they are work they worked as a product managers so if you take at any CEO there is high
41:41
probability that CEO might have previously worked as a product manager because product manager is the profile
41:47
wherein he will have understanding about what is happening overall in the organization in different different uh
41:54
domains so I'll consider that uh it is very good opportunity for product managers for developing their skills and
42:00
that's where you know all those CEOs uh positions will get filled career growth
42:07
you know as I told it is very very lucrative position very very high impactful position that's where you know
42:13
you'll get uh lot of visibility from higher management and uh every year you'll get lot of opportunities on um
42:20
making your product as a successful and if you can able to make it as a successful you know all those things in
42:28
it will get uh replicated in your annual appraisals you know incentive plan your
42:36
rsus and all those things cash bonus and all those things it will get uh replicated so career growth wise uh
42:43
remuneration wise very very good role so that's the pros of product management
42:48
again I think uh the two questions what you know what is the challenges for freshers or freshers I would not say
42:54
freshers those people who are experienced but not from product management experience is requirement requirement
42:59
for experience you know let's take case of you know somebody who has eight years of experience 10 years of experience and
43:05
they want to move to product management but they don't have prior knowledge of product management and why would I you
43:11
know as a recruiter why would I recruit somebody who doesn't have any experience and teach him from from the basics so
43:18
that is one of the challenge getting into product management is bit difficult if you don't have any prior experience
43:24
Second Challenge is very very high responsibility you know you will not have it is not
43:30
very is not 10 to five job to be honest you know typically if you're are working
43:35
as a product manager in multinational companies wherein you have you need you need to collaborate with the design team
43:42
in let's say in us or UK you have operations somewhere in Southeast Asia
43:47
you have to work uh 24 by7 so very very hectic job profile High responsibility
43:55
cross functional coordination basically as I told you know couple of most of the time you know if you are working in MNC
44:00
some of your stakeholders are present in different geography and uh you'll have
44:05
late night meetings you have to work early morning meetings and becomes very hectic your
44:12
family time will go for a toss not happens in all the organizations but it happens for many of the organization so
44:19
these are the challenges and uh first point you know experience requirement so let's take case of most of you you know
44:25
you guys have some years of some years of experience not in product management how can you migrate to a product manager
44:32
so I'll say as a first step you have to learn the basics of product management
44:38
so what are the skills required to skills and competencies required to become a product manager you should have
44:44
those skills that is the step number number one second uh develop soft skills
44:49
so for example you'll see since product manager is working with multiple stakeholders you have to be you you
44:57
should be a good with people you know you should have all the soft skills you know how to talk to people how to
45:02
conduct meetings how to lead CFT meetings how to manage meetings how to
45:07
organize meetings you know before going for a meeting share the agenda after the meeting share the minutes of meeting
45:13
share you should have you should be very systematic person with a very good documentation skills so at the end of
45:20
the meeting you should pass on the action items do the followup with the people and if you see you have to work
45:26
with Eng in marketing team and nobody's reporting to you so you have to
45:31
pursue the guy who is from different domain who is not reporting to you and you have to ensure that he is giving you
45:38
a right information so you have to be you have to have very good soft skills you should
45:43
be good with people build a portfolio that's where I think so learn the basics so that
45:49
basically this this course will ensure that you have all the skills required to become a product manager at the end of
45:56
the course you have so during the course basically you'll be working on multiple case studies multiple projects
46:03
which will essentially you should add it in your resume which will Define that you have handson experience on all those
46:10
skills and basically you are developing a portfolio in your resume on your LinkedIn profile that okay I have those
46:16
skills and I have hands-on experience by which I utilize those skills in order to develop a product and launch a product
46:23
so as a part of this course we have I think uh a food delivery application which is like you will be a product
46:30
scenario is you'll be a product manager for food delivery application in you supposed to develop a product Vision
46:36
document go to market strategy UI you have to ensure that UI is on track ux is on track so all those things you should
46:43
uh all the projects what you are doing as a part of this course you should add it in your profile which will justify
46:48
that you have the course skills and handson experience as a product manager but is that sufficient no next thing
46:56
which we will be doing is networking so at the end of the course I will be telling you what are the different uh
47:02
product management communities are there I would ask you to enroll and join those
47:07
communities create your network uh understand what kind of discussions happens in that uh uh portals and I'm
47:14
telling you only 30 to 40 percentage of the opportunities will get published in
47:20
LinkedIn no most of the opportunities are not even available in any of the
47:25
portal neither in company portal so I would say once you cross 8 to 10 years
47:31
of experience if you are looking for higher positions networking is the key I
47:36
know based on my experience you know mostly we prefer a guy who is referred by internal employee so networking is
47:44
very very important so with the help of those product management communities you'll get uh exposure to different
47:50
different product managers you have to create a good Network go to LinkedIn start uh creating a good repo of yours
47:58
try to create a LinkedIn post which will justify that you have all the skills and
48:03
competencies Market yourself create a profile for yourself you know don't uh
48:11
leave any of the opportunities let's let's post one particular you know article related to product management on
48:18
LinkedIn because nowadays the recruiter will look for your review the LinkedIn profile before they short list you so
48:25
creating a good networking is very very important and last gaining the relevant experience very very important so as a
48:32
part of this course you will get to work on realtime projects so that is one part
48:37
of experience so let's let's see what are the core roles and responsibilities what are the must have skills first one
Product Manager Roles and Responsibilities
48:44
first and foremost uh defining product vision and product strategy so it is product manager job to develop a clear
48:51
product Vision document that aligns with company goal so company has its own
48:56
vision and that company's Vision will be cascaded down to a product level Vision so product manager is the one who
49:03
captures that Vision a vision will have multiple components we have we have detailed assignment and handson
49:09
experience on how to create a product vision and what other the components but on top level it talks about what is this
49:14
product why companies launching this product what is the target market what kind of uh product development lifestyle
49:21
basically what are the major milestone in product development what kind of Revenue is expected out of this product
49:26
Revenue expected means again details at the end of first year how much revenue is expected at the end of second year
49:32
how much revenue is expected what is the return on investment what is the overall cost for this product customer success
49:39
criteria okay what are the top features of the product all those things will be
49:44
jotted down in the product Vision document and product manager is the author for product Vision it is not like
49:50
that he will go and individually you know he will write all those things he will work with the marketing team to
49:56
understand the customer requirement he will work with engineering team to understand how much resources required
50:01
he'll work with the finance team in order to you overall Prospect about okay
50:07
what is the cost required how many resources are required in order to develop that product he'll also get
50:12
inform um Finance about what kind of Revenue is expected out of this product so all those things are captured in the
50:18
product Vision document the core responsibility of product manager is drafting a product Vision document
50:24
understanding have a clear understanding about what are the components how to get those components and how to create a
50:30
Clear Vision document because vision is the backbone of the product Point number one point number two create a strategic
50:37
road map to guide product development and growth so how you will create a proper product road map okay road map
50:45
will have different different things okay it could be product development road map so what are the milestones in
50:50
which month in which quarter we are expecting what maturity of the product a road map could be a revenue variable
50:57
road map you know in which quarter how much revenue you are expecting it could be a market penetration related road map
51:04
you know in first year I I would like to for example let's take examp of a food delivery application so product manager
51:10
might write that okay in first quarter I will look for only Bangalore City customers in second year I Target
51:18
Bangalore Plus myour in third third quarter I'll try I'll Target you know whole couple of more tier cities in
51:25
adjacent States in fourth quarter I will Target some more cities across India so
51:31
like that he will create a proper road map so as a product manager you should be able to create a road map and those
51:38
road maps are should be justifiable those should be realistic and those
51:43
should be basically a data driven so all the decisions what prodct manager will take those should be data driven so why
51:50
did you decided that by end of this quarter you should be you are going to capture so and so Revenue what is the
51:57
basis how can you justify that statement so you should be able to create good road map which are justifiable and you
52:04
should be able to justify it with a proper data backup so okaye I did so and so Market search with reference to so
52:11
and so I have done you know this kind of my data analytics model and then I based on that I have some these are the
52:17
assumptions and based on that I created this particular milestone in the road map so the core responsibility is
52:23
driving Vision document creating a project road map second one conducting market research
52:30
gather and analyze Market data to understand customer needs so marketing
52:35
team is there who will conduct the market you know he will work with customers but it is product manager's
52:40
responsibility to analyze that data which is captured by marketing team and come up with the insights okay what is
52:47
exactly customer need okay this is customer requirement but can we how can we categorize that customer requirement
52:53
is it a must have is it a should have it is good to have accordingly he will
52:59
convert those requirement into features and then accordingly he will con he will prioritize those features what are the
53:05
must have features what are the should have features what are the good to have features so as a product manager you
53:11
should be able to analyze marketing data and to understand customer
53:16
needs you as a product manager should have a good understanding about marketing Trend and competitive
53:22
landscape so overall how Market is going forward for all your top customers what
53:28
customers are doing it and again for each of these line items you have you'll have some resources so there are come
53:34
couple of agencies who will give you you know overall marketing Trends so your
53:40
company will have the subscription but it is your responsibility to go through those brouchers to understand how things
53:46
are going on product manager typically attends all those uh industry
53:52
conferences and he'll check what are the new trends are coming who are all the new suppliers how can we leverage new
53:58
suppliers what else we can do in your existing portfolio in order to improve the performance reduce the cost or and
54:05
basically at the end you are trying to differentiate your product and you're trying to create competitive Advantage for your
54:12
product so you should have a good understanding about uh marketing things
54:18
marketing Trends competitive landscape use insights to to inform
54:24
product decisions and priorities yeah so at end basically do the analysis and get
54:29
those insights you'll have you'll create a hypothesis you'll do the hypothesis testing again we go to customer for
54:36
checking whether your hypothesis correct or not but based on those data driven decisions hypothesis you are going to
54:42
make product level decisions and that should justify should be justifiable so
54:48
that is the core roles and responsibilities next one planning and
54:53
prioritizing defining product features as I told you know capturing marketing requirement is one thing but how can you
54:59
convert those marketing requirement to product features how can you prioritize those features and again you know always there
55:07
will be a conflict between marketing team might say Okay I want this feature also this feature also that feature also
55:13
but again you have a limited resources resources could be uh budgeting related
55:20
resources you have given a budget like 10 million you can't use more budget you
55:25
have so and so developers okay engineering team told that for this product you have only three developers
55:31
one project manager so that's what is available so you don't have infinite resources so that's where prioritization
55:37
comes into the picture so how well you prioritize it how well you understood
55:42
the customer requirements and based on that you decided that okay I would like to launch feature one first because that
55:49
is more important than feature two which is kind of less impact so you should have the good understanding about
55:55
features and it's impact on the End customer how much value you are adding to the End customer so that's what it
56:00
talks about Define features prioritize them into business value and customer impact create and manage product backlog
56:07
so which talks about okay what are those features again it is it falls under road map category so you'll have core
56:14
features which you would like to launch in the first and accordly you have subsequent features as a backlog and
56:20
then accordingly you should launch it in the next versions of product ensure uh overall product plan product road map is
56:28
aligned with overall product strategy so you have to ensure that always there is a correlation between planning versus
56:34
product Vision document Vision talks about overall what is expected from the product and uh your prioritization
56:41
planning should justify that okay if you do all those things you are going to achieve what is written in the vision
56:46
document number four stakeholder management communicate effectively with stakeholders what are the stakeholders
56:52
okay developers designers marketing team sales team Executives engineering team
56:58
what not you know we have detailed slides which are all the stakeholders product manager we work with but
57:04
essentially you'll work with engineering team operations team higher management team and you should be communicate
57:11
effectively and you should have good stakeholder management skills you should be good with people you'll create a
57:16
first draft you will have a lot of concerns from engineering team designer team marketing team then you will talk
57:22
to them you will negotiate couple of things you will ra a second version document again there are some concerns
57:30
so like that it is iterative process so as for my experience to develop a good Vision document it will take minimum two
57:36
to three months so product manager will will will work closely with each of these teams and basically you will draft
57:43
Vision document and get the alignment drafting is only one month of job getting the alignment will take a lot of
57:48
time there are lot of concerns and there are a lot of conflicts between different different teams and then you have to
57:54
manage those conflicts yes Point suggest that we manage expectations and ensure that all parties are alligned on the
58:00
product Vision so that's the core responsibility of product manager so that's where you know I was telling your
58:05
documentation skills will come into the picture lot of things you have to handle so that's where you know whenever you
58:10
are trying to schedule a call for vision alignment you have to go with proper preparation whatever is discussed in the
58:16
last meeting cu the minutes of meeting what you are going to discuss in this particular meeting create a very clear
58:22
agenda and at the end of the meeting if there are some action items clearly document minutes of meeting who wants
58:27
what do the followup ensure that all things are on track and then go for next version next iteration so that's the
58:34
core skill of product management stakeholder management let's go to next one leading the cross functional team
58:40
collaboration with engineering design marketing so you are doing the stakeholder management but you are the lead in that CFT meetings cross
58:47
functional team meetings so as I told you know all the leading skills ensuring that meetings happen smoothly you get
58:53
alignment with all those things fter collaborative and productive team environment very very important most of
58:59
the time you might happen that there is a heated discussion in the room and it is very difficult to get consensus from
59:05
different different parties that's where your soft skills will come into the picture how well you can uh navigate
59:11
that situation and how well you can get the alignment is very very important
59:16
ensure timely delivery and high quality products so that's what is the expected
59:22
next one execution and delivery oversee the product development life cycle from concept to launch so you will have
59:28
weekly reviews bi-weekly reviews monthly reviews with engineering team during the development phase so they will show the
59:34
progress you that's where you know I was telling you should have the minimum skills in engineering domain so that you
59:41
can ask right questions to engineering team if engineering manager says okay I need one resource in order in order to
59:47
develop this this particular feature for two months you should be in a position
59:52
to ask him the right questions you should be in a position to to uh check
59:57
whatever he says is realistic or not so that kind of minimum knowledge is required monitor product performance and
1:00:04
iterate based on the user feedback analysis that's where you know kpis will come into the picture so in the vision
1:00:09
document you have the kpis okay product should perform in this particular way so
1:00:14
all you have you have performance targets you have Financial targets you have budgeting related targets so always
1:00:21
you have to keep uh that's where you know we develop lot of dashboards product management is all about developing dashboards you create a
1:00:28
dashboard for financial kpis you create a dashboard for product performance related kpis and you will closely
1:00:34
monitor if things are on track or not on track if things are not on track it is your responsibility to ask right
1:00:40
questions to respective stakeholder and ensure that things are on track and you are on track when it comes to product
1:00:47
Vision document ensure product meets quality standards and business goals so again it is with reference to Quality
1:00:53
kpis and business goals and and last but not least analyzing data and matrices so
1:00:59
all seven are must have but one very very important thing what product manager should have you should be good
1:01:05
with numbers every day you will get Excel spreadsheets so much of data you
1:01:10
know you should be able to convert that raw data into a insight and uh
1:01:16
accordingly you should be able to justify your decisions you should be just you should be able to justify your
1:01:22
argument with different different stakeholders all the decisions what you are going to take will be questioned by
1:01:27
each of the stakeholder so you should have solid data backup so to make that data backup you should be good with
1:01:33
numbers so once you have Excel pret data you have 5,000 rows immediately you should be able to understand okay what
1:01:40
does this data tells so for one first week of every month you'll get Revenue data so immediately you should be able
1:01:47
to understand do the data analysis and check okay whether you are doing good with reference to last month
1:01:53
or whether you are not doing good with reference to last month what kind of forecasting you did in last month and
1:02:00
where you know just check forecasted results versus actual results and accordingly you should be able to
1:02:05
correct forecasting methodologies and if things are not going well you should be able to pinpoint okay revenue is not
1:02:12
going well why revenue is not going well okay I'm last month I had so many
1:02:17
customers from this particular geography but it has found that for this month data this particular geography has I'm
1:02:24
getting lower Revenue so let's go one step lower why we are getting less
1:02:30
revenue on that geography whether customer consumer Behavior has changed or what are the things or let's check
1:02:37
what competitor has done in that month is competitor Revenue increases increased so that means whatever
1:02:43
customers I lost those have been converted to went to competitor
1:02:48
basically so why did you know uh customer left my platform and went to competitor so that kind of analysis you
1:02:55
should be able to do it by looking at the data you should be pretty good with numbers use data to make informed
1:03:01
decisions Drive continuous improvements report product performance to stakeholders you know kpis dashboards
1:03:08
what that these are the things I told okay guys uh is the roles and responsibilities clear so these are the
1:03:13
core responsibilities of a product manager seven points just a quick info guys intellipath offers product

1:03:55
product man management so let me start with the skills required to become a product manager or skills uh which are
1:04:01
the skills which are mandatory for product manager so the first one is I think as we disc analytical thinking
Skill Set Required for a Product Manager
1:04:08
product manager is the profile who is going to make a decision on your product
1:04:13
so he should be good in analytical thinking so what does that mean is ability to analyze Market data ability
1:04:21
to analyze user feedback and most importantly make data driven decisions to improve product performance improve
1:04:28
product Revenue you know reduce cost improve basically the competitive
1:04:33
competitive Advantage for your product so very very core skill you should be a good at analytical thinking you should
1:04:39
be good with good at numbers so most of your time almost 60 to 70 percentage of time you'll be working with numbers
1:04:46
you'll be analyzing the numbers you'll be using different different uh methodologies in order to come up with
1:04:51
the insights from a given data and uh quickly if you can able to analyze those numbers come up with hypothesis prove
1:04:58
your hypothesis I think that will be a added Advantage for you so analytical thinking is a core and the most
1:05:05
important skill for a product manager in fact I will give more importance than stakeholder Management number two is
1:05:11
communication as as we discussed you know in roles and responsibilities product manager needs to work with the different different stakeholders right
1:05:18
from marketing team for understanding the customer requirement you know to engineering team in order to develop a
1:05:24
product to sales team in order to uh launch the product work uh generate a
1:05:29
leads for for the customer trying to understand the customer feedback he'll work with the manufacturing team he'll
1:05:35
work with the supply chain team so he should be good at communication there are multiple topics in fact we have one
1:05:41
module if you I don't know there is one module particularly one phase particularly about analytical decision
1:05:47
making uh there we are going to cover how to come up with a data driven decision making by using different
1:05:53
different tools so there in that mod we will cover the details about analytical thinking scope of work is just to
1:05:59
understand top level what are the skills required to become a product manager and as as in when we go to the next modules
1:06:06
I think uh we'll go much uh one level deeper two level deepers okay so
1:06:11
communication a clear and effective communication with all the stakeholders ability to articulate product vision and
1:06:17
strategy as I told you know product manager is the one who is the owner for vision document product Vision document
1:06:23
product defining the product strategy so he should be able to articulate you know
1:06:29
what he has he has done a detailed analysis accordingly he has come up with the product Vision document and then he should be able to articulate it he
1:06:35
should be able to sell that product Vision to the respective stakeholders and get their alignment writing a
1:06:41
detailed product requirement and documentation so he'll get a top level requirements from marketing team but in
1:06:47
order to convert those uh marketing requirements into uh at least system
1:06:52
level specification he is a job of product manager so he should would be able to create a a detailed product requirement documentation and again
1:06:59
there are different tools and methodologies where product manager is going to use he might use u a Trello he
1:07:05
might use a jira in order to effectively create those requirement documents but having said that he should have some
1:07:11
knowledge some domain knowledge of the product so by understanding the customer requirement document he should be able to create uh different different
1:07:18
features and then he should be able to pass it on to engineering team for product development so that is to
1:07:23
communication second one uh third one is about the leadership as I told uh in previous section so product manager is
1:07:30
the one who will lead different different cross functional teams we call it as a cfts so leading and motivating
1:07:36
cross functional teams is very very important you know fostering collaboration and driving the team
1:07:41
productivity uh is also important because you are the host you are the organizer for those CFT meetings you are
1:07:46
leading those CFT meetings you have to ensure that everybody is participating everybody is sharing their feedback and
1:07:53
meeting managements you know you should be able to keep track of how many open points are there what has been discussed
1:07:58
in the last meeting what you are planning to do in the next meeting where are the minutes of meetings are stored who owns what action item by when things
1:08:05
are due so all those things you should be able to manage it you should be able to lead those cfts handling the
1:08:10
conflicts and managing decisive decisions very very important every features every step what product
1:08:17
managers will do they there will be a conflict between different different stakeholders so marketing team will be
1:08:23
telling I need so many features as in will tell I need so many resources but again at the end of the day you have
1:08:29
limited budgets limited resources limited time in hand in order to launch product so considering all those things
1:08:35
you should be able to resolve the conflicts so how to resolve the conflicts number one just analyze the
1:08:40
features from customer impact perspective and then I think in third or fourth model we are going to use some
1:08:46
Frameworks called as Moscow model where in we are going to prioritize the features based on must have should have
1:08:52
good to have and then you should be able to Prior and accordingly you should be able to use available resources in order
1:08:58
to develop high impact driven features so that's how you should be able to
1:09:04
handle the conflict resolve the conflict number four problem solving quickly identify and addressing the issues let's
1:09:10
take example you know you are the product manager product is already been launched and uh monthly you are going
1:09:15
and talking to sales team okay I would like to understand the customer feedback about the product so he will give Google
1:09:21
reviews he will give multiple reviews but quickly you should be able to analyze that data because the reviews
1:09:27
content is very high so you should be able to analyze the you know those reviews you should be able to check what
1:09:32
is the major issue customer customers are facing on your product our top five issues and basically you should be able
1:09:39
to come up with the strategy in order to improve your next iteration of your product so problem solving is very very
1:09:44
important you should be able to quickly understand the problem statement from customer side and you should be able to come up with a proper strategy in order
1:09:51
to resolve that issue developing innovative solutions to solve complex problem and navigating tradeoffs and
1:09:57
prioritizing the task again it goes back to conflict resolution prioritization wherein you'll have multiple perspective
1:10:04
from different different stakeholders you'll have multiple priorities you should be able to create a proper right priority for your product and you should
1:10:10
be able to accordingly Drive the product development and issue resolution again all the decisions what you are going to
1:10:17
make let's go back to number one analytical thinking all the decisions what you are going to make should be
1:10:22
based on a solid data backup so that's where you know while you are prioritizing this particular feature you should have backup data while you are
1:10:28
not prioritizing this particular feature you should have backup data even though customers are you have a lot of customers on one particular feature but
1:10:35
still you decided that not to work upon uh improving that or resolving that issue rather than you have given
1:10:41
importance to something else you should be able to justify with the data so problem solving is also another core
1:10:46
skill for a product manager number five market and user research understanding customer needs and market trends you
1:10:52
know you should have overall perspective about what is happening in your Market what competitors are doing overall
1:10:59
weather Market uh how far basically what is the direction in which Market is going what is the trend of a market so
1:11:06
you should have a good understanding about overall Market perspective and you should be able to conduct competitive
1:11:13
analysis again marketing team will be there in order to do all those things but you should be able to again they
1:11:18
they are the one who will Who will give you the information but you should be able to conduct leverage that information and come up with a Sol
1:11:25
insights about what is your competitive analysis who are your who are all your core customer core competitors primary
1:11:31
competitors who are all your secondary competitors a competitor a is good at what competitor B is good at what is
1:11:37
what is the sort analysis for competitor a s stands for strengths weakness opportunities threats so you should be
1:11:43
able to conduct s analysis for competitors you should be able to conduct s analysis for your product translating research insights into
1:11:50
actionable product features as we told uh uh marketing team will give customer uh requirement ments however converting
1:11:56
those customer requirements into a proper features it is the responsibility of a product manager so you should be
1:12:01
able to understand those customer requirements and convert them into features and prioritize those features
1:12:07
based on customer impact number six technical knowledge understanding technical aspect of a product development so basically if I am not
1:12:14
from engineering background I am from some different background how much engineering competencies I should be able to having to become a product
1:12:21
manager so this is one of the core skills required for a product manager you should have a bare minimum
1:12:27
competencies in your domain so that you should be able to talk effectively with engineering team you should be able to
1:12:32
understand convey first of all what is customer expectation from the product and you should be able to ask them the
1:12:38
right question whenever engineering team is going to come up or showing you some timeline okay I need so many resources I
1:12:44
mean I need so much you know kind of uh timeline is required in order to develop a product you should be able to ask them
1:12:50
a right questions balancing technical constraints with business goals so this is last one is very very important so
1:12:56
you should be able to balance technical constraints and business goals so both things should go hand inand and you are
1:13:02
the one who is going to manage both the both the dimensions last one but not the least strategic thinking so you should
1:13:09
be able to have a long you should be able to develop a long-term product vision and strategy that's one of the
1:13:14
core skill aligning product goals with the business objectives because on on on organizational level you have Clarity
1:13:21
what organization wants to do in future accordingly you should be able to create the product Vision which aligns with
1:13:27
company vision and anticipate uh Market changes and planning accordingly so most
1:13:34
of the time it might happen that you have develop product Vision document product development is almost started or
1:13:39
it came to a much matured State and then because of so and so reason things got changed because of you know
1:13:46
macroeconomic Factor because of some customer priorities have been changed because technology has been changed then
1:13:53
you should be able to understand the impct of that change on your product and accordingly you should be flexible
1:13:59
enough to adopt those change on your product vision and product development so strategically you should be able to
1:14:05
think and you should be able to adjust your uh end goal accordingly if the things are changing on the way let's
1:14:12
take a let's take a second bullet of strategic thinking aligning product goals with business objectives so let's
1:14:18
take any organization and uh as a product manager you should be able to understand where company want to what
1:14:25
company wants to do in near future and accordingly he should be able to uh develop the Next Generation product
1:14:32
which aligns with company's objective so maybe to make it more clearer talk about let's talk about your organization and
1:14:38
then let's take that case study in order to make this concept more clear and uh
1:14:44
let's take example of uh in order to achieve that company's Vision if today if if you are a product manager for your
1:14:51
organization if you want to develop a new product uh I'll basically elaborate that case how you can able to capture
1:14:58
some things which can able to in your new new generation product which can able to help company to to basically
1:15:05
achieve its long-term Vision good so let's take as a anti-diabetic uh so your company's long-term vision is you know
1:15:12
develop some products which are which falls under anti-diabetic criteria and
1:15:18
uh because they see a huge Market potential you know India is known for uh diabetic capital of the world and that's
1:15:26
where you know company wants to develop a new generation product and now today if you are a product manager and if you
1:15:32
have an opportunity to uh develop a new generation product in that case you
1:15:37
should be able to if you can able to Target this particular use case as uh anti-diabetic developing a or maybe if
1:15:45
you can uh okay let me take it if you can able to enhance your current
1:15:50
generation products which are in anti-diabetic category and if you are developing
1:15:55
uh Advanced product which can enhance the capability of current generation products which are in anti-diabetic
1:16:01
category it aligns with your company's long-term vision and with that one you you you know a probability of uh
1:16:09
becoming your product as successful is more so that that that could be one of
1:16:15
the use case I can tell so you should strategic thinking basically should have a long-term perspective about what what
1:16:22
where industry is going where your organization wants to go and accordingly you should be able to develop your
1:16:29
product Vision documentally you should be able to understand okay what are those areas if I can capture in my
1:16:34
product Vision document how can I create a bigger impact on organizational level what my organization wants to do and
1:16:40
accordingly how can I capture some things in my product which helps organization to achieve its objectives
1:16:46
those products which company has never made it before and first time they are making it so that's the basically
1:16:52
difference 20 to 30 percentage only npds are there most of the cases it is carryer how it is independent things you
1:16:58
know CTC when you work in India is very very different as compared to when you work in Emerging Markets like
1:17:03
Philippines or if you directly work in offshore okay so CTC is very very different as compared to you know how
1:17:08
many opportunities you have how desperately organization is looking for so that is independent Visa what is the
1:17:14
overall value or what is the overall budgeting required for a software engineer if you want to hire him for
1:17:21
monthly basis these are more or less very standard and basically that defines the budget required for overall product
1:17:28
development so I think both are independent uh let me hold you there itself program manager will come into
1:17:34
the picture mostly you know when the actual product development will start when the features are finalized you know
1:17:39
all the things are developed and then you have program manager have overall information for example I need to
1:17:45
develop so many features and have I have so many uh basically so much budget
1:17:50
available and then right within that budget how to allocate how many resources that is what you are telling
1:17:56
program manag but I'm talking about at the time of developing a vision document what is the overall budget required for
1:18:02
product development top level and one of that component goes to engineering and that will be taken forward by program
1:18:09
manager I think that's what we are going to discuss next slide we have a lot of I think questions regarding what program
1:18:14
manager does what project manager does I think that's what we are going to cover in the next slide uh but to answer your
1:18:21
question we are talking about product manager roles and responsibilities we are talking about budgeting for product
1:18:26
development and that happens on the during the vision finalization overall budget is been finalized one of the
1:18:32
component goes to engineer and then it is program manager's responsibilties that he will conduct the product development within the initially
1:18:39
allocated budget so that's kind of you know execution part of it but I'm talking about strategic part of it when
1:18:46
basically at the at the beginning itself what is the budget required in order to develop a product and you know why that
1:18:51
is important because I think once you get actual once you get hands-on exper experience on actual product Vision
1:18:57
development you'll understand because your vision should justify the return on investment so budgeting talks about how
1:19:02
much compan is investing in order to develop and launch this product in Vision you should you will have the
1:19:07
information about your expected Revenue so how much revenue you are expecting in first year in second year in third year
1:19:14
so at and basically your vision will include what is the uh uh Q Point
1:19:20
basically what is the point at which you are start after how many years you will start actually making profit break point
1:19:26
they call it as a so what is your breaking break point what is the overall return on investment so all those things
1:19:32
are included in the vision document so what you talking about is the execution part what I'm talking about much before
1:19:37
you know at Vision document at strategy level in fact you know uh you should
1:19:43
have the thought process so you are mentioning only two Dimensions one is the marketing Dimension about the
1:19:48
operations I would say you will you have to use couple of more Dimensions like
1:19:53
engineering dimension so you have to use from customer satisfaction perspective also I think you'll get more clearer
1:19:59
understanding when it comes to product Vision document once we have start I think working on product Vision format
1:20:05
template what are the component it involves I think uh huh that's where you know your uh so okay customer s because
1:20:13
you know marketing team told you that I have so many customer requirements you as a product manager has convert
1:20:18
clustered those requirements into feature one feature two feature three feature 4 and based on your analysis you
1:20:23
have prioritized features so since you have a limited budget you decided that couple of features you are going to
1:20:30
deprioritize it so that will have impact on customer satisfaction because you are not going to fulfill couple of customer
1:20:36
requirements so what is the overall risk for your um uh product success when you
1:20:42
are eliminating those features because of having so and so constraints so all those analysis you need to do it so
1:20:47
that's what I I was start basically talking about customer satisfaction perspective because already you have understood okay customer has so and for
1:20:54
requirements and now you decided that you are not going to meet couple of requirements because you feel that you have limited resources so all the
1:21:01
features you cannot implement it okay so very very common questions what exactly
Product Manager vs Product Management vs Program Management
1:21:07
what are the difference between product manager versus project manager versus program manager just to bring the clarity about what exactly product
1:21:13
manager to so let's uh I I created I think three slides product manager then project manager program manager and then
1:21:20
I created a side by-side difference just to get a very clear understanding so quickly go over product manager so
1:21:26
product manager is responsible for product strategy product road map product feature definition of a product
1:21:31
or product line responsibilities a vision and strategy Define the product Vision Define the product strategy and
1:21:37
direction of a product conduct market research to understand customer needs and market trends product road map
1:21:42
create and maintain product road map ensuring that alignment with the business goals so what you would like to
1:21:48
launch uh product road map basically how many versions of this product will be launched which version will be launched
1:21:54
in which time duration and it will have which features so all those things will be captured in product road map
1:21:59
requirement Gathering he should be able to understand the customer requirement he should be able to convert them into a feature stakeholder communication as we
1:22:06
discussed he will work with multiple stakeholders you know including Executives customers development teams so stakeholder communication feature
1:22:13
prioritization okay customer requirements into features and then prioritization and product life cycle
1:22:19
management oversee entire life cycle of a product from concept to retirement and
1:22:24
uh he should be able to understand customer feedback gather analyze customer feedback complet and accordingly you should be able to take
1:22:31
appropriate action for solving the product level problems so this is kind
1:22:36
of repetitive what we understood uh roles and responsibilities of AIS and key skills of a product manager so now
1:22:42
let me highlight a project manager okay so project manager is very much engineering focused uh profile you know
1:22:50
uh so role is project manager is responsible for planning executing and closing projects ensuring they are
1:22:56
completed on time within the scope and within the budget so a common terminology is TCS within time t for
1:23:03
time C for cost within the budget and S for within the scope so project manager
1:23:09
is all about uh ensuring that the project is within the TCS time cost and
1:23:16
within the scope what are there what are his responsibilities a project planning develop a detailed project plan
1:23:21
including scope objectives timeline and resour allocation uh Resource Management coordinate resources including team
1:23:28
members tools materials budget management again resource management for
1:23:34
the basically resource for project level budget management again project level budget manage the budget project budget
1:23:40
and ensure that you know it is cost Effectiveness it is cost effective uh risk management you should have clear
1:23:47
understanding about what are the different risk on a project level and he should have a risk mitigation strategy he should ensure that the project is on
1:23:53
timeline quality assurance ensure that the project deliverables meet the quality standards stakeholder
1:23:59
communication regularly commun communicate project status and issues success to a stakeholder and overall you
1:24:05
should make sure that the project has a proper documentation so a product development will have multiple feature
1:24:12
development each feature can be developed with you know just to give a top level information a product can be
1:24:19
developed by developing multiple features let's take example of feature one a feature one if you have to develop
1:24:26
it needs um it is basically the collaboration of multiple projects and a
1:24:32
project manager is responsible for developing one particular piece of that one feature so you have product manager
1:24:39
and then you have project manager project manager is connected to a piece of one particular feature so that's how you should be able to uh imagine where
1:24:46
does the product project manager fits and these are his rnrs and last one is a program manager uh program manager is
1:24:53
basically role is programing manager will oversees the group of related projects a program to ensure that they
1:24:58
are managed and coordinated to achieve the Strategic objective so group of uh
1:25:04
projects is called as a program so a program manager program planning Define the program structure including
1:25:10
objectives scope of work success criteria alignment with strategy ensure that the program aligns with
1:25:16
organization strategy goals and objectives uh resource coordination allocate and manage resources across
1:25:21
projects within the program inter project uh coordination so he should ensure that there is a Synergy benefits
1:25:27
between different different projects which happens under his program ensure that project within the programs are
1:25:33
integrated and coordinated effectively that's where you know uh the cost Effectiveness will come into the picture
1:25:38
can issue management identify the manager identify and manage the risk and issue on a program level within the
1:25:44
program performance monitoring track and ref of all different programs are projects are happening within that
1:25:49
program stakeholder management mostly program manager will coordinate with the uh only project managers and project
1:25:56
manager will coordinate with the engineering resources and it could be e engineer it could be software Engineers
1:26:01
benefit uh realization ensure that program delivers intended benefit and value to the organization these are top
1:26:07
level features now let's see you know the side by side comparison if you if you take example of focus a product
1:26:14
manager focuses on product success customer satisfaction and you know he should continuously thinking how can
1:26:21
able to make a product which fits to the end customer Market fit so this is what
1:26:27
product manager focuses he he is always looking at the product from customer perspective and he's checking that how
1:26:34
how can I develop a best product which will fit the customer requirement Visa a project manager will focus on delivering
1:26:40
the specific project on timeline so he's focused only on that particular project and he have to ensure that project is on
1:26:46
time within the scope and within the budget so he's only focused on that particular piece of one particular
1:26:51
feature program manager focuses on strategic alignment and coordination of multiple projects so okay how many
1:26:57
project managers are there under me so I have five project managers so I have to ensure that I can uh there is a good
1:27:03
amount of synergy between these five project managers and uh focus on strategic alignments and coordination
1:27:09
between multiple projects so this is what the focus is second let's look at the difference from scope perspective
1:27:16
project manager scope of work is uh it could be a single product or M in a product line project manager he is kind
1:27:23
of typically project man managers handles one project at a time and program manager he handles uh basically
1:27:29
group of projects outcome what is the outcome of product manager product manager ensures that product meets the
1:27:35
market needs and achieve the business related goals project manager's outcome is he will ensure that project is
1:27:41
completed successfully you know within the TCS what we developed time cost and scope program manager will ensure that
1:27:47
program delivers are intended at intended basically delivers its intended strategic benefits what are the key
1:27:54
matrices for project manager product manager product manager matrices basically customer adaptation rate
1:28:00
return on investment Revenue customer satisfaction so on product level all product level matrices you can see for
1:28:06
product manager project manager matrices are basically through like ontime delivery budget scope and program
1:28:13
manager is Success Through program matrices like overall return on investment alignment for a given set of
1:28:19
projects what he owns is the difference between these three clear so we are talking about about product manager
1:28:25
program manager program manager these are engineering specific roles which happens in engineering domain program
1:28:31
manager a piece of one particular feature sorry project manager is a piece of one particular feature and program
1:28:38
manager is the one who handles multiple project managers under him and he will
1:28:43
ensure that there is a good amount of coordination between different different
1:28:48
projects R and rs between product program and project is clear is there shall be several projects under one
1:28:55
product yeah yeah there will be multiple projects under one product so just to give you hierarch product development
1:29:00
can happen uh within one product you will have multiple features even um each
1:29:06
feature will have multiple projects a feature a software part of feature will be developed by a software project
1:29:13
manager a hardware part of that project will be developed by Hardware feature a UI of part of that feature will be
1:29:19
developed by UI project manager so you have product and below that you'll have
1:29:26
under the product you'll have multiple projects so project manager role is very very small it has very limited scope but
1:29:35
product manager is very very vast and he will he will have he will basically a
1:29:40
single point of contact for that product the project is a part of product what about program so program is uh typically
1:29:48
uh you know in the most of the mncs you have this role program manager program manager is kind of uh leading a group of
1:29:56
project managers leading a group of product uh project managers so ensure
1:30:01
that program deliver intent so let me go to program manager again uh program managers oversee a group of related
1:30:07
projects a program to ensure that they are managed and coordinated to achieve the Strategic
1:30:12
objectives okay fine move ahead I think last time there was one question about
Product Manager vs Business Analyst
1:30:18
what about ba business analyst so earlier I was not having this one uh ba
1:30:24
Rel you know side by side comparison of product versus ba because both the roles are there is some overlap but mostly
1:30:32
they are very very indifferent uh so let me explain the ba
1:30:37
related work also since I think some of you as working as a ba So ba is business analyst focuses on understanding the
1:30:44
business needs analyzing processes providing data driv recommendations to improve the business outcome
1:30:51
responsibilities for business analys is uh elicit document and manage requirement from stakeholders ensure
1:30:57
that requirement aligns with the business objectives mostly you'll focus on process improvements analyze the
1:31:03
current business processes analyze areas for improvements and purpose solution propose solution data analysis gather
1:31:10
the data and data and inform business related decisions provide insights Based
1:31:16
on data analysis documentation create detailed documentation including business requirements so brds we call it
1:31:22
as a functional specification user stories maintain clear and organized
1:31:28
records of a business processes stakeholder communication ficate communication
1:31:34
between business stakeholders and Technical teams ensure stakeholder needs are accurately translated into technical
1:31:41
requirements but again that particular business I think next slide we'll talk about um side by side with reference to
1:31:48
product solution assessment evaluate propos solutions to ensure they meet business needs conduct physic ility
1:31:54
studies and impact analysis assist in technical phase to ensure the
1:31:59
requirements are met validate solutions to ensure they resolve and identify business problems and provide the
1:32:06
training and end user on new systems or processes offer ongoing support to
1:32:12
ensure successful implementation so this is I think will give more clarity so Focus for BA is focus on understanding
1:32:20
the business needs improving processes and providing actionable ins sites for one particular or one particular
1:32:26
customer or set of customers I would say it doesn't have the visibility for all the customers typically ba is for
1:32:32
limited customers however product manager is single point of contact for that particular product focuses on
1:32:38
product success Market Feit and customer satisfaction scope of work for business analyst is work on specific project or
1:32:44
initiatives to analyze and improve a business process so he's very much focused on one particular aspect of that
1:32:50
business process responsibilities of a business analys involves requirement Gathering business business process
1:32:57
improvements data analysis documentation stakeholder communication related to business needs one particular business
1:33:03
needs for one particular customer however product manager will have holistic um approach on all the
1:33:10
customers and on all the aspects what is the outcome for business analyst ensure
1:33:15
that business processes are efficient effective aligned with business objectives ensure product meets the
1:33:21
market and the product managers of you outcome is whatever is written in the vision document you know return on
1:33:26
investment business goals customer uh how how many customers we are acquiring
1:33:32
all those things interaction with teams so business analyst will closly work with that particular you know project
1:33:38
manager technical teams ensure that Solutions are made for business needs and uh product manager you know works
1:33:44
with Marketing sales development customer support basically what not most of the stakeholders what we discussed in
1:33:51
previous slides so this is a top level difference between product managers and business analyst
1:33:57
so skill sets roles and responsibilities 1 2 3 okay fine uh
1:34:03
small there is a small module uh service what is you know typically do we have
1:34:08
product management profile for in service based industry so uh let's let's discuss that one and then we can so key
Service Product Management
1:34:16
aspect of a service product management so instead of product it is basically
1:34:22
service you hardly see any difference you know you just have to look at instead of product you have to look
1:34:28
at from service perspective so what he does service design Define the service
1:34:34
concept so he has to Define service concept identify customer needs designing the
1:34:40
service process to deliver high quality experience so instead of product he will have service
1:34:45
perspective uh t uh what is that taml
1:34:51
turnaround time is that what how fastly you can deliver the service turnaround time is uh one of the important kpi but
1:35:00
again you quality of the service also will come into the picture so there are multiple kpis for service side so
1:35:07
service design a key aspect market research similar to product manager service product manager will do the
1:35:13
market research from service perspective analyze the market Trend customer preferences competitive landscape and
1:35:20
inform service development and Improvement service development okay collaborating with various teams to
1:35:26
create Implement new services or enhance existing services customer experience
1:35:32
ensure the service meets the existing customer expect or exceeds the customer expectation pardon me addressing the pin
1:35:39
points and enhancing overall satisfaction performance monitoring again you have kpi similar to that of a
1:35:45
product based companies you'll have kpis for service based uh companies one of
1:35:51
the kpi what amul told is the turnaround time T cross functional collaboration okay
1:35:58
similar to product management for product based companies you'll have similar stakeholders for service
1:36:06
based product management profiles also just to give an I think some example for
1:36:12
service based uh products so let's take example of
1:36:18
healthcare so you have the services called as a T Health Services is T
1:36:24
Health is what basically managing the development and Improvement of T Health platforms ensuring that they meet um
1:36:30
patient needs I think you must have okay one of the example is prao if you know prao they have very famous application
1:36:38
nowadays for health T Health Services so it is uh uh service based product
1:36:43
management example wherein they will they have developed a platform wherein they have doctors on boarded and
1:36:50
accordingly they are giving different different Services which CS to patient need and um Healthcare Services then
1:36:58
basically they have patient care programs overseeing the chronic disease management programs ensuring that they
1:37:04
provide comprehensive care and support to the patients so this prao is good
1:37:09
example for healthcare which defines the service bestas product management profiles you have multiple profiles
1:37:16
product management profiles in service when it comes to uh Finance uh Mobile Banking you know uh
1:37:24
mobile banking services developing I would say at top of my mind you know you had uh product management profiles in
1:37:31
patm you had product management profiles for uh a grow you had product management
1:37:37
profiles for zeroda and you know multiple you know hdfc's and all those Banks also they
1:37:43
have product management profiles Mobile Banking developing enhancing Mobile Banking applications adding features
1:37:49
like mobile check deposit all the features you know deposit real time notifications personalized Financial
1:37:55
Services Investment Services managing uh Robo advisory platforms that provide
1:38:01
automated algorithm driven financial planning services with minimum human supervision investment related there are
1:38:08
lot of apps you know investment based service which provides the investment Based Services and all those apps basically they need a product manager
1:38:15
travel you know you know oo make my trip there are lot I think e my trip a lot of
1:38:22
uh profiles are there which are focused which are focused on service based
1:38:27
product management uh what are their roles and responsibilities develop the app you know typically they focus on
1:38:32
loyalty programs designing and managing hotel or Airline loyalty programs ensuring they offer valuable rewards and
1:38:39
experience say that enhances customer loyal loyalty you know when it comes to
1:38:45
make my trip kind of uh platform wherein everything is all about you know how can
1:38:51
you differentiate your travel package so you have they basically these are
1:38:57
marketing tilted product management profiles wherein you have to create more and more personalized travel
1:39:04
packages curating and managing travel packages including flight accommodation experiences ensuring seamless and
1:39:10
enjoyable customer Jing so that kind of perspective they will look at it if you are if you happen to apply on uh travel
1:39:17
on hospit Hospitality based uh product management profiles but again these are examples of service best product
1:39:23
management telecommunication you know again you have product management profiles for
1:39:29
go uh I think most of them are India Mumbai based location Jo PMS I think uh
1:39:38
couple of months back I saw a couple of profiles were available developing and managing internet services packages
1:39:45
including speed uh years pricing additional Services home Wi-Fi you know
1:39:51
Geo now they would like to combine everything thing mobile ftth
1:39:57
geofiber all those things how can you create a big package of the services and who does all those things it's the
1:40:03
product manager so who will look at different different products and then accordingly they will Define the
1:40:10
features Customer Support Services enhancing customer support through chat BS so these are kind of couple of high
1:40:18
level things which product manager will focuses on in in respective industry
1:40:24
similarly I can give example of Education you know uh earlier uh I think
1:40:30
uh Buu had lot of product management profiles but now a days I think BYU is
1:40:36
uh out of business now uh however I think um Udi had product management
1:40:44
profiles wherein the product manager job is uh do the marketing survey look at
1:40:49
what uh what does customer needs look at what competitors are doing and accordingly develop a more customized
1:40:56
online e-learning profiles e-learning courses managing and developing online
1:41:02
courses learning platform ensuring that they they are engaging up toate accessible to White audience and they
1:41:08
also provide focuses on student services overseeing the services such as uh career
1:41:14
counseling academic uh advising mental health support ensuring they effectively
1:41:20
support the Student Success so if you are in educational industry you happen
1:41:26
to work on these are all the key features SAS software as a Services uh
1:41:34
collaboration tools I think one of them what we are going to use work upon today is um tro jira basically atashian
1:41:43
atashian based uh atashian is the organization tro is their tool they develop collaboration tool Microsoft
1:41:49
tools Microsoft also lot of uh product management profiles so teams what we are
1:41:54
going to use today is again their uh one of the product from Microsoft so those falls under SAS category which develops
1:42:02
the collaboration tools again we have CRM tools let's take example of Salesforce enhancing CRM system to
1:42:08
provide better customer insights sales processes improve customer services these are kind of key things in SAS
1:42:15
industry you have product management profiles in um flip cart Amazon
1:42:21
Walmart so what are the things if you happen to work in those Industries e-commerce platforms managing the
1:42:27
development and optimization of online shopping experiences including web design Payment Processing delivery
1:42:33
services so if you happen to get a job profile in Walmart you have to develop a
1:42:39
product which is focusing on ease of payment how can you enhance the delivery
1:42:44
related Services how can you make your UI more and more interactive how can you create more and more loyalty programs
1:42:51
for the end customers subscription Services overseeing subscription Bas models like uh kits Beauty boxes digital
1:42:59
content how can you make a packaged deals for the end
1:43:04
customers so these are the things which happens currently happening in retail industry
1:43:10
transportation I think uh again it is part of go hand in hand with I think uh
1:43:16
travel and Hospitality I would say uh Red Bus they
1:43:22
also had product management profiles uh Uber Ola ride sharing Services they also
1:43:28
have product management profiles managing platforms for ride sharing Services focuses on okay so driver
1:43:35
partner supports have you you you'll create a platform for drivers you will create a platform for end customers and
1:43:41
accordingly you will develop your product at the end you are you are enhancing your transportation service
1:43:49
and you are trying to improve your competitive advantage in that market so these are couple of examples of product
1:43:55
management profiles in service based industry just to give you a glimpse so
1:44:00
we completed till 9 okay so we completed this one now
1:44:06
slide number 12 tips of fers uh tips for freshers or aspiring to become a product
1:44:14
manager not only freshers basically those who are Outsiders the first thing is you should understand you should
1:44:21
learn learn the basic things you should learn the skills and competencies to become a product manager so there this
1:44:28
course will be helpful develop a soft skills along with the core skills you should develop a soft skills third one
1:44:35
is build a portfolio so as a part of this course you will get uh good amount of hands-on experience on different
1:44:42
different um Capstone projects wherein you should be able to work as a product
1:44:48
manager and develop a product Vision document develop a product goto Market strategy
1:44:53
uh given uh customer uh requirement you should be able to prioritize the features if you get a customer feedback
1:45:00
you should be able to assess which featur basically which particular problem customer is facing you should be
1:45:06
able to come up with the kpi so all those case studies we will be able to give it to you as a part of this course expectation is that you will enhance
1:45:13
your resume with reference to those projects what you are doing as a part of this course plus uh at the end of the
1:45:20
course I will be giving you some communi which are specific to product management
1:45:25
expectation from your side is you will join those communities create your network talk to them and uh again as a
1:45:33
part of uh this course I will tell you some freelancing opportunities wherein you can get handson experience on some
1:45:39
live projects from their side apart from what we are going to provide as a part of this course so by doing all those
1:45:46
things what you are trying to do is that you are going to put more and more productive experience on your resume as
1:45:51
a product manager and if you do all those things you are basically enhancing your employability
1:45:58
for product management profiles so that's my answer it could be fresher or
1:46:03
it could be a people from different uh background first one is learn the basics complete the course work to I think just
1:46:10
we are in first module I think uh at least uh 30 40 percentage course work you understand and then start uh because
1:46:18
I think once we complete 30 40 percentage of the course workor you can
1:46:24
start upload updating your resume for example if we complete a product Vision document for couple of products you can
1:46:31
start uploading improving you your adding those those experience in your resume and start looking for
1:46:38
opportunities so first step is gain gain gain those skills so let's try to understand the
Product Manager’s Role in Cross-Functional Teams
1:46:45
roles and responsibility of each of the stakeholder we will get a very clear idea uh I think uh if we go through this
1:46:52
couple of sles so product manager role uh as we discussed it he oversees uh
1:46:58
product life cycle right from ideation to launch ensuring that there is a good alignment between business goals and
1:47:06
customer needs so basically he will understand the customer needs he'll create a product Vision he'll ensure
1:47:13
that uh all things are in place so he is single point of contact for that product right from idation till it it is written
1:47:21
as a launch but actually till uh its retirement so what are the roles and
1:47:26
responsibilities Define product Vision Define product strategy create product road map prioritize the features
1:47:32
collaborate with cross functional teams development design marketing gather and analyze customer feedback market
1:47:39
research track product performance we we call it as a kpi matri uh iterate based on kpi and data
1:47:48
you know you will understand that you'll get the data come up with the kpis based on that you will decide the corrective
1:47:54
action in order to improve the product performance if at all kpis are not on track as defined in product Vision
1:47:59
document and essentially act as a main point of communication between all the stakeholders so all the decisions
1:48:06
related to product will be given by product manager so is the single point of contact for that product product
1:48:12
manager so important stakeholder first important stakeholder or product management
1:48:17
manager is engineering team so what are their roles and responsibilities engineering Dev V mment
1:48:23
team is responsible for building the product and ensuring that it functions technically so what are their
1:48:29
responsibilities develop a code develop and code the product based on technical specification again code is very
1:48:36
specific thing it is specifically I think written for software product
1:48:42
however it is engineering is applicable basically in order to ensure that
1:48:47
product is designed as per the technical specification provide input put on
1:48:53
feasibility timeline and Technical risk so product engineering team typically engineering lead he will work closely
1:49:00
with product manager during Vision PR phase and he will talk he will give information about if the uh features are
1:49:07
technically feasible or not if yes how much timeline is required and what kind of technical risk is
1:49:14
associated collaborate with collaborate with product manager on design and development priorities uh so engineering
1:49:21
team will closely basically engineering is a receiver you know wherein uh they
1:49:28
will understand the feature priorities and accordingly they will come up with a timeline and for approvals they will go to product manager conduct testing bug
1:49:36
fixing ensuring that the product released product is meets the quality
1:49:41
kpis support product iteration and goinging updation U basically and ongoing updates
1:49:47
post launch so support you know iteration one iteration two iteration three
1:49:53
and basically after post production if there are some quality issues you engineering team will support in order
1:49:59
to resolve those quality issues from technical perspective so these are the roles and responsibilities of
1:50:04
engineering team third stakeholder in this whole journey is the design or ux team so again I typically they consider
1:50:12
design or ux team separately as I know with reference to engineering however I
1:50:18
consider if you look at them they fall under engineering domain but again they have specific roles and responsibilities
1:50:25
with reference to UI and ux but again these roles are very much similar they
1:50:30
just there their focus is only on UI development their role is ensuring that the product is user friendly intive and
1:50:37
Visually appealing responsibilities design you know wireframes design
1:50:42
prototypes for UI and ux user interface and user experience conduct usability testing
1:50:48
incorporate feedback into product design so you will have different different
1:50:53
uiux prototypes and then what you do is that you create those prototypes you ask
1:51:00
uh selected end user you know terminology selected end user you
1:51:06
release the UI to them and you ask them okay please utilize it and let us know how do you feel it and based on that
1:51:13
feedback typically those UI themes are getting finalized so they work closely with PM
1:51:20
ensuring uh ensure the design Alliance with the product vision and customer needs and ensure that The Branding and
1:51:26
design guidelines are followed so this is what typically design and US team does it so engineering team also does
1:51:33
the same thing but they do it for overall technical specification perspective and uiu is specifically on
1:51:40
uh user interface and user experience and again if you look at generic product management role you know engineering
1:51:45
role is limited to this one but uh if you look at typical software product manager wherein you are talking about
1:51:51
product as aof Ware app then it comes you know uiux team will have bigger impact that's where you know we have
1:51:57
separate stakeholder called as uiux developer with which product manager need to work closely with so that's the
1:52:04
difference between engineering and UI why U is very important because the
1:52:10
nature of the product most of the product typically what we work is
1:52:15
digital products these are on our screen mobile applications that's where UI is
1:52:21
important aspect when it comes to competitive Advantage so that's where UI
1:52:26
is important okay number fourth one is marketing team okay so what marketing
1:52:32
room does they create uh product messaging marketing strategies and ensure that successful product launches
1:52:39
so they are responsible so they are responsible for basically in the two phases the first phase is capturing the
1:52:46
customer requirement you know they work closely with customers and customers they understand VOC we call it as a
1:52:52
voice of customer and then they uh consolidate vo and then pass on pass
1:52:58
that pass on that information to product manager for creating the features but that is just during the product Vision
1:53:06
finalization or feature finalization however major chunk of marketing team lies during product launches so
1:53:13
marketing strategies developing you know one of the core roles and responsibilities develop go-to Market
1:53:19
strategy how they would like to position the product how they would would like to Brand the product what kind of message
1:53:24
they would like to deliver they'll collaborate marketing team collaborate with product management to understand the product features and customer
1:53:30
pinpoints they will pass on okay this was the first page where they will pass on this information related to customer
1:53:35
voice of customer and customer pinpoints you know if there is a current generation product is already been released so they will understand what
1:53:42
are the customer feedbacks pinpoints are there and they will pass that information to product manager which
1:53:47
product manager ideally they he should enhance uh product features with
1:53:53
reference to Old generation pinpoint areas uh execute promotional campaigns including digital marketing content
1:53:59
creation social media so marketing team is the one who decides which platform in
1:54:04
which product launch will happen whether either physical or digital if it is digital what is the digital media
1:54:10
whether social networking website or some other platform if it is social networking website what kind of social
1:54:16
networking website it's Instagram Facebook LinkedIn again depends upon what kind of target market we are
1:54:22
looking for but all those things will be decided by marketing team track the product performance post launch and
1:54:29
adjust the marketing strategy as needed so they will use you know marketing strategy and they will check how
1:54:35
effective is their marketing strategy so let's say example that uh we are going to talk about it Google analytics Google
1:54:41
analytics is the tool which talks about you know let's say example you have created advertise for your product in
1:54:48
multiple applications you adverti your products in product your launched your product advertise in Facebook also you
1:54:54
launched your product advertise in Instagram also uh Google analytics where
1:55:00
which for which we are going to get hands-on experience in lat portion of this course if you pass on the
1:55:05
information for your uh customer leads it can able to tell how many leads you
1:55:10
got it from Facebook how many leads you got it from Instagram and based on that you can able to decide okay which
1:55:17
platform is more effective and accordingly to decide the future strategies you can make all make use of
1:55:22
of that data based on assessing the performance of existing product platforms product release
1:55:28
platforms so those kpi analysis and all will be done by marketing team product
1:55:34
manager will have the overview however the ground work will be done by marketing team sales teams sales is
1:55:41
basically a selling function uh their role is sell the product to the customer provides insights to customer into the
1:55:48
customer needs and market trends so understand product features benefit to effectively sell the product they will
1:55:54
understand you know top level features they will create uh kind of owner owner product owner document collateral
1:56:00
document and they will use it for selling the product to the End customer
1:56:07
provide feedback to product manager on customer reaction objections and pinpoints since see marketing team is in
1:56:14
general about where does the market going and launching related product launch which is not focused on any of
1:56:20
the customer sales have will have the focus on particular customer or set of customers so that's where you know um
1:56:29
they will customer specific pinpoint information they will give it to us however what feedback typically
1:56:35
marketing team will give you overall marketing marketing Technologies related so you'll get a very generic feedback
1:56:42
from marketing team with when it comes to your product feedback from customer
1:56:47
however you know you'll get specific feedback from sales team because they work day in Day Out on with a with a set
1:56:53
of customers so that's that's the difference between getting the feedback from marketing team and what feedback
1:56:59
you get it from sales team assist in developing product strategies and sales
1:57:05
material presentations demos so they as I told they work closely with customers so they are responsible for giving demos
1:57:12
to the End customer showing the presentations creating the manual documents and all those things support
1:57:17
product launch by driving initial sales and onboarding customers so day also
1:57:23
will be involved in initial sales and onboarding the customers so this is sales team number six customer support
1:57:30
team okay you launch the product you need to have customer support team so they serve as the frontliner for customer issues providing feedback and
1:57:37
support so if there are some issues if customer needs some assistance while using the product they are kind of um
1:57:44
you can say customer support uh numbers most of these guys are call center guys
1:57:51
they are like a front face for the customer issues so they handle customer queries issues feedback report uh
1:57:57
recurring issues customer pain points to the product manager for
1:58:02
product Improvement assist with customer onboarding and training and collaborate
1:58:08
with product manager to create Fu guide and support content for the customers so
1:58:13
they are responsible for typically the usage related issues from end customers
1:58:19
so number four five six is about marketing team on one liner if I say marketing team
1:58:25
responsible for giving input to product manager during Vision document and at the time of launching marketing team is
1:58:31
very much involved during defining the goto Market strategy sales team
1:58:36
responsible for selling your product to End customer they will closely work with End customer and uh they will sell the
1:58:43
product they will show the demo sell the product all the selling related transactions Financial entries they are
1:58:50
responsible and customer support team once the product is sold if there are any issues with reference to customer
1:58:56
use sorry product usage and feedback they are the front face for the customers any questions 4 five six it's
1:59:04
very important that you understand uh overall stakeholders and what they do
1:59:10
and touch points with reference to product managers 789 uh seventh one is finance team so it's our finance
1:59:17
organization what what role they play oversee the product Financial viability budgeting and pricing strategies
1:59:24
responsibilities ensure that the product aligns the financial goals and objectives assist in setting the product
1:59:30
pricing models and revenue forecast uh Monitor and analyze financial performance cost Revenue
1:59:37
margins post launch and advise the product a product manager on profitability and Financial Risk
1:59:45
so uh the thing is uh during Vision product
1:59:50
manager will closely work with with financial team they can product manager will closely work with financial team in
1:59:56
order to uh Define what kind of financial forecast is expected so
2:00:03
basically um when it comes to pricing the product product manager will closely work with Finance team what kind of
2:00:09
pricing methodology we would like to use what kind of margins we should expect while selling the product to the
2:00:15
customer and uh so defining the product pricing product manager will work closely with Finance team and and uh you
2:00:22
know Revenue numbers product manager will get it from Finance team so finance will have overall information about your
2:00:28
customer install base how many customers are there uh product manager will work closely once in a month at least uh he
2:00:34
will get the revenue information from Finance team and with the help of those data analytics toolbox what we are going
2:00:40
to use it product manager will check okay how well product is performing
2:00:45
financially and are we meeting the financial related kpis or not if not you will collaborate with Finance team and
2:00:51
come up with the corrective action so monitoring cost Revenue margin Financial
2:00:57
kpis all those things product manager will work closely with Finance team and as I told during pricing Finance is very
2:01:04
very important stakeholder for product manager so which type which methodology of PR pricing methodology to be used a
2:01:10
product manager will close the work with the financial team and at the beginning overall you know what is overall budget
2:01:18
required how much Budget Finance team can able to allocate so during Vision finalization also product manager will
2:01:24
give will will work with Finance team in order to get the buying from Finance team that okay this product will make
2:01:30
Financial sense for example product manager will say return on investment is 30% Finance team will have the overall
2:01:37
objective about what company looks after what company is looking for uh the
2:01:43
financial success from this product so product manager will work closly with Finance team in order to understand the
2:01:48
expectation from Finance what is the ROI Finance team is expecting from the from
2:01:53
the product in order to capture those details in Vision document so financing
2:01:58
Lian and compliance team okay ensure that product is compliant with reference to relevant regulations and policies
2:02:06
review the product for compliance with industry standards regulations assis in
2:02:12
IP protection such as patent trademarks review contracts terms and services
2:02:17
contracts terms of services primary policies protect the company assist
2:02:23
product management on legal risk and necessity necessary certifications certificates basically
2:02:29
sorry certificates so all legal related things you know you will closely work
2:02:34
with the legal team another use case you know wherein product manager will closely work with legal team is that you
2:02:40
have uh a generation one product is launched in one particular geography now
2:02:45
you would like to customize it little bit and you would like to launch that U customized product in geography to but
2:02:53
here you will closely work with legal team and you will ask okay what kind of um government related regulations are
2:02:58
there in New geography which needs to be incorporated in order to launch the product in that geography so accordingly
2:03:04
legal team will do that survey they will understand all the things from legal perspective and they will pass that
2:03:10
information to product manager and then product manager will uh work with engineering team in order to make that
2:03:15
customization on that product so anything related to Legal te uh legal team is your stakeholder go work with
2:03:22
them so this is about um product penetration into new geography wherein
2:03:28
legal team will come into the picture one use case Second Use case intellectual property so whenever you
2:03:34
feel that you have developed a novel approach to solve the customer problem product manager will closely work with
2:03:39
legal team to understand what kind of Ip protection needs to be incorporated whether we need to we need to file a
2:03:45
patent whether we need to file a design protection so there are multiple types of intellectual property patent is just
2:03:50
one I think mostly people knows only about patent but uh we have white paper we have uh patent we
2:03:58
have design what they call it as a okay I forgot the name there are multiple I
2:04:06
think things I am just forgetting the names so I prent is just one one part of it so design protection DP so DP is also
2:04:14
there so which category this IP novelty will fall into and accordingly the documentation related things will Legal
2:04:21
team will take care so product manager will work closely with legal team so that is use case number two and the third case is that for example typically
2:04:28
in let's take example you work in a B2B segment you have decided to work with a
2:04:33
to acquire a new customer in that case for all the contracts creating the contracts writing those legal things
2:04:40
getting the sign off from different different people you will closely work with legal team in order to create that
2:04:46
legal documentation so you should know a little bit about legalities Al also you
2:04:52
should be able to ask right questions to Legal team number nine executive and leadership team provide strategic
2:04:58
directions and approve the major product development product decisions as I told Vision product Vision document you will
2:05:04
create it but at the end execu your leadership team is the one who will approve that Vision document so ensures
2:05:10
that product aligns the company's overall vision and business strategy so this is the responsibility of leadership
2:05:15
team so by considering this Clause they will either approve your vision document or they will ask you to make some
2:05:22
modifications approve product major product investment including budget resources and timeline so product
2:05:27
manager as I told initially he will consolidate all the budget related things into product Vision document but
2:05:33
it's the leadership team who will approve that budget offer feedback and guidelines to product priorities and
2:05:39
Market positioning again they he will leadership team will assess your plan and accordingly he will provide the
2:05:45
guidance to product managers holds PM accountable for product performance and business outcomes monthly you will have
2:05:51
review with ex EX Team if you are working as a product manager you have to present your product related things kpis
2:05:58
related things once in a month to executive team wherein you will be telling showing them different different kpis how your product is performing what
2:06:06
kind of feedback you are getting it from customer side and if things are not going well as per the KPS defined in
2:06:12
product Vision document you have to give them a solid plan by which this is the
2:06:17
mitigation plan and this is the corrective action I'm basically Pro in this particular way particular way to
2:06:23
address the customer issues so that kind of justification you need to give you but you are answerable to you as a
2:06:28
product manager you are answerable to executive and leadership team if you look at other stakeholders
2:06:35
they are your customers so they are your your work is to get the work done from their side but at the end you need to
2:06:43
sell your product to executive team so very very important number nine Finance
2:06:49
legal executive any questions guys we have three more okay number 10
2:06:56
customers users again you you will have you as a product manager you will have interaction with customers or users
2:07:02
either through marketing team or through sales and accounts management
2:07:08
team uh sometimes you can directly get involved into you know customer survey
2:07:14
sometimes you know they will ask you to uh join the customer service uh but
2:07:19
customer is another important stakeholder for you uh most of the cases the interaction with customer happens
2:07:26
via marketing team or sales team role of customers or end users is ensure end users of the product who needs the
2:07:33
feedback shape the product success so why they are important because uh they are End customer they are going to buy
2:07:40
your product but when it comes to product development uh you will have a set of U selected customers so with
2:07:47
which you ask them okay use these prototypes use this uh a version of a product and give us the feedback so
2:07:53
that's where you know you have those selected customers and they will be responsible to provide the feedback
2:07:59
through surveys interviews or direct usage share the pinpoints desired features user experience uh challenges
2:08:06
with product management adopt the adopt and use product influence the product uh
2:08:12
future product iterations based on Behavior and the feedback so customers I
2:08:18
think there are two categories one is actual and customers and second one is ected customers a selected customers
2:08:23
company uses it for uh deciding the getting the quick feedback about the
2:08:29
prototypes and which design options to take it forward and but the end
2:08:34
customers essentially you will get U uh feedback from the end customers about you know you go to Google reviews and
2:08:40
all you'll get good amount of feedback and uh that feedback you will use it to iterate Next Generation product 11th one
2:08:48
uh suppliers or Partners mostly you know when you have Hardware product this is
2:08:53
one of the stakeholders majorly you know suppliers or Partners basically they provide resources material or external
2:09:00
Services required for product development in software also you know you who are all your suppliers when it
2:09:06
comes to uh software product third party licenses you know whatever
2:09:13
infrastructural things what they use in order to the product development they are your suppliers for example you use
2:09:20
uh cloud from somebody else you use uh CRM software from sales Salesforce so
2:09:26
these are your suppliers uh last one operations team again it very much focused on Hardware
2:09:33
you know when you are to manufacture product so you the role is ensure the smooth operation of processes Logistics
2:09:39
and product development delivery and support uh oversee production schedule
2:09:45
ensure time to delivery of physical products so they are responsible for ensuring that uh so and so production go
2:09:51
on smoothly you have you are meeting the production related targets with proper quality manage supply chain Logistics
2:09:57
inventory quality control where they will collaborate with product management uh collaborate with
2:10:03
product management for forecast demand align with operational capacity so product manager so they are kind of
2:10:08
dependent upon dependent on product managers in order to get the forecast related information ensure the scalability and
2:10:15
efficiency of a processes for product roll outs so product manager should ask
2:10:21
ask operations team write questions about are are our operations expenses are optimized or
2:10:26
not or is there any room for improvement so Improvement Implement um
2:10:34
continu continuous Improvement strategies to optimize the operations and reduce the cost so they typically
2:10:40
look for CIP projects in order to reduce the operation cost and the touch point
2:10:45
with product management is a forecasting and uh once in a quarter you will have
2:10:51
interaction with operations team to check how is your operations are
2:10:56
optimized or not or is there any room for improvement because if you reduce the operation related cost overall cost
2:11:01
for your product is getting reduced and that will give additional revenue for your organization yes so these are these 12
2:11:09
stakeholders and I think based on my experience if you go
2:11:15
to any organization you I think all the stakeholders are captured over here with
2:11:20
which product manager will work closely with moduel one is all about understanding
2:11:26
the product management roles and responsibilities what he does and what
2:11:32
other guys do so this this this point is about what other guys are doing PM
2:11:38
engineering uiux Marketing sales customer support Finance legal
2:11:43
leadership customers and customers suppliers Partners operations yeah so I think we we did
2:11:50
covered in slide number eight uh associate product manager typically associate product manager he he is kind
2:11:58
of uh uh dotted line reporting to product manager so product manager will delegate
2:12:03
couple of tasks to associate product manager and he's helping the primary product manager so that's his role so
2:12:10
assisting in gathering and documenting the product requirement conducting market research competitor analysis
2:12:16
supporting product manager in road map development prioritization collaborative development team on minor feature enhancement
2:12:23
learning the fundamentals of product management through mentorship and handson experience so some work of
2:12:29
product manager he will delegate to APM it might be from marketing side it might be from engineering side it might be
2:12:35
from operation side it might be from sales side so APM based on that particular assignment he will work
2:12:41
closely with uh one of those 12 stakeholders as we mentioned and then
2:12:46
whatever roles SI I basically explained that this task he needs to do it
2:12:51
good yeah so these are the you know different different CFS so that's where you know I told you like uh if you let's
2:12:58
go back to our core skills skills for a product manager the the point at which we start you know you have to be very
2:13:05
good in stakeholder management communication since you are working with multiple stakeholders you should be able
2:13:10
to talk to their talk in their language articulate the things talk to
2:13:16
them get their buying because you have to work with multiple people and and that's what it
2:13:22
makes product management profile very attractive because it's very critical role and if you look at you know the
2:13:28
kind of roles and responsibilities product manager does do you think even artificial intelligence can able to
2:13:34
replace product manager very very difficult things are very complex it is not defined in a straight uh way which
2:13:43
which you can able to code it and replace it so that's what product management profile is very very
2:13:50
unique and important so I would say okay the success of your product how
2:13:57
much you are basically what assessment you need to do it with reference to your existing data of your current geography
2:14:03
how much uiux will contribute in order to uh basically for contributing to
2:14:09
success of your product in geography one is it very important is it good to have or is it okay not not not much important
2:14:17
typically based on my experience I would like to share you know my experience also when we say you know people are
2:14:23
pushing they are in hurry but when actually you go with a proposal that okay I see this risk are you okay could
2:14:30
you please give me in writing that you are okay with this risk and uh you are align you are okay to take this risk
2:14:36
nobody will give you in writing that okay they are okay with this risk it just we don't put the things on paper
2:14:42
just don't we don't go and professionally explain the things you know the things which are not going good
2:14:47
in the organization that's why things are happening I would say so if you go with proper documentation uh you can
2:14:54
able to convince people that's what I learned in my product management career yeah there will be stakeholders in your
2:15:01
organization who can support you with proper data I think all your questions will be answered by or whatever data is
2:15:07
required to put that justification you can work with marketing team give me the details about what kind of opportunities
2:15:13
you see in geography one geography to geography 3 give me the customer preference in this geography based on
2:15:20
that where to launch what to launch you can able to decide and how to launch um
2:15:25
you know you can use your you can ask them to come up with the proposals and you can use your historical information
2:15:31
where and all historically you have launched the product and was it been considered as a success or failure based
2:15:36
on that you can have some some assumptions on how to launch and think
2:15:41
most of the B and in most of the I would say some of the PMS also they don't know the details about these T
2:15:48
stakeholders sometimes problem comes and they they are just clueless you know they don't know how to solve the
2:15:53
problems but if you know the is r and r of each of the stakeholders who are all
2:15:59
your Cas key stakeholders and what is their roles and responsibilities if you ask right questions they are answerable
2:16:05
you know just it's up to us how how rightly we ask them the question just a

the first step towards career growth in the field of product management number 11 best practices in product
Best Practices in Product Management
2:16:54
management okay so what are the best practices in product management so the first one is uh develop a clear product
2:17:01
vision and strategy why it is important ideally see best practices in product management ideally this this portion
2:17:06
should have been at the in the final module you know where in we are talking about best practices but uh since they
2:17:13
have included in the beginning uh we will just have a touch based upon you know all the best practices but if you
2:17:19
did not understood one particular Point feel free to raise your hand I can further elaborate
2:17:25
typically you know since I told that product vision is the backbone of the product so and the product manager is
2:17:31
kind of um uh owner of product Vision document even though he has to get alignment from different different
2:17:38
stakeholders it is expected that you know product Vision should be very clear and uh uh product strategy also should
2:17:44
be very very clear why it is important a well- defined product Vision acts like uh you know North
2:17:51
star uh guiding all the decisions related to product development a clear well defined instead of well defined
2:17:58
well researched and well- defined product uh Vision document will will sort out lot of issues in during the
2:18:05
product development phase you know if you have very clear product Vision document create a clear product Vision
2:18:11
that aligns with company company's overall vision and mission strategy breakdown Vision into shortterm and
2:18:17
long-term goals you know that does mean that okay when we go for document you will understand shortterm we are
2:18:23
basically expecting that how product is expected to perform in short term and shortterm is basically anything in less
2:18:30
than three years so you will you are you as a product manager you are supposed to put all those short-term goals for a
2:18:36
product and long-term goals for your product in the product Vision document so that's where you have to do a
2:18:42
detailed research and then you should put a realistic numbers uh Break Down The Vision into
2:18:48
short-term and long-term goals that can be easily and real istically achieved ensure all stakeholders understand and
2:18:54
align with the product Vision to prevent confusion and conflicting priorities uh another point I would like to tell based
2:19:01
on my examp my experience is basically once you have a Clear Vision document most of the conflicts you can able to
2:19:07
resolve what you just need to do is that you have to just refer the vision document and if there are any conflicts between marketing team engineering team
2:19:13
Finance team you just try understand their issues and then go to refer the product Vision document what has been
2:19:19
aligned at the beginning of of the project and with reference to Vision document you can able to resolve maximum
2:19:24
number of conflicts between different different stakeholders so that's where you know you should have very comprehensive clear and well defined
2:19:32
well researched Vision document so that is one of the primary responsibility of product manager and it is one of the
2:19:38
best practices is have a very clear Vision document second point a customer Centric approach why it is important
2:19:45
because uh product success is ultimately determined by uh you know whether
2:19:50
customer likes your product or not if they like it they will buy it otherwise they will not buy it so always focus on
2:19:57
what does customer what customer looks what kind of customer needs you are trying to fulfill with your product so
2:20:03
always have that customer Centric approach when you are defining product Vision document when you are you know
2:20:08
doing all the problem solving when you are doing any activity just try to be more empathetic towards u customer side
2:20:17
and based on that you should look at the problem and then you should try to resolve it best practices how to get that customer
2:20:23
Centric approach conduct thorough user research to understand customer pinpoints preferences and customer
2:20:30
behaviors and uh product managers uses different types of tools like a customer Persona Journey Maps you you go to
2:20:39
different different customer interviews to keep the customer at the center of the product strategy so always strategy
2:20:45
should rolve all around customer and it's not only that uh you you get this
2:20:51
data at the beginning of the product development but also you should have the regular touch point with the End
2:20:58
customer before product at before starting the product development you know once you create the
2:21:05
prototypes and you would like to know which prototype is better so that you can decide that prot you can finalize
2:21:12
that prototype design for further product development process again go for selected customers and ask them to use
2:21:19
that um prototype and accordingly you can finalize so it is called as AB
2:21:24
testing so always be in contact with End customer and uh based on actual data all
2:21:31
the decisions you should be able to make it customer Centric approach third one
2:21:37
is prioritize effectively uh we also discussed yesterday we had a detailed discussion
2:21:42
about budgeting related constraints which has uh overall budget resource related constraints time related
2:21:48
constraints so here that's what it talks about prioritization why it is important resources and times are always limited
2:21:55
so prioritize the right features and initiatives initiative is the key of delivering maximum
2:22:01
value so how product manager does it so there are different different Frameworks product manager uses so one of the just
2:22:09
to give the methodology or first framework is rice which talks about reach impact confidence and efforts so
2:22:18
and then second one is Moscow must have should have could have won't have so these are the way in which you can able
2:22:25
to put all the features and accordingly you can put some numbers you know out of
2:22:30
10 what is if I implement this feature what kind of um reach I'm going to get
2:22:37
if I implement this feature what kind of impact I'm going to get on the product level or is it going to impact you know
2:22:43
the confidence of and customer on my product what kind of efforts are required in order to implement that
2:22:48
feature so again like think in subsequent model we will have detailed uh and experience on all those
2:22:54
Frameworks but essentially prioritization is one of the key activity by product manager and product
2:23:01
manager will use these kind of Frameworks in order to uh data
2:23:07
driven basically he he will use this Frameworks in order to come up with the right priority which is backed by solid
2:23:13
data and rice and mosow are just couple of Frameworks align prioritization with uh
2:23:20
business goals and customer impact rather than building every feature what
2:23:25
the customer has requested uh communicate prioritize clearly with proper justification to
2:23:31
stakeholders to manage expectation and basically maintain the focus so you might get you know
2:23:39
different different customer requirements but that does not mean that all requirements you should be capturing in your product features you should only
2:23:46
capture those features which are must have on a top priority still if you have
2:23:52
resources then you should go for should have still if you have liage then you should go for could have so this
2:24:00
Frameworks will basically very very useful in order to make those decisions so prioritization is the key number four
2:24:07
focus on cfts cross functional collaboration why it is important product management is
2:24:13
inherently cross functional work you know which involves collaboration with engineering design Marketing sales and
2:24:20
other teams yesterday what we discussed those 16 um stakeholders including product
2:24:26
management so 15 basically so it is product management responsibility to
2:24:32
lead those CFT meetings so he should focus on how to make those CFT discussions more and more productive so
2:24:40
what does that mean how he's going to what are the best practices in order to um make sure that these things is
2:24:46
captured the first best practice is establish a clear line of communication with all teams ensure that everyone
2:24:53
understands their roles and responsibilities uh facilitate regular
2:24:58
cross functional meetings like uh Sprint board Sprint planning um retrospective and Views to
2:25:07
Foster alignment uh Foster culture of collaboration where all teams feel valued and heard in the decision- making
2:25:14
process so you should make sure that the environment in the CFT is that everybody
2:25:20
would like like to participate and if there are issues everybody should feel free to bring
2:25:26
those issues on the table so that there will be a productive discussion so that's the one of the best practice what
2:25:32
product manager should follow CF leading and CF management adopt agile
2:25:37
methodologies why it is important you know everybody knows agile is far better than
2:25:43
waterfall way of product development it has its own advantages so agile product
2:25:48
management emphasizes flexib ility it goes flexibility speed iterative development making it ideal for today's
2:25:56
fastpaced market uh best practices agile is all
2:26:02
about breaking down the product development into different different Sprints and uh release minimum basically
2:26:08
for each Sprint there each Sprint there could there will be a MVP and uh basically it will be release to uh
2:26:15
selected customers and we will ask uh customer feedback to learn quickly
2:26:21
emphasizes continuous Improvement through multiple iterations based on feedback and performance data and uh we
2:26:30
use tools like uh jira scrum Canan to track the pro progress manage workflows
2:26:36
and make adjustment if needed so best practices is go for agile methodology I
2:26:44
think hardly I I don't see anybody I think typically use nowadays waterfall
2:26:49
based meth ology I think everybody has already shifted to aile methodology wherein overall work is divided into
2:26:55
different different Sprints and product development for each of the Sprints most of the Sprints will happen parallely
2:27:02
instead of sequentially so that was about Point number five point number six very very
2:27:09
important yesterday also we discussed leverage data for decision making why it is important data provides valuable
2:27:16
insights into how products are being used and helps identify areas for improvement so set up a kpis key
2:27:23
performance indicators to measure the success of your product you know it could be user engagement customer
2:27:29
retention Revenue growth we will have detailed module about all those what are
2:27:34
the different KPS product manager will work with uh use AB testing customer analytics and
2:27:42
usage metrics to make informed decisions and validate hypothesis best feature
2:27:49
development and product iteration on data rather than intution or assumptions
2:27:54
so always you know whatever decisions you make it should be based on data you should not think that uh you should not
2:28:01
make a decision on subjective analysis always it should be based on objective assessment so that's the key and uh as
2:28:09
we told one of the skills for product management is you should be able to good with numbers when you see the numbers
2:28:15
you should quickly able to compute the kpis it could be user engagement related kpis it could be Revenue growth related
2:28:22
kpis it could be Financial kpis quality related kpis so always uh use the data
2:28:28
to make informed decisions because you are answerable to success of your
2:28:34
product if product is not performing well you are basically answerable to why
2:28:39
did you make that decision at that time you should be able to justify what data you have used in order to make that
2:28:46
decision number seven effective Road mapping why it is important product road map uh gives stakeholder a high level
2:28:53
view of the product Direction and the key Milestone best practice is uh build a
2:28:58
flexible road map uh I would say instead of flexible you should better word here
2:29:04
is adaptable road map that outlines the product goal features and timeline while
2:29:10
leaving the room for adjustment based on the feedback and Market changes most of the time it happens that you know you
2:29:15
start product development and things will get changed things will change over a period of time at that time your road
2:29:21
map should be flexible enough adaptable enough so that you can able to adjust it
2:29:26
with reference to the market changes or basically if customer um expectation got
2:29:32
changed over a period of time you should be able to accommodate those changes so you should add buffer
2:29:38
basically at for each each step buffer should not be so high buffer should not
2:29:44
be uh too low also clearly differentiate between short-term technical goals and
2:29:49
longterm strategic objectives and initiatives regularly update and communicate road map to all stakeholders
2:29:58
ensuring everyone is aligned so again alignment is uh what we discussed previously also stakeholder alignment is
2:30:05
important however here Road mapping put clear up basically the expectation best
2:30:10
practices is best practices document a proper road map
2:30:15
which should be flexible enough adaptable enough in order to capture those ch es road map should clearly
2:30:22
include what are your short-term goals uh what are your long-term goals and uh
2:30:27
you should regularly visit those road maps and if there are any changes basically adjust the road map
2:30:34
accordingly number eight be a strong Communicator why it is important uh PM needs to ensure that all stakeholders
2:30:40
both internal and external are informed and align with the product goals and
2:30:46
decisions um maintain open Communication channel with cross functional teams ensure that ensure Clarity on priorities
2:30:54
goals and progress practice active listening to understand concerns and
2:31:00
feedback from both uh stakeholders and customers use tools like uh
2:31:05
presentations reports dashboard to keep the leadership team and customer update
2:31:10
updated on the product progress very very important dashboard I you know in
2:31:16
last three years I developed almost three to five dashboards which were not previously present in my organization so
2:31:24
people like dashboards you know people like uh a single slide which talks about
2:31:29
different different kpis which will give overview about how exactly product is doing it could be for one product it
2:31:36
could be for um a group of product or it could be for overall product line so
2:31:41
always think in that particular perspective um be a good communicator communication is not only
2:31:48
about uh verbal ability how good English you have you know you should be you
2:31:54
should be able to convey the message that's the zist basically and uh it could be verbal it could be return it
2:32:01
could be visual also so try to be very crisp and clear you
2:32:07
should not uh give less information you should not give too much information also so you just have to balance what
2:32:15
are the things you are going to communicate so be a good communicator and these things will come over practice you
2:32:22
know okay last two uh manage risk and dependencies yeah this is what we discussed I think uh uh what's important
2:32:29
product development involves risk it could be technical risk it could be Market risk it could be resource related risk and dependencies that needs to be
2:32:36
managed very proactively identify a potential risk early on and create a contingency plan to mitigate them uh
2:32:44
track uh external dependencies it could be a third- party integration partner collaboration
2:32:50
we ensure timelines are not uh Disturbed communicate risk and
2:32:56
mitigation strategies to stakeholders transparently to maintain uh trust so
2:33:02
have very clear communication transparent communication you know if things are not uh going well highlight
2:33:09
those things on your dashboard so that you give that proper visibility that okay this particular area things are not
2:33:16
on track it needs further attention so don't hide in issues and I think with
2:33:21
that able with that kind of clear communication you should be able to manage those risk and have clear
2:33:28
mitigation plan on all the risk and number 10 is about continuous learning
2:33:33
and adoption adaptation basically that's what we discussed uh over a period of time you'll get a good amount of
2:33:39
hands-on experience so you have to learn continuously you will make mistakes uh but uh learn from it and try to
2:33:45
improvise yourself in next iteration the product landscape evolv very quickly and PM needs to be
2:33:53
adaptable to remain competitive so if things got changed be adaptive if you make a mistake accept it move ahead keep
2:34:01
up with industry stands new technologies and Market changes that could impact your product or business Foster a
2:34:08
culture of continuous learning within the team encouraging Innovation and Improvement encourage uh uh
2:34:15
retrospective after Sprints basically encourage feedback kind of session you should not only discuss about things
2:34:22
went well you should also openly discuss about things did not went well and
2:34:28
uh discuss about your failures in team meetings and based on that you can able
2:34:33
to improvise yourself in the next iteration so these are uh best practices
2:34:39
I think if you follow not only about uh specific to product management I think last two these are in general applicable
2:34:46
to I think most of your Prof your profiles also so if you follow I think you'll be able to deliver better value
2:34:53
to your organization so next topic is what are the different tools product manager uses in different phases of uh
Tools for Product Management
2:35:01
product development I think we have and then followed by that we have a demo on
2:35:08
Trello okay so tools for product managers I think we have 11 categories
2:35:16
the first category is what tools product what what are the tools you know which are kind of famous when for product Road
2:35:22
mapping applications or planning tools basically aha product plan Road monk uh
2:35:30
monday.com I think these are different different tools but I'll just
2:35:35
tell AA is very famous a comprehensive Road mapping tool that helps with a
2:35:40
strategy release and ideas and um in fact jira is also there um atashian jira
2:35:47
they they also in in J we can create a very good product road map and we have
2:35:53
you know another tool Microsoft uh project planner here also you can create a proper road map and in jira we will
2:36:00
create a product road map but you just have to know what are the other tools which are wi for product Road mapping uh
2:36:09
second point is project management and task tracking tools again it is uh overall you know it is project
2:36:14
management tool is jira and uh Road mapping is one of the feature so jira is a tool for managing task overall project
2:36:22
management so here you can assign the task especially in agile teams you can create uh Sprint planning task
2:36:30
assignment issue tracking all those things are you can do it in jira uh again I think there is one more
2:36:37
called as tro same from atashian a simple visual task management tool with
2:36:42
for which I think we will have boards list and cards for organizing task so today we will have a Hands-On session on
2:36:50
tro uh but from overall project management perspective jir is better uh individual you know task management a
2:36:57
small projects you can able to do it in tro overall project management tool is jira tro is considered as you know a
2:37:04
task tracking tool very very simple and small projects you can able to manage very well in trone collaboration Tool uh
2:37:12
you know Microsoft teams one of the well-known collaboration tool we can use slack we can use Confluence we can use
2:37:19
use Myro there are multiple tools uh mostly most of the industries they go for Microsoft
2:37:25
teams prototyping I think uh in prototyping also you can create U UI
2:37:31
prototypes by using figma we have collaboration Microsoft teams we
2:37:38
are using project management uh J and Trello and Road mapping also we are
2:37:43
going to use J next one is uh customer feedback and user research so as you
2:37:49
know that product manager you'll closely work with the marketing team in order to develop those surve things uh marketing
2:37:56
survey customer survey yeah so customer feedback and user research tools so Survey Monkey we
2:38:04
have typically we go for Google forms very very easy to use but also Survey Monkey is very popular survey tool for
2:38:10
Gathering the user feedback and insights again there are couple of more platforms like a type form user testing altrix a
2:38:18
tool used for conducting customer research including surveys and customer experience data collection there are
2:38:24
some more platforms but we we will go for Google forms or survey Mony analytics and Data Tracking tools uh as
2:38:33
I told uh for uh you know how well your uiux is doing from that perspective we
2:38:41
will will use Google analytics as a part of this course we will have handson session on Google analytics however we
2:38:46
will have detailed session on Microsoft Excel how to do a data analytics uh in Microsoft Excel but we can again there
2:38:54
are couple of more tools like we for data visualization we can go for powerbi also I can show some examples in powerbi
2:39:02
we have uh one more famous tool is there what is that for data
2:39:08
visualization AEL development uh I think jir is very very famous widely being
2:39:13
used across all the industries so we'll go for atlach and jira and we will have detailed uh uh Hands-On exercise on how
2:39:22
to create a project in jira how to add the different different te members how to create a project planning how to
2:39:28
assign the task how to comment on a task how to assign the statuses how to log the bugs basically
2:39:36
issues tracking the issues all those things we'll try to understand when we discuss about a development tools uh
2:39:42
which tool is used in B2B products analytics uh for
2:39:47
B2B I think most see it is um most of the organizations are moving towards
2:39:53
powerbi so if it is a global organization high probability is that it
2:39:59
is it will be using powerbi or t people use Google analytics also and
2:40:07
if not then I think Microsoft Excel is widely being used if it is a SAS
2:40:13
products I think um Google analytics powerbi these are the
2:40:20
widely being used tools irrespective of whether it is B2B or b2c because it it
2:40:26
has a great capability of analyzing the data whether it is a business to business domain or business to customer
2:40:32
doesn't doesn't matter yeah so aile we discussed uh CRM I think CRM we know
2:40:38
Salesforce is kind of uh uh has a dominant market share most of the people
2:40:44
are using Salesforce based tools for customer relationship management but my organ ization use sap based tool for CRM
2:40:52
again it varies but Salesforce is very famous name uh future management and
2:40:57
experimentation Tool uh these tools allow pm to test the new features run experiments and roll out the features
2:41:04
gradually uh lunch directly optimize a tool for a testing
2:41:09
and experimentation to improve user experience and optimize the product
2:41:15
performance split iio feature management platform that help helps with the
2:41:20
controlled features roll out and AB testing again most of the times AB testing uh we do it you know
2:41:28
inigma or you know working prototype I I hardly used any of these tools for feature management product
2:41:36
feedback you know again we get a feedback from Google form Survey Monkey but again there are couple of product
2:41:42
boards AA ideas scanny these are I think uh products which are specifically
2:41:47
focused on getting the end customer feedback and creating a road map for
2:41:53
road map management application uh documentation we use documentation basically Microsoft based tools uh some
2:42:00
people started using Google Docs Google ppts and all those things because it has its own feature cloud-based application
2:42:07
but nowadays Microsoft also has cloudbased cloud-based products so we can use any of the tools but this is
2:42:13
just overall Glimpse what are the different categories of a tool and then what are the famous Tools in that
2:42:19
category Road mapping product management collaboration prototyping customer
2:42:24
feedback analytics uh agile methodology customer relationship uh feature
2:42:31
management product feedback documentation so among this one I think
2:42:37
I have told which tools for which we are going to have handson experience we'll have handson experience for jira we'll
2:42:43
have it for Trello we'll have it for figma we will have it for uh
2:42:49
Google analytics we will have it for Survey Monkey Google forms and um that's
2:42:57
it for your final presentation you can use Google Docs or you can use Microsoft
2:43:02
uh PowerPoint also it's up to you okay so tools are completed now let's go in
Tool Demo: Trello
2:43:09
detail about tro so tro tro is highly Visual and intutive product project
2:43:15
management tool that helps individuals and teams to organize task
2:43:20
uh track the progress and collaborate effectively basically it is based on kban methodology where task are uh moved
2:43:28
from one stage to another stage it could be to-do list then after to list it is in
2:43:36
progress after in progress it is done so this is called as Canan methodology wherein the overall task is divided into
2:43:42
multiple categories so task can be a to do task once you start working on it it
2:43:48
falls in progress task and once you complete it it is basically completed or done task this is Canan methodology and
2:43:55
Traer tool basically follows this conver methodology and it has a very good visual representation so and again it is
2:44:03
free of cost so that's why tro is a very common tool tro is used for everything
2:44:10
from person to-do list to uh list large scale team projects due to it Simplicity
2:44:17
and flexibility it's very very simple as I think uh once we go to actual demo you'll understand very good visual
2:44:24
representation very easy to use it you can able to learn in 15 minutes if you don't have previous exposure what are
2:44:31
the use cases of tro uh project management you know and track progress assigned task ensure deadline submit you
2:44:38
can able to do this one product development use tro for Agile development Sprints managing backlogs
2:44:45
again tro is from atashian J is also from atashian so you can able to have
2:44:51
connection between tro and jira so that you can if something is jira wherein you
2:44:56
made a overall project plan and some task is in tro you can able to connect those task and bring those two tools in
2:45:04
sync and accordingly you can able to track the overall product development which Sprint that task is
2:45:11
basically mentioned and then how is that task what's the deadline who wants that task how to manage the backlogs that's
2:45:18
where we are going we are using this product trailer tool event planning you know organized task vendors timelines
2:45:26
you can able to easily do it personal productivity in fact not related for
2:45:31
overall team development but overall your day-to-day open task also you can able to represent very clearly in Trello
2:45:38
I use uh Microsoft Excel or you know one note but it is not automative in tro you
2:45:44
can have a lot of automation options like you can create a deadline you will
2:45:50
get alarms you can able to sync it with different different other tools so
2:45:56
that's the uh benefit of tro for personal productivity also you should be able to use the tro content creation use
2:46:03
tro to plan create and schedule content for marketing teams so content creation
2:46:09
also people use the tro uh let's try to understand the top level features of a tro before we go for
2:46:16
actual Hands-On session so so you should know three terminologies one is boards
2:46:22
list and cards so boards what is boards trailers's primary structure is the board so I would say the homepage of a
2:46:29
TR is called as a board or your uh each project will have its own board so which
2:46:34
represents the project or workflow each board contains uh list and card that help organize task and stages so let's
2:46:43
take uh this course Advanced product project management it's if you want to a
2:46:49
timeline for this course you will create a one project in Trello and the homepage of that Trello is called as a board so
2:46:56
you have board for this course then second one is list list represents the
2:47:01
stages of a project or categories of a task common list includes to-do in
2:47:07
progress done but the list can be customized which will be suited for
2:47:13
different workflows it could be a backlog it could be review you can rename based on your use case so list
2:47:18
basically the categories different different categories within that board and cards cards basically represent the
2:47:25
individual task within that list a user can add uh
2:47:31
description due dates they can label it they can add attachment they can add
2:47:37
divide that you know activity into small small steps and they can use the checklist and uh comments into they can
2:47:45
add comments into the card so they it it will make it more collaborative making
2:47:51
them powerful powerful way to manage the detailed work so this is cards boats
2:47:57
list and cards these are the three terminologies checklist I told you basically each card each activity can be
2:48:05
further divided into small small task and then you can use that checklist for to break the break even that big big
2:48:11
activity into small small task within cards user can add checklist to break down the task into smaller steps this
2:48:18
helps to track the progress and more complex task or subtasks so each task can be divided into multiple subtask and
2:48:24
then you have checklist so visually you can check how many tasks are completed how many tasks are pending labels uh
2:48:31
labels allow users to categorize task By Priority type or any other criteria labels can be color coded making it easy
2:48:38
to Vis identify a specific type of task uh label you know you can see a red
2:48:46
yellow uh green you can put label and Visually it should be able to represent so high priority medium priority low
2:48:52
priority you can use customize the level based on your application due dates and
2:48:58
reminders you know for each task each cards I would say uh you have due dates
2:49:03
you can able to put it on the cards notification and reminders can be configured to alert users when deadlines
2:49:09
are approaching so each card you can put a deadline and then you will get Auto
2:49:14
reminder this is what the key feature currently I use I earlier I was using a
2:49:19
notebook to just list on all my open task but why you should go for trillo is
2:49:25
you can able to put a deadline and it will give you automated U reminders okay this task is due please complete
2:49:32
it attachments you can attach the files directly to the cards from their
2:49:37
computer or from integrated device like a Google Drive Dropbox one drive this is
2:49:43
useful for sharing the documents design and resource related task so for example you have given one activity to your
2:49:49
Junior to complete it and then you want to share the requirement document to
2:49:55
complete that activity so what you will do you will share that BRD business requirement document as an attachment to
2:50:01
that card and you will assign that card to your Junior and you will ask him that okay please uh complete the task and uh
2:50:09
you will give him a deadline and you can able to uh create a checklist also that big
2:50:15
task you can divide into small small task and you'll you ask him to it and then you can have a visual representation about how many task he
2:50:22
how many subtask he has completed how much percentage of work is completed already have shared the VD with him so
2:50:29
you need not to have a meeting with him you just have to open the tro and you can check what is the current status team collaboration TR enables
2:50:37
team collaboration allowing users to assign task leave commands and tag team members in discussion this facilitates
2:50:45
the communication and ensures accountability so it's collaboration as I told each card you can able to make
2:50:51
comments so people will contribute for the task it will make this
2:50:57
tool collaborate basically it will bring the collaboration perspective for the project management and
2:51:03
basically it will be it will ensure the accountability powerups so powerups uh
2:51:11
are the trailers way of adding additional functionality to the board basically it is all about integrating TR
2:51:17
with other tools so integration with the slack Google Calendar jira GitHub
2:51:23
Dropbox enhance productivity powerups also include tools like a calendar view
2:51:29
card aging features to customize the workflow so powerups is all about connecting this TR with other tools like
2:51:36
slack Google Calendar J so you can able to sync this particular tro project with
2:51:43
other activity then you have better uh uh synchronization and basically you'll
2:51:48
have overall picture so that's where powerups come into the picture it's all about integration next feature is Butler
2:51:55
you know in easier way it is kind of automation so Butler allows user to automate respective task in tro so every
2:52:03
time you know for example you have three three categories or I would say
2:52:09
three list to do in progress done so what you will do after completing the
2:52:16
task you will manually take down that take out that card from Tod list and you'll put it in in progress once uh you
2:52:23
completed that task you will move that card from in progress to done so this is the manual activity so this can be
2:52:29
automated that automation facility is also there it is called as a butler so automatically move the cards when due
2:52:35
dates are redu reached or add checklist when the cards is moved to a specific list so all checklists are completed
2:52:42
then automatically that card will move from one list to another list so that's the automation part comments and
2:52:49
activity tracking each card has a comment section where the user can communicate provide updates and give
2:52:55
feedback to activity tracking allows user to see the history of changes on the card for example who made the card
2:53:02
update a due date added and attachment calendar view a calendar
2:53:08
power up allows user to see the task which are due which with due dates and
2:53:14
on a calendar view provide overview of upcoming deadlines so calendar view you can see which task is due on what date
2:53:21
you'll get overall perspective about how many tasks are in Pipeline and um what
2:53:26
are their respective deadlines another feature is uh tro has
2:53:31
a mobile app on IOS and Android make it easy to manage the task on go you can able to access it on mobile as well REO
2:53:39
also has predefined templates you know offers templates for various types of projects such as marketing campaigns
2:53:46
event planning product road map software development making it easier to get started so you just have to download the
2:53:52
template and start working upon it if you feel that template is not good enough you can create your own simple template also customizable workflow user
2:54:01
can fully customize their uh workflow because all those things can be renamed by renaming the list and the cards based
2:54:08
on Project requirements to can be adapted for personal use agile teams and
2:54:14
content planning and whatnot much more so these are the top level features of tro fine so it's a group exercise so
Group Exercise: Trello
2:54:23
please uh go to your uh Chrome Microsoft Edge and uh to new
2:54:30
window tro and uh you'll you'll see the first URL itself tro get started it's
2:54:38
free tro is less work more flow click on that link handson experience handson
2:54:44
exercise basically so please please do it parall
2:54:49
go to Trello create a user ID for yourself you should be able to see
2:54:54
similar screen like this uh let me know if you could able to create your login if you could able to see this screen we
2:55:00
can go to the next step you should be able to see the trao and this screen is called as a basically it is for
2:55:08
templates you can able to see all your boards I'll just
2:55:14
uh come out of full screen mode okay okay so
2:55:20
yeah let's here so the exercise is uh we have to create a board with the name of
2:55:27
web development project uh just just uh let's try to understand what's the task
2:55:33
and then we will have uh handson so we have to create a
2:55:39
board name with a web development project so scenario here is that there is a web development project web
2:55:44
development work is going on and you are the project manager and you have to create create a trailer board for this
2:55:50
activity and there will be three three uh there are lot of things you have to do it in the web development and all
2:55:56
those task keys are categor categorized into um five different list one is backlog which is yet to be prioritized
2:56:04
to do which is uh they are prioritized and uh they are yet to be started in
2:56:10
progress that means they are in progress review that means development is completed they are under the review and
2:56:17
done means uh activities uh your activi is completed review is done and things
2:56:23
are completed so like that you have to create uh five list and within that list
2:56:29
you you will have multiple tasks so in backlog you have set up the database
2:56:36
write content for content for about you uh us page
2:56:44
content about us page about us page let let's make make me a double about a page
2:56:51
uh conduct usability testing prepare final project report so these are the things which are yet to be prioritized
2:56:57
too talks about these are the things which are prioritized but these are not yet started so first activity in too is
2:57:03
a research competitor website you have to assign it to somebody else you know
2:57:09
there is hypothetical scenario allies and you have to put a deadline that it is deadline today is let's say 13 it is
2:57:16
deadline on 15th of October you have to make a label for this task as a low priority there is a second to do is
2:57:22
design the homepage you have to assign to another user due in five days you to
2:57:27
make a label for this task as a high priority third to do is create a company logo assign it to third more user in
2:57:35
your team du in four days label is medium priority so these are the to-do list in progress in progress basically
2:57:42
there are there is only one activity which is develop the front end layout you have to assign it to a Bo
2:57:48
do in six test and you have to add the commment that waiting for final design approval uh interview basically in
2:57:56
review there are two task uh research competitor website develop the front end
2:58:02
layout and the done currently you make it as empty nothing is in done side uh cards with checklist so
2:58:10
particularly design the homepage if you go to design the homepage where it is checklist design task design design
2:58:18
the homepage so uh second task under too design the homepage this can be categorized into further small small
2:58:25
steps uh create a wireframe get client approval create a mockups Implement
2:58:30
feedback so these are small small further this big task is divided into further four subtasks and then you have
2:58:37
to basically uncheck all of them which talks about nothing is been completed so
2:58:43
this activity 0 percentage completed and uh attach a file random file from your
2:58:48
PC you can uh attach it which talks about you know hypothetical case about
2:58:53
design brief document it talks about uh the design related details which will be attached to this particular task uh
2:59:02
second activity in checklist is setup database setup database where it is setup
2:59:07
database uh so first activity in backlog setup database so this also can be further categorized into four steps uh
2:59:15
choose database type setup database scheme poate scheme sample data test
2:59:21
connections so like that you can able to create a subtask and you can check or uncheck so this is the task I think uh
2:59:29
you'll get very good understanding about this activity so what I will do so let's
2:59:34
go to our uh tro okay let's create a new
2:59:39
board go to create then there is a menu called create a board click on that board
2:59:47
background you can select uh any of but I think it talks about uh background circuit board
2:59:53
pattern select any pattern I think respective of that one board title you put it as a web development project
3:00:01
visibility private workspace public you put it in workspace so that whatever
3:00:08
people are there under your team they should be able to see the progress and
3:00:13
hit on create so it has created uh board with the name
3:00:19
of web development project with the background what you have selected and uh you should be able to
3:00:26
see your name on the right side let's create a list now so how many list we
3:00:32
need to create uh we need to create backlog to-do in progress review and
3:00:38
done so here there is you can see on the right side a left side add list so click
3:00:44
there first is uh backlog click
3:00:49
on backlog add list then next list
3:00:55
is too to do at list then next one is in
3:01:03
progress add list then in review add list and then last is done or completed
3:01:12
at list okay that's it I think next step let's focus on uh backlog
3:01:18
so in backlog you have to create uh this cards or this top level activity the
3:01:23
first one is setup database so you can see under backlog plus add card card so
3:01:31
click there and uh just copy paste setup database as the first
3:01:37
entry add card next one is the write content for about us page next card
3:01:45
third one is U conduct usability testing third one fourth one is prepare final
3:01:51
project report like that you added four activities now let's uh click the first
3:01:57
one setup database just click on that card you will get a new window like this
3:02:04
you'll get this window so these are basically the properties what we features of that particular task okay
3:02:10
everybody can able to see this popup window let's go over it so it will have the title here setup database it will
3:02:18
show in this which list it is it is in backlog list notifications
3:02:23
are uh watch description you can basically add the description for this task you can
3:02:31
add something like that you know set up the database you can since you are a
3:02:37
project manager you can give some more instructions some more description talk to person
3:02:44
a for guidance like that you can add some description
3:02:50
about the task and accordingly you can delegate it to your your basically
3:02:56
peer uh next feature what I would like to explain is comments you know so you
3:03:01
have the option on the bottom you can able to add a
3:03:06
comment this basically let's say since you are going to delegate to
3:03:12
person a basically your your Mentor your Junior you can say daily
3:03:18
some comments random comments you can able to delegate it to John in this case you
3:03:25
can add that comment so that everybody in your team can able to see what is
3:03:30
been posted where can I set up the database window where can I get the set up
3:03:37
database window uh yeah so let me go back in the backlog did you created uh
3:03:46
this uh cards setup database as the card so watching so there are two things
3:03:53
basically you can looks like if you have created a task and if after a period of time you because of some reason you feel
3:04:00
you think that okay this card is no more valid you want to ignore it you can
3:04:05
simply click on uh stop watching the card so it will not be there will not be
3:04:11
active notifications sent so that's the usage of watching and
3:04:16
stop watching the card so click on watch so it is active it's in uh actively
3:04:22
being worked in your project so delegation option if you click on that
3:04:27
join button I think uh join and leave okay you can able to
3:04:35
so if you want to delegate this task to your member click on that member and you can add the some member so here we said
3:04:42
John I think uh you should uh I think uh
3:04:47
we should create a team in the tro and then you should we can able to use each
3:04:52
other's name I have not explored that feature but essentially in your actual
3:04:57
workplace if you put uh your team members name you should be able to get his email ID and you should be able to
3:05:03
assign this task to that particular person yeah I can able to see
3:05:09
yeah okay fine I I got it so that's how I can able to add the
3:05:16
level just try it out so members you if you want to delegate a task to somebody
3:05:23
else you can use the member option labels if you want to label a particular task with high more medium low or you
3:05:30
can use any of the other uh label and then accordingly you can go to label you
3:05:35
can go to edit accordingly you can able to put the label title and uh you the
3:05:42
label that's how you can use the label uh feature
3:05:49
are you with me you understood when to use member how to use
3:05:54
label V not says yes now let me let's go to checklist so
3:06:00
let's go to our uh exercise so checklist basically last portion of our checklist
3:06:06
talks about setup database we need to create a checklist of uh four items so
3:06:12
go to checklist and checklist title as database setup checklist so click on
3:06:19
checklist give title to title as a database setup steps create ad it will
3:06:27
create a checklist and then you have to give those checklist the first sub
3:06:33
activity is choose database type click choose database type click on ADD it
3:06:38
created here the second one is setup database
3:06:44
scheme go there click there and add third one is populate sample
3:06:52
data copy paste it here add fourth one is the test
3:06:59
connections go there and add so this activity is further divided into four
3:07:04
small activities choose database setup database populate sample data test
3:07:11
connections so that's how you completed and currently none of these four are completed but uh if you click click here
3:07:19
it will strike out this activity it shows that this is completed and it will show overall progress as a 20% activi is
3:07:27
completed you could able to create a checklist just play with the checkbox
3:07:33
accordingly you know things are uh you can see the completion is getting
3:07:40
changed and it is creating the history also so so has done 5 minutes ago these
3:07:46
things they're capturing what activity everybody's doing who has changed
3:07:52
what cap Mark test completion incomplete and all just know all the changes it is
3:07:58
tracking so so is doing something okay I can see so I can assign anyone to complete
3:08:09
this since you made the owner as should be able to edit the checklist currently
3:08:16
I think as a member for for this task but the but the bottom line is whoever is owner for this task he can able to
3:08:23
edit the checklist RTI says yes okay good I'll take I'll go ahead attachment
3:08:29
you can able to uh attach a document here you can able to give a URL for from
3:08:36
drive you can able to uh you can I think directly you can able to click choose a
3:08:42
file you can attach it or you can uh paste a Drive Link which will attach
3:08:48
that reference URL link so that uh that particular assign will use that data so
3:08:53
in the description you should be able to add all the details like uh please refer attach a
3:09:00
document or document for
3:09:06
detailed instructions like that you can add a commment so that once somebody is using
3:09:12
working on that uh uh task he will go to attachment and he will download it and
3:09:17
he will utilize it so that's the feature
3:09:22
attachment so what is the use case here so we are setting up a database we are adding checklist right we have added
3:09:28
members here but what is the outcome we wanted from by doing this activity yes
3:09:35
so a big picture why we are doing what we are doing so yeah just open the
3:09:40
workspace since you are a project manager you can able to see how many tasks are in
3:09:46
backlog how many tasks are in too how many tasks are in progress who is
3:09:51
working on those tasks which are in progress what is the level of
3:09:56
completion how many tasks are in review how many tasks are in completed and accordingly this is a project management
3:10:02
workspace where in in uh you'll get a snapshot about overall information about your project where are
3:10:09
you and all the information will be shared collaboratively to your members
3:10:14
and you need to need not to share the individual information via team or individual information via outlooks
3:10:19
everything will be part of this uh this board so that's the main main idea of
3:10:27
the trailer I see they only added for the backlog card for that particular
3:10:32
card it is added if I open the right content uh you don't see any member you
3:10:38
can add it currently it's empty you can you can add it based on your need you can see the
3:10:44
visual representation also who are all contributing for this so for setup database you can see other
3:10:49
members are there but for right content you don't see any other members what else so let's go to what we
3:10:56
did not explore attachment is clear we can attach a document
3:11:02
cover so you can have card level uh cover you know visual representation
3:11:09
you can change the card level cover and in fact you can use some Emoji you can use
3:11:15
uh the photos which are given in their rep repository you can add additional
3:11:21
photos from your side also to make it more customizable and more user
3:11:28
friendly uh what else then let's go to add powerups so
3:11:37
add pow powerups basically that means uh let let's you can able
3:11:44
to connect this one with other things other other other other
3:11:51
platforms for example you can able to connect it with uh G you can able to
3:11:57
connect this one with uh some other platform so card minor card seeing
3:12:04
process template for trillo categories analogical representing yeah developer tools so
3:12:10
these are the different different platforms so for example development tools go good mode GitHub
3:12:17
scrum agile tools mockup so these are additional tools with which you can able to integrate tro with these tools so
3:12:24
that means if there are some activities are happening in different tool and this particular task you are uh doing the
3:12:32
product management in tro you can also have the sync between this tool and that tool and which are all the other tools
3:12:37
with which you can have the integration so these are the set of different categories so you can integrate with the
3:12:43
sales tools you can integrate with the marketing tool you can integrate with HR tool and these are the tools you just
3:12:48
have to add that tool and accordingly create that linkage the benefit is that everything
3:12:54
will be in sync you will have clear visibility about what is happening on that
3:13:01
task so web [Music] development so powerups clear you can
3:13:08
able to integrate this particular task this particular card on other tools which are
3:13:17
in different different uh domain uh automation so you can able
3:13:24
to automate some of the task move card to
3:13:30
so icon title you can move card to to the top to the bottom of the list
3:13:37
name you can able to move card to too list and uh of the team product
3:13:44
management and you can add action basically uh so for example if the all okay if all
3:13:51
the checklist tasks are completed you can able to move this task from uh
3:13:56
backlog to in progress accordingly you can create Automation and once all the tasks are completed it will
3:14:02
automatically move so ideally basic how how you will do it is that you can
3:14:07
manually move from here to here this is possible so every time you know this conduct usability let's say in this is
3:14:14
backlog this is not under priority I want to bring it Priority mov it from backlog to too just go drw and drop and
3:14:20
too uh basically now I have the bandwidth I'll start I want to start working upon it I I moved this task from
3:14:26
too list to in progress so now it is in progress so it has checklist I completed
3:14:31
all the checklist I feel think that this activity is completed now I want to move it from in progress to review so this
3:14:37
manual activity can be eliminated by going by by doing the Automation and you
3:14:44
can put that uh and accordingly once all the checklists
3:14:49
are completed it can move to the the specified folder specified list which
3:14:55
you have mentioned previously so that is the usage of action button and I think that's it these are
3:15:03
all the options what else we have not explored description activity members
3:15:09
label checklist stes attachment cover custom Fields what is there in the custom
3:15:15
Fields uh add drop down text field dates more to your cards but there are some
3:15:22
additional things but essentially uh if you are a project manager use this Trello create a list of
3:15:28
task you can able to see everything what is happening and you can able to have better collaboration with your team members so that's the
3:15:36
list okay that's it guys I think uh I hope you got uh Fair understanding about
3:15:44
Trello just a quick info guys in PA offers product management course training through this course you will

description and take the first step towards career growth in the field of product management arget uh module
3:16:26
number eight our small topic product life cycle management product life cycle strategy so this we will try to finish
3:16:31
it plus we will start uh phase two which is focused on product strategy and value
3:16:36
proposition so some research I think will be definitely helpful for you in order to Define your path how you would
3:16:42
like to transition fine no problem so let's start with uh module 8 which was
3:16:48
the second part of phase one where we are trying to understand the fundamentals of product management so
3:16:55
module 8 the title of the module is product life cycle and strategy so let me go back to the course what are we
3:17:02
going to learn so we are going to learn what is the meaning of product life cycle and how basically product uh goes
Product Lifecycle and Strategy
3:17:08
through different different life cycle phases Point number one again it is uh very common topic PLC management I think
3:17:15
many of you might be working in product life cycle management the important factor today is basically at the end of
3:17:21
the day what you have learned significantly is the Strategic decisions what product manager makes at different
3:17:26
life cycle stages so this is the important thing which uh you you I think will add lot of value for your
3:17:33
understanding about overall product manager profile the third point is product strategy development I'm not
3:17:39
sure why this this product life cycle strategy because we have separate phase itself product strategy development so I
3:17:46
thought thought about it and instead of uh giving some information here I want to skip Point number three uh we will
3:17:52
discuss about it in product strategy related uh phase which is in next phase
3:17:58
Point number four product portfolio management so we will understand in general what is product portfolio how to
3:18:03
manage product portfolio on point number five PLC management tool so again I
3:18:08
think in last module we had gone through all the tools different types of tools different different tools what product
3:18:14
managers uses not only specific to plc product life cycle management but in general you know product development
3:18:19
product release overall PLC management product launch so jira and aha we
3:18:27
already had a kind of orientation what is these tools uh we had demo session I
3:18:34
think Hands-On session on prelo last time I will be planning similar handson
3:18:39
session for jira but not as a part of this module but when we go to actual product development module I think which
3:18:45
is in next phases where in actually product manager will work with engineering team at that time what are
3:18:51
those features of jira which product manager should know so I'll touch Bas about uh J in detail there but
3:18:57
essentially model step number five introduction to the different tools under PC management we already covered
3:19:05
uh number six uh we will have very interesting case study uh Netflix how what are the different products they
3:19:12
have launched over a period of time and how basically uh they have have managed
3:19:17
their product life cycle very well so it was one of the success story so I have created a case study
3:19:24
uploaded upload it on a Google Drive I think share Drive uh which I will ask you to go through it and after that we
3:19:30
can discuss and last point is evaluating product performance and metrices again I
3:19:36
am not uh sure why this seven and three
3:19:42
is there as a part of this curriculum because again we have separate modul on product analytics called as product
3:19:50
analytics which involves detailed understanding of product performance and different metries so this point number
3:19:56
seven and point number three we will park for next pages with that said let's
3:20:01
uh go to understanding product life cycle so what is product life cycle so
Understanding Product Lifecycle Stages
3:20:10
product life cycle management refers to a it's a strategic process of managing products Journey from
3:20:17
Inception or from concept to its decline basically until we retire the product it
3:20:23
involves overseeing the entire life cycle of a product from early stage of development through Market introduction
3:20:30
growth maturity and eventually decline effective product life cycle management helps companies to maximize product
3:20:36
profitability and make informed decisions at each phase so this is very very important to know if if you are a
3:20:42
product manager you should be able to tell currently you are in which phase of the PLC management and accordingly
3:20:49
product manager will will have different different strategies on those on that product considering what phase it is so
3:20:57
this is the graph okay so overall this U product life cycle is divided into five
3:21:02
stages five phases the first one is development phase you know you can see
3:21:07
development phase wherein uh mostly you are working with R&D team and you know
3:21:13
incubation is started product development concept feasibility is been tested but essentially lot of time you
3:21:19
are going to work up product development but you don't have any Revenue you don't see any sales uh the next one is
3:21:25
Introduction phase you know wherein you have just launched the product uh sales started picking you started generating
3:21:31
Revenue steadily slowly you can see the product revenue is increasing growing
3:21:37
customer base you know you are trying to build the brand for your product you know you you have done the pricing you
3:21:43
have worked on distribution channels so this is the production phase wherein uh slowly slowly you are getting Revenue
3:21:51
then growth phase actually where you know customers have accepted your product they have liked your product and
3:21:59
it kind of you know the exponential growth phase where in you will see a good amount of uh Revenue increase where
3:22:07
you know you are trying to gain the profit there is a demand for your product is increasing and uh you start looking for
3:22:15
there is a competition in in the market some people are started looking at your product they started you know buying
3:22:21
your product some of the players they will do the reverse engineering and they will try to mimic your product so you
3:22:27
might see some competition this is the growth phase where you can see you can see the revenue is increasing
3:22:34
exponentially the number of units sold are increasing exponentially this will
3:22:39
go uh for couple of uh months or years depends upon what type of product it is
3:22:44
but after few after sometime you will feel that you know it kind of saturated whatever you do you can add some
3:22:51
features you can launch new generation of product but looks like uh you are not able to capture additional market so it
3:22:59
is called as a saturation phase or maturity phase wherein uh sales have peaked growth is stabilized Market is
3:23:06
Satur s saturated and uh basically this this this current technology is also
3:23:12
saturated everybody's using it and meanwhile you can see that the new technology is emerging and slowly slowly
3:23:20
people are moving towards new technology so you can see slight decline in the
3:23:25
product Revenue it is called as a maturity phase and the last phase where in Decline wherein you know the product
3:23:32
uh new generation of product is already launch launched and uh we are no more
3:23:38
kind of putting additional efforts additional resources on this generation of product and the sales for this
3:23:44
generation product has decre basically they are in decreasing Trend so this is
3:23:49
a typical product life cycle phases and this is typical product life cycle graphical representation at each stage
3:23:56
product manager will make specific decisions to adapt to market dynamics customer needs and competive Landscape
3:24:03
so product manager responsibility is in each phase how can I effectively make a decisions which can capture maximum
3:24:09
revenue for the product and it can able to generate maximum revenue for the organization so these are the phases
3:24:15
development introduction growth maturity decline development actual R&D work engineering development introduction you
3:24:21
just launched it you know you have initial set of customers they started UTI using your product some of them have
3:24:27
liked it growth Market has accepted your product you can see suddenly jumping the
3:24:32
demand high growth maturity you know you can see the demand is kind of saturated
3:24:38
whatever you do you can you're not able to increase the sales significantly uh and uh parall you can
3:24:46
see you know a new generation of product people are launching and the decline wherein you know uh your sales has
3:24:53
decreased and you are basically new your customers are moving towards uh New
3:24:58
Generation product from your organization or they are moving New Generation product from your competitor
3:25:03
example product name yeah I think uh we can take example of your uh mobile
3:25:09
handset you know in fact uh 4G based mobiles you can take when 4G was
3:25:15
launched it was was under development phase and uh Jo was the first one I
3:25:20
think who have came up with a proper well workking smartphone during development phase then
3:25:27
initially they gave kind of uh they came up with a marketing strategy wherein they gave data free for couple of months
3:25:34
wherein you know people have bought their seam they started utilizing the data since it was free of cost they
3:25:40
could able to capture the initial customer the intention from Jo was to check the compatibility of their system
3:25:47
to check if can if if it can able to handle so many customers at a time or not so accordingly you know they have
3:25:55
introduced the product and you know in growth phase they can they have seen the rapid increase in the market parall I
3:26:01
think uh Airtel BSNL other guys also started coming up in 4G segment they
3:26:08
started giving the competition now it is kind of 4G Market is uh I I'm telling currently it is in Decline phase but
3:26:14
couple of years back it was in maturity phase so whatever new plans goo used to
3:26:20
come up uh they could not able to capture additional market share there was a competition they used to pull each
3:26:26
other's customers Go versus AEL but however you know the kind of 4G Market was saturated parall you know uh 5G was
3:26:34
successful and Geo started moving from 4G to 5G currently if you see uh Geo
3:26:41
smartphones which are on 4G Bas 4G based Technologies I think they are not doing
3:26:46
additional investment on those smartphones uh since the new technology is already available so those
3:26:52
smartphones are kind of in declining phase and now everybody has moved to the 5G technology yeah so if this uh PLC
3:27:00
phases are clear then let's try to understand what it is uh what it what it
3:27:05
is mean for product manager so let's see the Strategic decisions at different
3:27:12
life cycle what the product manager makes the first one uh development stage
Strategic Decisions at Different Lifecycle Stages
3:27:17
so description as we discussed uh this is a pre-launch phase where in product is in development it involves uh
3:27:23
ideation lot of research you know prototypes MVP there are no Revenue at
3:27:29
this point and costs are very high you invested heavily or R&D related expenses
3:27:35
but you not made a single rupee from your product so this is called as a development phase what are those key
3:27:41
decisions for a product manager so wherein you know product manager will closely work with the market marketing team they will ask to conduct in-depth
3:27:48
market research to understand understand customer pinpoint areas what are the additional features uh they need to
3:27:55
include what are the features they need to include in their product and accordingly the prototypes are developed
3:28:01
uh product manager will closely work with marketing team to understand what is our target audience Market
3:28:07
segmentation to be precise what are the competitive landscape for all our core
3:28:13
competitors what kind of products they are having in the market at so all those detailed research product manager will
3:28:18
do along with the marketing team parall product manager will work with the engineering and development team to to
3:28:25
check the feasibility and concept testing so validate the product idea with the prototypes surveys focus
3:28:32
group to access the technical feasibility and Market viability so here focus group means basically a selected
3:28:39
set of customers it is for MVP kind of application wherein uh you have
3:28:45
prototype you have kind of two concepts uh ready you don't know which one to be
3:28:50
finalized so what you have what you have decided you asked engineering to come up with the MVP and then you are kind of uh
3:28:57
giving this MVP to certain customers and ask them okay please use it and let me know which one is uh better
3:29:05
considering Market viability so accordingly he will work with the engineering and you know kind of uh
3:29:12
selected set of customers to validate feasibility and concept tting he'll work with engineering to
3:29:19
finalize the development plan collaborate with R&D team engineers and designers to finalize the product design
3:29:25
and set Milestones so you can have he will have kind of bi-weekly or monthly
3:29:31
review with the engineering team he will check whether uh all things are on track or not and uh he will have you know all
3:29:39
those questions ready all the gate basically product will go from alpha beta and all those matured phases so all
3:29:46
those gate reviews he will be involved and product manager is the one who will give approval for those gate reviews by
3:29:53
looking at uh product development plan by looking at um test results Alpha test
3:29:59
results beta test results go to market strategy product manager again will work with the marketing team in order to
3:30:05
finalize okay what should be the pricing for our product what kind of distribution channels we should use it for launching the product what kind of
3:30:12
marketing strategy is the way in which I think um so Mill sub Mill mentioned about Joo similarly I think what kind of
3:30:19
marketing strategies we should use it for our product accordingly product manager will work closely with marketing team to define those marketing
3:30:25
strategies and they will have kind of a rough timeline about uh launch when to launch the product overall go to market
3:30:33
plan will be finalized during development phase uh budget allocation again it
3:30:39
happens uh way at the start of development phase itself where in budget and all everything will be written in
3:30:45
the vision document and accordingly budget resources are allocated to different different stakeholders
3:30:51
allocate resources efficiently between development testing pre-launch marketing efforts so all those things product
3:30:57
manager will have estimation about what kind of resources are required and accordingly budget allocation and budget
3:31:03
release will happen in this phase so these are the key things what product manager will do market research
3:31:09
visibility concept development planning defining goto Market strategy budget
3:31:15
related things this is what the development phase means for product
3:31:21
manager very very crucial because uh this will PVE the foundation for overall
3:31:27
product success this is about development phase and now let's focus on introduction phase so introduction phase
3:31:34
basically the product is introduced to the market so you have done the launching sales are initially slow as as
3:31:40
I'm basically slowly slowly awareness is getting built up in the market and Company is like a report feature of
3:31:49
ENT okay I think that was for this one sorry awareness is getting builded up
3:31:54
and the companies focused on the market penetration cost remains High profits may be low or
3:32:00
negative yeah so this is the phase as we discussed you know you just launched the product slowly slowly awareness is
3:32:06
getting builted up you are but basically here you started making money so profits
3:32:12
are negative low definitely they will be negative because see you spend so much amount of money during development phase
3:32:19
and it might not happen you know during introduction phase itself you will recover all those money so from return
3:32:25
on investment perspective you will see the return is negative during introduction phase that's how it is for
3:32:30
all the you know products during introduction phase uh costs are high but
3:32:36
at least you started looking for um you started realizing revenue and uh you are
3:32:41
looking for uh basically opportunities to penetrate R your product so
3:32:48
accordingly basically you launched one product you in one particular geography and uh sales are speaking up and now you
3:32:55
are looking for okay what else where else I can launch this product so that I can able to increase my return on
3:33:01
investment so what are the key decisions for a product manager in introduction phase pricing strategy you know as we
3:33:07
discussed in go to market strategy itself basically we started working with marketing team in order to finalize
3:33:13
pricing distribution so pricing decide decide between penetrating penetration
3:33:19
pricing low price to attract early adopters or scheming pricing high price to recover development cost so there are
3:33:26
different different pricing strategy product manager and marketing team will decide again we will have in detail
3:33:34
module about how to set up the pricing but uh for this concept per se uh there are two kind of concept penetrating
3:33:40
pricing wherein you know we will have a low pricing initially kind of um launch
3:33:45
offers pre-launch offers launch offers wherein we are asking customers to okay please use our product we are ready to
3:33:51
give you 40% discount 50% of discount since you are our first customer or scheming pricing wherein um uh you you
3:34:00
feel that you are uh you have good amount of demand forecasted demand so you are telling that okay I would like
3:34:06
to put it as a premium pricing because my intention is not to increase the customer base but my intention is I
3:34:13
would like to recover my development phase because that's how my financial targets are because I need to pay back
3:34:18
money to my investors it could be any decisions so basically in introduction phase you will look at look at the
3:34:25
product from how much revenue it has made and basically you will decide the different different pricing strategies
3:34:32
for penetration purpose again you will work with marketing team for uh invest
3:34:37
marketing campaigns to create awareness and educate customers this can include the digital marketing partnership or
3:34:44
influencers collaboration so since product is launched you will look for okay another revenues another Avenues
3:34:51
basically to increase the revenue uh potential so can we go for digital
3:34:56
marketing can I partner with somebody else can I you know advertise it on YouTube influencers so what is the right
3:35:03
way wherein I can make my promotional activities so that I can able to create Maximum Impact to the market uh
3:35:11
distribution channel so even though you started working with marketing team on deciding the distribution channels
3:35:17
however you know the optimization related work so you would have decided okay I'll be using some distribution
3:35:23
channels but uh you by looking at the revenue you can able to check you are you are basically getting the actual
3:35:28
feedback okay then you can able to decide whether you made a whatever decision you made during development
3:35:33
phase about a particular distribution channel is right or not so accordingly you can optimize distribution channels
3:35:40
choose the right channels to distribute the product whether online or whether to retail or whether to make a partner or
3:35:46
via direct sales accordingly you can optimize the distribution channels
3:35:52
feedback mechanisms you will closely work with the you know sales team to get
3:35:58
the feedback from end customers establish system together early customer feedback refine the products on this
3:36:05
input so you'll closely monitor okay what kind of feedback you are getting from the end customers and uh if there
3:36:10
are lot of negative feedbacks you know you have to quickly act upon it and accordingly you have to adjust is the
3:36:15
product feature this is very very crucial time because uh you know a
3:36:22
positive reviews and negative reviews very spread very fastly so you have to ensure that uh if there are negative
3:36:28
reviews you have to ensure that you are quickly acting on acted upon it and whatever modifications required on the
3:36:34
product you are you need to closely work with engineering team in order to make those modifications sales strategy align sales
3:36:42
align with sales team with marketing efforts and provide tools for customer education and onboarding accordingly
3:36:47
basically you will create a manuals you'll create a demos you might in B2B
3:36:53
segments particularly you you will visit multiple customers you will show them the demos you will release the marketing
3:37:01
collaterals and all those things you will do it in order to capture more and more customers so that's what you do it
3:37:06
in introduction phase pricing marketing promotion distribution Channel
3:37:13
optimization uh sales different creating different different sales strategies and
3:37:18
closely looking at customer feedback and if there are issues you will closely work with engineering team in order to
3:37:24
close those gaps so this is the introduction phase but essentially did you guys clear
3:37:31
what are the things product manager will do don't worry about the details uh since we have separate separate modules I don't want to go in detail otherwise
3:37:38
we will be derailing the PLC related discussion uh but just try to understand
3:37:43
uh the overview about what activities product manager will do okay fine let's move to growth phase growth phase uh
3:37:50
description uh basically the product starts ging acceptance people have liked
3:37:55
your product and you are spending good amount of you know money on promos
3:38:01
marketing activities so because of that uh sales are increasing rapidly this is
3:38:07
the most profitable phase as both revenue and market share goes up while
3:38:13
competition also intens I uh so as we discussed basically this
3:38:19
is the phase wherein you can see exponential growth for your revenue for your uh number of units being sold and
3:38:27
uh this is the phase in which you will capture maximum revenue from the market
3:38:32
so this phase is focused on uh what are the product manager SS and responsibilities so your key
3:38:39
stakeholders for this one is your operations team so you have to expand production Logistics customer support to
3:38:46
meet the increasing demand so I think we had one uh somebody shared I think VOD
3:38:52
it was VOD who shared that U ashirvad at case from ITC so I think uh if they know
3:39:01
that they are actually in growth phase they would have focused more on backend operations so accordingly you know
3:39:08
scaling up operations is very very important you have to make sure that you know you have sufficient foundational
3:39:14
infrastructural facilities available in order to capture the increased demand Market expansion so okay you have you
3:39:22
have good foundation you have good uh framework available but again in growth phase you will like you would like to
3:39:28
expand the market further so you look for identify new customer segments you will look for identifying launching the
3:39:35
product in new geographical segments or use usage occasions to grow market share
3:39:43
so in know promotional activity Diwali Festival so you will you'll you'll put
3:39:48
more efforts on increasing your market share increasing basically on Market expansion but in growth phase you know
3:39:56
you again as I told you know we will keep on looking for the customer feedback so you might find there are
3:40:02
couple of uh product related improvements are also possible because you have been getting the feedback from
3:40:07
End customer so in this pH you can think of rolling out the enhancements new
3:40:13
features or bug fixes uh complimentary products to say to stay uh competitive
3:40:18
into the market so you can think of creating additional features you can think of working on the bug fixes a
3:40:26
facelift so you can you are basically essentially you are improving your uh
3:40:31
product value proposition brand building you know you'll invest heavily in branding and marketing to build the
3:40:37
customer loyalty and differentiate from competitors pricing adjustment depending upon uh demand and competition either
3:40:44
maintain initial pricing or consider reducing the pricing to attract more customer pricing
3:40:50
related things basically you again you can think of you know since you are looking for a new geography you might
3:40:55
want to go for promotional activities so accordingly you can have pricing related adjustment again you can have pricing
3:41:02
related adjustment based on different different geography so in one geography where in product is actually in uh
3:41:08
already launched it is picking up the phase you will keep the pricing as it is or you can think of increasing the price
3:41:15
so that you will capture maximum revenue and since you are looking for add new geography there you can think of going
3:41:21
for discounted pricing to capture initial customers partnership establish
3:41:26
partnership or collaboration with to boost the to boost reach such as uh
3:41:32
retailers Distributors strategic Alliance so this is the phase wherein you will work with sales team and you'll
3:41:38
check okay what is do we have sufficient resources available for making the direct sales if you don't have
3:41:44
sufficient resources is available you will look for partnership opportunities so accordingly we will collaborate with
3:41:50
those people in order retailers distributors in order to have partnership and you are basically
3:41:55
increasing your product reach so that it should be product should be easily available uh across multiple customers
3:42:03
so that's how these are the things you will do it in growth phase majorly focused on scaling up the operations
3:42:10
looking for additional opportunities for increasing the Market expansion and you
3:42:15
can think of making your product even more attractive by adding some more
3:42:21
features or you know you can have if there are bug fixes you will go for buck
3:42:26
fix bug fixes and you will basically revive revive your product in this phase
3:42:31
to remain competitive this is growth phase for product manager maturity phase uh sales growth slows down as Market
3:42:39
becomes saturated the product has achieved its big potential uh profits are stable but uh
3:42:47
growth prospects may be limited so that's what I was telling even though you spend good amount of um resources on
3:42:54
promotional activities marketing activities hardly you see any Improvement in the revenue so
3:43:01
that shows that uh this technology this product is matured perhaps you need to
3:43:06
look go for New Generation technology or new new new product so what you will do
3:43:12
okay since you know that product is matured but you you will not ignore the product as a product manager what you will do product differentiation focus on
3:43:20
product variations so you can think of launching new models you can think of launching new versions you can think of
3:43:26
um giving more updates for your product to keep the product fresh and to attract
3:43:32
different customer segments so here your major aim is to defend your current market share because sales are going
3:43:39
down and your sales are basically not increases and then you would like to defend your product it might happen that
3:43:45
you know whatever your customers are there they might go to your competitors product so in order to rain them you are
3:43:53
continuously looking for Mark product differentiation opportunities so what are those product differentiation opportunities you would like to launch a
3:44:00
new variant you would like to launch a new version or you would like to launch updates so if you look at you know uh
3:44:08
redm you know what they do so once they have redmi 13 redmi 13 Pro red 13 Pro
3:44:16
Max these are like a new new variants which they launch so initially when they launch the product it is only redmi 13
3:44:22
but after some period of time when they feel that 13 Market you know Market is saturated people don't want to buy any
3:44:28
more redm 13 what they will do they will go for redmi 13 Pro so they will say okay camera is Advanced Battery capacity
3:44:36
is Advanced there were issues what we were seeing in uh original Market or first first um product we have uh kind
3:44:44
of came up with a bug fix solution for those issues and now it has improved the performance so like that you are trying
3:44:50
to differentiate your product and you would like to defend your market share so that's the first activity what you as
3:44:58
a product manager will do it second activity very very important cost optimization so you see you know most of
3:45:05
the cost reduction things cost reduction projects will come into the picture wherein you are looking for
3:45:10
opportunities to reduce the production and operation cost to maintain the profitability because you understood
3:45:16
that whatever you do revenue is not going to increase but your aim is to increase the profitability profitability increased by
3:45:23
either you increase revenue or you reduce the cost so since it is in maturity phase you don't have any
3:45:29
opportunities to increase the revenue so additional thing is reduce the cost so how will you do the cost cutting you
3:45:36
will think okay what are those operational things where in it can be optimized to reduce the cost uh you can
3:45:42
think of you know um reducing those resources also so earlier you decided that for product support I need five
3:45:48
resources but in order to make your product um more attractive you will think okay I don't need fire resources
3:45:55
it is matured now people have learned how to deal with the issues I don't want F I'll just go for three so those two
3:46:02
resources you have reduced it so because of which your operational cost has been came down so this is the phase wherein
3:46:08
uh this is the activity wherein you can think you can say that there are lot of layoffs are happening typically when
3:46:14
company companies don't achieve their financial targets they do the layoff and why they do the layoff because of cost
3:46:21
optimization I think uh if you look at uh not very far away uh but uh one year
3:46:28
back only there was a mass layoff from Google Mass layoff from Microsoft Mass layoff from meta my organization also
3:46:35
did lot of layoffs so what why they do all those things because they would like to reduce the cost one of the way to
3:46:41
reduce the cost is uh reduce the resources so this this is the cost optimization but uh you as a product
3:46:47
manager will not do you know human resources related to cost optimization but you will look at the opportunities
3:46:53
for product level cost optimization you will look at your operational cost you will look at your resource related cost and accordingly you will say I don't
3:47:00
need five resources I need only three resources so those two resources will be allocated to some other product not for
3:47:05
your product but cost optimization is the key activity you will do it during the maturity phase customer retention
3:47:12
Implement loyalty programs customer engagement strategies improved after sales services to retain existing
3:47:19
customers so these are the as we discussed you know product differentiation it could be launching the new product or it could be you know
3:47:25
retaining the customers by using some loyalty programs promotion tweaks uh shift marketing Focus from customer
3:47:32
acquisition to retention upscaling cross selling on other products in portfolio
3:47:38
so if you get this product you will get some discount on this product like that you know you'll have some marketing
3:47:44
related Strat IES in order to retain the current market share pricing strategy so
3:47:49
you can think of reducing the pricing also in order to retain the customer customer segments typically you you'll
3:47:55
look for those big billion sales the value offers flip cart related you know
3:48:00
again big billion days and all those kind of uh um opportunities in order to
3:48:07
attract more and more customers you would like to or you can say a winter sale you would have heard about winter
3:48:13
sale typically it is very famous during in apparel industry so wherein they will
3:48:19
reduce the cost and they will they would like to clear the existing inventory existing inventory means they would like to clear the existing inventory for old
3:48:28
generation product so consider price reduction building the products to sustain demand compete against newer
3:48:35
entrant into the market Channel optimization explore newer more efficient distribution channels such as
3:48:40
e-commerce direct to Consumer models so you can think of uh in earlier you might
3:48:45
have used direct sales but in order to reduce that um sales resources you will
3:48:50
think that okay I don't want to do a selling for this product I will directly push my product through e-commerce and I
3:48:56
can able to reduce those resources accordingly I can able to reduce the cost which I am encountering because of
3:49:03
uh having the direct sales so those things also you will do it during maturity phase your idea is increase the
3:49:10
profitability if not from revenue side then reduce the cost and accordingly ensure that you are getting
3:49:18
optimal uh profits from the product this is the maturity phase for the product managers let's go to last last phase
3:49:26
which is declining phase decline phase uh sales begin to decline as the product
3:49:31
becomes outdated obsolete customer uh they would like to move to the new
3:49:37
product competition might have introduced better Alternatives maintaining profitability becomes very
3:49:42
very difficult so key decisions for a product manager product revitalization
3:49:48
decide whether to invest in product refresh upgrade responding to extend its
3:49:54
life or whether to retire the product plan to smooth or basically retirement
3:50:00
basically smoothly phase out the product discontinue the product while maintaining the customer satisfaction so
3:50:06
it's very very important you know in declining phase uh it is very key decision to understand whether you are
3:50:12
in maturity phase or whether you are in declining phase because if you feel you are in maturity phase what you will do
3:50:18
you will spend some more resources in order to revitalize Revitalize the product or increase you know making the
3:50:24
product refresh upgrades and but if you feel that okay you are in declining phase you will have
3:50:30
a strategy to retire the product so it is very very important for a product manager to understand have a clear
3:50:36
bifurcation about the maturity versus decline harest strategy focus on maximizing the profitability by reducing
3:50:43
the cost maximizing marketing and extending the product life cycle life in
3:50:48
Nishi market so in declining phase also product manager can think okay uh there
3:50:53
is a particular niche market this is a particular geography wherein I don't see the competition for uh New Generation
3:51:00
product so I can still sell my old generation products in this particular
3:51:05
geography and accordingly they can have harvesting strategy so maximize exploiting one particular geography to
3:51:13
uh capture more and more Revenue that's what the harvesting strategy means Inventory management monitor inventory
3:51:20
closely to avoid over production and manage stocks effectively to reduce the excess again you will have closely close
3:51:26
look at operations related things so you don't want to capture more and more inventory you would like to reduce the
3:51:31
inventory handling related expenses end of life support established customer communication plan and services support
3:51:38
offering existing users as the product winds down so end of life support
3:51:43
customer notification and inform them that okay this this particular product will be phased out and in place of this
3:51:49
product you can think of having New Generation product typically it happens for B2B segments but the key thing for product
3:51:57
manager is to understand whether you are in maturity or whether you are in declining phase and accordingly you will
3:52:03
either keep on pumping the money to refresh your products or you will come up with a strategy to phase out to your
3:52:10
product and harvesting strategy is very very important so um you will look at
3:52:16
you know kind of a new existing geography wherein you will you feel that uh there is a less competition and there
3:52:23
is a less probability that competitor will launch a new generation product in coming future so you will still keep
3:52:30
your product alive for that particular geography so that you can able to uh
3:52:36
take out some more revenue from your product so these are the these are kind
3:52:41
of a key decisions product manager will do it in declining phase is it clear declining phase
3:52:48
declining State a smartphone example so I think we had a lot of discussion but
3:52:54
still let's understand you know this PLC life cycle from s smartphone perspective
3:53:00
development Research into new new features like uh foldable screen okay introduction first generation foldable
3:53:06
smartphone in is introduced uh with a high price and intense marketing a
3:53:12
growth phase you know sales increases increased as more customers are adopting this pable screen
3:53:20
kind of uh feature best products and uh you are the first one into the market uh
3:53:28
competitor has seen your product they see the potential they started doing the
3:53:33
reverse engineering and they also they are also coming up with their own product which has this foldable screen feature so computers are also entering
3:53:40
into the market maturity phase wherein smartphones are widely adopted uh the companies focus on minor Innovations
3:53:47
targeted features like a better cameras and all but specifically foldable screen
3:53:53
this kind of feature is matured uh you don't see any more Revenue increased because of this feature this is a
3:54:00
maturity phase and declining phase basically a sales drop drops as new technology emerges it is could be
3:54:07
augmented reality glasses or leading to a potential product phase out so you have
3:54:14
new generation technology arvr kind of feature wherein this foldable feature
3:54:20
might not be applicable in that case you the customers are moving towards New
3:54:26
Generation products which has foldable plus arvr kind of features and
3:54:31
accordingly you decided that okay let's go for New Generation technology and let's phas out this product it is a
3:54:37
declining just just a case of smartphone for smartphone as an example with a foldable screen as a feature
3:54:45
development ruction growth maturity and decline importance of a PLM for product managers product life cycle management
3:54:51
enables product managers to proactively manage the life cycle by making data driven decisions maximize the
3:54:58
profitability prolong product relevance and optimize resource available at each stage so as I told whatever decisions
3:55:06
you are going to make as a product manager this should be based on data driven if you say that you are in maturity phase it should be based on
3:55:12
data driven if you are going to to product line head and you you are telling that okay I think that our
3:55:18
product is in declining phase you should have a proper data to show that you are in declining phase you can go for last
3:55:25
quarterly sales data you can go for what competitors are doing you can go for marketing reports like a new generation
3:55:32
technology and with all the justification you should be able to convince him that okay let's plan for
3:55:39
phasing out of phasing out this product since uh marketing is moving towards
3:55:44
technology so you should go with the proper data to make your point uh clear
3:55:51
and basically product manager primary aim is to maximum profitability from this product for your organization and
3:55:58
you have to prolong the product relevance you have to be relevant into the market and optimize the resources in
3:56:06
order to capture higher profit margins for the
3:56:11
organization so this is all about product life cycle and what are the Strategic decisions product managers
3:56:18
will make in order to manage the PLM you need not to wait for revenue stagnated
3:56:23
or Revenue decline because potentially by waiting you are uh losing out the growth related opportunities if you feel
3:56:30
that additional adding the additional features it will add lot of value to the End customer why not go for it it is it
3:56:36
will add profitability for your product next one is uh product portfolio
3:56:43
management again small topic product portfolio management so what is product portfolio management PPM so the PPM is a
Product Portfolio Management
3:56:51
process of managing entire portfolio of a products offered by a organization or
3:56:56
a company it involves making strategic decisions about which products to develop invest maintain discontinue
3:57:04
based on market performance customer needs and Company objectives the goal of
3:57:09
PPM is to optimize the product mix to achieve the company's financial and strategic goals so here uh you know you
3:57:17
consider yourself to be a group product manager wherein you are handling portfolio of a product portfolio means
3:57:25
you have uh multiple products under under your perview and that is called as
3:57:30
a product portfolio and uh what you supposed to do is that you will make a
3:57:36
decisions on that product portfolio about uh which products you would like to invest which products which products
3:57:42
you would like to develop which products you would like to keep on investing which products you would like to
3:57:47
maintain it which products you would like to discontinue based on again as we discussed you know market performance
3:57:53
how much revenue we are getting what kind of customer needs we are fulfilling what are our company objectives and
3:57:59
couple of more variables like a market Trend competitive analysis and accordingly when you make a decisions on
3:58:06
a group of product it is product portfolio and it is product portfolio Management in in Layman language key
3:58:13
aspects of a product portfolio management is strategic alignment ensure that all products in the portfolio align
3:58:20
with company's overall mission vision and goals so always you will refer what does organization would like to do and
3:58:27
accordingly you will make a decision on your product portfolio prioritization helps
3:58:34
prioritize which products to focus based on potential return market demand and resource allocation so for example you
3:58:40
have five products under your perview and but all product all five are having
3:58:45
different different features they serve different different customer demands and they have their own performance So based
3:58:51
on that you know you can able to prioritize which one of those five are kind of a key products for you and
3:58:58
accordingly you can make investment decisions so prioritization is an important aspect for product portfolio
3:59:04
management again resource allocation manage the resources uh manage the
3:59:09
distribution of uh Financial human and operational resources es a capital you
3:59:15
know across the different products to Max maximize the profitability and efficiency again uh you it is
3:59:23
hypothetical case that you have infinite number of resources but in practicality you will have limited Financial
3:59:30
Resources remal Human Resources limited operational resources you have to prioritize which products you would like
3:59:36
to focus more on so accordingly once you have to if you have to manage product
3:59:41
portfolio this resource allocation is an key aspect so that's where product portfolio management will ke important Ro role
3:59:49
product life cycle management you know monitors the stages of each product within your portfolio from life cycle
3:59:57
perspective introduction growth maturity decline just before sometime we discussed and adjust the strategies
4:00:03
accordingly such as investing in growth product or phasing out of the declining ones so once you are portfolio manager
4:00:11
you will have a overall understanding about okay I have five products each of
4:00:16
these products falls under which product life cycle and accordingly we'll make those decisions what we discussed in
4:00:22
previous section session risk management identifies uh risk across the portfolio
4:00:28
such as Market shifts technological changes balances investment across high risk
4:00:35
High reward products and stable performance so risk mitigation I think
4:00:40
that's what we were discussed on one question was there I think it was from
4:00:46
uh Anita I guess uh so risk management is an key roles and responsibility for a
4:00:52
portfolio product manager wherein he will look at uh the technological risk Market related risk and accordingly he
4:00:59
will focus on high risk High reward products and those who are stable performance so risk management is
4:01:05
important aspect any questions what is product portfolio management and why do we need what are the key aspects of
4:01:12
product portfolio management strategic alignment prioritization resource allocation PLC management risk
4:01:18
management so this this is all on portfolio essentially portfolio means a group of products and and for each
4:01:25
product there will be a product manager but over and above product manager will report to group product manager a group
4:01:32
product manager is kind of a portfolio manager he has multiple products to take care of it is basically a portfolio for
4:01:39
um services so you can have one service transportation service another Services local hotel booking third one could
4:01:46
Beary fourth one could be something else and accordingly you'll have portfolio managers yeah so helps to prioritize
4:01:52
which products to focus based on potential returns market demand and resource allocation so let's take example of um handset mobiles so you
4:02:01
have product portfolio for example uh in let's take example of xiaomi redmi and
4:02:08
they have a product portfolio which has uh 5G based products as a one of the
4:02:13
product portfolio and then within 5G they have multiple product line multiple products basically one is uh 11 redm 11
4:02:21
redmi 12 redmi 13 redmi 14 so but on top of it basically each product will have
4:02:27
their own product manager but all of them are reporting to a group product manager group product manager is working
4:02:32
as a portfolio manager for 5G products so what he will do he will prioritize
4:02:39
which product to focus based on potential return market demand and resource allocation so he will see that
4:02:44
market is uh um we are going to launch redm xiaomi 14 into the market so
4:02:52
considering Mark potential returns he will focus more uh resources on um redm
4:02:59
14 however for 13 and 12 he will give basic minimum resource or support required in order to sustain the market
4:03:06
so that's how he will prioritize it so within his portfolio he will have n number of products and within that
4:03:13
products which product should give more priority based on uh return on investment based
4:03:18
on market demand and accordingly he will finalize the budget and resources so that's the prioritization aspect uh mu
4:03:28
importance of product portfolio management um better decision making helps business uh to make uh data D
4:03:35
decisions about product development and resource allocation improved profitability since uh by focusing on
4:03:42
the right products reducing the invest ment on underperforming ones PPM portfolio manager can improve the
4:03:47
overall profitability Innovative management encourage a balance between Innovation new product development and
4:03:54
sustaining existing products Market responsiveness ensures the product
4:04:00
portfolio evolves with the market trends and customer preferences by maintaining
4:04:05
at the end you are ensuring that you are maintaining competitive Advantage example a smartphone company
4:04:11
might use a portfolio management to decide how much investment is its existing Flagship
4:04:17
Model A lowc cost model and future technology Innovations like a foldable fundes by assessing market trends
4:04:24
customer demands profitability they can allocate resources to ensure balanced and
4:04:29
successful product portfolio so yeah so you have some
4:04:35
products which are like uh old generation products so you have current generation products and you have new
4:04:41
generation products so portfolio manager will ensure that there is a Synergy between all these three products and he
4:04:47
will prioritize the resources budgeting requirement in order to capture maximum uh revenue for the organization on a
4:04:54
portfolio basis so that's the roles and responsibility of a portfolio manager
4:05:00
typical designations for p portfolio managers are group product manager senior group product managers and
4:05:05
director is also kind of uh portfolio manager but within director
4:05:11
I think director handles multiple product portfolio director typically is product line head
4:05:16
so if you look at the chronologically on top you have product line within that product line you have multiple product
4:05:23
portfolios within that portfolios you have multiple products and there is a product manager is for individual
4:05:29
products he reports to group product manager which is uh product portfolio manager followed by who reports to
4:05:36
director who is product line manager that's how it is essentially it is same as that of a product manager however it
4:05:42
is just for group of products just a quick info guys intellipath offers product management course training

4:06:29
in Phase number two so phase number two title is product strategy and value proposition we are targeting moduel
4:06:34
number nine so the model number nine you know the title is product features and product lines so essentially we are
4:06:41
trying to understand what is the meaning of product feature what is the meaning of product mix what is the meaning of
4:06:47
product lines and uh you know how to design a product features how to develop
4:06:53
a product specifications what is the meaning of product line extension what does product
4:06:59
line modification means product portfolio management tools this again
4:07:04
it's about uh a set of tools which we need to use it for product portfolio management but again all those tools be
4:07:11
covered in moduel number seven so this portion we will skip we will have case study about Apple's product line
4:07:16
strategy so what were the products Apple has how many product lines they has what
4:07:22
kind of product portfolio they have so we have very good case study then uh we will understand
4:07:29
evaluating product features for customer fit
4:07:34
so the overview for this topic is we'll try to understand how best how can how
4:07:41
can we assess that how which are all the features are there which are basically fit for customer requirement so how to
4:07:47
evaluate the product and customer fit so that we will try to understand over here and then last point is strategic
4:07:54
decisions on product lines so these are the topics which we will try to cover today along with the case study from
4:08:01
Apple product features and product lines okay so what is product feature
Understanding Product Features
4:08:06
definition says a product feature is a distinctive characteristics or functionality within the product that
4:08:14
delivers a benefit to the end user features uh make up the core of what
4:08:19
product does and they drive user experience some features are critical to
4:08:25
the critical to the product's main function while other are designed to enhance experience or differentiate the
4:08:31
product from competitors it's kind of a a definition of a product feature but let's keep it simple product features is
4:08:38
basically these are the characteristics or functionality within the product which delivers benefit or value to the
4:08:43
End customer this is called as a product feature what are the different types of product features so product features can
4:08:49
be categorized into I think a b c DF six ways uh core features core features are
4:08:55
kind of essential functionalities without which uh product wouldn't serve its primary purpose these are often
4:09:02
called as must have features elements that fulfill products basic promise to the user so for example if you are
4:09:09
looking at WhatsApp message the primary feature must have feature is it should have the ability to send and receive
4:09:16
messages in messaging app this is the core feature basic feature pressing an
4:09:21
order in a food delivery application if you look at zomato or if you look at swii what is the what are the core
4:09:26
features you should be able to place order from your preferred restaurant it is the core
4:09:32
feature then you have you know secondary features these are the complimentary features complimentary to the core
4:09:38
features but they are not critical to the products fundamental use so they
4:09:43
improve user experience or offer additional convenience so for example if you take
4:09:50
at whatsapp image so having you can able to create emoji and you can share the reactions these secondary features it
4:09:56
will enhance the user experience and if you like if you look at zato or swiy
4:10:03
scheduling the delivery times okay I I would like to deliver a pizza and I want it to be delivered at 9: to 9:15 p.m. so
4:10:11
that kind of feature scheding scheduling a delivery time it is a secondary feature it's not a core feature very
4:10:17
very simple easy to understand then we have one more way to categorize the feature a differentiating features
4:10:23
features uh so basically differentiating features are set the products apart from
4:10:29
competitor so this can create a unique selling point we call it as USB and often become the reason why
4:10:37
user choose one product or another so for example if you go to Instagram
4:10:43
story features allowing users to share disappearing content it's kind of
4:10:48
differentiating feature Spotify is personalized playlist like a discovery
4:10:54
discover weekly you know weekly they refresh the list based on users
4:10:59
listening habits so it is kind of differentiating feat features so that's how Spotify differentiate itself from
4:11:06
Geo SA or other platforms or I think shitel have mentioned the
4:11:11
Netflix why it is they have the original content and personalized recommendation localized
4:11:18
content so these are differentiating characteristic of a feature uh I think this is very clear UI features so these
4:11:25
features are related to user interface and user experience while they are not add to the functionality add new
4:11:32
functionality they improve how user interact with the product making it more interative and Visually Appling so drag
4:11:38
and drop functionality for design tool for example figma they have this drag androp functional
4:11:44
um you go to you know any application they provide the dark mode application to reduce the I trrain so all those
4:11:50
things are called as the UI ux related feature again there are another ways to
4:11:55
categorize features technical features backend features so these are the hidden from end user but they are crucial for
4:12:01
product performance security and reliability or server side encryption for data privacy data security uh load
4:12:09
balancing algorithm that improves app speed and scalability so these are kind of back end features so that is another
4:12:15
way to classify it another way is called as Innovative featur so these are the new features
4:12:20
Cutting Edge features that push the boundaries of what the product can do often solve the problems that they were previously
4:12:27
unavailable so ai ai powered image recognition for in Google photos you can
4:12:33
see you know it will do the face recognition and it will tell it it can
4:12:38
create um Auto albums for your memor so that's
4:12:43
kind of innovative feature uh another example is augmented reality shopping in
4:12:49
I app so letting users to visualize Furnitures by sitting at your H by sitting at your home so this is
4:12:57
innovative features so these are the different different ways so intention here is you you will get a good idea
4:13:03
about what is product feature and what are the different types of features core features secondary feature
4:13:09
differentiating UI there is lot of overlap you know innovative can be a technical feature technical can be a
4:13:15
differentiating feature but just try to understand those terminologies because once you are product manager you should
4:13:21
be able to justify what what category of uh features you are trying to push it
4:13:27
for your product so these are the very much uh generally used terms in product
4:13:33
management World about uh categorization of features course secondary differentiating UI technical backend
4:13:40
features Innovative features understanding the Fe feature through value so customer focused features and
4:13:46
business focused features so customer focused features so these are the features directly address the needs
4:13:52
problems or uh the pinpoints of end user the value they offer should be clear and
4:13:57
directly linked to improve the users life or making task easier so these
4:14:03
features basically so let's check example one click check out feature in e-commerce reducing friction in the
4:14:10
purchasing process so single tap you know you have those uh non-touch uh credit cards if you want to do the
4:14:18
purchasing for less than 5K so this kind of customer focused features which are basically addressing
4:14:25
customer pinpoints and then you have another category called as a business focused featur so these are Fe these are the features align with products
4:14:32
business goals whether that uh are increasing Revenue customer retention or brand
4:14:38
differentiation uh it could be a subscription reminder features to reduce the churn for SAS products by alerting
4:14:45
users about upcoming renewals so you go for Amazon you go for tatasky subscription before uh once you have
4:14:52
seven days left to renew your subscription you'll get a keep you know subscription reminder so these are even
4:14:59
though they are customer F focused but if you see the intention is uh intention
4:15:04
is customer should renew their subscription so these are more towards business focused features so that's how
4:15:10
they another way to categorize the feature yeah but good I think see if you look at the way in which class discussion is
4:15:17
happening you know we have I think it will take some time or should maybe I'll take this one later there are different
4:15:23
ways in which GP makes the money I I can I can answer it yeah maybe later yeah
4:15:28
okay good so let's go to number four identifying valuable features so once you have you know uh
4:15:37
have a list of the features and then accordingly okay which are all the features are valuable so understanding
4:15:42
the customer pinpoints uh desires behaviors through surveys interviews and usability test this is what marketing D
4:15:49
does and accordingly you will get uh customer requirement and accordingly you will create a list of features parall
4:15:55
you will check what kind of features are available in competitors product by studying what features competitors
4:16:01
offers you can identify the areas where your product can innovate or differentiate itself and the data
4:16:07
conditions features that uses metrix uh and user feedback provide critic iCal
4:16:13
insights into which features are most valuable and where improvements can be
4:16:18
can be made so essentially you launched a product and you would like to see which features are valuable for the End
4:16:25
customer so straight away I would say use Google analytics you access for your application to Google analytics Google
4:16:31
analytics can tell you in a month how many times this feature has been used So
4:16:37
based on that you can able to clearly identify that okay which are all the features customer perceiving as valuable
4:16:44
from their perspective even though you know before developing that feature you have done all those Market survey
4:16:49
understood customer requirement but once you have launched the product you would like to check okay whether customer is
4:16:56
seeing the value or not that's where you can do the kpi based analysis and you can check whether really customers are
4:17:02
seeing the value and one of the way to check that one is how many times customers are using that feature so
4:17:09
usage per customer and number of customers so we have again multiple kpi matrices uh Apu and all those things so
4:17:17
based on those kpis we can check we can able to clearly Define how many of those available features are valuable from
4:17:23
customer perspective feature prioritization uh again we have multiple
4:17:28
models which we are going to talk in the next next slide so just to give overview
4:17:34
not all features or should be developed at once because you have limited resources prioritizing the feature is
4:17:40
very very important and product manager is the one who will decide which features to be implemented in that
4:17:45
particular product and uh what are the variables he will see what kind of value it is adding to the customer what kind
4:17:51
of value it is adding to your business and the feasibility is the feature is
4:17:56
realistic with current resources timelines and technology and based on that he will have the assessment and
4:18:02
again based on that he will create a list of features to be implemented in a given product but future prioritization
4:18:09
models we are going to discuss in next slides overall what is the life cycle of a feature so ideation you know
4:18:17
brainstorming the new feature based on customer needs market trends competitive analysis it's the ideation phase once
4:18:24
you decided that okay you understood customer requirements you design the feature you do the development how will
4:18:29
you do it you create a prototype you can have MVP you cannot have MVP based on
4:18:35
the scope of that feature and you'll gather the feedback and based on that you will finalize which some of the
4:18:40
Prototype ideas to be included into the final product then you launch the
4:18:45
feature releasing the feature to users and prompting promoting it to ensure
4:18:51
adoption and optimization once you actually launch it once you user actually started using it based on the
4:18:58
user feedback you will optimize it but at the end last point is feature documentation to ensure Clarity and
4:19:04
Alignment feature should be documented in in the form of user stories technical specifications or wireframe diagram uh
4:19:11
this helps communicate the vision and details of the feature to the development team stakeholders and
4:19:16
designers not only about features so all the things what you do as a product manager you should have a very good
4:19:22
documentation about uh if you make a decisions please document it please document the justification because those
4:19:28
things will be very very important if you want to go back and check why you made a decision for your product so
4:19:34
these are you know top level information about the feature but let's now try to go in detail and check how typically
4:19:41
product manager do the feature prioritize ation understanding the feature product feature prioritization
Product Feature Prioritization
4:19:47
so feuture prioritization is a critical aspect of a product manager as we discussed as it helps team to decide
4:19:53
which features to develop first based on their potential impact alignment with the business goals these are there are
4:19:59
multiple Frameworks available for prioritization couple of Frameworks are as follows basically the first one is
4:20:05
Moscow method wherein m stands for must have S stands for should have C stands
4:20:11
for could have and W stands for won't have for now so
4:20:17
must is feature that are essential for product to work without them product
4:20:22
cannot function yes basically important features but not a critical I should be
4:20:29
included but uh can be deprioritized you know if there are some constraints could
4:20:35
have features that are kind of a nice to have but not necessarily they can be considered if time and resources allows
4:20:42
and and W basically feature that are not at all relevant to the current iteration
4:20:48
but might be considered for f for future for future scope so this is the
4:20:53
framework called as mosco method let's try to understand you know with the help of uh e-commerce application let's take
4:20:59
example of Amazon Prime uh must have uh what you should have user registration
4:21:06
feature should have a login without this one user cannot access the app they cannot place the order product search
4:21:13
you know uh Amazon you are expected to have a good search features ability for
4:21:18
users to search the products because it is the core functionality I should have
4:21:24
you know should have is uh product reviews and ratings this features add value while by helping users to make
4:21:31
informed purchasing decisions but it is not a critical for the apps
4:21:37
functionality uh you know it could be you have you know cart as a feature wish list user should be able to save
4:21:43
products for latter but uh the app can't app can function without having a card
4:21:48
function card functionality So This falls under should have a could have
4:21:54
basically a social sharing uh sharing uh letting users share products on social
4:22:00
media is nice to have features but not essential for apps scoree functionality
4:22:05
uh multiple payments options add convenience but it is not critical as long as basic payments options are
4:22:11
available as long as you know use support UPI it's good enough Amazon pay
4:22:16
or you know PTM wallet based payment could have you know better to have if at all doesn't have it's okay
4:22:23
not a big problem won't have for now augmented reality product visualization uh it's always recommended
4:22:31
to become to be Innovative but it is not necessary at this point of time for initial launch you can think of AR based
4:22:39
feature in future in basically as a part of future scope so augmented reality
4:22:44
based feature is called considered as a won't have so that's how you categorize e-commerce bestas features must have
4:22:51
should have could have won't have so when do we when product manager will use this Fe you know this mod this method so
4:22:59
you as a product manager just imagine a scenario you want to develop a new product development you have created a
4:23:05
survey you asked marketing team okay go and talk to and customer try to understand their pinpoint areas so
4:23:10
marketing team went and they create kind of captured customer pinpoint areas based on that you you analyze those
4:23:17
pinpoint areas and you came up with a feature list okay this feature solves this pinpoint area this Feature Feature
4:23:24
one solves pinpoint area one feature two solves pinpoint area two and now you
4:23:29
have big list of features but you can't start development and you can't Implement all the features in your
4:23:34
product so as a product manager you need to prioritize it and this is the framework wherein you will decide which
4:23:41
features to be prioritized go for must have if all the features if still you have resources go for should have still
4:23:48
you have resources go for could have that's the priority you should you need to follow very subjective analysis musco
4:23:55
method okay let's go to next framework I like this one uh rice scoring because
4:24:02
this is uh more objective you know being a engineering background I like working
4:24:07
with numbers and Moscow if you see subjec you for I think it is must have
4:24:14
but you know you I you might think it is it it falls under should have category so there is a good amount of
4:24:20
subjectivity in Moscow method but if you look at Rice model it has actual numbers
4:24:26
so let's try to understand what does r i stands for so R stands for reach I
4:24:33
stands for impact C stands for confidence and E stands for effort so
4:24:38
it's a data driven framework designed to objectively prioritize feature based on scoring models so rich what what is the
4:24:46
meaning of Rich how many users or customers will the feature impact
4:24:52
measured by number of users transactions or uh sessions affected so it talks about absolute
4:24:59
count how many users are going to use these features second point the impact
4:25:04
how much impact will this feature have on the user experience or overall business goals typically you know you
4:25:11
can categorize impact from 0 to 5 or 0 to 10 you can have your
4:25:18
own skill but you have to be consistent and uh they say you know the what do you
4:25:24
call the resolution is 0. five but typically it's very difficult to
4:25:29
categorize okay 1.25 versus 1.5 so what typically industry does is when they use
4:25:35
this rice model is they they use resolution as 0.5 not 0.25 so 1.5 2 2.5
4:25:41
3 3.5 4 so and and so forth so impact how much impact will this feature has on
4:25:47
user experience on or on business goals next factor is confidence how
4:25:54
confident are you in the accuracy of your reach and impact estimates uh so it is the percentage
4:26:01
value so 80 percentage indicates strong confidence so you might have you know
4:26:06
you might have some assumptions when you calculate the reach and impact so you are expected to put the idence value so
4:26:13
again it will take out the subjectivity so you might have so you you might have
4:26:19
some assumptions okay how many customers are going to use this features so I have my assumptions I feel that uh my
4:26:25
forecasted data shows that I might get 100 new customers per month because if I
4:26:31
launch this feature but that might not be accurate so my question to be asked is how much confident are you in terms
4:26:37
of percentage that 100 customers you are going to get Bylo implementing this new features so that's where that
4:26:44
objectivity subjectivity is removed by adding the confidence Factor as a c and
4:26:49
the last one is effort how much work is required to implement these features so how much resources are required in terms
4:26:56
of manpowersupply.est
4:27:01
[Music]
4:27:12
for data driven teams that want balanced high impact features with their development
4:27:18
efforts so that's the concept to give one example so let's take example of uh
4:27:24
task management app Remember sopia in know first case study she was she has
4:27:29
developed a product which was focusing on Project man management applications similar category task management
4:27:36
application and they decided that okay I would like to develop this feature task
4:27:41
management feature uh task management application and it will have three features uh first feature is Task
4:27:47
reminder project template and advanced reporting so let's take case of task
4:27:53
reminder and uh the thing is if I implement this feature I can expect that
4:28:00
800 users will get benefited because of this feature the impact of this feature is I feel there is a strong impact I
4:28:08
given the rating as three because it address uh kind of a basic paino from
4:28:14
customer perspective there is a lot of need in the market for task reminders so
4:28:19
impact is considered as three and I'm fairly confident that I my estimate estimates are correct because I have
4:28:24
done thorough research I have good data which justify that my reach numbers and impact numbers are fairly accurate and
4:28:31
then I worked with engineering team I checked okay how much efforts are required in order to implement this task
4:28:37
reminder feature in my task management application then I feel that it needs um
4:28:43
two person weeks you know one person working for two weeks I can able to develop this feature develop testing
4:28:50
everything so efforts required two person weeks so accordingly uh task reminder with highest basically I I have
4:28:57
the score as 1080 and then if I do the similar analysis for project templates
4:29:02
Advanced reporting I get similar rice scor and based on these things I find
4:29:08
that uh task reminder should be the first feature which we should prioritize followed by project template followed by
4:29:15
Advanced reporting this is widely being used framework across uh many companies
4:29:21
many Industries I would say because it is very much uh objective and uh people
4:29:28
like objective data r i how to calculate R scores methods Frameworks coming in
4:29:35
next slide but uh before going to that okay so let's go to number three it's a
4:29:41
Koo model very I think not very much different than that of mosco model so here Koo
4:29:47
model helps prioritize the features by categorizing them on customer satisfaction and the degree of
4:29:53
implementation so divides feature into five categories the first one is the basic needs uh here if you compare it
4:30:00
with Moscow it is M must features these are the features uh user expects and the
4:30:06
and and if they are their absence leads to a dissatisfaction basic features one of the examples security stability and
4:30:13
all those things what we discussed here basic features must have then second category what Koo says is performance
4:30:19
needs so the more of these features you provide the more satisfied customers
4:30:24
will be you know faster hold loading times better performance so these are performance related
4:30:30
features third one is excitement needs um falls under Delight category features
4:30:37
that user don't expect but would love when they are present
4:30:42
Innovative surp surpassing features So This falls under Delight category which
4:30:48
Falls which basically C the excitement needs of a customer next one are indifferent features so these features
4:30:54
don't significantly impact uh satisfaction and the last one is the
4:31:00
reverse features so features that can actually lead to dissatisfaction it present so it's like a feature overload
4:31:08
too many tabs on the on the home home screen too many unnecessary
4:31:14
notifications it is reverse features so in cono you have a category called as a reverse feature which basically tells
4:31:20
that don't have category you should not be implementing this one use case cono model particularly useful for balancing
4:31:27
user expectations and identifying delighter features that can give competitive ede so let's take couple of
4:31:35
example so must be the basic uh video playback so essential features without
4:31:41
without this one app is unusable uh performance HD streaming you
4:31:47
know if you are giving the HD streaming feature compatibility so it is
4:31:53
Performance Based performance related features so the more you provide the happier user B excitement feature uh you
4:32:00
know like kind of you can able to download the videos for offline viewing
4:32:06
it is uh fall Center Delight category it is unexpected but highly appreciated by
4:32:11
user users in different uh customer themes for UI user don't care much
4:32:17
whether the feature is present or not if it is there good to have if it is not there it's okay user can able to manage
4:32:23
it's not a specific demand from user that I would like to customize my theme for user interface and reverse autop
4:32:31
playing next video so here they are telling okay some users don't like autoplay it is like annoying for them so
4:32:38
this leads to dissatisfaction so please don't Implement uh autop playing feature
4:32:43
so this is the way in which they categorize the feature and uh basically
4:32:49
they go for must have followed by performance followed by excitement so that's the priority they use it
4:32:55
indifferent and reverse indiff if at all the resources available go for Indi
4:33:00
otherwise don't go for Indi so video playback as we discuss this feature must be features user expects video playback
4:33:08
without it they would be extremely dissatisfied uh download for offline
4:33:14
application this is excitement feature user may not expect this but when it is present it significantly boost the
4:33:20
satisfaction result platform should focus on must be features followed by performance followed by excitement so
4:33:27
that's the priority so this is another way in which you can categorize it uh not very much famous mostly people use
4:33:35
Moscow or rice no okay I think whatever we can able to do it in Moscow same
4:33:41
thing you can able to do it in Koo also okay another another methodology I would say and this is another one it is uh it
4:33:50
is called as value versus complexity Impact versus effort so let's try to understand uh last Model fourth one uh
4:33:57
value versus complexity this is very very I think this is widely being used you know everybody will have you know
4:34:04
very good understanding about what kind of value it is adding to the customer and what is the complexity of developing
4:34:09
this one the framework plots the feature on Matrix that compares the potential
4:34:15
business or user value against the complexity or efforts required to implement it so value versus efforts The
4:34:21
Matrix divided into four quadrants you know
4:34:27
so okay in fact I can I cannot draw now so let's imagine uh 2x two Matrix one
4:34:33
vertical line one horizontal line and um the top right side is whereing both
4:34:41
both axes are high high wherein it calls as uh big bet so the definition of big
4:34:47
bet is high value High effort so these are important but require significant
4:34:52
Investments because these are going to add lot of value but it requires lot of investment so second quadrant wherein
4:35:00
the value is uh high but the efforts are low complexity is low so it is called as
4:35:06
quick win wherein the value is very high but the efforts required to implement are very low so so this should be
4:35:12
prioritized first because these are kind of uh high value addition with very low
4:35:17
efforts so prioritize it get it implemented the next one is quadrant number three wherein the value is low
4:35:24
low low basically value what what value we are going to add is also low and the effort required to implement it is also
4:35:31
low so these are kind of a low low it is called as a low hanging fruit so this can be added if time permits if there is
4:35:38
no extra resources you can eliminate them and the the last one is uh you are going to add very low value but it
4:35:44
requires lot of efforts in order to implement this feature so the terminology is money pits so they should
4:35:51
be avoided so that's how they kind of categorized all features into four
4:35:57
category a quick win high value low complexity go for it prioritize them big
4:36:04
bets wherein the value is high but the complexity is very low so custom
4:36:10
workflow let's take example of project management uh so drag and drop kind of feature value is very high people would
4:36:18
like to use this feature and complexity is very low drag and drop developing a drag drag and drop feature won't take
4:36:23
more uh engineering resources so it falls under quick win uh let's take case
4:36:28
of custom workflow so customized workflow for individual users so value is very high I would like to use I would
4:36:35
like to see a customized workflow for my requirement but in order to develop a customized workflow feature it it takes
4:36:41
lot of efforts So This falls under big bet wherein these are important but this needs significant amount of efforts uh
4:36:48
low low basically low hanging fruits color coded labels you know the value is low if it is there it's okay if it is
4:36:55
not there who cares complexity is also low so if you have additional efforts additional resources go for low low
4:37:01
category low hanging fruit and the next one is AI powered task
4:37:07
assignment wherein um if I have ai D task assignment does it add lot of value
4:37:14
okay it's add some value but not a lot but you know I need to incorporate AI based algorithm the efforts required are
4:37:21
very high so I don't want to implement it so that's this is another way in which you can categorize it so quick wi
4:37:27
drag and drop high value user can easily rearrange the task and low complexity easy to implement it big bets custom
4:37:34
workflow high value but requires significant development making it more strategic longterm investment money pits
4:37:41
AI task it's highly complex but doesn't add significant value and result focus
4:37:46
on quick wins high value low efforts uh basically focus on quick wins go for uh
4:37:53
high value low complexity followed by big Bits And if at all resources are available go for low hanging fruit but
4:38:00
try to avoid Money Pit so this is the another way of classification but so we have seen three
4:38:08
models mosow Koo and uh value versus complexity all of three are very
4:38:15
subjective based on subjective analysis of a product manager and rice which is very much objective I would prefer rice
4:38:22
but again it depends upon individuals choices and individuals scenario where they would like to use it but uh if as
4:38:29
long as you know how to use it you have to use uh at least one of them in your
4:38:35
project and when you are a product manager working as a product manager you should have good grip or at least one of
4:38:43
the framework so that you can you can consistently use it simple 2x2 matrix on
4:38:49
one axis low value high value Y axis low complexity High complexity and
4:38:55
accordingly you categorized big feature list into these four four uh quadrants and just to go
4:39:02
back to PR's question what kind of information I need so in order to start
4:39:08
actually working on this model you need to have the information about what kind of value it is adding to the End customer and you have to have the
4:39:13
feedback from engineering team about the complexity of implementing this feature so once you have these things you can
4:39:19
able to start working on this model so to summarize Moscow focuses on
4:39:24
Essentials versus nice to have features rice uses data driven scoring model for feature
4:39:30
prioritization Koo priorities prioritizes based on user satisfaction and expectation value versus complexity
4:39:37
balances feature value against complexity of implementation so it's up to you which one you would like to use
4:39:42
it but these are uh the most famous four models for future prioritization in
4:39:48
product management uh Community okay so now let's see the
4:39:54
designing product features and specifications okay so is what we are trying to learn here is that okay we
4:40:01
understood feature prioritization but how do you come up until feature prioritization so capturing product
Designing Product Features and Specifications
4:40:07
features and specifications from voice of customer is a critical process for a product manager to ensure that product
4:40:13
meets the customer expectations customer needs so voice of customer it's again a very well-known terminology in product
4:40:20
management World VOC Vice of customer Vice of customer refers to Gathering feedback insights and preferences
4:40:25
directly from customers to understand their desires their pinpoint you know their expectations uh by using Insight by
4:40:33
using these insights product manager can create a feature that uh resonates with user and align with business objectives
4:40:40
so the first step in developing any product or any feature is uh marketing
4:40:45
team will work with the end customers in order to capture the customer pain points so what are the different ways in
4:40:52
which uh marketing marketing team will collect the voice of customer is um customer interviews you know conducting
4:40:59
one-on-one customer interviews to understand customer pinpoints their expectations you know what kind of
4:41:04
desired features they would like to have in your product uh typically they go for open-ended questions you know uh
4:41:11
customers to freely Express their needs so what kind of questions they ask you know what challenges do you face with
4:41:17
the current generation products and they will ask basically okay they will listen then and they will record their what
4:41:23
kind of information or answer they are giving so that's the customer interviews second one is a surveys and questioners
4:41:30
use structured surveys to ask targeted questions about uh product usage desired
4:41:35
features customer satisfactions survey can be distributed via email via in applications or social media so what
4:41:42
features you would like to see in our next update so in surveys you can have you know open-ended question where you
4:41:48
will give a space where in customer can write their subjective feedback plus you can have some you know objectives
4:41:54
basically options also option a option b option C and last option could be if something else please type it so like
4:42:00
that you create a survey you are you basically along with marketing TV will create a survey float that survey and
4:42:05
you seek input from customer that's second way third one is focus group organize a small group uh discussions
4:42:13
with the target users to gather the qualitative insights on the product features usability and area of
4:42:19
improvement focus group help identify shared user experiences and pinpoints so
4:42:27
typically focus group uh they involve uh the customers who knows about the product current generation product very
4:42:34
well and who would like to help your organization on providing the expectation for our new generation
4:42:39
product uh customer feedback it could be either in app or in online customer
4:42:44
collects the feedback uh collect the C feedback directly within the app through feedback forms on your website this
4:42:51
method captures the realtime opinions on the product features or experiences user
4:42:56
can leave feedback on specified features as would recommend would you recommend
4:43:02
this product what would you make it better so you know you can have this
4:43:08
kind of questions and then your customer can provide the feedback back in fact your current generation product reviews
4:43:14
on current generation product also will will help a lot you'll try to understand which are all those areas where in
4:43:20
customer is not happy at least you have that information customer might not say you might not get the information about
4:43:26
what your would like state to be however those features wherein customer is not happy dissatisfied you can have those
4:43:33
list of features which you can incorporate in developing New Generation products again you can go for social
4:43:39
media listening you know monitor uh discussions on social platforms like Twitter
4:43:45
LinkedIn um ready to capture the unfiltered customer opinions and Trends
4:43:51
around your product example track mention of your product and analyze customer comments and complaints so you
4:43:58
ask um particular person to talk about your product and then just go through what kind of comments he's getting it's
4:44:05
a good way to get uh unfiltered feedback so the important word word here is unfiltered customer opinions
4:44:11
so here the major majority of the thing is most of the cases you don't get a genuine customer feedback because
4:44:19
marketing team or somebody will uh sugarcoat it or they will alter it so
4:44:24
product manager should always ask unfiltered customer feedback because that will give lot of information more
4:44:32
insights than modified one or you know kind of sugar CED customer support
4:44:37
tickets analyze the recurring issues and feedbacks received at customer support team you have current generation product
4:44:43
similar to what I have mentioned for product reviews on uh Google platform or
4:44:50
um Google Playlist platform or some other platforms similarly you can have very good insights from your customer
4:44:56
service team you can check with them what kind of issues you are getting frequent issues you are getting more
4:45:01
from customers and what's the level of frustration from customer on that feature so customer often reports
4:45:09
problems missing features through their through this customer support channels they also marketing team also
4:45:16
have this net promoter score NPS survey NPS survey to gauge the customer satisfaction and understand what uh
4:45:25
detractors and proot are saying about the product on a
4:45:30
scale of 1 to 10 how likely you would recommend our product to your friend so such kind of questions are conver
4:45:38
covered in the surveys and you will ask the rating from 1 to then in fact you have the possibility to add descriptive
4:45:44
answers product reviews and rating as we discussed uh user analytics user uh
4:45:49
usage pattern so through Google analytics I think somebody was mentioning about mix panel so you can
4:45:55
take a reference of those platforms and you can check what kind of comments you are getting what kind of suggestions you are getting so essentially you will do
4:46:02
all those things in order to capture a v voiceof customer so this is the first
4:46:08
trigger for a product manager you will ask marketing team to all do all those things and you'll you'll capture V from
4:46:15
different different platforms and uh that basically completes this stage step
4:46:20
number one collecting the voice of customer so this is how you have collected voice of customer and uh
4:46:27
analyzing and interpreting the voice of customer data so once voice of customer data is collected product manager need
4:46:34
to analiz it to extract valuable insights about customer needs and translate them into actionable product
4:46:40
Fe features and specifications so how he does it as I told you know identify
4:46:46
patterns and Trends group a similar feedback from multiple customers to identify common pinpoints features
4:46:52
request or areas of improvement for instance in many uh users are asking for
4:46:58
better search functionality it becomes a key Insight so what is expected in that report 50% of users mentioned difficult
4:47:05
difficulty in finding the product using the current search function so this is the uh insight what you are getting from
4:47:11
vof customer where you are putting the actual numbers okay a good amount of customers are complaining about your
4:47:17
current uh search functionality second so that's how you have create gone through the details and you have created
4:47:23
a patterns and Trends second point is categorize the feedback organize the feedback into categories such as uh okay
4:47:30
usability issues are categorized somewhere feature related requests somewhere bug fixes somewhere in one
4:47:37
more one category and this helps in prioritizing the area of a focus so
4:47:42
organize the feedback in categories like performance issues feature request ease of use bug fixes like that you can
4:47:49
create a multiple categories for those feedback then third one is the prioritize user problem not all customer
4:47:56
requests are equal identify the most impactful problems that align with uh
4:48:01
business goals use prioritization Frameworks you know is about you know what we learned mosow to decide which
4:48:08
features should be tackled first so it's about once you have the feature list how to prioritize it that's that's what we
4:48:14
have learned in last last section segment feedback by user Persona that's
4:48:20
another way different customer segments have different needs segment feedback based on user persona for example power
4:48:27
users versus new users Enterprise application versus uh uh retail
4:48:33
customers to understand how their needs vary example power users request more
4:48:38
advanced reporting while new users wants a simple onboarding process so this is
4:48:44
another way of categorizing it so I got a feedback from corporate customer and I
4:48:50
get this feedback I got a customer feedback from retail customer I got this feedback so accordingly you can able to
4:48:55
create a feature and in the note section you can put okay this feature is focused on corporate application this feature is
4:49:01
focused on um retail applications what is expected from product manager is you
4:49:06
should do a quantitative analysis from service quantitative analysis to me measure the relative importance of a
4:49:12
feature satisfaction levels frequency of a certain request you can use tools like
4:49:18
a Google forms Survey Monkey who can provide this information and um qualitative analysis also basically
4:49:24
you're going through the interviews group focus group discussions use uh thematic analysis to identify recurring
4:49:30
themes and suggestions in interview data uh you can use softwares like uh NBO or
4:49:37
Dil can help categorize the qualitative data so essentially what you are trying to do
4:49:43
is that whatever data you captured you are analyzing it and trying to understand the impact you are creating a pattern you are categorizing them and uh
4:49:51
based on that you you coming up with a list of features which needs to be implemented and which needs to be
4:49:57
prioritized and once priority is defined you will take it forward as I discussed with mujib that once you decided that I
4:50:05
would like to implement this top 10 features followed with uh Vision document once vision is approved when
4:50:10
you got approval for your product you will start working with engineering team in order to develop those uh features
4:50:17
then again divided into multiple Sprints each Sprints will have some features and
4:50:23
now when it comes to actual implementation you would like to refine the problem statement wherein you will
4:50:29
again go back to marketing team and check what kind of uh further details they can able to provide which will be
4:50:35
helpful in order to come up with the right feature specifications which we are going to talk in the next slide
4:50:41
however is it clear how to collect the data and how to analyze the voice of
4:50:46
customer data now you got voice of customer you have you know kind of categorized it created a summary
4:50:52
clusters patterns now how are you going to translate them into product features
4:50:58
and specifications after analyzing voice of customer product manager translate customer needs into actionable product
4:51:04
features and detail specifications this process involves breaking down insights into specific product functionalities
4:51:11
so step how are you going to do it step number one identify the core problem or the need after Gathering the feedback
4:51:17
next step is to identify the core problem or the need that feedback sorry is pointing to problem identified
4:51:25
customers are suggesting to track a task and deadlines leading to miss deadlines
4:51:31
and decreased productivity so then they need a way to they need a a way to be reminded of a
4:51:39
task and quickly checks on approaching deadlines a kind of reminder task
4:51:45
reminder so you understood the customer feedback that they they need a way to
4:51:51
remind of the task and um once it on there is a deadline basically there
4:51:57
should be a some kind of message so like that you identified the
4:52:03
problem next step is Define the user story that's what I think muj discussing
4:52:08
once you have developed a problem once you understood the problem statement you have to represent that problem statement
4:52:15
in terms of a customer language so they call it as a user story a user story are
4:52:21
the short simple descriptive description of a feature from users perspective this is the very simple definition of user
4:52:27
story this is short this is very simple description of a feature from users perspective they help product managers
4:52:35
clearly Define what customer wants to achieve with this product or with this feature so typical user stories are as a
4:52:42
team leader I want to receive notification for upcoming task deadline so that I can so that I don't miss them
4:52:49
or another example is I want to view all task with approaching deadlines so that
4:52:54
I can prioritize them so it is a singles a short oneliner sentence which defines
4:53:00
exactly what's the customer need so developing a user story is very very crucial because this is kind of uh you
4:53:07
got lot of feedbacks you have done lot of analysis and this is the outcome coming up with a user story from a voice
4:53:13
of customer is important and that's where product manager will play very important role he will define those user
4:53:19
stories once user story is defined uh the next point is creating a feature
4:53:25
requirement So based on user stories product manager can define specific feature needed to solve the identified
4:53:32
problem so this is the user story this is the problem statement so he will decide he will Define the feature which
4:53:38
will solve this problem problem statement which is defined in the user story these are the requirements or
4:53:44
functionality that describe what the feature will do so for example for this user story feature requirement for task
4:53:51
reminder the feature requirement is notification the system should or will automatically send reminder notification
4:53:59
to the task owner and assign two days before the task is due this is a feature
4:54:04
customizable reminder so user can set the customizable reminder request can be
4:54:09
customized be two hours it could be one day two days one week before so it should be customizable and basically a
4:54:16
due date view on the dashboard you should have a dashboard you know when all tasks are soled by a due date with
4:54:23
the task due date soon highlighted as the top of the list so these are a top feature level feature requirements so
4:54:32
let me go back you have conducted marketing survey documents your marketing survey you conducted marketing
4:54:37
interview conducted your analyze. customer feedback put it in different clusters and basically you understood
4:54:45
the core problem statement or first problem statement I would say and to Define that problem statement you came
4:54:51
up with the user story user story is a simple oneliner statement about what is that uh feature from users perspective
4:54:59
and then uh you are creating a Feature Feature name is Task reminder and uh you
4:55:05
came up with the feature requirements a notification customizable reminder and due dat View this is how you convert uh
4:55:12
voice of customer into user story from user story to features and from features
4:55:18
to feature requirements in your respective Capstone project it is expected that uh you will capture the
4:55:24
voice of customer and uh you identify the patterns Trends categorize that
4:55:30
feedback based on based on that you know come up with a problem statement come up with the user Story come up with a
4:55:35
feature and come up with feature requirements let me go to the next step step number four so now fourth number
4:55:41
step we are going one step further detail it is about detail specifications
4:55:46
okay and uh now it's time to break down the feature requirement into detail specifications that design team and
4:55:52
development team will follow to build the feature example of a task reminder feature so for example feature name is
4:55:59
Task reminder functionality is the system will automatically send a push
4:56:04
notification and an email to user for task approaching their due dates default
4:56:10
reminder is 2 days before the due date see they have mentioned the default value is two days before the due date
4:56:16
option of user to configure the reminder for configurable options are one day or one week before the due R so there are
4:56:23
two only two configurable options are expected so this is the core functionality what is expected in user
4:56:29
interface fun basically in UI you should have a dashboard view a task approaching
4:56:35
the due date will be highlighted in yellow the upcoming task sections will list all the tasks sorted by due dat uh
4:56:42
with the soonest first earliest first on the top basically this is about the dashboard view UI notification sending
4:56:50
user can go to the setting and select setting setting setting section to
4:56:55
customize when they receive the reminders so like that you have to customize functionality what you
4:57:01
mentioned you have to create a UI for that customize section go to settings create this particular button uh click
4:57:07
this particular button and accordingly change the value to either to one day or one week notification example a reminder
4:57:14
task prepare project report in two days so this is kind of a sample example you are giving reminder task prepare project
4:57:21
report due in two days so this kind of notification you will get it so this is UI related uh details you have mentioned
4:57:29
so you written on top functionality details you have written UI related details now let's see performance related details notification delivery
4:57:36
should occur within 1 second of the reminder Trigger Time notification delivery should occur within 1 second of
4:57:43
the reminder Trigger Time reminders must reach 95% of the users without failure
4:57:50
so this is the expected so for example there are 100 users because of some issues in your functionality it might
4:57:57
happen that 5 percentage of the users things are not working properly but uh on a top level it is expected that at
4:58:03
least 90% 95% of the people uh you should you should be able to provide the
4:58:08
reminder acccept acceptance criteria notifications are successfully sent to all the users for task due in two days
4:58:17
uh user can customize the timing of a notification and receive the reminders based on their preferences so this is
4:58:23
the acceptance criteria H case h Cas basically what is the meaning of h case
4:58:28
so these are the scenarios what happens if the user email address is incorrect or invalid so show the error message in
4:58:36
the notification setting if the system cannot send an email due to in valid address so these are kind of things
4:58:43
wherein if things doesn't go well what kind of error message you would like to show a scenario what happens if the task
4:58:49
due date is changed after reminder has already been sent the system will cancel the original reminder and send a new one
4:58:55
p on the updated due date and dependencies this feature is dependent upon existing notification service
4:59:02
requires integration with u user profile system for customer reminders so these
4:59:09
are uh detail customer detail specifications so what I say uh for step
4:59:17
number four product manager will so it is not whole and so responsibility of product manager to understand the to
4:59:23
write the detail specifications he will get help from engineering team because they have the template what is the
4:59:28
functionality what are the requirements for UI what are the performance related requirements what is the success
4:59:34
criteria acceptance criteria what are the different age cases dependencies so
4:59:39
product manager will closely work with the engineering team in order to develop a detail specifications however for step
4:59:46
number one two and three specifically for voice of customers and creating a
4:59:51
summary product manager will work closely with um you know marketing team ba team and all those guys um but
4:59:58
defining user story creating uh features and top level feature requirements it is
5:00:04
expected that product manager will do these things so for step number one
5:00:10
product manager will closely work with the marketing business analyst BD accounts team step number two again
5:00:18
product manager will get help from these guys same guys who have mentioned as a part of stakeholders for step number one
5:00:25
but uh step number three product manager is the responsible identify core problem Define the user story creating a top
5:00:32
level feature requirements I would say product manager will do it and once top level requirements are developed product
5:00:38
manager will work closely with engineering team in order to identify lowlevel requirements it is also called
5:00:44
as a detailed specifications where in what is the functionality UI related details
5:00:49
performance related details acceptance criteria H case dependencies all those things are in detail captured so this is
5:00:57
called as a engineering specifications detail
5:01:03
specifications so this is the Journey of a feature is it clear designing product
5:01:08
features and specification this is important core roles and responsibilities of product manager this
5:01:14
is where this is how putting the features prioritization vision and then actual development starts just try to
5:01:20
understand you know how critical these steps are there you know if you if you decided that okay I want only two
5:01:27
customizable options and uh because of some user feedback and once you launch
5:01:33
the product and you'll will see a kind of a negative comment that customizable options are only two I want it to be
5:01:39
further customized for hourly basis so that's where uh you have to
5:01:45
check what kind of quality of your customer survey so everything boils down to step number one what is the quality
5:01:51
of uh voice of customer data you collected so this is the foundation I would say for products try to understand
5:01:58
the customer pulse if this is not going well then rest of the things are
5:02:05
dependent upon step number one next point is evaluating product features for customer fit yeah it's a small thing I
Evaluating Product Features for Customer Fit
5:02:12
think not a big deal it talks about okay how best you are fitting the customer requirement once you launched the
5:02:18
product so analyze the how how success of your product checking you know the
5:02:24
features what you have selected are they meeting the customer needs or not so analyze uh how do you do it analyze
5:02:31
usage data and matri so post launch analyze product usage data to evaluate how well these features are meeting the
5:02:36
customer needs you have the kpis you know monitor matrices like a user how many what kind of user engagement
5:02:44
ratings are there how many people feature what is the feature adoption rate customer satisfaction course so by
5:02:51
looking at those kpis you can able to check uh whether whatever features you have shortlisted prioritized are meeting
5:02:58
the customer requirement or not and does it Define customer fit for example analyze the percentage of user utilizing
5:03:04
the task reminder feature versus those who signed up for the tool so it might happen that you know you have multiple
5:03:11
people who have signed up for the tool they have downloaded your application uh but nobody's using your
5:03:17
feature task reminder feature so try to check from Google analytics profile analytics from product analytics about
5:03:25
those KS and it will define whether it is customer fit or not fit customer support feedback review customer support
5:03:31
tickets and feedback to identify recurring issues requested related to specific features it may if many users
5:03:39
report confus about using task assignment features it may indicate that they need additional onboarding
5:03:46
adjustment I'll give you one example very interesting example I it was the case of during
5:03:52
[Music] 2016 data Motors has launched a vehicle
5:03:57
you might have known Tata Arya a AI at that time Cyrus mystery was the chairman
5:04:03
of Tata group and it was basically his baby tya they have used all all high fund
5:04:10
features you know one of the feature was uh which was not at all available in
5:04:15
India for most of the companies one of the feature was uh rain detection sensor
5:04:21
so ideally you know if it is raining you will manually trigger the Vipers so in
5:04:27
2016 data Motors has launched this feature wherein automatically it will detect the rain detection Rain by using
5:04:33
the r detection sensor and automatically it will trigger the wipers uh but it was not properly communicated to End
5:04:40
customer and when vehicle was launched we we get lot of complaints that Viper is
5:04:45
misfunctioning even if I don't give a command still it is automatically triggering so that basically talks about
5:04:53
uh customers were not expecting these features either one second one is okay we find that there is value for this
5:05:00
feature accordingly we developed it we implemented it but we failed to communicate the information to customer
5:05:06
it could be a issue from sales team but this was overall failure for that features so that was one of the case
5:05:12
wherein uh we look at whether the customer product feature and customer fit so that's where it talks about the
5:05:19
feature and customer fit whether they go hand in hand or not so that is one way of capturing the checking whether
5:05:26
customer Feit is there or not and then you capture this information itate and improve based on feedback based on
5:05:32
customer feedback usage data iterate on the feature to enhance the customer Feit
5:05:38
identify areas of improvement analyze the feedback to determine where features may fall short or what improvements can
5:05:44
be made example if user finds a task uh
5:05:50
assignment feature is too complex consider you know making it more simplify the GUI add kind of uh tool
5:05:57
tips notifications some kind of demo training guidance Implement those
5:06:02
changes make necessary adjustment to the features based on user insights ensure that your satisfaction will improve
5:06:09
again this is very continuous process continuous feedback loop finally establish a continuous feedback loop in
5:06:14
order to ensure that ongoing alignments with customer NS regularly have a check-in conduct a regular check-in with
5:06:20
customers gather the feedback not only customers basically you can get those customer feedback reports from Google
5:06:26
analytics or from some other platform and accordingly you have to develop and R it conclusion is evaluating product
5:06:33
feature for customer fit involves a structured approach that begins with understanding customer personas needs in
5:06:40
the features to those needs features versus customer needs you have to have that Matrix and validating the features
5:06:46
through feedback and data analysis by continuously iterating and engaging with customer product managers can ensure
5:06:52
that their product remains aligned with customer expectations and it will remain competitive and relevant into the market
5:06:58
but again further details about what are those kpis how to generate a customer
5:07:03
feedback report we are going to study in product analytics moduel but overall as
5:07:09
a product manager once product is launched how to check whether we are in line or not look for customer feedback
5:07:16
you'll get insights and accordingly you can check whether whatever you have developed and launched is does it follow
5:07:21
as per the customer expectation or not is a small one pager on this topic customer evaluating product feature and
5:07:28
customer fit just a quick info guys intellipath offers product management course training through this course you

5:08:04
the first step towards career growth in the field of product management again uh there are couple of small small Concepts
5:08:10
we'll try to understand first one is product mix and product lines uh very
5:08:16
important for a product manager you know at least for his organization and for his competitor you know close competitor
5:08:21
organization he should have good understanding about what is the product mix so what is product mix so product
5:08:27
mix basically definition talks about it refers to complete range of products that company offers to its customer it
5:08:34
represents total variety of products that business sells and it can be classified in terms of of uh you know
5:08:40
width of a product mix length of a product mix depth of a product mix and the consist consistency in the product
5:08:46
mix so product mix overall products what you are selling to the End customer and
5:08:51
this product mix can be categorized or can be represented by width length depth and overall consistency so let's try to
5:08:58
understand what what does each mean so width refers to number of different product lines a company offers wider the
5:09:06
product mix it means that company has multiple product lines so just to give an example just if you take an in know
5:09:12
case of apple as an organization and if you take what kind of product lines they have so there is one product line for
5:09:19
iPhones there is another product line for MacBook there is another product line for iPad and I think recently they
5:09:26
started another product line for variables so these are called as a this
5:09:32
is called as a width number of different product lines so for Apple in this case we have the width number is four because
5:09:39
they have four product lines these are independent product lines so this is about width second concept length of a
5:09:46
product line so basically refers to the total number of products or items within
5:09:51
a within you know one particular product line so length for iPhone length for
5:09:56
MacBook length for iPad length for variables that's it that's how it is so if you take an example of uh iPhone as
5:10:03
an product line the company has multiple models within iPhone you know you have iPhone SE 14 14 pro 15 15 Pro so how
5:10:11
many products are there within that product line is basically it talks about overall it represent the length of a
5:10:18
product line and the last which is depth depth refers to number of variants each
5:10:24
product of each product in that product line for example you know you can have iPhone 14 in 64 GB you can have it in
5:10:32
128 GB you can have it in 256 GB you can have it in different different colors
5:10:38
sizes models so depth refers to number of variations of each product in a product line
5:10:45
different size colors models each iPhone model has different storage options you know 64 128 256 as we discussed plus
5:10:53
there will be there could be a variation in the color so that's what it represent the depth and at the end basically
5:11:01
consistency so consistency refers to how closely related the various product
5:11:06
lines are in terms of product ction distribution and usage for example Apple's product iPhone iPad MacBook are
5:11:14
highly consistent because they all operate in similar software you know they they all are on iOS as operating
5:11:20
system and are designed for similar customer base so how much what is the level of commonization they have how
5:11:28
much consistency is there so how how what is the commonality they have that represents the
5:11:33
consistency so product mix width number of product lines length number of
5:11:40
products in the product line depth number of variants for each product in a
5:11:46
product line consistency what's the commonality between different different
5:11:51
products within that product mix so let's take another case of Nike so width
5:11:56
Nike has a multiple product lines you know they have Footwear as a product line they have appil and Equipment
5:12:04
length within Footwear you know they offer um sneaker running shoes
5:12:10
basketball shoes walking shoes soccer shoes so that's the length depth nikq
5:12:16
offers various colors and sizes for each sneakers model such as Air Max in
5:12:22
different styles and colors So within sneakers they have different different variety it could be design it could be
5:12:27
color consistency all products are related to sports and active lifestyle
5:12:33
maintaining consistency across product line because they basically mostly Nike is note for sports related uh area so
5:12:40
that's the commonality that's the consistency as per your understanding this width number length number depth
5:12:46
number ideally it should be high or it should be low and if no questions are there typically what should be the value
5:12:53
for width length and depth should be high or it should be low length and width good to be high and depth good to
5:13:00
be low okay you should not overdesign the product you know it should not last for 10 years 15 years you should look at
5:13:06
what is the customer expectation if customer expectation is 2 to 3 years that's how you know you should design
5:13:12
your product if you are designing it for 5 to 10 years five designing a product which will last for more than 5 years
5:13:17
that means there is a lot of uh opportunity for cost reduction for your
5:13:23
produ product which you have not done it and uh I I personally feel you know if
5:13:28
that's the situation shoes nobody would like to use the shoes which is five years old because design is very very
5:13:33
old and but still they are in a good shape and condition looks like it is these are or design at that time they
5:13:40
could have done some cost optimization they could have reduced the cost they could have kept the price constant and
5:13:45
they could have basically increased the overall margin for the company Point number one so that is the first
5:13:51
opportunity they have lost and first and second one is in three years three to four years to go back and they have to
5:13:56
buy another shoe I think that was also opportunity lost for Nike even if it lost for three years still it will give
5:14:02
good U review because that's the expectation for a retail buyer okay whether it these are like a retail
5:14:09
consumer products or they are electronic products or what kind of products are they plus you know when it comes to
5:14:15
width defining how many product lines your company should have it Sol depends upon what kind of brand value you have
5:14:22
for example if you are new guy into the in that industry you do not want to have
5:14:27
multiple product lines because you are here you are somebody like um newcomer into the industry you would like to have
5:14:33
limited product lines you would like to focus on so that you can have a better focus on those product lines those product products and you would like to
5:14:40
create impression create identity for yourself in that industry so width is
5:14:45
totally depends upon you know what kind of maturity you have in that industry if you are new or if you are fairly new I
5:14:53
typically width number is very very low and if the organization is very well established you can see the width number
5:14:59
is very very high talking about length and depth it totally depends upon you know uh the industry the product and the
5:15:06
End customer so that's how basically length and depth defined but I have I can give you one more example uh let's
5:15:13
take example of uh tataa Motors when I joined the tataa motor tat Motors basically yeah it was very much
5:15:19
established organization and I'm talking about product basically the engine variations don't take it as overall
5:15:25
vehicle variations engine variations So within petrol how many variants they have so since it was very much
5:15:30
established company so product lines they they were multiple types of you
5:15:35
know petrol VAR petrol products petrol engines were there but when it comes to a length you know they had so many
5:15:42
variants so because of which the inventory management operation management it was very very difficult
5:15:48
because they had to maintain 75 variants of engines and it has created a huge
5:15:53
inventory cost operation management cost most of the variants does not have you
5:15:58
know good sales still they were you know keeping them active so they have to ensure that the spare spots are
5:16:03
available across all customer Supports and all so if you have the the length
5:16:09
and depth numbers are very very high it it becomes very very difficult for customer service perspective so
5:16:16
periodically each organization they will do the review for what kind of length is
5:16:22
there what kind of depth is there and annually they will check it and if the kind of one particular variant does not
5:16:29
have a good demand typically they they they go you they go to again that product life cycle management and they
5:16:35
will take a decision to kill that particular variant either it in l or it in depth so that's how they will do it
5:16:41
because having a too many variants in length and depth will create a big problem for operations management but
5:16:47
width is totally depends upon uh you know what kind of maturity you have in that industry so that that's my
5:16:54
perspective okay good let's go to next slide then okay weo says uh how it works
5:17:01
for SAS software as a sales product again it the concept will remain same you know how many variants of SAS
5:17:09
products are there with you let me I think how many variants of SAS products
5:17:14
are there I know what kind of uh so length in in that case you know you have single software and you are selling it
5:17:20
as a service however you know but it it can have different pricing models you know one it could be using uh paper
5:17:29
sorry paper price one you can one for one you can have um kind of bundle pricing model so concept remains same
5:17:37
whether it is a product based company or service based company so overall it talks about what kind of variations are
5:17:42
there which you are providing from yourself to the target market and all
5:17:47
those variants which you have to manage are optimal or not if they are not optimal please check it and you can
5:17:54
retire couple of variants so that's the concept it is applicable to service industry as well W let's go to product
5:18:01
line uh let's try to go one level deeper product line so product line as we understood refers to group of related
5:18:07
products that are marketed under single brand so keyword here is single brand and are designed to serve a specific
5:18:13
segment or meet a particular need all products within the product line typically have similar functionality and
5:18:19
are marketed to the same customer base share distribution channel so for
5:18:26
example uh if you go for product uh line it could be Apple iPhone as a category
5:18:33
iPhone basically they have single Brand Apple iPhone they are designed to
5:18:39
specific segment so you have you know Target customer for Apple mobiles so
5:18:46
customer segment remains same for all the products within the product line and they basically they meet a particular
5:18:52
need yes basically brand communication device branded communication device that's the need all products within the
5:18:59
product line typically have similar functionality so Apple 13 to 14 14 to 15
5:19:04
most of the features will remain same 15 might have some additional 10% feature then 14 14 might have 10 to 20% feature
5:19:12
additional but more or less you will see 80% features are same and marketed to
5:19:17
the same customer base yes customer base are same and share same distribution channels so distribution inventory and
5:19:23
all those things will remain same so that's the definition of product line keywords for product line definition are
5:19:29
they have a single brand they serve specific segment and they have similar
5:19:35
functionality marketed to the same customer base and share distribution channels key characteristics of a
5:19:41
product line so as we discussed uh related products products in product line typically share similar features or
5:19:47
are designed for same purpose for example Coca-Cola offers product line of a beverage that includes coke diet coke
5:19:55
Coke Zero flowed Coke related products targeting the same customer product in the product line often uh often aimed at
5:20:03
the same or similar customer segments for example if you take Microsoft Office so product line in includes um word
5:20:10
excel PowerPoint and now if you go for the latest generation product which is co-pilot all are designed for business
5:20:15
purpose corporate users next one is sold under common brand name products within the product line are usually marked
5:20:22
under you know under consistent brand identity example L'Oreal has skincare products that includes moisturizer
5:20:29
cleaners sunscreen but uh if you look at what brand so everybody you know shares the
5:20:36
same brand which is L'Oreal example of product line Tesla for example product line Tesla's electric vehicle
5:20:41
constitutes uh constitute product line so product in the line they have Model S model 3 X Y all are focusing on
5:20:49
sustainable energy premium automotive design electric vehicle and shared features each model shared similar
5:20:54
features such as electric powert train autonomous driving focus on sustainability so and and so forth this
5:21:00
is you know details about product line I hope you guys are clear with the product line definition and uh product mix plus
5:21:07
product line so let's a top level differentiation so product mix is the entire collection of a product uh
5:21:13
product line is specific group of related products under one brand a scope you know it includes all the product
5:21:20
lines and their variations so product mix means anything and everything in your for your whatever your organization Sals but product line is no basically it
5:21:27
includes only one category of products uh width I think uh same question what
5:21:32
George was asking uh it represents how many product lines are there in the company and the product line it
5:21:38
represent number of related products in this specific category so number of product lines defines the width and
5:21:43
product line is basically um within that product line number of related products
5:21:49
the focus for product mix entire company's product offering and product line focus is focuses on the products
5:21:56
that have similar customer needs example we discussed Nike product mix includes footwear apperal equipment Nike product
5:22:04
line running shoes so one of them is here which is running shoes includes multiple models
5:22:09
Zoom Pegasus now the question is why product mix and product lines are important for business Market coverage a
5:22:16
diverse mix allows companies to Target different customer segments and expand their Market presence you know overall
5:22:23
Market coverage risk management by having multiple product lines companies can reduce the dependency on one
5:22:30
product and SP risk you know if one product fails you have multiple products
5:22:37
so basically having multi products it will reduce the risk brand extension companies can leverage their Brand's
5:22:43
reputation across product lines to launch new products this is what business will get by having multiple
5:22:49
products or you know in general having product mix for customers you know you should you will have I think a brand mix
5:22:56
gives the customer more choices across different categories you know I have multiple variants uh specialization
5:23:03
product lines offer specialized product that c specific needs or preferences making it easier for customer customers
5:23:09
to find the right product in fact you know let's take example of Samsung phone
5:23:15
you know they have category like uh I don't know how many you how many of you follow the Samsung phones there is a
5:23:21
series which is specifically available in um Samsung stores they have again I
5:23:26
think uh M series specifically available in I think Amazon they have app series
5:23:34
specifically available on flip cart but product specific if you see 95% product
5:23:40
specifications are same but if you see the product pricing there is a is always
5:23:46
costlier than M and M and F are similar so if you closely look at Samsung
5:23:52
portfolio you will see there is a lot of overlap there is small differences but for that small differences also they
5:23:58
created a separate uh you know series and accordingly they are positioning it
5:24:03
so if I want to buy from uh Samsung stores I need to go for
5:24:08
a similar product I can get it from Amazon also I can get it in much more cheaper rate uh but it is online and you
5:24:17
know when you ask Samsung retail guy customer service okay what's the difference between a and m then they say
5:24:23
that uh uh a is little bit better in performance but not much better you know
5:24:29
but still they ask for plus almost 3 to 4,000 premium for a series rather than M
5:24:35
Series so for customer you know if you looking for more reliable you will go for a series if you are okay with uh
5:24:42
little bit compromise on performance you'll go for M Series so that's what you know for customer having a different
5:24:48
product lines different product CH variants will give you different choices
5:24:53
and accordingly they are targeting your end customer I think here we have example of PNG Proctor and Campell
5:25:00
offers wide mix wide mix wild product mix including Beauty Healthcare cleaning products each product lines for example
5:25:07
Tide laundry detergent Head and Shoulder shampoo SES distinct uh customer needs but
5:25:13
collectively broaden PNG Market Rich so they have multiple products PNG similar
5:25:19
example is HL they have multiple product lines and within that product lines they they compete with each other basically
5:25:25
PNG versus hql so that's that's basically defines why why you have to have product mix and product lines
5:25:32
different different product lines because from business side you can able to manage the risk you can able to
5:25:38
select um separate Target customer and from customer side you you you will get a right product for your requirement
5:25:46
that's why it is important so as a concept okay we have understood but what is in it what uh what is what it meant
5:25:54
for product managers so once you are a product manager you should know what is the product mix for your product what is
5:26:02
you know your product falls under which product line you should have a very good understanding about uh
5:26:08
what is the width for your organization what is the length for your organization what is the depth for your
5:26:14
organization which product you are managing and you should have similar exam similar information for your
5:26:19
competitor as well so which is your core competitor which are your adjacent competitors so that's where you are
5:26:26
going to use this Concepts the organization you know you you can take your organization as an example and uh a
5:26:34
broad example about what kind of uh product lines they have and you can take any one product line how many variants
5:26:41
are there and what is the depth anybody would like to explain worth trying don't
5:26:47
worry you can talk let's go to the next concept now let's try to understand uh
5:26:54
number five which is the product line extension and modification a subconcept of product mix and product lines what is
5:27:01
the meaning of product line extension so product line extension refers to addition of a new product to existing
5:27:07
product line uh uh the new products are typically variants of the existing one
5:27:12
but offer different features like a style or different uh you know target market this strategy is used to leverage
5:27:19
brand security and customer loyalty to expand expand the company's presence into the market without the need for
5:27:25
launching entirely new product so basically extension means you have set of products iPhone 13 14 15 is there and
5:27:33
now you would like to extend it by iPhone 16 so everything is a available you are Crea additional product line
Product Line Extension and Modification
5:27:41
so types of product line extension new variants offering a product in different flavors color size design a new feature
5:27:49
you can think of adding or enhancing features to differentiate the product from existing ones are targeting new
5:27:55
segment and introducing product that CS to new customer segments or demography a premium versus budget version all those
5:28:02
things so it is called as a product line extension examples Coca-Cola existing
5:28:08
uh extending its product line by offering variants like a Diet Coke Coke Zero uh Coke Cherry these variants
5:28:15
Target customers who wants low calories option or different flavors while maintaining the core identity of
5:28:21
Coca-Cola so existing will everything will remain same you are trying to sell the product with Coca-Cola brand but you
5:28:27
are creating a specific variant to Target specific customers so in this
5:28:33
case diet Koda if you take an example they were targeting those customers who are worried about calorie intake so they
5:28:39
created a diet cook and they created a new segment and accordingly they captured that market if you take example
5:28:45
of apples iPhone line Apple often extends its iPhone line with new models
5:28:51
such as you know iPhone Pro 134 which differ in terms of feature price points performance levels but CER different
5:28:57
customer needs within the same product line so product line extension addition of product into your product line to CER
5:29:04
uh specific need for a customer and to extend your uh end customers this is called as a product line extension let's
5:29:10
try to understand product modification so there is lot of overlap but again modification terminology is basically
5:29:17
referring to the changes typically they do it for mostly for improvements made for existing products in the product
5:29:23
line these modifications can be driven by you know it could be technological advancement customer feedback Market
5:29:28
competition a regular requirement product modifications are aimed at keeping the product relevant improving
5:29:34
the performance or aligning with market trends without launching ENT entirely new product so here also you do
5:29:40
modifications on your product but the intention is not to Target for new
5:29:45
customer here you are targeting existing customer but you are trying to give them the enhanced service it could be
5:29:51
software book fix or it could be uh improved performance like that so
5:29:57
modifications due to customer complaint yeah correct modification due to in customer complaints uh it could be
5:30:03
improving the products durability performance reliability a car manufacturer upgrading gen or safety
5:30:08
features of existing models to improve its performance functional modification enhancing an additional new
5:30:14
functionality to product to improve its us usefulness or convenience a smartphone manufacturer adding new
5:30:21
camera feature increasing battery life this basically kind of overlaps a lot
5:30:26
with product line extension if you see functional modifications wherein uh the existing functions are kind of less you
5:30:33
thought of adding new features new functions and so you added that as an
5:30:39
new variant in your product line new product in your product line so that also can fall under product line
5:30:45
extension category but the first one quality modifications wherein you don't want to continue the product you know
5:30:51
production of older product B and basically you are stopping the production of older product and you are
5:30:56
enhancing the performance and then accordingly you are positioning it so that that falls under product
5:31:01
modification category it could be style or aesthetic modification changing the appearance design packaging uh Fe
5:31:07
feature upgradation again it falls under feature functional modification category but essentially modification talks for
5:31:14
uh there are issues you enhance it you stop the previous version then you modify it and extension means okay you
5:31:21
don't stop the current variant you will add another category into the product line and but the production for both the
5:31:27
variants will happen parall that's how it is so is this clear product line extension modification extension means
5:31:34
adding a new product in your product line modification is uh modifying it because of customer complaint or some
5:31:40
quality issues why what are the benefits product line extensions what benefits you are going to get as we discussed you
5:31:46
know Market segmentation allowing companies to Target U different customer group or niche market with variations
5:31:53
that meet the specific needs or preferences so you're creating a new market segmentation brand loyalty
5:31:59
customer who are loyal to your brand are more likely to try to new products within the same line reducing marketing
5:32:05
cost so you know extension you don't have to do extra you know marketing campaigning because most of the time
5:32:11
existing customers will go for new product what you are launching in product line extension so you have you are leveraging your existing brand brand
5:32:19
value and you are leveraging existing brand brand loyalty increased market
5:32:24
share by doing all those things you are at the end of the day you are increasing your market share and you are increasing your competitive Advantage because uh
5:32:32
extension allow companies to stay competitive by introducing new options and staying relevant into the market
5:32:38
additional thing what he has not been written here is you know risk mitigation so if you see think that uh there is a
5:32:44
lot of competition for your existing product you have created a new product variant to Target for particular Niche
5:32:51
customer segment accordingly you are reducing the dependency for your current generation of product because there is a
5:32:56
lot of competition even though over a period of time your current generation product doesn't do well since your you
5:33:02
created a new variant targeted for certain segment of a customer for which you have very less competi because of
5:33:08
doing all those things you are reducing the risk product modifications yeah I think as we discussed am also mentioned
5:33:15
uh that about uh customer satisfaction you know you have too many complaints you modify your existing product
5:33:20
modifying the product based on customer feedback helps address pain points enhance customer user experience uh stay
5:33:26
current you know modification keep your products up to date with industry standards technological advancement and
5:33:32
at the end you are going to get customer have basically good customer feedback cost effective innovation modifications
5:33:38
allows companies to refresh existing product without the cost and risk launching entirely new product products
5:33:44
so cost effective Innovations without cost and risk of launching entirely new products so it's very very cost
5:33:51
effective and compliance and safety in some cases product modifications are necessary to meet the new safety
5:33:56
regulations environmental standards so accordingly you create a product modification and modified product you would like to launch it to a new market
5:34:03
examples of product line extension and modifications so let's let's go back to toyoto H brid line extension toyoto
5:34:09
extended its product line from with Prius they expand then expanded it to further variants like Prius C compact
5:34:17
prsv larger vagant Prius Prime plug-in hybrid this allowed toy Toyo to Target
5:34:23
different customer needs with a eco-friendly vehicle segment so like that they created extension for CV and
5:34:29
Prime which are targeted for compact customer large vagon customer and plugin hybrid customer product line
5:34:35
modification Apple camera modification could be a good example with each iteration of the iPhone Apple modifies
5:34:42
modifies the camera system improving the you know they go for higher resolution
5:34:47
they go for you know additional features like a night mode enhancing image stabilization this modification keep
5:34:53
iPhone competitive in the smartphone industry smartphone market while appealing to the customer who prioritize
5:35:00
photography so that's the example of uh modification modification extension I
5:35:05
think straightforward concept here okay let's go to next slide strategic decisions on product line so for example
5:35:12
let's take a case wherein you are the product line product manager so you are handling whole product man product line
5:35:18
and you are product manager for that line so just to go back to moj's
5:35:24
question you know let's take example product line the products what you are managing are fairly complex so typically
5:35:31
typical designation for product line product manager is the director level so you are director of product manager you
5:35:37
hand a big product line and what are the decisions you need to make at that level
5:35:42
on that product line so that's what we will try to understand in number six okay so the first decision is product
5:35:49
line length decision so this involves determining how many individual products
Strategic Decisions on Product Line
5:35:54
or sqs should be included in the product line a product line can be extended or
5:36:00
shortened depends upon company's goal and Market condition so you will decide only how many products are there in your
5:36:07
product line do you need to modify do do you need to extend them do you need to reduce them if at all you want
5:36:14
to add a new product so it is called as line stretching
5:36:20
okay New Concept so companies can stretch the line in three ways for
5:36:26
example the first way is called as a upward stretch so introducing higher end premium product to CER more uh affluent
5:36:34
customer base uh you are going to introduce a premium product into the existing product line it is called as
5:36:40
upward stretch so toyoto stretching its product line upward with the introduction of luxury brand like Lexus
5:36:47
so Lexus was kind of a upward stretch for the product line they created
5:36:52
overall new product line for Lexus which scattered to premium products so it was
5:36:57
like upward stretch of line second one is downward stretch of line where in you are introducing a lower pric product to
5:37:04
attract more budget uh conscious customers Samsung offering budget mobiles like Galaxy a Ser in addition to
5:37:12
its premium Galaxy S Series S series is premium a series is budget customers so
5:37:17
you are basically stretching the product line downward and two way you are expanding it in both way so Marriot
5:37:24
Hotel if you take an example they offer budget friendly option uh Fair field in as well as
5:37:31
luxury options RS Calon to capture both ends of Market
5:37:38
okay so you can expand the existing product line upward you can expand the product line downward you can expand
5:37:44
your product line both the ways or you can do line filling so this involves uh
5:37:49
adding more products within the existing range of the product line to fill the gaps or satisfy specific customer needs
5:37:57
that are not yet addressed for example Coca-Cola adding a different flavor of diet Cod diet Cod climb diet clo Cherry
5:38:06
to fill the gaps in customer preferences for flavored uh low calorie drinks so it
5:38:12
is called as a line filling so you can have line goes upward you can have line goes downward you can have line goes
5:38:19
both upward and downward or you can have you know same line but you are going to fill in the gaps which earlier the
5:38:26
product was not available so I think example they have given is COA Cocola so
5:38:32
Diet Coke was available but you know they thought that okay let's uh make
5:38:37
some more variants let's increase the depth so let's go for Diet Coke lime Diet Coke cherry and accordingly they
5:38:43
created a separate product in fact I can give one more example of automotive industry so before 2020 you had uh
5:38:52
hatchback you know like uh Hundai it 10 Swift or you have sadan uh like Swift
5:39:00
desire or you had tat Manza these kind of vehicles and after
5:39:05
that you had utility vehicle which where uh like uh tatas sumo's Grande and all
5:39:11
these mahindra's product portfolio however Tata came up with a new segment called as a CUV it is called as a
5:39:18
compact utility vehicle so if you look at uh tat Nexon it is the I think it was
5:39:24
the first CUV vehicle compact utility vehicle which was again I think uh uh
5:39:31
similar products where Ford uh Ford had one vehicle in that category
5:39:37
so essentially what I would like to tell you that they do it across multiple Industries so they look for you know is
5:39:43
your products are captured uh is there any room for filling the Gap
5:39:51
in your existing product portfolio if yes it is called as a line
5:39:56
filling we have one comment called from George Inda is the Inda is the first one in hatchback but I was talking about CUV
5:40:03
category compact utility vehicle so Tata next one that was first vehicle in that
5:40:08
category because earlier we had uh overall utility vehicle but you never
5:40:13
had CUV kind of category so CUV uh next one was the first vehicle so
5:40:20
it was like a line filling you bring one product in between this uh two product
5:40:25
two products it is called as line filling and you know why this terminologies is it looks very simple
5:40:32
but they expect you to use this terminology these are key terms they use it in product man M agement world so
5:40:38
when you talk to another product manager when you talk to your product line head you're supposed to use this terminology
5:40:43
sir can we think of uper stretch sir can we think of dward stretch so these these words are expected because these are
5:40:50
commonly used verbage in product management uh day-to-day activity so that's where these words are important
5:40:57
line filling so it is basically a product line manager you know who is
5:41:03
responsible for whole product line it is his responsibility to look for what are the different products are there in that
5:41:08
product line is there any possibility is there any you know Market to Upward
5:41:13
stretch that product line is there any you know opportunities to downward stretch it do I need to two-way stretch
5:41:20
it or do I need to go for line filling so overall responsibility is product line manager and as I told uh typical
5:41:28
this lies with uh director of product management is a typical designation for product line manager so he works closely
5:41:35
with uh marketing team he will check what kind of customer demands are there how many demands we are meeting how many
5:41:42
demands we are not meeting and he will also have a close eye on what competitors does and accordingly he will
5:41:48
decide whether you need to create a new segment in your product line or you are happy with your existing segments next
5:41:55
point is product line differentiation so you are the product line owner you have to differentiating product within the
5:42:02
product line helps ensure that each products appeals to distinguish uh
5:42:07
segment oh sorry appeals to distinct segment of the market or address different needs without causing customer
5:42:14
confusion so you as a product manager you have to ensure that each product in your product line has its own um space
5:42:22
and there is no kind of overlap you know what we understood I think just before some time you are not cannibalizing the
5:42:29
product within the product line it's product lines man product line product manager responsibility to ensure that
5:42:36
you have separate products which are cing to a different customer base or different customer demands and no
5:42:42
products are cannibalizing others strategic consideration targeting different customer segments so
5:42:48
differentiating products by features quality price to C to various customer segments example Apple differentiates
5:42:55
its uh MacBook line by MacBook Air targeting General users and MacBook Pro
5:43:01
targeting professionals and power users so if you are a product line manager for MacBook you have two products MacBook
5:43:08
Air and MacBook Pro so here you have to ensure that uh each product CS to different uh end customers so a is
5:43:15
targeting for General users Pro is targeting for power users Innovative features introducing new features or
5:43:21
Technologies to differentiate the products so you have to ensure that as a product line manager each product has Innovative features which can
5:43:28
differentiate itself not only among that products which are in the product line
5:43:33
but also with competitor products also example samel differ Sam differentiates it Galaxy smartphone by offering
5:43:40
foldable phones so Galaxy Zed fold Z flip alongside standard models so I
5:43:47
think flip is the flip feature is a differentiating feature so that's how they are positioning it brand
5:43:53
positioning using product differentiation to reinforce the brand positioning Premium versus Mass Market
5:44:00
uh Rolex differentiates its luxury watches with unique design exclusive
5:44:05
material and high crafts ship reinforcing its premium positioning so
5:44:10
brand positioning so typically these are the ways why you by doing that one you ensure that there is a product line has
5:44:17
a differentiation product line differentiation product line stretching decisions so as a product line product
5:44:23
manager you will do these two decisions okay let's go to next page product line extension decisions it is like overlap
5:44:30
of this one number one so they call it as companies often face strategic
5:44:35
decisions regarding extending the product lines to enter New Market or address unmute needs horizontal product
5:44:41
line extension introducing new product at the same price point to c to different test Styles or preferences
5:44:47
without significantly altering the core product so L'Oreal extending its skin care line with products that c to
5:44:53
different skin types you know you can have one product for sensitive one product for highly infect they launched
5:45:01
fair and lovely for oily skin similarly L'Oreal also has the same product which are targeting for different skin types
5:45:08
accordingly you can have horizontal product line extension or you can have vertical product line extension
5:45:14
introducing new product at different price point either more affordable which
5:45:19
is downward what we have understood in the last slide or upward which is more premium to Target to different income
5:45:25
groups so vertical product line extension you know upward downward what we understood horizontal is more
5:45:30
interesting here so you have same price but you can have different uh
5:45:36
customizable option I would say so that's how you can position your products cannibalization risk I think
5:45:42
that's what we understood when existing product line a key strategic decision involves managing the risk of
5:45:48
cannibalization where the new products may take sales away from existing product uh instead of attracting new
5:45:55
customers when Apple introduced iPhone SC as a more affordable option it risk
5:46:00
canalized sales from more expensive iPhone models so cannibalization risk is there so this risk are Ty typically you
5:46:08
are trying to do the cannibalization risk at product line product management level so it is his responsibility to
5:46:14
ensure that uh it is not cannibalized yeah fourth one is product line modernization so product line needs
5:46:21
continuous updating and improvements to say to stay relevant to stay competitive into the market and keep the pace with
5:46:28
the technological advancement changing consumer preference and Regulatory changes what are the key decisions
5:46:35
upgrading existing products modernizing the products it could be material design to keep keep them relevant you
5:46:42
know Tesla regular upgrades its electric vehicle softwares and um add new autonomous driving features to keep
5:46:48
product line modern and Cutting Edge in fact not only Tesla each company they
5:46:54
you know yearly they they go for model year so 20206 model 2017 model and 16
5:47:01
model will be phased out when they start production of 2017 and they 17 will be advanced version of 16 so they keep on
5:47:08
upgrading the existing products so that uh you are addressing the customer complaints for existing models and also
5:47:15
you are keeping relevant you are keeping those products relevant in the market by going for the latest trends and latest
5:47:21
Technologies uh phasing of the old model that's what I told as a product line modernization companies most
5:47:26
strategically decide when to phase out outdated products Microsoft disting discontinued support for older variants
5:47:33
for Windows to focus on new versions like a 10 and 11 so if you look at that uh Microsoft no more provides the
5:47:39
support for seven Microsoft 7even applications now because they already moved to 10 and 11 in fact they are
5:47:45
looking for stopping the support for Windows 10 also they're totally focusing on 11 and above investing in
5:47:52
sustainability many companies are modernizing the product Lines by incorporating more sustainable features
5:47:57
you know uh designs materials and production process uh pentagonia incorporate
5:48:04
sustainable materials in clothing lines and continuously upgrades products to reduce environmental impact but I think
5:48:10
they do lot of it could be sustainability reason it could be a customer complaints reason it could be making the product more uh uh you know
5:48:19
efficient or more relevant to the new newest Technologies go for software bugs
5:48:24
so these are the different uh I would say trigger points to keep your product line modernization so typically once in
5:48:32
a six months every product line manager they will have thorough review on all the products I would say quarterly you
5:48:39
know wherein they will check what kind of how many customer complaints are you are getting on that product uh do we
5:48:45
have opportunities for improvement performance do you have cost reduction opportunities I think the last point
5:48:51
every organization is working on sustainability so every product manager will have sustainability goals in his
5:48:57
annual operating you know goal settings every year goals how what are you doing from sustainability perspective so he
5:49:04
will look at sustainability making the product more sustainable from that uh from that perspective also opportunities
5:49:11
to make products more sustainable and accordingly they are upgrading the existing product portfolio so these
5:49:17
decisions lie with product line product manager so strategic decisions for product line another one how to keep
5:49:22
product line modernized and relevant yeah uh number five product line
5:49:28
profitability analysis again you know they check what kind of revenues you are making so not every product in product
5:49:34
line contributes to equal contribute equally to profitability you know some products might make uh you know X
5:49:42
Revenue other products might make y revenue and but based on that strategic decision must be made about which
5:49:49
products to promote which products to discontinue or modify based on the contribution to the bottom line do you
5:49:56
know I was not knowing before couple of years when I did you know my masters
5:50:02
then I came to know but then I realized okay people do talk about it very frequently and I was not knowing what is Top Line what is bottom line so Top Line
5:50:09
is uh so these lines depicts your uh profit and loss financial statement or
5:50:17
overall revenue for example if you're product manager Top Line defines overall revenue generated by your product what
5:50:22
is the bottom line for your product again it's a financial term Amal says by subtracting expenses and operating cost
5:50:28
and interest what but what does that profit called as yes yeah it is called as a net profit so bottom line talks
5:50:35
about net profit so if you look if you read this line every product in the
5:50:41
product line contributes equally to profitability strategic decisions must be made about which products to promote
5:50:48
which products to discontinue or modify based on their contribution to bottom line so product line manager okay
5:50:55
revenue is important but what is more important for the organization net profit net profit is more important than
5:51:02
Top Line because you know if you look at you know if you if it is uh retail product your uh it again depends upon
5:51:09
the size and scale of the product but how much revenue companies making that
5:51:15
is important but it is more important is how much is your profit because profit will Define the growth for your
5:51:21
organization net profits so as a product manager you will be more worried about bottom line than Top Line but
5:51:27
essentially as I told once in a quarter you will review all your products not only from you know what we discussed
5:51:33
about um not only about sustainability and you know the customer complaints and all those things but also you are doing
5:51:39
it from uh Revenue perspective and accordingly you will make decisions what are the decisions you will make it
5:51:44
product life cycle evaluating which product sits in life cycle which product sits in which life cycle stage so
5:51:50
introduction growth maturity deine so typically even though product manager will Define it but product line manager
5:51:58
will have overall understanding about each products in that product line whether the product is in growth or
5:52:03
whether that particular product is in maturity and according ly he will do the review and he will decide whether to
5:52:09
invest it or whether to phase it out example the classic iPod once a flagship product was discontinued by Apple after
5:52:17
uh you know iPhone over to ks market so iPod you know I know at that time around
5:52:23
20078 I would say it was very famous product iPod iPod iPod but once they launch iPhone they discontinued iPod
5:52:30
cost benefit analysis analyzing the cost of maintaining and marketing a product
5:52:36
versus Revenue it generates it's called as a cost benefit analysis example a
5:52:41
company might discontinue a product that has low sales volume but requires High marketing cost but essentially your
5:52:48
volume is also low top line is low marketing costs are high net profits will be eventually low because revenue
5:52:54
is low and costs are high so you might decide to discontinue it so all those
5:52:59
decisions you know about the product line profitability analysis and making the decisions on a product line that is
5:53:06
the responsibility of product line product managers okay last one product line
5:53:12
consistency a product line consistency refers to how closely related the products within the line in terms of use
5:53:18
production distribution strategic decisions involving invol determining whether to maintain or expand the
5:53:26
consistency now let's go back I'll ask one question why consistency is
5:53:32
important why product line manager should ensure that there is a consistency in the products please don't
5:53:39
read the next lines I think I would like you to spontaneously think and talk about it so you are using reusability
5:53:46
for your application but in general having a consistency will reduce your operation cost your you know
5:53:52
distribution cost all the things you know if there is a lot of consistency commonality between different products
5:53:58
within one product line you can reuse many things across multiple things so
5:54:03
overall you know economies of scale uh another concept so maybe I can take it
5:54:09
later I think too many Concept today so reusability you should be able to so you'll have you have to handle less
5:54:15
inventory you have you don't have to train a new you know uh you don't have
5:54:20
to train your Salesforce if there is a lot of consistency so your distribution coaching sales everything infrastructure
5:54:28
will remain same so that's what defines the consistency so consistency will Define your operations and marketing
5:54:34
cost and again if you are increasing your top line if you are because of consistency you are
5:54:40
not increasing your operations cost to a wider range because there is a lot of consistency at then what you are going
5:54:47
to get you are going to get more bottom line you are going to get more net profit that's the intention that's why
5:54:54
one of the Strategic decision for a product line manager is to maintain the good product line consistency so
5:55:00
strategic consistency highly consistent product line product that are closely related to its function Market segment
5:55:05
production process so for example C offers consistent product line of oral hygiene products toothpaste mouthwash
5:55:13
toothbrushes that Target specific customer need expanding into new categories sometimes companies decide to
5:55:20
diversify their product line to capture new markets leading to a lower consistency example Amazon originally
5:55:26
online bookstore expanded product line into Electronics apparel cloud computing
5:55:31
groceries creating a less consistency but uh you know this case you know they we originally we only for bookstores
5:55:38
they expanded into Electronics nowhere related to bookstore apparel totally
5:55:44
different cloud computing totally different groceries totally different so consistency is very very low if you look
5:55:50
at this products but there is a diverse product mix as long as they can able to maintain a good profitability it's
5:55:58
okay but uh having a consistent product good consistency will definitely reduce
5:56:04
the operations cost so for Amazon I think there was a different need because at that time there was no e-commerce
5:56:10
player for electronics so they have a separate market so they decided that even though I might increase my
5:56:17
operations cost but this area was not been touched by anybody else and I can go for additional profits since nobody's
5:56:24
there in the competition so even though my operations costs are high I'll still go for electronics as a target market so
5:56:30
that was a different story but the consistency wise that decision was on a lower scale there was was very low
5:56:37
consistency okay guys so what we understood we understood uh what are the key decisions product manager will make
5:56:43
product line manager will make decisions about length decisions about differentiation decisions about
5:56:49
extension in horizontal vertical cannibalization risk why know
5:56:54
modernization profitability related decision based on that you will decide which phase of the product line shall I
5:57:01
move it to next phase in the product life cycle phase and what kind of
5:57:06
consistency I have do I need to improve my performance from consistency perspective so since it is very Niche
5:57:13
and I'll take a case wherein you have a monopoly Market Monopoly or oligopoly market so definition of monopoly so
5:57:20
monopoly definition is you are the only one in the market who is supplying who is supplying the products or service to
5:57:27
that market it is called as a monopoly oligopoly means you have one or two
5:57:32
competitors but mostly it is handled by all the industries handled by two or
5:57:38
three players so and the third one category is perfect competition so these are you know I think uh if you go to MBA
5:57:46
microecon microeconomics 101 so they call I'll just type this words Monopoly first one
5:57:54
hopo second one perfect competition so these are the different types of
5:58:00
Industries your industry either be Monopoly or it oligopoly or it is a perfect competition so Monopoly you are
5:58:07
the only one oligopoly whole industry is handled by couple of players and perfect
5:58:12
competition means there are n number of players for example uh perfect competition I can take apparel industry
5:58:18
you have lots of players available into the industry so that is perfect competition so if you see the gross
5:58:24
margin you know the bottom line bottom line will be always highest for Monopoly
5:58:29
in oligopoly it will be better but not as high as Monopoly in perfect competition
5:58:36
it is the least you know typical gross margin percentage for perfect competition industry is not even uh 10
5:58:43
percentage or 20% but that you know if you go for Monopoly industry players will make more than 100
5:58:50
percentage profit so if the overall cost for a product is 100 rupees the selling price will be more than 200 so that kind
5:58:56
of profits they will enjoy so now let's go back to the amal's question it's a
5:59:01
very niche market you know I would consider it as either Monopoly or ol and the question is since it is very
5:59:09
niche market uh how can I you know uh go for line stretching horizontal what are
5:59:17
those thing horizontal extension vertical extension and all those decisions how can I make it so my uh you
5:59:24
know the feedback to amol's question is first of all I think he should try to understand is there a need for extension
5:59:32
so all those decisions you will make based on if there is a need so you will will work closely with marketing team
5:59:38
you will try to understand what are the issues marketing know customers are facing are they happy with your custo
5:59:43
you know products if there are if they are not happy and what kind of requirements are there which are not
5:59:49
being captured by your product so are they you know are they looking for you know uh premium features you know
5:59:56
product if the answer is yes then yes product as a product line manager you should think of uh upgrade upward
6:00:03
stretch wherein you would like to vertically extend the product line if they look for you know the customers are
6:00:09
very much price sensitive they would like to go for a budget product which even though it has a minimum basic
6:00:15
featur still they are okay because their application is in that that particular category in that case you can think of
6:00:21
vertically downward line extension you are creating a product cing to that
6:00:27
particular need so everything depends upon you know what kind of customer requirements are available if you
6:00:32
justify if you have good requirements which doesn't if you have the requirements which are not been captured
6:00:38
by your existing product portfolio then definitely you should go for product line extension even though it is nich Market
6:00:45
in fact you know I can take my example I work in the industry it is oligopoly so lamb research provides the machines or
6:00:54
our products are being used for uh cheap manufacturing and uh if I look at
6:01:00
overall industry we uh you know so we have one product line which is called as
6:01:06
hedge product line wherein we are complete Monopoly we have another product line called as a deposition product line for which there is a
6:01:12
competition from Applied Materials so it is oligopoly so we either are in
6:01:17
Monopoly or in oligopolistic environment as I told you know our profit margins are I don't sell any product which has a
6:01:24
profit margin less than 80 percentage if I sell a product with profit margin less than 80 percentage I have to I'm
6:01:32
answerable to all you know many many stakeholders there has to be a solid wherein I'll make profit marges less
6:01:38
than 80 percentage so that kind of industry I'm in very Niche industry uh but still are there any
6:01:44
possibilities for product line extension yes there are in fact I can give an example wherein uh uh current currently
6:01:51
whatever products are there in the market you know we are getting the feedback that they are not smart enough you know for example uh preventative
6:01:58
maintenance so for example uh identifying there is a feature called as
6:02:05
a predictive maintenance preventative maintenance predictive maintenance wherein it talks about even though your
6:02:10
machine has not been failed I have a feature which can tell that okay even though machine is working properly still
6:02:17
it might fail in future in next one month or two months so accordingly you
6:02:23
know uh you I can go for servicing and all those maintenance activities so that is called as a preventative maintenance
6:02:28
feature and customer was telling that suddenly one particular component fails and because of that the whole line gets
6:02:35
Disturbed and it is creating a huge billion dollar loss for the End customer so that was the problem statement so
6:02:41
what our company did did that you know we added lot of sensors and actuators in
6:02:48
in into our existing products which can cause what is the lifetime for those key
6:02:53
components which might get failed uh which might which which fails very frequently and then we launched a new
6:02:59
product called as a Sensi platform Sensi stands for there are multiple sensors are there and I can provide a feature
6:03:06
wherein I can tell okay boss your product is going your machine is going to get failed please go for maintenance
6:03:12
activity because of we and tier because of some signals are not coming properly or it has advanced di diagnostic
6:03:19
features so like that you know we created a new segment and basically we launched it into this was under vertical
6:03:25
product line extension it was uh uh upgrade upward vertical extension it was
6:03:31
more premium and accordingly we launched it and it was one of the success story for our company Sensi product from lamb
6:03:37
research so even though it is Niche there are possibilities okay I'm says good thank you just a quick info guys

BCG Matrix in Product Management
6:04:23
see my screen BCG metrix so okay last topic from module number nine uh BCG metrix even though I think uh you know
6:04:30
top three big Consulting companies which are all the top three big Consulting companies and any MBA graduate
6:04:36
graduate will have a dream to work in that company KPMG it is audio basically accounting
6:04:42
based so KPMG is Big Four e is also big four I was looking for big three yes K
6:04:49
say is mbb so what's the Lang form first one m stands for Mackenzie b stand for
6:04:55
uh BCG and last b stands for uh Ben Mackenzie BCG Ben mbb so these are Deo
6:05:02
PWC and all these are uh part of I think big four which are specifically to
6:05:08
accounting and financial Audits and all those sector but typically for Management Consultant Consulting uh
6:05:15
these are the three big forms mbb McKenzie BCG and Ben what Ken has mentioned so this is very famous metrix
6:05:22
from BCG BCG stands for Boston Boston Consulting Group so they came up with uh
6:05:28
uh this metrix so the BCG metrix also known as a bos Boston Consulting Group metrix is a strategic tool used in
6:05:34
product portfolio management to evaluate the potential of a company's product or business unit based on market growth
6:05:41
rate and market share uh it is developed by Boston BCG group and the Matrix helps companies to allocate resources allocate
6:05:48
Resources by identifying which product or business unit are worth investing in and which should be maintained and which
6:05:54
should be closed the MCG metrix classified the products or business into four categories so it's a typical 2x two
6:06:00
metrix you know on y- axis it is market growth rate and x-axis it is relative Market market share so imagine a case
6:06:07
wherein you are a product portfolio manager product line manager and you have you know four products and on
6:06:14
x-axis it talks about the product market share what is the market share for your product and on Y axis it talks about
6:06:20
overall what is the growth of that product overall growth you know of that product overall growth for the market
6:06:26
sorry Pardon Me overall growth for the market in which that product is served so there are four categories you know
6:06:33
the first quadrant is uh you have a product which has a huge market share and when you look at the market growth
6:06:40
for that product is also very high so we call it they they call it as a star pointer so they call it as a star okay
6:06:47
quadrant number one quadrant number uh third totally opposite you have very
6:06:52
less market share and overall market growth for that segment is also very very low so they call it as a dog fourth
6:07:00
quadrant very very interesting you have a huge market share but the market growth is is very very low so they call
6:07:06
it as a cash cow and the second quadrant wherein you have less market share but the growth is very high so it is a
6:07:13
question mark so that's how they categorize the you know product into these four quadrants and each quadrant
6:07:18
there is a different strategy to handle that product so let's try to understand what are those strategies so first one
6:07:24
star you know you remember this one star characteristics High market share high growth market so I have very huge market
6:07:31
share and overall the market is growing very high for that category STS are usually leading products in rapidly
6:07:37
growing industry so it requires significant investment to sustain the growth so what is your objective company
6:07:43
should focus on investing in and uh nurturing the Stars to eventually become
6:07:48
Cash Cow as the market grows market growth slows so just ignore the last last statement So eventually you have a
6:07:56
product in which you have huge market share and market growth is also very high so essentially you will be heavily
6:08:03
investing in that product you will put all your best resources to work on that product because the market growth is
6:08:10
also very high and your contri your your basically market share is also High you would like to capture maximum market for
6:08:18
that product so it is called as a star second one cash cow oh Gio market
6:08:24
share is high agree and market growth industry is also High correct there are
6:08:30
lot of people who are still not using you know smartphone in you know best phone in India so market growth is also
6:08:36
high so it is a good example yeah goo could be a star example let's talk about Cash Cow so wherein the market share is
6:08:43
high but the growth is very low so let's go to here market share is very high but
6:08:48
the growth is low so earlier you know the growth was very high but eventually technology has changed and now the
6:08:56
growth is low but you have a good amount of market share so what you will do these are called as a cash cow so
6:09:01
strategy Cash Cow generates stable and significant cash flow often minimum
6:09:06
investment since market growth is low so use the profit from cash C to fund the
6:09:12
stars and invest in uh question mark So essentially what they are telling so if you have a product in which you have
6:09:19
huge market share but uh market growth is low because it is on Lower technology and all it is telling don't kill the
6:09:25
product you provide the minimum investment minimum budgets minimum resources are required in order to
6:09:32
sustain that product since your market share is high and capture maximum revenue from the market so that's the
6:09:38
strategy they call it as a cash cow these are very commonly used terminologies in product world so they
6:09:43
say okay this product is Cash Cow this product is star so that's how it is Cash
6:09:48
Cow the third one is question mark so it is basically the characteristics is uh
6:09:54
you have very less market share but the growth is very high so question marks are often the new products or business
6:10:00
units that require substantial investment to increase their market share so so your share is low but the
6:10:07
growth is very high it could be because you are new entrant so what they say is that you should heavily invest for
6:10:12
question mark category also evaluate whether it is worth investing in growth this uh into star or diversify it into
6:10:20
diversify if they lack potential so essentially what we are telling is that the question mark your market share is
6:10:26
low but the growth is high so check the capability and if it is capable if it is
6:10:33
aligned with your overall company's vision and Mission whatever Revenue you are getting from Cash Cow please pump in
6:10:40
in uh these kind of categories question mark categories so that you will increase your market share because the
6:10:46
growth of this Market is very high last one is dog wherein you have less market share less growth so dogs are limited
6:10:53
growth potential and are not profitable and companies typically aim to Diest
6:10:59
stocks or uh reposition them as they drain resources without providing much
6:11:06
return so your market share is low return market growth is also low most of the cases typically the docs category
6:11:12
products are getting retired from the product portfolio so these are the decisions this is how you categorize
6:11:17
your products and accordingly you will make your product life cycle decisions on those products so you mean to say
6:11:23
because of high claim your market share is high but uh Market no but you should not look at uh how much revenue your
6:11:30
product is making y AIS talks about what is the market growth rate so the way in which I think um clearly talks about you
6:11:37
know Jo example where in market share was very high go is one of the dominant market share 5G when market growth is
6:11:44
also very because there are lot of potential lot of people are still they are not using U smartphone and they are
6:11:49
likely to be used likely to get converted to 5G based smartphone or 5G
6:11:55
Based Services where in Geo can C there that service so that that's how it is so why talks about overall market growth so
6:12:01
from indust insurance perspective what is the market growth for for insurance sector I think there are a lot of people
6:12:08
you know still they don't have insurance I think market growth is high for insurance sector and Rel to market share
6:12:13
if I take example of U you know uh LC LC
6:12:19
I would say their market share is high and there are couple of segments where in market growth is also so I don't
6:12:26
consider it as a second quadrant maybe we can look for some better examples basically this question mark quadrant
6:12:32
okay so anybody has any better example for question mark quadrant wherein you have the low market share and high market growth so we have I
6:12:39
think one clear so we discussed about star we discussed about question mark uh Cash Cow I think it is very much clear
6:12:45
you have huge market share but you know your product works on older technology so instead of killing what they say just
6:12:51
provide minimum resources required for example let's again this can C to 4G mobiles you know 4G mobiles from goo you
6:13:00
know they have their own handset it it can fall under very much cashco model where in market share for that mobile is
6:13:06
very high uh since it was very cheap and uh even though the market is moving
6:13:11
towards 5G based technology still there are lot of customer base who don't want to migrate to 5G they're happy with
6:13:16
their you know 4G phone so with minimum what Jo should do they should not
6:13:21
discontinue 4G based mobiles they should provide minimum resources required in order to sustain I know this particular
6:13:29
product line but they will get huge revenue from this one and they should use this Revenue either on question Mark
6:13:35
or on Star so that's how you should utilize the cashco and dogs very clear
6:13:41
you know low market share low potential kill them retire the product so that's
6:13:46
how you should uh understand this metrix very very famous metrics uh people at
6:13:53
cxo level they use this terminology this is star for our organization this is cashco for our organization this is Doc
6:13:59
for our organization so you should be able to understand uh what they are talking about okay how BCG metric
6:14:05
supports product portfolio management resource allocation helps to determine which product or business units needs
6:14:11
investment which generates cash which could be phased out strategic planning provides insights for developing growth
6:14:17
strategies for product with uh potential and managing mature products to maintain the profitability and uh balancing
6:14:25
portfolio ensure a balanced mix of product types star Cash Cow question
6:14:30
mark dogs with the both short-term and profitability and long-term growth so look at it from short-term profitability
6:14:37
long-term growth and accordingly you can act upon it example Star new uh newer
6:14:44
and high potential product like Advanced iPhone in growing markets this is good example Cash Cow established High
6:14:50
Revenue product like iPad and older iPhone models so Apple don't want to
6:14:56
discontinue these models they will still provide uh customer support for those models and they consider it as a cash go
6:15:02
because uh market share is high and uh but growth is low because they have
6:15:08
already launched the new models so that's how the cash cows are iPhone older models are considered as cashow
6:15:14
question mark you know emerging technology as Ken has rightly mentioned vertical farming like augmented reality
6:15:20
devices home pod which are in high growth Market but requires investment to increase the market share electric
6:15:27
vehicle also still it is not very new but still lot of in India I think there
6:15:33
is a huge potential and dog products with limited success in low growth areas which may be phased out or
6:15:39
deprioritized so see a lot of information is available in this uh Forum having said that I think that's it
6:15:46

product management so let's try to understand value okay so what is the meaning of
Value Creation: Understanding Customer Needs
6:16:33
creation using customer needs so it's a foundational Concept in product management that focus on creating a
6:16:40
product or service that address specific customer needs which s are for achieving customer satisfaction loyalty and
6:16:46
long-term business understand the customer need you know the first step is identify
6:16:52
customer need in order to create a value so we first do work with marketing team
6:16:57
to identify customer pinpoint areas the first step of value creation is identify what customer actually want or what is
6:17:03
their want or what is their need can be evolved this can be done by conducting
6:17:09
Mar capture voice of customers surveys interviews Focus okay uh prioritize the
6:17:15
need based on value you know again this portion we understood converting those um requirement into features then
6:17:22
prioritization of features we understood multiple Frameworks are being used in order to prioritize the features mow
6:17:28
model cono model two more so yeah so this we we know how to
6:17:35
do it and then third point is new Define the value proposition once the needs are
6:17:40
understood product manager work to articulate a clear value proposition for the product so what is value proposition
6:17:47
so this is the statement that describes how the product or service solve the custom and improves customer situation
6:17:54
the specific benefits customer can expect and why they should choose your product you call it as a value
6:18:00
proposition some people call it as a USP what is the USP of your product some people quties what is the value
6:18:05
proposition of your product so why customer should buy your product essentially you have to Define that
6:18:10
value proposition a strong value proposition is critical for aligning product development efforts with
6:18:16
customer expectation so you supposed to have comp uh which will motivate all which
6:18:25
should drive overall development process and which also should include uh customer uh once you have developed a
6:18:32
value proposition designing the solutions around the need so in this St product manager collaborate with you know we know design engineer and other
6:18:39
teams to create a solution teller to these identified needs this might involve uh developing new features
6:18:46
improving it could be existing improving the existing features or even even uh
6:18:52
reaging prototyping usability testing are often used to validate the solution
6:18:57
whether solution addresses the customer needs effectively before going for volume prod volume launch or volume
6:19:05
okay so designing so the need Point number five is continuous learning you know you that's what we do as a part of
6:19:11
MVP you use aile methodology you develop you know segregate your overall product
6:19:17
development into small small packets you go for um prototyping it could be low
6:19:22
Fidelity or High Fidelity you create a MVP for that U set of functions features
6:19:29
you release it for some targeted customers you ask them to use it you learn the feedback and accordingly you
6:19:35
improve it so it's continuous learning process so that's how overall you are so
6:19:40
just to give couple of examples uh identifying the customer needs let's take example of fitness app company
6:19:47
wants to improve the user engagement through surveys and interviews they understood that um their user base you
6:19:54
know whatever Target you there they are struggling to St to work to work out
6:20:00
alone and are often Unsure how to vary the ex exercise routine so that's the
6:20:06
problem statement so what approach uh they conducted you know detailed Market
6:20:12
survey to identify pin points by analyzing survey responses conducting interviews they find that many users
6:20:19
want accountability and personalized exercise plan to stay on
6:20:25
track okay so that's the customer need customer so prioritization you know so
6:20:33
let's in this case I think uh let's use Koo model so example in this fitness app case uh the team identifies several
6:20:41
potential improvements so it could be social features for accountability
6:20:46
personalized work workout plan uh gamified rewards they realize that
6:20:53
uh personalized workout plan address a primary user pinpoint and might provide
6:20:59
most uh Direct Value these are the pinpoint areas and the feature is so
6:21:05
personalized so approach is let's use Koo model so basic need must have is
6:21:11
reliable workout tracking so in personalized plan you have multiple features so first feature you know basic
6:21:17
feature it should have reliable work uh performance need uh personalized
6:21:23
workout plans and excitement need uh gamified rewards you know you can it
6:21:28
will capture how many calories you have burned and accordingly you'll get some points so that is the excitement need so
6:21:33
they decided to prioritize personalized plans and schedule socialized features
6:21:39
and gamification for lat releases ensuring that uh the solutions will have
6:21:44
an immediate impact so that's how you understood customer pinpoint areas converted into Dem into features
6:21:51
prioritize them prioritize the features and accordingly you decided okay which features I would like to go for current
6:21:58
development development what is the value proposition example for this application
6:22:05
you know value proposition is stay motivated with fitness app that provides
6:22:10
provides personalized workout plan teller uh helping you build
6:22:16
consistency accountability and Variety in your Fitness routine yeah yeah so
6:22:22
there are two things what you need to do once you get this kind of feedback that okay I have done thorough research based
6:22:28
on that I launched one product into the market or feature into the you know in the product and then I launched it and
6:22:33
then I get kind of negative feedback people are not happy with M features so try to understand why they are not happy
6:22:41
you know that's where continuous learning and itation come into the picture you know they might say processor is slow it is giving it is
6:22:47
very slow they might say you know the UI is not good they might say okay this you
6:22:52
should have some additional features along with this feature so like that you'll get some feedback so incorporate
6:22:57
that feature incorporate that uh you know feedback and accordingly enhance your feature that is the first thing you
6:23:04
do it parall so since you are getting the negative feedback that means this feedback was never been captured during
6:23:12
your first level of market research there were additional needs which were not properly captured so you have as a
6:23:18
Lessons Learned you have to capture all those things and you have to make sure that whenever you are floting the surveys for your next product or you
6:23:24
know next iteration of existing product you have to ensure that all those lessons are captured and your uh you
6:23:30
know kind of questions you ask in the interview what kind of survey questions you ask in the surveys these are very
6:23:35
well matured so that in the next iteration at least you get actual pulse of the market so these are the two steps
6:23:42
you should do it as a part of uh yeah so this is the example for each of these step identify customer
6:23:48
needs of fitness app so you did the con model defining the value proposition it's important you as a product manager
6:23:54
should have very much clarity about what value what is the value propos designing the solutions so I
6:24:00
think process tracker and all uh fine so you any questions on
6:24:06
value proposition so value proposition is unique selling point why customer should buy your product or service uh a
6:24:15
simple okay uh designing Solutions yeah once you have value proposition example the fitness has team decided to add a
6:24:22
new features that offer customiz workout plan based on user preferences okay
6:24:27
personalized Fitness levels the feature also includes uh progress tracker that
6:24:33
helps users to visual I their achievement over time okay it will have a very good dashboard about how what is
6:24:39
the progress what you did in last week what you did in last month approach uh
6:24:45
you know collaborate with us designer and engineer uh to develop a prototype for the personalized workout planner
6:24:52
they conduct a usability test to ensure that user can effectively navigate the features customize their plans track
6:24:59
progress feedback from this test is used to refine the design before full skilles
6:25:06
implementation like prototype or MVP kind of approach but uh see once you have value proposition once you have
6:25:12
problem statement you came up with a solution and then you know aile methodology uiux development MVP will
6:25:17
come come into the picture continuous learning as we discussed with I think Shang uh you get a feedback you improve
6:25:23
you get a feedback you improve and you make sure that you are on track so that's the overall process about value
6:25:28
creation important factor is value proposition we understood what is value proposition
6:25:34
so for example now I worked in three organizations so I kind of thought okay
Defining Value Creation
6:25:40
what is the value proposition for my organization so if I look at lamb research so I created a value
6:25:48
proposition so it is a leader in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and services and it empowers the world's
6:25:55
top chipmaker it could be Intel it could be dsmc to achieve unprecedented
6:26:01
efficiency Innovation and precision products are highly efficient our
6:26:06
products are very much Innovative our products are basically they give very good uh Precision for those applications
6:26:15
our advanced wafer fabrication equipment and process Solutions are designed to meet demands for rapidly evolving
6:26:22
digital words so some since now everything is becoming digital you know we have a lot of uh iot devices
6:26:30
everything is becoming digital so that's where our company will come into the picture for all those semiconductor manufacturing we are the one who are
6:26:36
going to provide the solution enabling creation of Next Generation electronics that drive the global progress so it's
6:26:42
bit complex and comprehensive but this is the value proposition for my organization so previously I worked in
6:26:48
Mercedes-Benz so what is the value proposition for mercedesbenz so it's uh Mercedes-Benz is like icon for luxury
6:26:55
performance and Innovation provides more than just a vehicle you know it delivers
6:27:01
unparalleled uh Driving Experience get a Best Driving Experience uh EMB voiding Elegance
6:27:08
Cutting Edge technology commitment to Quality each
6:27:14
Mercedes vehicle is crafted uh to elevate uh everyday Journey combining
6:27:19
Heritage with Visionary advancement that shapes future automative luxury what is the unique selling point
6:27:26
for Mercedes-Benz you get uh very good Driving Experience Mercedes is known for
6:27:32
its uh luxury features that is the value proposition so
6:27:37
nowbody tell me what is the value proposition for your organization you need not to make a comprehensive line
6:27:45
maybe you tell me what are the unique saving points for your organization maybe I'll take three examples and then
6:27:50
we can move to the next okay good so since we understood
Value Communication Strategies
6:27:55
the value proposition concept and we understood how do we create a value now
6:28:01
second Point as a product man manager responsible for communicating
6:28:08
the so there are some best practices you know so communication strategies these
6:28:13
are the methods tactics used to convey the products value to customer effici uh this involves clearly
6:28:20
communicating how the product meets customer needs stands out from competitor and provides benefit that so
6:28:26
there are some best practices I think uh there are eight one first one is uh craft clear value proposition you know a
6:28:34
well- defined value proposition serves as the foundation for Value communication you should have very clear
6:28:39
simple value proposition easy to understand concise statement that explain what makes this product valuable
6:28:45
or unique this statement should highlight the specific customer needs you know uh the product addresses the
6:28:52
key benefits it provides and what differentiates it from the competitor um so please menure make sure
6:28:58
that you know I think we had three criteria one is um size it should f
6:29:04
focus on customer need benefits it provides and what it what differentiate it from competitor so that's how it
6:29:10
should be example product is an eco-friendly cleaning solution the value proposition should be an eco-friendly
6:29:17
cleaning product that is safe for your family and effective on tough St without
6:29:25
harming the environment so that's the value proposition so make sure that uh
6:29:30
you cover all those three aspects second best practice understand
6:29:36
uh the segmentation or target audience you know this you will do it as a part of marketing you know you know what is
6:29:41
your target audience so you should have good understanding about your target audience so what it talks about
6:29:47
effective communication requires deep understanding about okay which are all the target audience for this product
6:29:54
segment tailoring this so that you can customize taor this message to resonate with each segment's specific needs and
6:30:02
segment allow for targeted messaging that speaks directly to the pin points
6:30:07
or desires a specific whether based on demographics or or buying motives example you know
6:30:15
for all natural skincare brand segments could include environmentally conscious
6:30:21
customer people with sensitive skin Health focused individuals each group would receive tailored message that
6:30:28
aligns with their specific value and the concerns so try to understand you know
6:30:34
the tar target audience and based on that audience you have to tailor your
6:30:39
value proposition for your product so you might have some variants you know you might have variant for sensitive
6:30:45
skin you might have some you know variant for oily skin accordingly you have you know that product variant and
6:30:52
accordingly you can customize the value proposition for your product
6:30:57
considering so go back to you know big picture when you do U Capstone project
6:31:04
it is expected that you will include all those points when you are drafting a
6:31:09
value proposition choosing the right Communication channel very very important so because uh different
6:31:16
customers engage on a different platforms so selecting a right channel is crucial to reach the intended
6:31:21
audience uh Channel may include you know social media email marketing in apple notification blogs influencers
6:31:29
partnership or instore display depending upon whether the target audience
6:31:34
whether where the target audience spend the time so for example if you are
6:31:39
looking for your target audience if it is Young Generation you can go for Instagram or Tik Tok where they spend more time because there could be more
6:31:47
effective platforms for you know if you are Target audiences business Professionals for example if you are
6:31:53
doing the value proposition for jira or tro project management still product
6:31:58
project management kind of application or product in that case more likely you will choose linked
6:32:05
or Instagram or Tik Tac because that is more suitable platform for that application so
6:32:11
choose another best practice is use storytelling to highlight benefits and solutions so storytelling can make
6:32:18
products value feel relatable or memorable this involves uh sharing real world scenarios customer testimonials or
6:32:26
brand stories that show how the product solves the problem or enhances customer life storytelling also helps uh humanize
6:32:34
the brand making it easier for customers to connect so it is kind of emotional connect so a fitness tracker band might
6:32:41
share the story of customer who use the product to achieve their health goals
6:32:46
showing how it has transformed their uh daily habits and help them to lead
6:32:52
healthier lifestyle so now slowly we are we are trying to understand okay the
6:32:58
impact of these value propositions the kind of advertise you will put is also depend upon the value proposition your
6:33:04
target group so uh storytelling will come into the picture so you need to come up with some testimonials so some
6:33:10
this guy you know he had a problem he started utilizing our product and he got
6:33:16
benefited so try to keep you more storytelling to have emotional connect
6:33:21
with another we have a couple of more best practices focus on benefits or features
6:33:29
features you know it is like a theoretical explanation about features and you know in detail but you focus on
6:33:35
more benefits what customer is going to get so rather than just long battery
6:33:41
life in the product can be position positioned as enabling you to stay connected throughout your day without
6:33:47
worrying about Char recharging so look at it from um position in
6:33:54
position it from customer benefit it's very good example you know are going to develop a value
6:34:01
proposition for for example uh earpod so you should not say okay I
6:34:07
have a long battery life instead of that you can positioning it as enabling this use this product which will enable you
6:34:13
to stay connected throughout your day without worrying about recharging so
6:34:18
focus on features not focus on benefits sorry not features that's the message
6:34:25
build trust credibility trust building tactics include showcasing reviews
6:34:31
testimonials case studies export endorsements or guarantees to reassure
6:34:37
the customers of products Effectiveness and reliability authenticity is critical
6:34:42
here as junion viewer or indust can significantly influence purchase
6:34:47
decisions example a Milky delivery service could share the customer testimonials and ratings on their
6:34:53
website and offer satisfaction guarantee to remove the risk of first time risk
6:35:00
for first time customers so use those you know customer testimonials and
6:35:07
ratings on website so that you know you can pull in the first time buyers so
6:35:13
build the trust build the credibility ensure uh consistency across
6:35:18
touch points for the value message to resonate it needs to be consistent across all customer touch points from
6:35:25
ads to social medias to website content cemail so you should have a single theme which resonates with the different uh
6:35:32
platforms what we are going to to use it a consistent message build Brands recognition and reinforces the product
6:35:39
value create a cohesive brand experience that strengths the customer trust and loyalty a premium luggage brand that
6:35:47
emphasize durability and elegance should reflect these values across every channel from its website design
6:35:53
packaging to its customer service approach so everywhere you should focus on um you know durability
6:36:00
Elegance try to remain consistent and adapt to message over time you know
6:36:06
as customer needs and Market changes dynamically you should uh adapt it over
6:36:11
period of time so productivity app might initially emphasize on time saving features but lat Bots it to work life
6:36:19
balance as more user seek solutions to manage remote works so adapt it over a period of time so these are kind of uh
6:36:26
best practices in when it comes to value proposition so value proposition uh should be clear you
6:36:33
should understand target audience and accordingly you should put use the right channel in order to use those advertise
6:36:40
and all those activities use the storytelling use testimonials focus on
6:36:46
benefits you remain consistent build trust and credibility
6:36:51
and um be flexible to adopt over a period of as I told when I ask you to
6:36:58
develop a value proposition for your product I'm expecting that you use all those best practice okay uh co-creation
Co-Creation with Customers
6:37:06
with customer I think a small topic uh so co-creation with customer plays a
6:37:11
powerful role in enhancing value communication by involving customer in the product development and messaging process this approach allows companies
6:37:18
to understand and integrate customer insights directly resulting in products and messaging that uh resonate more
6:37:25
effectively so exam Nell message is uh be customer Centric so you are bringing
6:37:32
customer in all those steps and directly align with customer needs and preferences so by involving customer
6:37:37
early companies get clear understanding of their needs preferences and expectations this uh firsthand knowledge
6:37:43
leads to more relevant product features and benefits which are easier to communicate effectively so always
6:37:50
have uh keep the customer centricity a software company working with customer
6:37:55
during the development might learn that customer value Simplicity and speed or
6:38:00
extra features leading them to focus their message ing on those score benefits so that's the whole intent of
6:38:07
going for Agile development going for MVP wherein you capture the customer feedback immediately so and you learn on
6:38:15
it so directly align with customer needs and preferences so when you are working
6:38:20
on value proposition there also you develop it talk to your Target customers
6:38:25
and accordingly adjust it building authentic stories and testimonials I think we discussed
6:38:32
creating a sense of ownership and loyalty um to take an example a car company involves customer in design
6:38:38
choice for a new model can Inspire participants to advocate for brand as
6:38:43
they feel a personal connect to the product and its story so when customer
6:38:49
feel involved in the creating product they are more likely to feel invested in it it turn share positive word of mouth
6:38:57
or act as a brand ambassador so typically they do it you know it is very smart marketing
6:39:03
you know you ask customer for uh the options you basically give options and ask customer okay I'm trying to develop
6:39:10
a new vehicle you tell me what kind of specifications I should finalize then customer will vote for it it is more
6:39:17
likely that those people have voted for it they will get converted into your customers sense of ownership royalty
6:39:24
generate feedback for Clear customer Centric messaging a skincare brand testing prototype with customer learns
6:39:30
that the user describes the product as caling in guiding the Brand's message to
6:39:36
reflect these attributes instead of technical J as I think we learned in best practices focus on benefits rather
6:39:43
than features and Tech increase trust and transparency a te company shares uh
6:39:49
behind the scene look at customer testing and feedback process shows the
6:39:55
potential customer that product has been validated by real user strengthening the trust so this is this comes into the
6:40:00
picture when you're finalizing the ad content so behind the scene you know how did you develop the product how did you tested
6:40:08
the product so you you you are increasing the Trust basically uh staying responsive to your
6:40:14
all customer Centric needs uh cocreation is a continuous feedback loop that allows Brands to stay
6:40:22
attenuated to changing customer needs and preferences making it easier to update messaging and keep it relevant a
6:40:29
beverage company for example regularly works with customer to might update its uh marketing to
6:40:36
highlight the newer flavor developed based on the customer demand and showing responsiveness to
6:40:41
customer uh reducing assumptions and increase product Market fit uh by
6:40:46
involving customers directly company minimizes the risk of misjudging what customer value most the product a
6:40:54
product that can genuinely meet the customer needs is easier to communicate effectively as it delivers a real
6:41:01
demonstrable value an app developer involving user in early testing avoids
6:41:07
adding unnecessary features allowing for straightforward value messaging focused on the core benefits so involve them
6:41:13
earlier learn from them learn from the initial feedback create a community of
6:41:19
engaged users and other best practice co-creation Foster community of engaged
6:41:24
customers who feel they are contributed to the product success creating an organic network of Advocates who shares
6:41:32
their positive experience say the amplifying the value communication a fashion brand that invol invites
6:41:38
customer who vote on the new designs create a loyal fan base then shares a
6:41:45
product news and purchase in support of the brand Mission so invol them use
6:41:50
Community discussions for positive publicity so these are kind of
6:41:56
best practices in value communication mostly when it comes to developing ad campaign you have to ensure that this
6:42:02
point are again uh these are good to know you are not the one who is going to decide
6:42:09
the ad campaign but uh when you know marketing has developed an
6:42:14
ad campaign you have to assess that whether it touches all those points whether it is a clear whether it
6:42:21
understand whether it is Alli with target market are we using the right channels uh are we using you know kind
6:42:28
of testimonials are we covering are we explaining the benefits or are we talking about feature
6:42:35
uh all those things you can Target and atically you can provide the approval for that particular ad campaign or
6:42:43
explaining the value proposition to the End customer so this is the lesson from this this one typically during ad
6:42:51
campaigns we have to make sure that you are assessing the message with reference
6:42:56
to so see if You observe always we are uh working with some stakeholder and we
6:43:01
are trying to have the basic B understanding of that domain so earlier you know to capture the customer
6:43:08
requirement we worked with marketing team we understood okay how they capture the voice of customers so even though it
6:43:14
is their roles and responsibilities you should know how they do it because you are the product manager you should ask them the right questions so now it comes
6:43:21
value proposition value proposition okay you are the one who will Define the value proposition for your product but
6:43:27
value delivery is mostly you know they do it ad campaigns and all marketing team they do it but while are you
6:43:33
learning all these things because you should be able to ask them the right questions and you should be able to check whether it aligns with the best
6:43:39
practices in okay so I hope you guys got a good uh
6:43:44
understanding about value proposition best practices for Value communication uh value delivery you know
Value Delivery: Traditional vs Contemporary Models
6:43:51
traditional versus contemporary models uh there are couple of differences so let's try to understand
6:43:57
and traditional value delivery model and contemporary value delivery model uh traditional model focus on delivery
6:44:04
value at a single point of time like you know product purchase while contemporary models emphasize on ongoing value
6:44:11
creation customer centricity and adaptability so let's try to go in
6:44:16
detail about what is the traditional value delivery models a traditional model are often product focused and
6:44:23
transactional in nature emphasizing on delivery of finished product to the customer the relationship between
6:44:29
company and the customer usually ends up when the trans once the transaction is complete completed you sell it that's it
6:44:35
you know the relationship is over over there here there are some key characteristics for traditional so
6:44:42
product Centric approach you know traditional models focus on product Centric approach primary source of value with
6:44:48
limited emphasis on additional services and customization uh linear process value delivery follow straightforward
6:44:54
process you can call it as a linear or you can call it as a waterfall methodology uh design production
6:45:00
Marketing sales single line there no MVP prototype concept once the product is
6:45:06
reached its customer the delivery of the value is considered as complete uh limited customer interaction
6:45:12
post sales uh traditional models companies usually usually have limited engagement
6:45:17
with end customers after the sale customer feedback may be collected periodically uh or after signif and some
6:45:25
some delays basically you not actually engaged with customer after actively engaged with customer post sale
6:45:31
standardization products are products and services are usually standardized for mass production delivery with little
6:45:37
flexibility for customization personalization like a brick and motor retail company you know this is very
6:45:43
famous uh case study uh traditional manufacturing and utility service like
6:45:50
uh water electricity where things are very fixed and uh product Centric linear
6:45:56
process and now if you see the Contemporary models wherein you know they're more customer Centric dynamic
6:46:02
they put put more emphasiz on um ongoing engagement value creation they often
6:46:07
include Services customization digital interaction that extends beyond the initial transaction the characteristics
6:46:15
is customer Centric experience driven contemporary models focus on understanding the customer needs and
6:46:21
delivery personalized uh or adapting value over time iterative and agile
6:46:28
processes instead of waterfall it is iterative agile process continous ly refine the products based on prototypes
6:46:35
MVPs and service based on real time customer feedback often using agile or lean
6:46:40
methodologies ongoing relationship with customer so these models emphasizing building a long-term relationship with
6:46:47
customer providing continuous support and updates and enhancement to ensure
6:46:52
that sustained value is delivered again you know pricing is also varying you know it is not a onetime
6:46:59
price you have subscription or SAS based models where in many companies they have moved uh subscription or software as a
6:47:06
service models where customers pay over time for continuous access of the product and update and
6:47:12
services uh digital transformation Dem more data driven you know digital tools
6:47:18
data analytics AI allow realtime feedback targeted marketing personalized
6:47:24
experienes technology platforms enables business to deliver more interactively and efficient process
6:47:33
examples you know go for Netflix Spotify wherein you have
6:47:39
uh you're going for software as a service you have subscription based models Source Platforms in fact adob B
6:47:48
Creative Cloud Microsoft 365 e-commerce with the customer relationship management Amazon you have
6:47:55
Amazon Prime membership direct to customer Brands offer personalized and ongoing supports so let's take a side by
6:48:02
side comparison traditional model they were very much product specific new models are customer
6:48:08
Centric process you know waterer or linear here it is more like agile method
6:48:14
customer relationship was very much transaction based you know limited post sales engagement but here uh it is
6:48:21
ongoing we are basically calculating what is the um overall cost to the
6:48:28
customer not only customer will buy the product and basically he will go come to
6:48:33
you for a maintenance he will come to you for upgrades he will go for additional come to you for additional services so overall you will have
6:48:40
overall cost to the customer that perspective rather than onetime settlement customization limited here
6:48:47
High customization Revenue model one time purchase it is subscription based feedback loop delayed or limited
6:48:53
feedback here you are getting continuous feedback D development also and during post launch also technology role very
6:49:01
much limited you use traditional systems here it is extensive data driv digital
6:49:06
tools so these are the value delivery methods traditional versus contemporary
6:49:12
mostly now every compan is focused on contemporary everybody has now moved
6:49:17
from agile to Waterfall to Agile and uh many in fact you know you can take a
6:49:23
product which is as complex as uh Aeroplane engine now uh I think boing
6:49:30
buys the Aeroplane engine from General Electric and General Electric earlier
6:49:36
they were selling those engines to boing but now they are selling this engine on a paper use basis whereing boing need
6:49:43
not to buy those engines as a onetime purchase they will use it and based on
6:49:49
the usage they will pay money to the General Electric so in fact you know in
6:49:54
complex Hardware Industries also things are getting changed from onetime purchase to subscription
6:50:01
base so this is is the side by side comparison some examples Automotive
6:50:07
traditional Car Sales follow transactional models where customer buy the car and the value delivery largely
6:50:13
ends up at the time of sale except you know occasional servicing but uh
6:50:19
contemporary for example Tesla you know you you get continuous software updates that improve the vehicle performance add
6:50:25
features over time enhancing value delivery post purchase let us take software as an example so software was
6:50:31
sold one time Li cost you know earlier versions of Microsoft Office uh user had
6:50:38
to buy a new versions for upgrade for example and now new versions 365 subscription based model you know
6:50:45
customer receives regular updates regular book fix cloud storage ongoing support creating continuous value same
6:50:52
is the case with e-commerce uh traditional brick and motor storage stores primarily focused on single
6:50:58
transactions contemporary Amazon offers seamless dat driven shopping experience with personalized recommendations Prime
6:51:04
Membership easy returns creating ongoing value engagement so benefits increase
6:51:10
customer relation retention ongoing relationship with and customer continuous updates encourage Customer
6:51:18
Loyalty as a customer you'll get lot of flexibility agility companies can adapt improve products based on realtime
6:51:24
feedback from customers from company side and you from user side you get a lot of flexibility if you don't like
6:51:30
product you company is willing to take that take back that product let's for example Amazon they offer services
6:51:38
like send back the product within 7 days or 10 days if you are not happy with the product performance personalized
6:51:44
experiences customers are received tailored experience and solutions that directly address unique needs uh new
6:51:51
revenue revenue streams subscription based models can provide more predictable and sustained Revenue rather
6:51:57
than you know onetime purchase where in forecasting is very difficult these are uh key differences between traditional
6:52:03
and cont it is it falls under value delivery how you would like to
6:52:09
say so what did we understood so far I think before going to Ports I think uh
6:52:14
that was next topic you understood value proposition uh how to develop a value
6:52:19
proposition how to communicate the value how to co-create with customer typically
6:52:25
how to assess the marketing uh when it comes to Value delivery we understood these two are the models traditional
6:52:31
versus contemp we understood their differences and what is the industry Trend things are moving
6:52:38
to so these are the per okay fine clear so now next topic
6:52:44
very important uh we are going to learn the new framework it called as a Porter's value chain framework or
Porter's Value Chain Analysis
6:52:51
analysis uh Porter is the person who has done lot of work in uh strategy value
6:52:58
proposition I think those of you who have uh done Masters in Business
6:53:04
Administration you might have gone through this framework so what is that framework so
6:53:11
what he does what Porter says he came up with a framework developed by Michael Porter his name is Michael Porter that
6:53:17
helps businesses to understand the specific activities within the operation that creates value for customer and
6:53:24
ultimately contribute to the competitive Advantage the model breaks down the company's processes into primary
6:53:31
activities and supporting activities is highlighting how each activity adds the value and how they
6:53:38
interact to create a value chain as a product manager you should
6:53:44
know what are the basically uh uh where
6:53:50
is your product is positioned so what are the primary activities what are the supporting so let's take example of uh
6:53:57
so this is basically a companywide so primary activities for example uh uh
6:54:03
these are the core activities directly involved in creating and delivering the products or service so they include uh
6:54:10
for examp they divided primary activities into four 1 2 3 four five categories inbound Logistics operations
6:54:17
outbound Logistics marketing and sales and service so look at it from you know
6:54:22
organization perspective Some Noise Okay so inbound Logistics so activities related to receiving and storing and
6:54:29
managing the inputs like a raw material components inventory efficient inbound Logistics can reduce
6:54:36
the cost and ensure smooth production process so this is something what you get
6:54:42
input operations the activities that transform inputs into the final product
6:54:47
such as manufacturing assembly packaging streamlining the operations can increase
6:54:52
the productivity and reduce the production cost and then output outbound Logistics
6:54:59
it is basically the outcome of your uh operations activities involved Distributing and finishing the product
6:55:06
uh finished product to the customer uh this can include warehousing order
6:55:11
fulfillment and delivery effective outbound Logistics can reduce the delivery times and enhance uh customer
6:55:19
satisfaction uh and then Marketing sales and services I think these are self-explanatory activities aimed at
6:55:25
promoting and selling the product such as advertising pricing strategies and
6:55:31
sales tactics uh strong marketing and sales can increase the brand visibility and drive
6:55:37
demand service basically the anything which comes after post sales activities that supports customer including you
6:55:44
know product installation training maintenance customer service effective service can build customer loyalty and
6:55:50
lead to repeat business so these are typically primary activities for the
6:55:56
organization what are the supporting activities uh these are auxiliary activities that help primary activities
6:56:02
to smoothly and efficiently they include firm infrastructure uh this covers
6:56:07
organizational structure management Financial legal all admin activities legal activities finance
6:56:13
activities uh other administrative functions that keep business running a well structured infrastructure support
6:56:20
efficient decision making and resource allocation then Human Resource Management activities related to
6:56:25
recruiting training and development a strong practices helps to attract Talent enhance productivity fer employee
6:56:33
satisfaction uh technology development this include R&D product design process
6:56:39
automation technology management of all which enhances efficiency and Innovation
6:56:45
advanced technology can streamline the operations reduce cost and provide Competitive Edge procurement you know
6:56:52
activities focused on acquiring resources material Services needed for production if effective procurement
6:56:58
ensures that input are of high quality and cost effective supporting value
6:57:04
Creation in operations and Logistics so that's how portter has divided the primary activities and
6:57:10
secondary activities there is very good graphical representation I think let me go back to
6:57:17
that graphical representation so this is your primary activities inbound Logistics operations outbound Logistics
6:57:24
marketing and sales customer service and supporting activities uh
6:57:29
from uh human resource management technology development procurement so that's how uh driving for
6:57:38
your product or for your so another concept value creation and competitive Advantage supporters
6:57:45
model emphasize that each activity in the value chain has potential to add value and impact company's uh cost
6:57:53
structure by optimizing and coordinate coordinating these activities businesses
6:57:59
can either reduce the cost or differentiate themselves from the competition so see this is very very
6:58:06
important okay I when I learned this concept I really appreciated this
6:58:13
framework you take any industry okay either you you have multiple competition
6:58:20
either you are cost leader or you should be differentiator so what is the meaning of
6:58:26
cost leadership so or cost Advantage identifying and reducing efficiencies across the value chain
6:58:32
negotiating it for better contracts in procurement or automating the process in operations companies can lower their
6:58:39
overall cost and differentiating basically companies can enhance certain value activities to create a unique
6:58:45
offering that sets them apart providing uh Superior customer service using
6:58:51
cutting a technology or creating a distinct brand image so whatever work you are doing on
6:58:58
your product either it should lead into a cost reduction or it should lead into
6:59:03
your different so applying Port so that's the overall summary why we are
6:59:08
learning all those things applying pters value CH analysis to identify the key
6:59:14
areas of improvement by analyzing the each activity companies can spot on the areas to improve the efficiency
6:59:21
quality optimize resources or reduce the cost enhance value for the customer by
6:59:27
focusing on the activities that directly impact customer satisfaction such as service and product qual Quality
6:59:32
Companies can strength uh proposition uh Benchmark against competition companies can
6:59:40
compare the value chain activities with competitors to identify the gaps and opportunities for
6:59:45
compet so let's take example okay lot of theory let's take example of a retail
6:59:50
company uh what are the typical inbound activities retail company will do uh
6:59:55
streamlining supplier uh relationship to get high quality products quickly
7:00:02
at a lower cost so what operations does using technology to improve the inventory management and reduce the
7:00:08
stock outs so you can imagine the case of Amazon or Flipkart in B Logistics streamline the supply relationship get
7:00:15
high quality products at lower cost operations use the technology for inventory management you reduce the
7:00:21
stock outs outbond uh you are partner partnering with logistic firms to fast
7:00:27
delivery and implementing the order tracking marketing and sales leveraging data to for personalized
7:00:34
marketing uh services offer robust return policy in all those return policies excellent customer services
7:00:40
warranties and all to increase the customer satisfaction so these are the activities you
7:00:46
doing I think same thing is represented here in bond Logistics reception
7:00:51
warehousing distribution operations transformation of input into the output
7:00:58
storage Transportation product distribution then marketing and sales Salesforce and
7:01:05
advertising warranty maintaining and upgrades par these are the primary activities secondary activities you have
7:01:11
systems you have routines you have human resources management technology procurement and resources
7:01:21
ensure essentially taking essentially talking you take any organization it
7:01:26
could be software Hardware you have some inputs you are doing some operations and at the end you are providing some output
7:01:33
you have marketing and sales you have customer service these are your primary activities which are going on in your organization parall you have some
7:01:39
support functions and accordingly each department is positioned so you should
7:01:45
have uh the clarity about what are your primary activities what are your supporting activities in the
7:01:50
organization so that's where they use this framework and typically you know for when it comes to cost reduction and
7:01:56
all those activities they will check which are all those activities which are adding more value to the customer or
7:02:02
adding list vales values to the customer and how many of these activities can be outsourced accordingly they are uh if
7:02:09
there is a need for cost reduction they will uh eliminate those activities and they will ask you know they will uh
7:02:15
delegate these activities to some third party supplier who will do this activity for your company so that's how they a
7:02:23
question so let me answer so let me set the context so apple is the company who
7:02:29
makes you know all those iPhones and iPads and they have outsourced the manufacturing to a company who does the
7:02:36
manufacturing of all those apple so now why did they decided not to
7:02:41
make it instead of that they have outsourced it because if Apple manufacture a one
7:02:47
mobile in California or you know if they manufacture in their facility it might
7:02:53
cause you know just take a hypothetical case of $100 per piece but if they
7:02:59
Outsource it I think the fox will charge not more than 40 to
7:03:05
50 why it is the case so there one more I think concept will come into the
7:03:11
picture it is called as economies of scale economies of scale so what is that
7:03:16
economies of scale so let go to Chrome I think we might have some
7:03:23
B describe it okay yeah I think this is the graph
7:03:28
what I okay can I have simple graph okay so if
7:03:35
you take this this uh graph you know on y- axis it talks about what is the cost of manufacturing and on x-axis it is
7:03:42
basically the number of units being manufactured so if you see uh if Apple
7:03:49
has to manufacture you know there will be there will be a good amount of
7:03:55
manufacturing but typically what fox foxcon does it they not only manufacture for Apple they will manufacture it for
7:04:01
multiple companies so it is basically manufacturing company so since they have volume benefits the cost per piece is
7:04:08
very very low so that's the only reason you know Apple has decided that okay instead of me manufacturing it I'll ask
7:04:14
foxcon to manufacture it because if they manufacture it the cost per piece is very very low and I'm telling you
7:04:20
typically that Val the difference is almost in the order of 30 to 40 percentage if appen manufacture it if
7:04:26
the cost is $100 if they man get it manufactured from foxcon
7:04:32
including foxcon profit it will not cost more than $40 per Apple so that kind of
7:04:37
benefits they will get it that's the reason they have decided to Outsource it but I think both uh both the guys who
7:04:44
have amol and I think a they have brought very very good point what about quality okay because Opel is such a Prem
7:04:51
branded product how they are mentioning you know how they are ensuring that product is built with a proper quality
7:04:57
so in that case you know uh Apple will ask a detailed manufacturing process
7:05:03
related documents from foxcon how are you going to manufacture it there will be detailed quality audits from Apple
7:05:09
side and I don't know how many of you are aware there well there is uh dfma document I think those who are in
7:05:15
overall from manufacturing side design process flow effect analysis uh there will be pfme documents
7:05:23
uh so which talks about what are the different ways in which uh manufacturing you you might get some error during
7:05:29
manufacturing process so all those things are captured there will be thorough assessment there will there are quality checks present at each
7:05:35
particular uh after every step and they are checking the quality and after once
7:05:41
the product is product is compliant with all the quality checks then only it is allowed to go after end of life end of
7:05:49
line basically they call it as End of Line wherein they do all the last quality check so since Apple controls
7:05:55
that document they are only asking uh you go and do the productionize but the quality check is also
7:06:02
is controlled by all those quality documents which Apple will do the sign off with foxcon accordingly they are
7:06:08
ensuring that the quality is maintained and it is very much common you know most
7:06:13
of the people they don't do the manufacturing by thems because there are people who will do who is focusing on
7:06:19
the manufacturing and there is Prime Focus is uh on doing the manufacturing
7:06:25
at lesser and low lesser cost so that's where you know apple and all other guys they decide to Outsource the
7:06:31
manufacturing to somebody else but they don't compromise on the quality All Quality checks are been properly
7:06:38
documented they are properly othered and uh if
7:06:43
any violence any basically uh mistake what foxc does they will be severely
7:06:49
penalized from Apple side so all those uh not only about quality I think you should have the question about IP
7:06:55
related things also so there are proper they call it as what is that uh ind's
7:07:00
non-disclosure agreement ments are been signed off between you know those parties so it is expected that foxcon
7:07:06
will not use uh those designs for some other Productions and if if they found
7:07:12
guilty they will be heavily P but essentially this is the concept
7:07:17
scale that's why you know they next Saturday finish there are two
7:07:24
tops related to Value Effectiveness uh modu is measuring the value so how to how you as a product
Measuring Value Delivery Effectiveness
7:07:31
manager you have to measure whether what kind of value Effectiveness is there for you uh refers to assessing how well the
7:07:39
company delivers the promised value to the customer ensuring that the product or or exceed the customer expectation
7:07:46
and create uh Satisfaction by measuring Effectiveness companies G insights into
7:07:52
how successfully they meet customer needs and retain customers and differentiate themselves in the market
7:07:58
so that's the effectiveness how well the value is been delivered value is created how well value is delivered and
7:08:04
accordingly how well value is pursued by the customer so how to assess it so typically we go for kpis
7:08:11
so product management is all about kpis so you have different different kpis we are going to learn lot of kpis in
7:08:17
product analytics you know there are customer Centric kpis there are business Centric kpis there are Finance Centric
7:08:22
kpis but in know in this uh topic of this model we are trying to understand
7:08:28
the kpi with reference to Value delivery so just uh there are 1 2 3 4 I think
7:08:34
five kpas are there first one is customer satisfaction uh it called as a CET measures the degree of satisfaction with
7:08:40
a specific interaction or the product or service overall often uh collected
7:08:46
through the service after purchase of or service experience so you will ask customers to rate your uh product in the
7:08:53
scale of 1 to 10 and accordingly you get a lot of sample data and that basically Define what is your C4 you similarly
7:09:01
have NPS score net promoter score it will gauge the customer loyalty by asking How likely customer
7:09:08
are uh recommend the company to others so higher NPS is higher Pur value so are
7:09:15
you recommending this product to somebody else so that that kind of questions are captured in net promoter
7:09:21
school as a promoter are you willing to are you are you going are you going to become a promoter for this product so
7:09:27
that kind of questions you will ask and you'll capture NPS so detailed formulas how to capture NPS how to capture cat we
7:09:33
are going to learn in um product analytics but just these are the overview how to how you how are you
7:09:39
going to assess the value delivery creation customer retention rate indicates how effectively the customers
7:09:46
company retains the customers High retention typically means customer feels the uh the product delivery delivers the
7:09:54
value over time you know you have retention rate you have active users you have you know the users number of users
7:10:01
who have loss from your platform and accordingly you are going to calculate the churn rate you are going to calculate the
7:10:06
retention rate in terms of percentage value and basically this is another kpi to decide the pursued value by the End
7:10:14
customer uh you have another kpi called as a customer lifetime value measures the total revenue of a company can
7:10:21
expect from customer or entire relationship showing the financial impact of the effective value delivery
7:10:28
so if you go to traditional value and if you calculate is kpi so that means the price of a product So In traditional you
7:10:34
know uh methodology of value delivery traditional versus contemporary what we have I think understood the side by side
7:10:41
comparison in traditional value you sell the product I think that's what that's that end of the relationship between
7:10:47
yourself and customer but in basically if you go to SAS based kind of model wherein you are going for subscription
7:10:53
based model the clv customer lifetime value here you are calculating for One customer what is the expected revenue
7:11:00
from that customer number to the company for entire relationship you know
7:11:06
so that's what you are trying to gauge it and accordingly you you have this kpi so that also will tell basically uh what
7:11:15
is the effectiveness of your value delivery you have some more metrics product or service usage metrics track
7:11:20
how often and in what ways customer use the product or service indicating its
7:11:25
relevance and value in customers daily lives uh you have some more KPS like a
7:11:32
first Contact resolution customer effect score effort score customer service
7:11:37
index these metrics helps SS efficiency and ease with which customer issues are
7:11:42
resolved so these are specifically service related uh matrices so when did you launch the complaint how are you
7:11:49
satisfied with your first response how long typically it takes for the customer to get the issue resol so all those kpas
7:11:56
are there and this is another way to check whether the value delivery is or Not So kpi based me
7:12:04
method gather customer feedback and insights customer feedback service use service feedbacks forms interviews
7:12:10
gather qualitative and quantitative insights on the customer experiences pinpoints expectations customer reviews
7:12:16
and ratings monitor reviews you know you have platform like a Google uh Yelp I honestly I did not Ed
7:12:25
help or trust pilot I typically go for Google reviews understand how customers
7:12:31
feel about the product or service social listening track social medias for customer comments typically comments are
7:12:39
available in Twitter mostly negative comments are available on the Twitter you can able to check uh what kind
7:12:46
of negative comments are there and accordingly you can goge whether the value delivery is effective or
7:12:52
not complaints prises customer advisory boards and focus group engage key
7:12:57
customers on early adopters in structured feedback back sessions to understand perception of the value and
7:13:04
areas of improvement so these are different different uh Ways by which you are checking uh how customer is
7:13:10
perceiving your product how customer is perceiving the value what it delivered to him and accordingly uh you you have
7:13:17
you can able to justify whether it is on track or whether it needs whe there are some gaps and whether it needs further
7:13:24
Improvement this is the about measuring effective delivery once you have the
7:13:30
data you know you the operational data know delivery and fulfillment times measure how efficiently products and
7:13:36
services are delivered it comes to basically the operations related side
7:13:41
quick and reliable delivery reflect positively on the value perception support response time as we discussed
7:13:46
during customer support how quickly are responding to customer queries quality matrices measured defect rates how many
7:13:54
times defects have been reported product has been reported uh returned there were warranty claims there is a warranty per
7:14:01
how many times product has came back because it had violated all warranty
7:14:06
norms and there was some quality issue high quality products within fewer with fewer issues directly contribute to
7:14:12
pursued value usage analytics you know typically you use Google analytics you
7:14:18
check for software products you check how customers are using those particular
7:14:24
features uh for digital products track the user engagement feature adoption and drop off points to understand which
7:14:31
which part of the product deliver most value which is the commonly used feature which are the features are not been are
7:14:37
rarely being used so accordingly you can see you can basically segregate the value delivery by each of those features
7:14:43
and accordingly you can optimize those features which are not been widely
7:14:49
used uh measuring competitive repositioning uh market share customer
7:14:56
acquisition rate so this is related to growth Market you know you are measuring a growth market share and high
7:15:02
acquisition rate signals the customer recognize the value you know your Revenue growth is increasing quarter on
7:15:08
quarter uh so that is strong indicator that you are on track uh price comparison pursued value
7:15:16
versus competition competitors evaluate whether customer perceive your product as offering better value at the similar
7:15:24
or higher price to than that of a competitors so if you have you know the similar
7:15:31
the product from the competitor which is priced at similar you know price points then you have to check with customer
7:15:37
which product they are giving for which they're feeling they're basically feeling that that product is adding
7:15:43
more so compare it with Benchmark your product essentially that means calculate Financial impact of value delivery uh
7:15:51
Revenue growth and profit margins increase Revenue growth and improved profit margins indicate that effective
7:15:58
value delivery translates to financial success that's what I was uh I think customer acquisition cost versus
7:16:04
customer lifetime value ratio a CSC
7:16:10
relative to C that effent value delivery since uh returned and satisfied customer
7:16:17
brings more like so the ratio of customer acquisition cost versus
7:16:22
customer lifetime value how much revenue is generated by the customer so you know how much money you
7:16:30
spent in order to acquire the customer you have the information about how much revenue is generated by a particular
7:16:36
customer over its lifetime of that product and you create that you know ratio and that is
7:16:43
additional you know kpis to check uh what kind of value you are delivering is
7:16:48
it effective or not you can also check repeat purchase how many times customer has repeated the
7:16:55
purchase uh High repeat purchase rate reflect strong value delivery as customer return
7:17:01
when they feel that product or service meets their needs uh set benchmarks and continuously
7:17:07
monitor performance uh as we discussed you know set internal benchmarks for each of the metric for
7:17:14
example uh support response time you have threshold value or expect close the
7:17:19
ticket in 3 days accordingly you have some thresholds and accordingly you can check uh what are those cases for which
7:17:27
you have not made that threshold and what is the area of improvement continuously Improvement cycle use the
7:17:33
feedback and to implement product or service improvements refine processes adapt the
7:17:39
value proposition to evolve example process for measuring
7:17:46
value delivery Effectiveness collect the Baseline data for customer satisfaction and operational matri matrices gather
7:17:53
the qualitative insights from customer feedback social uh listening to understand customer
7:18:00
sentiment monitor repeat purchase rates customer retention rates monthly quarterly using
7:18:05
the data to identify the trends conduct quarterly review of matrics I would say it is not happening quarterly typically
7:18:12
you end up reviewing those matrices once in a month at least you know when you have launched the product recently
7:18:19
comparing them into both internal benchmarks and competitor data and accordingly you can make a Bas on the
7:18:25
findings adjust the strategies improve the response time product quality customer support
7:18:31
you can go for future enhancement so this is how you are ensuring that the value is effective effectively value is
7:18:38
been delivered to the end and this is about measuring the value effective okay so next improving
Improving Value Delivery Process
7:18:46
the value delivery process uh continuation of that topic uh
7:18:51
understanding the customer needs and expectations I think this point is very common across all the points at the end
7:18:57
it boils down to go back to customer and try to understand their expectations via surveys interviews and all those
7:19:03
things this is very very common point in alls optimize
7:19:08
operating identify and eliminate bottlenecks in production Logistics and delivery so which slows down the overall
7:19:16
process uh Implement Lan processes Automation in areas where it improve
7:19:23
speeds or enhances uh heavily invest in quality control I think that's let's go back to
7:19:29
the point wherein we we discuss in about Apple has given the manufacturing to foxcon which is which in basically they
7:19:36
are doing the manufacturing in China so they heavily invest in quality control ensure that consistent product or Serv
7:19:43
by implementing quality assurance practices in production or Service delivery typically they go for if you
7:19:49
heard the term Six Sigma other quality improvement methodologies just in time
7:19:54
Lin manufacturing all those things you are going to utilize in order to ensure that quality you are manufact in the
7:20:01
quality product with uh enhance customer communication and transparency keep customer informed
7:20:07
about each stage of the delivery process from order confirmation to delivery
7:20:13
basically tracking function it will build the trust manage expectations use
7:20:19
digital tools like SMS or email notification I think now generation we are going for Android based application
7:20:24
which talks about uh the each small step okay product order is accepted order is
7:20:31
packaged order is delivered order is in commute order will be delivered tomorrow
7:20:37
so all those notifications it will build the trust and transparency uh leverage technology for
7:20:43
process improvements use data analytics customer Rel CRM kind of tools to identify the patterns and optimize the
7:20:51
interactions Implement digital platforms or apps that makes it easier for customers to interact with uh asss
7:20:59
Services Market make purchases use nowadays you know everything is
7:21:06
you're going to use artificial AI technology in all the processes which will reduce a lot
7:21:12
of so all those kpis and all it is expected that these are ready and you'll
7:21:18
get a good dashboard report of all those kpis Empower Frontline employees train
7:21:24
employees to provide excellent customer service Empower them issues on the spot to improve customer experience encourage
7:21:32
culture of customer centricity by aligning employee goals with customer satisfaction metrices I think if you see
7:21:38
you go to any customer service call you know if that customer service person if he has helped you he will tell okay can
7:21:45
you please rate Me So based on that rating his salaries will get
7:21:51
incentivized so accordingly you are aligning the employee goals with customer satisfaction metrics so like
7:21:57
that you are incentivizing them and also you you as a product manager you have to make sure that a right information is
7:22:04
provided adequate information is provided to customer support team so that they can solve the problem in
7:22:09
quickest manner Monitor and improve after sales support provide easy access
7:22:15
to after sales support and encourage feedback to address issues quickly often
7:22:21
you know offer warranty return loyalty programs to slow to show customer that
7:22:27
the business values their satisfaction make sure that you know you create a
7:22:33
image that they are important their feedback isant and even after the purchase
7:22:38
continuously measure and refine you know I think this is this point is also very much consistent in all our most of our
7:22:45
slides uh be flexible learn from your mistakes learn from the experience and
7:22:50
accordingly improve the processes track the kpis related to Value delivery such as customer satisfaction NPS repeat
7:22:58
purchase regularly review this performance data identify where the adjustment needs to be made areas of
7:23:03
improvement and accordingly improve it I think one example what we gave for example an e-commerce business improving
7:23:10
the value delivery process might have they might have used the data analytics to predict the demand and optimize the
7:23:17
inventory management so basically you are trying to reduce the inventory handling cost by using Advanced Technologies you have historical data
7:23:24
because you know e-commerce company it is expected that during Diwali season you are expected to get higher demand so
7:23:29
you have historic IAL data now you are going to use that data in order to finalize the what kind of inventory you
7:23:36
would like to uh store and accordingly you are optimizing the inventory
7:23:41
management in order to reduce the oper operational costs partnering partnering with reliable Logistics provides to
7:23:48
ensure fast hour and ontime delivery again let's go back to whether you would like to delivery function you would like
7:23:53
to keep within your organization or you would like to Outsource it to some other agency so there you know you have to
7:23:59
make a decision as we discussed make versus buy what kind of value this function is adding to the customer and
7:24:06
do you have any players in the market who can do this job better than you so if you have answers for these two
7:24:12
questions accordingly you can decide want to do this function within the organization or whether you would like
7:24:18
offer personalized post purchase support and easy return options enhancing overall customer experience are the
7:24:25
things you should do for improving the beyond the time let's right thank you okay thank you have a nice just a quick
