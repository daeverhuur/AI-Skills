Gemini is without a doubt one of the most powerful AI chatbots that has ever been created. But while some people are
0:06
getting incredible results with it, others are just left underwhelmed. And the difference really comes down to how
0:12
well you understand and use Gemini. Today, I'm going to give you a full walkthrough of Gemini, showing you not
0:19
only how to use all of its features, but how to get set up the right way to get the most out of it. We'll start by
Accessing Gemini
0:25
accessing Gemini on the web by coming to gemini.google.com. Now, of course, Gemini is a Google
0:30
service. So, as long as you are signed in on this browser to any of your Google services like Gmail or Calendar, you'll
0:37
automatically be signed in on your Gemini account as well. And you can see that over here on the top right. If
0:43
you're not signed in, go ahead and do that because you want to to get the most out of Gemini. Now, before we actually
0:49
start talking about how to use this or any of the settings, let's first talk about the different pricing plans. You
Pricing Plans
0:54
can see those by clicking right here where it says upgrade. And here you'll see that Gemini has four different pricing plans. Free, plus, pro, and
1:02
ultra. Ultra is really for those 1% of super users, so that's probably not going to apply to you. So, you can
1:08
ignore that one. Now, I suggest you start on the free plan, of course, and then slowly move up as your needs
1:14
increase. Most people are going to be fine on the free plan for a while. And I think a lot of people are also going to
1:20
land on the pro plan, which I think personally has the most value out of it for the price that you're paying. For
1:25
most of this video, I'm going to be showing you how to set up and use Gemini on a free plan. Anytime you see this
1:30
white background, that means I'm on my free Gemini account. Anytime you see this black background, though, that is
1:36
my pro account. And I'm going to switch between the two because there are some features that are not available on the
1:41
free plan that are available on the pro plan. But let's start on a free Gemini account. Before we start using Gemini,
Settings Setup
1:49
let's go ahead and dive into the settings to get it set up the right way. So, click on this gear icon on the
1:54
bottom left. That will open up the settings menu. There are a lot of choices here. I'm only going to show you the ones that actually matter. And that
Custom Instructions
2:01
starts with this one right here called instructions for Gemini. In here, you will find eventually two different
2:07
things. First, your custom instructions for Gemini. And second, anything that you want Gemini to learn and remember
2:14
about you. So, we're going to start out by actually setting up some custom instructions. And you can do that right
2:20
here by clicking on add. And this is how you can tell Gemini what you want it to
2:26
remember and how you want it to interact with you. So for example, you can say
2:31
things like, I prefer detailed answers with lots of examples and analogies. If
2:36
I submit that, you'll see that that then appears right here as a custom instruction for Gemini. The more
2:43
information that you're able to put in here, the better it's actually going to be at helping you because it's going to
2:49
know what your style is and different things about you. So, you can get quite elaborate with this. You can also add
2:54
things about yourself. You can tell it your career, any dietary restrictions. I also tell it what devices I use, like an
3:01
iPhone and a MacBook, so that if I'm troubleshooting some issue, it knows exactly how to hone in on like what the
3:08
issue is, and it's not trying to like fix a problem on Windows when I don't even have a Windows computer. So, I'll
3:13
go ahead and submit those ones as well. Now, jumping over to my Pro plan, this is a little bit different on Pro because
Personal Intelligence
3:20
we now have this new thing called personal intelligence. and personal intelligence actually groups together
3:26
the instructions for Gemini along with a couple of other features as well. The
3:32
first one is past Gemini chats. So I would definitely toggle this on. This will allow Gemini to pull information
3:39
and search past chats to give you more relevant responses. We also have those
3:44
same instructions down here. Instructions for Gemini. So opening this up, you see the same thing in here, but
3:50
you can toggle this on or off. And then finally, we have connected apps in here. So in here you have the ability to
3:57
connect your different apps like Gmail, Docs, Google Keep, Google Drive, Google Calendar, your YouTube search services.
4:03
So anytime you use Google search, Google Photos, even YouTube music and a bunch of other or a few other ones as well
4:09
down here. And so basically what this new personal intelligence does is that it will connect on its own all this
4:17
different information. Information from your past chats, information from your connected apps, information from your
4:23
instructions, and it's able to connect the dots between all of those a lot better than you're going to get on the
4:30
free plan. So personal intelligence is incredible. It works really well. So if you have it, I highly recommend that you
4:36
do turn it on just the way that I showed you. Now, coming back to the free account, there is a connected app
Connected Apps
4:42
section right here, but it doesn't use personal intelligence, but it still works really well. And for the same
4:48
reasons, I would go ahead and turn these on because now you with these turned on, you can actually ask Gemini to find
4:55
information from your Gmail or your calendar or your drive. It's not going to work as well as personal
5:01
intelligence, but it works pretty well. So, I would go ahead and turn all of those on. And as far as the settings go,
5:07
that is all you have to worry about. You don't have to dive in there really ever again because in the future, if you ever
5:13
want Gemini to remember something about you, you can just tell it. So, I can say to it, remember that I have two dogs and
5:19
no cats. You can see is now storing that personal information. And it was now saved to my info page. But clicking on
5:27
that, you can see that it now added a new one here that says I have two dogs and no cats. Now, navigating on Gemini
Navigation
5:33
is very easy. At any point if you want to return back to the homepage, all you have to do is click on the top left here
5:39
where it says Gemini. Over here on the left is the menu. You want to go ahead and click these three lines that will
5:45
expand it. Clicking it again will collapse it. So, if I go ahead and open it, you'll notice that there's a button
5:50
right here that starts a new chat. So, if you already have a chat that's open and you want a new one, just click right
5:57
here where it says new chat. You can also click right here where it says temporary chat. You can sort of think of
Temporary Chat
6:02
this as incognito mode. When you use a temporary chat, it's not going to show up in your recent chats. If you're on
6:10
the paid subscriptions and you have personal intelligence, this anything you type in here will not be used in the
6:16
future for your personal intelligence either. In addition to that, nothing you type into a temporary chat will be used
6:22
to train its models. Unlike other chat bots like Chat GBT or Claude or
6:28
Perplexity, you cannot really opt out of model training inside of Gemini. There
6:35
is a way to do it, but if you opt out of model training, then it doesn't actually
6:40
save your chats, which is extremely annoying, and you obviously want your chats to be saved so you can reference
6:47
them in the future. So, it really nerfs the entire Gemini experience if you opt out of model training. But if there's
6:54
anything a little bit more private that you don't want to be used inside of the model training, that's when you would
6:59
want to use a temporary chat. Now, moving along here on the left menu, the next thing down is my stuff. You're not
My Stuff
7:06
going to have anything in here right now, but as you begin to create images or different documents or different
7:12
projects, you're going to see those show up right here. These are not your chats. These are the things that you've made
7:18
with your chat. Below that are gems. We will talk about those later. And then you'll see all of your chats right here
Chat History
7:25
from your past history. For any of them, you can click on these three dots and pin them up here at the top. Or you can
7:33
click on those three dots and unpin them. You can also rename any chats, delete chats, or share any
7:39
conversations. And then finally, up here is a search tool. So you can actually search your
7:44
chats. But let's actually start using Gemini now. So obviously this is a chatbot. So by coming into the box right
Using Gemini
7:52
here, you can ask it any questions that you want or have it help you collaborate on anything that you need. So for
7:58
instance, I can ask it to help me write an email. I can start a new chat. I can ask it what are the best hikes around a
8:05
certain area. Right? So basically anything that you can Google or anything you would ask another chatbot like chat
8:11
GBT, you can also use Gemini for. Now coming back to a new chat. I want to show you all these settings down here
8:17
because this is really how you get Gemini to be more powerful. So first of all, there is a microphone button. This
Microphone Input
8:23
is extremely helpful. If you use this, you no longer have to type in here. Things will go much faster. So by
8:29
clicking on this, it might ask you for permission first. There we go. And I'll click on allow while visiting this site.
8:34
So it will always work. And now I can just use the microphone to type, what are the best ways to have Gemini help me
8:40
with managing my Gmail inbox? And personally, this is my preferred way of interacting with Gemini just because I
8:47
can talk a lot faster than I can type. Now, moving along here on the left, you'll notice this drop down right here.
Model Selection
8:54
This shows you all the different models. We have fast, we have thinking, and we have pro. Now, Pro is really only used
9:01
for advanced math and coding. Most people aren't really going to get a lot of use out of that, so you should really
9:08
just stick with fast and thinking. Now on a free plan you will get unlimited access to fast and limited access to
9:15
thinking. On a paid plan you get a lot more access to thinking and a lot more access to pro. Now personally every time
9:23
that I'm using Gemini because I am using it on a paid account I leave it on thinking to get the best results
9:30
possible but the fast results are still really good and obviously you do get those answers a lot faster. And just to
9:37
show you a comparison, when I have it on fast, this is how quickly you get an answer
9:43
pretty quickly. And this is the type of answer that you get. And with thinking enabled, you will notice that it will
9:50
take a little bit longer. This really depends on the prompt. This is a pretty simple one, so I don't think it's going to take too long, but if it was a much
9:56
more elaborate prompt, it would take a lot longer. But you'll notice here that that did take a few more seconds. still
10:03
pretty fast, which is the reason why I leave it on, but you get a better result with it. So, if you're on the free plan,
10:10
I would stick with fast for most questions or most prompts. But if you
10:15
have something that requires a little bit more information that you need or it's more important, I would switch it
10:20
to thinking. I just wouldn't leave it on there all the time or you will hit a limit on it. Now, moving along to the
Tools Overview
10:26
left, we have some tools here. So clicking on tools, the first one is called deep research. Now on the free
Deep Research
10:33
plan, you can use deep research only a few times per month, but on the paid plans, you do get a lot more usage out
10:39
of those, a lot more times that you can use them. Deep Research really creates these very dense, elaborate reports, and
10:45
it takes several minutes for them to generate. For instance, here's what one of the reports looks like. You can see
10:51
it is quite long and quite dense. Includes things like these different charts here. It includes things like
10:58
graphs, different things like that. But for most people and most prompts, I think this is a bit overkill. This is
11:05
really very dense material. You can see the writing here is very technical. It says the global automative automotive
11:12
sector stands at a critical juncture undergoing a fundamental transformation from internal combustion engine
11:18
dominance to electrified propulsion. So I think for most people this is really overkill unless you have like a real
11:25
academic need or like a need for your business to have these very detailed
11:30
reports. So given that I will turn that off. Coming back into tools you can also
11:35
create images with this. Now you can click tools and click on create images but it's really not necessary if you
11:41
want to create an image. All you have to do is say create an image and then tell it what you want and it'll actually be
11:47
able to create that image for you without you having to select create images inside the tools.
Canvas
11:53
The next tool is called canvas. Canvas I think is way underutilized. I really
11:59
love it. And by turning this on what it does is it it creates for you an interactive environment where you can
12:06
work with Gemini on a project. This is really good for coding. It's really good for any type of writing as well. So, for
12:12
instance, if we turn back to my other example where I asked Gemini to help me write an email, you can see that it
12:18
created the email here in the chat. But if I'm going back and forth with Gemini on changes to this, that gets a little
12:25
bit confusing because then I have to keep scrolling up and back down. It's a lot easier to go ahead and turn on
12:31
canvas. So, I'm going to copy down this prompt. At any point, you can come to any message that you sent and click
12:37
right here where it says copy prompt. And I'll go ahead and open up a new chat. I'm going to go ahead and paste
12:43
that in. But this time, I'm going to turn on canvas. And you'll see how different it looks. And for this one, I'll also turn on thinking. So, you see
12:50
this side section popped up and we have the email in here. So, now what I can do
12:55
is if there's something I don't like in here, I can actually change it right in here. And I can even highlight a section
13:01
and say what changes I want Gemini to make to it. So I'll highlight this first sentence and say I want to be a lot
13:08
firmer here. And you can see she just updated now or it just updated now that one sentence. If you don't like any
13:15
changes, you can go ahead and click on previous version. That will then go back. If I decided that was wrong, I can
13:21
go back to the next version. Of course, we have formatting things up here as well, like bolding, italicizing,
13:27
different things like that. If you're happy with this, you can go ahead and click on share and export and actually
13:32
copy the contents. You can export it to your Google Docs and there's a share button here where you actually get a
13:39
link to share it as well. There's also this create button right here. So, what this does is that this will turn this
13:46
content into different content. So, the first one is a web page. If I go ahead
13:52
and click on that, it will actually create a web page from this material. You can also create infographics,
13:58
quizzes, flashcards, and audio overviews. So, this is really helpful for when like you're studying. So, let's
Study Guides
14:04
go ahead and do that. I'm going to come back to a new chat. I'm going to ask it to create a study guide for learning
14:09
German. Just like before, under tools, I'm going to turn on canvas. And for the model, for this one, I'm going to turn
14:16
on thinking. Now, when I submit this, you'll see that on the right, it's creating the entire German study guide
14:22
for me. But, of course, this is just text. And for a lot of people, this isn't the optimal way of learning. A lot
14:28
of you are visual learners. So, what I'm going to do is on the top right here under create, I'm going to ask it to
14:34
turn it into an infographic. Just by clicking that, you now see on the left that is getting to work and creating an
14:41
image, an infographic based on all the information that it put together for us here. Here's what it now came up with.
14:48
You can see that infographic here on the right. Now, if you want to make any changes to this, all you have to do is
14:54
click right here where it says select and ask. We'll go ahead and highlight like this text up here and say change
15:02
the title, make it friendlier, for instance. And there it just updated the
15:09
title to something that is literally more friendly. Once you're happy with something like this, you can of course
15:14
share it or copy the contents. Now, one downside of creating infographics inside
Infographics
15:19
of here is that if you click at the copy button, all you're actually copying is the code. So, it's actually pretty
15:25
difficult to download the actual image, which is a drawback of creating infographics inside of canvas. So, if
15:33
you're going to make an infographic that you want to share, I really recommend you do that in the normal chat without
15:39
canvas turned on. So, I came in here, I started a new chat. Again, you can always start a new chat by clicking on
15:45
the left here where it says new chat, even if the menu bar is collapsed. And
15:51
this time, I'm not going to turn on canvas. I'm just going to ask it to create an infographic about the topic
15:56
that I'm interested in. Then, using the image generation tool, it will create that infographic for you. And you can
16:03
then download that as an image. Now, I want to navigate back now to my canvas
16:09
where I was working on learning German. So to do that, I'll click on the menu bar on the left here to expand it. And
16:16
I'll find that chat in the side here. I think it was this one right here. And
16:22
now we're back and we have the canvas open again. Now, when you start using Canvas, you'll notice that as you start
16:28
to generate more assets like maybe an audio overview or some more files or infographics, the chat can get quite
16:35
cluttered and you kind of have to scroll around if you want to return to the original document that we made. So to
Files in Chat
16:41
fix that, they added this button up here on the top right called files in this chat. By clicking on that, you're going
16:48
to see everything that you created in this chat. So we first have that German study guide, which was the text, and
16:54
then we also have the infographic that was made. This button also shows up in regular chats as well. So if we come
17:00
over to this one that I did a few days ago, you notice that I have a lot of images in this chat. And by clicking on
17:07
the files in chat button, you'll see all those images here. I think I could honestly make an entire video dedicated
17:13
to just Canvas and all the things that you can do with it. But I think it's time to move on. But if that would
17:19
interest you, let me know in the comments section down below and I'll make an entirely separate video just on Canvas. But let me now show you guided
Guided Learning
17:25
learning. This is pretty cool. This is really helpful if you're a student. So this is where you want to type in
17:31
anything that you're looking to learn. So maybe you're studying for the bar exam and you can type in I'm studying
17:37
for the bar exam. Help me learn contract law for New York. Now I'm going to switch this to fast because as you see
17:43
down here, I've hit the thinking limit on the free plan. So I'll no longer be able to use thinking until it resets in
17:50
a few hours. And here it begins to talk with you almost as if it's a tutor. It
17:55
talks about what it's like to study for the bar exam and how you should go about it. Then ask you some questions. What is
18:01
it that you want to study? So, I want to study contact uh contract formation. So, I'll type in one. It then introduces the
18:08
concept to me, the key concepts from it. And then it asks me a question to make sure that I understand it. So, it's
18:15
going to be all this sort of back and forth. Again, it almost acts like a tutor. The final tool here inside my
Visual Layout
18:21
free plan is called visual layout. Now, this is a labs feature. It's not going to be available to everyone, but it is
18:28
available on some accounts. Basically, what this does is it gives you answers,
18:33
but it creates a more visual answer. So, for example, I might ask it, what are
18:38
the most popular dogs in the United States? And you see, it's not just giving a text answer. It's actually
18:44
giving this entire visual layout where it shows the top dog up here, literally
18:50
little blurb about it, an image of it. Here are the other breeds down here, and you can scroll through this. This is
18:56
like a carousel, some more stuff down here, and it even references YouTube
19:01
videos, and then sort of like some follow-up questions that you can give it. Compare that to the normal results,
19:07
the same exact question where it's completely textbased. You do get sometimes charts like this or like I
19:13
showed you before when I asked for hikes, it did produce a map as well, but this obviously is a lot more visually
19:19
appealing. This does take a little bit longer to load. So, personally, I rarely
19:25
use this. I usually go with it off. And if there's like a very specific reason
19:30
why I want a visual layout, then I would turn it on. Pro tip, if at any point you submit a prompt and you realize you
19:36
entered it incorrectly or you didn't quite get the results that you wanted, instead of starting a new chat, you can
19:43
just scroll up to the question you asked and edit that prompt. So, here I originally asked, "What are the most
19:49
popular dogs in the United States?" And then I said, "What about in Europe?" But I meant to ask Asia. So I can just change this to Asia. Click on update and
19:56
then it will give me a new answer based on that prompt that was edited. Just
20:01
know that you can only ever edit the last prompt in a chat. If I scroll up to the original one, there's no way for me
20:08
to edit it. So those are all the tools that are available on the free plan. There's one additional one on the pro
Create Videos
20:15
plan, which is create videos. Again, you don't actually have to expressly press
20:20
this button. You can just tell it create a video and tell it what you want the video about and it will make it for you.
20:26
There are also some additional tools that are available on the ultra plan, but I'm not going to cover those in this video. The last thing here inside the
Add Files
20:32
chatbot is add files. So, you can upload files, things like images, you can upload screenshots, PDFs, word
20:40
documents. You can also add anything you have inside your Google Drive. You can add anything from your photos. And you
20:47
can attach any Notebook LM notebooks. If you're not familiar with notebook LM,
Notebook LM
20:52
you can easily access it by clicking on the settings down here and click on notebook LM. And this is a place where
20:58
you can organize different categories of items. So you can create a new notebook for every topic that you're interested
21:04
in. In this account, I only have two, but in my other account, I literally have dozens and dozens of different notebooks on different topics that I'm
21:10
interested in. Not going to dive in depth into how to use Notebook LM, but just know that inside of here, you can
21:16
store all these different sources. And then inside of Gemini, you can actually
21:21
click on notebook LM, click on that notebook, and then it'll be able to pull in all the information from that
21:27
notebook. So, a really good workflow is to use Notebook LM to organize and store
21:33
different information inside these different notebooks. And then to be able to interact with them, one way you can
21:38
do it is by adding it inside of here. And then you could say something like, "Create a training guide to help me do a
21:44
one-armed pull-up." It's going to pull information from this notebook to do that. I could even for this one maybe
21:50
turn on canvas. That way we can kind of really dial this in to get the exact results you want. And there we go. Now,
21:57
I'm about to show you one of the most powerful features inside of Gemini. But before we do that, if you've made it this far in the video and you got some
22:04
value out of it so far, do me a quick favor. Give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel. I'm constantly releasing tutorials just like this on
22:10
some of the best AI tools out there. So, if you don't want to miss out on that, make sure you subscribe. One of the most powerful features of Gemini are their
Gems
22:18
gems. You can find these over here on the left where it says gems. Now, there are two types of gems. We're going to
22:24
start with the basic ones that you make yourself. So, you want to scroll down to where it says my gems and click on new
22:31
gem. Now, what these are used for, well, there's a few use cases for them, but one of the first use cases of them is,
22:38
let's say you find yourself coming into the chat every day or every week and giving it the same instructions every
22:44
single time. Maybe it's helping you write emails and you always want them formatted in a certain way. So, you just
22:49
keep writing out the same instructions over and over and over again. Well, instead of doing that, you can set up a
22:55
gem. So, coming back in here to a new gem, we'll give this one a name. We'll
23:00
call it email helper. You can then describe what this email helper does.
23:06
This is just basically internal. The name and the description doesn't actually change what the gem does. It's
23:13
just for your reference. So, I'll say here helps me with emails. Now, here is where you can put in your custom
23:19
instructions. These are going to apply to every chat that you do inside this gem. So, the more detailed this is, the
23:27
better the results are going to be. So, if you just say something simple like help me with my emails, it's not super
23:34
useful. So, you really want to elaborate on this. Now, if you're getting stuck on that, there's this button right here. If
23:40
you go ahead and click on this, that will automatically take your very short prompt and expand it. You then want to
23:46
go through and actually edit the new prompt that was created or the new instructions that were created. Make
23:52
sure they're exactly the way that you want. Great. So, I went ahead and did that. And now I'm ready to move on to
23:57
the next setting, which are the default tools. So, we've already covered all these different tools. So, you want to
24:02
make sure you turn on any of ones that you actually want to be used every time
24:07
you chat with the chat inside this gem. So, in this case, because we're working on emails, I actually do want to turn on
24:14
the canvas so that every time I have it write an email for me, that email will show up in the canvas. And finally, you
24:21
can also upload knowledge into your gem as well. This is the other very useful situation when you want to use gems
24:29
because this will allow you to actually upload a knowledge into this gem that will always be there every time you
24:35
enter this gem. So you don't have to continually come in here and and upload the same files over and over again. So
24:41
just like before with the regular chat, you can upload files, Google Drive, photos, or notebook LM research
24:47
material. For instance, let's say you work for a company that has a standard operating procedure for how they want
24:54
their emails written. And they actually give you a downloadable PDF on what that entire guide is. You could upload that
25:01
file into here so that that can then become part of this knowledge base. Or alternatively, let's say you do customer
25:08
service and you work for a SAS company. You might get a lot of questions about how to use the software where you can
25:15
upload all the documentation on how to use the software, all the different help guides. So that will then be able to
25:22
easily answer those questions for you. Once you're happy with the settings, you can test the gem over here on the right.
25:28
So for instance, I'll throw an email in here. Go ahead and submit it. And we can see the answer right here. It activated
25:34
the canvas. And then here is the email that it wrote out for me. So if I'm happy with this, I can just click on
25:39
save and be done with it. But let's say I look at this and I notice that they do this bullet list or this this list of uh
25:45
different items that are numbered and I don't like that. Well, then I can come over here into the instructions and say
25:52
something like never use numbered lists and then click on and then click away
25:58
and that will then load it. And so now if I ask it the same question, it won't
26:03
use a numbered list. Once you have it completely the way that you like, go ahead and click on save. Now, anytime I
26:10
have an email, I can just come over here to the gems, click on the email helper,
26:15
paste in that email, and my gem will start working on that email using the custom instructions from the gem and
26:22
using all the tools that I told it to use, which in this case is the canvas. If you ever need to edit your gem, just
26:28
come over here on the left where the gem is, click on these three dots, and click on edit. You could also pin a gem so
26:35
that it will stay here. Because if you notice on this account, I actually have so many gems that all of them don't
26:42
appear over here on the left. I think you could only see five of them and it'll show the most recent one. So, if
26:48
you want to make sure that one of them never disappears, just go ahead and pin it. You could also delete them at any
26:54
time. You can access them again by clicking on gems and scrolling down to where all your gems are located. So,
27:01
those are my gems, but you may also have access to this feature up here called
Gems from Labs
27:07
gems made by labs. Again, this is a more experimental feature, so it's not going
27:12
to be available on all the accounts, but it is available for me on this free account. And what these basically are
27:19
are little apps that you can make inside of Gemini. So, here's an example of one
27:25
of them. It's an app that takes an image of different food items and then identifies what those ingredients are
27:30
and then suggests a recipe based on those ingredients. And you can see all the steps of this gem over here on the
27:38
left. Now you can go ahead and click start and actually use this as an app.
27:44
But the real important thing here is that you can make these little apps yourself. So coming back again to gems,
27:50
go ahead and click on new gem here if it's available to you and you can start designing your AI mini app. So here I'll
27:56
ask it to create a task management app specifically for YouTubers. And in less than a minute, this app is now ready to
28:03
go. I can go ahead and click and start and actually try it out. And what's unique about these apps is that it
28:08
actually uses Gemini AI to power them. So they're not dumb apps, they're AI
28:15
powered apps. And as you're testing this out, if there's something you don't like about it, you can just come over here on
28:21
the left and actually ask Gemini to edit the app to make it exactly the way that you want. This is another one of those
28:27
tools that I could honestly spend an entire video talking about because there's so many things that you can do
28:33
with these gems from Labs. Let's now talk about some more advanced features.
Image Editing
28:39
Now, I've gone ahead and switched over to my pro account because we're going to do some image editing. You could
28:45
definitely do this on the free account, but like I said before, I hit the thinking limit on my free plan. And when
28:50
it comes to any type of image generation or image editing, it does help to do
28:56
that with thinking turned on. You're going to get better results. So, I'm going to go ahead and upload an image of
29:01
myself by going to upload files. And then I'll tell it to turn this into a professional LinkedIn ready profile
29:08
photo. Now, you don't have to click on create image. It's going to be smart enough to realize that what I'm asking it to do is to edit this image. I'll
29:15
have thinking turned on and click on submit. And there we go. Now we have a LinkedIn ready profile image. Another
Image to Video
29:22
thing I want to show you is image to video. Again, this is only going to be available on the paid plans because
29:28
video generation is only available on the paid plans. One tip when it comes to creating videos is because you are so
29:35
limited in the number of videos that you can create, it really helps to first create the image that you want to be for
29:42
the video. So for instance, I wanted a video of a dog skydiving. Instead of
29:48
actually asking it to create the video first, I had to create the image first. So once I'm happy with the image, I'll
29:54
go ahead and click on copy. I'll then go ahead and start a new chat and paste
29:59
that in. For the tools, I will turn on create videos and just tell it use this as a start frame for a video. And then
30:06
here's what it made for us.
30:13
Pretty good. But as you see right here, I can now only generate two more videos today. Be aware of these popups because
30:19
like I said, there are limits on things like video generation. A few other things I want to show you here on the
Using Connected Apps
30:26
web. So, when we first set things up, I showed you how you can connect your apps. To actually use that, all you have
30:32
to do is inside of a chat reference them. So, I can say something like, "When are we going to LA? Check my
30:39
Gmail." Because I know I've received an email talking about the dates that I'm actually going to be in Los Angeles.
30:45
Here you can see it's actually now connecting to my Gmail. And here you can see it tried. It wasn't successful. It
30:52
saw that it had a trip to Fort Lauderdale back in 2018. It wasn't able to find the upcoming trip to LA. But
30:59
what you will notice is that if you are on the paid plan, which has that personal intelligence, it will be
31:05
better. So that same question here, you probably will get the right response. The final thing I want to show you,
Scheduled Actions
31:10
which is only available on the paid plans, are these scheduled actions. These are extremely helpful. If you go
31:16
ahead and click on this, this will allow you to schedule out recurring tasks. So,
31:22
let's say every day you want Gemini to scan for certain news on a certain
31:27
topic. You can just come over to a chat and tell it something like, "Every day
31:33
at 6:00 a.m. Mountain Standard Time, look for the latest AI news from the past 24 hours." And you can see it is
31:39
now scheduled that out for me. So, coming back over here to scheduled actions, you can see that that now
31:45
appears right here. If I ever want to change it, I can just click on the pencil icon or I can toggle it off if I
31:51
don't want to get those anymore. But if you have it turned on, then every time it runs, you'll get a notification about
31:57
it in the mobile app on your phone. Speaking of which, let's jump over to
Mobile App
32:03
that. Now, the experience on mobile is going to be very similar to the experience that you get on the web app.
32:09
Obviously, having it on your phone is a lot more convenient. So, you can access it from anywhere. But there are also
32:14
three additional things in here that really stand out. So, first of all, there's a camera. So, if you ever need
32:20
to know what something is, you can just go ahead and open that up, take a picture of it, just go ahead and send it
32:26
and ask, "What is this?" This is also really helpful for translations. If you're traveling somewhere and it's in a
32:33
different language, like all the different signs, it will actually be able to translate those signs for you as well. Second thing is on this tool menu.
32:41
If you have a pro plan and you have access to videos, there is this new
32:47
template section right here that you can use as templates for your videos, which is kind of fun. But again, you are very
32:53
limited on the number of videos that you can create. But the standout feature
Live Chat
32:58
here is this button right here. This allows you in real time to chat with Gemini. This is extremely helpful when
33:06
you're driving, when you're just out for a walk. A lot of times, like while I'm cooking, I'll just leave this and start
33:12
talking with Gemini, learning about a new subject. So, let me show you how it works. I'll click on this. Tell me about
33:17
that guy, Alex, who likes to free solo mountain climb. Alex Honold is a professional adventure
33:24
rock climber famous for his audacious free soloism. What has he climbed?
33:29
He's climbed quite a bit. Besides El Capitan, he's known for numerous significant ascents, including half
33:36
domes. Reg. Now, another really cool thing that you can do with this is that, let's go ahead
33:42
and turn this on, is that you can at any time actually activate the camera as well. So, I'll go ahead and turn on the
33:49
camera. What is this and what can I use it for?
33:55
That's an Allen wrench, also known as a hex key. You can use it to turn and tighten or loosen.
34:02
And then once you end the chat, you'll see all of the stuff you talked about in here. It's absolutely one of my favorite
34:08
features. And I just love how I can just kind of set this aside, just be chatting
34:13
with it, and learn these new topics when I'm driving, when I'm walking, when I'm cooking. It's incredibly useful. So,
Outro
34:20
there you have it. That's Gemini. Hopefully now you understand how to use this the right way so that you can get
34:25
the best results out of it instead of just throwing questions at it and hoping for a good response. Now, right here is
34:32
a video that covers another tool that I absolutely love called Notebook LM. And what I love about that tool is that it's
34:37
not only incredibly powerful, but it's also free. If you want to learn about how it works, click on this video right
34:43
here, and I'll see you over there in just one second. Bye for now.

oday I'm going to show you how to use Google's entire ecosystem for AI to
0:05
build and automate almost anything in your business. Happy Christmas people. This is a full onehour course. We're
0:12
going live to test all the new updates. Google was recently dropped. We're going to be covering for example Google AI Studio, Notebook LM, Google Stitch,
0:19
Google Flows. We've also got Gemini directly in the chat here with some cool new features. And all of this you can
0:26
use for free. All of this works right now. By the end of the stream, you'll know exactly how to use each one. So,
0:31
you know, whether you want to save 10 hours a week, get more leads, or just stop feeling behind on AI, this is the
0:37
video for you, my friends. And if you have questions as you go along, feel free to ask. Let's get straight into it.
Exploring Gemini's Features
0:44
So, you can see we've got Gemini over here. Now, if you're not familiar with Gemini, if you never really use it, then
0:49
basically you can switch between the tools here. So for example, you got deep research, you got great videos, great images, canvas, guided learning, deep
0:56
think, and dynamic view, right? Actually, one thing that most people don't know about is dynamic view. So if we say, okay, plan a trip to Japan, you
1:03
can create some pretty amazing outputs, right? And what it's instantly going to do is create a mini app. And that just
1:08
gets you a quick win because now you know how to build your own apps and tools in literally one click. And a
1:14
feature that 99% of people actually don't know about. All right. So, you can see how quick and easy this is to use.
1:22
And now this is beginning to code out a dynamic views tool on labs. So, you can
1:29
use this tool for basically almost anything you want. If you want to automate, for example, tools, apps, if you have a website to build, etc., you
1:36
can do it all inside here directly. All right. Now, whilst we're planning this out, I want to show you something else.
Building and Automating with AI Studio
1:41
So, over here on the right hand side, we're going to open up AI Studio. That's available at astudio.google.com.
1:46
You can actually get all the video notes for free directly from the AI success lab that connects you with 40,000 other
1:52
AI entrepreneurs inside this community. If you go to the classroom here, we got a bunch of cool stuff as you can see.
1:58
And if you go to December 2025, you can see we've got the full course on Gemini
2:03
and how to build anything, right? So, if you want to get all the video notes, it's right there. Aladun says, "Love
2:09
you, bro. Love you too, mate. Thank you very much, sir, for tuning in today." And we're going to keep going through.
2:14
Now, this is one way to use Gemini. Another way that we can actually use this and this is probably my favorite
Creating Personalized Recommendations with Gemini
2:19
way is you can go on to something like Claude and Claude will actually give you some cool ideas or chat GPD or whatever
2:25
AI you use the most and that will give you some personalized stuff that you can actually build with Gemini right so if
2:30
we're like okay how can I or what's the one thing I can create today with Google
2:38
Gemini that would help me the most and because it understands you understands
2:43
who you are understands what you do It's got a lot of context about what are the biggest problems you need to solve right
2:49
and that could be personal that could be health related that could be business related but the main thing here is that
2:55
you can use this process to just generate better outputs right on the poll does yeah we'll call yes means
3:01
Gemini and no means chat GPT I know what you mean so you can see here it's given us a bunch of ideas and it's actually
3:09
this is really interesting so it says given your primary constraint is brand awareness the highest level thing you could do today with Gemini is create
3:15
like a hook bank. So, how would we do this? What we can actually do is we could say analyze these video intros and
3:23
titles that perform the best and then what I'm going to do is take my most popular video. So, just to recap here,
3:29
basically it said you need to get more attention. So, how do you get more attention? You create a hook bank. What is a hook bank? It's basically looking
3:35
at all of the different hooks you've created previously in the past with your content that's most popular. And then
3:40
you can use a prompt like this and it's automated the prompts and gives us like a copy and paste swipe that we can then take from YouTube. Right? So you can see
3:47
how you can get personalized recommendations based on what you need to improve and it's so quick and easy.
3:53
Right? And then what we can do is we can actually take all the latest video titles from our channel like this. We
3:58
can copy those in. We can go back to Gemini. We can paste these in. Right? So I'm going to say video titles below.
4:05
Right? And I don't really need to format that because it's an LLM. So, we'll figure out, okay, this is title and this
4:11
is not the title, right? And then hopefully anyway. So, then we're going to plug this in. As you can see now,
4:18
it's going to generate 50 new hooks based on the existing content. So, I'm going to hit enter. So, we can switch
4:24
here. This is something to note as well. It's like you can switch between Gemini 3 fast, Gemini thinking, or pro. Right
4:31
now, thinking takes ages. So, it's using something called Google Deep Think, which is super powerful, but also very
4:36
slow. You can use fast or you can use pro. I'm just going to go with fast because it's a lot it's a lot of data to
4:41
process and also I want to live stream with you but if you want to create like better stuff you can. All right so now
4:47
we're beginning to code this out bro by anti-gravity can we create app or SAS
4:52
after creating if there any bug how can we fix it without knowing code? If you have like bugs in any tool that you
4:58
create you just want to screenshot the bug that you find plug it into anti-gravity or any other tool and just
5:04
say fix this. That's usually how you fix it. And then you go back and forth and wrestle with it a little bit until you finally figure it out. That's the way
5:10
that I would recommend it. So you can see here it's analyzed the psychological patterns, right? And how to create some
5:18
awesome ones. And then it's given us a bunch of new ideas that we could
5:23
actually use for our potential content, right? So for example, here we got a bunch of ideas for YouTube titles that
5:30
we could create. Let's just split test some of them. Right? But you can see how easy that is. And now we've got a hook bank and we're ready to go, right? I'm
5:36
actually going to talk about that. It's super useful and you can see how easy this is, right? To build stuff out like
5:41
this. This is probably the highest impact, the most impactful thing I could do today. And I just automated it in 5
5:47
minutes whilst talking to you, right? That's how easy it is. If you go back to Gemini here, we've already for example
5:54
created the trip itinerary tool in one prompt by saying plan a trip to Japan.
6:01
That was pretty cool, right? You see here, we can just click through. Pretty amazing. You can see that we can click
6:07
through and this kind of like a an interactive app that we just built in one click, but it's personalized to us,
6:12
right? Pretty nice. And then you switch between destinations, the calculator,
6:17
the practical tips, etc. Pretty amazing. Love it. So now what do we do? So now
6:24
what we're going to do is we will go back over here. Let's say I need to redesign my whole website. Maybe that's
Redesigning Websites with AI
6:30
something that we need to focus on, right? So, I'm going to go over to julian.com.
6:35
I'm going to take the HTML from this page. Then I'm going to go over to and I
6:40
don't know if this is going to fully handle the context, but we'll try. We'll give it if it doesn't. If it's too big, then we can do it another way. And then
6:46
we can switch over to canvas here. And we can say, okay, redesign my website to
6:53
make it more beautiful and interesting. Right now, again, if that's too much
6:58
context, no problem at all. Is this on YouTube? Yes, it is on YouTube. If you want to watch on YouTube, just go to my
7:04
channel here and then if you go up to the top, you go to live. You'll see me
7:09
live streaming as you can see. So, yeah, you can watch on YouTube. So, let's have a look. Now, we got Gemini redesigning
7:17
the whole website as you can see. And literally, you can redesign a whole website in one click. Right now, it
7:23
might not be amazing, you know, but you can always go back and forth if you need to change things. So, that's how quick and easy this is to do as well. And now
7:30
it's created a more beautiful version of my website as an example of this. So let's share this out. Right? So we'll copy this. We'll create the sharable
7:37
link. You can share this with your team or whoever you want to share with and just blow creating a nice new website here. And you can see here, for example,
7:44
this is the new website we created. Now, like I was saying before, if you want to fix bugs, for example, like Aton, you
7:50
were saying you were struggling to fix some bugs inside your content, right? You just screenshot that, go over to
7:55
Gemini, and just say fix this. Right? That's basically how you do it. And then you can see here we've got all the
8:02
content from the page. Pretty simple and easy. And that looks a lot better than my existing website. I'll tell you that.
8:08
Right. So if we have a look at my existing website, this is the one, right? And it's old now to be honest
8:13
with you. Like it's due a bit of a revamp. Right? Whereas for example, if we go back to Gemini now, we can see the
8:20
page. Look how much nicer that looks. Look how much more modern that works. Right? And also you can see here it's
8:25
taken the existing testimonials from our page but it's just re-witting the content. So it's like voices of victory.
8:31
Page one rank is out of myth. They're result of the goldie agency system and we've basically redesigned our website
8:37
in one click. Pretty nice. So just to recap what have we done so far? We actually created a full app in one click
Generating Marketing Copy and Hooks
8:42
using plan a trip to Japan, right? We redesigned a whole website by just copying and pasting the content inside
8:47
there. Pretty amazing, right? We also took the one thing that would have the
8:53
most impact on our business. So, we're not getting shiny object syndrome. We're not getting confused and all that, right? We're just taking one thing and
8:59
going, "Okay, I need to focus on that. That's the one thing that I need to do this week. I'm not going to get distracted." Um, we've taken that from
9:06
here, plugged it into Gemini, and then we created the hook generator, right?
9:12
And so, it's pretty amazing what you can do here. Let's pull this up. Yeah, here's the hooks. Right now, if you just
9:20
want to steal this stuff from me, do you know what I'm going to do for you? I'm going to go into the AI success lab, which is completely free for you. You
9:26
can connect with like 40,000 different AI entrepreneurs. So, it's pretty amazing inside there. And then what I'm
9:31
going to do is I'm going to take the resources from today, as you can see. And then if you want to, for example,
9:37
take a look at what I've done, how I've done it, etc., you can do all of that inside here. All right. So, let's just
9:44
grab this one. We'll share this conversation and number one this is called to check out but number two it
9:49
gives you inspiration you can see how I've done this stuff right so we're going to copy that and we'll go over here right then we will copy this
9:57
conversation for the website design and we'll go over here what else we got we
10:03
got the AI hooks and we'll copy that all right so everything that I'm creating
10:08
today I've shared with you get access to the free resources and as we continue to build today we've Got a lot more to go,
10:15
a lot more to show you. This is going to be awesome for you. All right, so let's keep going through now. And we've built
10:22
an app, we built a website, we built the marketing copy for our YouTube
10:27
campaigns. What we're going to do next, right? So, what we can actually do here as well is we can switch over to canvas,
Building Mini Apps with Canvas
10:37
right? And then we can create like mini apps that are customized with tools that
10:42
have AI built into them. Okay, so let me show you an example of that. So if we go inside Claude and be like, okay, what's
10:49
one single simple mini app I can build today, that would help me massively. And
10:55
again, the reason that I use like Claude or Chat GPT or these other tools to come up with it is because they're trained on
11:00
a lot more personal data from me, right? I've used them a lot more than Gemini. And that's simply because Claude is really good for writing, which is a lot
11:07
of what I do all day, right? And so if you take the personal recommendations
11:12
from these other tools and then plug them into Gemini, that's the best way to get outputs, right? That's the best way to get results here. So you can see
11:19
here, for example, it's okay, an AI stack recommended quiz, right? So we're
11:26
going to take that and now we're going to say, okay, give me a prompt to build this. All right? And so we get the idea
11:33
and then we get the prompt. And the prompt will just be like something copy and paste. We can just plug straight into this bad boy. Here we go. All
11:40
right. So now we got that. And now what we're going to do is we're going to go over to canvas inside Gemini. Copy and
11:46
paste our prompt. You can tweak it before you publish, but I'm I just want to make it really easy and I want to show you how easy it is so you can get
11:52
some quick wins and then you can go off and start building this. All right. Now let's talk about the old way and the new
The Old Way vs. The New Way of Using AI Tools
11:59
way. All right. So waiting for that to load. But I want to talk you through, okay, what's the old way and the new way, right? The old way was like you
12:05
would use 10 different AI tools that don't talk to each other, right? And that would be like the old way of doing things. Now, what you can do is you can
12:12
use Google's connected ecosystem where everything works together, right? Because you got video, you got images,
12:18
you got links to Google Drive, you can link to Gmail, and everything else inside Gemini as well. The old way was
12:24
paying for expensive AI subscriptions every month. the new ways you can use free Google tools that do 80% of what
12:31
paid tools do right so even for example if you run out of credits on Gemini no problem mate what you can do is just go
12:37
over to AI Studio AI Studio is free to use as well right and that way you just get the most of everything and if you
12:42
have any questions or you want to see me build something whilst we're live and we got a few people watching today then
12:48
just feel free to ask like I'm happy to help so whatever you want me to do just
12:53
let me know all right so we're beginning to build this out now as you can see and so if we go to Gemini. We've got this
12:59
tool built out quiz and what's your perfect AI stack questions and I'll tell you exactly which AI tools you should be
13:05
using business start discovery and then we can switch between these tools right and so for example I'm going to say okay
13:11
I'm in ecom admin blah blah blah we're just going to click through these randomly and then they have to enter
13:19
their email address the access to the stack it's going to analyze the business and now it's given us a bunch of
13:25
recommendations and tools we can use Right. And so we've created this quiz. So it works really well and it can generate leads for us and then it
13:31
actually sends traffic to the air bottle as well. Okay. Obviously you would make sure it has the right URL to use. But
13:38
basically you can funnel traffic with a quiz to the pages that that you need to
13:43
funnel traffic to. Really simple and easy. Did you do a video on conductor? That's only for CI. Yeah, you can use
13:50
you if you check out my channel. I've got a video on conductor. So you can get that if you there. All right. So let's
13:57
go back to the notes for today. Now the old way as well was spending hours
14:02
learning each tool that comes out. Whereas with Gemini, you can master two three core tools really deeply and the
14:08
old way was like hiring developers to build apps and automations. You don't need to do that anymore, right? You just grab what you want and play English AI
14:15
build way was like manually creating presentation research content. New way
14:21
you upload this book is just like and it could create everything. We'll come on to notebook 11 minute and then the old
14:27
way was like entering leads manually or missing communities. New way is like you can have voice agents to qualify leads
14:34
247 right so I'll come on to chat bots and how to build those out in a minute what you do in the meantime is we're
Automating with Notebook and Chatbots
14:40
going to check out now is powered by Google. All right so if you want to test
14:46
this out you just go to notebookm.google and then you're going to go inside here try notebook etc. And from here you can
14:54
start building out, right? So for example, what we can do is we can load up a new notebook. And I know someone
15:00
asking about an image. We'll test this out. We're going to go over to my YouTube channel and we're going to find
15:06
on Gemini conduct. We'll copy that. And then we're going to go back to plug in the tools. Paste that URL. Insert that.
15:14
And now you can see here is it's going to use that as a custom source inside our which is great. Now we have a custom
15:22
AI automation that understands exactly what we want because it's context
15:29
if you use just like Jack something like that doesn't have any context of what you want right it doesn't understand
15:35
what you're talking about it's not going to be super relevant to whereas for example if you want to learn about
15:40
Gemini conductor and you train you on information about Gemini conductor then you're going to get much more relevant
15:46
better output right on the right hand side here as well what you can see is you can You automate audio view, video
15:52
views, mind maps, reports, flash cards, quizzes, infographics, slide, data tables. Pretty insane. If you have a
15:58
look at data, you see here for example, it's created this table. It's like here's the command or feature of this
16:04
tool like Gemini conductor. And then here's a description, primary function, generated file types, developers, etc.
16:12
Right? How easy was that to do? It's just by a couple of clicks. Now, if you want to see some examples of this in
16:17
real time, here's an example. Right? So you can see here we've plugged in our sales training SAP. Right? Now this is
16:26
very powerful because now I can train my team automatically and I don't need to answer their questions. Right? This is
16:31
basically a chatbot that answers their questions whenever they have them. So instead of them going onto Discord and
16:36
asking me a question, they can go into this chat and ask a question which means that I don't need to be online. I don't
16:42
need to dedicate my time to pace training, right? Saves a lot of time. So for example here we can say okay how
16:50
should I handle the objection of I've already an SEO agency right and
16:58
basically this is going to scan the resources and come up with some ideas to fix that right so for example if I have a sales team member who's on a sales
17:03
call with client comes to him and they're like I've already got an SEO agency I don't need an SEO agency right
17:09
and then they can actually use this chatbot to get ideas on how to handle it
17:15
right So for example, it's like most agencies and it's hard work, right? This
17:20
is where we win. Here's the example they could handle the agency, the objection. So you do the extension, right? Do the
17:26
specialist P. You could do the reality check, right? You could do the white label. So for example, you know the
17:32
reality check, right? If their agency is not good, why are they talking you? Find the gap. Ask them how is that working
17:38
for you? Pull up a check the domain rate, etc. Right? and just create and just that shows you exactly how to train
17:45
your team to handle stuff, right? On the right hand side, we've got a bunch of stuff. For example, we got a video here
17:50
and this video was fully automated with no actually has a narrator over the top,
17:55
but you can see how easy it is to automate videos, right? It's like a powerful media center that you can use
18:04
to generate these outputs. We've got another one here. So, we got audio overview infographic. As you can see
18:10
this infographic fully automated with nano banana Gemini with game changer and
18:15
then if we keep scrolling down here we have for example the presentation as
18:20
well right so this is presentation it was fully automated with notebook right
18:26
so what's really amazing about Google and Gemini is like the whole ecosystem so for example today app
18:35
slideshow presentations videos we talked about for example how train your team and automate that. How to create custom
18:41
chat bots, custom training on your data and your information. You learn how to create infographics, slide decks,
18:48
flashcards, quizzes, and it's all in the space of what 20 so far. Power of this
18:54
just unbelievable. It's absolutely unbelievable. Now, if you go back to Gemini as well, you can also automate
18:59
videos inside there, right? You can use Ve3 for this. So if we go inside here on
19:04
tools create videos and you use to generate videos right skateboarding
19:10
right generate video the only problem is that this is going to be like 8 seconds long whereas for example if you go
19:16
inside notebook and you automate video inside there you know it's going to be much right so if you actually go into
19:22
this video right here you can see that this is now 7 minutes 21. It's a lot longer and you get a lot more out of it.
19:29
Squeeze more out of notebook in terms of like compos. Okay. Now, as we're going through this,
19:37
let's just recap on what we're doing. All right. So, we talked about the old way and the new way. But some people as
19:43
well will say, "I'm not technical enough to use this stuff." Most people think like you need coding skills to use. Yeah, that's the old story. But here's
19:49
the truth. Every story I'm showing you today, you just write in what you want. There's no technical skills required. Describe what you want. AI built in. If
19:56
you're using something like Google Anti-gravity, you just say build me a website that shows my services and it writes all the code. For example,
20:13
whereas these new tools are designed for curricular people, right? So, if you've never used the ditch before as well,
Designing with Stitch and AI Studio
20:19
this is pretty powerful. This tool that you can actually use designing, right? and it's powered by Gemini 3 Pro. Okay,
20:26
so you can switch between the APIs here. Now, Google Gemini Fast. This is like
20:32
the fastest version of Gemini's latest models. It's really powerful. It's actually pretty good for UI as well. The
20:38
other cool thing about this is you get quicker outputs. 2.5 I wouldn't worry about the old model. Thinking with Pro,
20:45
that's better. And then redesign is quite interesting as well. So I have existing apps or sites with another pro.
20:51
You just attach a screen right. So speech is a free tool and you can use it
20:56
to redesign. So if we for example wanted to redesign this page so screenshot as
21:02
you can see go back to speech now with that screenshot and then inside here and
21:08
say okay redesign this. Yeah. And you can give a direction this to be more
21:14
interesting. Yeah. This is beginning to build out an awesome design. Now we
21:20
duplicate this tab. We go out here. So whilst this is redesigning, let me show you some other example. You want to go
21:26
to projects here. And you can see for example, this is a mobile and a desktop
21:31
version page we recreated, right? And what we actually did was say design a
21:36
more beautiful website for it. It looks more interesting. And we just touch this picture, right? And then it created from
21:43
this to this, right? And this looks a lot nicer, a lot more interesting. You
21:48
can also generate like variations, regenerate, get the coded version, get predictive heat map, which is cool. If
21:54
we click on regenerate, we can add that, right? As you can see, so if we click on
21:59
regenerate, now actually generate more variations on the left hand side. And then we can also annotate it, right? So
22:07
for example here you click on we'll have to wait for that to load because it's regenerated now but you can actually
22:13
annotate get straight into it as well. So that's pretty cool too. So Stitch it
22:19
doesn't create the website itself but you can export that to something called AI studio which we'll come on to in a minute. You can see we got the option to
22:25
export right there. Now we have the new version of the website. So this is the old version. This is the new version.
22:31
Right. Which one looks better? Obviously this one, right? It's a lot more modern. Looks more interesting.
22:36
It created a much nicer version. Also, it's focused on mobile first. Now, if you go over here as well, we can
22:42
annotate this and we can say okay, let's take that and we can draw, right? And
22:48
then if you actually apply that based on those drawings, you can actually edit the image and the UI itself, right?
22:56
Which is pretty cool. So, it's beginning to adjust the spacing and everything else. And from one single website
23:02
screenshot, we can now create a full-blown website that's actually going to look a lot nicer. Right? So, even
23:07
redesigned the thumbnail, which is cool. I like that. It looks better than my thumbnail. Right? Look at that. And that which one looks better? This one for
23:13
sure. And then we've got a new option over here. Right? So, it's beginning to code out a new option. Now, if you have
23:19
an example like this and you're like, okay, I don't know what to do with it. I've got the UI from Google. That's great. It's using a banana. It's created
23:25
a beautiful UI, right? How do you export that? What you can actually do here is you can actually send this over to Jules
23:32
or you can send this over Google jewels is like a coding agent kind of chat codeex. Honestly, if you're not like
23:38
super deep into coding, you don't need to use it. You can actually code that to clipboard. You can take a zip file if
23:44
you want to download it and upload it to Netlify for example. But here's probably the most powerful option, which is that
23:50
you can actually export this to AI Studio and then you can build out not
23:56
just the front end, but the back end, right? So, if we say, okay, make this real, what it's going to do is take the existing designs from Stitch for free
24:03
and build them inside AI Studio, right? Using that screenshot that we've taken. So, if we click on build now, you can
24:09
see how easy and powerful this is, right? And so the whole ecosystem of Gemini is pretty insane because you've
24:16
got Stitch, you've got AI Studio, you've got Gemini directly, you got anti-gravity, which we haven't even
24:21
talked about yet, and you have notebook as well. Now, if we go back to Notebook LM over here, you've got this notebook,
24:28
right? And you've got several notebooks. So, you've got like the notebook for your sales training or a notebook for
24:34
AICO strategies or whatever it is. So, you're creating all these different notebooks. Now, how can you get them to
24:39
talk to each other? you can't get them to communicate with each other inside notebook directly, right? So, for
24:45
example, if you're inside notebook, like you're not going to be able to get the sales SAP training to communicate with
24:51
the AICO strategy section, right? But what you can do is you can go over to Gemini here and we've got the video of
24:57
the cat here, by the way. Let's just let's open this. We got to watch a cat skateboarding for 2 minutes. Pretty
25:03
cool, right? Super easy to use and it's only going to be like 8 seconds long,
25:08
but the quality and everything is really nice. very cinematic. So anyway, if you go to the chat here, what we're going to
25:13
do is we are going to go to add, right? So you click on the plus sign here and then you can actually get your multiple
25:20
notebooks to communicate with each other and leverage all of them, right? So if we take our three notebooks here, we can
25:26
actually get them to talk to each other and then what we can do is we can go to canvas and we can say okay build a
25:33
relevant tool for these notebooks, right? build a relevant I don't know app
25:38
mini app for these notebooks and you can build a website you can build a notebook you can build a mini app you can build
25:44
whatever you want using these directly right by the way if you have any questions if I miss anything out if I'm
25:50
not filling in the gaps etc feel free to ask as we go along this is how you can use these tools to generate almost
25:56
anything that you want you know to build anything that you want websites apps videos
26:02
we haven't even come on to how you can use the images inside this as well. But
26:07
you see here, for example, we've got the mini app built from the notebook. It's
26:12
actually got a checklist that we can use for the discovery section and then the objection section, right? They can
26:18
takeick off the packages, the conductor, etc. So, it's pretty amazing. Now, inside Gemini as well, what we can also
26:25
do is create images or create tools, etc. And this is powered by nano banana.
26:30
So if we click on for example create images over here this is going to leverage images via nano banana to
26:37
generate or edit existing images. Now we can just go inside here and create a basic image. We're creating a lot of cat
26:44
pictures today and we'll go with create a cat snowboarding right but what we can actually do and I'll do this in a
26:49
separate tab whilst we're waiting is we can start a new chat here. We can create another image and then inside this we
26:56
can upload a file right. So, if I wanted to upload, say, a thumbnail, which I've done right here, and I'm going to change
27:02
this to insane. So, let's say I wanted to just edit a word inside the thumbnail
27:07
itself. I can change this bit here to that word, right? And it'll be super simple and easy to do. So, if you need
27:14
to create like multiple variations of a Facebook ads creative, maybe you need to create a variation of a thumbnail, maybe
27:20
you just want to mess around with this stuff and create multiple versions, look how easy that is, right? It's taken exactly the same image, but it's edited
27:27
out the content right there. This is by far and away the best image generator on the internet that I've ever seen. Right?
27:33
I spent thousands of hours testing AI, but this is by far the best. You can also, for example, say, okay, invert the
27:40
colors. And what that helps you do is just create like a variation of the same thumbnail, the same image that you can
27:46
test again. So, if you like want to test multiple versions of an image, maybe you need to create a lot of content or a lot
27:51
of volume, etc., then you can easily do it just by inverting the colors, right? And so if you have a winner, but you
27:57
don't want to mess around, you can create one like that. That's actually turned me into I look like a smurf inside that image. So I wouldn't go with
28:04
that, but you know how you could do it, right? You know how easy it is to edit images and that sort of thing. So if you
28:10
go back to here, you've got the image generated by Gemini as well. It's pretty simple and easy. And we've also got the
28:18
new content from Stitch over here. We're going to close this available at stitch.withgoogle.com.
28:25
And then if we go back to AI Studio, what we actually did was we recreated that landing page that Stitch designed,
28:31
right? And so you can take images and turn them into real coded projects without actually coding using this
28:37
method. So for example, here we've got the new design. We went over to AI Studio. We exported it and boom,
28:44
shakalaka. There we go. Right, we've got the full page here. So that's pretty
28:49
amazing. Now, this is a whole different rabbit hole, but if we go over to AI Studio now, as you can see, we've got
Exploring Google AI Studio
28:55
Google AI studio here. Now, you can actually use the playground and you can play around with the API, use this as a
29:01
chatbot. You can also generate images. You can use pro preview inside here. You can use flash preview and you can switch
29:08
between the APIs on top. Right? So, for example, pro preview, flash preview, right? This is the image generator. This
29:15
is their best model for thinking. We've got for example flash which is a great model for just getting faster outputs.
29:21
It's still creating relevant outputs that are actually good right and then
29:27
you got image gem which is like that old I've not used that recently. I don't think that's the best one. I think nana
29:32
banana is best for generating images as you can see. And you can also switch between different options right. So for
29:38
example, even over here you actually got Gemini flash live, you got image, you
29:43
got VO2 which is their API for generating videos and then we've also got the audio over here as well. So we
29:50
can switch between audio, video, live, images, Gemini, featured etc. Okay, so
29:56
that's kind of like the main chat here. Now if you actually want to build something, which is usually what I use
Building AI Apps with AI Studio
30:02
it for, then you can build all sorts of crazy apps. Let me show you some examples. So, if we go to AI Studio
30:07
here, these are a bunch of apps I've built and literally they were so easy to build and I'll show you a bunch of them,
30:15
show you how they work, show you what you can do, etc. But it's pretty amazing. And basically, any app that you
30:21
want to build, I'd recommend trying to go with AI Studio. Now, action priority says, can you help me in creating an AI
Creating an AI Chatbot
30:28
chatbot for my website using Google AI studio and chat? Sure. All right, let's try and build this. Right. So, I've
30:35
actually got an example one over here. Right. I'm going to show you. This is a chatbot that I built previously. And if
30:41
you let me know what chatbot you want to build, action priority, then we can build that for you live today just to
30:46
help you out. But if we have a look at this particular example, so this is AI studio logo concept AI, right? And said,
30:53
hello, I'm your logo AI assistant. Let's create something iconic. What's your business name? So, I'm just going to type this in, right? And you can see
31:00
here, this is a chatbot that's actually listening to me, looking at my answers, and we built it just using this prompt,
31:05
right? This is the prompt. So, we said, "You are a logo concept generator. Your job is to help users create professional
31:11
logo concepts using AI image generation tools. The workflow, here we go. Here's
31:17
how it works. Vary each prompt by doing this and then refinement." Right? So basically it's a custom chatbot that
31:23
generates custom logos based on the details that you plug into the chat and
31:29
then once you've generated the chat it will actually generate the logo for you. I'll show you how that works in a second. All right. Great name. What does
31:35
your business actually do? We'll put SEO. Okay. Can you give me three words that describe the brand personality? We'll say we'll just put I don't know
31:42
some random values like hardworking, results focused and leverage. Okay. Do
31:48
you have any preferred colors? I'm going to say my brand colors are and then we'll put brand colors in a second ago.
31:55
There we go. All right. Almost there. Are there any specific symbols or imagery related to your brand? I'm going
32:00
to put SEO related imagery. Okay. And now it's generating the brand brief and
32:06
concepts. So what that's doing is basically generating some ideas for the logo that we can then use to automate
32:12
the logo later. Right. So we got this chatbot over here. As you can see, it's
32:17
generated the design strategy and prompts using the chatbot on the left hand side. So, we got chatbot prompts
32:23
for generating the logos. And then what we can actually do is we can click generate concepts to see three unique AI
32:31
generated logo concepts based on our business profile. And again, how did I build this? Literally just this one
32:36
simple prompt up here. It just onehotted it, right? It created that prompt and that tool in a couple of clicks using
32:43
this process. So, we're going to click on generate now, and that will start creating magic as you can see. And now
32:49
we've got three different logos that we can actually start using for our business, right? So, for example, like
32:54
this one. Pretty nice. And it's used our brand colors. It's created the logos really quickly. It used the concepts
33:01
that were generated from the chat on the left hand side. And there you go, my
33:06
friends. So, that's how easy it is to use this stuff. Right now, what if you actually wanted to for example like host
Deploying and Embedding AI Apps
33:12
this onto your website? You can share the app like this or what you can actually do is you can go into the chat
33:18
here and say, "Okay, how to embed this to my website." All right. So, if you
33:25
want to actually use this inside your website as a custom chat bar and you want to use the tool, you could host
33:30
this as like an actual website itself. So, like a mini website, but you can see here it actually gives you instructions
33:35
on the iframe method, right? So if we deploy this then we can paste the code
33:40
right. So let me show you an example how this works and I'm going to log into my website and show you. In fact I'm
33:47
tempted maybe I can just do it on live stream. All right so we're going to deploy and publish the app as you can
33:54
see. Then we're going to copy the AI studio link here. We go back to the chat
33:59
and plug in the link to the AI studio as you can see. Okay. And now it said copy
34:04
and paste this into your websites builder. See if we can get this working. Never
34:10
actually tested this before, but I think that's how you would do it. So we got the URL here. I don't know if that's
34:15
going to work, but we can certainly try. If you get an error, it's okay. Just go back. I'm just going to take that from
34:21
the page as well. Actually, the HTML's a bit. Yeah, we'll see how to get this working. I think it's good as well for
34:27
you to see like when it doesn't work, just so you can get a feel for like, okay, here's how you fix it, right? Here's how you can fix this bad boy.
34:34
Don't know if it's going to be able to handle all that context, but you see here it's running and coming up with
34:39
ideas. The other good thing about Gemini versus other tools is that not only can it generate like image videos, not only
34:45
does it have all these other different tools to link inside the ecosystem, but also it's got a really long context
34:50
window. It's actually updated the design based on my website, which is pretty cool as well. So, it's rebranded the tool based on the design of my website.
34:58
But yeah, the the cool thing about Gemini is it has a large context window, which means like you can paste a lot of
35:03
content in there and it shouldn't run out. To put this in perspective, like Claude, for example, has a context
35:09
window of 200k tokens, whereas for example with Gemini's got 1 million
35:16
context window. Skully is here. Good to see you, Scully. Legendary member of the live streams. So we're just coding out
35:23
this tool and figuring out how to embed it. mainly use Netify to host it and use the Google Street AI API. But I'm
35:29
getting a lot of errors. So if you get any errors like I'm doing today, just screenshot them and then paste them into the chat and from there you can start
35:36
building this. Also, if you go inside the AR profit boardroom community here, you can actually ask questions and then
35:42
get help, right? So if you're struggling with anything, you can actually get unlimited technical support inside the AR profit boarding post and like
35:49
everyone will help you out, right? So for example like Darren he mentioned about AI studio and then you see
35:54
everyone jumped in here it got 19 comments so it's very active and everyone's just there to support and
36:00
help each other as you can see T-Shark says how to connect full stack website
36:05
with database and login authentication so for that you would use superbase right superbase you can use the MCP
36:11
server or you can just link it directly inside A studio and then with superbase you can actually build full stack apps
36:17
and that sort of thing I also really like data button for this cuz that's how I built for example a job board using
36:24
that and it was really simple and easy to do. Scully says I found the best workflow is like you do floating from
36:29
project to project only what you do knowing you're miles ahead of your competition. Yeah, that's pretty fun as well. Is it normal for chat GPT to
36:36
repeat itself making me do things that I've already done for that specific task? Yes, that's why I don't use chat
36:41
GPT anymore. It's like the outputs are really bad. Like I just I've just wasted
36:47
so much time with Jack GPT particularly after the latest updates. I don't think it's good at all. I actually done a comparison. But in the past the only
36:54
thing that I do chat GPT for is for example for coding is actually really
36:59
good at coding but everything else is pretty bad in comparison to Gemini. For example, we can do this as well. If we
Comparing AI Tools: Gemini vs. ChatGPT
37:04
have a look at for example Gemini and we'll compare the outputs versus Chad GPT, right? And let's say we want to
37:12
generate an image, right? And we'll say, okay, take this thumbnail and make it
37:18
Christmas themed, right? So, we'll do that inside Gemini. And then we'll do the same thing
37:25
inside Chat Gupt as well. This is using Chat Gupty image 1.5, which is the new
37:30
update from Chat GPT. And then we've got Nano Banana inside Google as well. I'm
37:35
actually interested to see how they perform. So, we can add these to split view and just compare them. And you can
37:41
see how much faster Gemini is versus Chat GBT, right? This is an older
37:48
update. This is a newer update. But Chat GBT is just way behind when it comes to this stuff. I just saw Scully's comment.
37:55
Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate you, man. Thank you. Yeah, I like to keep things basic. I like to keep things simple and easy and just minimal. That's
38:02
something actually I learned from people like Horoszi or Sam Ovens. Hormosi when
38:07
he was like really successful was just literally in the basement with no strip on. Right? That's what I think works the
38:13
best sometimes. Just being authentic. So if you have a look here, we've got the images and look at this is the wrong
38:19
dimensions. So you see how this is completely wrong in terms of its dimensions and how it's set up. This is
38:25
a million times better, right? And it was generated faster. Also, if you look at the face itself, see how this is like
38:31
a little bit messy in terms of it almost feels cartoonish with the filter on, right? It applied an automatic filter.
38:38
If we have a look at this image over here on the right hand side, number one, the font is a lot more Christmy. And
38:44
number two, the image itself, the face is like way more realistic. It just it
38:49
feels a little more real. Right now, we can also do another example here. And so
38:55
if we run up a new chat and we'll do this inside Gemini 2 and we can say
39:02
let's try this out. So we're going to say okay canvas and we'll do canvas inside chat she as well. All right,
39:08
we'll compare them side by side. And I'm going to use fast mode inside both of them because I wanted quick answers. And
39:15
we're going to say, okay, build out a beautiful website, but Julian Gold's SEO
39:22
agency, Goldie Agency, just to compare. Okay, which one performs the best? Which one performs faster, etc. But yeah, you
39:29
see here. And Scully says, "The school UI is pretty basic design-wise, but it does the job in space. Yeah, I would
39:35
agree. It's like the apple of communities. Honestly, it's so easy to use. I think Kimmy may be on to
39:40
something. The simplest is sometimes the better it is, right? All things being equal, the simplest solution wins. So,
39:48
we're going to preview that. So, this is the website from Chat GBT, right? And you see how the text doesn't even work.
39:54
It's quite messy. Now, let's have a look at the website from Gemini, right? We're using the fast API for both just to get
40:01
better, faster results. Look at that. It's like it's created content with
40:06
black text on a black background. Like how does that make sense? Whereas if we have a look at the outputs from Gemini,
40:12
you can see over here like it's beautifully designed, it looks really nice, it's all tailored to me and my business. You can read the content, it's
40:19
clean, it's modern, it's unique, it mentions me, like it's just a million times better. And so I think like the
40:25
outputs you're going to get from Gemini in general are usually 10 times better versus for example chat cheap. And so
40:32
that's one of the reasons I stopped using chat GPT. Honestly, yeah, I've shared a bunch of the tools and stuff
40:37
that I built today. We've talked about like the old way versus the new way. Some people going to say, I need to learn every new AI tool. And this is a
40:44
trap, right? So a new tool comes out, you watch five YouTube videos, you sign up, you play with it for a day, then the
40:50
next week, another tool comes out, and you start over. That's not learning. That is distraction, my friends. Okay? So here's a simple rule. Master two to
40:56
three tools deeply. Ignore everything else. I call this the triple stack method because you pick your research tool, pick your content tool, pick your
41:03
automation tool and just get really good at those three. So for example, today we could use Gemini for thinking, notebook
41:09
for research and content AI studio for voice agents and everything else is pretty much noise. Now if you want to build a voice agent inside for example
41:16
AI studio, you go to Google AI studio here and then you can go inside this and you just find the voice agent as you can
41:26
see. All right, let's see what AI powered chatbot. There we go. Conversational voice apps. Right. Love
41:33
when you compare them like this. Yeah, me too. I think it's a lot of fun. Action priority says, "Which is the best AI chatbot to use to get instructions so
41:40
I can finish my chat bot for my website?" Yeah, I would go with Gemini is really good or you can use Claude as
41:45
well. I would just look at Gemini and Claude. And Skully says, "I don't know. Or may have something up to leave. Let's
41:51
see. I I feel like chat is so far behind it's going to be almost impossible to catch up Google. They're just too good.
41:58
So, we got the voice app over here, Gemini Flash Preview. And if we wanted to build, for example, like a voice
42:04
agent, I'm going to say create a voice agent that's a customer service rep for
42:10
new potential clients for my SEO agency, Goldie Agency. Right, we'll hit build.
42:17
And now we can start building out these voice agents as well. All right. So, you can see that's beginning to code out over here. And once that's running, we
42:24
can test out. You can like program it with custom knowledge as well. You can plug in all your you could upload like FAQs and that sort of thing as well
42:31
directly here. But you can see how that's beginning to code out here, right? And it's full screen. Then we
42:36
just have to allow our microphone. Going to start the SEO consultation. It may not work first time around, but let's
42:42
test it out. So, we're going to click on start SEO consultation over here. And let's test this out. Hey, can you hear
42:48
me? So, I need some help with SEO. Ah, wonderful. Tell me a bit about your
42:53
business. What do you do? And what's your website URL? So, my website URL is julianoldie.com.
43:00
And we have a website that sells cat toys. Ah, juliangoldie.com
43:07
specializing in delightful cat toys. That's wonderful. Are you looking for
43:13
more traffic, better conversions, or greater brand awareness through SEO?
43:18
So, we'll end the conversation there. But you can see the voice itself has so much personality. It's super friendly.
43:24
It's way more friendly than most customer service reps that you find. And it replies instantly. Plus, it knows how
43:29
to handle like every response perfectly, right? And so, you can just embed something like this to your website. You
43:34
can easily build it out as you can see. And then what we can also do is just upload custom information about our business over here, right? So let's say
43:42
for example we wanted to upload some information about Goldie agency, who we are, what we do, etc. Right? We can
43:48
easily do that using the method that I'm about to show you. So for example here, we're going to go over to my website as
43:56
you can see and we're going to plug in some information about us, who we are. So we're going to take this information
44:03
right here and plug that in. And then we're going to go over to Google AI Studio and we're going to say, okay,
44:09
here's some company information about me so that you can answer questions better.
44:15
So, you can see here it's beginning to build this out. And basically we plug in the information about who we are, what
44:20
we do, some case studies, some information about us, information about me as a founder of the agency. And you
44:26
could easily just take all the information from your website, copy it, paste into AR studio, and boom, you've
44:32
got custom trained voice agent that knows exactly how to answer everything, right? So if we go inside here, we'll
44:37
say start SEO consultation. Hey, can you help me with SEO? Welcome to Goldie Agency. I'm Goldie.
44:44
We've helped brands scale from zero to 100k plus monthly visitors. How can I
44:49
help you reach those heights today? Tell me a bit about your business, your URL, and whether you're focused on driving
44:55
more traffic. So, you see how easy that is, right? And then you can deploy it. So, you can actually deploy that online. All right.
45:02
So, it's deploying that now to Google Cloud as you can see. So, got the concurge over here, right? Super simple
45:09
and easy. And then if we exit off there, get the sharable link. Copy that. And then you got the code over here. Right
45:16
now, I think what you could also potentially do is actually recode this in HTML. That might make it easier to
45:24
deploy as well. So you could either deploy it like you can see here, we've got this deployed, or you could code it
45:30
into a simple HTML. So you can use AR Studio to build the AI chatbot and then use Gemini to give me the instructions.
45:36
Yeah, exactly. So now we got the code for that. And then you can also host this on a website as well. You also got
45:42
the sharable link and you got the deployed app as well. So if we go over here with the application and then you
45:47
can see the API request here as well as what's cost and everything else. Here's the app URL. All right. And so you can
45:54
actually embed that into your website and then you've also got this embeddible page as well. And then what you can also
46:01
do here is just click on share here. So now it's deployed. Deploy app. So this
46:06
is app URL right? This one right here. Right now, if we go inside here and we say, "Okay, give me the embedible code.
46:14
Here's my app URL." All right. And basically, what we're trying to do here is just get the embedible code that we can put on a website so that we can
46:20
embed this. What are you going to call it? All right. Let's have a look here. Let's come up with some names. We'll use
46:26
Gemini to come up with some actually, do you know what? We'll go over to AI Studio in a sec and we'll grab that in a second. All right. So, we're going to
46:32
grab the I frame and then if we go over to So, this is the HTML, right? All right. So, we've got the HTML with the
46:39
S, the WF, etc. Right. That's the iframe code. Then, if we click on preview, you can see the app ready to be previewed
46:45
right here. So, we can start the SEO consultation. Hey, are you working? Welcome to Goldie Agency.
46:51
Awesome. Can you give me some tips on like how to find SEO keywords? We help brands scale from zero to 100K.
46:59
All right. Can you just give me some ideas on keywords? Just get straight to it. Don't mess around. All right, let's get to it. What kind of
47:05
business are you in? And do you have a URL for me to look at? Yes. Julian.com. We are an SEO agency.
47:12
Got it. So for an SEO agency, we'd want to target keywords around SEO services.
47:18
All right. So you can see how you can embed that now. It's really simple and easy. And all you do, right, just to
47:24
recap on the steps, you build out the app directly inside AR Studio. Then from there, you're going to deploy the app.
47:31
Right? Now, once you've deployed it, you will get an app URL that looks like this, right? So, you don't use the drive
47:37
one, use the app URL, as you can see. Once you got the app URL, you're going to paste it into the chat down here. And
47:44
you would say, give me the embedible HTML code. Here's my app URL. We got the app URL. And then it will give you the
47:51
embedible HTML code, which you can see we plugged into WordPress. So, this is the embedible HTML code. The other
47:57
option that you have is you can create a floating chat bubble style HTML code and
48:03
you just grab this code over here. Right? So, however you want to do it, however you want to embed it on your
48:08
website, that's how you can take these apps directly. Right? When do you decide to put something on the Google Play
48:13
Store? I guess when you got something that you think is amazing and also you just got to test it, right, for bugs and everything else. But yeah, I think it it
48:20
would be quite simple to create new apps for the Play Store and everything else. So, we've talked about how easy this is.
48:26
is I've shown you how easy it is and I've shown you the whole process. Now, let's talk about the Goldie AI automation system. All right? So, I'm
The GOLDIE Framework for AI Automation
48:33
giving you my personal framework for using Google's AI tools together as one system. I call it the GIE framework
48:39
because that's what it helps you build a system that works for you, right? So, this is basically how it works. The
48:45
first thing you got to do is just gather knowledge and research. You can use Notebook LM and Gemini for this. This is where everything starts, right? So, you
48:52
can gather information before you create anything. And notebookm lets you upload the sources and everything else. So it could be for example uploading
48:59
information about SEO agencies if you run SEO agency or I could upload information about my a profitable boardroom and plug it in. Right? Then
49:06
you're going to organize it and you use notebook and Gemini for this too. Right? So you can organize it into my maps,
49:13
flashards, quizzes, reports, tables, etc. Right? And here's a prompt idea you could use as an example. From there
49:19
you're going to learn. Right? So this is L nova collement audio and video views will help you do this. So you can turn
49:25
any research into audio views and video views as I've shown you today. And this is huge for entrepreneurs. You can
49:31
upload a long report, get a 10-minute audio version, and you can listen to that whilst you're out and about. So for
49:36
me, for example, might want audio overviews of each new AI tool update so members can learn on the go. That will
49:42
be a great value ad to the community. And then you've got design, right? Visual UI. And you can use Stitch and
49:48
Notebook LM infographics for doing this. Now most entrepreneurs are great with ideas and terrible with design and now
49:55
you don't need to be a stitch. let you describe an app or web interface that you want to create and it generates it
50:01
and then you can get the HTML and CSS code the Figma and exported files and you're good to go right you can also use
50:08
infographics to turn your research into visual content I is implement start building automating right so you can use
50:14
Google anti-gravity you could use Gemini etc and you can start coding out those tools like I've shown you today a studio
50:21
as well is amazing for this whatever you've built and whatever you learned about you can start building them directly here. And then E is for engage,
50:28
right? So, for example, voice agents interact. You can use Google AI Studio for this, like I've shown you today. And
50:34
this is the one that blows people's minds. But inside AI Studio, you could build a voice agent like I've shown you
50:39
already that answers phone calls or qualifies leads or books appointments or answers FAQs, right? And the crazy part
50:45
is you just describe what you want like I've shown you, right? Literally all I said was create a voice agent that's a
50:51
customer service rep for new potential clients from SEO agency called the agency. That was it. Right? So very
50:58
simple. Now if you want a 30-day action plan, it's inside the A success lab. So it guides you through how to implement this inside 30 days, right? With
51:06
day-to-day actions and homework for each day. Here's some examples of tools you can get. And this is all inside the AI
51:11
success lab. Completely free. connects you with 40,000 entrepreneurs who are interested in AI. And if you go to the
51:18
December 2025 section, you can see here we've got all the information from today. So, the full program from today
51:25
is inside there. I've walked you through the Goldie framework, the 30-day action plan, how you can basically build
51:31
anything you want with AI, plus how to embed it to your website. Clint says, "What happens if you use Google's
51:36
autonomous programming agent to build your back end?" So, you can just be careful how you build it and that sort of thing. test it out properly and also
51:42
think about all the elements of building a good app and then also you know even in the back end like you you want to use
51:48
something like superb base right if you want to code that out and action plan says can you place this example using
51:54
step-by-step instructions this will help me a lot in creating AI chatbot or even a voice agent yeah sure you know what I'll do I'm going to share the app with
52:01
you directly here inside the AI money AI success lab right so you can see it
52:06
right here and basically what you do is prompt test Right, prompt, build it, test it, deploy
52:14
it, right? Get embeddible HTML, then post your site. And using this process,
52:22
if you just rewind the video today, like you can get access to all the steps that we did and how we did it step by step.
52:27
But yeah, it was quite a really good example to use that. And then Scotty says, I wonder if you could create two
52:33
voice agents in one app and have them talk to each other about a particular subject. Yeah, I think you could. I've seen that on YouTube where people put
52:39
two AIs next to each other and they talk to each other and it's it gets weird. It gets pretty crazy. So, thanks so much
Joining the AI Success Lab Community
52:46

he had never heard of NAN and then he came into the course and built his first NA10 agent that saved him 10% of his
54:42
time. Right. Andrew, my first win and he actually automated an AI avatar video.
54:47
And we've got 107 pages of people getting wins with AI like you can see right here. And these are AI profit

Google Gemini 3 just dropped and it's insane. You can build apps with your voice. Automate your entire business.
0:06
Turn videos into full courses in seconds. No code needed. This is the future of AI automation. All right,
0:12
let's talk about Google Gemini 3. This thing is a beast. It's Google's newest AI model and it's the smartest one
0:18
they've ever made. And here's what's crazy. You can use it to build entire apps without writing a single line of
0:24
code. You can automate your marketing workflows. You can turn a 2-hour webinar into a complete online course with
0:30
quizzes and study guides, all with simple prompts, no tech skills required. In this full course, I'm going to show
0:36
you exactly how to do all of that. We're going to cover everything from using Gemini 3 in the app for everyday tasks
0:43
to building no code tools in AI Studio. We'll analyze videos and turn them into
0:48
courses, create images and content, and set up automated agent workflows that run tasks for you. This isn't just
0:54
theory. We're building real projects like a YouTube to study guide and co assistant that audits your site
1:00
instantly and a content planner that maps out months of posts in seconds. Everything is practical and you can
1:06
start today. Best part, most of this is completely free. Let's dive in. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital
1:13
avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's
1:19
helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Julian Goldie reads
1:26
every comment, so make sure you comment below and let me know what you think. Okay, so Google just went absolutely
1:31
insane with these Gemini updates. And I'm not talking about small stuff. I'm talking about features that actually
1:36
change how you use AI every single day. Let me show you what just dropped. First thing, translation just got stupid good.
1:44
Google Translate now runs on Gemini. And this isn't your old Google Translate that gives you weird robot words. This
1:50
is natural, like talking to a real person. The AI understands context now. It gets tone. It gets what you actually
1:56
mean. Not just word for word translation. This is huge because most translation tools sound fake. But Gemini
2:03
makes it sound like how people actually talk. But here's where it gets insane. They added live speech to speech
2:08
translation. And it's in beta right now. What does that mean? You put on any headphones, any headphones you already
2:13
own, and you can have real-time conversations in 70 different languages. Think about that. You're traveling.
2:19
Someone speaks a language you don't know. You both put on headphones and you just talk. The AI translates everything
2:25
live both ways. It even keeps the tone and cadence, so it sounds natural, not robotic. This is like having a
2:31
professional translator in your pocket, but it's free and it works with any headphones you already have. If you have
2:37
Google AI Pro, you can now share your plan with five people. You just add them and they get full access to the premium
2:43
AI models. You split it with your team or your family. Everyone gets Gemini 3 Pro. Everyone gets the advanced
2:49
features. This is insane value. And if you don't want to share your main account, you can give people a fourmonth
2:54
free trial instead. So you can let people try the best AI models. This makes premium AI accessible to way more
3:00
people. But wait, there's more. And this is where it gets really interesting for power users. Google just launched
3:06
something called Disco. It's a new AI playground on the web. And the first feature is called Gen Tabs. This is
3:13
crazy. You know how you have a bunch of browser tabs open? Gentabs takes those tabs and remixes them into custom web
3:20
apps. Using Gemini 3, let me say that again. Your tabs become apps. You're researching something. You have 10 tabs
3:27
open. Genabs turns all that into a working application customized for what you're doing. This is next level
3:32
productivity because instead of jumping between tabs, you have one unified workspace built by AI in seconds. Okay,
3:40
here's something for the content creators and marketers. There's a tool called Pomelli and they just added an
3:45
animate feature. What does it do? You take your brand content, your static images, your designs and it animates
3:50
them using Veo 3.1 which is Google's video AI model. So now you can turn still images into animated videos
3:58
automatically. No video editing skills needed. The AI does it for you. This is massive for social media, for ads, for
4:05
any kind of visual content because video performs way better than static images. And now the AI just makes the videos for
4:11
you. Now, if you want to save time and automate your business with AI tools like Google Gemini, you need to check
4:17
out the AI profit boardroom. This is where we teach you how to scale your business, get more customers, and save
4:24
hundreds of hours with AI automation. We cover all these tools. We give you the exact processes, and you get to see how
4:29
other businesses are using Gemini and other AI tools to grow faster. The link is in the description. And trust me, if
4:36
you're serious about using AI in your business, this is where you want to be. And if you're using Mixboard, they just
4:41
shipped a bunch of new features. You can now do portfolio presentations using
4:46
Nano Banana Pro, which is one of the new Gemini models. You can work on multibboard projects. So, bigger, more
4:52
complex work. And they added support for way more file types. This makes Mixboard way more powerful for creators who want
4:59
AI integrated into their whole workflow. You're not just making one thing, you're building entire projects and the AI
5:05
helps with all of it. There's something called Doppel. It's a fashion try on AI and they just made it way better. Now
5:12
you get a personalized recommendations feed so the AI learns your style and shows you clothes that actually match
5:18
what you like or you can shop looks directly. Just click and buy. And there's a collections feature so you can
5:24
save looks you want to try later. This is cool because AI is getting really good at understanding style and now it
5:30
can help you shop without you having to browse forever. The AI just shows you what works for you. Now, let's talk
5:36
about the developer stuff because this matters even if you're not a developer. There's a tool called Jules Agent and it
5:42
now predicts and fixes tasks before you even ask. That's proactive AI. It's not
5:48
waiting for you to tell it what to do. It's looking ahead, seeing what needs to happen, and doing it. Then there's
5:53
Stitch by Google and it now supports built-in with Gemini 3. So developers
5:59
can integrate the newest AI models into their apps. And there's something called the Gemini deep research agent. You can
6:05
access it through the interactions API. What does that mean? You can embed AI research capabilities into your own
6:11
tools. So the AI can do deep research for you automatically inside whatever app you're building. And here's why this
Translation & Live Speech Features
6:18
matters to you. Even if you're not building apps, when developers get better tools, the apps you use get
6:23
better. The AI features you rely on get smarter. So all these developer updates mean the tools you use every day are
6:30
about to get way more powerful. That's the real benefit here. Google also launched two new benchmark tools and
6:35
these are important. The first one is called deep search QA. It's open source and it evaluates how good AI agents are
6:42
at web research. So we can actually measure if the AI is finding good information or if it's just making stuff
6:47
up. The second one is called the facts benchmark suite. This is the first comprehensive way to evaluate
6:53
factuality. It checks internal knowledge. It checks grounding. It checks multimodal stuff. Basically, it
7:00
measures how real the AI's answers are. And why does this matter? Because AI that checks itself is AI you can
7:06
actually trust. These benchmarks mean Google is being transparent about how accurate their models are. And that's
7:11
huge for anyone using AI for real work. And here's what most people miss. Google is in a full-on AI war with Open AAI.
7:19
OpenAI just launched GPT 5.2 after what they called a code red push. They're trying to counter Google's Gemini 3.
7:26
This competition is insane. And you know what that means? Both companies are going to keep dropping better features,
7:31
faster updates, more free stuff because they're fighting for users. And that's amazing for us because we get better AI
7:37
tools. So, what should you actually do with all this? Start with the translation feature. If you travel, if
7:43
you work with international clients, if you're learning a language, this is a gamecher. Test it out. See how good it
7:48
really is. Then, if you have Google AI Pro, set up that sharing plan. Get your team on it. Or give someone that 4 month
7:55
trial. Let them experience premium AI. And if you're a power user, try Gen Tabs. See if turning your tabs into apps
8:03
actually saves you time. My guess is it will, especially if you're doing research or managing multiple projects.
8:09
For creators, try Pomellle and Mixboard. See if the AI can actually make your content workflow faster. And if you're
8:15
in fashion or e-commerce, check out Doppel. The personalization might surprise you. The point is, don't just
8:21
watch videos about this stuff. Actually use it. That's where the real value is. That's where you figure out what
8:26
actually helps your business or your life. Now, if you want to save time and automate your business with AI tools
8:32
like Google Gemini, you need to check out the AI Profit Boardroom. This is where we teach you how to scale your
8:38
business, get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with AI automation. We cover all these tools. We give you the
8:44
exact processes, and you get to see how other businesses are using Gemini and other AI tools to grow faster. The link
8:51
is in the description. And trust me, if you're serious about using AI in your business, this is where you want to be.
8:56
And if you want the full process, SOPs, and 100 plus AI use cases like this one,
9:02
join the AI success lab. Links in the comments and description. Gemini 3 can now do deep research and create visual
9:09
reports with charts, images, and simulations. This is a gamecher for business owners. I'm going to show you
9:15
exactly how to use it and how it can save you hundreds of hours every single month. Let's go. So, Google just
9:22
released an update to Gemini that honestly blew my mind. This is different. This is actually useful. Let
9:27
me tell you why. Before this update, if you wanted to do deep research on something, you had two options. You
9:33
could spend hours doing it yourself, going through dozens of websites, taking notes, organizing everything, or you
9:39
could ask an AI to help, but you just get a wall of text. The new deep research feature doesn't just give you
9:45
text anymore. It creates full visual reports where we're talking custom images, charts, graphs, and even
9:51
interactive simulations, all built specifically for your question, all organized in a way that actually makes
9:57
sense. This is huge for anyone running a business, creating content, or trying to understand complex topics fast. Let me
10:03
show you how this works in practice. I'm going to use examples that are directly relevant to growing an online business,
10:10
specifically something like the AI profit boardroom, because that's the whole point, right? We want to see how this tool actually helps real businesses
10:18
get more customers and leads, not just theory, real world application. First, let's talk about what deep research
10:24
actually is. Once you select deep research in Gemini, you're not just getting a quick answer. You're getting a
10:29
full research assistant that goes out and analyzes tons of sources, synthesizes all that information, and
10:34
then presents it back to you in a comprehensive report. But here's where it gets interesting with this new update. Now, it doesn't just dump text
10:42
on you. It creates visuals that help you understand the data better, charts that
10:47
show trends, images that illustrate concepts, simulations that let you play with different scenarios. Here's a real
10:54
example. Let's say you're running the AI profit boardroom and you want to understand how AI automation is changing
11:00
the way businesses operate in different industries. Before, you'd have to research this yourself. You'd visit 10
11:05
or 20 websites. You'd read articles. You take notes. You try to organize it all in your head or in a document. That's
11:11
hours of work, maybe even days if you want to do it right now. With Gemini 3 deep research, you just type in your
11:16
question. something like analyze how AI automation is transforming business operations across five major industries
11:22
and create a visual report showing adoption rates, cost savings, and implementation challenges. You hit
11:28
enter, you select deep research, and then you wait. But here's the thing, you're not waiting long, maybe 10 or 15
11:33
minutes depending on how complex your question is. And what you get back is incredible. Now, if you want to dive
11:39
even deeper into AI automation, I've got something special for you. I run a community called the AI profit
11:44
boardroom. The best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds with AI automation. Learn how
11:50
to save time and automate your business with AI tools like Gemini 3. Link is in the comment and description. It's at
11:57
school.com/IprofitLab. You get a full report with sections breaking down each industry. You get
12:02
charts showing adoption rates over time. You get graphs comparing cost savings across different sectors. You get images
12:08
showing actual AI tools being used in those industries. and you get interactive simulations where you can
12:13
adjust variables and see how outcomes change. All of this is created automatically. All of this is sourced
12:21
from real data. All of this is presented in a way that's actually easy to understand and use. Now, let me show you
12:26
another example that's super relevant. If you're trying to grow a community or business online, let's say you want to
12:31
create a content strategy for the AI profit boardroom. You want to know what topics are trending, what people are
12:37
searching for, what kind of content gets the most engagement. Normally, you'd have to use multiple tools. You'd check
12:42
Google Trends. You'd look at competitor content. You'd analyze social media. You'd piece it all together yourself.
12:48
With Gemini 3 Deep Research, you can ask it to research the top trending AI automation topics in business
12:55
communities over the past 6 months, analyze engagement patterns, and create a visual content calendar with
13:00
recommended topics, formats, and posting schedules. What you get back is a full visual report. You get a chart showing
13:06
search volume trends for different topics. You get a breakdown of which content formats work best, like videos
13:12
versus articles versus tutorials. You get a visual calendar showing when to post what type of content for maximum
13:18
impact. And you get data on what competitors are doing that's working. This is where it gets really powerful for business owners because now you're
13:24
not guessing. You're not going with your gut. You're making decisions based on actual research and data, but you're not
13:30
spending weeks doing that research. You're getting it all in one comprehensive visual report in minutes.
13:36
Let me give you another practical example. Budget allocation. This is something every business struggles with.
13:41
Where do you spend your resources? How much should you invest in different areas? What's going to give you the best
13:46
return? These are hard questions and usually you'd need to hire a consultant or spend tons of time analyzing
13:52
everything yourself. Now, you can ask Gemini 3 to analyze optimal budget allocation for an AI automation business
13:59
focusing on content creation, community building, and tool development. then create visual models showing different
14:05
scenarios and their projected outcomes. What you get is amazing. You get pie charts showing recommended budget
14:11
splits. You get bar graphs comparing different allocation strategies. You get visual simulations where you can adjust
14:17
the budget percentages and see how it affects different outcomes. You can literally play with the numbers and see
14:23
what happens. And here's what makes this so valuable. It's not just showing you one answer. It's showing you multiple
14:29
scenarios. It's helping you understand the trade-offs. If you invest more in content creation, what happens to
14:35
community growth? If you focus more on tool development, how does that impact your content output? These are the kinds
14:41
of questions that help you make smarter decisions. And now you can see the answers visually instead of trying to
14:46
imagine them in your head. The visual aspect is what really sets this apart from everything else out there. Our
14:52
brains process visuals way faster than text. Studies show we can understand a chart or graph in seconds, but the same
14:58
information in text form might take minutes to fully grasp. So, when Gemini creates these visual reports, it's not
15:04
just making things prettier, it's making the information more accessible and more useful. Let me show you how this works
15:09
for content creation specifically. Say you're planning a series of videos for your community about AI tools. You want
15:16
to know which tools to cover in what order and what angles to take. You could spend hours researching different AI
15:22
tools, looking at reviews, checking popularity, trying to figure out what your audience wants. Or you could ask
15:28
Gemini to research the top 20 AI automation tools for business owners, analyze their features, user
15:34
satisfaction, and learning curves, then create a visual guide ranking them by usefulness for different business tasks.
15:39
What you get back is incredible. You get a visual matrix showing all the tools on different axis. Maybe one axis is ease
15:46
of use and the other is power. You can see at a glance which tools are simple but limited versus which ones are
15:51
complex but powerful. You get charts showing user satisfaction scores. You get images of each tools interface. You
15:57
get breakdowns of pricing. And you get recommendations for which tools to cover first based on what your audience needs
16:03
most. Now, here's something really cool about the interactive simulations. Let's say you're trying to understand how
16:08
different variables affect business growth. You want to know how posting frequency, content quality, and community engagement all work together.
16:15
This is complex stuff. There are lots of moving parts. Traditionally, you'd need a data scientist to build models for
16:20
this. With Gemini 3, you can ask it to create an interactive simulation showing how posting frequency, content depth,
16:27
and community interaction rates affect overall community growth for an AI automation business with adjustable
16:33
variables to test different strategies. What you get is a simulation you can actually play with. You can move sliders
16:39
to adjust posting frequency from once a week to daily. You can change content depth from quick tips to deep tutorials.
16:45
You can adjust community interaction rates. And as you change these variables, you see the projected outcomes change in real time with visual
16:53
graphs showing the impact. This is powerful because now you can test strategies without actually implementing
16:58
them. You can see what might work before you commit time and resources. You can explore different scenarios and
17:03
understand the potential outcomes. This is a kind of strategic planning tool that used to require expensive software
17:10
and consultants. Now it's built right into Gemini. Let me talk about how this helps with understanding complex topics.
17:15
One of the biggest challenges in AI and automation is that things move fast. New tools come out every week. New
17:22
techniques get developed. New research gets published. It's hard to keep up. And when you're trying to educate a
17:28
community like the AI profit boardroom, you need to stay on top of everything. With deep research, you can ask Gemini
17:34
to analyze the latest developments in AI automation over the past month, identify the most significant updates, and create
17:40
a visual report showing how each development impacts different business functions. What you get is a timeline
17:46
visualization showing when each major update happened. You get descriptions of what changed and why it matters. You get
17:53
charts showing which industries are affected most. You get comparisons showing how the new capabilities stack
17:59
up against older methods. All of this is organized visually so you can scan it quickly and understand the landscape.
18:05
This is especially useful when you're creating educational content because now instead of just talking about something,
18:10
you can show it. You can reference the charts and graphs that Gemini created. You can walk your audience through the visual data. You can make complex topics
18:17
simple and engaging. And you can do all of this without spending hours creating graphics yourself or hiring a designer.
18:24
If you want to dive even deeper into AI automation, I've got something special for you. I run a community called the AI
18:30
profit boardroom. The best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds with AI automation.
18:36
Learn how to save time and automate your business with AI tools like Gemini 3. And if you want the full process, SOPs,
18:42
and 100 plus a I use cases like this one. Join the AI success lab, links in
18:48
the comments and description. You'll get all the video notes from there, plus access to our community of 38,000
18:53
members who are crushing it with AI. We share what's working, what's not, and how to actually implement these tools in
18:59
your business. No fluff, just practical strategies that work. Link is in the comment and description. Today, I'm
Deep Research with Visual Reports
19:05
going to show you how to build anything with Google Gemini. So, today we're deep diving into Google Gemini 3 and the
19:12
entire Google ecosystem for AI. And this is not just like another AI model drop.
19:19
This is Google showing you how to automate your entire business without writing a single line of code. So,
19:24
here's what you're getting during this live stream. I'm going to show you how Notebook LM turns any content into automate videos and podcasts that work
19:30
for you. We're going to look at Google Gems and basically this is Google's answers to custom GPTs that actually
19:37
work for your business. We'll look at Ve3 video automation, AI Studio, and
19:43
image generation as well inside Gemini. And this is the same ecosystem that lets you compete with teams of other people
19:50
by just using these free tools. And the setup is pretty simple. So, I'm showing you exactly how everything connects
19:55
together. And if you've been using Chat GPT or Claude and feeling like you're missing out, you are. Google just handed
20:01
you a complete automation system. Most people have no idea how to actually use it. So, stay locked in. This changes
20:07
everything. Let's get straight into. So, you can use Google Gemini 3 inside gemini.google.com.
20:13
And from here, you can actually switch between these different tools. So, for example, let's say you want to do something like deep research. Deep
20:18
research is really good for just going super deep on a certain topic. So if you have a specific problem inside your
20:24
business, deep research is one of the best ways to really figure out or learn the skill required to help you build that constraint. So let's say for
20:31
example, I need to improve churn rates at my SEO agency. I can say, okay, do a
20:37
deep dive on how to improve term rates for my agency plus some of the best
20:42
strategies and actionable methods to improve that. And you can easily do that. Now in the meantime whilst we're
20:49
waiting for that if you're looking for ideas if you're not sure okay what do I need to actually do do on or how can I use this practically for my business and
20:55
personalize it to mine let's say you've been using claude you could go inside claude here and you could say okay what's the normal constraint inside my
21:03
business that I need to fix and from here you can get an idea now claude or gemini or chat GPT whichever AI you
21:09
speak to most will give you the answers right so for example here if you look at this example it's based on your current
21:16
situation right it's very personalized to The number one constraint is the awareness specifically why don't 100x
21:21
more people know about the air profit boardroom for example right and then it will give you a bunch of ideas and then you can plug that into Gemini for
21:28
example and you could go okay give me a deep research report that helps me solve
21:34
this problem right hit enter it'll give you a proposal based on that and then from there you can start building this
21:40
out Lee Davis says it's not live it's an old live it is a new live don't worry about that Lee we got someone from
21:46
Portugal welcome them back. By the way, these videos when we upload them after 24 hours, YouTube autodubs them. But
21:52
from here, we can start getting the research report. See, for example, you got improving SEO agency retention and
21:57
it's basically going to research, analyze, investigate, give us actionable communication strategies, explore
22:02
methods to fix it, identify proactive health check systems, and then look at retention tactics that improve results.
22:09
And if you're happy with that, you can just click research. If you're not happy with that, you can click edit plan and then edit this before you actually go
22:16
ahead. Right? So you can actually say, okay, give me a list of actionable
22:21
strategies plus organize them by the highest impact task first. Then turn
22:27
this into a 30-day actionable plan. And from here, you can start going off and doing it. Right? Lee says, "Oops, I
22:34
standed corrected. It is live." There we go. CPT says, "Here's my guy. Could see
22:39
it." And we're going to keep going through with this. All right. So, we're building this out. As you can see, it's updated the list. Now, we can approve
22:44
it. Here, start research. And we can start automating it. Now, I think that's one of the most underrated ways to use this. What we can also do here is we can
22:52
actually go into notebook. Notebook is another free tool that uses Gemini 3.
22:57
And then from here, we can start building stuff out as well, right? So for example, if you saw my live stream yesterday, you saw that we took our
23:03
sales training SAP. Plug that into notebook created a kind of custom GBT as you can see here, but it's a notebook
23:09
and it's trained on our specific sales training. And then from here, we've got all these things on the right hand side.
23:15
So for example, we actually have a slide deck, right? If we pull this up, we've got a beautifully designed slide deck
23:21
that we've automated with AI. And you can see how cool this is and the way that it's used. One of the best things
23:26
about this is it's designed. This is the research that we've plugged in. So the sources that we've used specifically. So I plugged in the sales playbook for our
23:34
team. And then you can see that it's designed it into a beautiful slideshow presentation as you can see right and
23:39
it's super actionable. It's easy to understand. It makes it easy for anyone reading this. And like the old way of
23:45
designing presentations was time consuming, energy draining and honestly you probably couldn't create something
23:50
as nice as this. I personally couldn't anyway. And you can see how it's for example even taken our core principles
23:55
and the ideas from our sales playbook and turned that into like really digestible ways to actually implement
24:00
this stuff. Right? So really powerful. And then on the right hand side here you can see as well we have a client report
24:06
right. So we have a report that we can use for understanding this. We have a infographic as you can see. So it talks
24:13
about okay what we sell, how we win etc. What we do etc. And then also we even have for example a video. I'm just going
24:20
to mute, but this does have narration over the top and you can play this full screen. And then you can see here we
24:25
have a full animated and narrated video custom designed by the notebook with the information that we plugged in. Right?
24:31
So in literally a few seconds you can automate infographics, slide decks,
24:37
presentations, videos, even podcasts. If we actually go back here and we scroll to the right hand side, you can see we
24:43
have a bunch of podcasts and we even have a mind map, right? So if people are not sure, okay, I need to learn more about the playbook, but I'm not sure
24:50
about, okay, for example, how to do end of day updates or how to analyze the client's content, we can click on that
24:56
and they will actually give us information and break down each part of the report based on exactly what we need
25:01
to do. So for example, like day-to-day activities and then it tells you exactly what to do if you're learning this stuff, right? So for example, fill out
25:07
the sales tracker, join the daily team sales meeting, track every lead, use the sales checklist if you don't have any calls, do your end of day updates,
25:13
right? It breaks everything down from a really long playbook into something that's absolutely awesome. Amaro says in
25:19
the grid, I hope you're agreeing with me. And then you can see here we've got the responses inside the notebook. Now,
25:24
if you need to set up, all you do is you go inside like create a new notebook. And then whenever you want to learn or
25:29
automate or create reports or slide decks or videos or podcasts around, you can go on to YouTube here. Let's say, for example, I want to learn about how
25:36
to use, let's see what we got, Google Disco, right? Let's say I want to learn about Google Disco. I can take this
25:42
video, plug that into notebooks, click on YouTube, paste that in, hit insert,
25:47
and now based on that information, we can now custom train the notebook and automate audio, video, my maps, reports,
25:54
flashcards, quizzes, infographics, slide decks, and we can do all of that in one click. Now, if we need to customize them
25:59
even more, we can click on the edit button here, and we're good to go on that. Now, if we go back to Gemini here, we've got the deep research report being
26:06
created, and as you can see, it's researching loads of different sources. So you can see for example it's reaching
26:12
researching like SEO Mars. I think we've got paddle reddit even YouTube surfer SEO as well all these different places
26:19
and then identifying the primary causes of churn based on all these different sources. These are all specific to my
26:25
industry and the SEO industry as a whole. And then as we scroll down it's taking even more sources. Like look at
26:30
this. It's literally researching every single possible resource on the internet and then building out this report.
26:36
Really cool. And it's also going to use Nana Bananas to create visuals for the report as well. Now, Sherifa says, "Is
26:43
there a list of steps to do this?" Yeah. So, actually, if you go to the AI success lab, which is a completely free
26:48
community where you can connect with 39,000 members, you can actually post inside the community here. It's quite an active community. And then inside the
26:54
classroom, if you scroll fast, all of these automations, you can see we just keep adding new automations as soon as
27:01
new updates come out. And if we scroll down, you can get access to the notes from today. So if we scroll up to this
27:07
section right here, what you're going to see is that we actually have a full implementation road map for using this
27:12
stuff. So if you want to learn how to use Gemini 3 notebook, etc., we have a list of full step-by-step actionable
27:18
ways to learn and master this stuff within 30 days. So you can get that for free link in the comments description. Now, if we go back to Gemini, it's right
27:24
in the report. So that will take a few minutes to generate. You can see how easy this stuff is. And you've also got notebook LM working there as well. All
27:31
right. Now if we also want to build many apps or landing pages or websites for example or even tools we can go over to
27:39
AI studio astudio.google.com google.com as you can see. Now on the left hand side if you click on build over here you
27:44
can then describe your idea and inside this section you can basically describe exactly what you want right so let's say
27:50
for example I need to build a tool maybe I'm not sure what tool I need to build so I can go on to the AI that I use the
27:56
most right now so for example FL I can say give me some ideas plus prompts the basic mini apps I can build plus order
28:03
them in terms of the highest impact tools I could build today make them
28:09
super simple so they're easy to build app basically because Claude or Gemini or CHP whichever one you use the most
28:16
knows you the best. It will actually know exactly what to build and what to create before you build it. And if
28:21
you're not sure where to start, this is one of the best places to find what you need to build, right? So, for example, like a gem risk calculator or a school
28:27
launch calculator or a YouTube clip analyzer, right? And you see it's actually given us high value ones here.
28:32
So, these are like top priority. These are the high value and these are the quick wins. Now, why is that useful? It's useful because number one, you've
28:38
got a bunch of ideas customized to you. But number two, you can quickly copy and paste these prompts into AI Studio to
28:44
build whatever you want. And number three, this orders it in terms of what's the most useful, what's going to save you the most time right now. What could
28:49
you implement today that would help you the most? There's no point building the app if you're not actually going to use it. So this is the best place to start.
28:56
And then from there, you can start building out whatever you want, right? And you can see how easy it is to do. Now, AR Studio is actually free to to
29:01
build with up to certain limits. So what you can do, for example, is let's say we wanted to create this, right? The
29:06
generous calculator. We can copy this like so, right? And then we say okay create a prompt for building this. And
29:12
now we can identify exactly how to build it as well. Right? So I don't need to think of the idea. I don't need to think of which one is most important. I don't
29:19
even need to think about how to prompt the AI studio to create it. I can just copy this prompt like you can see right
29:25
here. Then we can go over to AI studio. Plug that in. And over here you can see the supercharger apps with AI. Right? So
29:31
let's say you were creating something that was voice powered. Well, you could click on that and it would actually add it as an operator inside the AI studio
29:39
prompts, right? Which means that when you're building this out, it's going to use different elements of all the AI
29:44
ecosystem within Google. So, for example, you could empower this tool to use Google search data or animate images
29:50
or create conversational voice apps or generate images yourself with it. Right? So, the difference between this and this
29:55
is that with this one, you generate video, with this one, you generate images, right? And then we can X off that, click build, and we're good to go
30:02
on that. Now, whilst we're waiting for that to build, let me show you exactly what I've built previously. This helped me a lot. For example, if I go to apps
30:08
over here, you can see we built like a live keyword generator, a research visualizer, AI content creator, landing
30:13
page builder, the AI support voice agent, right? This is actually a live voice agent that I can interact with and
30:18
ask questions to. As you can see, I just have to allow my microphone. And then from here, I can start asking the AI
30:24
questions with the voice agent. And all this stuff is super easy to build. So, this is building in the background right
30:29
now, as you can see. And then we'll just wait for that. It's just been running for 35 seconds. It will take a little while to generate. If we go back to
30:36
Google Gemite, we now have the deep research report. As you can see, we can actually export that, right? So, we can
30:41
export it to Google Docs if that's easier to read and learn from. So, if we export that to Google Docs, you can see
30:46
how this operates within the ecosystem. So, not only can you use like notebook or Google Gemini and AI Studio to build
30:53
stuff and automate stuff for you, but also you can again export this stuff to, for example, Google Docs or Google
31:00
Sheets, etc., and just make it super easy and simple, right? It's gio something that we're learning. Also, if you want to learn about geo, check out
31:06
the AI profit boardroom. So, if you go to AI profit boardroom here, go to the classroom and then type in SEO AI SEO.
31:13
You can go to the best AI SEO automations. Link in the comments description and you can learn about GEO
31:18
and how to rank inside AI search engines and how to leverage AI to rank using these processes as well. So check out
31:24
the AI profit board linked in the comments description if you want to learn about GEO and how to rank inside AR search engines. Right now we've got
31:31
the churn risk calculator as you can see and it's broken down all the figures. We literally built this within a couple of minutes. You can see how it actually
31:37
visualizes the data as well that we plug in. And then from here we can change these and interact with it. So you see
31:42
how the chart changes based on the information we plug in. This is super interactive and easy to use, right? So
31:48
for example here we can plug this in. We're good to go. And then and she has a nice little quote at the bottom over
31:53
here. And if we actually want to deploy this, we can deploy it over here. And then we can select a cloud project. For example, like this one. We can verify
31:59
that project. And then once that's done, it will actually launch on a subdomain as you can see over here. Right? So if
32:06
we click on deploy app, let's wait for that to load. Again, it's going to verify. And we have it inside the AI
32:11
space as you can see. We'll close that tab. And that will deploy to cloud. Right? Now, whilst we're waiting, let's go back to the deep research report. And
32:18
you can see that it's now created a really in-depth report like 19 pages, right? Super detailed report covering
32:24
every single thing we needed to learn about that particular topic. And you can see how it's visualized data for
32:29
example. So the quick win prioritization and then also if we keep scrolling down here, it's covered pretty much
32:35
everything that we wanted to do. And as we customize it, it's actually given us a 30-day implementable actionable master
32:42
plan on how to improve our turn rates. Right? So you can see here how basically any sort of business constraint that you
32:48
have, you can easily quickly build this stuff out and go from here step by step. When in reality says, did you know you
32:54
can merge two tabs in Chrome now for a sideby-side view? Just click on the tab you want to merge with the one that you're on with a new Google apps feature
33:00
that I actually don't have access to, but you can do add tab to new split view as well, right? Which is pretty cool. Let's try this out. All right, so we got
33:06
side by side. Oh, this is cool. Thanks for the suggestion. So you can see that we've merged. This is really cool as
33:11
well. Thank you very much for the suggestion. That's awesome. Shout out to Winning Reality. So you can see here
33:16
we've actually split two tabs into one so we can see them side by side. So we've got the deep research report over
33:22
here and then over here we have the tool that we've created, right? Pretty nice. And then we can X off that and it will just go back to the normal view. Boom.
33:28
Shakalaka, my friends. All right, we're learning stuff as we go along. Claude has extra features, right? Yeah, Claude
33:33
is really good, too. But today we are covering Gemini, so we're going to focus on that. But as you can see here as
33:39
well, it's created some nice visualizations here. So you've got for example like the value of despair in SEO
33:44
client retention and it's created like a really nice report that shows you okay here's the honeymoon period of an SEO
33:50
agency or when a client signs up to an SEO agency and then this is how things compound over time. So if you had a
33:57
constraint like this in the business you could just say okay give me the 30-day plan research everything on the internet about that particular topic and then
34:03
from there we're good to go. Super simple and easy to implement. And just to recap, we have so far generated a
34:10
deep research report, automated infographics, podcasts, mind maps, quizzes, flashcards, etc. with no
34:15
length. We've exported that information to the deep research report inside Google Docs. And then also on AI Studio,
34:23
we've built out a mini app that calculates our gem rates and how to improve it, right? Pretty simple and easy to do this stuff. So, it's amazing
34:29
what you can do with Google Gem Lab. Right? Now, as well, if we go back to the new chat here, the other thing that I like to do is just edit images. So,
34:35
for example, let's say I'm preparing for a live stream. What we can do here is we can upload a file. So, for example, I
34:40
could upload a YouTube thumbnail that I want to use. Let me try and find one here. Here we go. So, we got YouTube
34:46
thumbnail here. And if we have a look at this image, you can see it says this, right? So, there's actually a spelling
34:51
error inside the thumbnail. Right. So, we can now go inside Gemini. We go on tools, create images, use an banana, and
34:57
we're using Gemini 3 as well in combination with that. And then we can say, okay, change to latest. and we can
35:03
actually edit that thumbnail so that it generates a corrected version of the thumbnail. So, you know, if you need to move fast or if you need to change
35:09
something or let's say, for example, I wanted to focus on creating a live stream about Gemini 3 instead of
35:15
notebook 11, I could actually just go inside the chat, describe exactly what I want and edit the image right there. And then it will take a couple of minutes to
35:21
generate that. As you can see, it will modify the text, pinpoint the error, refine the output, and then eventually
35:27
we will get an image that looks something like this with the new spelling, right? the corrected updated
35:32
grammar. So, you can see how easy it is to do all this stuff. How to edit images, how to create videos, how to create images, infographics, reports, my
35:39
maps, flashcards, mini apps, etc. And you can do this all inside Google's ecosystem. Amara says, "Amazing. Happy
35:45
to. Any updates on Veo 3? Sorry, Veer 4. Not that I've seen so far, but I am I'm watching out carefully for that. I think
35:51
it'll be exciting when it comes out." All right. So, let me tell you the story behind this live stream. 3 weeks ago, I was sitting on my desk here at my to-do
35:57
list. content calendars, client work, community management, lead generation, video editing, podcast production, social media scheduling, and it's the
36:03
same list that every solarpreneur or business owner has, and it's the same overwhelm. Now, I've been using AI tools
36:08
for months, like chat GPT for writing, called for research, sometimes midjourney for images, all separate, all
36:14
disconnected. Every task require me to copy and paste between five different apps, remember five different prompts, manage five different subscriptions, and
36:20
then Google drops Gemini 3 across a whole ecosystem, and something clicks, right? This isn't just a faster model.
36:26
This is like the first time you can actually automate your entire content pipeline without switching apps without coding, without hiring anyone. And I've
36:33
spent hours testing everything. So notebook for podcasts. You can use gems. So Google gems inside Gemab 3 for
36:41
creating like the alternatives to like custom GPTs for example. You can use V3 for video content. AR studio for custom
Notebook LM: Automate Content Creation
36:48
tools. All inside one ecosystem that you probably already use every single day, right? So most business owners are using
36:54
Google Docs or Google Drive or even Google itself. And by day three, I'd pretty much automated many tasks that
36:59
used to take me like 20 hours per week. And the emotional shift wild, right? I literally went from I need to hire
37:04
someone to do all this stuff to I just built this myself in a few clicks and a couple of prompts like I've shown you today already. And that's why I'm
37:10
breaking this down today because I don't want to hype up Google, but really I just want to show you that this is the first complete automation system
37:16
designed for nontechnical business owners. And most of this stuff that I'm showing is free today. So it's pretty
37:23
amazing what you can do. Now, let me talk to you about the old way versus the new way and also some ways you can
37:28
actually use this. So, again, we've got the video notes from today inside the AI success lab link in the comments description if you want to get this
37:34
stuff. But let's talk about some of the limiting beliefs that hold business owners back when it comes to using this technology. So, one of the first things
37:39
that people believe is I need to learn one AI tool really well. People say I need to master chat cheap before I try
37:45
anything else or focus on one tool or go deep not wide. But here's the truth there is you're not actually going deep.
37:50
You're just getting comfortable and that's a big difference, right? So going deep with an AI tool means building complete systems that handle entire
37:56
business processes. And getting comfortable means you know how to write good prompts that you're still copying and pasting between apps all day. A
38:02
waste of time, right? And the real problem here is like it's depth. It's not depth. The real problem is ecosystem
38:08
thinking versus tool thinking, right? So successful solopreneurs like they don't just master individual tools. They
38:14
master connected systems. So Google's ecosystem lets you take research from Gemini, turn it into a podcast in no
38:21
clim generate videos inside A3, schedule all through workspace and then track everything in one place. And that's not
38:26
like learning more tools. That's building one complete automation pipeline that replaces like three people on your team. And so the simple rule
38:32
that I recommend is like stop thinking about individual AI tools and start thinking about complete business
38:37
processes and then find the ecosystem that handles the entire process without you jumping between apps. Right? So when
38:44
you pick an ecosystem, for example, it could be Microsoft, it could be Google, whatever you want. You learn it once, you everything. When you pick individual
38:50
tools, you learn forever and still manually have to connect all the pieces. So just pick one ecosystem, learn how
38:56
the pieces connect and then build complete workflows, not individual tasks. So for example, let's say I want to build out a content automation
39:02
workflow. Right? What I can do is I can go on to another and let's say I need to create some content around for example I
39:09
need let's say I need to create content around the new Google disco update right I'm going to type in Google disco here
39:15
right we can just use fast research and we can use the web right so I can type in Google disco update like so hit enter
39:22
and then it will start researching websites that I can custom train the AI into and then from there I've got my full content pipeline because I've got
39:28
my audio my video my mind my maps my reports flashcards quizzes infographics and slide decks all in one single place.
39:34
So you see how easy it is to do this stuff, right? So we can import those in, train the AI on the sources you want. If
39:40
we don't want to use some of these sources, we can actually just remove them. So we can actually rename them as well. And then boom, and we just click
39:46
on all these and start generating stuff. Right now, the other thing that a lot of people struggle with is that they think
39:51
AI tools are too complicated for them. And the old broken belief was like people would say, I'm not technical.
39:57
These tools are for developers and tech people. It's I'll wait until it's easier. But here's what's actually happening. you're not technical, right?
40:03
You're just scared of maybe looking silly or struggling to learn something new. And every successful person you admire probably felt the same way when
40:10
they started. But I think the I'm not technical story is just fear wearing a different mask. And the new reality is
40:16
that the real problem is not your technical ability. The real problem is your tolerance for feeling confused whilst building something new. And we've
40:22
all been there. I've been there personally. And so Google Gemini's 3 ecosystem requires like zero coding. Not
40:28
like minimal coding or basic coding. Literally zero. You just describe what you want. The system builds it. You can
40:33
go into notebookm and you just click a button to generate that podcast. Right? So if we go back to notebookm using that
40:40
Google disco information we've created, right? Literally to generate this mind map, we just clicked a button. That was
40:45
it. It was super easy and simple. And then you can see that we're generating the video and audio view over here with
40:51
one click. It wasn't technical at all. So that's it. If you can write an email, you can build with these tools. And the simple rule is technical skill is not
40:58
the requirement. Clear communication is requirement. If you can explain your business process to a human assistant, you can explain it to Google's AI. So, I
41:05
would stop saying I'm too tech, I'm not technical, and start saying, "I haven't learned this yet." And then just spend 30 minutes testing one tool because if I
41:12
could do it, you can do it and anyone could do it. All right. So, we've got a Google Gemini over here. I'm going to keep going from here. And then Jason
41:18
says, "Have you ever set up change log road map or style guide as part of the project?" I don't mess around with that stuff. Again, I want to keep it like
41:23
non-technical and as easy as possible, but you can if you want to. Like you can change anything you want to. If you're
41:28
more technical, if you need more customization, you can just go into AI studio or whatever tool you're using and start creating this stuff right and even
41:36
for example for generating videos like literally if you want to generate a video for example like this one let's have a look at this video right let's
41:41
have a look at this image right I can copy this can go into tools that create
41:46
videos new chat plug in the image that we just had before a second ago this one and then we can say okay create a video
41:54
of this man talking about chat GVT is over, right? Something like that. And
42:00
then we can quickly generate a video all inside the same ecosystem as you can, right? And now it's generating the
42:05
video. And that should just take a couple of minutes as well. Now, the other belief that a lot of people say is, and that's actually refused to make
42:12
a a video of me, but I think it's cuz we got a thumbnail in there. That's okay. Sometimes these things break, and that's
42:17
okay. I can show you how to fix them. So if we change to Vera 3 now we'll say okay create a video of an SEO talking
42:24
about how to do SEO whilst he sits at his laptop looking at J simple like that
42:31
then we can start generating the video with A3 right people back in the day they used to say you get what you pay for the free version is limited or you
42:38
have to get the premium versions to get results and I would say that's just corporate marketing not reality the real
42:44
problem is not free versus paid the real problem is knowing what the tools actually do versus believe in marketing
42:49
claims like Google's free tier of Gemini 3 handles more business automation than most entrepreneurs will ever need and no
42:55
lm is is free there are certain limits but most people are not going to hit them studio is the same you can use it
43:01
for free Gemini's free tier gives you massive context windows and multimodal capabilities and so you're not really
43:06
hitting tool limitations quite often people are hitting knowledge limitations there's a big difference so most people
43:12
upgrade to pay blance before they even use like 10% of the free features and they're buying more tools to avoid the
43:17
learning of the ones on they already have. And what I'd recommend is like you stop buying new subscriptions, master the free tools first and then if you
43:23
actually hit limitations, then you can move on to consider it paid upgrades. All right, so we'll wait for that to
43:29
load then you see how that works. Right? Now let's talk about the old way versus the new way. Let's say for example with
43:34
content creation, right? The old way was for example you'd write content in Google Docs manually copy for chat GPT
43:40
export to video editor manually create videos thumbnails in upload and schedule all that separately track everything in
43:45
nasty spreadsheets and it would take like four to six hours per piece of content right whereas for example the
43:50
new way is that you can write once in Gemini 3 you can generate the podcast audio notebook you can create video
43:56
content in Vera 3 you can generate images directly inside Gemini and everything is connected inside Google's
44:01
ecosystem and like a complete content package maybe create six different pieces of content. It's going to take
44:06
you like 30 to 45 minutes maximum. The same with client on boarding. You manually send welcome emails, copy paste
44:12
questionnaires, schedule calls one by one, create custom proposals, send contracts separately, follow up manually, and that takes about 2 to
44:18
three hours per client. Right? That was the old way. The new way is like you can build an intake tool inside AI studio.
44:24
The client enters their information, system processes it, will welcome emails, etc. You integrate that with calendar and then everything is tracked
44:30
in one place and that takes about 10 minutes per client. So you can see how easy it is to switch to this new way and how much more powerful it is. Wait, so
44:36
he's real? I thought he was an AI avatar. I was on a podcast yesterday and both people were like, "Are you real or is this like the is this the AI avatar
44:44
of Julian?" Zoo says, "I really enjoy your content. Thank you so much. It's really good to like positivity on the live stream as well. Appreciate you."
44:50
And then Jason says, "I'm using free Gemini to its max and at some point, yeah, at some point you might want to
44:56
upgrade, but you don't need to, right? And the live is always real. It's always a real deal on the live streams." All right. So, you can see how easy it is to
45:02
build this stuff, how easy to use. If you go back to Google Gemini, now we have the video here, as we can see. I'm
45:08
just going to mute that, but you can see how we've got someone talking. This does have a voice over. You got the SEO charts on the laptop there. And how easy
45:14
was that to generate a video? Like, it's easier than ever. Now, the same with gems, right? So, inside gems, you can
45:20
build out like a custom trained automation that can create content whenever you need it, right? So, if you go to new gem over here, we're going to
45:26
accept that. And then inside here, we just explain what we want, right? So let's say for example we could create an
45:32
app that takes a resume and job description then provides a critique of the resume or we could analyze a meeting transcript and drafts an email with the
45:37
key takeaway. So let's click on that and then we'll enter. From here we can start building out the app. Right? This is way
45:43
better than most custom GBCs like build or claw projects for example cuz if you look at the UI it's not just building an
45:49
automation it's also building like the front end of it as well right so you can see here that we can just paste in a
45:54
meeting transcript right and then we can use this custom automation step by step to create the meeting transcript
46:01
generate the email content and then render the summary by email as well. Pretty simple and easy. Let me take an example from YouTube. You can consider
46:07
this a meeting in some ways, right? Let's say, for example, we could take this interview I did with Nate Hook.
46:12
Copy the transcript. Excel. Grab that. Go back to the gem that we have. Paste that in. Hit enter. And now it'll start
46:19
generating the email content based on the meeting transcript we created. And it's all linking within one single
46:25
ecosystem. And now it's beginning to generate as you can see. DJ says, "Honestly, I wasn't sure, but it's up to you cuz you stay on top of updates
46:31
better than most people. Love the content, man." Honestly, that's what I actually asked some of my best members inside the air profit board. why have
46:37
you stayed for 12 or 10 months since we launched? And they're all like because you stay on top of everything as soon as it comes out. So as soon as this is a
46:43
new live update, we create video about it and we just stay on top of everything. So for example, if you check out my YouTube channel, like there were
46:49
Gemma 4 rumors yesterday and kind of like tease from Google and we created a video about it within hours. The same
46:54
for example with the notebook updates that came out recently, dev tools, MCP,
47:00
etc. Anything that comes out, we try and cover it as soon as possible on our channel. So you see here we've got the medium breakdown, right? based on that
47:07
and then we've got that good to go, right? And then we can share that with people. Super easy. It's got the action
47:12
items separated right here. Key takeaways from the meeting and everything else, right? And it's written the email like you can see, right? So,
47:18
you can see how simple and easy this is to start generating email automations or meeting automations, whatever you want.
47:24
Right? DJ says it was easy to believe your AI cuz you're so quick. Yeah, I mean, I do these live streams every day,
47:30
so I think I've got pretty good at them at this point, but I'm sure I can get a little better, too. Amara says, "Very informative. Thanks for sharing. Happy
47:36
to tell. Thank you so much. And Jason Legend says, "Julian is the trail blazer. He's helped me so much. I
47:42
appreciate that." Thank you so much. All right. So, that's basically it. I've shown you exactly how to use, build apps
47:48
inside AI Studio, all sorts of types of content inside Notebook, how to edit,
47:53
create images, add generate videos, Gemini, and also how to, for example, automate inside Gems as well. So this is
48:01
gems which is the app builder which basically automates different processes for you based on what you type in right
48:07
we've got like an SEO content right it's all here as well and this is custom trade to be able to create content for
48:12
me right and if we click on edit over here we can actually edit the custom instructions for this particular tool describe it attach knowledge so we can
48:19
actually attach like personalized files the create better outputs for us based on what we want and just from here we're
48:24
good to go all right thanks for the informative sharing can Google AI studio vibes build a full stack web phone app.
48:31
So if you want to build a phone app, you would use Google's ecosystem again, but you can use Firebase for that. I actually have a lot of training inside
48:37
the air profit boarding for that. So if you type in Firebase at the top here and then you can see that we have a bunch of training on how to build apps with
48:43
Firebase, which is another tool from Google and you can build apps for free inside there as well. And then if you want to build full stack inside AI
48:49
studio, you just attach something like Superbase to whatever you build and then it can create the back end and front
48:55
end. But just be careful with security and all that sort of thing, right? You want to be careful when you build stuff out like that if you're trying to attach
49:00
a back end that's collecting people's data. So, always do your research on that. But yeah, you can see exactly how it is. DJ says, "After watching your
49:06
videos, I built a pretty simple but fun Unity app using step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting with Gemini. Shout out to you for taking
49:13
action." That is absolutely awesome. But yeah, that's what we've covered. Now, if you want to get the 30-day implementation road map, you can get
49:19
that inside the AI success lab, completely free. It shows you week one foundation, how to set up your core
49:24
systems. You can see it's got the action items here. So like day one, day two, day three etc. If you want to go off and implement this stuff, we also got week
49:31
two which is automation and building your first complete workflows. Then from here we have week three which is optimization. So refining and connecting
49:37
everything. And then week four which is scaling. So building your entire business system. So content client
49:42
business dashboards, training documentations, backup systems, team training preps, advanced prompt libraries, integration testing, right?
49:49
And also future planning too. So I've also given you a bunch of examples of what you can actually build and how much time it would save you by doing this.
49:56
So, for example, how to go from six to eight hours on content to doing this all inside 45 minutes, plus where to use it
50:01
and how to use it. So, you see some examples right there. And then also, I just want to talk you through like how you can get results with this and who's
50:08
winning with this. So, if you check out the AR profit boardroom, a lot of people say, Julian, it's great for you that you're getting that stuff, but what
50:14
about everyone else? You can see that inside the profit boardroom, people are winning and learning with this stuff all the time, right? People are just growing
50:20
and improving. So, for example, like Brianna was struggling with focus, right? And we all struggle with this when it comes to AI cuz there new AI
50:26
tools and new AI updates coming out every single day. Bruna who joined the air profitable boom. She was like thanks to the focus protocol which is something
50:32
we have inside the air profitable volume just that just helps you stay as focused as possible. Right then for example
50:38
we've got other stuff as well inside here. So let's have a look at some other wins. So for Vladimir published 10
50:45
Kindle books and 10 more titles to Gumroad. Shout out to Vladimir for taking action. I always see Vladimir's
50:50
wins and I'm like this guy is just on a different level. He's always publishing and creating awesome stuff. And you can see I personally respond to people as
50:56
well inside the buffer too. You can see made their first funny AI video and
51:02
started using Google Flow and Whisk recently to create a 63 second clip and actually shares it as well. And then you
51:07
can see for example Christina 7 days ago created her first YouTube short and she's already getting close to a,000
51:12
views. So like people are winning with this stuff as well. You can implement it. This isn't just me. These are like
51:18
real business owners building actual automation systems that actually help them. And we actually got over 106 pages
51:24
of testimonials for the AI profit as you can see here. So like all of these people winning and getting results like
51:30
you can see which is just awesome. That's what we like. So my main point here is these are people exactly where
51:35
you are right now. They were overwhelmed. They were using basic AI tools. They were not sure exactly how to automate their business. And they learn
51:41
the exact systems that I'm showing you today. They build their own automations. Now they have more time. Clients are less stress. Right now, what I recommend
51:48
right now in terms of action steps and homework is open up Gemini, start a conversation about one repetitive task
51:53
that you do constantly, ask Gemini to help you automate it, and then take what it gives you and test it out today. All
51:58
right? And then this week, set up a notebook alert with one piece of content, create your first gem with a
52:03
common task, explore AI Studio templates, test 3 with a simple video prompt, and connect Gemini to your
52:09
workspace. And then this month, just follow the 30-day road map that I gave, right? One day at a time. And another good piece of advice here is don't skip
52:16
ahead, right? Don't try to do everything at once. Just build it systematically and then post your progress inside the AR profit boardroom inside the win
52:22
section here to get help and just share what you're building. Ask questions, get feedback, see what other people are
52:27
automating, too. Because the community has literally thousands of business owners doing exactly what you're about
52:32
to do and you're not figuring this out alone. All right, so that's basically it. Right now, Google has handed you a
52:38
complete business automation system for free. Most people ignore it. They'll just keep paying for disconnected tools.
52:44
They'll keep copying and pasting between apps. They'll keep working crazy hour 50our work weeks wondering why they
52:49
can't scale. But you're different. You showed up on this live stream or this video. You've read this file. You're actually willing to learn. And the gap
52:55
between knowing these tools exist and actually using them to automate your business. That's where the opportunity
53:00
lives. Not in having these secret prompts, not in paying for expensive courses, in actually building the systems this week instead of next month.
53:07
Right? So start today, pick one tool, automate one task, see the result, and then do it again tomorrow. And that's how you build a one person business that
53:13
competes with teams of like over 10 people. All right. And these tools are ready. The system's working. The only question is whether you actually use it.
53:19
So, we've got some questions here. Leave your questions in the chat and I'll answer them after the end. But I want to talk you through what you get inside the
53:25
air profit board. Right. So, first of all, you get the daily AI coaching calls. I'm live inside the community all
53:31
the time and you can just jump on camera inside the coaching course as well. So, if you go inside the AI profit here, go
53:37
to the calendar, you can see all the coaching calls. We actually have four a week where you can just jump on live. It's myself and my team. So for example,
53:43
we also have a PhD trained specialist in AI, Dr. Jeff. On those calls, you can
53:49
get daily coaching support whilst you're building everything. All right? So most people give up at this point. They just go back to basic use and that their
53:56
dream of automation just stops. But if you add daily coaching support whilst building everything, would that help
54:01
you? Absolutely. I think and that's what you get inside the air profit board, right? You have two clear choices. You
54:06
can take what you've learned today and try and figure out loans, spend weeks testing, hit Roblox, wonder if you're doing it right, maybe succeed
54:12
eventually, maybe give up when it gets hard. Or choice number two is that you can join the AR profit boardroom right
54:18
now. You can get a 30% discount. You can get into the mastermind, start building today on the daily coaching calls. And
54:24
the difference is speed and certainty. Okay? Like alone, you might figure this out in 6 months. With daily coaching,
54:30
proven templates, active community support, you're building working systems this single week, right? We actually got
54:36
a challenge on right now for newcomers and everyone inside the boardroom to build your first AI automation and get
54:42
your first win within the next seven days. You can see 17 people have already joined the challenge. So if you want to join in with us, visit the air profit
54:48
boardroom link in the comments description and you get immediate access to the AI profit board training library with every Google ecosystem
54:54
implementation, all my best tools and templates from today's live stream, tons of other systems, the community growth
55:00
mastermind, and everything else. All right. Now, also what you get inside there is like the community growth playbook. So you'll see how I've scaled
55:06
a school community. If you actually type in school here, you'll get all the training for that inside the classroom as you can see. So all these different
55:11
trainings. So like how to scale your community. And this playbook is exactly how I've built the community out to
55:17
1,800 people school. You also get the Facebook domination system and it will show you how to automate content
55:22
creation with Google's AI and then distribute it across Facebook and Facebook ads and Facebook groups and everything else. You get the AI avatar
55:29
engine. The AI avatar engine is something that saves me four hours a day and it shows you how to create professional AI avatar videos for
55:36
content outreach and everything else, right? So, if you type in avatar here, you'll learn how to create AI avatar videos with this video tutorial and the
55:42
step-by-step procedure and all the information inside the classroom is unique and exclusive, right? So, you won't find it anywhere else and you can
55:48
get that inside the AI profit volume link in the comments in description. Now, let's see what questions we got
55:54
here. DJ says we already answered that. Please share some information about Gemini CLI. So that kind of goes outside
55:59
the scope, but if you type in the AR profiting Gemini CLI, you'll see all these different video tutorials,
56:05
including one recently updated from just a couple of weeks ago, right? So if you want to get the latest information on how to use this with action plans and
Building No-Code Apps in AI Studio
56:11
step-by-step procedures, you can get it inside the air profit board here. And you can see we actually date and update
56:17
the new updates inside here, right? So if you want to learn, for example, the newest stuff that's just come out, you can see even for the 13th of December,
56:23
we've added all this new information here. So it's all dated. It's all easy to go through as everyone else, right?
56:29
DJ says, "I think it was your video that had said I could share my Gemini Pro. Do you know if it shows on your account
56:35
that you have pro? I think you just check in your settings and you can see if you're on the pro or the normal plan." And then CTPT says, "I've got
56:41
eight books ready to launch into Amazon KDP. I'm just trying to figure out how to do the covers correctly." So, you can actually use Nana Banana for doing that.
56:47
We actually, if you like ebooks, we actually have a one-click ebook generator with NASN, as you can see, and
56:53
that shows you a full workflow on exactly how to go from like idea to generating a full notebook, launching it
56:59
on Google Docs, and then creating like ebooks in one click. And I actually have a video tutorial that walks you through it as well. All right, Amra says, "Got
57:05
it." Thank you. Awesome. All right. Google Anti-gravity Gemini 3.0 plus free
57:11
opus 4.5 is insane. Today, I'm going to show you how Google Gemini 3.0 Zero just
57:17
changed the game with their new anti-gravity feature and Claude Opus 4.5
57:23
is now completely free. These are the two most powerful AI tools right now and
57:28
they just got massive upgrades. By the end of this video, you'll know exactly what these tools can do and how to use
57:34
them. Google just dropped Gemini 3.0. This is their newest AI model and it's
57:40
got something they're calling anti-gravity. Now, before you think this is about physics or floating objects,
57:46
let me tell you what it actually does. It's a complete overhaul of how Gemini processes and generates images. The
57:52
speed is insane. The quality is better, and it can handle way more complex prompts than before. I'm talking about
57:58
prompts that are 500 words long, detailed descriptions, multiple objects, specific lighting, exact colors. Before,
58:05
if you gave Gemini a super long prompt, it would get confused. It would miss details. It would forget parts of what
58:11
you asked for. Now, with Gemini 3.0, you can throw everything at it, and it handles it perfectly. Here's what
58:17
changed under the hood. Google rebuilt the entire image processing system. They call it anti-gravity because it lifts
58:24
the weight off the model. Think about it like this. Old Gemini was carrying a backpack full of rocks while trying to
58:30
create images. New Gemini dropped the backpack. It's faster. It's cleaner. It processes your requests without slowing
58:36
down. The quality jump is massive, too. Images look more realistic. Colors are more accurate. Lighting is better.
58:43
Shadows make sense. Before you'd get weird artifacts in your images, random blobs, distorted faces, hands with six
58:49
fingers. Gemini 3.0 fixed most of that, not all of it. The speed improvement is wild. Old Gemini took about 30 seconds
58:56
to generate an image, sometimes longer if your prompt was complex. Gemini 3.0 does it in under 10 seconds. That's
59:03
three times faster. You can iterate way quicker now. Try one idea, don't like it, try another. You're not sitting
59:08
around waiting anymore. Now, if you want to dive even deeper into AI automation, I've got something special for you. I
59:14
run a community called the AI Profit Boardroom. The best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save
59:20
hundreds with AI automation. Learn how to save time and automate your business with AI tools. The link is in the
59:25
comments and description. It's at school.com/iprofitlab. Now, let's talk about Claude Opus 4.5.
59:33
This just went free, completely free. No catch. Anthropic decided to make their
59:38
most powerful model available to everyone. This is huge. Opus 4.5 is
59:43
their smartest model. Better than Sonnet, better than Haiku, and now you don't have to pay for it. What can Opus
59:49
4.5 do? Everything. Writing, coding, analysis, problem solving. It's got a
59:55
massive context window. That means it can remember way more information in a conversation. You can feed it entire
1:00:00
documents, whole code bases, long research papers, and it keeps track of everything. The writing quality on Opus
1:00:07
4.5 is insane. It doesn't sound like AI anymore. It sounds human, natural, conversational. You can ask it to write
1:00:13
in any style, formal, casual, technical, creative, and it nails it every time. Before you'd read AI writing and think,
1:00:20
"Yeah, that's obviously AI." With Opus 4.5, people can't tell the difference.
1:00:26
Coding got a massive upgrade, too. Opus 4.5 can write entire applications, not
1:00:31
just snippets, full programs. It understands complex logic. It can debug your code. It can explain what's wrong
1:00:38
and fix it. I've seen people build entire web apps with just OPUS 4.5. No other tools needed. Here's the thing
1:00:45
that makes Opus 4.5 different from other AI models. It actually thinks through
1:00:50
problems. Most AI just spits out answers fast. Opus 4.5 takes its time. It breaks
1:00:56
down the problem. It considers different approaches. It gives you the best solution, not just the first solution.
1:01:01
The analysis capabilities are next level. You can feed it data, spreadsheets, reports, research papers,
1:01:08
and it finds patterns you'd miss. It connects dots. It gives you insights that would take hours to figure out
1:01:14
manually. I'm talking about deep analysis here, not surface level stuff. Now, let me tell you why having both of
1:01:20
these tools is powerful. Gemini 3.0 is your image powerhouse. Opus 4.5 is your
1:01:27
text and logic powerhouse. together they cover everything. Need to create visual
1:01:32
content? Use Gemini. Need to write something complex or solve a problem? Use Opus. Need both. Use both. Here's a
1:01:38
real world example. Say you're creating content for a website. You need images, you need text, you need everything to
1:01:44
match. Before you'd use one AI for images, another for text. They wouldn't match. The style would be off. The tone
1:01:50
would be different. Now, you can use Gemini 3.0 for all your images. Same
1:01:55
style, same quality. Then use Opus 4.5 for all your text. Everything flows
1:02:00
together. The fact that Opus 4.5 is free changes everything. Before you had to
1:02:05
pay monthly, now anyone can use it. Students, creators, small teams, everyone gets access to the best AI
1:02:12
writing and coding tool available. That's massive. Let me talk about the technical side for a second. Gemini 3.0
1:02:19
runs on Google's TPUv5 chips. These are customuilt for AI workloads, way faster
1:02:25
than regular GPUs. That's part of why the speed improved so much. Google optimized everything from the ground up.
1:02:31
Opus 4.5 uses a different architecture. Anthropic built it to be safer and more
1:02:36
aligned. That means it's less likely to make things up. It's more accurate. It follows instructions better and it
1:02:41
refuses fewer requests because it actually understands context better. Both tools have been trained on massive
1:02:47
data sets. We're talking about trillions of parameters. Gemini 3.0 was trained on
1:02:52
images, text, video, and audio. It's truly multimodal. Opus 4.5 focuses on
1:02:58
text and code, but goes way deeper. Quality over quantity. Here's what you need to know about using Gemini 3.0
1:03:05
effectively. Be specific with your prompts. The more detail you give, the better, the better your output will be.
1:03:12
Use the anti-gravity feature to your advantage. This means you can ask for complex scenes, multiple objects,
1:03:18
different angles, specific perspectives. Don't hold back. Push the limits. See what it can do. For Opus 4.5, structure
1:03:25
matters. When you ask it to do something complex, break it down. Give it steps. Say, first analyze this, then do that,
1:03:32
then conclude with this. It follows instructions perfectly. When you're clear, use the long context window.
1:03:38
Don't try to cram everything into short prompts. Give it all the information it needs. Background, context, examples.
1:03:44
The more you feed it, the better it performs. Let's talk about what makes these updates different from previous releases. Most AI updates are
1:03:52
incremental, slightly better, slightly faster. These updates are transformational. Gemini 3.0 isn't just
1:03:58
a bit better than Gemini 2.0. It's a completely different beast. The anti-gravity system is a fundamental
1:04:04
redesign. Same with Opus 4.5 going free. This isn't just a price change. It's a
1:04:10
strategic move that opens up the most powerful AI model to millions of people who couldn't afford it before. That's
1:04:16
going to accelerate AI adoption like crazy. The competition between AI companies is heating up. Google wants to
1:04:23
dominate image generation. Anthropic wants to be the go-to for writing and coding. Open AI is somewhere in the
1:04:29
middle trying to do everything. The this competition is good for us. It means faster updates, better features, lower
1:04:34
prices. Here's something most people don't realize. These AI models get better every single day. They don't just
1:04:40
update once every few months. The training continues. The finetuning continues every time you use them.
1:04:45
You're using a slightly better version than yesterday. That's wild. Gemini 3.0 learns from every image it generates. If
1:04:52
something doesn't look right, the feedback goes back into the system. Next time it creates something similar, it's
1:04:58
better. This continuous improvement is built into the core system. Opus 4.5
1:05:03
does the same thing with text and code. Every conversation makes it smarter. Every correction teaches it something
1:05:08
new. This isn't static technology. It's living technology that evolves. Let me address something important. Some people
1:05:14
worry about AI replacing jobs. That's not what's happening here. These tools amplify what you can do. They don't
1:05:20
replace you. Think about it. Before calculators, people did math by hand. Calculators didn't replace
1:05:26
mathematicians. They made math faster and more accessible. Same thing here. Gemini 3.0 doesn't replace designers. It
1:05:33
lets designers work faster and try more ideas. Opus 4.5 doesn't replace writers.
1:05:38
It lets writers focus on the creative parts while handling the repetitive stuff. The people who win with AI are
1:05:44
the ones who learn how to use it effectively. That's why understanding these tools matters. Not just knowing
1:05:50
they exist. Actually knowing how to use them. Now, if you want to dive even deeper into AI automation, I've got
1:05:56
something special for you. I run a community called the AI Profit Boardroom. The best place to scale your
1:06:02
business, get more customers, and save hundreds with AI automation. Learn how to save time and automate your business.
1:06:08
The link is in the comments and description. It's at school.com/iprofitlab. And if you want the full process, SOPs
1:06:15
and 100 plus a I use cases like this one. Join the AI success lab. Links in
1:06:20
the comments and description. You'll get all the video notes from there, plus access to our community of 38,000
1:06:26
members who are crushing it with AI. Google just dropped a massive wave of updates this week, and I'm going to be
1:06:32
breaking down every single one of them for you live. We're talking about, for example, Gen Tabs, a brand new tool that
1:06:39
has been created by Gemini that lets you remix your open browser tabs and create
1:06:45
custom web apps using Gemini 3. Also have Pomellle animate turns your content into onbrand animations powered by 3.1.
1:06:54
We also have mixboard upgrades including presentations, new file types, and multiboard projects. Doppel fashion
1:07:00
updates you can try on looks with a personalized discovery feed. D's AI Asian, which now surfaces task and
1:07:05
automates fixes before you even ask. Deep research API, which is Google's most advanced research capabilities, now
1:07:12
available for developers and family sharing, so you can actually share your accounts. Plus, you've got Google Disco,
1:07:18
which is a place to test and discover the next AI features for the web. So, there's loads of new updates from
1:07:23
Google, absolutely leading the race when it comes to AI, and we'll be breaking down a few of them today. If anyone has
1:07:29
any questions as you go along, feel free to ask. If you want to get the video notes from today, feel free to get it. Link inside the comments description.
1:07:35
This is free inside the AI success lab. You get a free community with 38,000 people. And if you go to the class from
1:07:42
over here and then you're going to go to new AI automations. You can see that we have the links to everything broken down
1:07:48
beautifully. So let's start with some of these and we'll break down exactly which one, you know, what FM means, how to use
1:07:54
them, etc. All the announcements. So you can see for example this is a new announcement from Google on disco and
1:08:00
gen tabs essentially you can join the wait list for it now it's a new discovery vehicle from Google labs to
1:08:06
test ideas for the future of the web. What does that even mean my friends? All right I'm glad you asked. So we're going
1:08:12
to play this video and we'll have a little cheeky look at Google Disco. So basically it's using Gen Tabs. It looks
1:08:17
a little bit like Gen Spark to be honest when you have a look at it and you can generate tabs and little web apps based
1:08:23
on your open examples, right? So you can open up a gen tab here as you can see play this. You can create your own web
1:08:30
apps between whatever you're looking at. Basically, it will just turn the open tabs you have into like web apps as you
1:08:37
can see, right? Pretty crazy stuff. That is essentially the future of the internet. And you can see here they've
1:08:43
said the Google disco you know the with the web is a vast collection of
1:08:48
applications and information making it an incredible machine for discovery and learning. Yet as our online tasks have
1:08:54
grown more complex we all felt the frustration of juggling dozens of open tabs you all know what it feels like to
1:09:00
have open tab anxiety. I believe and we believe the web itself has the opportunity to adapt to this complexity
Google Disco & Gen Tabs Overview
1:09:06
right which is Google disco. So you can basically navigate through your tasks. You can remix different things. Let's
1:09:12
have a look at this one. So you can turn your tab into a custom app. So it says, "I'm taking a road trip from Boston to
1:09:19
Burlington next month. We want to go sledding and do other wintry things. Can
1:09:24
you help me plan?" And then you hit plan. And from here you just wait for it to load. And then you can actually turn
1:09:30
this into a web app as you can see, right? Basically like an animated version of Google search. Much more
1:09:35
interesting. You can see it comes up with a bunch of ideas right here. and then looks through the tabs. As you can see, looks really cool. And you can use
1:09:42
this to build apps like this. So, someone's actually started searching
1:09:47
about the solar system. So, they've got tabs open about explore solar system scope and eyes on the universe. And then
1:09:54
Google Disco has actually remix into an app, right, using the information from the tabs. So, it just makes everything
1:09:59
way more interactive. You can sign up for the waiting list, I believe. So, you can join the waiting list at
1:10:05
labs.google/ Google SLD disco and then join the weight list over here as you
1:10:11
can see right you just put in your details as you can see get used to it honestly if it was me I'd probably just
1:10:16
copy and paste that into chat GPT and then copy and paste that into the app but it looks really cool and yeah but
1:10:23
absolutely amazing update right there so we're going to run through the rest but here's what I would say Google have just
1:10:30
released like a dozen updates all at once genome anime mixboard doc Apple,
1:10:36
Jules, Disco, Deep Research, API, the list keeps going. And I felt this kind of wave of panic hit me because
1:10:44
essentially, you know that feeling when you're trying to keep up with the AI and it feels like you're drinking from a fire hose. I've been teaching AI for
1:10:50
years now. I've helped literally thousands of people inside the AI profit board learn this stuff. And even I felt
1:10:55
overwhelmed for a second. And then I took a deep breath, made some tea, and did what I always do, which is I went
1:11:01
through every update one by one, tested them, checked them out, researched them, broke them, figured out what actually
1:11:06
works. And here's what I've realized is like these updates aren't random. They all connect together like puzzle pieces.
1:11:13
Gen tabs, for example, and Google Disco, they let you build custom apps from your browser tabs. But Pomelli, for example,
1:11:19
turn your content into animations. Mixboard creates presentations. Jules automates your coding task. And when you
1:11:25
put them all together, you basically got an entire content and automation system that runs itself. And that's what I'm
1:11:30
showing you today. All right. So, we're going to keep running through and we'll take a look at some of these other ones.
1:11:36
Let's take a look what else we've got here. So, the next one that's on the
1:11:41
list is Pomelli. So, Pomelly, if you're not familiar with it, I've actually covered a few videos on it and test it
1:11:47
out live. Let's take a look here. So you can see here it says create onbrand marketing content for your business with
1:11:53
Pomelli and then you can see the examples how it works right here and we
1:11:59
actually got this video that breaks down exactly how it works step by step. But essentially if we pull this up you can
1:12:04
see how it works. So you can kind of like animate different parts of your tools and that sort of thing right. So
1:12:10
if you want to go and use pome just go to labs.google.com/pomelly/about.
1:12:16
then you can go to get started and you can get access right there if you're in the right country. So, if you're in the right region. Now, if you've never used
1:12:23
this before, I do have some videos on it and show you exactly how it works. That is looking crazy on the replay. So, I'm
1:12:29
going to close that down. But essentially, you can see how it works step by step here. All right. So,
1:12:34
essentially, it was great for creating visuals before, but now what you can do is you can actually animate anything
1:12:41
with it. So like product shots, text layouts, infographics, brand scenes, social posts. And the reason this
1:12:46
matters is like you don't need to manually edit anything. You got no crazy rendering chaos. And also it's going to
1:12:52
help you scale and move faster. So I would recommend this if you are a creator, an agency, a brand, an
1:12:58
educator, then mele is going to be super powerful as well. The other one that I've not even mentioned on the list and
1:13:05
has had some big updates is Notebook LM as well. I've actually just created a brand new training on notebookm if you
1:13:12
want to check it out. JJ says, "Watching from the Philippines, bro. Good to see you here. Thanks for joining, sir." And
1:13:18
if you want to check out Notebook LM, you can see an example right here. Actually, this morning I used a deep research API to just come up with a
1:13:25
bunch of sources and then create like a custom automation that knows everything
1:13:30
that's out there on the web about creating a school community, right? And so, it's just an example of how you can
1:13:36
use it. And so you can create these like custom trained automation and then you can generate for example like an infographic based on the information you
1:13:42
trade on right for example what you can do here is you can select deep research then you can say what you want to
1:13:48
research so for example let's say school churn rates or how to improve school
1:13:53
churn rates right basically community churn rates you can plug that into the automation here and then you can
1:14:00
automatically find sources across web that will help you train up the automation in the middle so that you can
1:14:06
create infog graphics or slide decks and that sort of thing. If you're on the ultra plan right now, this isn't free,
1:14:11
but if you get it inside the ultra plan, you can actually, for example, automate slide decks, infographics, flashcards,
1:14:17
etc., and you can automate them without the watermark. Now, you can still use this for free if you want, but you're
1:14:24
just going to have a watermark on the things that you create. But if you want to use it with Ultra, then you actually
1:14:30
be able to remove the watermarks as well. All right. So, some people say I
1:14:35
need to be technical to use these new tools. My belief is that Google built these tools for normal people who just
1:14:41
want results, right? And here's the thing, like Google didn't build gen tabs for developers. They built it for people
1:14:46
who just want to remix their browser tabs into useful apps without writing code. You literally describe what you
1:14:51
want in plain English and that's it. But Thomas Edison, the guy invented the light bulb, failed over a thousand times
1:14:56
before he got it right. You know what he said? I've not failed. I've just found 1,000 ways that won't work. And Edison
1:15:02
wasn't a scientist. He was a tinkerer. He tried stuff until it worked. And that's exactly how these new tools work, right? So, if you're using these new AI
1:15:08
updates from Google, you try things. You describe what you want. The AI figures out the technical stuff. And the old way
1:15:14
required you to learn coding, hire developers to watch 47 tutorials before you could build anything. The new way,
1:15:20
you just talk to it like a friend, right? So, if we go inside here, we're like, okay, how can I improve my AI
1:15:26
profit boardroom community churn rates? It's going to use the sources that we've
1:15:32
plugged in on the left hand side to start creating that. As you can see now, whilst we're waiting for the outputs
1:15:37
from that, we've actually got the infographic here, which we'll check in a second, the flash cards as well, and the slide deck. But some of people going to
1:15:44
say there's too many updates. I just can't keep up. And here's the thing that I would say is you only need to master three to four tools that actually matter
1:15:50
for your business. So, you know, Bruce Lee said something that changed how I think about this forever. He said, "I
1:15:55
fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000
1:16:01
times." You don't need to master every single Google update. You just need to master the ones that actually move the needle for your specific business. And
1:16:07
if you're creating content, focus on PL and mixboard. If you're doing research, focus on deep research, API, or use
1:16:14
notebooklet. If you're building automations, focus on jewels. Pick your three to four tools, go deep, and just
1:16:19
ignore the rest. That's what I'd recommend. So, if we have a look here, we've got the infographic as you can see. So, it's talking about the leaky
1:16:26
bug here, the monthly churn rate benchmarks, which I know are correct because I've been researching that recently. You can see here some of the
1:16:33
immediate wins and how to improve the communities. And it's pretty amazing what you can do with this stuff, right?
1:16:39
And so, that has just created a beautiful infographic that brings down the 8020 of what we need to learn. And we did it in just one click and a bunch
1:16:45
of deep research, right? We just click research that. Okay, click that. Boom. We've got a beautiful infographic that's
1:16:51
ready to go. So he's pretty awesome some of this stuff, right? The next one is Nano Banana in Mixboard, right? So you
1:16:59
can now create presentations based on your boards powered by Banana Pro, our latest Gemini image model. So for
1:17:05
example here, and by the way, if you're not using Nana Banana Pro, you got to check it out. It's by far the best AI
1:17:11
update and it's the easiest to use. One thing that used to put me off mid Journey is it was annoying to use. This is just like the simplest, easiest way
1:17:18
to use everything, right? So you can see here how simple it is to use this stuff. You just go in, click it, etc. Okay, so
1:17:25
if you want to get access, you just go to labs.google.com/mixboard/welcome.
1:17:31
And then depending on where you are, you can get access to this stuff. Chris Stan says, "Notebook LM is great. Let's hope
1:17:37
Google offer more tiers and only pro and ultra so I don't have to pay $250 to use 600 courses per notebook. We'll be
1:17:43
willing." Yeah, like it's not for everyone, right? I think the main thing with that is like if you're a business
1:17:48
it probably makes sense. If you're not a business probably doesn't make sense, right? And that's the way that I would look at it. It's like okay depends what
1:17:54
you're getting out of it. What's the leverage you're getting out of this stuff? So mixboard you can see here is powered by Nana Banana as you can see.
1:18:00
See you can create a new project. Let's have a look at this. Kind of looks a little bit like a myro board. So it's
1:18:06
loading the example board here. I don't think anyone's even talked about Google Mixboard, but it's pretty cool what you
1:18:11
can do with it. Let's try this out. So you can see here we've got a mix board based on this. So we asked for like cozy
1:18:19
full living room party ideas and then it's given us a bunch of ideas as you can see right now. You can actually drag
1:18:27
this across. So you can zoom out, move it around, etc. And then you can get full decoration inspiration, ask mix for
1:18:34
variations, ask it to change things, reimagine your living room, right? Pretty amazing. And it's all doing that.
1:18:39
It's all powered through something called Nano Banana, which is their latest update. Now, some people are also
1:18:46
going to say, "I'm already behind. Everyone else has figured this stuff out." But these tools are brand new. We're all starting from zero. So, listen
1:18:52
to me carefully. Like, Gentaps launched this week. Pomeate launched this week.
1:18:58
The deep research API launched this week. Nobody has years of experience with these because they didn't exist
1:19:05
until a few days ago. Muhammad Ali, he didn't become the greatest boxer because he started earlier than everyone else.
1:19:10
He became the greatest because he trained smarter, believed himself when nobody else did. And he said, "I am the
1:19:17
greatest." I said that even before I knew I was, right? And right now today, you have the exact same starting point as everyone else on the planet. The
1:19:23
question is, what are you going to do with that? So, when you're using these tools, like just test them out, see what
1:19:29
you think, right? You can see how simple and easy it is to do and how to get ideas and how to refine your ideas and
1:19:34
that sort of thing, right? So, here's another one. This is birds with googly eyes. By the way, if you actually want
1:19:40
like business use cases for stuff like this, check out the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description. This
1:19:46
is my personal community where I basically have built a community of winners, serious AI builders, and you
1:19:54
can see that inside the community here, you can connect with 1,800 serious builders in AI. You can also go into the
1:20:01
classroom and get all of my best playbooks, trainings, and systems for growing with AI. For example, if you
1:20:08
want to know how I get so many leads, customers, and sales with AI, all of my best systems are inside this section
1:20:15
right here, the AI playbook. And then also inside the calendar, we do four coaching calls a week. So, you can jump
1:20:20
on with a PhD scientist, ask any questions you have, get help and support if you need it. And that's all inside
1:20:25
the a profit boardroom link in the comments and the description, my friends. All right. So, if you go back
1:20:31
to notebook, it's a mixboard here. You can see some examples. So, birds with googly eyes. And then it's these are
1:20:37
pretty cool. I didn't even Are these real or are these like I don't know. I don't know. But I'm loving it. I'm
1:20:42
loving it. So, let's go back here and we'll try a new project. Can also turn
1:20:48
it into a presentation. Let's have a look here. So, we can explore some ideas. We can make something fun. Plan a
1:20:54
party. Imagine new ideas. Interesting. So, you can add like different elements and then create new stuff. Make
1:20:59
something fun. All right. Let's I don't know if you can actually What would I do
1:21:04
with this? Let's just say okay, something like that. All right. And we'll create something like that and
1:21:11
we'll see how that goes. The eagle is not real. Julian, a client friend asked
1:21:16
me how to use Gemini for job search. The best I could offer were third party head hunters. Yeah. So, the way that I would
1:21:22
do it if I was searching, if I was using Gemini for job searches here, I'd just go in, right? And I'd be like, "Okay,
1:21:28
let's say I'm an SEO. I'm an SEO expert looking for a full-time role remotely.
1:21:35
Find me some job posts from the last week, something like that, right? And
1:21:40
then we can go into Gemini and just go directly inside here and it will actually search job boards for you." So
1:21:46
you can see here it's actually looking through job boards, exploring LinkedIn, Indeed, Glass Door, etc., and finding
1:21:51
remote work for you, right? Then it's made a bunch of opportunities, found
1:21:57
some ideas. It's tailored it to me and who I am. Obviously, I run an SEO agency, so I'm not looking for this, but
1:22:03
this is what I would do in this situation. You got a bunch of different jobs that have just popped up, as you
1:22:09
can see. And then we can say, okay, now give me the links. If you wanted to fill
1:22:16
out the applications themselves, you just copy the job information into Gemini, say fill this out, personalize
1:22:22
to me, and then you can actually like automate answering the job board and the job application itself, which is
1:22:28
probably the most useful part. So that's how I would handle it. You see how easy that was. But yeah, so we've covered a
1:22:34
bunch of cool stuff right there inside all of these Gemini updates. Here's what
1:22:39
I would say is the old way versus the new way, right? So, here's how things used to work compared to how they work
1:22:45
now. So, for example, with content creation, the old way was like spending hours writing scripts, filming, editing,
1:22:50
and creating graphics manually. The new way is you can use Pomelli to generate on brand and animate it automatically
1:22:56
3.1. By the way, if you want the notes from today, just get it inside the AI success lab link in the comments description. It's completely free.
1:23:02
Research. The old way you open like 47 tabs to get lost in rabbit holes. You forget what you're even looking for. the
1:23:07
new ways you use the deep research API or Gentaps automatically synthesize information from multiple sources. Let's
1:23:13
just have a look at this. I want to pull this up. This new API from Google. I
1:23:19
don't know if it's going to be available on open router as well. Let's have a look here. If we type in deep research,
1:23:24
it doesn't seem to be available inside open router. Let's have a look inside A Studio. So, if we go home, go where to
1:23:31
build, we'll select the model type. Let's see if we can find it. Uh, so you
1:23:36
can code it with JavaScript and then Python and you just use the Google search and URL context tool, but you
1:23:43
would use this Python to to start using it and steering it and nothing else. So I think it's more for developers.
1:23:48
Honestly, it looks a little bit more technical, but that's basically how you can use it. Yeah, the same with like building tools, right? The old way was
1:23:54
like hiring a developer. You wait weeks, you hope it works. The new way is like you use something like Gen Tabs or remix
1:24:00
your browser tabs into custom apps instantly or you can just go into AI Studio and build something that way with
1:24:05
task management. The old way was like manually review everything, catch problems after they happen. The new way is like Jules surfaces tasks and
1:24:10
automates fixes before you even have to ask. And for presentations, like the old way was spending hours in PowerPoint
1:24:16
dragging around. The new way is mixboard can actually create presentations automatically, multiple file types and
1:24:22
multiple board projects. Or you can use Notebook LM for that, too. So, that's basically it. Now, what I've also done
1:24:27
is created a 30-day blueprint to automating your business with Google's new AI tools. And basically, this is a
1:24:34
step-by-step way that you can start using all of these tools, as you can
1:24:39
see, and implementing and learning them. So, a lot of people feel like they're behind or they don't know how to use them. You can just follow this 30-day
1:24:46
action plan, and then you're good to go. You can master this stuff. We're also giving you a bunch of prompts inside here as well. And yeah, that's basically
1:24:52
it. The other thing that I would say is if you're wondering, okay, people actually winning with this stuff. What I
1:24:58
can do at this point is just show you some real proof. These are real solarreneurs just like you who have learned the systems and implemented
1:25:04
them. So if you go inside the air profit bom here you can see all these people just winning with this stuff here. For example, Steven just posted 7 minutes
1:25:10
ago. Going to give that shout out to Steven said he'd never heard of NA10 and he came to this community and started to
1:25:17
have his mind expanded massively in the last couple of weeks. He's developed a workflow that will save his business 3
1:25:23
to four hours per week, which is huge. And that's 10% of his time freed up. Imagine if you got 10% of your time
1:25:29
back, right? How amazing is that? So that's Stephen. He literally just posted that seven minutes ago. I'm going to say
1:25:34
well done. Well done. This is amazing. Shout out to Stephen. This is inside the AI profitable border. And then you see
1:25:40
here the next flow he developed was uploading videos he had made in Ptory and adding the title description author
1:25:46
by Gemini and then adding two links to his website and the description rotating those and uploading everything to
1:25:52
YouTube. Right. So you can see all this crazy stuff, right? And he said so big shout out to training and information in
1:25:57
the air volume. It's been a steep learning curve but a very satisfying learning curve and explaining the same
1:26:02
that you cannot teach an old dog new tricks and he said this is interesting as well. So we were talking about Gemini today. One of the things that really did
1:26:09
help was Julian Goldie post on the updated deep think version of Gemini a me challenges I was having with NA10
1:26:15
workflows that Kimmy Chat tuby and even GenSpark were not cutting the mustard with. Another project that I've started
1:26:22
to do a little bit of work on is rank and rank websites. And I punched in some preliminary ideas into Gemini Deepthink
1:26:28
research for this model. Now popped a very detailed 15-page report. Right. Boom. That's pretty awesome. And he
1:26:33
said, "So thank you one and all who contribute to this community. It has been awesome. Shout out. That couldn't
1:26:39
have been better timing. I didn't plan that, but Steven, shout out to you. That is absolutely amazing." You can see
1:26:45
here. What else we got? Steve Light made an app with his website that lets you generate random art images from museum
1:26:51
APIs. Pretty cool. You've got David Nielson who just launched a new SEO tool
1:26:57
on Product Hunt and he created it with Google Anti-Gravity after one of my videos, right? So, you can see here like
1:27:04
people are creating full SAS tools with this stuff using Google Gemini and a combination of anti-gravity as well and
1:27:09
then coding their own tools and releasing them on product. Like it's pretty crazy. That is absolutely insane.
1:27:15
Yeah, stuff like this just like it makes my day. I love seeing people win. But you can see all these testimonials here.
1:27:21
And if you're wondering, okay, are these the only testimonials Julian Goldie has about the aircraft boarding? If you actually go inside this document here,
1:27:27
you can see that we have over 103 pages of testimonials from people winning just
1:27:32
like this, right? I've never built a community that's had such an amazing response. Like all these testimonials
1:27:39
here, all the people winning. Mulo, hey Julian, so happy I joined the air reward. Darren, wow man, that's so
1:27:45
exciting and it's a credit to you and all of your wonderful training support. Paris, I wake up and see what gold you
1:27:52
drop into my AI stack the very next morning. What else you got? Steve Light smashing it. Justin Hen avatar is
1:28:00
amazing. Like these testimonials, there's 103 pages of this stuff inside the air prof. It's not just me that's
1:28:06
winning with AI. Like loads of people are absolutely crushing with this stuff. And if you want to be part of that, just
1:28:11
join the air profitable board, right? It's absolutely amazing what we got here. What else we got inside the
1:28:17
comments? Maybe an off topic question, but is there a way to make an app? A notebook LM notebook. Yeah, so you can
1:28:24
actually use if you want to make an app, you just start using the API instead. So you can go into here. I think it's I
1:28:32
think there's something like notebook API. I remember seeing it a while back. Yes, you can use it with the enterprise
1:28:38
version. They did have something else a while back as well. I want to see this. Let me have a look inside Google AI
1:28:44
studio. Bear in mind like all the same functionality as well from notebookm you get inside the build section. So if you
1:28:51
want to automate presentations you can. If you want to automate podcasts you can right videos etc. You can do all that
1:28:57
inside AI studio. So in some ways you don't even need notebookm API if you
1:29:02
can't find it. And sporter says used AI studio winds surf netify all learned from you. I have a ton of new tools due
1:29:08
to you. Thank you very much sir. I'm also an AI profit boarding member. I can confirm that it's a great place. Thanks for referring to the API. Happy to tell
1:29:15
and thanks so much for joining today spoilers. So that's pretty much it from me. I've shown you proof of this work.
1:29:20
I've given you action. I would recommend posting inside the air profit boardroom community. That's your homework today is join the air profit boardroom. Tell us
1:29:27
what Google tools you using. What's think one thing you're going to automate this week? What belief did we help you
1:29:32
break today? And I read every single post because this community is there to support you. So feel free to get that
1:29:38
inside the AI profit boardroom. The final thing that I was going to say is that if you do join the AI profit
1:29:43
boardroom today, as you can see inside the classroom and everything else you get, this is where I put everything. So every live stream replay, every set of
1:29:49
notes, every prompt, every automation, every system for my build when Google drops updates like they did this week, I break them down inside the boarding
1:29:55
before anyone else. So you get all my live stream replays, complete video notes for every training, my personal product libraries, automation templates,
1:30:03
you can copy direct access to me in the community, weekly live calls, and you also get access to the SEO lead circle.
1:30:08
So you get my private SEO training for free to learn how to get your content ranking on Google, my best backing
1:30:14
strategies, the exact systems to use my SEO agency, traffic generation. Top of that, you get the December bonus stack,
1:30:20
which is the school playbook, my complete system for building and growing a school community. Inside there you get
1:30:25
my Facebook domination playbook as well, my AI avatar machine and engine for
1:30:31
creating AI powered content and systems that work for you around the clock and VIP coaching as well. Right? So you get direct access to me for implementation
1:30:38
and help. Top of that I'm starting a private mastermind for people want to build serious school communities and
1:30:43
this mastermind has never been public before and after this the only way in will be like a separate application process. Right. So interestingly I
1:30:49
actually checked my Gemini before and I don't think I've got access if I check down here. I can't see 3.0 available
1:30:56
inside, but I think it's just currently rolling out cuz it's brand new. And also, I can get access on Open Routter
1:31:02
instead. So, if I go to models over here, you can actually get access to Gemini 3.0 Pro Preview inside the model
1:31:09
section. So, go to Open Routi and then go to Gemini 3.0 preview over here. All
1:31:14
right. And then you can start using it inside the chat. Now, if you're wondering, okay, how does it perform?
1:31:20
So, it's still got a million context token window. These are the prices for using the API and then you can see how
1:31:25
it works over here. Some of the top apps using this. It's available inside like client, root code, you can code with it,
1:31:30
agent zero, etc. We're going to be testing it out together. So, if you also want a free guide on how to use Google
1:31:37
Gemini and you know how to basically save time and scale your business with
1:31:42
Google Gemini 3.0, I actually put together a whole guide and prompt inside the AI success lab link in the comments
1:31:48
description completely free if you want to get access to that. and we're going to start testing this out in a second. So, let's have a look at the updates and
1:31:55
what it means and how it works. So, you can see here they've said nearly 2 years ago we kicked off the Gemini era, one of
1:32:01
our biggest scientific and product endeavors ever taken as a company. Since then, it's been incredible to see how
1:32:07
much people love it. AI overviews now have 2 billion users every month, which is pretty insane to be fair. 2 billion
1:32:14
users. You can see the Gemini app surpasses 650 million users per month. more than 70% of their cloud customers
1:32:20
also use AI, right? So, the uptake of Google Gemini has been absolutely wild. I think a lot of people watching this
1:32:27
love it already, but Google Gemini 3.0 has just come out, of course, and they said to date, we're taking another big
1:32:33
step on the path toward AGI and releasing Gemini 3. It's the best model in the world for multimodal
1:32:39
understanding, a most powerful agent vibe coding model yet, delivering rich visuals, deeper interactivity, all built
1:32:45
on a foundation of the art reasoning. Now, they've said we're beginning the Gemini 3 era. And I'm just going to put
1:32:51
a poll inside the chat there. And yeah, you can see. So, we're beginning the Google Gemini 3 era by releasing Gemini
1:32:58
3.3 Pro in preview and making it available today across a suite of Google products. So, you can use it in your daily life to learn, build, and plan
1:33:05
anything. Also introducing Gemini 3 Deep Think, an enhanced reason model that
1:33:11
pushes Gemini performance further. So, this is going to be interesting and fun to test. Let's keep scrolling down now.
1:33:16
What else we got? State of the art reasoning. You can see the benchmarks here. You see how it performs. So you got humanity's last exam. Let's take a
1:33:23
look at this. All right. So Gemini 3.0 Pro. How does it perform? So humanity's last exam compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro.
1:33:31
It's almost dull, isn't it? Compared to Claude Sonic 4.5 as well, it's absolutely destroying it. And then even
1:33:37
compar GP 5.1 is not very good. But when you compare these directly, you can see that Gemini 3 Pro is just so much better
1:33:44
than 5.1 as well. And that is a new release, right? That only came out last week or something like that. So the
1:33:50
steps up and development here is pretty advanced. You can see the evaluation methodology over here as well. So you
1:33:56
can see how it's been tested and that sort of thing. But basically it outperforms all the other models right
1:34:01
now. Easy win says I'm noticing it's way more creative at coming up with new stuff now. So that's going to be fun.
1:34:07
What else we got here? Gemini 3.0 also brings a new depth of nuance. Blah blah blah. Let's try this. Test this out.
1:34:14
Just going to have a look at this. All right. Shader inspired by plasma flows confinement in the Taco Mac. Add orbit
1:34:20
controls. Return a single HTML page. I have no idea what that means, but why not test it out? All right. So, we're
1:34:26
going to go to Gemini 3.0 Pro here. We'll go in the chat. Then, we're going to paste in that image and just say,
1:34:32
"Type out." I imagine it's probably quite slow whilst it's rolling out to everyone and whilst everyone's testing
1:34:38
it, but let's see. And then EasyW says, "Why are they scared of releasing deep
1:34:43
think? Is it really capable of doing a lot? I think they just have to be careful like from a legal perspective
1:34:48
when they release this sort of stuff and also they don't want to go too fast. Right. So, we've got the prompt here and
1:34:54
then we're going to click on interactive app and we'll paste in that right now. Now, we've got the HTML being coded. So,
1:34:59
version one is reasoning first and then it will code out in a second. So, we'll see how that performs. Soundtrack
1:35:05
intensity. Oh, that's interesting. So, I think you can add soundtracks on top of whatever you create. Then you got Gemini
1:35:10
3 deep think which I've not seen yet but basically this is another new model that's coming out soon. Basically they
1:35:16
say this pushes the boundaries of intelligence even further delivering a step change in Gemini's reasoning and
1:35:23
multimodal understanding capabilities right to solve even more complex problems. This is still generating.
1:35:28
Okay, we'll take a look at that in a sec. And then you can see Gemini 3 deep think over here. So already Gemini 3 Pro
1:35:35
was doing pretty well. But now you can see that compared to that, Deep Think is superior in pretty much every way. It
1:35:42
wins on humanity's last exam versus Gemini Claude, GPT5, and GPT 5.1. And
1:35:47
then also the same for Gemini 3 deep thinking on GPQA scientific knowledge.
1:35:53
So you see it beats Gemini 3 Pro, 2.5 Pro, Sonet, GPT 5 Pro, and also GPT 5.1.
1:36:01
And the same for ARC. So deep think is going to be insane. But to be honest, I didn't really use deep think the
1:36:07
previous model. Why is this? Let's go to the preview here because it's failed. It's failed on the API anyway. So there's a lot of hype about it, but it's
1:36:14
not code did anything good here, right? And that's from the actual demo. Maybe it's rolling out on open router and it's
1:36:20
not very good when everyone's using it, but SC. So I'm going to try something else now. This is something that even
1:36:25
Gemini struggled with before. So all the models pretty much failed at this, but we'll try this now. So I'm going to say
1:36:31
create a PS5 controller in HTML. just go with something simpler cuz it it failed on that one before and we'll see what we
Gemini 3 Pro Benchmarks & Performance
1:36:37
get. So, it's starting to code that right now. We'll see how it does. So, let's map it out. Let's keep going
1:36:42
through. See what else we got here. Okay, it might be better in AI Studio actually, just thinking about it. Maybe we'll try in AI Studio in a sec. So,
1:36:48
let's do it over here. Let's see what we got. So, we got model. If you go to AIS.google.com,
1:36:53
it's available here, too. So, you can select the model and then you can choose Gemini 3.0 Pro or Pro Preview. So, we go
1:37:00
with that one. That's the default. And then if we go inside here and we click on build, we can start building apps
1:37:05
with it directly too. Bear in mind there are limits on this. So you get a certain quot. So just be careful with that. But
1:37:10
it will start coding here. So you can see it's coded on the left. Pretty simple and easy to use. Whilst we're waiting for that to load, we can also
1:37:16
build stuff inside Nent too. It is quite slow on the API for sure. Cool thing is if you build directly inside AF Studio,
1:37:24
you can also use the APIs from Bay 3 and stuff like that as well. So now we've got the game. I'm just going to mute
1:37:29
that. And then we're going to use WSAD to move and space to fire. Let's try this out. Still not that great, is it?
1:37:36
So, this is the game from Gemini 3.0 Pro. I'm pretty sure if we put that
1:37:42
exact same prompt into Claude, we'd get a better output. So, let's try it on Claude, for example. Then, we'll plug
1:37:47
this in. So, we got AI Studio and Gemini 3 over here. And then we have Claude over here. I just have a feeling that
1:37:53
Claude's going to do a better job if there like. Now, if we wanted to build an AI agent with Gemini 3.0 Pro, we
1:38:00
should be able to do that here. So, if we type in AI agent over here, chat model and then if we type in, you can do
1:38:07
this two ways. You could use Google Gemini chat model or you could use open router. So, you can just plug in router
1:38:13
over here and then select for example Gemini 3. Pro. If not, you should be able to use let's have a look. Yeah,
1:38:20
that's so you got Gemini Pro latest Gemini Pro Preview. There you go. So, you can actually plug in your account
1:38:26
here. Add your API key, select model, and then you can use Gemini 3. Pro inside a 102 using that. Mark says,
1:38:33
"Love Gemini 3, but it didn't blow my mind." LOL. I would agree. I think so far from what I've seen, not that
1:38:39
impressed. This is much nicer now, actually. Look at that. That's pretty cool. Did it just improve the prompt?
1:38:45
Okay, let's let's have a look here. So, Claude, this same sort of thing. This is pretty nice, but it's 2D, isn't it? It's
1:38:51
pretty flat and it's pretty basic. If we compare the game of this versus, and
1:38:56
bear in mind, we asked for a 3D spaceship game, right? And also, yeah, it's only in 2D. But if we compare this
1:39:02
versus Google AI Studio, so let's reboot this. This is more crazy and interesting, right? So, I would say
1:39:08
Gemini 3 did do a much better job than Claude for that output. And then if we have a look at AI Studio, this one was
1:39:15
not so great, right? This was super basic and didn't work at all. And then if you want to use it instead shown you how to do it. So you just connect Google
1:39:21
Gemini into the chat and then select 3.0 preview. Sim Wave vibes. Yeah, I would
1:39:27
agree with that. And then we got the PS5 controller over here as well. It's pretty realistic, isn't it? And then you
1:39:32
can press enter to use a cross or PS5 button. Press space arrows uses a D-pad
1:39:37
and then WD uses the sticks. All right. Like you can see that's pretty cool. If we compare that to Claude, I actually
1:39:44
tested this out yesterday. So, if we go back to chats now and then we have a look at the PS5 controller from Claude.
1:39:50
Pretty bad, right? So, that's the Gemini 3.0 example. Pretty good. You can use
1:39:55
it. It's very interactive. It has a nice little guide on how to use it below. And then everything is connected and created together. But then if we have a look at
1:40:01
Claude's output is pretty bad, right? So, I would say that Gemini 3 Pro is on
1:40:06
a nude level compared to Claude seems a lot more powerful, a lot better, etc. So, let's have a look what people are
1:40:12
saying on X as well. So if we scroll through Sam Wman, the CEO of opening up
1:40:18
said, "Congrats to Google on J3. Looks like a great model. Pretty nice." What else we got here? The Sun PGI, the CEO
1:40:25
of Google said it's the best model in the world for multimodal understanding and our most powerful agent plus vibe
1:40:30
coded model yet. For sure that's got to be with AI, right? That's been written with AI. I'm pretty sure 1.2 million
1:40:36
views on that. Pretty insane. What else we got here? Gemini 3 Pro, our most intelligent model. Yeah. So to reasoning
1:40:42
1501 elo on LM score for sure like Google are just leading the race aren't they? Mark says it's crazy that every
1:40:49
day I came here and there's something new that comes out. What's coming next? Any leaks you know of? I actually heard
1:40:54
that for example Nano Banana is coming out soon. There's going to be a new update for that. So that's going to be fun. And the diva says Gemini 3.0
1:41:02
handling the logic whilst my neurons are buffering for sure. Why don't I have it yet? I have the pro subscription plan
1:41:09
too. I don't have it. But again, like you can get access inside AI studio, right? So if you go to AI studio, you
1:41:15
can get access here. It's currently rolling out. Bear in mind, it's brand new, right? So if I check my models, I actually do have three pro now. So it
1:41:22
says 3 pro, which is great. But I think it'll be rolling out to some people. I think that wasn't there before when I checked. So just be aware of that. You
1:41:28
can check by having a look at the dropown. And then for mine, for example, it says thinks through complex topics
1:41:33
with three pro. So make sure that we select thinking and then just double check is 3 pro. if you want to get access to this and you want to check if
1:41:40
you've got it. But I'm on the ultra plan as well. So maybe they roll out to people on the ultra plan first and then roll it out to everyone else later to
1:41:46
that's something else to be aware of. So any other tests that people want to see, I would be interested. Otherwise, what
1:41:51
I'm going to do is I'm going to go over to chat and say knowing what you know about me, give me some app useful but
1:41:59
simple app suggestions and we'll do some more tests. For some reason chat 5.1 calls me mate every single time. Now is
1:42:06
anyone disrespect? So, productivity in focus. For some reason, I asked for like app suggestions to build as well to
1:42:12
build myself. And then it just gives me other people's apps. Okay, great. Thank you. Chat GPT 5.1. So, let's switch over
1:42:19
now. Okay, let's try this one. Build a web app that lets me write my top three priorities each morning. Mark's done.
1:42:25
Saves my entries and local story so I can see yesterday's list. Okay, we'll go over here and then we're going to go to Gemini. Plug that in and we'll see what
1:42:31
we get back. In the meantime, we're going to go to Claude as well. Gymnast 3 already beat Claude in terms of the
1:42:36
space game and also the PS5 controller and HTML. Chat GBT sucks. Not going to
1:42:42
lie. I don't even use it anymore. Yeah, the last seven days. It's just been so bad. It's crazy. And Salami Nugget is
1:42:48
looking for a AI girlfriend. Okay. Top B today. Top banter. Let's see what else we got here. What else are people
1:42:54
building with this? There's some people were saying like there's not a massive step up versus the previous ones.
1:42:59
Anti-gravity new agentic first software IDE. That's going to be interesting.
1:43:05
Some people saying it is going to replace cursor for example. Have a look at this. I'm not even going to use Chad
1:43:10
GB anymore. We're going to use Gemini 3. Probably say tell me everything I need to know about Google's new anti-gravity
1:43:18
IDA plus give me a full guide on it and we'll come back to that in a sec. Anti-gravity is already out. You should
1:43:24
try it. I might do another video on that. I'm actually going to tell my team of editors to do a video on that. So
1:43:29
Google just released anti-gravity, a major new agentic ID designed to complete directly with tools like cursor
1:43:34
and winds. That is interesting. They're just dominating, aren't they Google? Like they're too they're too good and
1:43:40
they're everywhere as well. Google Antigraity is an AI assisted development environment unlike traditional IDs that
1:43:46
simply add an AI chat box to the side. Antigraity is built from the ground up to be agent. That means you don't just ask it to write code snippet by snippet.
1:43:52
You act as an architect. Okay, so it's like cursor or whatever. Then you got three services. So agent manager editor
1:43:58
browser integration. Ah that's cool. So you can test it out inside your chrome as well. It's using Gemini 3 pro as a
1:44:05
core model whereas cursor and wind surf I think they have new models than that. I don't think they rely solely on that
1:44:11
but yeah it's been a while since I used cursor and wind surf simply because the demand for it on YouTube was not there.
1:44:17
Tell you that for free. All right. So we're going to go over to our app now. Let's put in the priorities. Then we can
1:44:22
takeick it off. Okay. So it's coding everything really nicely here. super easy as well to use as the editors to
1:44:28
explain the difference between using anti-gravity versus an AI studio. Okay, let's try that. So, just to be clear
1:44:34
here like AI studio is where you can code and build apps directly here and then you've also got anti-gravity which
1:44:40
is a new IDE from Google using Gemini 3 Pro which is an agentic kind of
1:44:46
alternative and competitor to cursor and wind surf. So, let's have a look. So, AI
1:44:51
studio is a playground. Think of this like a sketchbook or science lab. You go here to talk to the AI and test ideas.
1:44:56
You ask questions like write a poem about a cat, whatever. And you can build apps inside there. You can also use vis.
1:45:02
It's like testing a new pen on a scrap of paper to see if the income is pretty. Okay, I like that. Google anti-gravity
1:45:07
is like the robot construction team. This is like a full workshop of robot helmets, right? So you go here to build
1:45:12
like bigger things. I assume it's local as well when you're using anti-gravity. And then if you want to just get like
1:45:18
quick apps built, you would use AI Studio. But if you want to make like a real app or a real game or something
1:45:23
bigger, then you would use anti-gravity. Basically, that's the difference. So, I'm loving Gemini 3. I think it's pretty
1:45:29
good so far. I had a tough start, but it's actually getting a lot better now, I think, once you figure out. Let's see what else we can do here. So, I'm going
1:45:35
to say, okay, create a Let's go to your apps and see if we can build something here. Create new app. And then we should
1:45:41
be able to use Google search data as well. So if you use Google search data in Gemini 3 preview then I'm going to
1:45:46
say okay create based on the topic I give you create an amazing guide that's
1:45:52
beautifully formatted text only leave emojis third grade language with
1:45:58
everything I'd need to know in that particular topic it will be a lead magnet for my videos Gemini 3 pro
1:46:07
ultimate guide topic will change you time search the web for the latest info turn that into an amazing ing guide plus
1:46:14
giveaway that people would love. Let's try and build that out. So, basically what we're doing is building like a lead
1:46:19
magnet generation machine using the Gemini 3.0 app builder. So, we're using
1:46:25
Gemini 3.0 preview as you can see over here. And then we should be able to build that app. And then if you want to get access to this, I'll put it inside
1:46:30
the A profit board. So, if you go to classroom, then we shall go to SAP updates over here. And I'll plug this in
1:46:37
over here. So, let's see what we got here. And inside the poll, we've had 33 votes for whether it's insane or not
1:46:43
insane. All right, so you can see the poll here and 79% have said it's insane.
1:46:48
So if you see insane in the title, we've all agreed the 8020 have agreed that it is insane. So let's go to the app we
1:46:57
built. Where is it now? Over here. Right. So what do you want to teach? Enter a topic and we'll search a web to build the ultimate beginner's guide for
1:47:03
you. So I'm going to put Gemini 3.0 Pro inside here. Hit generate. It's based on live web data, so it's using Google's
1:47:09
API. I like the UI of this. It looks super nice. And then we've got the guide right
1:47:15
here. Pretty nice. I would just say improve the formatting. So, it has headings plus H2s, H3s, etc. Notate.
1:47:24
What else do we want to add inside there? Include 100 plus, 50 to 100 plus use cases/ tips. Add each guide. What
1:47:31
else do we want to add? I want to say tailor this to my audience, which is B2B. If it's about AI, include prompts.
1:47:39
Anything more useful. We can also save that as PDF. I really like that feature. Look at that. It should be about 1,000
1:47:44
words. Every sentence on a new line. Yeah, that'll do for now. All right, let's make those changes. So, you see
1:47:50
how easy it is to build an app now. And you can see that Gemini, but by the way, I've tried something similar with 2.5
1:47:56
Pro and it did create something really nice, but it doesn't look as good as that. I'm actually going to pull up the
1:48:01
example of that so you can see and compare them side by side. Here's an example of another tool I've built for live streams, but this is with Gemini
1:48:08
2.5 Pro, right? So, you'll see a big difference in the UI between them. So, this is Gemini 2.5 Pro. Just doesn't
1:48:14
look quite as nice as this one, which looks and feels more like a SAS product, right? You've basically built a website
1:48:20
and an app in one single click. And this is on a live stream when there's a lot of pressure to get it right and it can easily mess up and stuff like that. So,
1:48:27
let's click Gemini 3.0 Pro over here. Powered by 2.5 Flash and Google Search.
1:48:33
If you want to I'm going to publish this now, but if you want to get access to that, I'm going to put the link to the
1:48:39
lead magnet app here. So that's inside the AR profitable border. And if you want to get a full guide on this, I'll put it inside the proper bum as well.
1:48:45
There you go. There we go. I still don't like the way it's not broken up. So there's no line spaces or anything like that. There's no H2 tags. That's the
1:48:52
only thing that I would say. Let's save it as PDF and see what we get. Doesn't seem to work for the PDF option. Okay.
1:48:57
So there's still some bugs in this. Like it's not perfect by any means. So I' say make sure you add nice line spacing plus
1:49:04
the headings etc. super messy and take a screenshot of this. Then we'll go back over to the chat here. Paste that in and
1:49:11
just say see example attached is super messy plus hard to use. Can you improve
1:49:17
the UI of the guide that you create so it looks more beautiful. Also the save
1:49:22
as PDF option doesn't work. So it's making less mistakes but it's still not perfect. Don't expect I saw a lot of
1:49:28
stuff on X about like how you can oneshot with this and all that sort of stuff, but if you're building something
1:49:33
a bit more complex, it requires more understanding. It's going to take a bit more time, right? You see us thinking
1:49:38
and creating that. But if you want access to that app and the guide, just go to the profit board classroom and
1:49:44
then go down to new SAP updates November 2020 onwards and you'll see the guide at
1:49:51
the top over here. Right, there you go. I want to see what they've done with Oh, this is interesting. So you can get
1:49:56
Google anti-gravity experience liftoff with the next generation IDE. You can download it for Mac OS. I'm on a Mac
1:50:01
Mini, so I don't know if that's going to be able to handle it and the live stream at the same time, but we can try and test it. See if the live stream breaks.
1:50:07
And then Google Antiggravity is our development platform evolving the ID into the first agent first era. Agent
1:50:13
first experience built for developers for the agent first era. Okay, there's not actually that much information about
1:50:19
it, how it works, but let's go to the downloads here and we shall install it. Let's grab that. Plug that in. That
1:50:24
should be installed now. Let's open up anti-gravity. What's going on here? Just copying it. All right, this should be
1:50:29
fun. Excellent for that. Okay, we'll try out the guide as well in the background. And in the meantime, we'll go over to anti-gravity and see what we got. Open
1:50:35
up. If the camera starts lagging and stuff like that, just let me know because typically IDEs, they make things
1:50:41
a little bit. So, we'll see what we get in a sec. Elsa, good to see you here. Elsa's a profit board member, so I
1:50:47
appreciate you reposting the stream. Thank you very much. Thanks for sharing. Super kind. And then we got different options for the theme types. So, we got
1:50:53
dark, Tokyo night, light, and solarized light. I think I prefer dark out of all of them. Let's try Tokyo. I do Tokyo.
Anti-gravity IDE: Cursor Alternative
1:50:59
I'm a big fan. I went there a couple of months ago. Beautiful place. So, we got agent-driven development, agent assisted
1:51:05
development, review driven development, and custom configuration. I'm going to go with agent assisted cuz that's a recommended option and I do not know how
1:51:12
to code. Then, we can install extensions. We've got options between Vim and normal key bindings and install.
1:51:18
I don't know what any of that means, I'll be honest with you. So, I'm going to just sign into Google in the background and we just open that up.
1:51:23
Agree to the terms to use. Click okay. Log in here. And then here's what anti-gravity looks like. All right. So,
1:51:29
here's anti-gravity. You can see it now, right? So, you can see like this is the ID. And then we can open up a folder,
1:51:36
open up agent manager or client repository. Feels exactly like Visual Studio Code or cursor to be honest. And
1:51:42
then inside here, we can start using the different models. Now, you can select a model here. So, you can choose this
1:51:47
interesting as well. Look at this. Well, this is Google's ID, but you can use GTO OSS Claude Sonet, Gemini 3 Pro or Gemini
1:51:54
3 Pro high, right? So, you got two different options between low and high when it comes to coding. And then if we
1:52:00
go inside the chat here, we can say, okay, code out an app for any suggestions, people. If not, I'm just
1:52:06
going to say research student Goldie and plan out a beautiful landing page for
1:52:13
his AI profit boardroom community which helps people save time, get coaching and
1:52:18
help and unlimited technical support on AI automation. Plus has a community of 1,700 people. Plus comes with Julian's
1:52:27
private automations and put third grade language direct response style copy. Beautiful. Let's see what we get back
1:52:32
from them. Mark says nice happy mate. This was your suggestion. So that's the beauty of live streams, isn't it? You
1:52:38
can do these together. And if you like live streams inside the air profit boarding, we do four live coaching calls
1:52:43
a week. So you can ask any questions you have live there, watch cool stuff being built, etc. H story says makes Gemini 3
1:52:50
makes much less mistakes overall. Awesome. Okay, so it's planned it now. Said I need an active. So I'm going to
1:52:55
Can I just get it to run this for me? There we go. And then if we switch to fast now and I've said okay, please go
1:53:01
ahead. Hey, Historia says anti-gravity is wind surf on. Yeah, let's check it out. It's going to be interesting to see
1:53:07
how this performs. When should I use fast, slow, and high, etc. So, I'm going to test out fast. Now, I think for
1:53:13
building something really complex there, for building something really complex, then you want to use like high. If it's
1:53:19
just something basic like a web page, I'm pretty sure you could get away with fast. So, depends what you're using for,
1:53:24
but yeah, I think from what I've seen, fast is enough. And then if you're building something crazy, then of course go with high. But I think you'll
1:53:31
probably have a credit limit which means that you can't use too much unless you're going crazy. I'm actually going
1:53:37
to switch to low in a sec just to test it out. So I'm using fast and high right now and then I'll switch to low in a
1:53:42
second. I just want to show you the difference. And mini PC tech a thanks so much. Says as usual Julian you are right
1:53:47
on top of things and keep us informed. Glad I subscribe to you here and on the a profitable. Appreciate you so much mini PC tech. That's super kind and I'm
1:53:54
glad you're enjoying the air profitable boardroom as well. That always makes me happy. I think we've got 96 pages of
1:54:00
testimonials like that inside the air profit boardroom and it's thanks to people I use. So really appreciate it.
1:54:05
Thank you. So let's keep going through now. Now the HTMs ready to go. I'm say okay run it. All right. So I think I've
1:54:10
got to set up a folder. Let's try that now. New folder. Test trusty authors. Yes, trusty authors. I want to try that
1:54:16
again. So I'm going to use low now. Fast build a website for Julian Goldies perfect boarding link to page. What else
1:54:23
we want to do? Probably paste in some information about it and we'll plug in this. So we have a lot of training on how we do that Mark inside the air
1:54:28
profit boardroom as well. So if you want to learn how we grew that group so fast check out the training inside the air
1:54:34
profit boardroom. If you just type in school once you're in the air profit boardroom you'll see all the training on school and how we did that. Agent
1:54:40
execution terminated due to error provider overload. Ah there we go. I'm not that impressed to be honest but so
1:54:46
far it's totally failed. Let's try and switch to I'm going to try again. We use Gemini 3 Pro high instead. I was using
1:54:53
low before and it totally failed cuz the provider was overloaded. I can imagine like so many people are using this right
1:54:58
now. So, it's trying again. Pair ranks. Sorry I'm late. Yeah. Do you know what? Shout out to pair ranks cuz yesterday
1:55:05
they messaged me and said I'm pretty sure 3.0 pros is coming out soon or like within next 24 hours etc. And then it
1:55:12
came out. So, shout out to you. That's pretty amazing. Wow. Some crazy leaks right there. So, pair ranks has all the
1:55:18
information. So, I'm going to accept the changes on this. Now, we can open this. I'm going to say open up. You know, it's funny that Gemini 3 Pro high is working,
1:55:26
but low isn't. Why would it do that? All right. So, we've got to set up browser use. I'm going to set that up now. It's
1:55:31
going to open up a browser. You probably can't see this. So, I'm going to just share my whole screen here. So, what you
1:55:36
can see here is I'm installing the extension for anti-gravity. Let's add that extension. Now, I've just got to
1:55:42
sign into Chrome. There we go. Boom. Look at that. Beautiful. Wow. That's so cool. That looks awesome. All right. As
1:55:47
you can see here, it's taken all the information that I gave it and then it links through to the AR profit boardroom
1:55:53
page, the sales page for it. So, let's say someone was an affiliate for the AR profit boardroom. They could easily set up a page inside the anti-gravity ID,
1:56:01
create a beautiful landing page like this. It's got all the information and then goes through to their affiliate link and then they can link to that from
1:56:06
whatever videos you clip on YouTube, etc. And you see here like the super nice, it's got all this information
1:56:12
about the AR profit boardroom, our double guarantee and then the link. The only thing I would say here is you want to add a bit more information and copy
1:56:18
to the page. But it's pretty easy to do that because you can go back to the ID here and say okay. Now fill out the page
1:56:24
with more information about its vision, benefits, story, who we are, why you
1:56:30
should sign up, social proof, etc. Right? And that should start coding out now. However, you can see again we've
1:56:36
got that provider overload error here. So just be aware that a lot of people
1:56:41
are using this and you're going to have to switch between models quite often. I always see this happen with tray as well. You have to switch between the
1:56:47
models. You have to test different things out, etc. It it doesn't always work perfectly, but it's looking cool. So, let's go back to the IDE. We'll
1:56:53
switch to say okay again. There we go. So, it's editing the HTML now. See what
1:56:59
we get back. And there we go. We've got another error. So, here's what I would say. And it's edited the page as well to
1:57:04
be even worse. Okay. The output was pretty cool from anti-gravity, but because it's brand new and because loads
1:57:10
of people are using it and testing it right now, it's super super slow and seems to really struggle right there.
1:57:16
Gemini's new model training could come as soon as mid December. Okay, nice. Nice. So, you let me know what you
1:57:22
think. Overall, I would say he's pretty good. I'm excited to see what anti-gravity can do once it's not overloaded with people testing it. But
1:57:29
yeah, I've shown you basically how to use Google Gemini 3 Pro to build apps inside AR Studio. how to create apps
1:57:36
inside the Gemini. How to use it on open router. How to use it inside the IDE as well. And also some of the pros and the
1:57:41
cons of using this. TK says, "Good morning, Legend. Good to see you here, Tick. Thanks for joining." So far, it's
1:57:47
been a lot better than Claude for the PS5 controller HTML test, which is another of Pair Ranks HTML test. So,
1:57:53
thanks for that. Pair Ranks is an absolute legend. And when Gemini 3 deep thing comes out, it's going to be wild,
1:58:00
isn't it? Things going to get mad. Absolutely mad. A lot of people say all of Google's marketing as well is saying
1:58:06
it's basically leading to AGI, but the benchmarks are just look at this from Jeff Dean. Look at the comparisons in
1:58:13
the benchmarks here. Gemini 3 Pro is just destroying 2.5, Claude 4.5 Sonet
1:58:18
and GPT 5.1. So again, like Gemini have just really established themselves as the best in the world for doing this
1:58:23
stuff. Histori says Open has a lot of catching up to do. I would agree. A lot of catching up to do, let's be honest.
1:58:29
And you can see Gemini 3 Pro is now number one across all major leaderboards on LM Marina 2. So if we pull this up,
1:58:36
we can see the differences here. Gemini 3 Pro is now number one across all major leaderboards. Number one in text,
1:58:41
vision, and webdev, number one in coding, massive gains over 2.5. They've absolutely crushed it and I've proven
1:58:46
that it's pretty good today. So I'm loving it. So thanks so much for watching. If you want to get access to the full guide on Google Gemini, go to
1:58:53
the classroom inside the arrit link in the comments description or just go to arprofit.com and then from there you're
1:59:00
going to scroll down and go to SAP updates November 2025. You'll find the details on Google Gemini 3.0 app over
1:59:07
here and inside here you can scroll down. You got the full app, lots of different prompts, the app that I built.
1:59:12
This also comes with all the latest updates and everything else that I've published recently as well and all my best systems etc. And then inside the
1:59:18
classroom, we literally update this every single day, right? So you can see here, we're probably the only community in the world for AI that updates their
1:59:25
teachings and their trainings every single day. Like you can see inside the school classroom. Now inside the
1:59:31
community here, you can see all of our latest posts, competitions, etc. that are running. Lots of cool stuff going on. And then also inside the classroom,
1:59:38
you'll get access to all my best trainings on, for example, the six week automation masterass where you can learn
1:59:44
AI automation from scratch. The playbook that comes with all my best systems for learning AI and all my best tutorials,
1:59:50
etc. and shorts and everything else, AI avatar videos. You've also got meions on lead genen and social media, right? So,
1:59:57
you can see all these different lead generation and social media automations with video tutorials and step-by-step
2:00:02
prompts, etc. And then inside here as well, if you want to learn 10, we've got all our best templates and workflows. We
2:00:08
have the agency course on how to land clients, how to get clients based on what's helped me scale my agency. And
2:00:14
additionally inside here, we have Q&A call recordings. The Q&A call recordings are crazy. Like you can see a whole year
2:00:21
of call recordings here. So you can jump on them, ask any questions you have, etc. And then finally, we have the AICL
2:00:28
automation section and the YouTube AI course as well. So if you want to know how I for example create AI videos, how
2:00:34
I come up with the topics, how I grew my channel to millions of views per month, I teach it all inside the AI profit boarding and then we also have four
2:00:41
weekly coaching calls. So you can jump on the coaching calls, ask any questions you have, get help, get support, get live technical support, etc. and ask any
2:00:48
questions plus connect with the community, right? So feel free to get that link in the comments description to the AI profit border. We also have if
2:00:54
you're interested in SEO link in the description again, but we have a Black Friday sale for our SEO services here.
2:01:00
It's backed by a 7-day guarantee. You can see all the details of this right here on the page, including what you
2:01:05
get, the strategy, etc. And you can order directly online, right? So, you don't even have to jump on a call. I
2:01:10
know like most people, they actually, for me personally, I don't want to call like before I try out a service, I just
2:01:15
want to order online. And so you can switch between these packages. Choose which one you want. Put in the coupon code Black Friday. Hit apply and then
2:01:23
you can see that you'll save 20% with the Black Friday code which is for a limited time only. And if you order
2:01:28
online, you can get access to that SEO service right there and then. So thanks very much for watching. Rank says, "Did
2:01:33
you try the PS5 test with Gemini 3?" Yes, I did. And Gemini 3 absolutely
2:01:40
destroyed everyone else when it came to that. Tick says, "I wasn't exactly thrilled that using BF in AR studio now
2:01:46
requires a API paid." Yeah, that is a little bit annoying. If you want to get a free one though, just Google Opal. And
2:01:51
if you can't get access to that, DM me inside profitable and we'll show you a workar around to get access to that. Chat GPT 5.2 just dropped. Google fired
2:01:59
back with Gemini 3. Open AAI called a code red. Google put AI in every product they own. This is the biggest AI battle
2:02:06
we've ever seen. And I tested both to see which one actually wins. Let's start with the big question everyone's asking.
2:02:13
Which AI is actually better? Here's the truth. It depends on what you need, but I'm going to break down exactly when to
2:02:19
use each one so you never waste time on the wrong tool again. Chat GPT 5.2 just
2:02:24
launched and it's a direct response to Google. Open AAI literally declared a code red. That's how serious the
2:02:31
competition got. They had to move fast. They had to match Gemini's power. And they did something smart. They gave us
2:02:36
three versions. Instant for quick stuff, thinking for deeper work, and pro for the complex problems that need serious
2:02:42
brain power. Now, here's what makes Chat GPT 5.2 different, but the reasoning got way better. We're talking about better
2:02:48
problem solving, better coding, better data analysis. Everything that requires deep thinking got an upgrade and the
2:02:55
long context handling is insane now. You can throw entire documents at it and it actually understands everything, not
2:03:01
just the first few pages, the whole thing. But here's where it gets interesting. Chat GPT 5.2 to handles
2:03:07
tool use way better now. What does that mean? It means you can have it work with spreadsheets, create presentations,
2:03:13
manage complex workflows. It's not just answering questions anymore. It's doing actual work for you. The kind of work
2:03:19
that used to take hours. And the safety improvements are real. Open AI learned from all the weird outputs people were
2:03:26
getting before. Now it's more reliable, more consistent, less likely to give you something completely off the wall. Wow.
2:03:32
That matters when you're using this for real business stuff. So that's chat GPT 5.2, but what about Gemini 3? Google
2:03:39
came in swinging hard, really hard. And they did something OpenAI can't match. They put Gemini everywhere. It's in
2:03:45
search. It's in Gmail. It's in Chrome. It's in maps. Every Google product you use has Gemini built right in. That's a
2:03:52
massive advantage. Gemini 3 is truly multimodal. Not just text, not just images. We're talking text, images,
2:03:59
audio, and video. It can generate videos through their VO model. It can understand audio. It processes
2:04:05
everything at once. That's the real power here. One AI that handles every type of content you throw at it. And
2:04:11
Google added something called deep think mode. This is for the power users, the people who need advanced reasoning and
2:04:17
multi-step problem solving. It's similar to chat GPT's thinking mode, but it's built into the Google ecosystem. So, if
2:04:24
you're already using Google Workspace, it just works with everything you do. The visual features got crazy good, too.
2:04:30
Gemini can help you shop. It can organize your inbox. It can give you dynamic visual outputs. It's not just
2:04:35
answering questions. It's actively helping you get stuff done in your daily life. And because it's connected to
2:04:41
Google search and always has the most current information. That's huge. And if you're finding this valuable, you need
2:04:47
to check out the AI profit boardroom. This is where I show you exactly how to use tools like ChatGpt 5.2 and Google
2:04:55
Gemini 3 to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with AI automation. These AI
2:05:01
models can transform how you work, but only if you know the right strategies and workflows to implement them
2:05:07
effectively. Link is in the description. Now, let me show you the real differences. I tested both with the same
2:05:12
prompts, real world stuff you'd actually use, and the results were eyeopening. First test was planning a week. I asked
2:05:18
both to create a balanced routine with a work hours, fitness, meals, study time, and social time. Had to be realistic,
2:05:25
not some perfect schedule nobody could follow. Chat GPT 5.2 2 gave me a super structured plan. Everything was
2:05:31
organized perfectly. Time blocks were precise. The logic was solid. It thought through every detail. But here's the
2:05:37
thing. It felt a bit robotic, like a productivity machine made. It still useful though. Gemini 3 gave me
2:05:43
something different, more flexible, more human. It understood that life isn't perfectly scheduled. It left buffer
2:05:49
time. It suggested using Google Calendar to sync everything. It even pulled in some real world suggestions based on
2:05:55
current trends. That integration with Google products showed up immediately. Second test was a meal planner. Create a
2:06:01
healthy weekly meal plan for a family of four. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Had to be realistic and
2:06:07
organized. This is where things got interesting. Really interesting. Chat GPT 5.2 nailed the structure. Beautiful
2:06:13
meal plan. Everything was organized by day. Nutritionally balanced. Variety across the week. Portions made sense.
2:06:19
Still incredibly useful for planning though. Gemini 3 went deeper. It gave me meal suggestions that felt more
2:06:25
practical and it connected to Google services to help with recipe ideas and cooking times. That real world
2:06:31
integration came through again. For daily life stuff, Gemini has an edge. Third test was coding. I asked both to
2:06:38
build a simple to-do list app, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Had to save tasks in local storage. Had to be clean and
2:06:44
functional. This is where chat GPT 5.2 destroyed it. Absolutely destroyed it. The code was perfect. Clean structure,
2:06:51
good comments, everything worked on the first try. No bugs, no weird quirks, just solid professional code. This is
2:06:57
what chat GPT was built for. Deep work, technical stuff, complex problem solving. Gemini 3 gave me working code,
2:07:04
too, but it wasn't as clean. The structure was a bit messier. It would work for a beginner, but if you're doing
2:07:09
serious development work, chat GBT 5.2 is the clear winner. Not even close.
2:07:14
Fourth test was visual. I uploaded a messy desk photo, asked both to suggest a reorganization layout and create a
2:07:21
visual sketch. This is where Gemini 3 flexed its multimodal muscles. It understood the image instantly, gave me
2:07:28
spatial planning suggestions, even generated a simple layout sketch. The visual creativity was impressive. Chat
2:07:34
GPT 5.2 could analyze the image, too. It gave good suggestions, but the visual output wasn't as strong. Gemini is built
2:07:42
for multimodal work from the ground up. When you need image understanding and visual creativity, Gemini wins. So,
2:07:48
here's what I learned. Chat GPT 5.2 is your deep work machine. You need complex reasoning, use Chat GPT. You need
2:07:55
professional coding, use Chat GBT. You need long document analysis, use Chat GPT. You need structured thinking for
2:08:02
business problems, use Chat GBT. It's the productivity powerhouse for knowledge work. Google Gemini free is
2:08:09
your daily life assistant. You need quick research with current info, use Gemini. You need multimodal work with
2:08:15
images and video, use Gemini. You need something integrated with all your Google apps, use Gemini. You need
2:08:20
practical everyday help, use Gemini. Here's my honest take. Don't pick one. Use both. I do. Chat GPT 5.2 for my
2:08:28
agency work, deep SEO strategy, content planning, technical problem solving,
2:08:34
client presentations, anything that needs serious brain power. Gemini 3 for everything else. quick research,
2:08:40
checking current trends, visual workshopping, email organization, daily tasks, all the stuff that's easier when
2:08:45
it's connected to Google. The real winner is you because for the first time, we have two AI systems that are
2:08:51
both incredible. Different strengths, different use cases, but both legitimately powerful competition made
2:08:57
both companies better. We get better tools, everyone wins. And if you want the full process, SOPs, and 100 plus AI
2:09:03
use cases like this one, join the AI success lab, links in the comments and description. and you'll get all the
2:09:09
video notes from there, plus access to our community of 38,000 members who are crushing it with AI. And if you're
2:09:15
finding this valuable, you need to check out the AI profit boardroom. This is where I show you exactly how to use
2:09:21
tools like Chat GPT 5.2 and Google Gemini 3 to scale your business, get
2:09:26
more customers, and save hundreds of hours with AI automation. These AI models can transform how you work, but
2:09:32
only if you know the right strategies and workflows to implement them effectively. link is in the description,
2:09:38
so comment below which one you're using, Team Chat, GPT, or Team Gemini. Google just dropped their biggest AI update
2:09:45
ever. Gemini 3 Pro is here, and it's insane. You can now make text, images,
Gemini 3 vs ChatGPT 5.2 Comparison
2:09:50
and videos in one place. No more jumping between five different tools. I'm going to show you exactly how to use it. This
2:09:57
is going to change everything. All right, let's talk about Gemini 3 Pro. This is Google's newest AI model, and it
2:10:03
just came out. is their smartest model ever. And here's what makes it different. Most AI tools do one thing.
2:10:09
Chat GPT does text. Midjourney does images. Runway does video. But Gemini 3
2:10:15
Pro connects everything. You can plan your content, make images, and create videos all in one workflow. That's huge.
2:10:22
And I'm going to show you exactly how to do this step by step. No fluff, no
2:10:27
complicated stuff, just the real workflow that actually works. So, here's what we're covering today. First, what
2:10:32
is Gemini 3 Pro and why should you care? Second, how to use it in the Gemini app
2:10:38
for beginners. Third, I'm going to show you Nano Banana Pro, which makes incredible images. Fourth, VO3.1, which
2:10:44
turns those images into actual videos. And fifth, the big one, build mode in Google AI Studio, where you can build
2:10:52
entire apps with zero code. This is the part that's going to blow your mind. Let me start with what Gemini 3 Pro actually
2:10:58
is. Google calls it their most intelligent model. It beats their old model Gemini 2.5 Pro on all the major
2:11:05
tests. It's designed to handle PhD level reasoning. That means it can solve really hard problems that other AI
2:11:12
models struggle with. And it has something called deep think mode coming soon, which makes it even smarter for
2:11:18
complex tasks. But here's what matters for you. Gemini 3 Pro understands everything. Text, images, code,
2:11:26
documents, audio, video, all of it. You can throw a huge code base at it or a long document and it just gets it. This
2:11:32
is what they call multimodal. It means one AI brain that handles all types of content instead of needing different
2:11:38
tools for different jobs. And here's the other big thing. It's built for agentic workflows. That's a fancy way of saying
2:11:44
it can plan things, call tools, write code, and fix code all on its own. You tell it what you want, and it figures
2:11:50
out the steps. This is huge for building apps and automating work. So, where do
2:11:55
you actually use this thing? There are three main places. First, the Gemini app on the web or your phone. This is the
2:12:01
easiest way for beginners. You just chat with it like chat GBT. Second, AI mode in Google search. If you're a
2:12:07
subscriber, you can route harder questions to Gemini 3 automatically. Third, Google AI Studio. This is where
2:12:14
the magic happens for building apps. And we're going to spend a lot of time here later. So, let me tell you about something that's going to save you so
2:12:21
much time. If you want to learn how to actually use AI tools like Gemini 3 Pro
2:12:26
to automate your business and save hours every single day, you need to check out AI Profit Boardroom. This is where we
2:12:33
teach you the exact workflows to use AI for content creation, SEO, video
2:12:38
production, and way more. We show you how to build systems that actually work so you're not wasting time figuring this
2:12:44
stuff out yourself. The link is in the description. Trust me, if you're serious about using AI the right way, this is
2:12:51
where you need to be. Okay, back to the good stuff now. Let's talk about pricing because I know you're wondering. For
2:12:56
regular people who just want to use Gemini, there are different plans. The AI Pro plan is about $20 a month. This
2:13:03
gets you access to Gemini 3 Pro with higher limits. Then there's the Ultra plan, which is around $125 a month.
2:13:10
That's the top tier with the most features. Free users can still use Gemini 3, but you get limited usage and
2:13:17
it switches to smaller models when you hit the limit. For developers and power users who want to use the API, it's
2:13:22
different. You pay per token, which is basically per word. Under 200,000 tokens, it costs about $2 per million
2:13:29
input tokens and $12 per million output tokens. If you go over 200,000 tokens,
2:13:35
the price goes up to $4 input and $18 output. I'll put a chart on screen so you can see the breakdown clearly. Okay,
2:13:41
now here comes the really cool part. Let me introduce you to Nano Banana Pro. Yes, that's actually what Google named
2:13:46
it. Nano Banana Pro is Gemini 3 Pro's image engine. It's a state-of-the-art
2:13:52
image generation model built on top of Gemini 3 Pro, and it's designed specifically for real work, not just
2:13:58
art. Here's what makes it different from tools like Midjourney or Deli. Nano Banana Pro uses reasoning and world
2:14:05
knowledge to make accurate images. So if you ask it to make an educational diagram or an infographic, it actually
2:14:12
understands the topic and creates something correct. It's not just making random pretty pictures. This is perfect
2:14:17
for making photo real images, infographics, diagrams, UI mockups, and visuals for presentations or ads. You
2:14:25
can use Nano Banana Pro in a few places. First, in the Gemini app, you just choose create images with the thinking
2:14:32
model, right? Second, it's built into Google Workspace now. So in Google Slides, Google Vids, Notebook LM, and
2:14:39
Google Ads, you can generate images with Nano Banana Pro. Third, in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI for developers,
2:14:47
here's something important about watermarks. If you're using the free or pro tier, your images will have a
2:14:53
visible Gemini Sparkle watermark, plus an invisible Synth ID signature. But if
2:14:58
you're an Ultra subscriber or using Google AI Studio Developer Tools, you can get images without the visible
2:15:05
watermark. They still have the invisible synth ID tag, but no sparkle. This is huge if you're making content for
2:15:11
clients or professional work. Now, let's talk about Veo 3.1. This is Google's video generation model. It makes
2:15:18
highquality 1080p videos with really good motion and creative control. VO3.1
2:15:24
can do text to video where you just describe what you want. But the real magic is image to video. You give it a
2:15:30
single image or two images for start and end frames and it animates them into smooth video. It handles cinematic
2:15:36
camera motion, realistic lighting, and it can even add audio if you want. This is perfect for storyboarding, product
2:15:43
videos, concept animations, and social media clips. Now, I'm going to show you the part that's going to change
2:15:49
everything. The build mode in Google AI Studio. This is insane. Build mode is the fastest way to go from an idea to a
2:15:56
working app. You just describe what you want in normal English and build mode does everything. It picks the right
2:16:02
models like Gemini 3 Pro or Nano Banana Pro. It generates the code, the project structure and the user interface and you
2:16:09
see a live preview on the right side of your screen as it builds. It even has something called AI chips. These let you
2:16:15
add features like image generation or Google Maps just by describing what you want. And if you're stuck and don't know
2:16:21
what to build, there's a button that says, "I'm feeling lucky." You click it and it gives you a complete app idea and builds it for you. This is wild. Let me
2:16:28
break down how the code works so you understand what's happening. When you build something in build mode, it creates a file called Gemini service.ts.
2:16:36
This is the main logic file. It handles all your prompts, calls the Gemini API, passes the responses, and routes
2:16:43
everything to the right models. It uses the Genai TypeScript SDK to talk to Gemini 3 Pro and the other models. You
2:16:50
don't need to understand coding to use this, but it's good to know what's going on under the hood. The cool part is how you can change things. You use the chat
2:16:57
panel in build mode to ask for updates. You can say add a button that generates three new thumbnail ideas or change the
2:17:03
color scheme to dark mode with neon accents or integrate Nano Banana Pro to generate images from the script. Gemini
2:17:10
3 Pro understands what you want and updates the code live. You can also open the code tab and manually edit things if
2:17:16
you want more control. Then you can save everything to GitHub. Now, let me show you a real workflow that connects
2:17:21
everything together. I'm going to walk through how to use Gemini 3 Pro, Nano Banana Pro, and Veo 3.1 to build a
2:17:29
complete YouTube content pipeline. This is the kind of workflow that would normally take hours with multiple tools,
2:17:35
but we're going to do it all in one place. Step one, use Gemini 3 Pro to plan and script your video. Go to the
2:17:41
Gemini app or AI mode. Give it a prompt like this. You are a YouTube strategist. Plan a 10-minute video called whatever
2:17:48
your topic is. Include a hook, chapters, b-roll ideas, and CTAs for beginners.
2:17:54
Then refine it by saying, "Write a conversational script in my voice." And describe your style. Fast-paced, no
2:17:59
fluff, whatever fits you. Gemini 3 Pro is really strong at complex planning and long context, so it can handle long
2:18:06
scripts and multiple revisions way better than older models. Step two, generate your visual assets with Nano
2:18:13
Banana Pro. Go to the Gemini app and choose create images or use Google Slides or AI Studio. Start with
2:18:20
thumbnails. Say create a clean YouTube thumbnail concept for a video titled whatever your title is. Modern dark UI
2:18:27
Gemini colors, big text, no faces. Then make infographics. Say design a simple
2:18:32
infographic explaining the difference between Gemini 3 Pro, Nano Banana Pro, and Veo 3.1 for beginners. Then create
2:18:40
storyboard frames. Generate a sequence of images showing each chapter of your video. If you're using the developer
2:18:46
environment in AI Studio, you can use the Gemini image API to generate these assets programmatically, which is even
2:18:52
faster. Step three, turn your images into motion with Veo 3.1. Use a Veo 3.1
2:18:58
powered tool. Upload one of your Nano Banana Pro images. Give it a prompt to like animate this as a slow zoom in with
2:19:05
a floating UI HUD and subtle parallax. 8 seconds, 16x9 YouTube intro background.
2:19:12
For transitions between scenes, give it two frames, one for the start and one for the end. And let Vo 3.1 create a
2:19:19
smooth motion between them. Choose video plus audio if you want background sound or just video only if you don't need it.
2:19:26
This is how you go from static images to cinematic motion. Now, here's where it gets really powerful. Step four, build a
2:19:32
content machine app in build mode. This is the hero move. Go to Google AI Studio and click build mode. Start with a
2:19:38
prompt like this. Build a simple web app called Gemini Content Machine that helps YouTube creators generate a video
2:19:45
outline and script using Gemini 3 Pro. Generate thumbnail prompts and images
2:19:51
using Nano Banana Pro. and then export a shot list to feed into a VO3.1 workflow.
2:19:56
The UI should have three tabs called plan, visuals, and export. Use a clean, dark theme. Watch what happens. Build
2:20:03
mode starts creating your app in real time. You can add AI chips in the prompt or through the interface. Tell it to use
2:20:09
Gemini 3 Pro for text and reasoning, Nano Banana Pro for image generation, and optionally add live search for
2:20:16
research. Click build or run, and you'll see the app preview appear on the right side of your screen. Open Gemini
2:20:22
service.ts and you can actually see how it's calling Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro through the STA. Now you can
2:20:29
iterate using the chat. Say make the plan tab allow the user to choose video
2:20:34
length like short 5 minutes or 10 minutes and adjust the script detail accordingly. Or add a button in the
2:20:41
visuals tab that generates three thumbnail ideas plus 3B roll image prompts. Or add a drop down to export a
2:20:47
CSV shot list. Gemini 3 Pro updates the code every time you ask. This is what they call vibe coding. You vibe out what
2:20:54
you want and the AI builds it. When you're done, you can deploy or export the code to GitHub and then integrate it
2:21:00
with whatever VO3.1 interface you're using. This is a complete content creation pipeline built in under 30
2:21:07
minutes with zero coding knowledge required. That's the power of build mode. Let me give you some advanced tips real quick. Gemini 3 Pro in AI Studio
2:21:14
can do what's called agentic coding. This means it can plan multifile changes, write code, refactor code, and
2:21:21
respond to your feedback across multiple sessions. You can build landing pages, interactive dashboards, even simple
2:21:28
games. The key is to describe what you want clearly and let it figure out the steps. You can also ask it to add
2:21:34
features like a generate with VO 3.1 button that creates a structured prompt from your shot list. Even if you can't
2:21:40
call Veo's API directly, you can generate the text prompt and paste it into a VO interface. Here's some best
2:21:47
practices you need to know. First, safety and compliance. Google has built-in safety filters and all Nano
2:21:53
Banana Pro images get watermarked with synth ID. Always use AI responsibly.
2:21:58
Avoid harmful content and disallowed topics. And always disclose to your audience when content is AI generated.
2:22:05
That's just being honest. Second, performance tips. Use Gemini 3 Pro for heavy reasoning, planning, and long
2:22:11
context tasks. Use faster models for quick questions or drafts. When generating images, do batches instead of
2:22:17
single prompts. It's way more efficient. For Veo 3.1 test short clips first, like
2:22:22
3 to 5 seconds before you pay for longer sequences. Third, versioning and scaling. Save your build mode projects
2:22:29
to GitHub for version control. When you outgrow the playground and need production level apps move to Vertex AI
2:22:35
or direct API integration, this gives you more control and better performance for real business use. Let me give you
2:22:41
the comparison with old workflows. The old way was using chat GBT for planning, then midjourney for images, then runway
2:22:48
or PA for video. That's three different subscriptions, three different interfaces, three different sets of prompts, and you're copying and pasting
2:22:55
between them constantly. The new way is Gemini 3 Pro for planning, Nano Banana Pro for images, Veo 3.1 for video, all
2:23:02
wired together in build mode. One workflow, one ecosystem, way less friction. Here's what you should do
2:23:08
next. First, go try building one small app in build mode today. Start with something simple like a script generator
2:23:14
or a thumbnail idea tool where just get your hands dirty and see how it works. Second, experiment with Nano Banana Pro
2:23:22
to create some visual assets. Make a few thumbnails, some diagrams, some storyboard frames. See what the quality
2:23:29
is like. Third, if you have access to VO3.1, test it with image to video. Take
2:23:34
one of your Nano Banana Pro images and animate it. See how the motion looks. The key is to actually use these tools,
2:23:40
not just watch videos about them. That's how you learn what works and what doesn't. And comment below and tell me
2:23:45
what you want to see automated next. Do you want a tutorial on building a specific type of app? Do you want to see
2:23:52
more Veo 3.1 workflows? Let me know because I read every comment and I make videos based on what you actually want
2:23:58
to learn. If you want to go deeper, join AI Profit Boardroom. We teach you the exact systems to use AI for SEO, content
2:24:05
creation, automation, and growing your business. We don't just show you tools, we show you how to build profitable
2:24:11
systems with them. The link is in the description. This is where the real learning happens. Google Gemini just
2:24:18
dropped five brand new updates that are completely free. And these updates are going to change everything about how you
2:24:24
work with AI. I'm talking about memory that actually remembers you. A design tool that redesigns entire websites in
2:24:31
seconds and an AI mode in Google search that's way better than chat GPT. Plus, there's a coding studio that builds apps
2:24:38
for you and something called dynamic view that creates interactive websites on the spot. This is huge. Let's get
2:24:44
into it. All right. So, update number one is Gemini's enhanced memory. And this is a gamecher because now Gemini
2:24:52
actually remembers who you are, what you do, and how you like things done. So, here's how it works. You go into Gemini
2:24:58
and you tell it stuff about yourself like, "I'm a business owner. I like short answers. I work in SEO." Whatever
2:25:03
it is. And Gemini saves all of that. Then, every time you talk to it, it remembers. But here's where it gets crazy. Google owns YouTube. They own
2:25:10
Gmail. They own Google Drive. They own Google Docs. They own Google Search. So if you turn on the right settings, all
2:25:16
of that data works together. Gemini knows your emails, your documents, your search history, everything. So let's say
2:25:21
you tell Gemini, remember I run a marketing agency. Remember I focus on SEO and AI tools. Remember my clients
2:25:27
are in the tech space. Now every time you ask Gemini something, it gives you answers based on that. It's like having
2:25:33
an assistant who actually knows you. And you can update it anytime. Just say remember this and it saves it. Then it
2:25:39
uses that info forever. No more repeating yourself. No more generic answers. Everything is personalized to
2:25:44
you. Now, you can also train it on your past chats. So, all those conversations you've had with Gemini before, it can
2:25:50
learn from those, too. This means the more you use it, the smarter it gets about what you need. And here's the best part. You can manage all of this in one
2:25:56
place. There's a memory module where you can see everything Gemini knows about you. You can add stuff, delete stuff,
2:26:02
change stuff. You're in control. And this is huge for productivity because now you don't have to explain yourself every single time. Gemini just knows.
2:26:09
And that saves you time. Google has this tool called Stitch and they just added a redesign feature and this thing is wild.
2:26:16
So here's what it does. You take a screenshot of any website. You upload it to Stitch. Then you tell it how you want
2:26:21
it redesigned and it redesigns the entire website for you in seconds. I'm talking about complete redesigns. New
2:26:27
layouts, new colors, new sections, everything. And it looks professional, like really professional. So let's say
2:26:32
you have a website that converts at 2%. You want to bump that up to 5%. You screenshot your homepage, upload it to
2:26:38
Stitch, and say, "Make this convert better for people looking to get more Instagram followers." And boom, it gives
2:26:44
you a completely new design. And you can do this over and over. You can generate multiple versions. You can annotate the
2:26:50
design and tell it to change specific parts. You can give it a thumbs up or thumbs down. And when you're happy with
2:26:55
it, you can export it directly to Google AI Studio and have it coded up for you. This is insane for anyone running a
2:27:01
business because now you don't need to hire a designer. You don't need to spend weeks testing layouts. You just upload,
2:27:07
describe what you want, and Stitch does the rest. And here's the crazy part. You can use this for apps, too, not just
2:27:13
websites. So, if you have an app idea, you can sketch it out, upload it to Stitch, and get a professional design in
2:27:19
minutes. Now, if you want to learn how to use tools like Google Gemini to automate your entire business and save
2:27:25
hundreds of hours every month, you need to check out my AI Profit Boardroom. This is where I teach business owners
2:27:30
how to use AI to scale faster, get more customers, and cut costs. We've got live
2:27:35
trainings, automation templates, and a community of people who are already doing this. The link is in the
2:27:41
description. Go check it out. All right. Update number three. Google completely changed how search works. And this is
2:27:46
big because they're coming after chat GPT hard. So now when you search on Google, there's something called AI
2:27:52
mode. And it's not like the old AI overview that just gave you a paragraph. This thing is interactive. You can have
2:27:57
full conversations with it. You can ask it to create tables, compare things, break down complex topics, and it does
2:28:02
it all in real time. So, let's say you search, compare memory foam versus hybrid mattresses. In the old search,
2:28:08
you get a bunch of links, maybe an AI overview, but now in AI mode, it creates a full table for you. Sideby-side
2:28:14
comparison, pros, cons, prices, everything. And you can keep asking questions like, which one is better for
2:28:20
back pain? And it updates the table. Which one lasts longer? It adds more info. You're not clicking links anymore.
2:28:25
You're just talking to Gemini and getting exactly what you need. And here's where it gets even better. AI mode searches hundreds of sites in
2:28:32
seconds. Then it pulls the best info and gives it to you in one place. So, you're not wasting time reading 10 different
2:28:37
articles. You're getting the answer right away. Plus, there's an AI history tab, so you can see all your past
2:28:42
searches and conversations. And you can go back and continue them. This is huge if you're researching something over
2:28:47
multiple days. And you can upload images, you can create images, you can even talk to it with your voice. So if
2:28:53
you're driving or you're busy, you can just ask your questions out loud. This is Google saying, "We're not losing to
2:28:58
chat GPT. We're going to dominate AI search." And honestly, they might be right because this is really good.
2:29:03
Update number four is Google AI Studio. And this is where things get wild because now you can build apps that have
2:29:10
Gemini built into them. And you don't need to be a coder. So let's say you want to build an app that analyzes
2:29:15
YouTube videos. You go into AI Studio, you tell it what you want, and it builds it for you. I'm not kidding. You just
2:29:20
describe it and it codes the whole thing. I tested this myself. I built a YouTube video optimizer. You paste in a
2:29:26
video URL, the title, the description, the script, and the app gives you AI feedback on how to make it better. It
2:29:32
tells you what to change, what to add, what to remove, all automatically. And I built another one that generates YouTube
2:29:38
thumbnails. You describe what you want and it creates the thumbnail for you. Professional looking, ready to upload.
2:29:45
And here's the crazy part. You can export designs from Stitch directly into AI Studio. So, you design something in
2:29:50
Stitch, click export, and AI Studio codes it for you in seconds. Then you have a fully working app or website. All
2:29:56
right, final update. This one is my favorite. It's called dynamic view, and it's going to change education forever.
2:30:02
So, here's how it works. You ask Gemini a question like explain how quantum mechanics works. And instead of giving
2:30:08
you a text answer, it builds an entire interactive website for you on the spot. I'm talking about simulations, diagrams,
2:30:15
examples, everything. is like having a custom learning experience built just for you and it happens in seconds. So I
2:30:20
asked it about quantum mechanics and it built me this thing called quantum explorer. It's a full website with
2:30:25
interactive simulations. I can click buttons, run experiments, see how particles behave. It's like a science
2:30:31
lab on my screen. And this works for anything. You can ask about biology, physics, history, coding, whatever. And
2:30:36
it builds you a custom learning tool with visuals, with interactions, with everything you need to actually
2:30:41
understand it. This is insane for students because now you're not just reading boring text. You're actually interacting with the concepts. You're
2:30:48
seeing them in action. You're learning by doing. And remember, this works with the memory feature. So, if you tell
2:30:53
Gemini, I learn best with visuals or I like step-by-step explanations. It builds the experience based on that.
2:30:59
It's personalized to you. I wish this existed when I was in school because this would have saved me so much time
2:31:04
and I would have actually understood things instead of just memorizing them. And you can ask Gemini questions inside
2:31:09
the dynamic view. So, if something doesn't make sense, you just ask and it updates the website in real time. It
2:31:15
adds more examples, more simulations, more explanations until you get it. This is the future of learning and it's free
2:31:21
right now on Google Gemini. All right, so those are the five updates. Enhanced memory, stitch redesign, AI mode in
2:31:28
search, AI studio for building apps, and dynamic view for interactive learning. And all of this is free. You don't have
2:31:34
to pay for Gemini Pro. You don't have to upgrade. It's all available right now. So, if you're not using Gemini yet, now
2:31:39
is the time because Google is going allin on AI and they're making it so easy to use that anyone can take
2:31:45
advantage of it. Now, if you want to take this even further and learn how to automate your entire business with AI tools like Google Gemini, you need to
2:31:52
join my AI profit boardroom. This is where I show you exactly how to use AI to scale your business, get more
2:31:58
customers, and save hundreds of hours every month. We've got step-by-step trainings, automation templates, live
2:32:04
workshops, and a community of entrepreneurs who are already doing this. The link is in the description. Go
2:32:10
check it out. You can now tap on images and they explain themselves. Generate videos from photos in seconds. Build
2:32:16
interactive diagrams that teach you. The AI can even run tasks for you automatically. This isn't just an
Nano Banana Pro Image Generation
2:32:22
update. This is a total gamecher. If you're a student, creator, or business owner, you need to see this. Today, I'm
2:32:29
breaking down everything new. the stuff that actually matters and how you can use it right now. Let's get into it. So,
2:32:35
Gemini just got a massive update, and when I say massive, I mean it. This is Gemini 3. Google is calling it their
2:32:41
most intelligent model yet. And they're not lying. The way this thing understands context is wild. You can
2:32:46
throw complex questions at it. It gets it. The responses are smarter, better formatted, and more helpful. But here's
2:32:52
where it gets really interesting. The app itself got redesigned. There's now a my stuff folder where you can organize
2:32:58
all your images, videos, and created content in one place. No more searching through old chats trying to find that
2:33:05
image you made last week. Everything is organized. Everything is easy to access. But wait, there's more. Gemini now has
2:33:11
something called generative interfaces. What does that mean? It means the app adapts to your prompt. If you ask for a
2:33:18
visual layout, it gives you a visual layout. If you need an interactive diagram, it builds that. The AI
2:33:23
understands what format makes the most sense and delivers it automatically. No extra work from you. Now, here's the
2:33:29
part that blew my mind. Interactive images. Let me explain. You know those complex diagrams in textbooks, biology
2:33:36
diagrams, anatomy charts, chemistry structures, they used to just sit there static. You had to figure them out
2:33:42
yourself. Not anymore. Now you can tap on any part of the image and Gemini explains it. You tap on a part of a
2:33:47
cell, it tells you what it does. You tap on a muscle in an anatomy chart, it breaks down its function. This is huge
2:33:53
for students, huge for educators, huge for anyone learning something new. You're not just reading anymore. You're
2:33:59
exploring. You're interacting. The app went from passive to active. And that changes everything. All right, let me
2:34:05
talk about image generation. The old tool was called Nano Banana. It was decent, but now we have Nano Banana Pro,
2:34:11
also called Gemini 3 Pro Image. The quality is way better. The context awareness is better. It can handle
2:34:17
multilingual text and images. The formatting is cleaner. The layouts are more professional. If you're making
2:34:23
graphics for social media, presentations, or marketing, this is a game changer. You can create
2:34:28
professionallook visuals in seconds. No design skills needed. No expensive software. Just you and the AI. But it
2:34:35
gets even crazier. Video generation. Gemini now has a tool called VO 3.1. You
2:34:40
can turn images into videos. You can control the style, the scene, the characters, the objects, everything.
2:34:46
Content creators, listen up. You can upload a photo and turn it into a full
2:34:51
video with motion, with transitions, with creative control. If you're making explainer videos, tutorials, or social
2:34:57
media content, you need to try this. It's fast, it's easy, and the results are insane. Now, here's something for
2:35:03
the power users. Gemini Agent. This is rolling out to ultra subscribers first.
2:35:08
What does it do? It performs tasks for you. multi-step tasks like organizing
2:35:13
your inbox, booking appointments, planning trips, managing your schedule. It's not just answering questions
2:35:19
anymore. It's doing the work. This is where AI goes from assistant to agent. And it's only going to get better. All
2:35:24
right. So, if you're loving this content and you want to learn how to automate your entire business with tools like
2:35:30
Gemini, you need to check out the AI Profit Boardroom. This is where I show you exactly how to save hundreds of
2:35:36
hours and scale your business using AI automation. Inside you'll get access to AI workflows, case studies, and a
2:35:44
community of entrepreneurs who are already using AI to transform their businesses. Whether you're using Gemini
2:35:50
for content creation, productivity, or customer service, the AI profit boardroom will show you how to take it
2:35:55
to the next level. Click the link in the description and join us today. Let me give you some real examples. Say you're
2:36:01
a student studying biology. You've got a complex diagram of the human heart. Before you'd stare at it, try to
2:36:07
memorize the parts. Maybe Google each term individually. Now you upload it to Gemini. Tap on the aorta. Gemini
2:36:15
explains what it does. Tap on the ventricle. It breaks down its function. You're learning faster. You're understanding deeper. This is the future
2:36:22
of education. Example two. You're a content creator. You need to make an infographic for Instagram. Before you'd
2:36:28
open Canva, mess around with templates, spend an hour getting it right. Now you tell Gemini what you want. It generates
2:36:34
the layout, adds the text, formats everything. You're done in 5 minutes. Example three. You're making a tutorial
2:36:40
video. You need visuals to explain a concept. Before you'd film everything, edit in Premiere Pro. Add motion
2:36:47
graphics. Hours of work. Now, you give Gemini a photo or reference frame. It generates the video with the style you
2:36:53
want, the motion you need, the explanation built in. You just saved yourself days of work. Example four.
2:36:59
You're a developer or power user. You want to build an app that autogenerates educational content. Before you need
2:37:06
multiple tools, multiple APIs, a lot of coding. Now Gemini has an API. You can tap into the image generation, the video
2:37:13
generation, the interactive visuals all in one place. You build faster, you launch faster, you scale faster. Now,
2:37:19
let me show you the before and after because this is important. Old Gemini could do basic stuff. Text generation,
2:37:25
image understanding, simple image creation. It was good, but it had limits. The image generation wasn't
2:37:33
great. Video creation was almost non-existent for most users. Diagrams were static. You couldn't interact with
2:37:38
anything. And there was no agent feature. You had to do everything manually. New Gemini, everything levels
2:37:43
up. The multimodal understanding is way deeper. It gets context better. It combines text, images, and data
2:37:50
seamlessly. The image generation went from decent to professional. Video generation is now builtin. Diagrams are
2:37:57
interactive. You can tap and explore and the agent feature automates tasks. This isn't a small update. This is a total
2:38:03
transformation. Gemini went from a smart assistant to a full creative and productivity platform. And that's huge.
2:38:09
Let me talk about what this means for you. If you're a student, your learning just got 10 times easier. You can
2:38:15
interact with your study materials, get instant explanations, create study aids in seconds. If you're a teacher or
2:38:21
educator, you can make better content faster. interactive diagrams for your students. Custom visuals for your
2:38:28
lessons, videos that explain complex topics. If you're a content creator, you just got a massive upgrade. You can
2:38:34
generate graphics, videos, and layouts without expensive tools. You can create professional content in minutes instead
2:38:40
of hours. If you're running a business, you can automate tasks, save time on emails, planning, and organization. Use
2:38:47
AI to do the heavy lifting. And if you're a developer, you can build tools and apps faster. You have access to
2:38:53
powerful APIs. You can create educational platforms, creative tools, and more. This democratizes creation.
2:39:00
You don't need advanced skills. You don't need expensive software. You just need Gemini. Now, let's be real. It's not perfect. Some features are limited
2:39:06
to pro or ultra users. If you're on the free plan, you might not get everything. The agent feature is only available to
2:39:12
certain subscribers right now. If you haven't tried Gemini 3 yet, you need to upload a diagram from your textbook. See
2:39:19
what happens. Ask it to make an infographic. See what it creates. Try the video generation. See how fast it
2:39:26
is. This is the future and it's here now. If you want to go even deeper with AI automation and learn how to use tools
2:39:32
like Gemini to transform your business, join the AI profit boardroom. You'll get advanced workflows, expert guidance, and
2:39:38
a community of people who are already seeing results with AI. The link is in the description. New Google Gemini 3.0
2:39:46
is here. Google just dropped Gemini 3. This thing is nuts. It can build entire apps from a single sentence. It thinks
2:39:53
deeper than any AI you've used. And it's changing how we work with AI forever. Today, I'm showing you everything. Now,
2:39:59
Google just released Gemini 3, and this is the biggest AI update we've seen in months. I'm talking about an AI that can
2:40:05
actually think through problems like a human. An AI that builds apps while you watch. An AI that creates interactive
2:40:12
websites on the fly. This isn't just another chatbot upgrade. This is a complete gamecher for anyone who uses AI
2:40:19
for work. And by the end of this video, you're going to know exactly how to use it. So, let's dive in. First, what makes
2:40:25
Gemini 3 so special? Google calls this their most intelligent AI model ever.
2:40:31
And they're not just hyping it up. This thing has three major upgrades that blow everything else out of the water. Number
2:40:37
one, it thinks deeper. Number two, it understands everything you throw at it. Number three, it creates interactive
2:40:44
content in real time. Let me break each one down for you. The first upgrade is called deep think mode.
2:40:50
This is huge. Most AR models give you quick answers. They're fast, but they're surface level. Gemini 3 with deep think
2:40:56
actually stops and thinks. It breaks down your question into smaller parts. It analyzes each part separately. Then
2:41:02
it puts everything together into a complete answer. This means you get way better responses without typing long
2:41:09
prompts. You can throw a research paper at it, ask it to analyze a complex sports strategy or have it solve a
2:41:15
business problem with multiple moving parts and it handles it all. The second upgrade is multimodal understanding. And
2:41:21
Gemini 3 doesn't just read text, it sees images, it watches videos, it connects all of it together. You can upload a
2:41:28
screenshot and ask it to explain what's happening. You can show it a diagram and ask it to recreate it. You can even give
2:41:33
it a video and ask it to summarize the key points. This opens up so many use cases. For content creators, you can
2:41:40
analyze competitor videos. For developers, you can show it a design and ask it to code it. For researchers, you
2:41:47
can feed it visual data and get instant insights. Before I move further, let me tell you about two things that are going
2:41:53
to change your business. First is my AI profit boardroom. This is the best place to scale your business, get more
2:41:59

2:42:26
All right, let's keep going. The third upgrade is the wildest one. It's called Generative Interfaces. This is where
2:42:33
Gemini 3 gets really crazy. You give it a prompt and it doesn't just give you text back. It builds an entire
2:42:39
interactive interface. I'm talking clickable buttons, tabs that switch between different views, widgets that
2:42:45
update in real time, dynamic layouts that adjust based on what you need. All generated on the fly from your prompt.
2:42:52
Let me give you an example. You could say, "Show me a comparison of three marketing strategies." And Gemini 3
2:42:58
doesn't just list them out. It creates a full interactive dashboard with tabs for each strategy, charts that visualize the
2:43:05
data, buttons to dive deeper into each one. This is insane for productivity. You're not just getting information
2:43:11
anymore. You're getting working tools built for you instantly. Now, let me talk about Vibe Coding. This is Gemini
2:43:18
3's coding superpower. Vibe coding means you describe what you want in plain English, and Gemini 3 builds the entire
2:43:25
app for you. No technical knowledge needed. No complicated coding skills required. You just tell it what you want
2:43:31
and it handles the rest. Want a progress tracker for your team? Describe it and watch it build. Want a custom calculator
2:43:37
for your business? Tell it what calculations you need and it creates it. I want a visual tool to organize your
2:43:43
projects. Explain your workflow and it makes it happen. This is autonomy we've never seen before. The AI isn't just
2:43:49
helping you code. It's doing the coding for you start to finish. For entrepreneurs, this is massive. You can
2:43:56
build tools for your business without hiring developers. You can test ideas fast without spending months on
2:44:01
development. You can create custom solutions that fit your exact needs. And here's where it gets even better. Gemini
2:44:08
3 is integrated across all of Google's products. That means you're using it even if you don't realize it. It's in
2:44:14
Google search with something called AI mode. When you search now, you don't just get links. You get immersive visual
2:44:20
layouts, interactive elements built into your search results, dynamic content that adapts to what you're looking for.
2:44:26
It's like having a personal research assistant built into search. Gemini 3 is also in Google AI Studio. This is where
2:44:32
developers and power users can really push the limits. You get access to the full API where you can build your own
2:44:39
applications on top of Gemini 3. You can integrate it into your existing workflows and you can customize it for
2:44:45
your specific use cases. But wait, there's more. And this part is wild. Gemini 3 now has video generation built
2:44:52
in. It's powered by something called Veo 3.1 API. This isn't just any video
2:44:57
generator. This thing creates highquality video with native audio. You can give it a text prompt and it
2:45:03
generates the video. You can upload a reference image and it keeps the subject consistent across frames. You can even
2:45:09
extend existing videos or generate specific frames. Let me give you some examples of what this means. Say you're
2:45:16
a content creator. You need B-roll footage for your video. Instead of searching stock libraries for hours, you
2:45:22
describe what you need. Gemini 3 generates it for you. Custom footage that matches your exact vision. Or say
2:45:29
you're a marketer, you need product demo videos, upload a photo of your product, describe how you want it showcased, and
2:45:36
Gemini 3 creates the entire video for you. Or say you're an educator, you need animated explanations for complex
2:45:43
topics. You describe the concept. Gemini 3 turns it into a visual video that
2:45:48
makes it easy to understand. This is the future of video content. No expensive production teams, no hours of editing.
2:45:55
Just describe what you want and get it. Now, let me show you how to actually use Gemini 3 today because all of this
2:46:01
sounds amazing, but you need to know where to access it. The easiest way is through Google AI Studio. This is
2:46:06
Google's platform for trying out their latest AI models. You can access Gemini 3 right now. You can test deep think
2:46:13
mode. You can try vibe coding. You can experiment with video generation. It's all available to use. Another way is
2:46:19
through AI mode in Google search. Just search like you normally would, but now you'll see these rich interactive
2:46:25
results powered by Gemini 3. It's seamless and it built right into your
2:46:30
search experience. And if you're a developer, you can use the Gemini API. This lets you integrate Gemini 3 into
2:46:36
your own apps and tools. You get full access to all the capabilities I just talked about and you can build custom
2:46:43
solutions for your business or your clients. So what should you actually use Gemini 3 for? Let me give you some
2:46:49
practical examples. If you're doing research, use deep think mode. Feed it complex papers or data. Ask it to find
2:46:57
connections you might have missed. Get summaries that actually understand the nuance. If you're building tools, use
2:47:03
Vibe coding. Describe the app you need. Let Gemini 3 build it for you. Iterate
2:47:08
fast without technical bottlenecks. If you're creating content, use the video generation. Make custom footage for your
2:47:14
videos. Create animated explainers. Generate visual assets that fit your brand. If you're analyzing data, use the
2:47:21
multimodal capabilities. Upload charts, screen for it, screenshots or diagrams.
2:47:26
Ask Gemini 3 to explain trends or patterns. Get insights you wouldn't
2:47:32
catch on your own. The key here is that Gemini 3 adapts to how you work. It's not a one-sizefits-all tool. It's
2:47:39
flexible enough to handle whatever you throw at it. Now, let me talk about something important. This is a tool, not
2:47:44
magic. You still need to guide it. You still need to ask the right questions, and you still need to verify what it
2:47:49
gives you, but when you use it right, it's incredibly powerful. It saves you hours of work. It opens up capabilities
2:47:55
you didn't have before, and it levels the playing field for anyone who wants to build with AI. Julian Goldie reads

the description to learn more. This is where the real transformation happens. So, here's my final takeaway for you.
2:48:50
Gemini 3 is not just an upgrade. It's a shift in what's possible with AI. The combination of deep think mode,
2:48:57
multimodal understanding, generative interfaces, vibe coding, and video generation is unprecedented. This is the
2:49:04
kind of tool that changes how you work. It automates tasks that used to take hours. It creates outputs that used to
2:49:10
require entire teams, and it does it all faster and better than anything we've had before. If you're not experimented
2:49:16
with Gemini 3 yet, now's the time. Get into Google AI Studio, start testing what it can do. Push it to the limits
2:49:22
and see what you can build. Because the people who master this early are going to have a massive advantage. They're
2:49:28
going to build faster. They're going to create better content and they're going to solve problems their competitors
2:49:34
can't. So, don't sleep on this. Gemini 3 is here and it's changing the game. Now, let me tell you about something that's
2:49:39
going to take everything you just learned to the next level. New Gemini 3.0 update is insane. So, Google just
Workspace Flows & AI Agent Automation
2:49:48
released Gemini 3 Pro. Not a rumor, not a leak. It's rolling out globally today.
2:49:53
This is the first model in the Gemini 3 family. And Google is bringing this to more products than they ever have
2:49:58
before. They're calling this their most anticipated launch of the year. And after seeing what it can do, I get why
2:50:04
Gemini 3 is Google's most intelligent model yet. That's what they're saying. And they're backing it up with some wild
2:50:11
features. First, generative interfaces. This means responses that are perfectly designed for what you need, not just
2:50:17
text, not just an answer. Full designed outputs that match your request. Second, Gemini agent. This is AI that completes
2:50:25
complex tasks for you, not answers questions, does the actual work, plans it, executes it, finishes it, and third,
2:50:32
it can help you learn, build, and plan anything. Those are Google's words, anything. Let me break down what that
2:50:38
means. Google says today they're taking a big step on the path toward AGI. That's artificial general intelligence
2:50:44
AI that can do anything a human can do. They're not saying they built AGI. They're saying this is a big step toward
2:50:50
it. And Gemini 3 is the model that gets them closer. Google says with Gemini 3,
2:50:55
you can bring any idea to life, any idea. That's a big claim. But they're backing it up with three things. First,
2:51:02
it's state-of-the-art in reasoning. That means it thinks better than any other AI. It can work through complex
2:51:08
problems, plan multiple steps, connect ideas, make decisions. This is the thinking part. Second, it's the best
2:51:14
model in the world for multimodal understanding. Best in the world. That's not me saying it. That's Google.
2:51:19
Multimodal means images, text, video, audio. It understands all of it better
2:51:25
than anything else. And third, it's their best agentic and vibe coding model. Agentic means it acts like an
2:51:31
agent. It does things. Vibe coding means it writes code that feels right. Code that matches your style. code that just
2:51:36
works. Let's talk about the image stuff because this is where it gets insane. With Gemini 3, you can take an image of
2:51:42
anything. A board game, a floor plan, a doodle, anything. And Gemini 3 can make it an interactive experience. Not
2:51:49
describe it, not tell you about it, make it interactive, make it work. This is because of Gemini 3's deep multimodal
2:51:56
understanding. Here's how it works. The model looks at your image. It analyzes the content. It figures out what the
2:52:01
image is trying to be. Then it distills the most compelling parts. It finds what matters, what's important, what makes
2:52:07
sense. Then it translates the images details into a functional interactive experience. Functional means it works.
2:52:13
Interactive means you can use it. And if you want to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of
2:52:18
hours with AI automation, you need to check out my AI profit boardroom. Not just play around with it, actually build
2:52:24
systems that grow your business. Inside, you'll learn how to automate your marketing, generate leads on autopilot,
2:52:30
and use AI to do the work that used to take your entire team. I'll drop the link below. So, let me give you
2:52:35
examples. You draw a board game on paper, just a sketch. You take a photo of it. You upload it to Gemini 3. The AI
2:52:43
looks at your drawing. It sees the board, the spaces, the rules you wrote down. It figures out how the game works.
2:52:48
Then, it builds you a playable version. You can click on it, move pieces, play the game. You didn't code anything. You
2:52:54
didn't design anything. You just drew it. Gemini 3 did the rest. Or maybe you just doodle something, an idea, a
2:53:01
concept, a design. You're not even sure what it is yet. You upload it. Gemini 3 looks at it. It
2:53:09
figures out what you're trying to make. It sees the patterns, the structure, the intent. Then it turns
2:53:18
it into something you can interact with. Maybe a prototype, maybe a mockup, maybe a working demo. This is what deep
2:53:25
multimodal understanding means. The AI doesn't just see pixels. It understands what the image is supposed to be, what
2:53:31
it could become. Now, let's talk about reasoning because this is what makes Gemini 3 different from everything else.
2:53:38
State-of-the-art reasoning means it thinks deeper. Most AI gives you quick answers. Gemini 3 thinks through
2:53:43
problems. It plans, it considers options, it works through steps. Let's say you ask it to plan a project. A
2:53:50
normal AI might give you a list. Gemini 3 builds you a real plan. It thinks about dependencies, what needs to happen
2:53:57
first, what can happen at the same time, what might go wrong. It reasons through it like a human would, but faster and
2:54:04
more thorough. This reasoning also shows up in coding. Google calls this vibe coding. And I love that term. Vibe
2:54:10
coding means the AI writes code that feels right. It's not just correct. It's clean. It's organized. It matches your
2:54:18
style. If you like short variable names, it uses short names. If you like comments, it adds comments. If you like
2:54:23
a certain structure, it follows that structure. It vibes with you. And because of the reasoning, the code
2:54:28
actually works. It's not just syntactically correct. It solves the problem. It handles edge cases. It's production ready. And then there's the
2:54:35
agent part. Gemini agent. This is AI that completes complex tasks on your behalf. Not simple tasks. Complex tasks.
2:54:43
Tasks that have multiple steps. Tasks that need tools. Tasks that take time. You tell Gemini agent what you want
2:54:50
done. It breaks it down. It makes a plan. It uses the tools it needs. It executes each step. It checks the
2:54:56
results. It fixes problems. It keeps going until the task is done. You don't manage it. You don't supervise it. You
2:55:03
just tell it what you want. It handles the rest. Let me give you a real example. Let's say you want to build a website. You tell Gemini agent to build
2:55:10
you a landing page for your business. Our normal AI might give you some HTML code. Gemini Agent actually builds it.
2:55:17
It asks you what your business does. It researches similar websites. It designs a layout. It writes the copy. It codes
2:55:23
the page. It tests it in a browser. It checks for bugs. It fixes them. Then it shows you the finished page. All of that
2:55:30
from one request. That's what an agent does. Now, let's talk about the generative interfaces. This is one of
2:55:36
those features that sounds boring, but is actually gamechanging. Generative interfaces means the AI doesn't just
2:55:42
give you text. It generates the perfect interface for your answer. If you ask for data, it might build you a chart. If
2:55:49
you ask for a plan, it might create a timeline if you ask how something works. It might generate a diagram. The
2:55:54
interface matches what you need. It's designed for your specific request. This makes information way easier to
2:56:00
understand, way easier to use. And because Gemini 3 is rolling out to more products than ever, you're going to see
2:56:05
this everywhere. Google search, Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, all the Google apps. Gemini 3 is going to be
2:56:12
built in. That means this intelligence, this reasoning, this multimodal understanding is going to be available
2:56:18
wherever you work. You won't need to switch apps. You won't need to copy and paste. The AI is just there helping you,
2:56:24
building for you, thinking with you. So, what does this mean for you? Let's get practical. If you're learning something,
2:56:29
Gemini 3 can be your tutor. It can explain hard concepts, walk you through problems, create study guides, build
2:56:36
interactive lessons, all tailored to how you learn. If you're building something, Gemini 3 can turn your ideas into
2:56:43
reality. Sketch something. The AI builds it, describes something. The AI codes it show it an example. The AI makes your
2:56:50
version. And if you're planning something, a business, a project, an event, Gemini 3 can help you plan it
2:56:55
all. It can think through the steps, consider the risks, build the timeline, create the documents, do the research.
2:57:01
This is AI that works with you, not just for you. And if you want to scale your business, get more customers, and save
2:57:08
hundreds of hours with AI automation, you need to check out my AI profit boardroom, actually build systems that
2:57:14
grow your business. Inside you'll learn how to automate your marketing, generate leads on autopilot, and use AI to do the
2:57:21
work that used to take your entire team. So today, we're going to basically show you how to use Workspace Flows, which is
2:57:27
a new update from Google Gemini. And you can see over here, you can start using it. Now, if you want to toggle this on,
2:57:32
all you do is you click on flows at the top over here, and you make sure you have this toggled on inside your
2:57:39
workspace. All right. So, once you've done that, then you're going to go to workspace flows. If you've not seen this
2:57:45
before, this is basically a new update from Google and Google Gemini, and it's
2:57:51
an AI agent that can automate work across your different tasks. Now you've
2:57:56
got these AI agent workflows that you can use to create agents to automate
2:58:02
certain tasks and you can even connect these to third parties as well. So let me show you exactly how this works.
2:58:09
We're going to test this out. So if we go to see templates over here and then inside the C templates you can
2:58:15
start automating your work with the AI agents right and there's a bunch of different options here. So for example
2:58:21
you can get news headlines summarized daily. You could, for example, label emails with action items and you can get
2:58:28
a daily summary of unread emails. So, it basically automates a lot of different tasks and you can see which different
2:58:34
apps you would use inside each process. You could notify yourself for emails
2:58:40
with a keyword and they'll actually drop a message over to you. Here, you could get pre meeting briefs in the chat. As
2:58:47
you can see, you got all these different options for automating the AI agents and then starting to use these processes.
2:58:53
So, for example, if we say notify me about emails from key people. So, it's kind of like a really easy drag and drop
2:58:59
two-step process. And then we say, okay, any emails from Julian Goldie@gmail.com
2:59:06
and it has the words. So, you can actually limit those emails. So, then it will summarize and notify you in chat,
2:59:12
right? So, it will actually summarize what this person has said to you.
2:59:17
So you've got the prompts on the right hand side here. So it's like right here's what to summarize the email. Then you got the email thread over here.
2:59:23
Right? And then inside the additional instruction section, you can see the goal, the instructions and exactly what
2:59:30
it's going to do step by step. Right? So if we click on turn on, that will switch
2:59:36
the agent on or we can click on test run and just try it out. So let's do a test
2:59:41
run. So, we're going to say, okay, when I get an email, start this out. So, we're going to click on start now. And
2:59:48
we have to just make sure that we're selecting all emails as well,
2:59:54
I believe. There we go.
3:00:00
And then it's going to do a test run using existing data. So, you can see the email result received over here. We'll
3:00:06
click on start. And then it's all right. when I get an email. So, for example, this email received right here.
3:00:13
And we can see an example of the email too. For example, this is the email that's been sent. And this is the one
3:00:19
that's been used for the example test, right? Which is from LinkedIn. So, when
3:00:25
we receive this email, then it's going to actually use that flow to summarize
3:00:31
email. So, if we go back to uh flows.workspace.google.com, google.com.
3:00:36
You can now see that when we get that email, it's going to summarize the information and then it's right here's
3:00:42
what I think needs your response and it gives me like the FYI, right? So
3:00:48
you can see here for example it says a chat GPT 5.1 update introduces two distinct personalities and it's quite
3:00:54
interesting here because it's basically read through the whole email and then said here's the information that you need to know and then it sent a message
3:01:02
to Google chat and so inside Google chat we receive a message from
3:01:10
Gemini directly right so it's so easy to automate these workflows it's a lot easier than using something like this
3:01:16
reminds me like SAP IA, but it's a lot easier than using something like Zapia because it's pre-made, right? You got
3:01:23
these pre-made templates and also you don't need to connect any APIs. And as far as I'm aware, I think as long as
3:01:28
you're on the Google Workspace, it's just a feature that's included, right? So, I don't think you would pay any
3:01:34
extra for it. It's just kind of included if you're on like the Gemini. I think it' be pro plan that you're on right
3:01:40
there. So, really easy to set up. Let's try another one now. So, we've got that all ready to go. We can also go back to
3:01:46
my AI agents over here. We can edit, test, check the activity etc. So if we
3:01:52
go to activity, you can see this has been running and it says data available for 40 days. So it must be like
3:01:58
basically when you run these workflows, you'll have the history for the last 40 days
3:02:05
and then you can switch between all types, right? So for example, the tasks that are complete, in progress, had
3:02:10
issues and then you can refresh too. Pretty simple and easy to do. Now if we go back to the discover tab here, we can
3:02:17
test more stuff and we can also describe a task that we want to do, right? So for
3:02:22
example, you could say create an SEO blog each day
3:02:29
about the latest AI updates. So you could actually schedule a task and then it would generate that inside your
3:02:35
Google Workspace. And this could be, for example, setting a reminder, managing requests, catching up on yesterday, or
3:02:41
even just labeling your emails, right? So you can see the prompts you could use. So for example, every Friday, ping
3:02:47
me to update my tracker. Every time I get an email, decide if there's a question for me. And if there is, ping
3:02:52
me. Every morning, catch me up on yesterday's unread emails in chat. And
3:02:57
then if an email contains a question or an action item, label the email as to respond. So let's try this one. We're
3:03:04
going to click on every morning catch me up on yesterday's unread emails. Hit create. And then we're now generating
3:03:10
and creating the workflow. So, it's basically on a schedule. So, instead of okay,
3:03:16
every Monday at 8:00 a.m. do this, right? And we repeat that daily. Now, you could repeat it multiple times per
3:03:23
day as well. So, if you want to schedule the task a few times a day, you can if you really want to. And you can switch
3:03:28
between weekly, every other week, monthly, annually, every week, day, etc. And then under the show more section here, you can select the time zone. So,
3:03:35
that time zone is going to correlate to that time over here. Once you've done that, then you're going to switch over
3:03:40
to actions. And this is a prompt. Now, this is pre-filled in because we're using the
3:03:46
templates. You can always customize this however you want to. But the main point here is you can
3:03:52
automate the workflows. And again, it's pretty easy and simple set up, right? So, for example, filter the emails,
3:03:57
identify action items based on those emails, identify themes. You've basically got like an automated email
3:04:03
agent that can search for your emails, figure everything out, run through it. And the cool thing about this is it's
3:04:09
not going to cost you an extra subscription like most other AI super agents. And then additionally it's fully
3:04:14
automated for you and you can use the templates so that everything is kind of like working in one ecosystem. And then
3:04:20
you've got the formatting how to categorize stuff etc. Right from there you can also notify yourself in chat and
3:04:27
you can add a new step here if you want to as well. So that could be for example asking Gemini or asking a gem. Now, this
3:04:34
is interesting, too, because if you ask a gem, basically what you're doing is you're linking any sort of custom AI
3:04:41
agency you've built inside Gemini to your workflow. So, what do I mean by that? For example, if we go over to
3:04:47
Gemini here, let's say we're using, for example, SEO content writer to generate
3:04:53
content for our workflow, right? We could actually integrate that and automate it and build these custom gems.
3:05:02
And then what we can do is use that inside our workflow inside of Google flows
3:05:08
as an example of that. Let's go back. So you can see over here we have the ask a
3:05:16
gem option and then we can select our gem. We've got a bunch of options here and you can use these gems
3:05:23
to generate your outputs. Right now you can click on create or edit gems as well
3:05:28
and then edit your own gems over here and then you can enter a prompt plus add
3:05:34
variables. Right? So if you add a variable what you can actually do is tag in that step from the workflow. So you
3:05:40
can say right okay using the unread emails right. So if you click on this select
3:05:46
unread emails then we can ask the gem information about the information from
3:05:52
step one or step two. So we can reference different previous steps to build that workflow out. And then you
3:05:58
can also see here you can switch between what sources Gemini can use. So for example, web workspace and connected
3:06:04
apps or web only. Now what's pretty cool about this as well is that you could add a step here
3:06:11
and then you could say okay send an email or add labels or remove labels or draft a reply. Right? So you can
3:06:17
actually automate your emails, draft replies each time, and then use that to basically automate your processes here
3:06:23
as well. Really cool stuff. And the other cool thing about this as well, for us, we spend about I think it's like
3:06:29
$500 a month on Zapia requests, right? And it gets pretty expensive. Whereas
3:06:35
with this, you can create workflows for no extra price inside your Google
3:06:40
Workspace using the ultra plan instead. And then you don't need to worry about any issues. You can also link this with
3:06:46
your C CRM. So you got for example Salesforce over here, QuickBooks integrations, Mailchimp integrations,
3:06:52
Jira, Confluence. So you can link this to other different CRM too. And then you can additionally set up meetings and
3:06:58
that sort of thing. Overwhelming how much you can do with this and how easy it is to use. But it's really exciting.
3:07:04
Lots of cool stuff there. Again, you can see the activity. And the other cool thing here as well is you can actually
3:07:09
link this, right? So you can share this link with other people, create custom workflows, and then use those to share
3:07:16
that information with other people and get them involved, too. So it's absolutely endless what you can do with
3:07:22
this, but really fun to play with it, too. And if you go back to discover here, you
3:07:27
can again describe what you want, what you want to do, how you want to do it. And then the other cool thing here is
3:07:33
you've got different categories. So you could say, okay, I want to focus on improving our meetings. So we could get
3:07:40
premeating chats. We could send guest summaries. We could send summaries and action items. Get meeting reminders by
3:07:46
email and chat etc. You can also connect your team. So you could auto request team updates
3:07:52
weekly. Right? So for example, if there's certain updates and management reports you need from your team, you can
3:07:58
automatically request them using this over here. Right? And then you got tasks and actions. The only thing that I don't
3:08:05
like here is like it links a lot to Google Chat, but I don't know about you,
3:08:10
but I don't use Google Chat at all. So, I think like they're trying to encourage people to use it or they're just trying to find easier ways to work around maybe
3:08:17
some stuff that's missing inside the ecosystem of Google. But either way, it's pretty cool and there's so much you can do with this. All right, so thanks
3:08:24
so much for watching. If you want to get help, coaching, advice, etc., feel free
3:08:30
to get air profit boarding. basically the best community that I've ever built.
3:08:35
And essentially what you can do is join the AR profitable boardroom and inside there you get access to an awesome
3:08:41
community. So you can get an awesome community of people sharing, learning, growing
3:08:47
together all this different cool stuff. We actually shared a bunch of new training here on like how to get podcast for example. You can see you've got a
3:08:54
bunch of other stuff right here. So for example, Steve is sharing like how he created YouTube thumbnails as visual
3:09:00
hook. all sorts of amazing stuff and you can post inside the community super active cool people in there and you can
3:09:07
connect with a bunch of people who are serious about growing their business and automating with AI. You can also see
3:09:13
that it comes with all of our best classrooms and courses. So for example, we have a six week AI automation
3:09:18
masterass as you can see with all of these different sections here where you
3:09:24
can learn about AI. You can go from like beginner to expert. You can see how to build your first AI agent in under five
3:09:30
minutes. You also get all of my best automations on, for example, how to automate your emails, how we reach six
3:09:36
million people per month with X and Twitter, how we automate our shorts, how
3:09:42
we get sales from Instagram using shorts, and how we automate AI avatar videos along with loads of other cool
3:09:49
stuff here too. Top of that, you get our affiliate marketing course, lead generation automations, email and
3:09:54
content automations, NA10 templates, basically everything you need to automate your business. Google just
3:09:59
dropped an update to Gemini CLI that's going to blow your mind. I'm talking interactive shells running inside your
3:10:05
AI agent, custom/comands that automate your entire workflow, and a UI overhaul
Gemini CLI for Developers
3:10:11
that makes your terminal look like a sci-fi movie. This isn't just an update. This is a complete gamecher for
3:10:17
developers. And I'm about to show you exactly how to use it to save hours every single day. Gemini, I just got a
3:10:23
massive update and it's actually crazy. If you're a developer or you work in the terminal at all, you need to hear this
3:10:29
because what Google just did is kind of revolutionary. Let me break down what Gemini CLI is first. It's basically an
3:10:36
AI agent that lives inside your terminal. You can chat with it, ask it questions, analyze code, run commands,
3:10:41
but it can actually do stuff on your computer and it's open source. Now, here's where it gets wild. The new
3:10:47
updates make it feel like a completely different tool. I'm talking three major changes that are going to change how you
3:10:52
work. First up is interactive shell support. And this is huge. You can now run Vim inside Gemini CLI. You can run
3:10:58
HDOP. You can run gate rebase. All those interactive terminal apps that you normally can't use in AI tools. They
3:11:04
work perfectly. Now, here's why that matters. Before, if you wanted to edit a file, you'd have to exit Gemini CLI,
3:11:10
open Vim, make your changes, then come back. Now you can just open Vim right there inside the chat. Everything stays
3:11:16
in context. They're using something called pty which stands for pseudo terminal. Your keystrokes go straight
3:11:23
into the process. You can resize your terminal and the app adapts. Colors work. Syntax highlighting works. It's
3:11:30
like running a real terminal inside your AI agent. And this is enabled by default in version 0.9.0.
3:11:37
So if you upgrade, you get it automatically. But wait, it gets better. The second major update is a complete UI
3:11:43
overhaul. Version 0.15.0 just dropped and they rebuilt the entire
3:11:49
rendering system. The terminal doesn't flicker anymore. When you resize your window, nothing breaks. The input prompt
3:11:55
stays at the bottom where it should be. You can now click into the input prompt with your mouse. Before you had to use
3:12:01
arrow keys for everything. Now you just click. They added sticky headers so when
3:12:06
you're scrolling through a long output, the important header lines stay visible. You don't lose context. The rendering is
3:12:13
flicker-free now. Way smoother, way more stable. It actually feels professional and your history is preserved. Even
3:12:19
though they use alternate screen buffers, when you exit, your full chat history is still there. You can scroll
3:12:25
back through everything. Now, the third update is where things get really interesting. Custom/comands.
3:12:30
You can now create your own commands using TOML files. And these aren't just shortcuts. These are full-blown automation tools. Here's how it works.
3:12:38
You create a file in your Gemini commands folder. You write a prompt in that file. You can use placeholders like
3:12:43
args to pass in variables. And you can even run shell commands inside the
3:12:48
prompt. So imagine you type / plan build a new feature. Gemini CLI takes your
3:12:54
command, plugs it into your custom prompt, runs it, and gives you a full plan all from one command. Or you could
3:13:00
create a /re command that takes your git diff, analyzes it, and gives you code review feedback. One command. Done. You
3:13:07
can turn MCP prompts into slash commands. So if you're using a custom MCP server, all those prompts show up in
3:13:14
Gemini CLI automatically. You can even namespace your commands. So you could have slashgit commit and/git push
3:13:21
and/get review all organized in folders. This is huge for automation. You can
3:13:26
build workflows. You can create reusable prompts. You can save hours every single day by turning repetitive tasks into
3:13:32
oneline commands. In version 0.11.0, zero. They added more updates. You can
3:13:38
stream JSON output now. Perfect for automation. They added a markdown toggle. You can edit cued messages with
3:13:44
arrow keys. They improved web fetch for JSON APIs. And you can run slash commands non-interactively from scripts.
3:13:50
Now, let me tell you why this all matters. Before these updates, using an AI agent in the terminal meant constant
3:13:56
context switching. You'd ask a question, get an answer, then go do the work somewhere else. Now everything happens
3:14:03
in one place. You ask, you act, you iterate, all in the same context. The UI
3:14:08
improvements mean you actually want to use it. It's smooth, it's stable, feels good, and custom/comands mean you can
3:14:15
build your own tools. You're not limited to what Google gives you. You can automate your exact workflow. This is
3:14:21
what AI tooling should be. Flexible, powerful, actually useful. Now, before you go upgrade everything, let me give
3:14:27
you some tips. First, back up your config folder is in your home directory undergemini. Second, check your version
3:14:34
after upgrading. Run Gemini version to make sure you're on the latest third. Start simple with slash commands. Don't
3:14:41
try to build something crazy on day one. Make a basic command, test it, then add complexity. Fourth, review your TOML
3:14:47
files carefully, especially if you're running shell commands inside them. Don't run untrusted code. Um, you stay
3:14:53
updated, follow the GitHub repo, check the change log. They're shipping new features constantly. Now, here's
3:14:59
something you need to know. There were some security concerns reported about Gemini CLI.
3:15:05
Some articles mentioned a flaw that could let malicious commands run if you used untrusted files. So, be smart. Use
3:15:12
best practices. Don't run random code. And let me tell you where this is all going because the future of this tool is
3:15:18
wild. They're already working on click and drag scroll bars, better copy paste features, more UI polish. This isn't the
3:15:25
final version. This is just the start. And here's what I think is going to happen. Gemini CLI is going to become
3:15:31
the standard for AI agents in the terminal. Why? Because it's open source. It's flexible. It's powerful. And now
3:15:37
it's actually pleasant to use. If you're not paying attention to this tool, you're missing out because the
3:15:42
developers who adopt this early are going to have a massive edge over everyone else. They're going to be faster, more efficient, more productive
3:15:49
while everyone else is still copying and pasting code from chat GPT. Now, let me tell you about something that's going to
3:15:54
take your AI game to the next level. If you want to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of

right here, including, for example, how I make $348 per day. You can see that on the screen

right there. This is my actual YouTube dashboard. And we are using YouTube and
0:48
AI to make money online. And I'm going to show you exactly how that works step by step today. And if you have any
0:55
questions whilst you're on the live stream, feel free to ask. If you're watching the live stream back, just ask in the comments or join the AR profit
1:01
boardroom and I'll be happy to help you, my friends. All right, so here's an example. This is YouTube revenue over
1:08
the last month. You can see it's gradually increasing. Started off with $200 a day at the start of the month, and it has increased to $348
1:17
per day. Am I saying everyone's going to achieve that? Absolutely not. But even
1:22
if you achieve 10% of that, would you be happy with that? I think most people watching probably would be. Right?
1:27
That's an extra $12,000 per year. And I'm going to break down exactly how it works step by step. All right. Now,
1:33
we're also going to be talking about some other money-making opportunities I see with AI and Google Gemini in 2025.
1:41
Some of my latest strategies and new stuff. But essentially, what we're doing here, if you can see this channel, is
1:46
that we are creating content every single day. Now, I'm going to break this down into notes inside the AI money lab.
1:53
So, if you want the free notes from today, just go to the new AI automation section. And then we're going to add a
1:58
new page here. And this is going to be called how to make money with Gemini.
2:07
And we're just going to run through this, right? So, the first method that we use, what are we doing here? We're
2:12
using YouTube, right? And essentially what we're doing is attention equals money. Okay? So, the more attention you
2:18
get, the more people know about what you sell, the more money you're going to make, right? That's just typically how it goes. That's why, for example, people
2:24
pay so much money, millions of dollars for an ad at the Super Bowl. Why is that? It's because millions of people watch it and therefore it gets a lot of
2:30
attention, right? And so what we do every single day is we're creating these AI generated videos. We label them
2:36
inside the description as you can see and we label them as content. Now, if
2:42
you don't have a YouTube channel or you don't have a channel that is monetized
2:48
yet, no problem. I'll come on to exactly how to set that up in a second. So, if you go into the video on YouTube here,
2:55
we're going to scroll down and what you can see if we go to the show more section is that we always mark this as altered content. Now, it's really
3:02
important to do that because you want to be transparent with everyone watching. So, you know, YouTube will ask you, do
3:08
any of the following describe your content? Make a real person appear to say or do something they didn't do. Altered footage generates a realistic
3:15
looking scene that didn't occur, etc. If you're using AI generated videos, like you can see with this avatar model, then
3:22
you really want to make sure that you're transparent about that. We actually say within the first couple of minutes, I'm
3:27
Julian Goldis avatar, right? This is not the real me. And so when we're doing this, essentially, we create more
3:33
content daily. We generate AI avatar videos and we send traffic
3:42
to whatever makes us money. All right? So for example for us we have a SEO
3:48
agency and so if we send traffic to our SEO agency and we sell services about for example AI and then we send them to
3:55
our page our funnel about AI like you can see right here then people book in
4:01
calls we generate clients and we get retainers right so you don't even need a
4:07
monetized YouTube channel to make money with this because if you send traffic to your funnels where clients are going to
4:13
buy from you doesn't matter whether your channel is making revenue or not because you're going to get revenue from the clients you bring in. You see what I
4:19
mean? So that's one of the coolest things. And also when you're using AI, so let's say for example you're using
4:24
Gemini, right? Let's say for example a lot of our clients like they want to buy content from us because we also sell SEO
4:32
and we send traffic from our videos to our SEO funnel. So you can actually use Gemini to generate content that you can
4:39
then sell later as a service, right? And this works whether you're an agency, whether you're a freelancer, whether
4:45
you're on Upwork, whether you're on Fiverr, you can sell content and people genuinely buy it. Like we have a lot of
4:50
clients who buy AI content and human content from us, right? And so when we're doing this, essentially what we
4:57
can do, and this is a very simplified approach, but we can take a prompt like this one, which I use for SEO, and we
5:02
can use that to generate a personalized blog for our clients, and then we can use Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate the
5:09
content. All right. So, if we're scrolling down here, as you can see, we can then type in the keyword. So, let's say, for example, it was for me and I'm
5:16
like, I want to rank for the keyword make money with AI. What I can do is I can plug that prompt into Gemini. Gemini
5:23
is going to start creating the content as you can see. So, it's beginning to generate the content outline and the actual article. And then I can either
5:30
sign that sell that to clients who come to me or I can list that on places like Fiverr.com. Let me have a look at Fiverr
5:36
for example. We've And by the way, this is just stuff that I use, right? This is stuff that I've personally tested. So,
5:42
for example, you can see on fiverr.com, we actually have 2,000 reviews. We sold marketing services on there quite a
5:49
while ago. You can see we have lots of fivestar reviews as you can see right here. And we made thousands of dollars
5:54
from fiverr.com. Pretty crazy. How do we do it? We just list services on there. What can you sell? Content like I'm
6:00
showing you, right? If you actually look at the content itself, it's actually better than most human writers are going
6:06
to buy from if you hired someone. It would probably cost a lot more and it
6:12
would be worse than if you just use something like Gemini to generate the content. And you see how it links to our actual funnels here. So, it sends
6:18
traffic to our sales pages and everything else that's going to make us money. It's got some nice QA Q&A in
6:23
there, FAQs, etc. And so, this is a really easy and powerful way to generate content that you can sell to clients.
6:29
No, you don't just have to sell content. You could sell whatever service you want, right? It could be issues. It could be avatar videos. It could be, for
6:36
example, setting up custom GPTs. The main thing to understand here is that
6:41
anything you can automate with AI that actually creates value for your clients,
6:46
you can sell. Where do you sell it? You sell it, for example, via funnels inside your YouTube videos. Or you can go over
6:54
to somewhere like make a few listings, list, whatever. If you don't get sales within the first 24 hours, no problem.
6:59
Just set up a new listing and delete the old ones, right? And then also, if we have a look here, also sell on
7:07
upwork.com as well. Right? So, if we go to upwork.com and we have a look at this profile, this is me. We've made over a
7:13
million dollars on Upwork. As you can see, we've got some nice reviews on there. Got lots of clients saying good stuff about us. And so, this process
7:20
just works over and over again. We could sell SEO, we could sell AI avatar generation, NA10 automations, etc. on
7:27
any platform that we choose, whether that's, for example, Fiverr or Upwork.com. And this is just stuff that I've personally tested, showing you
7:33
stuff that actually works for me. So, let's get back to the video notes here. So, the first method is YouTube
7:40
attention equals money. You create content daily. You generate AI avatar videos and you send traffic to whatever
7:46
makes us money. So that could be affiliate marketing reviews as well. All
7:51
right. So you could do if you're in the AR profit boardroom for example, you can actually be a affiliate of our program
7:58
and if you're an affiliate of our program like for example I think Jesper Nielson was Jesper actually did a
8:04
podcast for me recently put the affiliate link in the description of his video and generated sales that way. All
8:11
right. And so you can become an affiliate of the AI profit boardroom. make videos about AI, put the affiliate links inside your videos. Boom, you send
8:17
traffic, you make sales, right? But the main point here is like you can use this for affiliate reviews, and then you can
8:24
also send that traffic to client funnels, for example, the AI automation
8:31
page or the booker sales call page here, right? And then finally, the other way
8:36
is of course if you have a monetized channel, which probably a lot of you don't have a monetized channel, but it doesn't take long to get there, then you
8:43
can actually start generating revenue that way with ads. All right? And so just to recap here, if we have a look at
8:50
this, there's many ways you can make money with YouTube AI avatars,
8:55
and the process is really easy and simple. Okay. Now, if you actually have a look here and we go into the AI profit
9:03
boardroom, which is our community link in the comments description, you can actually check out our AI avatar system
9:09
here that shows you exactly how to create these videos in a lot more depth. It goes way outside the scope of this
9:15
video. But if you want to learn how to create avatar videos like I do, if you want to get the systems that I personally use, then you can get that
9:22
all inside the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description. And we also
9:27
have a flash sale on this weekend. All right, we got three more spots left on
9:32
that. And basically inside the AR profit boredom you're going to get for example you're going to learn how to land
9:38
clients how to generate leads on autopilot how to launch your YouTube faceless channel how to deliver client
9:43
work and also our best school trainings our AI avatar system our Twitter method
9:49
automations for reaching seven people monthly our productivity system to kill overwhelm forever and SEO training worth
9:57
over $1,400 per year. All right. So, if you want to get these trainings, it's all inside the AI profit boardroom.
10:05
So, link in the comments description. Abdul says, "How can I make avatar videos for free without any budget?" We
10:12
actually have a training inside here. Let me show you this. It's inside the AR profit boardroom. So, if you go inside
10:18
here, let me find it now. Go inside the classroom and then it's in the content
10:25
section here. And we show you some free ways to do this as well. All right. So if you can't generate videos normally,
10:32
then you can learn how to create avatar videos for free using some of the
10:37
processes right here. All right. So link in the comments description for that. So
10:43
as we keep going through now, we've talked about YouTube and AI avatars. And bear in mind like if you can't create
10:49
avatar videos but you're on a budget, the other option that you have is that you can create blog posts or
10:57
social media content, right? And I'll show you the next method to do that. So
11:04
essentially again you're sending traffic to client funnels, right? So you're trying to get clients with the social
11:10
media content that you produce. And then for example, if we have a look here, this is my Twitter profile. And what we
11:18
do on our profile is we just create content and you can generate that for free using AI. I'll show you how to do
11:25
that in a second. You can post it and then you can send traffic to a client funnel like you can see right here. All
11:32
right. Again, you're using AI to get attention. And so like even if you don't have a budget for anything, you can do
11:37
this completely for free using Gemini. All right. So, if we set up a new chat here, we're going to type in, okay, for
11:44
example, create a short social media post
11:50
Dan Kennedy style updating us on the new
11:55
Google Gamma update. And I have much more complicated prompts that actually help you automate this
12:01
inside the profit boardroom, but I'll show you just a quick example whilst on the live stream. Now, wait for that to
12:06
load. And then you can see that creates like a little short blog post. Now we can actually say shorten that to
12:14
six lines or six to eight lines. And now you can see it creates a nice little
12:21
example right here. Right? So if you get the Google gamma update, it's just more noise. If your business lives or dies by an algorithm, you have a glorified holy,
12:28
right? So that's one of the easiest ways to do this. If you're using AI for hooks, what you can actually do is you
12:38
can use, let me find this example here. So, you can actually use something like
12:43
this. And then this is a system inside the AI money lab. And basically what we
12:48
can do is take the brief here. Go over to Gemini as you can see start new chat
12:56
and say create 10 direct response hooks for a video about and then insert your
13:04
topic. So let's say for example topic equals make money with Google Gemini.
13:11
And then you can start using that for generating hooks as well. All right. For example, it's got a bunch of ideas right
13:17
here. So, you could use, for example, Google just released a new AI that can build an entire business for you, right?
13:24
And you could use that for your social media content, for your videos, for your blog post, etc. No problem. Supporter
13:29
says, "Have you found an alternative to NAM that's really fully automated and free or cheaper? I don't like Opal." Yeah. So, if you go on to
13:37
the AR profit board in here and you type in locally, you'll discover how to host
13:45
NA10 locally and then you can start using it for free using this method right here. So, we basically show you
13:51
how to host NA10 locally if you're on a budget or if you want to do it for free and then we also show you how to get
13:56
free APIs as well inside Bay Profit. You can get it inside there. I think you just recently signed up against us.
14:02
Yeah, it's all inside there. If you want to learn how to use NAM for free blog content, you want to send that traffic
14:09
to your funnels. Let me take this prompt right here. We can take that. You go
14:15
inside here and then you've got a nice little prompt example. But basically, if
14:20
you have a look at X for example as well, this is pretty cool. So, if you go to monetization creator revenue sharing,
14:26
you can see how much money we're making. So, for example, we made $480 between September 27th to October the 11th, $723
14:35
between 13th of September to 26th of 27th of September, sorry. And $527
14:43
between August the 30th to September the 13th. And so, Twitter is pretty good for
14:49
generating revenue as well as you go along. All right? And you can use it like I'm showing you today to generate
14:55
more money, to get more customers, etc. Quick disclaimer here. All right, just want to say this video is for
15:01
educational andformational purposes only. I'm just sharing a method that work for me. All right, so these methods, they work for me. I've shown
15:08
you screenshot proof. Your results might vary. All right? So, I make no guarantees about income. I don't
15:14
guarantee success. And you've got to do your own due diligence. This is not like financial legal advice. So, just use it
15:20
at your own risk. All right, I'm just showing you examples of what work for me so that I can be 100% transparent with
15:26
you. All right, so as we go back now, let's have a look here. So, we've talked
15:32
about, for example, how to create blogger social media content. You're going to send that to traffic to client
15:38
funnels or to stuff yourself. How do you create the content? You use this prime right here. And that's pretty simple and
15:44
easy. And you've also got the YouTube AI avatar videos as well. Another cool way
15:50
and this is I call it like clipping and repurposing right this is a really cool
15:57
method but we've discovered recently so if you actually have a look for example on our Twitter we have multiple Twitter
16:03
accounts that we can create and scale right so for example if I switch accounts now we'll switch to this
16:10
account which has 610 followers and if we go to the analytics here you can see
16:16
that we still reach like 42,000 people a month, right? So, we reach 42,000 people
16:25
per month on this sub account that we don't even try on. You can see an example of the impressions right there. And you see it's growing over time
16:31
nicely as well. And you can actually scale this a lot. If you look at some of these tweets, what we're doing is we're
16:36
taking our original content, repurposing it, chopping it up, and then using that to generate more and more views. Right
16:43
now, if you go back to the analytics here, number one, we can make money from
16:48
the Twitter revenue. And number two, we generate more traffic to our funnels.
16:53
Number three, we're reaching 42,781 people. All right, so 42781
16:59
* 12, which is over a year. So, we're reaching an extra half a million people for very little extra work because we
17:06
just rinse and repeat the process on Google Gemini. Okay, so that works really well.
17:12
And then also what you can do is you can do similar sort of things on YouTube,
17:19
right? So for example, we have a channel that takes 2inut clips from our existing
17:25
videos from our live streams, takes the best stuff, focuses on what's the most valuable part of the video, and then
17:32
turns that into a nice little video. Like you can see right here. For example, if we have a look through the videos on this side, you can see we've
17:40
got this one. This was literally just from a couple of days ago. You can see it's nicely edited. It's like a better
17:45
version of the original stream. It covers the same topic, but it's just like a 2minute clip, right? It just
17:52
takes the best 2 minutes. And you can easily do that with something like a AI
17:57
video clipper, right? So, there's a bunch of video clippers out there. You've got like Opus Clips, you got Vizard, you've got Dscript as well.
18:04
Dcript can do this. And then you can create like highlight reels and highlight channels from your actual
18:10
channel. And you can edit those with AI as well. All right. The main thing here is you add more value to your old video
18:19
and then you generate more traffic to your funnels. How do you do it? You can
18:24
use Opus Clips or you can hire someone or you can use the script as well,
18:30
right? There's plenty of options for that too. So, there's many different ways and different methods that you can use this stuff. That's three different
18:37
ways. I've shown you proof of how I've made uh so much money with Google Gemini
18:42
using YouTube AI avatars. I've shown you the blog and social media content with Twitter and how we get paid for that.
18:49
I've also shown you the clickin and repurposing stuff as well. And that's basically how it all works. Now, if you
18:54
want to get the video from today, it's all inside the AI money lab, which is a free community with 30,700 people. Feel
19:00
free to get that link in the comments description. It's just designed to help people and connect people who are interested in AI where I would say the
19:08
99% of the value is inside the AI profit boardroom and we're actually running a
19:13
flash sale right now. So this weekend only you can see we're running a flash sale inside the classroom. You get five
19:21
weekly coaching calls. You can jump on the live coaching calls here. Ask for any help, get tech support, etc. You can
19:26
post inside the community. This is somewhere where I actually personally answer and connect and help people. So
19:33
you can see for example inside this I reply to people. I get back to you. It's
19:38
the only place I personally reply and respond to people. And then also inside the classroom here you can see all my
19:44
best automations. Right? So if you want to get like a very detailed breakdown of my process for publishing AI avatar
19:51
videos with a tutorial and an SP then feel free to get that inside the profit boarding. It also shows you my best
19:58
Twitter automations. So, if you want to get more clients and get more traffic based on what's working for me inside Twitter, you can get that right here.
20:05
We've got tons of other stuff like shorts automations, newsletter automations, Instagram stuff, and even a
20:10
six week master class that takes you from beginner to learning how to make your first dollar with AI like you can
20:16
see inside this video. And step by step, we just show you everything we know about AI. All right, so feel free to get
20:22
that link in the comments description. Like I said, we have flash sale on this
20:27
weekend. We only got three spots left and then it's gone. But basically, we're going to show you all of our best tradeins for AI to help you make money,
20:34
save time, and grow your revenues. And if you want us to just automate this stuff for you and do all this stuff for
20:39
you, then just book in a free AI automation session link in the comments
20:44
description. All right? And you can have a call with us about becoming a client. So, thanks so much for watching.
20:50
Appreciate as always and I will see you on the next one. Cheers. Bye-bye. Google just dropped something crazy and
20:56
it's going to change how you code forever. I'm talking about Gemini and VS Code working together in ways that feel
21:02
like science fiction. This isn't just another AI tool. This is a complete gamecher. Today I'm going to show you
21:08
how to code faster, smarter, and with way less headaches. Let's go. So, here's what just happened. Google rolled out
21:15
massive updates to Gemini Code Assist for VS Code. And I'm not talking about small tweaks. I'm talking about features
21:21
that make coding feel like cheating. Multiple chat sessions at once. Checkpoint roll backs that let you undo
21:27
AI mistakes. And the big one, the CLI now talks directly to your editor. It knows what you're working on. It sees
21:33
your code. It gives you suggestions in real time with diff views right inside VS Code. This is next level. And here's
21:40
the crazy part. Most developers have no idea this exists yet. While everyone's talking about Copilot, Google quietly
21:46
built something that might be even better. Gemini 2.5 is under the hood. Now the code it writes is sharper. The
21:53
suggestions are smarter and the context awareness. It actually understands your entire codebase. Now let me break down
21:59
why this matters. You know how most AI coding tools just guess. They don't really know your project. They give you
22:05
generic code that doesn't fit. Not anymore. Gemini Code Assist now has local codebase awareness. You can feed
22:11
it your workspace. You can feed it specific files. It learns your style. It learns your patterns. the suggestions it
22:17
gives you actually make sense for your project. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie,
22:24
CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the
22:30
latest AI updates. Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below. All right, let's talk about the
22:37
actual features because this is where it gets wild. First up, multiple chat sessions. You can run different
22:43
conversations at the same time. One for debugging, one for refactoring, one for new features, no more losing your train
22:49
of thought. No more switching context and forgetting what you were doing. Each chat stays open. Each chat stays
22:55
focused. Next checkpoint roll back. This one's in preview, but it's a lifesaver. The AI makes this suggestion, you apply
23:01
it, something breaks, now you can just roll back to before the change. One click, back to normal. No more manual
23:08
undo chains, no more get stash panic, just instant roll back. This alone saves hours of frustration. Then there's the
23:15
context uh filtering. You know how AI tools sometimes grab sensitive files or
23:20
they try to read your node modules folder with 50,000 files. Now you can use AI exclude orget ignore to tell
23:28
Gemini what to skip. Privacy stays locked down. Performance stays fast. You control what the AI sees. But here's
23:34
where it gets really interesting. You can attach code snippets to chat. You can attach terminal output to chat.
23:39
Think about that for a second. You get an error in your terminal. You copy it. You paste it into Gemini chat. It reads
23:46
the error. It looks at your code. It tells you exactly what's wrong. No more googling error messages. No more Stack
23:52
Overflow rabbit holes. Just instant answers. Now, let me show you the CLI integration because this is the part
23:57
that blew my mind. Google released updates to the Gemini CLI in August. It
24:03
now has deep integration with VS Code. What does that mean? You can ask Gemini questions from your terminal and it
24:09
knows what file you have open in the editor. It knows what code you have selected. It gives you suggestions that
24:15
match your context. Then it opens a diff view right in VS Code. Side by side, old
24:20
code on the left, new code on the right. You review it. You accept it or reject it. All without leaving your editor.
24:26
This is the future of coding. The AI doesn't just throw code at you. It shows you the changes. It explains the
24:32
changes. You stay in control. All right. Here's the part where I need to tell you something important. You need to check
24:38
out the AI profit boardroom. This is where I teach exactly how to use tools like this to grow your agency, your
24:44
business, your revenue. So, we've got members saving hundreds of hours with AI automation. We've got members landing
24:49
bigger clients because they're faster and better than the competition. The links in the description. Don't sleep on
24:55
this. Okay, back to Gemini. Let's talk setup because you need to see how easy this is. Open VS Code. Go to extensions.
25:03
Search for Gemini code assist. Click install. Done. Restart VS Code. Sign in
25:08
with your Google account, accept the permissions, that's it, you're live. If you're on the enterprise tier, you'll
25:14
connect your Google Cloud project and enable the APIs. But for most people, the free tier is enough to get started.
25:22
Now, let's talk about how you actually use this thing. Code completion is the basic mode. You start typing. Gemini
25:28
shows ghost text suggestions in line. You hit tab. It fills in the code. Fast, accurate, saves keystrokes, saves brain
25:34
power. But the real magic is in the commands. You can use slash commands to generate code. Type drop generate
25:41
function to calculate Fibonacci sequence. Boom. It writes the function. You get a diff view. You accept or
25:48
reject. Same thing with a fix for bugs. Doc for documentation. Simplify for refactoring. It's like having a senior
25:54
developer sitting next to you. The chat mode is where it gets conversational. You can ask why does this function crash
26:00
when input is zero? Gemini reads your code, spots the null pointer, explains the fix. You can use the ALF symbol to
26:07
tag specific files or snippets. Tell it to focus on one part of your codebase. The more context you give it, the better
26:13
the answers. Here's a pro tip. Use the checkpoint feature when you're experimenting. Make changes. See if they
26:19
work. If they don't, roll back. No risk, no downtime. Just fast iteration. And if
26:25
you've got sensitive files, set up exclude. Keep your secrets safe. Keep your API keys private. Gemini won't
26:31
touch what you tell it to ignore. Now, let's be real for a second. Is this perfect? No. Some users report that CSS
26:38
suggestions can be hit or miss. Sometimes the extension doesn't connect and you have to restart. Some features
26:44
are still in preview mode, so they might change. But here's the thing. Google is moving fast. They're updating every
26:50
month. Gemini 2.5 just rolled out. The models getting smarter. The features are getting better. If you're not paying
26:56
attention, you're going to fall behind. Let me tell you what this actually means for your workflow. You're probably
27:02
spending hours every week on boring stuff, writing boilerplate code, adding documentation, fixing small bugs,
27:08
refactoring messy functions. That's time you're not spending on the hard problems, the stuff that actually
27:13
matters. Gemini handles the boring stuff. You focus on the creative stuff. That's how you work 10 times faster. And
27:20
here's something nobody talks about. The diffview feature changes everything. Most AI tools just dump code in your
27:26
file. You accept it. You pray it works. Not here. You see exactly what's changing line by line. You understand
27:32
the changes before you commit them. That means fewer bugs, fewer rollbacks, fewer oh no moments at three in the morning.
27:38
The multiple chat sessions thing is bigger than it sounds. Think about your normal day. You're building a feature.
27:44
You hit a bug. You need to refactor something. You want to add tests. That's four different tasks, four different
27:49
contexts. Before you'd lose track, you'd mix things up. Now you keep each task in its own chat. Each chat remembers the
27:56
context. You switch between them instantly. Your brain stays organized. Your work stays clean. Here's what blows
28:02
my mind about the local codebase awareness. The AI actually learns your code, not generic code from the
28:09
internet. Your patterns, your naming conventions, your architecture. The more you use it, the better it gets at
28:15
predicting what you need. It's like training a junior developer. Except this one learns in days, not months. And the
28:21
source citation feature, that's trust. When Gemini suggests code, it tells you
28:26
where it came from, what documentation it used, what examples it referenced. You're not flying blind. You can verify.
28:33
You can learn. You can understand why the AI made that choice. That's the difference between a tool you trust and
28:38
a tool you guess with. The terminal output integration is a game changer for debugging. You know that moment when
28:44
something breaks and the error message is 10 lines long. You copy it. You paste it into Google. You click five Stack
28:50
Overflow links. You try three solutions. Nothing works. Now you paste it into Gemini chat. It reads the error. It
28:57
reads your code. It tells you the exact line that's broken and exactly how to fix it. 5 minutes instead of 5 hours.
29:04
Here's what I want you to understand. AI coding assistants aren't a gimmick anymore. They're essential. If you're
29:09
still coding without one, you're working twice as hard for half the results. Gemini code assist with VS Code gives
29:15
you speed. It gives you accuracy. It gives you control. You write better code in less time. You debug faster. You ship
29:21
faster. That's more projects, more clients, more money. The developers who learn this stuff now are going to
29:27
dominate. The ones who ignore it are going to get left in the dust. It's that simple. So, here's what you do next.
29:33
Install Gemini Code Assist today. Play with it, break it, see what it can do. Then come back and tell me in the comments what you built with it. I read

30:16
Code just made it real. Don't get left behind. Install it, learn it, use it, and I'll see you in the next one. Google
30:22
just leaked Gemini 3.0, and it's way bigger than anyone thought. We're
30:28
talking about AI that can see, think, and code better than anything else out there. This thing might actually beat
30:34
GPT5 before it even comes out. But here's the thing, not everything you're hearing is
30:39
real. So today, I'm breaking down every single leak. What's real, what's fake, and what this actually means for you.
30:46
Stick around because the camera coach feature alone is going to blow your mind. All right, let's get into this
30:51
because the internet is going crazy right now. Code leaked from Google's own repos, screenshots claiming Gemini 3.0
30:59
beats everything, and rumors about features that sound too good to be true. So, what's actually happening here? I
31:05
spent the last few days digging through commit logs, leaked benchmarks, and Reddit threads to figure out what's
31:11
real. And let me tell you, some of this stuff is legit exciting, but some of it total hype. By the end of this video,
31:17
you'll know exactly what to believe and what to ignore. Plus, I'll show you the one feature that could change everything
31:23
if it's real. Let's start with what we actually know for sure. Before we dive into the leaks, you need to understand
31:29
where Gemini is today. Because a lot of people don't even know what Gemini can do right now. Google's been quietly
31:34
rolling out some crazy updates that nobody's talking about. First off, Gemini Live is now free on Android and
31:40
iOS. That means you can use your camera and share your screen while talking to the AI. Think about that for a second.
31:45
You can literally show Gemini what you're looking at and have a conversation about it for free. That's already wild. There's also a temporary
31:53
chat mode coming. Basically, ephemeral chats that don't save to your history. Great if you're working with sensitive
31:58
info. Now, here's where the leak stuff starts because buried in Google's code, people found something interesting.
32:04
References to Gemini Beta 3.0 Pro and Gemini Beta 3.0 Flash. That's not an
32:10
accident. That's Google testing new models internally. And when code references leak, it usually means
32:16
something's coming soon. But let me be clear, this is speculation based on code. It's not confirmed by Google yet.
32:23
So everything I'm about to tell you could change. Keep that in mind. All right, here's where things get interesting. Let me walk you through
32:29
every major leak and what it means. First up, those code references I mentioned, multiple sources found Gemini
32:35
Beta 3.0 Pro and Gemini Beta 3.0 Flash in Google CLI repos. This isn't some
32:42
random tweet. This is actual code that developers can inspect. When you see
32:47
beta versions in code, it means testing is happening. Pro and Flash are the naming conventions Google uses. Flash is
32:54
faster and cheaper. Pro is more powerful but costs more. So, we're probably looking at two versions of Gemini 3.0.
33:01
Makes sense, right? Now, let's talk about the benchmark screenshots. People are sharing images claiming Gemini 3.0
33:08
scores higher than GPT5. Here's my take. Be skeptical. Benchmark leaks happen all
33:13
the time before launches. Sometimes they're marketing stunts. Sometimes they're real but cherrypicked. The
33:18
problem is we don't know the methodology, what tasks were tested, what prompts were used. Without that info, these scores mean nothing. Before
33:25
I continue, if you want to scale your business and save hundreds of hours with AI automation, check out my AI profit
33:31
boardroom at the link in the description. It's the best place to learn how to use AI to get more customers and grow faster. So yeah,
33:38
Gemini 3.0 zero might be incredible, but don't trust screenshots without verification. Now, here's where the
33:45
leaks get really exciting. People are speculating about much larger context windows. We're talking double or triple
33:50
the current size. That would let Gemini handle entire books in one conversation. Imagine uploading a 300page document and
33:58
asking questions about it. Or analyzing your entire codebase at once. That's the kind of capability we're talking about.
34:04
And honestly, it makes sense because every major AI company is racing to
34:10
expand context. Windows, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, everyone's doing it.
34:15
So, this rumor has legs. Then there's the multimodal integration rumors. Right now, Gemini can handle text, images, and
34:22
video, but supposedly 3.0 will mix them way more smoothly. Like, you could edit
34:28
a photo while talking about it or ask Gemini to change a video based on your conversation. real-time back and forth
34:34
with visual content. If that's true, it's a huge leap forward because most AIs still treat each modality
34:41
separately. But here's the leak that got me excited. Stronger coding and tool
34:46
use. The rumors say Gemini 3.0 will write code better than anything else.
34:52
Plus, it will integrate with external tools seamlessly. Think about what that means for developers. An AI that can
34:58
write code, debug it, and connect to APIs automatically. That's not just helpful. That's a productivity
35:03
multiplier. But there's a catch. Better coding ability means more potential for errors if you don't know what you're
35:09
doing. So you So you'd still need to understand what the AI is building. Now let's talk about device integration.
35:15
This is where Google's hardware advantage comes in. There are leaks about something called Camera Coach. It would work on Pixel phones. Basically,
35:22
Gemini would guide you in real time while you're taking photos. It would suggest framing, lighting, and
35:27
composition like having a professional photographer in your pocket. That's the kind of feature only Google can build
35:33
because they control the hardware and it shows where AI is heading. Not just chat bots on screens, but AI embedded in
35:40
every device you use, your phone, your watch, your camera, all working together with AI assistance. Now, let's talk
35:47
money because there are also leaks about new subscription tiers. Supposedly, Google is testing something called AI
35:54
Premium Plus or Pro Tiers. Right now, you can use Gemini for free or pay for Gemini Advanced, but these leaks suggest
36:00
more options coming. Maybe different tiers for different use cases. Casual users versus power users versus
36:06
enterprise. Makes sense from a business perspective. But here's what nobody's talking about. More subscription tiers
36:12
could mean features get locked behind pay walls. So, the free version might stay limited while the good stuff costs
36:17
money. That's speculation on my part, but it's how these things usually go. Let's get real about what these features
36:23
would actually do. Because hype is one thing, practical impact is another. If Gemini 3.0 has much larger context
36:30
windows, here's what changes. You could give it your entire business documentation, every process, every
36:35
workflow, every policy, and then just ask questions. No more digging through files. No more forgetting where
36:40
something is. The AI knows everything about your business. That's massive for entrepreneurs and teams. Now, think
36:46
about the multimodal stuff. If you can edit images and videos through conversation, content creation becomes
36:52
way faster. You could literally describe what you want and watch it happen. No more learning complicated software. No
36:58
more hours in Photoshop or Premiere. Just tell the AI what to do. For creators, that's a complete shift in
37:04
workflow. The coding improvements are huge, too. Right now, you might use AI to write small code snippets. But if 3.0
37:10
can handle entire projects and integrate tools, you could build full applications with AI. That means nontechnical people
37:17
can suddenly create software. You just describe what you want and the AI builds it. We're talking about democratizing
37:23
software development. That's not hype. That's a fundamental change in who can build technology. The device integration
37:29
stuff is interesting because it's so personal. Camera coach on your phone means AI helping you in real time, not
37:36
after you take the photo, during. That's the difference between a tool and an assistant. Tools wait for you to use
37:42
them. Assistants actively help while you work. And that's where AI is heading. Always on, always helping, always aware
37:48
of context. Let's wrap this up with action steps. First, subscribe if you
37:53
haven't already because I'm tracking all this stuff for you. When Gemini 3.0 actually launches, I'll break it down.
38:00
I'll test it. I'll show you what works and what doesn't. Second, comment below. Tell me which leaked feature you're most
38:05
excited about. Is it the large context windows, the coding improvements, camera coach? Let me know because I read every
38:10
single comment. Third, if you want to actually make money with AI right now, not 6 months from now, check out the
38:16
free AI money lab. Inside you get 50 plus free AI tools and 200 plus chat GPT
38:22
SEO prompts. You'll learn how to make money with AI agents. Get access to more than 1,000 plus free N8N workflows, plus

a full blueprint to generate thousands of leads free with AI. You also get a free AI community, free AI course, and
38:38
proven AI case studies. Everything you need to start making money with AI today. Link is in the description.
38:43
Fourth, if you're serious about scaling your business with AI, join my AI profit boardroom. It's the best place to learn
38:50
how to get more customers and save hundreds of hours with AI automation. We
38:55
go way deeper than these YouTube videos. You get access to advanced training templates and a community of people
39:02
actually building with AI. Link is in the description for that, too. Look, the bottom line is this. Gemini 3.0 might be
39:09
incredible when it comes out or it might be overhyped. We don't know yet. But what we do know is AI is changing
39:15
everything. And you need to be part of that change. Not watching from the sidelines, not waiting for permission,
39:21
building, learning, and moving forward. That's how you win. So, let's do this together. I'll keep bringing you the latest updates. You keep taking action.
39:28
Deal. All right. That's it for today. I'll see you in the next one. Peace. Today, I'm going to show you something that just dropped and it's absolutely
39:35
crazy. Google just released the Genkit extension for Gemini CLI and it's a
39:40
complete gamecher. I'm talking about building AI apps in minutes instead of hours. This thing writes entire AI
39:47
workflows for you. It debugs your code automatically. It understands Genkit
39:53
patterns better than most developers. And the best part is completely free. I'm going to install it right in front of you and build a working AI app in
40:00
under five minutes. No fluff, no theory, just pure hands-on demo. And Julian Goldie reads every comment. So make sure
40:06
you comment below what AI tool you want me to cover next. Hey, if we haven't met
40:11
already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get
40:18
more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Let me tell you why this matters. If you've
40:24
been building AI apps with Jenkit, you know it can be a pain. You're writing flows. You're setting up evaluators.
40:31
You're debugging traces. It takes forever. But now, Gemini CLI can do all of that for you. It understands Genkit
40:38
inside and out. It scaffolds code. It generates tests. It fixes bugs by reading your traces. And here's the
40:44
thing, most people don't understand. The companies making real money with AI right now aren't the ones with the best
40:50
ideas. They're the ones who can ship fast. They prototype in hours instead of
40:55
weeks. This extension gives you that speed and speed is the only competitive
41:01
advantage that matters in 2025. So what exactly is this Jenkit extension? Let me
41:06
break it down simple. Jenkit is Google's framework for building AI apps. It's basically Firebase for AI. You write
41:13
flows which are like AI workflows. You set up evaluators to test if your AI is working right. It's powerful but it's
41:20
complex. The Jenkit extension turns Gemini CLI into a Jenkit expert. You can
41:25
ask it to write flows and it knows the exact patterns to use. You can show it a broken trace and it tells you exactly
41:31
what's wrong. It's context aware. It knows your project structure. It reads your code. Now, before I show you the
41:37
install and demo, let me tell you what you need. You need node and px installed. That's it. You need Gemini
41:43
CLI installed and authenticated. And that takes like 2 minutes. There's no complex setup. No dependencies from
41:50
hell. Just install and go. And real quick, if you want to scale your business and save hundreds of hours with
41:55
AI automation, you need to check out my AI profit boardroom. This is where the real AI builders hang out, you get
42:01
access to AI money-making strategies. You get 1,000 plus free workflows. You get direct access to me and my team.
42:07
Link is in the description. All right, let's let's install this thing. Open your terminal first. Make sure you have
42:13
Gemini CLI. If you don't, run this command. npm install-g Google/Gemini-
42:18
CLI at latest. Hit enter. Wait for it to install. Takes like 30 seconds. Now,
42:24
here's the magic command. Gemini extensions install https colon/github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/jenkit.
42:34
That's it. One command. The extension downloads and installs automatically. You'll see a success message. It takes
42:40
maybe 10 seconds. Want to confirm it worked? Run Gemini extensions list. You'll see Genkit in the list. That
42:47
means it's active and ready. Now, your Gemini CLI understands Jenkit. Here's where it gets insane. Let me show you
42:52
what this thing can actually do. I'm going to give it a prompt and watch it build a working Jenkit flow from
42:57
scratch. Ready? Here's the prompt. Write a flow that tests an input string for profanity. Watch what happens. The CLI
43:05
thinks for a second. Then it scaffolds the entire flow. It writes the function. It sets up the input schema. It adds the
43:11
logic to check for profanity. It includes proper error handling. This isn't just copy paste code. This is
43:17
production ready. But here's what blows my mind. Look at what else it added. It generated a sample evaluator. It created
43:24
a test data set. It even added comments explaining how to run it. This is the kind of code a senior developer would
43:31
write. And it took 10 seconds. Let me show you another example. Let's say I want an evaluator with a sample data set
43:37
for this flow. I just ask write an evaluator with a sample data set for my
43:42
profanity checker flow. The CLI looks at my existing code. It understands the flow structure. It generates test cases.
43:49
It creates the evaluator function. This is contextaware code generation at its finest. Now, here's where it gets really
43:56
powerful. Debugging. Let's say I ran this flow and got a weird result. I don't know what's wrong. I just tell the
44:02
CLI. The last invocation of profanity checker flow produced a weird result.
44:07
Can you fix it? The CLI reads my trace data. It analyzes the flow execution. It
44:13
spots the problem. Then it suggests the exact fix. It might show me a code difference. It might rewrite the
44:18
function. This is like having a debugging expert on call 247. And this works because of how Jenkit MCP tools
44:25
integrate with the CLI. The extension can read your traces. It can analyze your flow data. It understands the
44:32
execution context. So when something breaks, it doesn't just guess. It knows exactly what went wrong. Let me give you
44:38
some real world use cases. Say you're building a content moderation system. Normally this takes days. With this
44:43
extension, you scaffold everything in an hour. You ask for flows. You ask for tests. The CLI does the heavy lifting.
44:50
Now, let me give you some tips because there are a few things you need to know. First, always run your Genkit MCP server
44:57
locally for full functionality. The extension works best when it can read your traces and context. Second, keep
45:04
your API keys out of your repo. Use environment variables. Use a git in your
45:09
file. The extension generates secure code, but you still need to handle secrets properly. Third, remember this
45:16
extension is open source. You can inspect the code on GitHub. If you find a bug or want a feature, submit an
45:22
issue. Fourth, if you're using the hosted Gemini code assist with the free license, be aware of rate limits. If
45:28
you're building production apps, you might want to use a Vertex AI key for higher usage. Here's something most
45:34
people miss. You can use this extension to generate tests and then run them automatically in CI. You ask the CLI to
45:40
write evaluators. It generates the test code. You add it to your test suite. Now, every deploy runs those tests. Let
45:47
me tell you why this matters for making money. The businesses winning with AI right now are the ones who can test
45:53
ideas fast. They build a prototype in a day. They test it with real users. If it
45:58
works, they scale. If it doesn't, they pivot. This extension gives you that speed. Say you have an idea for an AI
46:05
service. Without this tool, you spend a week building in the first version. With this tool, you build it in an afternoon,
46:11
you test it the next day, you're in market while your competitors are still writing code. And if you're an agency
46:17
owner or freelancer, this tool multiplies your output. You can take on more clients because you deliver faster.
46:23
You can charge more because your quality is higher. This is leverage. Now, let me show you how to think about your next
46:28
steps. First, install the extension right now. Don't wait. Takes 30 seconds. Second, pick one genkit flow you need to
46:35
build. Ask the CLI to generate it. See what happens. Third, experiment. Ask it
46:41
to generate complex flows. Ask it to debug messy traces. Push it. The more
46:46
you use it, the more you'll find creative applications. Fourth, integrate this into your workflow. Make it part of
46:52
how you build. Every time you need a flow, start with the CLI. Every time you hit a bug, ask the CLI. Make it
46:58
automatic. And fifth, share what you learn. Comment below with the craziest flow you want me to build and test. I'll
47:05
make a follow-up video showing it in production. Let's build together. Here's the bottom line. AI development is
47:11
getting faster, and this tool is proof. What used to take days now takes hours. What used to take hours now takes
47:17
minutes. The people who win are the ones who adopt tools like this first. So, here's what you do next. Number one, go
47:24
install the extension. Link is in the description. Number two, join my AI profit boardroom where we talk about
47:29
tools like this every day. You get access to over 1,000 workflows. You get AI money-making strategies. Link is in
47:37
the description. And number three, join the free AI money lab with Julian Goldie. Inside, you'll get 50 plus free
47:44
AI tools and 200 plus chat GPT SEO prompts. You'll learn how to make money
47:49
with AI agents. You'll get 1,000 plus free workflows. You'll get a full blueprint to generate thousands of leads
47:55
free with AI. You also get a free AI community, free AI course, and proven AI case studies. Link is in the
48:02
description. This is the kind of content we're bringing you every single day. Real tools, real demos, real results. If
48:08
you got value from this, smash that like button. Subscribe if you haven't already, and comment below what AI tool
48:15
you want me to cover next. Remember, the people making money with AI aren't the ones with the best ideas. They're the
48:20
ones with the best tools and the fastest execution. This extension gives you both. So, go install it, build
48:27
something, ship it, and I'll see you in the next video. Wo AI tools are fighting for the top spot right now. One crushes
48:34
research and gives you real sources. The other one can actually control your browser like a human. I tested them both
48:39
side by side, and the results shocked me. By the end of this video, you'll know exactly which one to use to make
48:45
more money. Let's go. So, here's the deal. Everyone's talking about AI in 2025, but most people are using the
48:51
wrong tools for the wrong jobs, and that's costing them time. and that's costing them money and that's keeping
48:56
them stuck. Today I'm breaking down Gemini versus Perplexity.
49:01
These are the two biggest AI tools right now that aren't chat GPT and they're totally different. One is built for live
49:07
research and citations. The other is built for deep thinking and automation and if you pick the wrong one for your
49:12
task, you're going to waste hours. I'm going to show you exactly what each one does best. I tested them both with the
49:19
same prompts, same tasks side by side, and the winner surprised me because it's not about which one is better overall.
49:25
It's about which one wins for what you're trying to do. Let me give you the bottom line right now. If you need fast
49:30
research with real sources and links, perplexity wins. If you need complex reasoning, image analysis, or browser
49:37
automation, Gemini wins. But most people need both, and I'll show you when to use each one. Here's why this matters right
49:44
now. Gemini just released version 2.5. This thing has a thinking mode that reasons
49:49
through problems step by step. It also has computer use. That means it can actually control a browser, open tabs,
49:56
click buttons, fill out forms like a real human. That's insane. No other AI can do that right now except Claude and
50:03
Gemini. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, COO of SEO agency, Goldie Agency. Whilst
50:11
he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Perplexity just
50:17
upgraded their mobile app and made their citations way better. They're all in on live web retrieval, real-time facts,
50:24
clickable sources. That's their whole game. They want to replace Google for research. So, you've got two totally different approaches here. One is trying
50:31
to be your research assistant. The other is trying to be your automation assistant. And both are getting really
50:36
good at what they do. Let me walk you through exactly what I tested. I ran five tests. Live facts and
50:43
citations, complex reasoning, image understanding, browser automation, and creative writing. Each test shows you
50:50
exactly where each tool shines and where it falls apart. All right, test number one, live facts and citations. This is
50:57
where Plexity is supposed to dominate. I asked both tools the same question. Summarize today's top news about AI and
51:04
give me three sources with links. Perplexity came back in seconds. clean answer, three clickable links. Each
51:10
source was labeled right next to the claim. I could verify everything instantly. That's exactly what you want
51:15
when you're doing research or writing content or checking facts. Gemini gave me an answer, too. But here's the thing.
51:20
The sources weren't as clear. It pulled from its knowledge base, plus some web retrieval, but the citations weren't in
51:27
line like Perplexity. I had to dig to find where the info came from. For quick factchecking, Perplexity is the clear
51:33
winner. If you're a journalist or researcher or content creator who needs verifiable sources fast, use perplexity.
51:40
End of story. Test number two, complex reasoning and structured output. I asked
51:45
both tools to plan a four-week study schedule to learn Kubernetes for a beginner with daily tasks and
51:51
checkpoints. This is where Gemini 2.5 flexed. It gave me clean headers, numbered lists, weekby-eek breakdown,
51:58
daily tasks, checkpoints at the end of each week. Everything was organized perfectly. The step-wise reasoning was
52:05
clear. I could follow the logic. Complexity gave me a decent answer, but it wasn't as structured. The formatting
52:11
was messier, and it didn't break things down as clearly. For complex planning tasks or when you need clean, structured
52:18
outputs, Gemini wins, hands down. Now, here's where it gets crazy. Test number three, image understanding. I uploaded a
52:25
screenshot of a website with some errors. I asked both tools to explain what was wrong and suggest fixes. Gemini
52:32
crushed this. It identified the errors immediately, explained what each one meant, suggested specific fixes. The
52:40
multimodal reasoning was impressive. It understood the context of the image, and gave actionable advice. Perplexity
52:46
tried, but it's not built for this. The image analysis was basic. It missed details. For anything involving images
52:53
or screenshots or diagrams, Gemini is miles ahead. And speaking of getting ahead, if you want to save hundreds of
52:59
hours and scale your business with AI automation, you need to join the AI profit boardroom. This is where I share
53:04
the exact workflows and tools my team uses to run our seven figureure agency. We automate lead generation, content
53:10
creation, client outreach, everything. You'll get access to proven AI systems that actually make money, not theory,
53:16
real results. The link is in the description. Join us inside. All right, back to the tests. Test number four,
53:23
this is the one that blew my mind. Browser automation. I asked Gemini to perform a real browser task. Extract
53:30
product prices from a website. Gemini 2.5 has this computer use feature. It
53:35
can actually interact with web pages, click buttons, type in forms, navigate sites. I watched it work in real time.
53:41
It opened the page, found the products, extracted the prices, put them in a list, all automatically. This is a
53:48
gamecher for automation. Imagine using this for data scraping, form filling, testing websites, monitoring
53:53
competitors. The use cases are endless. Perplexity can't do this. It's not built for automation. It's built for answers.
54:00
So, if you need an AI that can actually perform tasks on the web, Gemini is the only option right now. But here's the
54:06
catch. This feature has limitations. It's not perfect yet. Sometimes it makes mistakes. You have to supervise it. But
54:12
the fact that it exists at all is crazy. We're watching AI evolve into actual agents that can complete tasks for you.
54:20
Test number five, creative writing. I asked both tools to write a 90-second viral script about AI safety in a
54:26
sarcastic tone. Both did well here. Perplexity was concise, punchy, good tone. Gemini was creative, too. Slightly
54:33
longer, more detailed. Honestly, this one was close. Both can handle creative tasks, but Gemini had slightly better
54:39
formatting and structure. For pure creativity, it's a tie. Use whichever interface you like better. Now, let's
54:44
talk speed and user experience. I tested both on desktop and mobile. Perplexi's mobile app is fast, really fast. The
54:51
recent updates made it smoother, easier to navigate. Citations are clearer on mobile now, too. Gemini's desktop
54:57
experience is excellent. The formatting is clean. Headers and tables look great. But on mobile, it's a bit clunkier. Not
55:02
bad. Just not as optimized as Plexity. So, here's my final verdict. Which tool should you use? It depends on what
55:08
you're doing. Use Perplexity if you need live facts, verifiable sources, quick
55:14
research, or citation heavy content. If you're a journalist, researcher, student, or content creator who needs to
55:20
back up claims with real links, Perplexity is your tool. Use Gemini if
55:25
you need complex reasoning, structured outputs, image analysis, or browser automation. If you're building building
55:31
systems, automating workflows, analyzing visuals, or planning complex projects, Gemini is your tool. And honestly, most
55:38
people should use both. I do. I use Plexity for quick research and fact-checking. I use Gemini for
55:44
planning, automation, and multimodal tasks. They complement each other perfectly.
55:49
The mistake most people make is trying to use one tool for everything. That's like using a hammer for every job. You
55:55
need the right tool for the right task. Now you know which is which. Here's what I want you to do. Pick one task you're
56:01
working on right now. Choose the tool that fits. Test it. See the difference. Then come back and tell me in the

56:57
Google dropped Gemini 2.5 and it's completely changing how search works. Plus, they added this crazy new feature
57:04
called computer use. I'm going to show you one free trick that will make Gemini site your content instead of your
57:10
competitors. No paid tools, no complicated stuff, just one simple change. And the crazy part, most people
57:16
have no idea this even exists yet. So, if you do this today, you're going to be way ahead of everyone else before they
57:22
even figure out what's happening. Okay, so Google's new AI called Gemini 2.5 is
57:28
now reading websites and deciding what content to show people. And here's the thing, it's not ranking websites the
57:34
same way Google used to. There's this whole new thing called AI overviews. Basically, Gemini reads a bunch of
57:40
websites, pulls out the best parts, and then puts them all together into one big answer at the top of Google. And if your
57:46
content gets picked, you show up right there at the very top before anyone else. That's huge. But most people's
57:53
websites are completely invisible to Gemini. And I'm going to show you exactly how to fix that in the next few
57:59
minutes. This works for blog posts, YouTube videos, landing pages, whatever.
58:04
And I've tested this with my own content and it works. So stick around because this is brand new and you're getting in
58:09
early. All right. First thing you need to do is a quick SER audit. This takes 10 to 20 minutes and it's going to show
58:16
you exactly what Gemini sees when it looks at your keyword. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital
58:22
avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's
58:28
helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Julian Goldie reads
58:33
every comment, so make sure you comment below. So, open up Gemini and paste this prompt. You are an SEO researcher for
58:39
the keyword rank number one on Gemini 2.5 free SEO trick. Analyze the top 10 Google results for each result list.
58:46
Page title H1, main headings H2H3, JSON LD schema present, the short excerpt
58:52
shown in search results, content type howto, list, guide, and publish date. Then give me five content gaps I can
58:59
exploit and a recommended compact outline, five to seven sections that would most likely be used for an AI
59:06
overview. Now, hit enter, and Gemini is going to do all the research for you. It's going to show you what headings the
59:11
top pages are using, what schema they have, and most importantly, what gaps you can fill. Because here's the thing,
59:18
AI overviews pull concise chunks from multiple pages. So, if you can identify what's missing from the top results, and
59:24
you add that to your page, Gemini is going to grab your content instead. This is huge, and it's completely free.
59:29
You're basically reverse engineering what Gemini wants to see. All right, step two. Pick your keywords. You need
59:37
one main keyword and two longtail variations. And you want phrases that have low competition but high
59:43
opportunity. So go back to Gemini and paste this prompt. Suggest 20 longtail
59:48
queries related to Gemini 2.5 SEO. Group them by intent, informational versus transactional, and highlight three low
59:55
competition, high opportunity phrases I should target for a single tutorial video article. Include suggested title
1:00:02
tags and three thumbnail hooks for the main phrase. Hit enter and boom, Gemini is going to give you 20 keyword ideas,
1:00:08
all grouped by intent and it's going to tell you which three to focus on. Plus, it's going to give you title tag ideas
1:00:15
and thumbnail hooks. This saves you hours of work. Want to scale your business the smart way? Book a free SEO
1:00:21
strategy session. We'll show you exactly what's working right now and how to scale it fast. Links in the comments and
1:00:27
description. Now, here's why this matters. When you pick the right keywords and you structure your content
1:00:33
around them, Gemini knows exactly what your page is about and it's way more likely to pull your content into an AI
1:00:39
overview. Now, here's where it gets really powerful. You're going to add FAQ schema to your page. This is basically
1:00:45
code that tells Gemini, hey, this is a question and this is the answer. So, going back to Gemini and paste this
1:00:51
prompt, create FAQ schema for a page about Gemini 2.5CO with five common
1:00:56
questions and concise answers. output as JSON LD code ready to paste into my
1:01:02
website head section. Copy the code, paste it into the head section of your website, and you're done. Now, when
1:01:09
someone searches for one of those questions, your content shows up. This is super powerful, and almost nobody's
1:01:14
doing it yet. Okay, now here's the advanced move. Gemini 2.5 has this new thing called computer use. It can
1:01:20
actually browse websites like a person. It can click buttons, type into forms, take screenshots, and that means it can
1:01:27
see your page the way a real user would, not just the code. So, here's what you do. Go to Gemini and paste this prompt.
1:01:33
Load this URL and then paste your page URL. Take full page screenshots and then
1:01:38
list the five text blocks you think an AI overview would extract. return the headline, a 40 to 60word summary for
1:01:46
each block. List any missing schema or accessibility issues you detect, and suggest exact concise rewrites, one
1:01:53
sentence each for the three blocks that would make them more AI extractable. Now, hit enter, and Gemini is going to
1:01:58
show you exactly what it sees. It's going to screenshot your page, tell you which parts it would extract, and tell
1:02:04
you what's missing. This is insane because now you can see your page through Gemini's eyes, and you can fix
1:02:09
any issues before you publish. So, if your best content is buried at the bottom, move it to the top. If your
1:02:15
headings are unclear, make them clearer. And if you're missing schema, add it. Because Gemini is looking at your page
1:02:21
visually now. So, if it looks messy or cluttered, Gemini is going to skip it. You want clean, you want clear, you want
1:02:26
structured, and you want your best information right at the top. All right. Now, let's talk about your video because
1:02:31
here's the thing. Gemini doesn't just look at blog posts. It's also pulling from YouTube. So, if you make a video
1:02:38
about the same topic and you do it right, you can show up twice. Once in the AI overview with your blog post and
1:02:44
once in the video results with your YouTube video. That's double the traffic. So, here's the prompt you're
1:02:50
going to use. Go to Gemini and paste this. Write an engaging YouTube script
1:02:56
for an 8-minute video titled rank number one on Gemini 2.5 free SEO trick. Start
1:03:01
with a 12-second hook. Then 30-cond intro who you are plus promise. Then five sections corresponding to the page
1:03:08
outline. Each section 60 to 90 seconds end with 20 second CTA. Include
1:03:13
on-screen text callouts and three suggested B-rolls per section. Tone friendly fast tactical output timestamps
1:03:20
and a short TLDDR for the description. Hit enter and Gemini is going to write your entire script for you with
1:03:25
timestamps with B-roll suggestions with everything. Now, here's the key. Your video needs to match your blog post
1:03:32
structure. same headings, same key points, because when Gemini sees that your video and your blog post are about
1:03:37
the same thing, it knows you're an authority and it's way more likely to rank both. Plus, you want to use
1:03:42
on-screen text for your main points because Gemini can actually read that text in your video. Now, so if you've
1:03:48
got your main keyword in the video title, in the description, and on screen in the video itself, you're way more
1:03:54
likely to get picked. This is massive. All right, here's the thing you need to remember.
1:03:59
Gemini is looking for authority signals. It wants clear author bios. It wants links to credible sources. It wants
1:04:06
schema markup. If you're just copying and pasting generic content, Gemini is not going to trust you. But if you've
1:04:12
got original insights, real examples, and clear structure, you're golden. And here's the other thing. Gemini is
1:04:17
getting smarter every single day. So, the sooner you do this, the better because in 6 months, everyone's going to
1:04:22
be doing this, and it's going to be way harder to stand out. But right now, most people don't even know this exists. So,
1:04:28
you've got a massive head start. Just go do it. And if you're serious about scaling your business fast, book a free

1:05:01
canvas update is insane and it's free. Today, I'm going to show you Google's newest AI feature that literally builds
1:05:08
apps for you. This thing is so crazy, it made working apps in under 2 minutes. I
1:05:13
tested it with two real business ideas, and the results blew my mind. You can build competitor analysis tools, content
1:05:19
generators, and way more without writing a single line of code. This is free right now, and it's about to change everything. So, Google just dropped
1:05:26
something massive. is called Gemini Canvas and it's probably the most insane AI tool I've seen this year. And here's
1:05:32
the crazy part. It's completely free right now. Spent the last few days testing this thing. And I'm not even
1:05:38
joking when I say it. Built me two full working apps in minutes. Not code snippets, not broken demos, full working
1:05:45
apps that you can actually use and share with people. Before I show you exactly what this thing can do, let me ask you
1:05:51
something. How many times have you had a brilliant business idea but couldn't build it because you don't know how to
1:05:56
code? Or maybe you wanted to create some kind of tool for your business, but hiring a developer would cost thousands
1:06:02
of dollars. Well, that problem just got solved. Google Gemini Canvas lets you go from idea to working app faster than it
1:06:08
takes to order coffee. And I'm about to prove it to you with two real tests I did. But first, let me explain what
1:06:13
Canvas actually is. Think of it like having a genius developer sitting right next to you who can build anything you
1:06:19
describe. You just tell it what you want and it creates the entire thing. Not just the code, but a fully functional
1:06:25
app that you can use immediately. Here's what makes this different from every other AI coding tool out there. Most AI
1:06:31
tools give you code that you then have to figure out how to run. Canvas gives you the actual working app. You can
1:06:36
click buttons, type in forms, see results, and even share it with other people instantly. Google says you can
1:06:43
build apps, games, infographics, interactive quizzes, dashboards, and basically anything you can think of, but
1:06:50
I wanted to test it with real business use cases that could actually make money. So, I gave it two challenges that
1:06:55
would normally take weeks to build and cost thousands in development fees. Test number one was simple but powerful. I
1:07:02
asked it to make me an app that scrapes competitor websites, finds their top ranking pages, and creates a content gap
1:07:08
analysis with blog ideas, FAQ sections, and keywords clusters. Basically, a
1:07:13
competitor research tool that would normally cost hundreds per month. I literally just type this into Canvas,
1:07:19
make me an app powered by Gemini, which scrapes competitor websites, identifies their top ranking pages, and
1:07:26
automatically generates a content gap analysis with blog ideas, FAQ sections,
1:07:31
and keyword clusters that should be shown to the user in a simple report. What happened next blew my mind. In less
1:07:39
than two minutes, Canvas built me a complete competitor content analyzer. It had a clean interface where you just
1:07:45
paste a competitor's URL, hit analyze, and boom. The app scrapes their site,
1:07:50
finds what they rank for, and gives you a detailed report with content gaps you can exploit. The interface looked
1:07:56
professional. It had a nice blue color scheme, proper spacing, clear instructions, and a big analyze button.
1:08:03
This thing looked like it came from a real software company, not some AI experiment. But here's where it gets
1:08:08
even crazier. After I built the first app, I noticed this little feature in the bottom right corner called add
1:08:14
Gemini features. So, I clicked it and told Canvas I wanted to enhance my competitor analyzer with new interactive
1:08:21
features. Within minutes, it added two powerful new buttons to my existing app. A generate outline button that creates
1:08:26
detailed blog post outlines for each topic suggestion and a generate ad copy button that writes compelling Google Ads
1:08:33
headlines and descriptions for each keyword cluster. This is the kind of tool that marketing agencies charge
1:08:39
clients hundreds per month to access. And I built it in 2 minutes by typing one sentence. But I wasn't done testing.
1:08:45
I wanted to see if Canvas could handle something even more complex. Test number two was building a content generation
1:08:52
tool. I asked it to create an app that takes a product website as input, analyzes the content, finds high
1:08:58
potential keywords, and generates pillar content plus product blog posts ready to publish. Again, I just described what I
1:09:05
wanted. Make me an app powered by Gemini, which takes as input a website of a product, analyzes the content,
1:09:12
identifies high potential keywords, and then generates pillar content plus product blog posts that should be
1:09:18
displayed to the user as ready to publish drafts. Canvas went to work and built me what it called the AI content
1:09:25
and SEO generator. This app was even more impressive than the first one. It had a clean design with a shield icon,
1:09:32
professional typography, and a simple workflow where you paste your product page content and hit analyze. But here's
1:09:38
what really got me excited. This app didn't just find keywords. It generated three different types of content.
1:09:44
SEOfriendly meta descriptions, social media posts for LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook, and FAQ sections that would
1:09:51
help with user engagement and SEO. This is literally a content marketing agency in an app. the kind of tool that would
1:09:58
normally require a team of developers, content writers, and SEO experts to create. And Canvas built it from scratch
1:10:04
in minutes. And here's the coolest part about Canvas that most people are going to miss. Once you build an app, you can
1:10:11
keep improving it using the add Gemini features button. I tested this by asking Canvas to enhance my content generator
1:10:18
with even more capabilities. I told it to add metadescription generation, social post creation, and FAQ generation
1:10:25
features. Canvas instantly understood what I wanted and seamlessly integrated these new features into my existing app.
1:10:33
It didn't rebuild everything from scratch. It just added the new functionality exactly where it made
1:10:38
sense. Now, you might be thinking, "This sounds too good to be true." Let me show you exactly how this works and how you
1:10:44
can start building your own apps today. First, you go to Gemini and look for the canvas option. It's right there in the
1:10:50
interface. You click canvas and then you just describe what you want to build. The key is being specific about what the
1:10:56
app should do and what results you want. Canvas uses Google's most powerful AI
1:11:01
model called Gemini 2.5 Pro. This thing has a massive context window, which means it can understand complex
1:11:08
instructions and build sophisticated apps that actually work. But here's something most people don't know. Canvas
1:11:14
isn't just for building apps. You can also use it to create interactive quizzes, games, infographics,
1:11:21
dashboards, and even 3D worlds. Google showed examples of people building memory games, music synthesizers, and
1:11:28
algorithm visualizers. The possibilities are endless. You could build customer management systems, sales pipeline
1:11:34
trackers, price calculators, lead generators, survey tools, data analyzers, and basically any business
1:11:39
tool you can think of. And here's the part that really excites me as a business owner. Every app you build with
1:11:45
Canvas is instantly sharable. You get a link that you can send to clients, team
1:11:51
members, or customers. No hosting fees, no technical setup, nothing. It just works. Think about what this means for
1:11:56
your business. You could build custom tools for your clients and charge premium prices. You could create lead
1:12:02
magnets that capture emails. You could build internal tools that save your team hours every week. I've been in the SEO
1:12:08
and digital marketing space for over a decade, and I've never seen anything like this. The barrier to building
1:12:14
software just disappeared overnight. Now, I know what some of you are thinking. Julian, this sounds amazing,
1:12:19
but is it actually reliable? Can you trust these apps for real business use? Here's what I found after testing Canvas
1:12:25
extensively. The apps it builds are surprisingly robust. They handle edge cases well, have clean user interfaces,
1:12:32
and actually deliver on what they promise. Obviously, you're not going to build the next Facebook with this, but for business tools and marketing
1:12:38
applications, it's incredibly powerful. Plus, Canvas has this amazing feature
1:12:43
where you can iterate and improve your apps. If you want to add features or change the design, you just tell it what
1:12:49
to modify and it updates the entire app instantly. Let me give you some specific examples of apps you could build for
1:12:55
your business. Right now, if you're in marketing, you could build competitor analysis tools, keyword research apps,
1:13:02
content idea generators, or ROI calculators. If you're in sales, you could create lead qualification forms,
1:13:08
proposal generators, or customer onboarding tools. If you run an agency, you could build custom reporting
1:13:13
dashboards, client communication portals, or project management tools. The possibilities are literally endless, and each app would normally cost
1:13:20
thousands to develop. But here's what really gets me excited about Canvas. It's democratizing software development.
1:13:26
You no longer need to be a programmer to build powerful tools. You just need good business ideas and the ability to
1:13:32
describe what you want. This is going to create so many opportunities for entrepreneurs and small business owners.
1:13:38
You can now compete with big software companies by building custom solutions for specific niches. And if you're
1:13:44
already in the AI space like many of my subscribers, Canvas gives you a massive competitive advantage. You can build AI
1:13:51
powered tools for your clients faster than anyone else in the market. Now, let me share some pro tips I discovered
1:13:56
while testing Canvas. First, be very specific in your prompts. Instead of saying, "Build me a marketing tool," say
1:14:02
exactly what the tool should do, what inputs it needs, and what outputs you want. Second, think about your user
1:14:08
experience. Canvas builds functional apps, but you want to make sure they're easy for your target audience to use.
1:14:13
Describe the workflow step by step. Third, test your apps thoroughly before sharing them. While Canvas is incredibly
1:14:20
good, you want to make sure everything works as expected for your specific use case. And here's a bonus tip that most
1:14:25
people miss. You can use the add Gemini features button to enhance apps you've already built. If you have an existing
1:14:31
tool that needs new features, just describe what you want to add and Canvas will integrate it seamlessly into your
1:14:38
current app without breaking anything. Before I wrap up, let me address the elephant in the room. Is Canvas actually
1:14:44
free? Yes, it's completely free right now for all Gemini users. Google does offer paid plans that give you access to
1:14:51
more advanced features and higher usage limits, but the free tier is incredibly generous. I've built dozens of apps with
1:14:58
the free version and never hit any limits. This is probably the best free AI tool available anywhere right now.
1:15:04
So, what does this mean for the future? I think we're looking at a fundamental shift in how software gets built.
1:15:10
Instead of hiring developers or learning to code, businesses will just describe what they need and AI will build it.
1:15:16
This creates massive opportunities for people who understand business problems and can communicate them clearly to AI.
1:15:22
If you can identify what tools your market needs and describe them well, you can build an entire software portfolio
1:15:27
without writing code. But here's the thing that really excites me. This is just the beginning. Canvas is already
1:15:33
incredibly powerful, but Google is constantly improving it. 6 months from now, this thing is going to be even more
1:15:38
capable. The businesses that start experimenting with Canvas today are going to have a huge advantage over
1:15:44
their competitors. While everyone else is trying to figure out AI, you'll already be building and deploying custom
1:15:49
tools. If you want to take your AI knowledge to the next level and learn how to scale your business with automation, you need to check out my AI

1:16:08
some of you are probably thinking, "This is great, Julian, but I need more than just AI tools. I need a complete
1:16:14
strategy for growing my business online." And that's exactly why I offer free SEO strategy sessions. These aren't
1:16:20

1:17:35
Canvas, and build your first app today. Start with something simple that would help your business or solve a problem
1:17:40
you're facing. The best part about Canvas is that there's no risk. It's free to use and you can experiment as
1:17:46
much as you want. The worst thing that happens is you learn something new. The best thing that happens is you build a tool that transforms your business. I
1:17:53
genuinely believe that Canvas is going to change how we think about building software. The entrepreneurs who embrace this technology now are going to have
1:18:00
massive advantages over those who wait. The future belongs to people who can identify problems and communicate
1:18:05
solutions clearly to AI. If you can do that, you can build almost anything you can imagine. So, go build something
1:18:11
amazing with Canvas and let me know how it goes in the comments. I read every single one and I'm excited to see what
1:18:16
you create. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one. Today, I'm going to show you a brand new Google AI
1:18:22
agent that can create avatar images and videos in one click. This thing is absolutely crazy. I built this myself
1:18:29
and I'm giving you the full workflow for free. You can automate ads, create viral content, and even make production level
1:18:35
videos without hiring models or photographers. This is going to save you thousands of dollars. So, check this
1:18:41
out. I created this avatar image of me with some crispy chips. But here's where it gets crazy. I can turn this into a
1:18:47
full video, too. Watch this. I can't believe I found Open AI crispy chips.
1:18:53
They are my absolute favorite. Now, that might look simple, but let me show you what's really happening behind
1:18:59
the scenes. This is using Google's brand new Nano Banana AI model, and I've built a complete automation system that can
1:19:06
take any image and turn it into professional ads in seconds. The best part, you don't need to know how to
1:19:11
code. You don't need expensive software, and you definitely don't need to hire anyone. This whole system runs
1:19:17
automatically. But before I show you exactly how this works, I want you to know that this template is only
1:19:23
available inside the AI profit boardroom. I'll tell you more about that later. For now, let me break down this
1:19:29
insane workflow. Here's what we're dealing with. I have this automation built in N. It takes a form submission,
1:19:36
analyzes whatever image you upload, and then creates a completely new avatar image using Google's latest AI. But it
1:19:42
doesn't stop there. I can also feed that image into another workflow that creates full videos. Let me show you a real
1:19:48
example. I uploaded this thumbnail image of myself. The system analyzed it, created a prompt, and generated this
1:19:55
avatar of me eating crisps. The whole thing took less than 2 minutes. Now, here's where most people mess up. They
1:20:01
try to create these systems manually. They spend hours in Photoshop or hiring designers. But with this automation, you
1:20:08
literally just upload an image, type what you want, and boom, professional avatar created. The system works in
1:20:14
steps. First, it uploads your image to Google Drive. Then, it uses Chat GBT to
1:20:20
analyze what's in the image. Next, it creates a detail prompt for the AI image generator. Finally, it sends that prompt
1:20:27
to Google's Nano Banana through Open Rotor and generates your new avatar. But wait, there's more. And this is where it
1:20:33
gets really good. You can take that generated image and run it through my video creation workflow. Okay, this
1:20:41
creates full talking head videos that look completely real. Let me show you another example. I generated this alien
1:20:47
character eating chips. Then I fed it into the video workflow with the prompt
1:20:52
alien talking about his life on his spaceship. Here's what came out. Another day, another, you know, Earthlings and their selfies. Quite the
1:20:59
odd ritual, don't you think? Still, there's a certain charm to their quirks. That's not a real alien, obviously, but
1:21:06
the AI made it look totally believable. The mouth movements sync up perfectly. The expressions look natural. This is
1:21:12
production level quality without a production budget. Now, if you want to get serious about scaling your business
1:21:18
with AI, you need to join the SEO Elite Circle. We have over 1,000 members
1:21:23
sharing the latest strategies for getting more traffic and leads. The link is in the description, but let me keep
1:21:29
showing you this insane workflow. The video generation part uses multiple AI agents working together. First, there's
1:21:35
a brand strategy agent that analyzes your image and brief. then a creative director agent that comes up with the
1:21:41
script concept. Finally, a production specialist that writes the actual script and generates the video. All of this
1:21:46
happens automatically. You just upload an image, write a brief description and wait about 2 minutes. The system handles
1:21:52
everything else. Here's what makes this different from other AI video tools.
1:21:57
Most tools create random characters every time, but because we start with the same base image, we get character
1:22:03
consistency. So, if you want to create a series of ads with the same person, they'll look identical every time. Let
1:22:09
me show you the difference between UGC style and traditional ad style. UC means user generated content. Is that vlog
1:22:16
style where someone's talking directly to camera like they're recording on their phone? Traditional ads look more
1:22:21
polished and professional. The beauty of this system is you can do both. For UGC
1:22:27
style, the AI creates content that looks authentic and conversational. For traditional ads, it creates that
1:22:34
polished, professional look. You just change the prompt and mood settings. Here's a UGC example I generated. That's
1:22:40
UGC style. Now, here's the same product, but traditional ad style. The lighting is professional. The camera angle is
1:22:46
perfect. It looks like a commercial you'd see on TV. But both were generated by AI in under 2 minutes. The real power
1:22:53
comes from automation. Once you set this up, you can create unlimited variations.
1:22:58
Different ages, different genders, different ethnicities. You can test which avatars convert best for your
1:23:04
audience. Think about the money this saves. A professional photo shoot costs thousands. Hiring models, photographers,
1:23:10
editors, then if you want changes, you pay again. With this system, you create as many variations as you want for
1:23:16
basically free. But here's the thing, most people don't tell you about AI APIs. Sometimes they break. Nano Banana
1:23:23
might go down. The video generation might time out. That's just reality with cuttingedge tech. If something doesn't
1:23:29
work, just run it again. Usually, it works the second time. So, I've tested this with all kinds of products,
1:23:34
skincare, watches, food, electronics. It works for everything. You just need to adjust your prompts based on what you're
1:23:40
selling. For example, if I'm selling a watch, I might upload an image of a professional looking guy. Then, my brief
1:23:46
would be man advertising premium watch brand. Cool, sophisticated. The AI
1:23:51
generates content that matches that vibe. The system is flexible, too. You can change the mood settings. Want
1:23:57
something energetic? Set the mood to adrenaline. Want something calm? Use peaceful or relaxed. The AI adjusts the
1:24:03
script and delivery to match. Now, let me address the elephant in the room. Is this ethical? Look, AI avatars are
1:24:09
everywhere now. Movie studios use them. Marketing agencies use them. The key is being transparent. Don't try to trick
1:24:16
people into thinking these are real humans. Use them as creative tools. The applications are endless. e-commerce
1:24:23
product demos, social media content, YouTube ads, sales videos, training materials, anywhere you need human
1:24:29
faces, but don't want the cost and hassle of real actors. Here's something cool. Because this runs through N8N, you
1:24:35
can connect it to other tools, automatically post to social media, send to your email list, upload to YouTube,
1:24:41
create complete marketing campaigns that run themselves. I've been using variations of this system for my agency.
1:24:46
We create personalized video ads for clients. Instead of one generic ad, we can create 50 different versions,
1:24:52
testing different avatars, scripts, and styles. Then we see which ones perform best. The data doesn't lie. Personalized
1:24:58
video content gets 5x more engagement than static images. And AI avatars get almost the same engagement as real
1:25:05
humans, but they cost 99% less to produce. Now, I know what you're thinking, Julian, this sounds
1:25:12
complicated, but it's really not. The hardest part is the initial setup. Once
1:25:18
it's running, you just upload images and get results. That's why I'm giving away the complete templates, all the
1:25:24
automations, all the prompts, all the settings. Normally, this would cost thousands to develop, but I want to help
1:25:30
you get ahead of the curve. The AI landscape changes fast. What's cutting edge today is basic tomorrow, but right
1:25:36
now, most businesses aren't using anything like this, so you have a huge advantage if you start now. Let me show
1:25:42
you one more example. This is a stormtrooper playing banjo. completely random, but it shows the creative
1:25:47
possibilities. You're not limited to ads. You can create viral content, entertainment, educational videos,
1:25:53
whatever gets your audience's attention. The key is testing. Create multiple versions, try different avatars, test
1:26:00
different scripts, see what resonates with your audience. The cost is so low, you can afford to experiment. But
1:26:05
remember, success with AI isn't just about the tools. It's about strategy, understanding your audience, knowing
1:26:10
what messages convert. That's where community comes in. Inside the AI profit boardroom, we have weekly coaching
1:26:16
calls, real business owners sharing what's working. No theory, no fluff, just proven strategies you can implement
1:26:21
immediately. We also have courses on everything from n automation to AI SEO,
1:26:27
plus direct access to me when you need help. It's the fastest way to go from beginner to expert. Here's what I see
1:26:33
happening. Businesses that adopt AI early are going to dominate. Those that wait will get left behind. It's already
1:26:39
happening in every industry. Your competitors might be spending thousands on video production. You can create
1:26:45
better content for dollars. They're hiring teams of designers. You can automate the whole process. But there's
1:26:50
a learning curve, APIs to understand, workflows to build, prompts to optimize. That's where having templates and
1:26:56
community support makes all the difference. I've already done the heavy lifting, tested the workflows, optimized
1:27:01
the prompts, found the best APIs. You get to skip months of trial and error. The technology keeps improving, too.
1:27:07
Nano Banana just launched and it's already better than previous models. Video quality is getting more realistic.
1:27:13
Processing times are getting faster. Costs are going down. This isn't just a cool tool. It's a business advantage.
1:27:18
Faster content creation, lower costs, more testing opportunities, better results. That's the recipe for growth.
1:27:24
Now, let me be clear about something. This isn't magic. You still need good strategy. You still need to understand
1:27:30
your market. But this amplifies everything. It lets you execute ideas faster and cheaper than ever before. The
1:27:36
businesses winning with AI aren't just using one tool. They're building complete systems. Content creation
1:27:41
connects to distribution, connects to analytics, connects to optimization. Everything works together. That's what I
1:27:48
teach inside the AI profit boardroom. Not just individual tools, but complete business systems. How to think
1:27:54
strategically about AI implementation, how to measure results, how to scale what works. We're living through the
1:28:00
biggest business revolution since the internet. Companies that figured out online marketing early dominated their
1:28:06
industries. The same thing is happening with AI right now. Everything you need is right here. Your competitors are
1:28:11
probably watching YouTube videos about AI, but not actually implementing anything. While they're learning theory,
1:28:17
you can be building real systems that generate real results. The choice is yours. Stay where you are and hope
1:28:24
things work out or invest in your future and start building the business you actually want. If you choose to invest,
1:28:30
I promise you won't regret it. The AI profit boardroom isn't just about templates and tools. It's about thinking
1:28:35
differently, seeing opportunities others miss, building systems that compound over time. That's how you go from
1:28:41
working in your business to working on your business. That's how you scale without burning out. That's how you build something that lasts. The link is
1:28:47
in the description. The community is waiting. Your future self will thank you for taking action today. But maybe you're not ready for the full commitment
1:28:54
yet. That's okay, too. If you want to start smaller, book a free SEO strategy session. The link is in the comments and
1:29:00
description. On that call, we'll look at your current situation. Identify the biggest opportunities for
1:29:06
growth. Show you exactly how to implement what we discussed today. No pressure, just value. Whether you join
1:29:12
the community or just book a call, take some kind of action. Don't let this be another video you watch and forget. Your
1:29:17
business deserves better than that. The future belongs to those who embrace change, who see technology as
1:29:23
opportunity, not threat, who take action instead of waiting for perfect conditions. This avatar generation
1:29:29
system could be the first step in completely transforming how you create content, how you serve customers, how
1:29:34
you grow your business, or it could just be another cool thing you learned about but never implemented. The difference is
1:29:40
what you do in the next 24 hours. I've shown you what's possible. I've given you the tools. I've created the support
1:29:45
system. Everything else is up to you. Thanks for watching. Don't forget to subscribe for more AI business strategies. And remember, Julian reads
1:29:52
every comment. So, let me know what you thought about this workflow. I'll see you in the next video. Or better yet, I'll see you inside the AI profit
1:29:58
boardroom where we can really dive deep into building your AI powered business. Talk soon. New Google Gemini canvas is
1:30:05
insane. Today, I'm going to show you Google's secret weapon that's changing everything. This tool is so powerful,
1:30:12
it's scary. You can build apps without coding, create websites in seconds, and it's completely free. Most people don't
1:30:18
even know it exists. Google just dropped something huge and nobody's talking about it. While everyone's fighting over
1:30:24
chat GPT, Google quietly released the most powerful AI builder I've ever seen. It's called Gemini Canvas, and it's
1:30:31
about to change how you build everything online. Here's what blew my mind. I typed one sentence, just one, and it
1:30:37
built me a complete photography website with working galleries, contact forms, everything in under 30 seconds. But
1:30:43
that's just the beginning. What if I told you this same tool can build games, apps, entire businesses, all with simple
1:30:49
English commands? No code needed, no tech skills required, just plain words. You spent the last week testing this,
1:30:56
building everything I could think of. The results shocked me. This isn't just another AI tool. This is the future of
1:31:02
building online, and I'm going to show you exactly how it works. But first, let me tell you what most people are
1:31:08
missing. Google has been rolling out AI tools for months quietly. While everyone watches OpenAI and Anthropic, Google's
1:31:15
been building something bigger, more powerful, and they're giving it away for free. Last month I covered there our AI
1:31:21
studio. That tool alone was incredible. But Gemini canvas makes it look basic. This new update changes everything. You
1:31:27
can now visually edit any part of your creation. Just point andclick then describe what you want changed. The AI
1:31:33
does the rest. Think about what this means. You don't need to hire developers anymore. You don't need to learn code.
1:31:38
You don't need expensive software. Just your ideas and plain English. That's it. But here's where it gets crazy. The tool
1:31:44
doesn't just build static websites. It creates interactive experiences. games that actually work, apps with real
1:31:51
functionality, and it's all powered by Google's most advanced AI models. I'm talking about Gemini 2.5 Pro, the same
1:31:57
model that costs hundreds of dollars elsewhere. Google's giving you access for free. No limits, no restrictions,
1:32:03
just pure AI power at your fingertips. Let me show you what happened when I tested it. I asked for a photography
1:32:09
portfolio, something professional looking, the kind that usually costs thousands to build. Within seconds, I
1:32:14
had a complete website. But not just any website. One with AI generated images, working filters, an about page, contact
1:32:20
forms, everything. But wait, there's more. And this is where your jaw will drop. The AI didn't just build a
1:32:26
website. It added smart features. Features I didn't even ask for, like an AI biogenerator and an art director
1:32:32
feedback system. The AI literally made my website smarter than I imagined. How
1:32:37
is this possible? Google's been training their AI on millions of websites, apps,
1:32:42
games, everything online. So when you ask for something, it doesn't just copy templates. It understands what makes
1:32:48
things work, what users want, what converts visitors into customers. But the real magic happens with the new
1:32:55
select and ask feature. This is gamechanging. You can click on any part of your creation, then tell the AI what
1:33:01
to change in plain English. No technical language needed. Want that button bigger? Click and ask. Want different
1:33:08
colors? Click and ask. Want to completely redesign a section? Click and ask. The AI understands and makes it
1:33:15
happen instantly. Tested this on everything, websites, games, apps, every
1:33:20
time. The results amaze me. But one test blew my mind completely. I asked it to build a Minecraft clone, a working game.
1:33:27
With blocks, you can break and place, jump in, everything. Most developers would need weeks to build this. Teams of
1:33:34
programmers, thousands of lines of code. I got it in one prompt, one sentence, and it worked perfectly. You could
1:33:40
actually play it. This isn't just impressive. is revolutionary. We're looking at the end of traditional
1:33:45
development. Why spend months learning code when you can describe what you want in seconds? But here's what excites me
1:33:51
most. This is just the beginning. Google's rolling out updates constantly new features every week, more AI models,
1:33:58
more power, more possibilities, and they're doing it all for free. While other companies charge hundreds or
1:34:03
thousands, Google's betting on volume. They want everyone using their AI. And
1:34:08
honestly, it's working. But there's a catch, and you need to know this. The tool has rate limits. Use it too much
1:34:15
and you'll hit a wall. But Google thought of that, too. They have backup tools, alternative access points, ways
1:34:21
to keep building even when one tool maxes out. The smart move. Use multiple Google AI tools. Switch between them.
1:34:28
Maximize your building time. I'll show you exactly how to do this later. Let me tell you about something else that's huge. The AI doesn't just build what you
1:34:35
ask for. It makes suggestions, improvements, additions you didn't think of. is like having a team of expert
1:34:40
developers giving you advice. When I built that photography site, the AI added features I never mentioned. A
1:34:47
gallery filter system, smooth animations, professional typography. It understood what a photography portfolio
1:34:53
needed without me explaining it. This level of intelligence is scary good. The AI doesn't just follow commands. It
1:35:00
anticipates needs. It thinks ahead. It builds better than most humans could. But here's where most people mess up.
1:35:06
They think this tool is just for developers or tech people. Wrong. This is for everyone. Business owners,
1:35:12
marketers, students, anyone with ideas. You run a restaurant, build an ordering app, you're a coach, create a booking
1:35:18
system, you sell products, build an e-commerce site, all without touching code, all for free. The applications are
1:35:23
endless. And that's what makes this so powerful. You're not limited by technical skills anymore, just by your imagination. Let me share something that
1:35:30
will shock you. I built five different apps in one afternoon. a portfolio site, a game, a business calculator, a booking
1:35:37
system, and a social media scheduler. Each one took minutes, not hours, not days, minutes. Try doing that with
1:35:43
traditional development. You'd need months, multiple developers, thousands of dollars. With Gemini Canvas is just
1:35:49
natural language and creativity. But the tool keeps getting better. Every update brings new features, new possibilities,
1:35:55
new ways to build faster and smarter. The latest update added visual editing. Before you had to describe everything in
1:36:02
text. Now you can point and click, select elements, make changes visually. It's like having Photoshop for web
1:36:07
development. And the AI understands context. If you're editing a button, it knows you might want to change colors,
1:36:13
sizes, or text. It offers relevant suggestions. Makes the process even faster. But here's something most people
1:36:19
don't realize. This tool isn't just about building. It's about learning. Every time you use it, you see how
1:36:25
things work, how websites are structured, how apps function. You're getting a free education in development.
1:36:30
I've learned more about web development in the past month than in years of tutorials because I'm actually building,
1:36:36
actually creating, actually seeing results. And that's the key difference. This isn't just another AI chatbot. It's
1:36:42
a creation engine, a building machine, a way to turn ideas into reality instantly. But let me warn you about
1:36:48
something. This tool is addictive. Once you start building, you won't want to stop. I've been up until 3:00 a.m. just
1:36:54
experimenting, creating random apps and websites just to see what's possible. The freedom is intoxicating. No
1:37:01
limitations, no barriers, just pure creative power. And it's all free. Speaking of free, let me tell you why
1:37:06
Google's doing this. They're not being generous. They're being strategic. Every app you build potentially uses their
1:37:12
services, their ads, their analytics, their cloud storage. They make money on the back end while giving you the tools
1:37:18
for free. Smart business model. And honestly, I don't care. If Google wants to give me powerful AI tools for free,
1:37:24
I'll take it. And you should, too. But here's what you need to do right now. Don't wait. Don't hesitate. This technology is moving fast. Companies
1:37:31
that adopt it early will dominate. Those that wait will be left behind. Start small. Build a simple website. Test the
1:37:37
features. Get comfortable with the interface. Then think bigger. What could you create for your business, your
1:37:43
clients, your ideas, the learning curve is almost zero. If you can describe what you want, you can build it. That's the
1:37:50
beauty of natural language AI. No technical barriers, no complex syntax, just normal conversation. And the
1:37:56
results speak for themselves. professional looking creations in minutes. Features that would take weeks
1:38:01
to code, all generated from simple descriptions. But remember what I said about rate limits. Use the tool smart.
1:38:08
Don't waste prompts on tiny changes. Plan your builds. Know what you want before you start. Maximize every
1:38:14
interaction. Also, save your work constantly. Download your creations. Back them up. The tool is free, but your
1:38:20
work is valuable. Protect it. Here's another tip. Don't just build randomly. Think strategically. What does your
1:38:26
business need? What problems can you solve? How can you use this tool to make money or save time? I've already started
1:38:32
building client tools, custom calculators, lead magnets, portfolio sites, things that used to cost
1:38:38
thousands now take minutes. That's pure profit, and the quality is getting better constantly. Google's AI models
1:38:44
improve weekly. What's good today will be incredible tomorrow. We're riding the wave of exponential improvement. But the
1:38:51
real opportunity isn't just in building. It's in understanding what's possible. This tool shows us the future where AI
1:38:58
can take us. What becomes achievable when barriers disappear. Think about the implications. If anyone can build
1:39:04
professional apps and websites, what happens to the industry? What new opportunities emerge? What old business
1:39:10
models become obsolete? We're living through a revolution. And most people don't even know it's happening. While
1:39:16
they debate AI safety and regulations, the tools are already here, already changing everything. The question isn't
1:39:22
whether AI will replace developers. is whether you'll use AI to build before everyone else catches on. And that's
1:39:28
exactly what you should do. Get ahead of the curve. Start building today. Learn the tools. Understand the possibilities.
1:39:35
Position yourself for what's coming. Because this is just version one. Imagine what version 10 will look like.
1:39:40
The power will be unimaginable. The possibilities endless, but only for those who start now. Here's what I want
1:39:46
you to do right after this video. Go try Gemini Canvas. Don't overthink it. Don't plan for hours. Just start building. See
1:39:53
what happens. Feel the power for yourself. Build something simple first. A personal website, a landing page,
1:39:58
something you can complete quickly. Get that first win. Feel the excitement of creating without barriers. Then think
1:40:04
bigger. What's always seemed impossible? What ideas have you shelved because they were too technical, too expensive, too
1:40:11
complex? Dust them off. Try them out. The worst that happens is you learn something new. The best case, you build
1:40:17
something amazing that changes your business or life. And don't worry about making it perfect. That's the beauty of
1:40:22
this tool. You can iterate instantly, make changes in seconds, try different
1:40:27
approaches. Perfect is the enemy of done. Also, experiment with the new features. The select and ask function is
1:40:35
incredibly powerful. The AI feature additions can surprise you. Play with everything. Push the boundaries.
1:40:41
Document what you build. Take screenshots. Save your prompts. You'll want to remember what worked, what
1:40:46
didn't, how to improve next time, and share your creations. The AI community is incredibly supportive. People love
1:40:53
seeing what others build. You might inspire someone else or get inspired yourself. But most importantly, think
1:40:59
about scale. This tool doesn't just build one thing. It builds everything. Systems, workflows, entire digital
1:41:06
ecosystems. The limitation is your imagination. I'm already planning bigger projects, multi-app systems, integrated
1:41:12
solutions, things that seemed impossible weeks ago. Now they're just prompts away. And that's the mindset shift you
1:41:18
need from can this be built to how do I describe what I want. That's the new
1:41:23
skill. Clear communication with AI. Practice this. Get good at describing
1:41:30
your vision. The clearer your prompt, the better your result. Think like
1:41:36
you're talking to a very smart but literal assistant. Be specific about functionality, colors, layout, user
1:41:41
experience. The more details you provide, the closer you get to your vision. but also leave room for AI
1:41:47
creativity. Sometimes the best features are ones you didn't think of. Let the AI surprise you. Julian Goldie reads every

it. Don't let this opportunity pass by. Start building today. New Google Gemini AI updates are insane. Google AI just
1:42:52
posted on X saying they had a busy week. They just dropped five gamechanging updates. We're talking about Olympic
1:42:59
level AI performance, sharable custom assistance, free video generation with sound on YouTube, AI built right into
1:43:06
your browser for US users, and autonomous payment systems. Update one. Gemini 2.5 Deepthink goes Olympic.
1:43:13
Gemini 2.5 Deepthink just achieved gold medal level performance at the 2025 ICPC
1:43:20
World Finals. This is literally the Olympics of programming where the smartest computer science students
1:43:26
compete. Gemini solved 10 out of 12 incredibly complex programming problems in just 5 hours. But here's the crazy
1:43:33
part. It solved problem C in under 30 minutes, which literally no human team could solve. Not one of the 139
1:43:40
university teams from around the world cracked this problem, but Gemini figured it out and you now have access to an AI
1:43:47
that can solve problems. And this isn't just about coding. When an AI can think at this level, it can tackle complex
1:43:53
problems in any field. Update two, you can now share your Gemini app gems with anyone just like sharing a Google Drive
1:44:00
file. You can set permissions, share with specific emails, or create sharable links. is a complete enterprise level
1:44:07
sharing system. Before this, custom gems were locked to your account. Now you can create custom AI assistants and
1:44:14
distribute them to your entire team. Update three, V3 fast transforms
1:44:19
YouTube. At Google's made on YouTube event, they announced V3 Fast coming to
1:44:24
YouTube shorts for completely free. You can create short video clips with sound effects and speech using just a single
1:44:32
text prompt. This is the first time AI generated videos include highquality sound. But it gets crazier. You can now
1:44:38
animate people in your photos. Take a still photo and bring it to life with AI animation. Edit with AI transforms your
1:44:45
camera roll into a first draft video. Analyzing footage and pairing it with music and effects. Soon creators can
1:44:51
turn spoken words into music with speech to song. Take any quote from a video and use Google's LIA 2 model to remix it
1:44:58
into a catchy song for shorts. You could type a description of the perfect promotional video and have it generated
1:45:04
with sound. Take product photos and animate them. Turn customer testimonials into jingles. All free on YouTube
1:45:11
shorts. Julian Goldie reads every comment. So, make sure you comment below
1:45:16
and let me know which of these updates excites you the most. Before we dive deeper, I want to tell you about
1:45:21
something that's going to help you take advantage of all these new AI capabilities. I've created the AI profit
1:45:28
boardroom, which is the best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with AI
1:45:34
automation. We currently have over 1,000 members who are already implementing these exact strategies. Update 4, Gemini
1:45:42
in Chrome for everyone. Gemini is now rolling out to all Chrome users in the US for free. Before this, you needed a
1:45:48
paid subscription. Now, it's built right into Chrome for everyone using Mac and Windows. You can highlight any text on
1:45:54
any web page and instantly get analysis or explanations. Reading competitor
1:46:00
websites, get immediate strategic insights, reviewing industry reports, get summaries without reading
1:46:06
everything. The real power is contextual awareness. Gemini understands what web page you're on, what you're reading,
1:46:12
what task you're completing. It works across multiple tabs to provide insights relevant to your current project. Update
1:46:19
5. AI agents can now handle payments. Google announced the agent payments protocol AP2. This allows AI agents to
1:46:27
handle payments and complete transactions autonomously. Over 60 major companies back this including
1:46:34
Mastercard, PayPal, American Express, and Coinbase. You could have an AI agent that finds the best deals and actually
1:46:40
completes purchases. The AI pairs options and executes transactions without human intervention. The system
1:46:47
uses cryptographically signed digital contracts called mandates. An intent mandate captures your request. A cart
1:46:54
mandate provides final approval. For complex scenarios, you can set detailed mandates that let AI auto purchase when
1:47:00
conditions are met. Imagine an AI managing all your software subscriptions, finding better deals automatically, or handling office
1:47:07
supplies, purchasing before you run out, or managing vendor relationships and contract renewals. When you combine
1:47:13
Olympic level thinking with sharable assistance, video creation with sound, browser integration, and autonomous
1:47:20
payments, you get something exponentially more powerful. Your AI can think through complex problems, create
1:47:25
video content with sound, share solutions with your team, and handle financial transactions. This automation
1:47:31
level has never existed before. In the middle of our journey here, I want to mention that we have a complete SOP and
1:47:38
process for implementing all of these AI tools inside the AI money lab. You'll
1:47:44
find the link in the comments and description along with over 100 different use cases that show you
1:47:49
exactly how to profit from these capabilities. If you're in e-commerce, use Deep Think to optimize supply
1:47:55
chains, create gems for product research, generate video ads with sound, and automate vendor payments. If you're
1:48:01
in professional services, handle complex client analysis. Create sharable methodology gems. Produce educational
1:48:08
videos with sound and automate billing. If you're in content creation, use Olympic level thinking for strategy,
1:48:14
sharable gems for brand voice, professional video generation, and automated tool payments. There's always
1:48:20
a window where early adopters gain massive advantages. The businesses that master these tools will operate at a
1:48:26
level that seems magical compared to traditional companies, but this window won't stay open forever. Your competitors will eventually figure this
1:48:32
out. The question is whether you'll be leading the transformation or catching up. Here's what most people don't understand about this Google
1:48:38
announcement. Previous AI updates gave us better chat bots or smarter assistants. These five updates create an
1:48:45
entirely new category of business automation. For the first time ever, you have AI that can think at superhuman
1:48:51
levels, work collaboratively across teams, create professional multimedia content, integrate seamlessly into your
1:48:57
existing workflow, and handle real money transactions. This isn't just about productivity anymore. This is about
1:49:03
fundamentally changing how businesses operate. Think about it. 6 months ago, if you wanted professional video
1:49:09
content, you needed cameras, editing software, maybe a whole production team. Now you can create Hollywood quality
1:49:14
videos with sound using just text. If you wanted expert level problem solving, you needed to hire specialists or
1:49:20
consultants. Now you have AI that outperforms Olympic level programmers. The speed of this transformation is
1:49:27
unprecedented. We're not talking about gradual improvements over years. These capabilities went from impossible to
1:49:33
available in a single week. That's the kind of technological leap that creates new industries and destroys old ones.
1:49:40
Get access to Deep Think and test it on complex challenges. Create custom gems for your business and share them with
1:49:47
your team. Experiment with V3 fast on YouTube shorts. Use Gemini and Chrome if
1:49:52
you're in the US. Prepare for AP2 payment automation. The AI profit boardroom is specifically
1:49:59
designed to help you implement these cutting edge strategies. We have over 1,000 members scaling their businesses
1:50:05
with AI automation. If you want to book a free SEO strategy session to discuss
1:50:10
how these updates can transform your business, you'll find that link in the comments and description. And remember,
1:50:15
we have a complete SOP inside the AI money lab. You'll get over 100 use cases, video tutorials, and access to
1:50:22
19,000 members. You'll see how we provide 100 different tutorials as freebies daily. The reason we have
1:50:28
19,000 members is because people want to learn from others successfully implementing these strategies. These
1:50:34
Google Gemini updates represent the future of business, Olympic level thinking, sharable assistance, video
1:50:40
creation with sound, browser integration, and autonomous payments. Companies that master these tools will
1:50:45
dominate. Those that ignore them will become irrelevant. Comment below and let me know which update you're most excited
1:50:52
to implement. Julian reads every comment and we love hearing your AI success stories. The future is here. These tools
1:50:59
are available now. Your only question should be how quickly you can start using them to transform your business.
1:51:05
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video where we'll dive deeper into implementation strategies for these
1:51:11
revolutionary AI updates. New Gemini in Chrome update is absolutely insane.
1:51:17
Chrome's new AI features just dropped and this is the biggest browser update in history. Google just made Chrome 100
1:51:24
times smarter with AI. This isn't just another update. This is going to change how you browse the web. We're talking
1:51:30
about AI that can think across all your tabs. AI that can book your groceries and AI that can remember every website
1:51:37
you've ever visited. This is crazy stuff and it's rolling out right now. So, Google just announced what they're
1:51:42
calling the biggest upgrade to Chrome in its 16-year history. They've basically turned your browser into an AI assistant
1:51:49
that can think, work, and browse for you. Let me break down exactly what's happening here because this is massive.
1:51:54
First up, they've put Gemini AI directly inside Chrome, not as an extension, not
1:52:00
as a separate app. It's built right into your browser. You click this little sparkle icon in the top right corner,
1:52:06
and you've got an AI assistant that can see and understand everything on your current web page. But here's where it
1:52:12
gets insane. This AI doesn't just look at one tab. It can see all your tabs at once. So, let's say you're planning a
1:52:18
vacation and you have five different tabs open. one for flights, one for hotels, one for restaurants, one for
1:52:23
activities, and one for weather. Instead of jumping between all these tabs and trying to organize everything yourself,
1:52:30
you just ask Gemini to create a complete itinerary for you. It looks at all five tabs, pulls all the information
1:52:36
together, and gives you a perfect travel plan. And wait, there's more. Remember those times when you found something
1:52:41
cool online, but you can't remember where you saw it? Like, you remember seeing this perfect walnut desk last
1:52:47
week, but you have no idea which website it was on? Well, now you can just ask Chrome, "What was that website with the
1:52:53
walnut desk I looked at last week?" And it will find it for you. Your browser now has perfect memory of everything
1:52:59
you've ever looked at. But the craziest part is what's coming soon. Google is adding AI agents that can actually
1:53:06
complete web tasks for you. They specifically mentioned booking a haircut or ordering your weekly groceries. The
1:53:13
AI will handle these tedious tasks while you stay in control and focus on what matters. Now, let me tell you about
1:53:19
something that's going to help you scale your business with AI. If you want to stay ahead of updates like this Chrome
1:53:25
integration and learn how to leverage AI for business growth, check out my AI profit boardroom. We have over 1,000
1:53:32
members who are using AI to get more customers and automate their workflows. Now, here's something that's going to
1:53:39
save you so much time. The address bar, what Google calls the omni box, is get
1:53:44
AI mode. This means instead of typing simple search terms, you can ask complex questions directly in your address bar.
1:53:52
Like instead of searching best mattress, you can type, "I'm a side sleeper with lower back pain. What's the best
1:53:57
mattress for me under $2,000 with good reviews?" And you'll get a detailed AI answer right there without even going to
1:54:04
a search results page. Chrome is also getting contextual awareness. The browser now understands what type of
1:54:09
content you're looking at and can suggest relevant actions. If you're reading a recipe, it might suggest converting measurements or finding
1:54:16
substitutions. If you're looking at a product, it might suggest checking reviews or finding better prices. The
1:54:22
safety features are incredible, too. Chrome is using AI to detect and block sophisticated scams that are getting
1:54:28
harder and harder for humans to spot. These are fake virus alerts and fake giveaways that look super convincing.
1:54:34
The AI can spot patterns that humans miss. The security improvements go beyond just scam detection. Chrome is
1:54:41
getting better at identifying suspicious downloads, warning about unsafe websites before you even click, and automatically
1:54:47
updating security settings based on new threats. Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below
1:54:54
and let me know what you think about these Chrome updates. Are you excited or worried about AI taking over your
1:55:00
browser? But wait, there's more integration coming. Gemini in Chrome connects directly with Google Calendar,
1:55:06
YouTube, Maps, and all your Google apps. So, if you're reading about an event on a web page, you can just ask Gemini to
1:55:12
add it to your calendar without switching tabs. If you're looking for a specific moment in a YouTube video, you
1:55:18
can ask Gemini to find it and take you right there. This rollout is starting with English speakers in the US on Mac
1:55:24
and Windows desktop. The mobile versions are coming soon to both Android and iOS users. And for businesses, there are
1:55:30
enterprise level protections when this rolls out to Google Workspace. Here's why this matters so much. We're not just
1:55:36
talking about a browser update. We're talking about the fundamental shift in how we interact with the internet. Instead of you browsing the web, the web
1:55:43
is basically browsing itself for you. You tell it what you want and AI figures out how to get it done. This is the same
1:55:49
pattern we're seeing everywhere in AI doing the work for you, right? And Chrome is probably the most important
1:55:55
place for this to happen because Chrome has almost 70% of the browser market. This means billions of people are about
1:56:01
to get access to AI browsing assistance. She the competitive timing here is interesting. While other companies are
1:56:08
building separate AI browsers or requiring downloads, Google is upgrading the browser people already use. This
1:56:14
gives them a massive distribution advantage that's hard to compete with. The integration with Google apps looks
1:56:20
really smooth based on what Google has shown. You can be reading about an event on any web page and just ask Gemini to
1:56:27
add it to your calendar without having to copy paste dates or switch to Google calendar. Chrome can now suggest
1:56:33
relevant questions based on the context of the page you're viewing. This helps you get more information without having
1:56:38
to think of what to ask next. Google has built this AI functionality to feel fast and responsive when you interact with it
1:56:45
on web pages. The browsing history search goes beyond simple keyword matching. The AI understands the content
1:56:51
and context of pages you visited. So, you can search by description, topic, or even vague memories of what you were
1:56:57
looking for. But it's like having a perfect memory of everything you've ever seen online. The task automation
1:57:02
capabilities coming soon represent a major shift in how we interact with websites. Instead of learning how each
1:57:08
website works, you just describe what you want to accomplish and the AI figures out the steps. This could
1:57:13
eliminate a lot of the friction that keeps people from doing things online. Google's approach of enhancing existing
1:57:19
websites instead of replacing them is strategically smart. Website owners don't need to change anything to work
1:57:25
with Chrome's AI. This removes barriers to adoption and means the benefits are available immediately across the entire
1:57:31
web. Having this level of AI assistance on mobile devices opens up new possibilities for productivity on the
1:57:37
go. Complex research, comparison shopping, and task completion that used to require sitting at a computer can now
1:57:44
be done effectively from your phone with AI handling the heavy lifting. This could be the tipping point that makes AI
1:57:49
assistance truly mainstream. Unlike voice assistants that require learning new interaction patterns, this AI works
1:57:56
within the browsing experience people already know. The learning curve is minimal, but the productivity gains are
1:58:01
massive. For businesses, having employees with AI powered browsing assistance could significantly boost
1:58:06
productivity while maintaining security controls. Google Workspace integration means companies can deploy this safely
1:58:12
with proper data protection and usage monitoring. The implications for content creators and website owners are
1:58:18
interesting. If AI is reading and interpreting web content for users, optimizing for AI comprehension becomes
1:58:24
as important as traditional SEO, this could reshape how we think about web design and content structure. The
1:58:31
infrastructure required to support AI browsing assistance for billions of users is staggering. Google's existing
1:58:37
cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities give them a unique advantage in delivering this at scale without
1:58:43
performance issues. Making these core AI features free for regular users removes
1:58:48
the biggest barrier to adoption. When advanced AI assistance becomes a standard part of browsing instead of a
1:58:54
premium add-on, it changes user expectations across the entire internet. The global expansion plan shows Google's
1:59:01
confidence in these features. Starting with English and the US market for testing, then rolling out worldwide as
1:59:07
they refine the technology and add language support. Now, if you want to stay ahead of AI updates like this and
1:59:13
learn how to use them to scale your business, make sure you check out my AI profit boardroom. We have over 1,000
1:59:19

2:00:02
This isn't a separate app you need to download. It's not a premium feature locked behind a payw wall. It's built
2:00:08
into the browser that most people already use every day. This is going to change how people interact with the web.
2:00:14
It's going to change how businesses think about their online presence. And it's going to accelerate AI adoption in
2:00:19
a way we haven't seen before. The next few months are going to be really interesting as more people get access to
2:00:24
this and start using AI for everyday browsing tasks. This could be the moment when AI assistants finally become as
2:00:31
normal as using a search engine. Make sure you subscribe and hit the notification bell because I'll be

thoughts on Chrome's AI integration. Are you excited about having I browse the web for you or does it make you nervous?
2:00:48
This is Julian Goldie and I'll see you in the next video. New Google Gemini TV
2:00:53
is insane. Google just launched their Gemini AI right into your TV. This isn't
2:00:59
just voice commands anymore. It's full conversations with your TV. And it gets even wilder than that. Not just an app,
2:01:05
not just a feature. Google's entire AI brain is now built into the TV software.
2:01:10
And this is happening right now. TCL just released the first TVs with Google Gemini built-in, the QM9K series. These
2:01:18
TV can sense when you walk into the room. There's an invisible radar sensor that knows you're there. Walk into your
2:01:23
living room and the TV turns on by itself. Walk away and it shuts off. No remotes, no touching anything. The TV
2:01:31
just knows. But that's just the start. The real magic happens when you start talking to it. And I mean really
2:01:36
talking. Not just saying, "Hey Google, find me a movie." You can have full conversations like this. You walk in and
2:01:42
say, "Hey Google, I want to watch something with my wife. I like action movies, but she likes romance." And
2:01:47
Gemini thinks about both of you and suggest movies that mix both. It's like having a smart friend who knows what
2:01:53
everyone wants to watch. Or let's say you missed the last season of your favorite show. You can literally ask
2:01:58
what happened in season 3 of whatever show and Gemini gives you a full recap. No more scrolling through Wikipedia or
2:02:05
YouTube recaps. Your TV just tells you everything you missed. But here's where it gets really wild. Remember when TV
2:02:12
were just for watching stuff? Those days are over. Now your TV becomes your teacher, your research assistant, your homework helper. Your kid has a science
2:02:19
project about volcanoes. You ask the TV, "Explain why volcanoes erupt to my third grader." Gemini breaks it down in simple
2:02:26
words. Then you follow up with how do I make a model volcano? Step-by-step instructions with YouTube videos right
2:02:32
on your screen. Adults can use this, too. Want to learn guitar? Ask Gemini, "How do I learn guitar as a beginner? It
2:02:39
gives you a learning path, plus shows you videos to get started, all on the biggest screen in your house." If you're
2:02:44
in business or want to scale your income, this technology shift creates massive opportunities. That's why I
2:02:50
created the AI Profit Boardroom. It's the best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of
2:02:56
hours with AI automation. We currently have over 1,000 members who are building businesses around AI technology. Here's
2:03:03
something nobody talks about. Gemini on TV is way faster than the old Google Assistant ever was on TVs. The responses
2:03:10
are optimized for TV use with improved voice recognition and processing. Ask a question and get answers almost
2:03:16
instantly. And the responses are better, too. your Gemini can pull from YouTube
2:03:21
videos, Google search, and all of Google's data. So, when you ask about travel destinations, it shows you videos
2:03:28
of those places. When you ask about cooking, it shows you how-to videos. These new TVs have presence sensing.
2:03:35
That's customizable. You can set exactly how close you need to be before the TV turns on. Don't want it turning on when
2:03:41
you just walk past. Set it to only turn on when you sit on the couch or when you're 3 ft away. You control it all.
2:03:47
Now, here's the business side that nobody's talking about. Google isn't just adding AI to TVs. They're creating
2:03:52
a new platform. Right now, only TCL has this. But Google announced that more TV
2:03:58
makers are coming. Highsense, Sony, and others will have Gemini TV soon. For
2:04:04
content creators, this creates new opportunities and challenges. How do you optimize videos for AI search? How do
2:04:10
you create content that Gemini will recommend? How do you build audiences on AI powered platforms? These are
2:04:15
questions we're answering in the AI Money Lab. That's our comprehensive training program that shows you exactly
2:04:21
how to build income with AI tools and strategies. Inside the lab, you get step-by-step processes for using AI in
2:04:28
business. Over 100 different use cases and tutorials, plus access to our community of 19,000 members who are
2:04:34
already building AI powered businesses. But for users, this creates something incredible. Imagine asking your TV
2:04:41
complex questions and getting real answers like, "What stocks should I invest in today?" or "How do I fix my
2:04:46
leaky foret?" or "What's the best way to train my dog?" Your TV becomes your personal adviser. And because it's
2:04:52
connected to Google's massive data, the answers are usually pretty good. The educational possibilities are insane,
2:04:58
too. Kids can ask homework questions and get explanations with visual examples. Adults can learn new skills with
2:05:04
step-by-step tutorials. Families can explore topics together on the big screen. Want to plan a vacation to
2:05:10
Japan? Ask Gemini about the best places to visit in spring. It shows you videos of cherry blossoms, explains the
2:05:16
weather, suggests activities, and even helps you understand the culture, all while you're relaxing on your couch.
2:05:22
This is already changing how families interact with technology. Instead of everyone staring at their phones,
2:05:27
families are gathering around the TV to explore topics together. Parents and kids asking questions and learning
2:05:33
together. But here's the crazy part. We're still in the early days. Google says this is just the start. More Gemini
2:05:39
capabilities are coming to TV soon, which makes me wonder what else they're planning. But here's what really gets me
2:05:44
excited. The speed of innovation here is incredible. That's how fast AI is moving
2:05:49
into our everyday lives. And the price point tells you something important. Starting at $3,000 for the 65-in model.
2:05:57
That's expensive, but not crazy expensive for a premium TV with this much technology built in. Compare that
2:06:02
to buying a high-end TV plus a smart speaker plus all the other devices you'd need to get similar functionality. The
2:06:09
all-in-one approach actually makes sense. Let me tell you about something that's happening right now in the AI space. Companies are racing to integrate
2:06:15
AI into every device we use. But Google might have the smartest strategy here. The living room TV is the center of most
2:06:22
homes. It's where families gather. It's the biggest screen. It's always plugged in. And now it's the smartest device in
2:06:27
your house. For consumers though, the real benefit is convenience. Instead of pulling out your phone to look something
2:06:33
up, you just ask your TV. Instead of typing search queries, you have conversations. Instead of hunting
2:06:39
through apps and menus, you describe what you want in natural language. It's the difference between using technology
2:06:45
and having technology serve you. And that's a fundamental shift in how we interact with our devices. Here's what's
2:06:51
really fascinating about the timing. Google launched this, right? As people are spending more time at home, remote
2:06:57
work is normal now. Families are watching more content together. Kids are doing more homework in shared spaces.
2:07:02
Gemini TV arrives exactly when we need smarter home technology. It's like
2:07:07
Google timed this perfectly for how people actually live today. And the educational angle is brilliant. Parents
2:07:13
struggle to help kids with homework they don't understand. Teachers need better tools for remote learning. Students need
2:07:19
ways to explore topics beyond textbooks. Gemini TV solves all of these problems. But here's something that concerns me.
2:07:26
Privacy. Gemini TV is always listening for hey Google commands. It has sensors that
2:07:32
track when you're in the room. It knows what you watch, what you ask about, how you use your living room. Google says
2:07:38
the data helps improve the experience. And I'm sure it does, but that's a lot of personal information flowing to
2:07:43
Google's servers. Families need to understand what they're sharing when they bring this technology into their
2:07:48
homes. The good news is Google has privacy controls. You can turn off always listening. You can disable
2:07:55
presence sensing. You can delete your conversation history, but most people won't use these controls because they
2:08:00
make the experience less convenient. That's the trade-off with AI technology. Convenience versus privacy, and everyone
2:08:07
has to decide for themselves where they draw the line. The QM9K TVs I've been talking about are available right now at
2:08:14
Best Buy. The 65-in model starts at $3,000. The 75 in, 85 in, and 98 in
2:08:21
models cost more. We're witnessing the beginning of a new era in home entertainment. TVs that think, learn,
2:08:27
and have conversations. Displays that adapt to your presence and understand your preferences. AI assistants that
2:08:33
live on the biggest screen in your house. The bottom line is this. AI is moving from our phones and computers into our living rooms. It's becoming
2:08:40
part of how families interact, learn, and entertain themselves. And Google just fired the first shot in what's
2:08:46
going to be a massive battle for AI powered home entertainment. Gemini TV is just the beginning, but it's a pretty
2:08:52
incredible beginning. The technology works, the use cases are clear, and the future possibilities are exciting.
2:08:57
Whether you buy one of these TVs now or wait for the next generation, AI powered displays are coming to every home. The
2:09:04
question is how quickly you want to experience the future of home entertainment. If you want help navigating this AI revolution and

2:09:52
part of something bigger than them. Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you share your thoughts about Gemini TV and whether you think AI
2:09:59
powered televisions will change how families use technology. Are you excited about having conversations with your TV
2:10:05
or does this feel like too much AI in our daily lives? Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next update about
2:10:11
the latest AI developments that are changing how we work, learn, and live. Today I'm going to show you Google's new
2:10:17
AI that just broke the internet. This thing can edit your photos better than a pro designer in seconds. 10 million
2:10:24
people joined Gemini in one week because of this. I'm about to blow your mind with what this can do. Get ready because
2:10:30
this changes everything. So, what is this nano banana thing? It's Google's new AI that can edit images like magic.
2:10:36
But not just edit. It can create. It can transform. It can do things that used to take hours in Photoshop in just seconds
2:10:43
with simple words. Here's what blew my mind. This AI brought 10 million new users to Gemini in just one week. 10
2:10:50
million. That's more than most apps get in a year. Why? Because this thing is revolutionary. Let me show you what
2:10:55
makes this so special. First, it can understand multiple images at once. You can give it two photos and tell it to
2:11:02
merge them. Want to put yourself in a photo with your pet? Done. Want to change the background of your room to
2:11:08
see how new wallpaper looks? Easy. Want to place yourself anywhere in the world? No problem. But here's where it gets
2:11:15
crazy. Most AI image tools make you look weird or fake. You know what I mean? That uncanny valley thing
2:11:23
where something looks off. Nano Banana doesn't do that. It keeps you looking like you're right. Your face stays your
2:11:29
face. Your features stay your features. It just changes what you want changed. The character consistency is
2:11:34
mind-blowing. You can take the same person or pet and put them in different scenes, different clothes, different poses, different lighting, and they
2:11:41
still look exactly like themselves. This is huge for content creators. Think about this. You could create an entire
2:11:46
photo series with the same character without doing multiple photo shoots. You could test different product photos
2:11:52
without hiring models. You could create marketing images, without expensive equipment. Here's another crazy feature.
2:11:58
It can do precise local edits with just words. Want to blur the background? Just
2:12:03
ask. Want to remove a stain from your shirt? Tell it. Want to remove someone completely from a photo? Say the words.
2:12:09
Want to change someone's pose? Easy. Want to add color to a black and white photo? Done. This isn't just basic
2:12:15
editing. This is professional level stuff. And you don't need to know Photoshop. You don't need design skills.
2:12:21
You just need to know how to talk. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of
2:12:28
SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and
2:12:33
customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Let me tell you why this matters for your business. Content
2:12:39
is everything now. Social media, marketing, ads, everyone needs images, good images. But good images cost money
2:12:46
and time, lots of both. With Nano Banana, you can create professional images in seconds. Need product photos?
2:12:52
Make them. Need social media content? Create it. Need marketing images? Generate them. All with simple text
2:12:57
prompts. But here's something most people don't know. This tool can maintain consistency across multiple edits. You can have conversations with
2:13:04
it. You can say, "Make this change, then that change, then another change, and it remembers everything. It keeps track of
2:13:09
all your edits." This is where it gets really powerful for business. You can iterate on images in real time, test
2:13:16
different versions, try different styles, all without starting over each time. The multi-image fusion capability
2:13:22
is insane. You can combine photos in ways that look completely natural. Want to put your product in different
2:13:27
environments? Combine photos. Want to show your service in different locations? Merge images? Want to create
2:13:32
before and after shots? Blend pictures. Here's what Adobe said about it. They tested it and found notable strengths in
2:13:38
maintaining cross-edit coherence. That means when you make multiple changes, everything still looks natural together.
2:13:44
That's huge. Most AI tools break down when you ask for complex edits. They start looking fake or weird. Nano Banana
2:13:51
stays consistent. It preserves fine details. It keeps the overall scene looking real. For content creators, this
2:13:58
is a gamecher. You can create entire visual stories with one character. You can build brand consistency across all
2:14:04
your images. You can test concepts without expensive photooots. But let's talk about speed. This thing is fast.
2:14:10
Google built it on their flash architecture. That means results in seconds, not minutes. You type your prompt, hit enter, and boom, done.
2:14:18
Compare that to hiring a designer. First, you explain what you want. They create a draft. You give feedback. They
2:14:24
make changes back and forth for days. With Nano Banana, you get results instantly. The natural language
2:14:30
processing is incredible. You don't need to learn special commands or technical terms. You just talk to it like a
2:14:35
person. Remove the person in the back. Make the sky more blue. Add flowers to the garden. It understands. Here's
2:14:41
something cool. It's integrated right into Gemini. You don't need a separate app. You don't need new accounts. If you
2:14:48
use Gemini, you already have access. Just start uploading images and giving prompts. The quality is professional
2:14:54
grade. We're not talking about basic filters or simple effects. This creates images that look like they came from a
2:15:00
professional studio. The lighting is natural. The shadows make sense. The details are crisp. For businesses, this
2:15:06
opens up so many possibilities. Product cataloges with consistent lighting and backgrounds. Social media content that
2:15:13
matches your brand perfectly. marketing materials that look expensive but cost almost nothing to create. The style
2:15:19
transfer capabilities are amazing. You can take any image and change its artistic style while keeping the content
2:15:25
the same. Want your photo to look like a painting? Done. Want it to look like a sketch? Easy. Want it in a specific art
2:15:33
style? No problem. But here's what really makes this special. It's not just about creating new images. It's about
2:15:39
improving existing ones. Got old family photos that are faded? Restore them. Got
2:15:45
photos with bad lighting. Fix them. Got images with unwanted objects. Remove them. The precision is incredible. When
2:15:51
you ask it to remove something, it doesn't just delete it. It intelligently fills in what should be there. Remove a
2:15:57
person from a beach photo and it adds sand and waves that match perfectly. The pose alteration feature is mind-blowing.
2:16:04
You can change how someone is standing or sitting in a photo. The AI understands human anatomy and creates
2:16:10
natural looking poses. It's like having a professional photographer and model available anytime. Color correction
2:16:16
happens instantly. Black and white photos become full color with historically accurate tones. Faded
2:16:23
photos become vibrant again. Poorly lit photos become bright and clear. For social media managers, this is
2:16:29
incredible. You can create consistent visual content across all platforms. Same style, same quality, same brand
2:16:34
feel, but with unlimited variations and creativity. The background replacement is seamless. Unlike cheap green screen
2:16:40
effects, this looks natural. The lighting adjusts. The shadows match. The perspective stays correct. It's like your subject was always in that
2:16:46
location. With Nano Banana, you can create entire catalogs from basic product shots, different backgrounds,
2:16:53
different lighting, different presentations, all looking professional and consistent. The facial consistency
2:16:59
is incredible. If you're creating content with people, they stay looking like themselves across all variations.
2:17:04
No more weird AI faces that look almost human, but not quite. This solves one of the biggest problems in AI image
2:17:11
generation, the uncanny valley effect. When faces look almost real, but something feels off. Nano Banana doesn't
2:17:18
have this problem. Faces look natural and human. For personal use, imagine the possibilities. Family photos with
2:17:24
perfect lighting. Vacation photos with ideal weather. Group photos where everyone looks their best. All possible
2:17:31
with simple text commands. The speed makes iteration possible. Don't like the first result? Ask for changes
2:17:36
immediately. Try different approaches. Experiment freely. There's no cost for trying again. The integration with
2:17:42
Google's ecosystem is powerful. Create images in Gemini. Use them in Google Docs. Share them through Google Drive.
2:17:48
Everything works together seamlessly. Here's what makes this different from other AI image tools. Most focus on
2:17:54
creating new images from scratch. Nano Banana excels at editing and transforming existing images. That's
2:18:00
often more useful for real work. The quality consistency across different types of edits is remarkable. Whether
2:18:06
you're doing simple color correction or complex scene composition, the quality stays high. No drop off in different use
2:18:12
cases. For content creators building personal brands, this maintains visual consistency. Your face, your style, your
2:18:19
brand elements stay consistent across all content, but with unlimited creative variations. The cost savings for
2:18:25
businesses are massive. Professional photo editing costs hundreds per image. Photo shoots cost thousands. With Nano
2:18:32
Banana, you get professional results for almost nothing. The time savings are equally important. What used to take
2:18:37
days now takes minutes. What required specialized skills now needs just simple instructions. What costs thousands now
2:18:43
costs almost nothing. This democratizes professional image creation. Small businesses can compete with big brands
2:18:49
visually. Individual creators can produce studio quality content. The accessibility is incredible. No
2:18:55
technical skills needed. No expensive software. Just natural language and immediate results. This isn't just a
2:19:01
tool. It's a creative partner. It understands what you want and helps you achieve it. It maintains consistency. It
2:19:08
enables experimentation. The future of visual content creation is here. Google has created something that changes how
2:19:14
we think about images and creativity. Remember, 10 million people join Gemini in one week because of this feature.
2:19:20
That's real demand for real capability that solves real problems. The best part, you can start using it right now.
2:19:26
It's built into Gemini. No waiting lists. Just start uploading images and giving prompts. This is the future of
2:19:32
image editing and the future is available today. Julian Goldie reads every comment. So, make sure you comment

2:20:31
changed everything for building free tools that capture emails. I found a crazy combo that lets you build landing
2:20:37
pages in minutes. This is brand new stuff that's working right now. I'm talking zero coding skills needed and
2:20:44
it's bringing me thousands of visitors who want my products. So, here's what happened. I was trying to build free
2:20:49
tools for my SAS. You know, those little widgets that grab emails. The problem was always the same. Either I code for
2:20:56
hours or I pay a developer thousands. Then I found this combo that blew my mind. First tool is Gemini Canvas.
2:21:03
Second is Codeex. Together they're insane. Let me show you exactly what I did. I went to Gemini Canvas. I typed
2:21:09
one simple prompt. Make me a free blog image generator. Users put in their blog title. They pick square or landscape.
2:21:16
Then it makes a downloadable image for them. That's it. Gemini canvas built the entire tool. full working code,
2:21:23
interactive interface, everything worked perfectly. But here's where it gets crazy. I took that code to Codeex. I
2:21:30
told Codeex to make a complete landing page with email popup with my exact style in with amazing SEO. And guess
2:21:37
what happened next? Codeex built a full marketing page around my tool. Professional design, email capture,
2:21:43
pop-up, call to action buttons, the whole thing in under five minutes total. But wait, there's more. I didn't stop at
2:21:49
one tool. I made a second one. product title and description generator. Same process. Gemini Canvas builds the tool.
2:21:56
Codeex wraps it in a landing page. Now I have two free tools. Both capture emails. Both bring traffic. Both cost me
2:22:02
almost nothing to run. And here's the genius part. The tools work great. People love them. But they can only do
2:22:08
one at a time. So if someone wants to make 100 blog images, they'd have to
2:22:14
click 100 times. That's where I sell them my SAS. The email capture is forced
2:22:19
after 5 seconds. pop-up appears. You can't close it without entering your email. It remembers you for 30 days.
2:22:25
Then you get full access to the tool. I store everything in Superbase. I track which tool they used. Blog image
2:22:32
generator or product title tool. That way I can send targeted emails. If they use the image tool, I email about image
2:22:38
automation, smart segmentation, email marketing works better than anything, better than ads, better than social
2:22:44
media. When someone gives you their email for a free tool, they're already interested. They're warm leads. The
2:22:49
traffic potential is huge. Think about it. Someone searches free blog image generator on Google. They find my tool.
2:22:56
They use it. They love it. They join my email list. Then I sell them my full automation platform. Hey, if we haven't
2:23:02
met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie
2:23:07
Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates.
2:23:13
Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below. What's really smart about this strategy? The
2:23:19
tools don't cost much to run. Gemini Flash is super cheap. Even if someone makes 500 images, it costs me pennies.
2:23:26
But that person just gave me their email. That email could be worth hundreds or thousands over time. If you
2:23:31
want to scale your business and get more customers while saving hundreds with AI automation, join my AI profit boardroom.
2:23:38
It's the best place to learn these strategies. The whole process takes maybe 30 minutes. Gemini canvas builds
2:23:44
your tool. Copy the code, paste into codeex, tell it to make a landing page, add email capture, deploy to your site.
2:23:51
Done. You can make tools for any niche. Real estate calculators, fitness meal planners, business name generators,
2:23:57
social media caption creators. The possibilities are endless. Each tool becomes a traffic magnet. Each visitor
2:24:04
becomes an email subscriber. Each subscriber becomes a potential customer. It's a complete funnel built with AI in
2:24:10
minutes. The beauty is you're giving real value first. These tools actually work. People get something useful before
2:24:16
you ask for anything. That builds trust. Trust converts better than any sales pitch. My SAS platform is doing great
2:24:22
because of this strategy. We're getting 1,500 impressions per day on Google. Real organic traffic. People who
2:24:28
actually want automation tools, not random visitors who leave immediately. Google can be slow with new pages, but
2:24:34
once they index, the traffic flows. And unlike paid ads, this traffic is free forever. Here's what most people get
2:24:40
wrong about AI tools. They build the tool and stop there. They don't think about marketing. They don't capture
2:24:46
emails. They don't have a salesunnel, so they get no customers. I see this mistake everywhere. Someone builds an
2:24:51
amazing calculator or generator. They're so proud of the code. They think the hard work is done. Then they wonder why
2:24:57
nobody uses it. They get maybe 10 visitors a month, zero email signups,
2:25:02
zero sales. The tool sits there collecting digital dust. The problem is they think like developers, not
2:25:08
marketers. They focus on features instead of benefits. They worry about perfect code instead of perfect messaging. They spend weeks optimizing
2:25:15
load times but zero minutes on SEO. They build for themselves, not for customers. That's backwards thinking. Smart
2:25:20
entrepreneurs do the opposite. They start with the marketing. They ask what problem people actually have. What are
2:25:26
they searching for on Google? What would make them give their email? Then they build the simplest tool that solves that
2:25:31
problem. They spend more time on the landing page than the tool itself because the landing page makes money,
2:25:37
not the tool. The tool is just the beginning. The real money is in the follow-up, the email sequences, the
2:25:42
relationship building, the trust. That's where Codeex shines. It builds the entire marketing wrapper around your
2:25:48
tool. You want to build multiple tools. Each one targets different keywords, different search terms, cast a wide net.
2:25:55
More tools means more traffic entry points, more ways for people to find you. Make sure your tools solve real
2:26:00
problems. Blog images, product descriptions, social media posts, things people actually search for, tools
2:26:06
they'll bookmark and share with friends. The pop-up timing matters. 5 seconds gives people time to see the tool works.
2:26:12
Too fast and they bounce. Too slow and they might not convert. 5 seconds is the sweet spot. Remember to add clear calls
2:26:18
to action. Don't just collect emails and disappear. Tell people about your main product. Show how the free tool is just
2:26:24
a sample. Build desire for the full solution. Track everything. Which tools get the most use? Which ones convert
2:26:30
best? Which email campaigns work? Data drives decisions. Optimize based on real
2:26:35
results, not guesses. The competition will copy you. That's fine. By the time they figure it out, you'll have moved to
2:26:41
the next thing. First mover advantage is huge in SEO. Get there first. Rank first. This strategy works for any
2:26:47
business, not just SAS. Agencies can make audit tools. Coaches can make assessment tools. E-commerce can make
2:26:54
product finders. Everyone needs email lists. The key is speed. Gemini canvas
2:26:59
plus codeex makes this fast. Faster than hiring developers. Faster than learning
2:27:04
to code, faster than anything else I've tried. Speed means you can test more ideas, test different tool ideas, see
2:27:11
what gets traction, double down on what works, cut what doesn't. This isn't about perfection. It's about iteration
2:27:17
and improvement. Your free tools become your marketing team. Working 24/7,
2:27:22
capturing leads while you sleep, building your email list automatically. It's the closest thing to passive
2:27:27
marketing I've found. The best part, you own the traffic. Unlike social media where algorithms change, email lists are
2:27:33
yours. No one can take them away. That's real business security. So that's the system. Gemini canvas builds tools.
2:27:39
Codeex wraps them in landing pages. You capture emails, you nurture subscribers, you convert to customers. Simple but
2:27:45
powerful. And if you want to make more money with AI, welcome to the free AI money lab with Julian Goldie. Inside

2:28:22
marketing systems. This combo of Gemini, Canvas, and Codeex is your shortcut to that future. use it before everyone else
2:28:28
figures it out. Today, I'm going to show you the most insane AI update that just dropped. Google just released something
2:28:35
that will blow your mind. This new Gemini update can see you, talk to you, and help you in real time. It's like
2:28:41
having a super smart friend who never sleeps. And the best part, it's available right now. This is absolutely
2:28:47
crazy. Google just dropped an update that changes everything. I'm talking about real-time conversations with AI
2:28:53
that can see what you're doing and help you instantly. Imagine pointing your phone at something and having AI tell
2:28:59
you exactly what it is and how to use it. Or having a full conversation where you can interrupt the AI midsentence and
2:29:07
it responds perfectly. This isn't science fiction anymore. This is happening right now. Hey, if we haven't
2:29:12
met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie
2:29:18
Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. So,
2:29:25
what exactly did Google release? They just launched something called the live API with their new Gemini model. And
2:29:31
trust me, this is bigger than anything we've seen before. No. First, let me tell you about the native audio feature.
2:29:37
Before this update, when you talk to AI, it had to convert your voice to text. Think about it. Then, convert the answer
2:29:44
back to speech. That's three steps. Now, it's direct audio to audio. No more robotic voices. No more weird pauses. It
2:29:51
sounds like you're talking to a real person. But here's where it gets really wild. This new Gemini can see what
2:29:56
you're looking at through your camera and it doesn't just see it. It can highlight things on your screen and
2:30:02
point them out to you. Picture this. You're looking at your car engine and you don't know what something is. You
2:30:07
point your phone at it and Gemini draws a box around the part and tells you exactly what it does. The speed is
2:30:13
insane, too. We're talking about responses in milliseconds, not seconds. Milliseconds. You can literally
2:30:18
interrupt the AI while it's talking and it will stop and answer your new question immediately. Try doing that
2:30:24
with any other AI right now. You can't. And this isn't just for basic questions. Google built something called the agent
2:30:30
development kit. This lets developers build voice assistants that can actually do things for you. Not just answer
2:30:36
questions, actually take actions, book meetings, search the web, run code, all
2:30:42
while having a normal conversation with you. Here's what most people don't understand yet. This isn't just an
2:30:48
upgrade. This is a complete shift in how we interact with AI. Instead of typing and waiting, you're having real
2:30:54
conversations. Instead of describing what you see, the AI can see it, too. Let me break down the technical stuff in
2:31:00
simple terms. The old way was like sending letters back and forth. You write something, send it, wait for a response, then write again. The new way
2:31:06
is like having a phone call. Both people can talk, listen, and respond naturally. But wait, there's more. And this part is
2:31:12
going to shock you. Gemini can now work with video, too. You can send it a video URL and it will analyze the entire
2:31:18
thing, summarize it, translate it, answer questions about what happened. We're talking about understanding hours
2:31:24
of video content in seconds. Now, here's where this gets really interesting for business owners. Remember how I
2:31:29
mentioned the agent development kit? This means you can build custom AI assistants for your specific business on
2:31:35
AI that knows your products, your services, your customers, and it can have real conversations with them. If
2:31:41
you want to stay ahead of the curve with AI updates like this, and learn how to actually make money with these tools,
2:31:47
you need to join my AI profit boardroom. It's the best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save
2:31:53
hundreds of hours with AI automation. The link is in the description below. Think about customer service. Instead of
2:31:59
waiting on hold for 20 minutes, customers could have an instant conversation with an AI that actually
2:32:04
understands their problem and can solve it. Not just read from a script, actually solve problems. For content
2:32:10
creators like me, this opens up incredible possibilities. Imagine live streaming where your AI assistant can
2:32:16
see your screen, help you with research in real time, and even interact with your audience. The creative
2:32:21
possibilities are endless. But here's the thing most people will miss. Google isn't just improving their AI. They're
2:32:27
changing how we think about AI interaction entirely. This live API isn't just about better responses. It's
2:32:33
about creating AI that feels alive. The visual guidance feature alone is gamechanging. Instead of trying to
2:32:39
describe something complex, you just show it. The AI sees exactly what you see and can guide you through any
2:32:44
process. Car repairs, cooking, home improvement, you name it. Let's talk about the models themselves for a
2:32:50
second. Google is retiring their old 1.5 models and focusing everything on the 2.0 and 2.5 versions. The new flash
2:32:57
models are built for speed. The native audio models create more natural speech, and they're all designed to work
2:33:03
together seamlessly. But here's what really excites me. This is just the beginning. Google is already working on
2:33:09
connecting this to robotics. Imagine AI assistants that can see, hear, speak,
2:33:15
and actually move around in the physical world. We're talking about the first steps toward truly helpful AI
2:33:20
companions. Now, I know what you're thinking. This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch? Well, some of
2:33:25
these features are still in private preview. You might need to join a wait list. And the really advanced stuff like
2:33:31
native audio might not be available to everyone yet. But here's my prediction.
2:33:36
Within six months, this technology will be everywhere. Every app, every website, every business will want this kind of AI
2:33:43
interaction. The companies that adopt it first will have a massive advantage. For
2:33:49
entrepreneurs and business owners, this is your wakeup call. The businesses that figure out how to use this technology
2:33:54
will dominate their industries. The ones that ignore it will get left behind. The content creation possibilities alone are
2:34:01
incredible. Imagine creating videos where your AI assistant helps you research topics in real time or having
2:34:08
live conversations with AI that your audience can watch and learn from. And for agencies like mine, this opens up
2:34:13
entirely new service offerings. We can build custom AI assistants for clients that actually understand their business
2:34:19
and can have intelligent conversations with their customers. The speed of innovation is accelerating. We went from
2:34:24
basic chat bots to this in just two years. What will the next two years bring? Full AI companions. AI that can
2:34:30
see, hear, speak, and take physical actions. We're living in the most exciting time in human history. Here's
2:34:36
what you need to do right now. First, go test out the current Gemini Live features that are available. Get
2:34:41
familiar with how real time AI conversation works. Second, start thinking about how this could apply to
2:34:47
your business or projects. The technical architecture behind this is fascinating, too. Google built this using websocket
2:34:53
connections for continuous streaming. Instead of the old request and response model, you have a persistent connection
2:34:59
that can handle audio, video, and text simultaneously. The model can process multiple input types at once while
2:35:05
generating responses in real time. The visual guidance system uses advanced computer vision to identify objects in
2:35:11
real time and overlay digital information on top of them. Think augmented reality, but powered by the
2:35:17
smartest AI we've ever seen. You can point your phone at any appliance in your home and get instant
2:35:22
troubleshooting. help with visual indicators showing exactly where to look. But here's something most people
2:35:27
aren't talking about yet. The implications for accessibility are huge. People who struggle with traditional
2:35:32
text interfaces now have natural conversation options, visual impairments, motor difficulties,
2:35:37
language barriers. This technology breaks down so many barriers to accessing information and getting help.
2:35:43
The model variants are interesting, too. Flash models prioritize speed for interactive use cases. Pro models offer
2:35:49
deeper reasoning for complex problems. The native audio preview models focus specifically on natural speech
2:35:55
generation. The developer ecosystem around this is exploding too. The agent development kit gives programmers
2:36:01
everything they need to build custom voice agents. Sample code, architectural patterns, best practices. Google is
2:36:08
making it as easy as possible for developers to create amazing experiences with this technology. Cost implications
2:36:13
are significant too. Real-time streaming and low latency processing requires more computational resources. But Google is
2:36:20
betting that the improved user experience justifies the higher costs. And honestly, when you experience how
2:36:26
natural these interactions feel, it's hard to go back to typing and waiting. Looking at the competitive landscape,
2:36:32
this puts enormous pressure on OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies. Textbased chat bots suddenly feel
2:36:38
primitive compared to full multimodal real-time conversation. Everyone else is playing catch-up now. The privacy
2:36:45
considerations are important, too. Real-time audio and video processing means more data flowing through Google's
2:36:50
systems. They've published guidelines for developers about consent and data handling, but users need to understand
2:36:56
what they're sharing when they use these features. But most importantly, you need to stay educated on these updates. The
2:37:02
AI landscape is changing so fast that what's cutting edge today will be basic tomorrow. That's why I created the free
2:37:09
AI money lab. Inside, you'll get 50 plus free AI tools and 200 plus chat GBT SEO
2:37:15
prompts. You'll learn how to make money with AI agents, get over 1,000 free workflows, and see exactly how one
2:37:21
member made over $10,000 with Chat GPT. Plus, you'll get a full blueprint to generate thousands of leads free with
2:37:28
AI. You also get access to our free AI community, free AI course, and proven AI
2:37:33
case studies. The link is in the description. Google just dropped something that changes everything for AI coding. Your AI can now see what it
2:37:40
builds in real time. No more guessing if your code actually works. and I'm going to show you exactly how to use it to
2:37:46
build apps faster than ever before. Okay, Google released this thing called Chrome DevTools MCP and nobody's talking
2:37:54
about it. But this is massive. Like actually massive. Here's the problem with AI coding right now. Your AI writes
2:38:00
code, but it can't see what happens when that code runs. It's like trying to paint with your eyes closed. You have no
2:38:06
idea if what you made looks good or terrible. So what happens? Your AI builds something. You open it. It's
2:38:12
broken. You go back, tell the AI what's wrong, it tries again, still broken. You're stuck in this loop forever.
2:38:19
Chrome DevTools MCP fixes this. Your AI can now open a browser, go to your
2:38:24
website, check for errors, look at performance all by itself. No more back and forth. No more broken code sitting
2:38:30
there for 20 minutes while you debug. And wait until you see what this means for building apps. I'll show you in a
2:38:35
second. But first, let me explain how this actually works because it's kind of crazy. So MCP stands for model context
2:38:41
protocol. It's basically a way for AI to connect to tools. And Chrome DevTools MCP lets your AI connect directly to
2:38:48
Chrome browser tools. The same tools developers use every single day. Your AI can now navigate web pages, fill out
2:38:55
forms, check console logs, run performance tests, look at network requests, everything a human developer
2:39:01
would do, except it happens automatically. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of
2:39:07
Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get
2:39:13
more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Julian Goldie reads every comment, so
2:39:19
make sure you comment below. Google says, "Coding agents have been programming with a blindfold on. Now the
2:39:25
blindfold is off." And that changes everything about how fast you can build stuff. Here's what you can actually do
2:39:31
with this. First, you can verify code changes in real time. Your AI writes some code, opens the browser, checks if
2:39:38
it works, finds errors, fixes them all without you doing anything. Second, performance testing. You can tell your
2:39:44
AI to check how fast your website loads. It will run a full performance test, give you the LCP score, tell you what's
2:39:51
slowing things down, suggest fixes, then actually implement those fixes. Third, debug in live pages. Got a styling
2:39:58
issue, layout broken. Your AI can inspect the DOM, look at the CSS, figure out what's wrong, fix it. Fourth,
2:40:04
testing user flows. Your AI can click through your entire app, fill out forms, submit data, make sure everything works
2:40:11
end to end. And here's the crazy part. This used to take hours. Now it takes minutes. Let me show you how this
2:40:17
actually works in practice. I've been using this with my AI coding setup. And it's insane how much faster things move.
2:40:23
So I use this with Kilo. Kilo is an AI coding tool that works really well with
2:40:29
MCP servers. I pair it with GLM 4.6 model. That's a coding model that's
2:40:35
really good at building apps. Here's what I do. I tell the AI to build something. Let's say a mind sweeper
2:40:40
game. Just a random example. The AI writes all the code. Then automatically it uses Chrome DevTools MCP, opens the
2:40:47
game in a browser, checks for console errors, looks at performance, tests if everything works. If there's an error,
2:40:53
it sees it immediately, goes back, fixes the code, tests again, all without me touching anything. This is huge for
2:40:58
front-end development because front end is all about how things look and work in the browser. And now your AI can
2:41:04
actually see that. And here's something really smart you can do. Create a rules file for your AI. Tell it to always use
2:41:10
Chrome DevTools MCP after writing front-end code. So every time it builds something visual, it automatically tests
2:41:16
it, checks for errors, verifies performance. You you don't even have to ask. Now, at this point, you might be
2:41:22
wondering, okay, this sounds cool, but how hard is it to set up? And that's the best part. It's actually super easy. If
2:41:28
you want the full AI coding setup, join my AI profit boardroom. That's where I show you exactly how to set up tools
2:41:34
like this, how to automate your business with AI, how to get more customers, how to save hundreds of hours. It's the best
2:41:41
place to scale your business with AI automation. Link is in the description, but let me give you the quick version
2:41:47
right now. You need an AI coding tool that supports MCP. I use Kilo, but there are others. Then you add the Chrome
2:41:53
DevTools MCP server to your config. That's literally it. One config file.
2:41:58
Copy paste. Done. Once it's set up, you can use it with any AI model that works
2:42:03
with your coding tool. I like GLM 4.6 because it's really good at coding tasks, but you could use Claude, you
2:42:10
could use GPT, whatever works for you. Google also recommends using it with Gemini CLI. That's their command line
2:42:16
tool. It's free and it's been fine-tuned to work really well with this MCP. So, if you want to use it for research tasks
2:42:23
or general automation, Gemini CLI is probably your best bet. But for coding, I prefer Kilo with GLM. It just works
2:42:30
better for building actual apps. Now, here's what I really love about this. It makes AI coding feel way more reliable
2:42:37
because the biggest problem with AI coding is you never know if the code actually works until you test it
2:42:42
yourself. And testing takes time. With Chrome DevTools MCP, testing happens automatically. Your AI knows immediately
2:42:50
if something broke. It can fix bugs before you even see them. That's a massive timesaver. I've been using three
2:42:56
MCP servers regularly. Chrome Dev Tools for browser testing, Context 7 for
2:43:01
fetching documentation, and Bite Rover for memory management. Byte Rover is really cool, by the way. It lets your AI
2:43:08
create memories of important stuff like architecture, decisions, code patterns you like, things you want it to remember
2:43:14
for later. Those memories sync across your team, too. So, everyone's AI has the same context. Think about it like
2:43:21
this. You're working on a project for weeks. Your AI learns how you like things done, what frameworks you prefer,
2:43:27
what coding style you use. Normally, all that context gets lost when you start a new chat. With Bite Rover, it stays.
2:43:34
Your AI remembers everything. And here's where it gets really powerful. You can manually edit these memories. So, if
2:43:40
your AI remembers something wrong, you just go in and fix it, like updating a note. Super simple. And those changes
2:43:46
sync across your whole team instantly. It's basically like giving your AI a
2:43:51
brain that actually works long term instead of forgetting everything every single conversation. This is huge for
2:43:57
bigger projects where you need consistency where you can't afford to explain the same things over and over.
2:44:03
But Chrome DevTools MCP is probably the most practical one for day-to-day coding
2:44:08
because you're always building stuff that runs in a browser. And now your AI can actually see what it builds. Google
2:44:14
says they're going to keep improving this over time, adding more features,
2:44:19
more capabilities, which makes sense because this is officially supported by Google. It's not
2:44:25
some random side project. They're investing in it. And I think we're going to see a lot more tools like this, tools
2:44:31
that give AI access to developer environments because that's the missing piece right now. AI can write code, but
2:44:37
it can't interact with the environment where that code runs. This fixes that. So, what what does this mean for you? If
2:44:43
you're building apps with AI, this makes your life way easier. If you're not using AI to build apps yet, this is a
2:44:49
good reason to start because the gap between what you can build manually and what AI can build is getting bigger
2:44:55
every day. And tools like Chrome, DevTools, MCP, are making AI coding more powerful, more reliable, more useful.

2:46:05
how to actually use them to make money and grow your business. That's it for today. See you in the next one. Today
2:46:11
I'm going to show you which AI model actually wins when it comes to real business tasks. I just ran the most
2:46:17
comprehensive AI test ever. Five brutal business challenges. Three top AI models. The results will shock you. One,
2:46:24
AI completely failed a basic task. Another dominated content creation. And the third one surprised everyone with
2:46:30
its speed. This could save you thousands of dollars and hours of wasted time. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the
2:46:36
digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and
2:46:43
customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. You know what drives me crazy? Everyone's talking about which
2:46:49
AI is best, but nobody's actually testing them on real business tasks. Everyone just asks them to write a poem
2:46:56
or solve a math problem that's useless. So, I decided to do something different. I created five brutal business tests,
2:47:03
real tasks that you and I face every single day. SEO analysis, content creation, strategic planning, the works,
2:47:10
and I put three of the hottest AI models through the ringer. Gro 4, Claude for Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. What I found
2:47:18
will change how you think about AI forever. Let me break this down for you. First, let me tell you about the testing
2:47:24
method because this wasn't some casual comparison. This was scientific. This was real. I created five different
2:47:31
business scenarios. Each one designed to test a different skill that matters in business. Researchability, content
2:47:37
creation, strategic thinking, technical knowledge, speed. Every test had clear
2:47:42
evaluation criteria. I measured speed. I measured accuracy. I measured quality.
2:47:47
And I scored everything on a point system so there was no bias. And I'm going to share the exact prompts I used.
2:47:53
So you can test these yourself. You can see if you get the same results. You can use these prompts in your own business. Test one was SEO competitive analysis.
2:48:01
This is something I do every single day in my agency. I gave each AI model a scenario where they're running a project
2:48:08
management software company. They had to analyze competitors like Asana and Monday.com, find keyword opportunities,
2:48:14
identify content gaps, create a six-month strategy. Here's the exact prompt I used. I run a midsize SAS
2:48:21
company selling project management software. Our main competitors are Asana, Monday.com, and Trello. Create a
2:48:28
comprehensive SEO competitive analysis that includes one, identify 10 high-value keyword opportunities where
2:48:34
we could outrank these competitors. Two, analyze their content gaps we could exploit. Three, recommend a six-month
2:48:42
SEO strategy with specific tactics and expected timeline for results. Include reasoning for your recommendations.
2:48:49
This is complex stuff. This requires research skills, strategic thinking,
2:48:54
business understanding. And here's what happened. Grock 4 absolutely crushed this test. It delivered the most
2:49:01
comprehensive report I've ever seen from an AI. Detailed tables, extensive data analysis, strategic insights that
2:49:07
actually made sense. The organization was perfect. The visual presentation was clean. Claude the fourth Sonic came in
2:49:14
second. strong analytical depth, good strategic recommendations, well structured, but just not as
2:49:20
comprehensive as Grock. Gemini 2.5 Pro, it was the fastest by far. But the analysis was basic, surface level, and
2:49:26
not enough depth for real strategic decision-making. So, after test one, Grock was leading. Test two was content
2:49:33
creation. I asked each AI to write a complete 1,500word blog post for a cyber
2:49:39
security company. Target keyword was endpoint security best practices 2025
2:49:44
had to include SEO optimization, proper heading structure, actionable advice,
2:49:50
internal linking opportunities. A compelling call to action. Here's the exact prompt. Write a complete 1,500word
2:49:58
blog post for our B2B cyber security company targeting IT directors at midsize companies with 500 to 2,000
2:50:06
employees. Primary keyword endpoint security best practices 2025 include one
2:50:13
SEO optimized title and meta description. Two, proper heading structure H1 to H3. Three, five
2:50:20
actionable best practices with real world examples. Four, internal linking opportunities suggest. Three, five, a
2:50:26
compelling CTA for our endpoint security audit. Make it authoritative but accessible avoiding technical jargon.
2:50:33
This is bread and butter content marketing, something every business needs. and Claude Forson on it destroyed this test. It delivered 1,620
2:50:40
words of absolutely beautiful content. The SEO optimization was perfect.
2:50:46
Natural keyword integration. The structure was clean. The readability was incredible. It felt like a human expert
2:50:51
wrote it. Gemini 2.5 Pro came in second with 1529 words. Good content quality,
2:50:58
proper SEO elements, solid performance across the board. But here's where things got interesting. Grock 4 had a
2:51:05
massive problem. It claimed it wrote 1,512 words, but when I counted only 1,221
2:51:12
words. That's a huge accuracy issue. You can't trust an AI that lies about word count. What else is it lying about? So,
2:51:19
after test two, Claude was catching up. Test three was content repurposing. I I
2:51:24
gave them a high performing blog post about remote team management. 3,000 words that generated 15,000 organic
2:51:31
views and 200 leads. Real numbers from real campaigns. I asked them to turn
2:51:37
this into eight different content formats. LinkedIn carousel, email newsletter series, Twitter thread,
2:51:43
YouTube script, infographic outline, podcast brief, Instagram stories, short
2:51:48
form video script. Here's the exact prompt. We have a high-erforming 30,000word blog post about remote team
2:51:54
management strategies that generated 15,000 organic views and 200 leads. Transform this single piece into eight
2:52:00
different content formats for maximum reach. One, LinkedIn carousel post. Two,
2:52:05
email newsletter series. Three-part. Three, Twitter thread. Four, YouTube video script 8 to 10 minutes. Five,
2:52:13
infographic outline. Six, podcast episode brief. Seven, Instagram story series. Eight. Short form video script
2:52:19
60 seconds. Provide the actual content scripts, not just ideas. This tests
2:52:25
creativity adaptation skills. Platform understanding. Claude for Sonic won again. And it wasn't even close. The
2:52:31
copyrightiting was exceptional. The hooks were incredible. Each piece of content was perfectly optimized for its platform. The quality stayed high across
2:52:38
all eight formats. Gemini 2.5 Pro came second. Good adaptation skills, solid
2:52:44
content, but missing that creative spark. Grock 4 was adequate, functional, but boring. No compelling hooks, no
2:52:51
engagement. Claude was pulling ahead. Test four was editorial calendar development. Create a 90-day content
2:52:57
calendar for a project management tool. Target keywords around project management tips and team productivity.
2:53:03
Include content clusters, seasonal topics, lead magnets, promotion strategy. Here's the exact prompt I
2:53:09
used. Create a 90-day content calendar for our SAS project management tool targeting small business owners and team
2:53:15
leaders. We want to rank for project management tips, team productivity, and
2:53:21
small business efficiency. Include one, 24 blog post topics with target keywords
2:53:26
and search intent. Two, content cluster strategy linking related posts. Three,
2:53:32
seasonal trending topic integration. Four, lead magnet content three pieces.
2:53:37
Five, content promotion strategy for each post format as a detailed calendar with publication dates, word counts, and
2:53:44
success metrics. This is strategic planning at its finest. And here's where
2:53:49
things got interesting. Both Grock 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro tied for first place.
2:53:55
Both delivered excellent table-based organization, comprehensive planning, detailed timelines and metrics,
2:54:00
strategic thinking, visual clarity that made the plans immediately actionable. Claude the fourth sonic came third. good
2:54:06
analysis and recommendations, comprehensive, but it lacked the superior organization of the other two.
2:54:12
So, we had a three-way race going into the final test. Test five was technical SEO audit. I gave them a 500page
2:54:19
e-commerce website with multiple technical issues, duplicate title tags, slow site speed, broken links, missing
2:54:27
structured data, missing alt text, outdated XML sitemap, limited
2:54:32
development resources, only 20 hours per month. Here's the exact prompt. I'm the CMO of a 500page e-commerce website. Our
2:54:40
developer found these technical issues. One, 127 pages with duplicate title
2:54:45
tags. Two, site speed averaging 4.2 seconds on mobile. Three, 23 broken
2:54:51
internal links. Four, missing structured data on product pages. Five, 15% of
2:54:56
images missing alt text. Six, XML sitemap hasn't been updated in 8 months.
2:55:01
We have limited development resources 20 hours per month. Create a priority matrix ranking these issues by SEO
2:55:08
impact versus implementation effort and provide a three-month implementation road map. They had to create a priority
2:55:15
matrix rank issues by SEO impact versus implementation effort. Provide a
2:55:21
three-month road map. Both Grock 4 and Claude for Sonnet tied for first. Excellent strategic road maps, strong
2:55:27
prioritization logic, clear implementation paths, deep technical SEO understanding, practical resource
2:55:33
allocation. Gemini 2.5 Pro came third. Adequate technical understanding, but
2:55:38
missing the strategic depth and implementation detail. But wait, I wasn't done testing yet. I wanted to see
2:55:44
how these AIs handled something completely different. Game development. Because if you can build games, you can
2:55:49
build anything. So, I threw two more brutal tests at them. Test six was building a Minecraft inspired 3D world
2:55:55
generator using p5.gs. This is hardcore coding, real programming skills. Here's the exact
2:56:01
prompt. Build a Minecraft inspired 3D world generator using p5gs. Create one,
2:56:07
a 20x20 grid of procedurally generated terrain with different block types, grass, stone, dirt, water. Two,
2:56:15
firsterson camera controls. Where's the movement mouse look? Three, block placement removal system, left right
2:56:22
click. Four, at least four different block textures. Five, simple lighting or shading effects. Six, inventory system
2:56:29
showing available blocks. Seven, save, load, world state functionality. Focus
2:56:34
on performance. It should run smoothly at 30 plus frames pers. Include chunkbased loading for scalability.
2:56:41
This is insanely complex. 3D graphics, game mechanics, performance optimization, user interface, data
2:56:48
persistence. Claude for Sonet won this round. It actually created a game not fully playable, but it built something
2:56:55
that resembled what I asked for. The code structure was solid. The approach was logical. Grock 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro,
2:57:02
they finished fast, but the code was full of errors, broken functionality, incomplete features, speed without
2:57:09
substance. Then I hit them with test seven, a 2D endless runner game. Here's the prompt. Create a complete 2D endless
2:57:16
runner game using HTML 5 canvas and JavaScript. The game should include one, a character that can jump to avoid
2:57:22
obstacles. Two, randomly generated obstacles moving from right to left. Three, score system that increases over
2:57:28
time. Four, game over screen with restart functionality. Five, progressive difficulty. Obstacles get faster. Six,
2:57:36
simple particle effects when jumping or colliding. make it fully playable with smooth animations and responsive
2:57:42
controls. Include proper game state management and clean commented code.
2:57:47
Clawed Force on it absolutely destroyed this test. It created a completely playable game. Smooth animations,
2:57:54
responsive controls, progressive difficulty, particle effects, game state management, everything worked perfectly.
2:58:01
The game was actually hard but so fun to play like a real indie game you'd find on Steam. Grock 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
2:58:08
Same story. Fast responses, broken code, lots of errors, incomplete functionality. This revealed something
2:58:15
huge about these AIs. So, what were the final results after all seven tests?
2:58:20
Claude Force Sonic won four solo victories and one co-win. Six out of seven strong performances. Absolutely
2:58:26
dominant. Grock 4 won one solo victory and two co-wins. Three out of seven strong performances. Gemini 2.5 Pro won
2:58:33
zero solo victories and one co-ind. One out of seven strong performances. But here's what really matters. The
2:58:39
insights. Claude for Sonnet isn't just good at content creation. It's exceptional at complex coding tasks.
2:58:45
Game development, interactive applications, advanced programming challenges. When you need something that
2:58:50
actually works, Claude delivers. Grock 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are fast. But fast
2:58:56
doesn't matter if the code is broken, if the functionality doesn't work, if you can't actually use what they create.
2:59:03
This is the difference between an AI that can help you build a real business versus an AI that just gives you pretty
2:59:09
responses that don't work. Claude Forson is the king of content creation, blog posts, copywriting, content repurposing.
2:59:16
If you're doing content marketing, this is your AI. The quality is consistently excellent. The engagement is superior.
2:59:22
The readability is perfect. But that's not all. Claude also dominates complex coding tasks, game development,
2:59:27
interactive applications, advanced programming. When you need code that actually works, Claude is your AI. Grock
2:59:33
4 is the analysis beast. Competitive research, strategic planning, comprehensive reporting. If you need
2:59:39
deep analysis, and strategic thinking, this is your AI. The organization is excellent. The visual presentation is
2:59:45
clean. Gemini 2.5 Pro is the speed demon. Fastest response times by far.
2:59:50
Good content quality for basic tasks. Reliable performance for simple requests. If you need quick turnaround,
2:59:56
and speed is more important than quality or functionality, this is your AI. But here's the thing that nobody talks
3:00:02
about. Different A is for different tasks. You don't need to pick just one. In my agency, we use Claude for all our
3:00:10
content creation, blog posts for clients, email campaigns, social media content. It's unmatched. We use Grock
3:00:17
for competitive analysis, market research, strategic planning. When we need comprehensive reports for clients,
3:00:24
we use Gemini when we need quick answers, fast research, rapid content for social media, time-sensitive
3:00:30
projects. It's like having different tools in a toolbox. You don't use a hammer for everything. But if I had to
3:00:35
pick just one AI for business, Claude Force on it, here's why. Content is everything in business today. Content
3:00:40
marketing drives leads, copywriting drives sales, email campaigns drive revenue, social media content builds
3:00:47
brands, and Claude dominates content creation. But here's what shocked me the most. Claude also dominates coding, real
3:00:53
development work, functional applications, interactive tools. This means Claude can help you build the
3:00:59
entire business ecosystem. Content to attract customers, code to serve customers, everything you need in one
3:01:06
AI. Plus, Claude's consistency is incredible. Every single test, it delivered highquality results. You can
3:01:13
trust it. Grock's word count issue in the blog post test is concerning. If it lies about something basic like word
3:01:19
count, what else might it get wrong? Speed is nice, but quality matters more. Would you rather have a fast AI that
3:01:26
gives you mediocre content or a slightly slower AI that gives you incredible content? I know which one I choose, but
3:01:33
only if you use it correctly. Only if you go beyond the surface level stuff, only if you treat it like the powerful
3:01:39
business tool it actually is. These test results prove that AI can handle complex business tasks, real work, real value.
3:01:46
The question is, are you ready to take advantage of it? Are you ready to use AI to scale your business, get more
3:01:52
customers, save hundreds of hours, or are you going to keep using it to write poems? The choice is yours. But I know
3:01:59
what successful entrepreneurs choose. They choose results over entertainment, business value over party tricks, real
3:02:05
applications over fun experiments. That's what separates successful people from everyone else. They see the
3:02:11
opportunity, they take action, they get results. If you want to join them, if you want to scale your business with AI,
3:02:17
I have three ways I can help you right now. First, if you're serious about using AI to scale your business, check

3:03:26
the next video. Today, I'm going to show you Google's
3:03:32
brand new AI coding agent that just dropped, and it's completely free. This thing can build entire apps from your
3:03:39
terminal. It can fix broken code. It can even create slide decks from your GitHub projects. And here's the crazy part. It
3:03:46
takes less than 2 minutes to set up. I'm going to walk you through exactly how to get this running. Plus, I'll show you
3:03:51
the one mistake everyone's making that breaks it instantly. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of
3:03:57
Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get
3:04:02
more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Let me be real with you. I've tested Claude
3:04:09
Code. I've tested all the other AI agents. But this one is different. Google just released something that
3:04:15
could put a lot of paid tools out of business. And most people don't even know it exists yet. So, if you want to
3:04:21
build apps without knowing how to code, stay tuned because by the end of this video, you'll have a free AI developer
3:04:26
working for you 24/7. Julian Goldie reads every comment. So, make sure you comment below and let me know what you
3:04:32
think about this new tool. All right, let's dive in. So, Google just dropped this thing called Gemini CLI, and it's
3:04:39
basically like having a coding expert sitting right next to you, except this expert never gets tired, never asks for
3:04:45
arrays, and works for free. Here's what makes this different from everything else out there. Most AI coding tools
3:04:51
just write code. This thing actually runs the code for you. It opens files. It launches apps in your browser. It can
3:04:57
even do Google searches while it's coding. And get this, it's open source, completely free. You get 10,000 model
3:05:03
requests per day. That's way more than most people will ever use. But here's where it gets interesting. This isn't
3:05:08
just for developers. I don't code. I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time. But I can now build apps with
3:05:14
this. And if I can do it, anyone can do it. Let me show you exactly how to set this up. And I'll show you some real
3:05:19
examples of what this thing can build. First, you need NodeJS version 18 or
3:05:24
higher. Don't worry, it's free and takes 2 seconds to install. I'll put the link in the comments. Then you open your
3:05:30
terminal. If you're on Mac, just search for terminal. If you're on Windows, search for command prompt. Now, here's
3:05:36
the magic command. You type mpm install g Google generative AI client. Hit enter
3:05:42
and boom, it starts installing. The setup is ridiculously easy. It asks you to pick a color theme. I went with the
3:05:49
default. Then it asks you to authenticate. You can use your API key if you have one, or you can just loging
3:05:55
in with Google. I clicked login with Google. It opens a browser window. You sign in and that's it. You're done. The whole setup took me less than 2 minutes.
3:06:02
Compare that to some other tools that take hours to configure. Now, here's where it gets fun. You can start giving it commands immediately. I typed, "Are
3:06:10
you working?" And it replied, "Yes, how can I help?" That's when I knew this thing was legit. So, let's test it out
3:06:16
with something real. I said, "Write a new Discord bot that answers questions using the FAQ file." And it started
3:06:22
coding right in front of me, building the entire bot from scratch. But here's what blew my mind. It doesn't just write
3:06:28
the code and leave you hanging. It explains what it's doing. It asks if you want to run the code and it can even
3:06:33
launch the finished product in your browser. Let me give you another example. I asked it to create a slide deck based on a GitHub project. Now,
3:06:39
normally this would take hours of work. You'd have to analyze the code, write the content, design the slides, format
3:06:45
everything. This thing did it in minutes. It went to the GitHub repo, analyzed all the code, created a
3:06:51
markdown file with the slide content, then converted it to HTML, and launched it in my browser. Was the design
3:06:57
perfect? No. But did it work? Absolutely. And here's the best part. When I didn't like the design, I just
3:07:03
said, "Make the UI more beautiful." And it redesigned the whole thing, added
3:07:09
better colors, improved the layout, made it look professional. I felt like I had a personal developer working for me. But
3:07:15
wait, there's more. This thing can do way more than just coding. You can say things like, I give me a summary of all
3:07:20
the changes that went in yesterday and it'll analyze your entire project and give you a report or help me migrate
3:07:27
this codebase and it'll walk you through the entire migration process or make a
3:07:32
full screen web app for a wall display to show our most important issues. The possibilities are endless. Now, I want
3:07:39
to show you something really cool. I asked it to build an SEO calculator just to see what would happen. And I said, "Code out an SEO calculator. Make sure
3:07:46
the UI is as engaging as possible." And boom, it started building. Created the HTML, added the CSSE styling, built the
3:07:54
JavaScript functionality, and launched it in my browser. The whole thing took maybe 5 minutes, and I now have a
3:07:59
working SEO calculator that I can use for my clients. Think about this for a second. I just saved hours of
3:08:04
development work, and I didn't pay a single dollar for it. This is why I think this tool could put a lot of paid alternatives out of business. Now, let
3:08:11
me be honest with you. It's not perfect. I ran into some bugs during my testing. Sometimes it switches from the smart
3:08:16
model to the faster model when there's high demand. And the faster model isn't as good. When that happens, the outputs
3:08:24
get worse, the code isn't as clean, and sometimes it just breaks completely. But here's the fix. If it breaks, just close
3:08:30
the terminal, run the installation command again, and start fresh. Takes 30 seconds. The other thing is speed.
3:08:36
Sometimes it's fast, sometimes it's slow. Depends on how many people are using it. But even with these issues,
3:08:42
this thing is incredible for a free tool. Now, let me compare this to some other options out there. Claude Code has
3:08:49
been trending like crazy and it's good, but you have to pay for it after the free tier and the setup is more
3:08:55
complicated. GitHub Copilot is also solid, but again, you're paying monthly
3:09:01
and it just writes code. It doesn't run it for you. Cursor is another popular option, but same story, paid limited
3:09:07
features in the free version. This Google tool gives you most of the same functionality for free with unlimited
3:09:14
use up to a thousand requests per day. That's a gamecher. Now, here's something interesting. You can actually use this
3:09:20
with your existing projects, not just new ones. Say you have a website that's been sitting around for months. You can
3:09:25
navigate to that folder in your terminal. Then ask Gemini CLI to analyze it, improve it, add new features, fix
3:09:32
bugs. It can read all your files, understand your code structure, and make intelligent suggestions. I tested this
3:09:39
with an old project of mine. Asked it to add mobile responsiveness to a website that was only desktop friendly. It went
3:09:44
through every file, updated the CSS, added media queries, and made the whole site mobile friendly. That would have
3:09:51
taken me days to figure out. It did it in an hour. This is the power of having an AI that can actually interact with
3:09:57
your file system. It's not just giving you code snippets. It's working on your actual project. And here's another cool
3:10:03
feature. You can ask it to organize your files, convert file formats, even analyze your spending from PDF invoices.
3:10:10
Someone in the comments asked if it can fix broken video files. I don't know, but given what I've seen, I wouldn't be
3:10:16
surprised. The key is that this isn't just a coding tool. It's a general purpose AI assistant that happens to be
3:10:21
really good at coding. Now, let me give you some tips for getting the most out of this. First, be specific with your
3:10:28
requests. Don't just say build an app. say, "Build a to-do app with dark mode
3:10:33
and the ability to set due dates." The more specific you are, the better the output. Second, don't be afraid to
3:10:40
iterate. If you don't like something, just ask it to change it. Make it more colorful. Add animation. Make it look
3:10:47
more professional. It's designed to work with you, not just dump code and disappear. Third, save your work. When
3:10:53
it builds something you like, make sure you know where the files are saved. Usually, it's in your current directory.
3:10:59
And fourth, if it breaks, don't panic. Just restart and try again. These tools are still new. Bugs happen, but when
3:11:05
they work, they're magic. Now, I want to talk about the bigger picture here, because this isn't just about free coding tools. This is about what's
3:11:11
happening in the AI space right now. Google is making a serious play to compete with OpenAI and Anthropic.
3:11:18
They're giving away powerful tools for free, building up user loyalty, getting people used to their ecosystem, and
3:11:24
frankly, it's working. This Gemini CLI tool is better than some paid alternatives I've used. If you're a
3:11:30
business owner, this should get your attention because AI automation is happening whether you're ready or not.
3:11:35
The companies that figure this out first are going to have a massive advantage. They'll be able to build faster, iterate
3:11:40
quicker, and do it all for less money. The companies that ignore this, they're going to get left behind. This is why I
3:11:46
spend so much time testing these new tools, not because I love technology, but because I want to find the ones that
3:11:52
actually move the needle for businesses. And this Gemini CLI, this moves the needle. Think about all the small tasks
3:11:58
you pay developers for. Quick fixes, simple apps, data processing scripts. You could potentially do all of that
3:12:04
yourself now for free. Or if you have developers on your team, they just became way more productive. They can
3:12:09
focus on the complex stuff while the AI handles the routine work. Either way, you win. Now, let me address something
3:12:15
I'm sure some of you are thinking. Julian, this sounds too good to be true. What's the catch? The catch is that it's
3:12:21
new. There are bugs. Sometimes it's slow. and Google could change the terms at any time, but right now today is free
3:12:27
and it works, so why not take advantage of it? The worst thing that happens is you learn something new. The best thing
3:12:32
that happens is you build something that makes you money. I'd take those odds any day. Let me tell you about someone I
3:12:37
know who's already using AI coding tools to build a business. He's not a developer, never learned to code, but
3:12:43
he's using tools like this to build simple web apps for local businesses, invoice generators, appointment
3:12:49
schedulers, simple e-commerce sites, nothing complicated, but stuff that local businesses actually need. He
3:12:56
charges $500 to $2,000 per project, and he can build most of them in a day or two with AI help. Do the math on that.
3:13:03
Even if he only does two projects per month, that's $2,000 to $8,000 in extra income. Not bad for someone who doesn't
3:13:10
know how to code. This is the opportunity in front of you right now. The barrier to entry for building
3:13:15
software has never been lower. You don't need a computer science degree. You don't need years of experience. You just
3:13:20
need to be willing to experiment and learn. And tools like this Gemini CLI make it easier than ever. Now, I want to
3:13:27
show you one more example before we wrap up, cuz this one really shows the power of what we're dealing with. I asked it
3:13:32
to create a web app that displays GitHub issues on a wall monitor, like something you'd see in a tech company's office.
3:13:39
This is a pretty complex request. It needs to connect to GitHub's API, pull live data, display it in a nice format,
3:13:47
update automatically. Normally, this would be a multi-day project for a developer. This thing built it in about 20 minutes. It created the HTML
3:13:53
structure, added the CSS styling, wrote the JavaScript to connect to GitHub, set up automatic updates, and made it full
3:14:00
screen responsive. When I opened it in my browser, I had a live dashboard showing all the issues from the project
3:14:05
with real-time updates. It looked like something a professional development team would build. That's when it really
3:14:11
hit me. This isn't just a helpful tool. This is a fundamental shift in how software gets built. We're moving from a
3:14:16
world where you need technical expertise to build things to a world where you just need good ideas and the ability to
3:14:21
communicate with AI. That's huge. And it's happening right now. Not in 5 years, not in 10 years, right now. The
3:14:27
question is, are you going to take advantage of it or are you going to let this opportunity pass you by? Because
3:14:32
here's the thing, early adopters always win with new technology. The people who jumped on social media first built the
3:14:39
biggest followings. The people who started e-commerce stores first made the most money. And the people who figure out AI automation first are going to
3:14:45
dominate their industries. This Gemini CLI tool is just one piece of that puzzle, but it's a pretty important
3:14:51
piece. So, here's what I want you to do. Go install this tool. Play around with it. Build something simple. See what it
3:14:57
can do. Don't worry about being perfect. Don't worry about building the next Facebook. Just experiment. Ask it to
3:15:03
build a simple calculator or a basic website or a tool that solves a problem you have. See how it works. Get a feel
3:15:10
for what's possible. Because once you see what this thing can do, you'll start seeing opportunities everywhere.
3:15:16
Problems that need solving, tools that need building, processes that need automating, and now you'll have the
3:15:21
ability to actually do something about it. That's the real power here. Not just the tool itself, but the mindset shift
3:15:26
that comes with it. From I can't build that to let me see what I can build. That shift alone is worth more than any
3:15:32
paid course or certification. All right, let's wrap this up. We covered a lot today. We talked about what Gemini CLI
3:15:38
is, how to set it up, what it can build, how it compares to other tools, and why this matters for your business. The
3:15:45
bottom line is this. Google just gave you a free AI developer. Use it, build something, break something, fix
3:15:51
something, learn something. The companies and individuals who embrace AI automation now are going to have a
3:15:57
massive advantage in the coming years. Don't be the person who looks back and wishes they had started sooner. If you

bigger. Thanks for watching. Julian Goldie reads every comment, so let me know what you build with this tool, and I'll see you in the next one. Today, I'm
3:17:00
going to show you the ultimate AI coding battle that everyone's talking about. Four AI giants are about to fight for
3:17:06
the coding crown. I tested them on seven crazy hard challenges that will blow your mind. You won't believe which AI
3:17:13
destroyed the competition. This is the test that reveals the truth about AI coding in 2025. Get ready because the
3:17:20
results are shocking. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of
3:17:25
Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get
3:17:30
more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. So,
3:17:35
here's what happened. I decided to run the ultimate test. Four of the most powerful AI models on the planet, all
3:17:42
fighting for one thing. The title of best AI coder or we've got Quen 3-235B-
3:17:48
A22B-2507. This is Alibaba's brand new monster just
3:17:54
dropped and it's already making waves. This thing is their latest coding powerhouse that's designed to compete
3:18:01
with the best. Then we have Claude for Opus Anthropic coding beast. They claim
3:18:06
it's the world's best coding model. It can code for 7 hours straight without stopping. And that's like having a
3:18:12
developer who never gets tired. Next up is Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google's latest and
3:18:17
greatest. This model is supposed to be revolutionary. Google says it can handle any coding challenge you throw at it.
3:18:24
And finally, Gro 4. This is the wild card. It's got that X factor that might surprise everyone. Here's the thing,
3:18:29
though. Everyone talks about which AI is best, but nobody runs real tests. They just look at benchmarks, but benchmarks
3:18:36
don't tell the whole story. You need real world challenges. So, I created seven brutal tests. These aren't simple
3:18:44
coding tasks. These are the kind of projects that separate the winners from the losers. Let me tell you about test
3:18:50
number one. HTML game with falling objects clicker. Here's the exact prompt I gave each AI. Build a simple HTML and
3:18:58
JavaScript game where objects fall from the top of the screen and the player has to click them before they hit the
3:19:03
ground. The game should include a start screen, score tracking, increasing difficulty over time, and work well on
3:19:09
both desktop and mobile. I asked each AI to build a complete game, not just some basic code, a real game with all these
3:19:16
features. This is where things got interesting. Gemini came out swinging, super fast response. The game actually
3:19:22
worked. You could play it right away. No bugs, no crashes, just pure gaming goodness. Quen 3 COD was next. Built
3:19:30
almost the same game. Pretty solid stuff. The mechanics worked great. Grock 4 followed with similar output. Nothing
3:19:36
groundbreaking, but it did the job. But here's the twist. Claude 4 Opus was last
3:19:41
to finish, but when I saw the UI, my jaw dropped. It was completely different from the others. Better design, cleaner
3:19:48
interface, more professional looking. So, round one goes to Gemini for speed and functionality. But Claude gets style
3:19:54
points. Test number two was brutal, a eye it eye tool landing page. The prompt
3:19:59
was, "Create a clean, modern landing page using only HTML and CSS for a fictional AI tool called Prompt Pilot.
3:20:06
It should include a catchy headline, sub headline, hero, image placeholder, a section with three features using icons,
3:20:13
a testimonial carousel, and a bold animated call to action button. I wanted a complete landing page for this fake AI
3:20:20
tool. Had to be modern, clean with all these specific elements. Gemini strikes
3:20:25
again, first to finish. The landing page looks amazing. and great font combinations, professional design. This
3:20:31
thing could fool anyone into thinking it was a real product. Quen came next, but the page was super plain. The text color
3:20:37
was so light you could barely see it. Major fail on the user experience front. Gro 4 delivered something basic, not
3:20:43
impressive, looked like a landing page from 2015. Claude 4 Opus came last again, but wow,
3:20:49
the UI was gorgeous. Perfect color choices, professional layout. If I was running a real AI company, I'd use this
3:20:55
design. Here's what I'm seeing. Gemini is fast and functional. Claude is slow but beautiful. Quen 3-235B-
3:21:03
A22B-2507 is hit or miss. Grock is basic. Test
3:21:08
three changed everything. Multiplayer tic-tac-toe in the browser. Here's the prompt I used. Build a two-player
3:21:14
tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that works in real time via websockets or a similar method. It
3:21:20
should allow two users to play from different browsers with automatic wind detection and a restart option. This
3:21:27
wasn't just any tic-tac-toe game. This had to work in real time. Two players in different browsers, websocket
3:21:33
connections, wind detection, restart options. This is advanced stuff. Plot
3:21:38
twist. Quen 3-235B- A 22B-2507
3:21:44
finish first. And the game actually worked. Nice UI, smooth gameplay, everything functioned perfectly. Claude
3:21:51
came second, good UI, working game, solid performance. Grock 4 was supposed to deliver a game, but when I checked,
3:21:57
there was no game. Complete failure. Gemini came last with a working game, but the UI looked terrible. Functional,
3:22:04
but ugly. This is where Quen 3-235B- A22B-2507
3:22:09
showed its true power. When it comes to complex interactive applications, it's a beast. Test four was the browserbased
3:22:16
markdown editor. The prompt make a browserbased markdown editor using HTML,
3:22:22
CSS, and JavaScript. The page should have a split screen layout with a markdown input on the left and a live
3:22:28
preview on the right. Include buttons for bold, itallic, and links, and allow the user to export the content as a MD
3:22:34
file. Split screen layout, live preview, export functionality. This is developer
3:22:39
tool territory. Quen finish first. But here's the problem. When I tried to preview anything, it threw errors. I
3:22:46
tried to fix it, but the errors kept coming. Total disaster. Gemini came next with a working Markdown editor. Clean,
3:22:52
functional, did exactly what it was supposed to do. Grock and Claude both built editors. But when you try to pace
3:22:58
basic HTML, neither would preview it properly. Both failed the real world test. So Gemini takes this round for
3:23:04
actually delivering something that works. Here's where things get crazy. Test five was portfolio website
3:23:10
generator. My prompt was build a simple web tool where a user can enter their name, skills, and project descriptions.
3:23:16
And when they click a generate button, it creates a styled onepage portfolio website, include an option to download
3:23:22
the generated HTML file. I wanted a tool where users could enter their info, click generate, and boom, a complete
3:23:29
portfolio website appears, plus the ability to download the HTML file. Jim and I finished first with a nice UI, but
3:23:37
it had a fatal flaw. It didn't respond to user input. Beautiful, but broken.
3:23:42
Quen had errors again. Starting to see a pattern here. Claude delivered something special. Good UI, working buttons,
3:23:48
responsive design. Actually did the job it was supposed to do. Grock had the same functionality as Claude, but the UI
3:23:54
looked basic. Still worked though. Claude wins this round for delivering both form and function. Test six blew my
3:24:00
mind. Tower defense game. Here's the prompt. Create a simple 2D tower defense game using HTML 5 canvas and JavaScript
3:24:08
where enemies follow a path and the player places towers to stop them. Include waves of increasing difficulty,
3:24:15
basic tower upgrades, and a game over screen. This isn't just a game. This is
3:24:20
a complete 2D tower defense system. Enemies following paths, towers that shoot, waves of increasing difficulty,
3:24:27
tower upgrades, game over screens. This is serious game development. Quen
3:24:32
finished first, but I couldn't figure out how to play the game. The UI was confusing. The mechanics weren't clear. It technically worked, but was unusable.
3:24:39
Then Gemini delivered something incredible. This felt like a real game. Professional fonts, smooth mechanics,
3:24:45
perfect UI. It was like playing a game from the app store. Absolutely insane for just one prompt. Gro's game didn't
3:24:51
work properly. Major disappointment. Claude did the job, but it could use improvement. Functional, but not
3:24:57
impressive. Gemini completely destroyed the competition here. No contest. Test seven was the ultimate challenge. First
3:25:03
person maze escape 3D game. The final prompt. Create a basic firstperson 3D
3:25:09
maze escape game in the browser using 3JS. The player should be able to move through a 3D maze using keyboard
3:25:15
controls WD. Find a key and unlock an exit door to win. I wanted a full 3D
3:25:21
maze game using 3JS. First person perspective keyboard controls with WD.
3:25:27
Find a key, unlock an exit door. win the game. This is professional game development territory. Gemini was
3:25:34
incredible. Created a full 3D maze that actually worked. You could move around, find the key, escape through the door.
3:25:40
It felt like playing a real video game. Quen showed just a brown background. No interaction. Complete failure. Claude
3:25:46
impressed me. Built a working 3D maze. You could navigate through it, find objectives, escape to win. Really solid
3:25:53
implementation. Grock just showed a white background. Another complete failure. Gemini wins again with the most
3:25:59
impressive 3D game. So, let's talk about what this all means. After running seven brutal tests, here's what I discovered.
3:26:06
Gemini 2.5 Pro is the speed demon. Fast responses, great UI design. When it
3:26:12
works, it really works. Especially impressive with games and visual applications. Claude for Opus is the
3:26:19
perfectionist. takes longer to respond but delivers higher quality code, better UI designs, more professional looking
3:26:26
results. When you need something that looks good and works well, Claude delivers. Quen 3-235B-
3:26:33
A22B-2507 is the wild card. Sometimes it's brilliant. The multiplayer tic-tac-toe
3:26:40
was amazing, but sometimes it fails completely. Inconsistent, but has moments of genius. Grock 4 is the
3:26:45
underdog. Basic, but functional most of the time. Not exciting, but gets the job done for simple projects. Here's the
3:26:52
thing, though. The winner depends on what you need. If you want speed and impressive visual results, Gemini is
3:26:58
your choice. It's perfect for prototypes and demos that need to wow people. If you want professional quality code that
3:27:05
looks good and works reliably, Claude for Opus is the winner. Yes, it's slower, but the results are worth
3:27:11
waiting for. If you're feeling adventurous and want to try something with huge potential, Quen 3-235B-
3:27:18
A22B-2507 might surprise you. Just be prepared for some inconsistency. And if you need
3:27:24
something basic that just works, Grock 4 will do the job. But here's the real secret. The best coders don't rely on
3:27:31
just one AI. They use multiple models for different tasks. Use Gemini for
3:27:36
rapid prototyping and visual applications. Use Claude for production code that needs to be professional. Use
3:27:41
Quen 3-235B- A22B-2507 when you want to experiment with
3:27:46
cuttingedge capabilities. This is exactly the kind of strategy we teach inside the AI profit boardroom. We have
3:27:52
over 1,000 members who are scaling their businesses and saving hundreds of hours with AI automation. They're learning
3:27:58
which AI tools work best for specific tasks. Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below
3:28:05
and let me know which AI you think performed the best. Some AIs are better at content creation, others excel at
3:28:11
technical analysis. Some are perfect for client communication. The same principle applies to coding. Master multiple tools
3:28:17
and you'll outperform someone using just one AI, no matter how powerful that single AI is. If you want to learn more
3:28:24
about building systems like this in your business, we offer free SEO strategy sessions. Link in the comments and
3:28:30
description will show you exactly how we use AI to scale our agency and how you
3:28:35
can do the same. Here's the bottom line from this coding battle. Each AI has strengths and weaknesses. Gemini
3:28:41
impressed with speed and visual results. Claude delivered professional quality. Quen 3-235B-
3:28:48
A22B-2507 showed innovative potential. Groke provided reliable basics. But the real
3:28:54
winner is anyone who learns to use all these tools strategically. That's what we're teaching inside the AI success
3:29:00
lab. real strategies, real results, real community of people who are building real businesses with these tools. The
3:29:06
link is in the comments and description. Join us and let's build the future together. Thanks for watching. Make sure
3:29:11
to subscribe for more AI battles and comparisons. Comment below with which AI you think won this coding challenge and
3:29:17
I'll see you in the next video. Today we have the brand new update from Google
3:29:23
which allows you to build apps ridiculously easy. You don't even need a brain to be able to use this bad boy.
3:29:28
I'll show you exactly how it works, but essentially, you can see here I've got this photo editing app that I literally just built in one click. It's incredibly
3:29:36
easy and this is all for free, right? Using AI Studio. Now, the amazing thing about this is it also uses AI inside the
3:29:43
apps that you build. So, you can see, for example, here we're using Google's Nano Banana image editing app, right?
3:29:50
So, we're not just creating images, we're actually editing them using this process. So you basically create like your own version of Photoshop almost
3:29:57
using the process that I'm about to show you today. It is absolutely wild what you can do here. And I'm also going to
3:30:03
give you 50 different prompts you can use along with this side by side so that you can start using this too. Now if you
3:30:11
want to see exactly how it works, let me show you how to do this. But first of all, I want to show you that it does actually work, right? So, for example,
3:30:18
if we duplicate this and we'll just refresh the page like and when we go to AI studio like you can see here and then
3:30:25
we've got the code assistance. So, this is where we can actually build out the code here if we want to add new features for example add a reset button that sort
3:30:32
of stuff and then over here we can insert our image. So, if we click on here, then we're going to upload the
3:30:37
thumbnail from today, for example. Then we're going to say, okay, make the background yellow, right? And you can
3:30:42
use this as a free editing app using Nano Bananas API. And then we're going to scroll down here and we've got the
3:30:49
original image. So, this is taking the image from the image that I've uploaded
3:30:54
here. And then you can see full screen. We've got the example here. By the way, if you want to zoom in, zoom out, you
3:31:00
press command and plus or command and minus. If you want to reset, press command zero. And then from here, you
3:31:06
can start using this to edit your photos. Right? So, you see here we've got the original image. They use Nano
3:31:12
Banana, Google's Nano Banana API. I haven't paid for this. Completely free to build out this app that actually
3:31:17
works. It's insane. Now, if you want to learn exactly how to use this stuff, we've actually got tons of training like
3:31:23
you see inside the AI Money Lab link in the comments description. And then from here, you can see the video notes. And
3:31:28
we also have some other automations you can actually do where it's one-click sort of image editing and image creation
3:31:34
along with 50 different image generation ideas with prompts that you can use to generate this stuff right. So for
3:31:40
example here API only came out when like last week right about seven or eight
3:31:46
days ago. So to have this incorporated directly into AI studio it is completely
3:31:51
new. This is a novel thing. This has only just come across right. So for example here you can type in your prompt
3:31:57
here. So you're going to go to a studio.google.com. Then you're going to go to build on the left hand side here. There is a chat
3:32:03
feature here. It's not as good for building stuff, right? You can use land banana in there, but again, not as good
3:32:08
as going to build down here and then you could type in this or use whatever prompt you want from the AI money lab.
3:32:15
You could also take, for example, these app ideas. So you could copy them. Then
3:32:20
you could go to chat GBT, right? And you can say, "Okay, based on what you know
3:32:27
about me, give me some app ideas like these that would be really good for me
3:32:35
personally." And the only person in the world that's actually going to know that stuff is like your mom and chat GBT, but
3:32:40
your mom doesn't build apps probably. So your chat GBT can and that's what we're
3:32:45
using to come up with these ideas. So for example, like a AI blog post generator, backlink visualizer, search
3:32:50
me generator, etc. Right. And it's really simple and easy to do. Now, once you've done that, you can go into AR
3:32:56
Studio in the build section. Hit enter like so. Run the prompt. Boom. Shakalaka. You're ready to go. Now, if
3:33:03
we go back to that app that we actually built a second ago, and whilst this is building out, we can wait for that in the background. Over here, we've got the
3:33:09
new app that we're building. And what you can actually do is you can download that app, right? So, some people were
3:33:15
asking me the other day like, how do you export this stuff? you can export it like and if you do that like you see
3:33:21
over here you've actually got the app ready to go. So if we click on that we've got all the files directly here.
3:33:27
Now I'm not 100% sure if this is going to work. One thing we could try is we
3:33:33
can open that up. But the other thing we could do here is if we want to host it you can just go to netlefi.com. So you
3:33:39
can go to netlefi.com you can add a new project import an existing project. Try netify drop. Grab that folder like plug
3:33:47
that bad boy into Netlify. Right. So, grab that. Then we're going
3:33:53
to drag it over to Netify like so. And that should upload. All right. So, we
3:33:58
can upload and host our files on a subdomain like you can see right here. And it doesn't cost anything to host it
3:34:03
on a subdomain. But then if you actually want to test out or try, etc., then you would host that on a real domain later.
3:34:10
The other thing you could do is just tell AI studio to put it into format that you can host. If you need more help
3:34:17
on that, just join the AI profit board and web app. Now, what we're doing here is we are building out the app. So, this
3:34:23
is a meme app that we've plugged into Gemini to start building this out. That's creating the preview. Boom. It
3:34:30
works straight away, right? Then from here, we can upload our cat photo. We can add the text bottom left, etc. And
3:34:36
the preview, right? So, if we wanted, let's start off with a picture of a cat, right? So, we're going to go into Google
3:34:43
here. See what we got. Let's have a look at the images. See what we wanted to create. All right.
3:34:51
So, for example, like this. Let's say we wanted to create that. So, what we can do over here is go to Google Gemini.
3:34:57
Then, we're going to flick on tools, and then we're going to create images. Again, this is free. I'm just going to show you how you could use this stuff.
3:35:04
You don't have to create cat memes, but obviously you would make the world a better place if you did. And then from
3:35:09
here, we can say, okay, with a birthday cake and one candle
3:35:17
looking grumpy. All right. Now, if you actually want to see how I like to use this stuff in a
3:35:22
real life example, just join the AR profit boardroom inside there. Essentially, we have this community,
3:35:29
1,200 builders who are actually building stuff and creating stuff that's actually going to grow their business, right? Obviously, cat me generators. Not the
3:35:36
best business use case, but if you want to learn how to use this stuff properly to really make money, scale your business, and save a lot of time, then
3:35:42
join the AI profit border link in the comments description. So, from here, we've got the Grumpy Gat. We're going to
3:35:48
download that. All right. So, we've downloaded that image. Then, we're going to go over here and we'll just check if this works. It might not work, but let's
3:35:54
test out. So, the image works straight away, which is great. Let's see if we can recreate this. So, I just wanted to eat cake. Boom. There we go. So, we got
3:36:01
the top text and then Hman lit it on fire. And we could delete that and make
3:36:07
that nicer. And then boom. Look at that. We've actually created a nicer meme than the original to be honest using AI.
3:36:14
Right. So, if we scroll down here, this is the original image. This one is better. It's way better. I'm creating
3:36:20
better memes than most of the internet, let's be honest. And then you can download that meme. You can open it up
3:36:25
and all of a sudden, mate, you just created yourself a free app using AI in the space of one minute that creates
3:36:31
better memes than the original. Essentially, you can see the power of this and how easy it is to start building out this stuff. What we got
3:36:37
here, Brook, shout out from New Zealand. That's what we're talking about. Shout out to New Zealand. I don't know if you
3:36:43
ever used to watch it, but Flight of the Concords. Great series. Great series from the New Zealand. I actually have a
3:36:49
mate who lives on my floor at the place I stay and he's from New Zealand as
3:36:54
well. Great people. Great people. Let me know where else we've got people streaming from. Be interesting to see
3:37:00
who we've got worldwide. Let me know in the comments. So, essentially, you can see how we can build out these cat meme
3:37:08
generators or app editors. We can create image creators like we've just done here or image editors like we did over here.
3:37:15
And you can do this in one single click. It doesn't cost you anything. You don't need to be able to code. Like how crazy
3:37:21
is that? It It blows my mind. Now also you can edit these apps. So we could say, for example, add save image. And
3:37:27
what you actually see here on the left hand side inside the coding section is that it recommends different features
3:37:32
that you can use directly for your app, right? So, not only do you not have to code, not only do you get this for free,
3:37:38
not only going to edit images and do it better than the originals, but also you can add new features and you don't even
3:37:43
have to think about what features you need to add because it's going to come up with those directly inside the chat here. So, for example, here we could add
3:37:49
a reset button. We could plug that prompt in. It comes up with the prop for us. We don't need to touch it. And then it's using Gemini 2.5 Pro to develop
3:37:57
that app and add the new UI element that's going to include the reset button. Pretty amazing, too. And you can
3:38:05
also do this side by side. So you can code each of these side by side as you go along. That's really simple as well.
3:38:10
We could add a font size slider here as well and then just code two things at the same time. So we've got the cat meme
3:38:16
generator with a new font editing feature. And then also inside the AI
3:38:21
studio over here, we have the addin functionality for the reset feature. Boom. All right. Now, if you like Nano
3:38:28
Banana, you get this next one as well. And so we actually have an automation that creates like images and videos in
3:38:35
one click too. So as an example of that, let me pull this up. You can actually get the JSON for free inside the AI
3:38:41
money lab. So you can just grab the free JSON files here that you can import into NA10. But if you go over to NA10 over
3:38:47
here and then we're going to open up a new workflow. There we go. Let's go to my workflows over here. And once that is
3:38:54
loaded, like you can see over here, we've got for example like a nano image
3:38:59
generator. Or for example, we have a ad generator using nano as well. And you can download
3:39:06
these for free inside the AI money lab. So for example, here we can test this
3:39:12
one out. Let's have a look at this. So this is an image to video generator. Let's take a look at this bad boy. So
3:39:20
that's one example of what you can do. And then let's keep scrolling down here.
3:39:26
This one is one of my favorites actually. Let's go here. So, with this
3:39:31
one, what you can actually do is you can upload an image and then what it's going to do is create a video ad based on that
3:39:40
image, right? So, you can see here it takes a brand asset input, plugs it through Google Drive, you get three
3:39:45
different agents to create it, it's going to create a video, then it's going to pump out the video and download it
3:39:50
over here. So, if you want to see an example of that previously, right? So, if we go to executions, you can see previous examples here. And if we scroll
3:39:58
down, let's see what we got. For example, like this. We'll pull this up.
3:40:03
And you can see this is a video generated from an image using this workflow as well. Nano Banana is
3:40:10
actually free for the weekend. I know for some people the weekend is still ending right now when I'm doing this
3:40:15
live stream at the time of this recording. So, you can still jump on this. But you can see here, for example, we created this kind of advert style
3:40:23
trailer using the AI avatar. So this is the AI avatar and he's using the product over here using this process via NA10.
3:40:31
So what you do essentially is when you're running it, you're going to run it through here, plug it into the brand
3:40:39
strategy agent, the creative director is going to edit it, the production specialist is going to edit it, and then
3:40:45
it's going to run through this workflow like and then essentially what you end up with is an image like you can see
3:40:50
over here. I used to struggle with my skin. And that includes audio and a voiceover
3:40:56
as well. Pretty cool. Here's another one. Let's pull this one up. So, this is
3:41:01
another avatar video that we generated using this automation. Then, if we play this, she's actually
3:41:07
speaking right now. Obviously, I'm not going to play that on the live stream cuz the sound won't be good. But you can see here how you can create these sort
3:41:13
of mini adverts using a combination of nano banana and then running it through
3:41:20
this workflow to create a video as well. Again, if you want the free automation for this, it's inside the AI profit
3:41:26
board along with all of these prompts. This all this all free stuff, right? The final thing that you could do as well is
3:41:32
you could just generate images with one click inside MA102. Let me show you an example of that. So, if we pull up might
3:41:39
be this one. Let's have a look. So if we go inside here and we'll say okay cat
3:41:45
eating a banana. Basically what this going to do is use Google Gemini chat model which is nano banana and then
3:41:52
generate an image and convert and download it over here. Right? You can see how the AI agent is coming up with a
3:41:57
prompt that's going to run it through this workflow. We're going to download that over here and then it's converting
3:42:04
the file. And then if we go over here, we've got the image of the cat eating the banana.
3:42:11
Really simple and easy to generate using this workflow. And you can download that as well and import it into NA10, like
3:42:17
you can see down here. So it's pretty amazing what you could do with Gemini. I think honestly it's probably the best
3:42:23
API in the world right now to code with especially since Nano Banana just came out. It's what we're using pretty much
3:42:30
for everything coding related just cuz Gemini is just so consistent and you can
3:42:35
use all of these processes to build like your own coding agent using Google directly.
3:42:42
And then you can see here as well inside the chat you can also generate images for free. So if you select Nana the
3:42:48
banana inside a studio.google.com google.com for example, say generate an image of a banana wearing a costume and
3:42:55
then over here it generates the image like so. Really cool stuff. The other
3:43:01
cool thing here is if we go back to the start, you can actually see what other people are creating as well. So you've
3:43:06
got a list of your apps that you've built. For example, the cam generator. These apps are saved. So we can always come back to them if we have recent
3:43:13
changes that we want to make. We can go to showcase as well. Now, so also some people will use Firebase for this stuff
3:43:19
too, but also you can share the app. So if you click on share over here, this will generate a URL that you can share
3:43:26
with people. And if you hit publish like so, that's now sharable, published
3:43:32
everyone on the web. And so now if we click on this, you can see that we can
3:43:37
share that app with other people. I will put it inside the video notes from today
3:43:42
inside the AI money lab. So if you want to get that, you can. So that's sharable and you can use it for free. And then
3:43:49
also what we can do over here is if we close that, we can share the photo editor too. So I'm going to hit save.
3:43:56
And you can see it's now got the reset button that we coded into the app, which
3:44:02
is great. We're just going to hit publish on that. And then we can make that sharable, too. So if you want a
3:44:08
free image editing app, you've got it like there. And then also one of the
3:44:15
things that I want to show you here is one thing that will be really useful for me that I use every single day pretty much is I can say YouTube thumbnail
3:44:23
generator escape dimensions low text attention grabbing clue based stuff
3:44:31
right we enter like so and again we can just build out that app as well and
3:44:36
that's actually something that a lot of people watching will probably use every single day. So we'll wait for that to load. So you can code it. You can see it
3:44:43
coding out here. It's building out the different project files on the right hand side with the chat on the left and
3:44:48
the progress here. So also runs through a checklist and it ticks everything up as it goes
3:44:54
along. You can see how quick and fast is. That's the other thing I like about Gemini is it's really quick and easy to
3:45:00
use, too. And then we should have the thumbnail generator like right. So, if
3:45:06
we enter the prompts for our thumbnail, I'm just going to say, okay, a robot looking
3:45:11
shot whilst typing on a laptop. I'll put rainbow colors,
3:45:18
something like that, just to see what it's capable of. Again, we've only built this in one click, but it's pretty cool.
3:45:25
And there we go. That's our YouTube thumbnail ready to go. You could say, okay, make it sleek and photo realistic.
3:45:34
There we go. So, that's your thumbnail ready to go. You could as well put Let's try this. Add text.
3:45:42
Google Gemini is insane. I don't know if it's going to add the text cuz I put inside the instructions. So, I'll do
3:45:48
that. Let's see if it does it. There we go. Look at that. That's pretty cool.
3:45:54
And then we can say okay make we'll change it from photo realistic
3:46:01
to neon futuristic style.
3:46:06
The other thing I like about building with nano banana is that when you're using the API, it just feels like a lot
3:46:13
more. It feels a lot faster, right? Whereas if you're generating even on the paid API, if you're generating images
3:46:20
using chat, it can take so long. Sometimes 2 minutes for one single image. Whereas in that space of time,
3:46:25
you can build out an app and generate an image using Google AI Studio and the Gemma Coder here. So there we go. We got
3:46:32
the image. That thumbnail will probably do quite well on YouTube to be honest. It's really easy and simple to create.
3:46:38
You know, if you had a team, you can now share this app with the team as well. So, let me make that public. We'll copy
3:46:44
that. We'll plug it into the image. Put the details here. Image creation app
3:46:50
or YouTube thumbnail creation app. All right. And
3:46:57
just to recap here, we've done a lot. What I've shown you today is how to build apps for free inside Google
3:47:04
Gemini. How to plug in any prompt you want and build whatever you want. We've also built a photo editor app, a cat me
3:47:11
generator app, an image editing app, and also a YouTube thumbnail creation app.
3:47:16
We got Marinella from Italy. Shout to you. And then inside here, I've shown
3:47:23
you how to download and host it. You can also deploy this directly inside here. So I think you would load that as a
3:47:28
Google cloud project and then you can host it on Google Cloud if you want to. I've also shown you how to automate
3:47:34
images using Nano Banana inside NA10. And I've given
3:47:39
you 50 different prompts of different apps you can build using
3:47:44
Gemini Coder along with the free templates and APIs so that you can build
3:47:50
your own apps directly inside N10 and create images or videos or ads directly
3:47:55
using that process as well. Ash says, "Hi, good to see you here." And yeah,
3:48:00
this is also a video tutorial showing you step by step exactly how to set up. So that's all inside the AI money lab.
3:48:06
If you want the video notes from today along with the links and everything else, then you go to the AI money lab,
3:48:12
go to classroom and then go to new automations and then you'll see new Gemini coder on the left hand side down
3:48:19
here. All right. And then you can see exactly everything you need to know. Now, inside this community as well, you
3:48:25
can connect with like 24,500 people. We're constantly dropping new trainings as you can see inside the community
3:48:31
here. Very active. And then also inside the classroom, you get access to all of these different trainings like you can
3:48:37
see along with some of my best NA10 automations completely for free. Look at that. including a browser use agent,
3:48:43
Google AI avatars, love warn NA10 automations, outbound calls agents, and a thousand different NA10 templates you
3:48:50
can just use directly here along within podcast AI agent as well. So that's all for free inside the money lab link in
3:48:56
the comments description. And then if you want to connect with me personally, the only place I really connect with
3:49:01
people personally is inside the AI profit boardroom. We also run five weekly live coaching calls per week. So
3:49:08
you can jump on those calls, ask any questions you have, that sort of thing. Inside the community here, we're running
3:49:14
giveaways. We have tons of different people posting and just helping each other and learning and growing from each other. You can see, for example, I
3:49:21
actually posted on here today, giving you some ideas on this stuff. Yeah, loads of cool stuff in there. And then
3:49:27
also inside the classroom here, if you don't know where to start, a lot of people are like, I'm a total beginner. I don't know where to start. Maybe I need
3:49:33
to be technical to join this. You don't need to be technical to join this. is built for anyone at any stage. Right? So
3:49:38
if you're a beginner, totally fine. You can just learn from the six week AI automation masterass and learn all the
3:49:44
fundamentals from scratch so that you have the right knowledge in place for building with AI however you want to.
3:49:50
However, if you have something specific in mind, for example, like maybe you want to create videos like I do with AI,
3:49:56
you can learn from the processes directly inside the AI profit boardroom social media video automation section
3:50:02
over here. Right. Additionally, we have inside the AI profit boardroom our
3:50:07
foundations and getting started and that sort of thing. And then we have our best NA10 templates and workflows. And these
3:50:14
are all categorized into different sections here. So you can see video based templates, scraping, social media,
3:50:20
audio based templates, email outbound and inbound emails,
3:50:26
website templates, AI personal assistance templates, and just a random
3:50:32
bunch of other stuff directly here as well. Additionally, what else we got? If you're an agency for us, we have a lot
3:50:38
of AI automation clients. So we basically teach the whole process inside this section here. So inside the agency
3:50:44
course step by step you can see exactly how to get more clients and then if we
3:50:49
scroll down we do have let's have a look here inside the YouTube section we have
3:50:55
a whole section on like how to grow your YouTube channel just like I have using this YouTube course here and it's okay
3:51:01
week one you do this week two you do that etc on world says I'm in shout out to you Ash says I will learn good for
3:51:09
you hope to see you inside the AI profit boardroom and just to recap Yeah, here's everything you get. So, hope to see you
3:51:14
in there. And if you're just like, Julian, I don't want to do any of this
3:51:20
stuff, but I do want to jump on a call with you or your team to figure out, okay, how can we implement this
3:51:26
business? Maybe you want to become a client of ours, right? You can book in a free AI automation session on this call.
3:51:32
Step by step, we're going to analyze where you spend your time, right? Where do you spend your time right now? so that we can figure out okay what's the
3:51:39
one biggest constraint that if you solved right now would five or 10x your business and save you a lot of time. So
3:51:45
that's step number one. Step number two is we figure out okay what is the best automation to build right now for your
3:51:52
business that's going to save you hundreds of hours and we do this all with you. And then the final step is if
3:51:58
you hire us to do this then on that call we're going to go off and implement this
3:52:03
for you. Now, typically power automation is about $1,500 or $2,000 per automation. But if you just like a busy
3:52:10
entrepreneur, you don't have time to implement this stuff yourself, you need it, then book in a call here and we can
3:52:16
just jump on that call with you and show you exactly what you'll need to automate and how much it's going to cost. All right, so appreciate you watching and
3:52:22
again, if you want the free stuff, join the AI money lab. Completely free. Doesn't cost a penny. And I will see you
3:52:28
on the next one. Cheers for watching. Bye-bye. GPT5 versus Claude 4.1, Opus
3:52:34
versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. Who wins? Today, I'm going to show you which AI actually wins when you put them head-to-head. I
3:52:41
tested GPT5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on the same exact tasks. The
3:52:48
results will shock you. One AI completely crashed three times in a row. Another one kept making the same mistakes over and over. But one AI
3:52:55
surprised me with something I never expected. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of
3:53:01
Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to
3:53:08
help you get the latest AI updates. Here's what happened when I put these three AI giants to the test. I gave them
3:53:14
all the exact same challenge. Build me five different games, same rules, same time limit, same everything. The
3:53:21
question everyone's asking is simple. Which AI is actually better? GPT5 just dropped. Claude Opus 4.1 is making waves
3:53:28
and Gemini 2.5 Pro claims to be the smartest yet. But here's the thing. Everyone talks about these AE is. Nobody
3:53:36
actually tests them properly. So I did what nobody else would do. I put them through real challenges, not simple
3:53:42
questions, not basic tasks, real work that matters. What I found will change how you think about AI forever. Let me
3:53:49
start with the first test. I asked all three A's to build a game called Pixel Ninja Dash. The goal was simple. Create
3:53:55
a single page app where you dash and jump across rooftops while slicing enemy robots. Sounds easy, right? Wrong.
3:54:03
Here's what happened. Gemini finished first. The UI looked good, but the game was so hard to play, I wanted to throw
3:54:10
my computer out the window. GPT5 came second. Again, nice UI, but just like
3:54:15
Gemini, way too hard to actually enjoy. Then Claude Opus 4.1 finished last. Uh,
3:54:21
but here's the twist. The game was actually fun to play. Easy controls, nice night city lights, cute background.
3:54:27
While the other two made games that looked good but felt terrible, Claude made something you'd actually want to play. This tells us something important.
3:54:34
Speed doesn't always win. Pretty doesn't always work. Sometimes the AI that takes longer makes something better. But wait,
3:54:40
it gets more interesting. Test two was Candy Match Blast. Match three candies score points. Beat the clock. Standard
3:54:47
match three game that everyone knows. Gemini finished first again, but there was an error. The game didn't work. So,
3:54:53
while I waited for Gemini to fix it, Claude finished. And holy cow, instead of regular candy graphics, Claude used
3:55:00
emojis, chocolates, candies, sweets. It looked completely different from what the others made. GPT5 finished next. The
3:55:08
design was like painted balls. Pretty and polished. It worked well. Finally, Gemini fixed its error and came last.
3:55:15
When it finally worked, I wasn't impressed. The design was boring compared to the others. Claude won this round. Not because it was fastest,
3:55:21
because it was creative. It fought outside the box. It made something unique while the others played it safe.
3:55:26
This is where most people get AI wrong. They think faster means better. They think first place means best. But what
3:55:33
actually matters is results. What matters is whether the thing you ask for
3:55:38
actually works the way you need it to. Test three was jungle run adventure. Run
3:55:44
and jump across jungle platforms. Collect bananas. Avoid traps. Infinite
3:55:49
terrain that gets faster as you play. Here's where things got messy. All three AIs failed on the first try. Every
3:55:56
single one had errors, so I gave them all a second chance. Claude finished first this time. The game design looked
3:56:01
good, but there were no bananas, no collectibles, just a monkey running. I gave it another chance. The second
3:56:07
version didn't work at all. Gemini came next. It worked most of the time, but sometimes the space bar didn't respond.
3:56:13
Sometimes you couldn't jump. And instead of bananas, it made yellow balls. I'm not kidding. Yellow balls instead of
3:56:18
bananas. GPT5 came last. The game crashed completely three times. It just
3:56:24
couldn't handle this challenge at all. This test showed me something crucial. When AIs fail, they fail differently.
3:56:30
Some fail fast and recover. Some fail slow but work eventually. Some just keep
3:56:35
failing no matter what you do. But here's what's really happening behind the scenes. Each AI has different
3:56:40
strengths, different ways of thinking about problems, different approaches to code. And here's where you need to pay
3:56:46
attention because the next test changed everything. Test four was Space Miner
3:56:52
3D. Fly a spaceship through asteroids. Collect crystals. Don't crash. Use 3.js
3:56:58
for 3D graphics. Gemini finished first. Nothing special. Standard game. GPT5
3:57:04
came second. Also nothing special. Same basic approach. But Claude came last. At
3:57:09
first it showed errors. I thought it failed again. But then I realized something. The game was actually working and it looked way better than the other
3:57:15
two. Despite the initial errors, Claude had built something more impressive. This taught me the biggest lesson of
3:57:20
all. Don't judge an AI by its first response. Don't judge it by how fast it works. Judge it by the final result. You
3:57:27
know what most business owners get wrong about AI? They pick the AI that gives them answers fastest. They want quick
3:57:33
results, fast responses, instant gratification. But that's like choosing a restaurant because they serve food
3:57:39
fast. Speed doesn't mean quality. Speed doesn't mean the food tastes good. Speed doesn't mean you'll be satisfied. The
3:57:46
same is true with AI. The best AI isn't always the fastest AI. Now, here's where you can transform your business with AI.
3:57:53
Most people use AI wrong. They ask simple questions. They want quick answers. They treat AI like a search
3:57:59
engine. That's like buying a Ferrari and only driving it to the grocery store. The real power of AI comes when you push
3:58:05
it. When you give it complex challenges, when you test its limits. And that's exactly what the AI success lab teaches
3:58:12
you. How to use AI the right way. How to get results that actually matter. How to save hundreds of hours and thousands of
3:58:18
dollars with the right AI strategies. Check the link in the comments and description. Over 14,000 members are
3:58:24
already inside learning the advanced techniques that most people never discover. But let me finish the story
3:58:30
first because test 5 was the real eye opener. Test 5 was lava escape runner.
3:58:35
Run across crumbling platforms while lava rises from below. Volcanic theme, fiery colors, intense but not
3:58:42
frustrating gameplay. Gemini finished first again, but guess what? Error again, so I gave it time to fix it.
3:58:49
Claude came second. The game worked. Sometimes the controls didn't respond perfectly, but it was playable. It was
3:58:55
fun. GPT5 came last, and this is where it completely fell apart. Error after
3:59:01
error after error, three times in a row. It just couldn't handle this challenge. So, what does all this mean? Which AI
3:59:07
actually wins? Here's the truth. There is no single winner. Each AI has different strengths. Gemini is fast but
3:59:13
makes more errors. GPT5 is polished but struggles with complex tasks. Claude is
3:59:19
creative and often builds better final products even if it takes longer. But here's what really matters for your business. You need to know which AI to
3:59:26
use for which task. For quick, simple tasks. Gemini might be your best bet. For polished standard work, GPT5 could
3:59:33
work well. For creative complex projects, Claude often surprises you with something better. Most people don't
3:59:38
know this. They pick one AI and stick with it. That's like using a hammer for every job. Sometimes you need a
3:59:44
screwdriver. Sometimes you need a saw. The businesses that are winning with AI right now understand this. They use
3:59:50
different AIs for different purposes. They know when to use which tool. And that's exactly what we teach inside the
3:59:56
AI success lab. Not just how to use one AI, but how to use all of them. How to pick the right tool for each job. How to
4:00:03
get results that your competitors can't match. You see how I show a checklist of 100 different tutorials that were given
4:00:09
away as freebies every day inside the school feed. That's just the beginning. You get all the video notes, all the
4:00:15
strategies, all the techniques that took me years to figure out. Plus, you join 14,000 other members who are all
4:00:22
learning and sharing the latest AI breakthroughs. When you're part of something bigger than yourself, you
4:00:27
learn faster, you grow faster, you get results faster. Here's what this really means for you. AI isn't just about
4:00:33
getting quick answers anymore. It's about building systems, creating processes, automating tasks that used to
4:00:39
take hours. The companies that figure this out first will dominate their markets. The ones that don't will be
4:00:44
left behind. I've seen it happen already. Businesses that used to spend thousands on content creation now do it
4:00:50
for pennies. Companies that used to hire expensive developers now build apps with AI. Entrepreneurs who used to struggle
4:00:57
with marketing now create campaigns that convert like crazy, but only if they know how to use AI properly. That's why
4:01:03
I created the AI Profit Boardroom. It's the best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of
4:01:10
hours with AI automation. We currently have 1,000 members who are all transforming their businesses with AI.
4:01:16
These aren't just people playing around with Chat GBT. These are serious entrepreneurs who are using AI to build
4:01:22
real wealth, real systems, real businesses that run themselves. Inside the boardroom, you get access to
4:01:29
strategies that most people will never discover. You get templates and systems that took years to develop. You get a
4:01:34
community of people who are all on the same mission as you. Here's the bottom line. AI is changing everything, but
4:01:41
most people are using it wrong. They're getting surface level results when they could be getting life-changing outcomes.
4:01:47
The difference is knowing what to do, knowing which AI to use when, knowing how to structure your prompts, knowing
4:01:53
how to build systems that actually work. And honestly, you can't figure this out by yourself. The landscape changes too
4:01:59
fast. New AIs launch every month. New features drop every week. New strategies
4:02:04
emerge every day. That's why you need a community. That's why you need training. That's why you need guidance from people who are already getting results. If you
4:02:11

4:02:45
challenges are you facing? The future belongs to the people who master AI first. The question is, will that be
4:02:51
you? Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't let your competitors get ahead while you're still trying to figure this out
4:02:57
on your own. Join the thousands of entrepreneurs who are already transforming their businesses with AI.

Get the training. Join the community. Build the systems. Your future self will thank you. See you in the next video.
4:03:10
New Google Gemini Coder is insane and it's free. Today I'm going to show you
4:03:15
Google's new secret weapon that can code entire games and apps for you in seconds. This thing just dropped and
4:03:22
nobody's talking about it yet. I'm about to blow your mind with what this can build. We're talking full tower defense
4:03:28
games, physics simulations, and digital art tools, all for free and all without writing a single line of code. This
4:03:35
changes everything. So, Google just dropped something massive, and I mean massive. They launched this new coding
4:03:40
feature inside Gemini that most people don't even know exists yet. And when I tested it, my jaw hit the floor. I'm
4:03:47
talking about Google Gemini Canvas. This isn't just another chatbot that spits out code. This thing actually builds
4:03:53
working apps and games right in front of your eyes. No coding skills needed, no complicated setup, just pure magic. Now,
4:03:59
here's what blew my mind. I asked it to build three different projects. A digital art canvas, a physics
4:04:05
simulation, and a tower defense game. All things that would normally take weeks to code. And this thing delivered
4:04:11
in minutes. But before I show you exactly what happened, let me explain what Google Gemini canvas actually is.
4:04:17
Because this is bigger than most people realize. Gemini canvas is Google's answer to everyone who said, "A I can't
4:04:23
code properly." is built right into their Gemini platform and it comes in three flavors for students for work and
4:04:29
for fun. The student version helps you learn. It creates custom quizzes from your study materials, visualizes code so
4:04:36
you can understand it better, and even refineses your drafts all automatically. The work version is where things get
4:04:42
serious. It helps you accelerate impact at your company, optimize operations,
4:04:47
and drive growth with real-time tools. We're talking interactive price sliders and custom proposals that close deals.
4:04:54
But the fun version, that's where the magic happens. This thing can generate 3D planets with unique details, create
4:04:59
sound memory games, build music synthesizers with full controls, and even solve complex pathfinding problems,
4:05:06
all with just simple text commands. Now, let me walk you through my real tests because what I discovered will change
4:05:12
how you think about coding forever. Test number one, I asked it to create a virtual synthesizer. I wanted knobs and
4:05:18
sliders for volume, pitch, reverb, and delay, the ability to compose short melodies directly, and options to record
4:05:25
and play back within minutes. I had the Gemini synthesizer with the tagline, craft your melodies with sound. This
4:05:32
wasn't some basic toy. This was a professional looking music tool with a full piano keyboard, control knobs for
4:05:38
volume, octave, reverb, and delay mix, even delay time controls. The interface was sleek, dark theme, responsive keys,
4:05:46
record play, and clear buttons had actually worked. This is the kind of tool musicians pay hundreds for, and
4:05:51
Gemini built it for free. Test number two, I asked for a digital art canvas, different brush types, color palettes,
4:05:57
layer support, pixel art capability, preset templates, export features. What I got blew my mind. A full digital art
4:06:06
studio that rivals Photoshop for basic tasks. Complete tool palette on the left, color picker, size sliders,
4:06:12
opacity controls, a pixel grid option for pixel art, professional layers panel on the right. But here's the crazy part.
4:06:18
It included preset templates, standard 1,920x 1080, portrait mode, square format, even
4:06:26
64x 64 pixel art mode, plus custom size inputs for any dimensions you want. This
4:06:31
looked like software you'd pay $50 a month for. Professional interface, clean design, all the features you'd expect.
4:06:37
Test number three, physics simulation. I wanted gravity effects on different objects. User controls for gravity
4:06:43
strength, object mass, initial velocity, real-time bouncing and falling. Gemini delivered an interactive gravity
4:06:49
simulation with crystal clear instructions, sliders for gravity strength, object mass, X and Y velocity,
4:06:55
and bounciness. Add object and clear all buttons. The 3D objects looked
4:07:00
realistic. Pink spheres that actually bounced according to physics laws. You could adjust gravity from moonlight to
4:07:07
Jupiterike. Change mass to see how heavy objects behave differently. Set initial velocity to launch objects across the
4:07:14
screen. The physics felt right. The controls were intuitive and it handled multiple objects interacting
4:07:19
realistically. Test number four. This is where things got absolutely insane. I asked for a tower defense game. Five tower types,
4:07:27
multiple enemy waves, currency system, increasing difficulty. What I got was neon nexus tower defense with full
4:07:33
cyberpunk theming, not some basic game. A professional quality tower defense with neon graphics and slick UI. Five
4:07:41
unique towers with distinct roles. Gatling gun for $100. Fast firing low
4:07:46
damage cannon for 250. Slow high area damage. Frost tower for 150. Slows
4:07:52
enemies in range. Missile silo for 400. Longrange seek strongest foe. Laser beamer for 600. Melts a single target.
4:08:00
The game map had a clear enemy path. Currency tracking, health system, wave counter, professional game UI that you'd
4:08:06
see in Steam games. The strategic depth was real cheap fast towers versus expensive heavy hitters. Area damage
4:08:13
versus single target, slowing effects versus direct damage. This had real game balance. And the visual style, pure
4:08:20
cyberpunk neon aesthetic. This looked like an indie game you'd buy for $10. All of these built-in minutes. No coding
4:08:27
knowledge required, no expensive software, just simple text prompts. But here's where this gets interesting for
4:08:33
your business. Because this isn't just about games and fun projects. Think about what this means for your company.
4:08:39
Need a custom calculator for your website? Gemini can build it. Want an interactive product demo? Done. Need a
4:08:46
data visualization tool? Easy. The applications are endless.
4:08:52
custom forms, interactive pricing tools, product configurators, lead magnets,
4:08:57
sales demos, training simulations, onboarding tools, all without hiring developers, all without learning to
4:09:03
code. All for free. Now, let me show you the three different versions and how to access them. First, the student version.
4:09:09
This is perfect if you're learning or teaching. Go to Gemini and click on for students. You'll see options like
4:09:15
personalized learning where you can upload study guides and it creates custom quizzes. There's visualize code
4:09:21
which breaks down complex programming concepts into simple visual explanations and refined drafts which helps improve
4:09:28
your writing and assignments. The work version is under for work. This is where businesses get serious value. Accelerate
4:09:35
impact helps you build tools that make immediate business impact. Optimize operations creates efficiency tools and
4:09:42
drive growth builds sales and marketing tools. But the fun version under for fun is where the creative magic happens. 3D
4:09:49
Planet Generator creates unique worlds. Sound Memory Game builds interactive games. Music synthesizer creates full
4:09:56
music production tools. And BFS Pathfinder solves complex routing problems. Here's what most people don't
4:10:02
understand. This isn't just about the tools Gemini provides. It's about what you can build yourself. See, each of
4:10:07
these examples shows you what's possible. But you can ask Gemini to build anything. Custom e-commerce tools,
4:10:13
booking systems, inventory management, customer service portals, marketing automation tools. The limit is your
4:10:20
imagination. Now, let me give you the inside secrets to getting the best results from Gemini Canvas. First, be
4:10:26
specific about what you want. Don't just say, "Build me a game." Say, "Build me a tower defense game with five tower
4:10:32
types, multiple enemy waves, and a currency system for upgrades." Second,
4:10:38
describe the user experience. How should it look? How should it feel? What should happen when users click buttons? Third,
4:10:45
mention key features you need. Export options, save functionality, different modes, customization options. Fourth,
4:10:52
ask for responsive design. Make sure it works on mobile and desktop. Fifth, request clean, modern styling. Gemini
4:10:59
can make things look professional if you ask, but here's the real secret. You can iterate and improve. If the first
4:11:06
version isn't perfect, tell Gemini what to change. Add features, fix bugs,
4:11:13
improve the design. It learns and adapts. This is like having a full development
4:11:19
team at your fingertips for free. Now, I know what you're thinking, Julian. This
4:11:25
sounds too good to be true. What's the catch? Honestly, there isn't one. Google is giving this away for free because
4:11:31
they want to compete with OpenAI and Claude. They're in an AI arms race, and we benefit. The only limitation is
4:11:37
complexity. Super advanced applications might need real developers, but for 80%
4:11:43
of what most businesses need, Gemini handles it perfectly. And here's what excites me most. This is just the
4:11:50
beginning. Google is updating Gemini constantly, adding new features, improving capabilities, making it
4:11:56
smarter. 6 months from now, this thing will be even more powerful. A year from now, it might replace entire development
4:12:02
teams for small to medium projects. But you can get ahead of the curve right now. While your competitors are still
4:12:08
hiring expensive developers and waiting months for projects, you can build and test ideas in minutes. This is your
4:12:14
competitive advantage. Use it now. Before I wrap up, let me give you the practical steps to start using this
4:12:20
today. Step one, go to gemini.google.com.
4:12:25
Sign in with your Google account. Step two, choose your version. Students, work, or fun. Each has
4:12:33
different tools and examples. Step three, start with the examples. Try the 3D planet generator. Test the music
4:12:39
synthesizer. Play with the tools Google provides. Step four, reverse engineer what you see. Look at how these tools
4:12:45
work, what features they have, how the interface is designed. Step five, start building your own projects. Begin
4:12:51
simple. A calculator, a quiz tool, a basic game. Then get more complex. Step six, iterate and improve. Don't expect
4:12:59
perfection on the first try. Refine your requests, add features, fix issues. Step
4:13:04
seven, deploy and test. Get real users to try your creations. Gather feedback,
4:13:09
make improvements. This process will teach you how to think like a prompt engineer, how to communicate with AI
4:13:15
effectively, how to build things without coding, and these skills are becoming more valuable every day. Look, I've been
4:13:21
in the SEO and digital marketing space for years. I've built a sevenfigure agency, trained over 50,000 students,
4:13:27
written bestselling books on SEO and agency marketing, and I can tell you with confidence, this changes
4:13:32
everything. The barriers to building digital products just disappeared. The cost of testing ideas dropped to zero.
4:13:39
The speed of innovation increased by 100 times. Smart entrepreneurs will use this to build businesses, create products,
4:13:46
test markets, generate revenue. While others are still trying to learn to code, you'll be building and shipping.
4:13:51

4:14:34
revolution is here, and tools like Google Gemini Canvas are leading the charge. The question isn't whether AI
4:14:40
will change your industry, it's whether you'll be ahead of the curve or left behind. Choose wisely. Gemini 2.5 Flash
4:14:47
preview, how to build anything and automate anything. So today I'm going to show you all of the best ways to use Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview, which is a new
4:14:55
update from Google. Just got announced a few hours ago to build and automate almost anything that you can imagine.
4:15:01
All right, so we're going to get straight into this. The first way that you can actually start using Gemini is if you go to gemini.google.com,
4:15:09
then you're going to select 2.5 Flash and that will use the latest model to build whatever you want. Right? So, for example, here if we go inside Gemini
4:15:15
now, and we're going to select canvas, and this will allow us to not just build with Flash, but also to build apps with
4:15:22
a live preview. So, let's go inside here. We'll use 2.5 Flash. We'll select canvas, and then we're going to say
4:15:27
something like, okay, create a drawing app for me. That's going to code it out.
4:15:33
And once it's ready, it will also give you a live preview. So, you can actually check this out as a live preview and
4:15:39
code out really fast. So you can see here we've got the simple drawing app and let's test it and make sure it
4:15:44
works. We can have a go and you can see that the drawing app works perfectly.
4:15:50
You can change the color over here and we're good to go on that. Not only this, but with Gemini 2.5 Flash is really fast
4:15:57
to build out. And additionally, you can actually host it on a subdomain. So if we click on share in the top right, then
4:16:02
it's going to create a link for us. If we click on that link, we've now got the sharable app ready to deploy and it's
4:16:09
ready to go as you can see. So, let's just test this out. There we go. Drawing
4:16:14
app built in. Literally one click, one prompt. Worked perfectly. Flash has got a lot better since its update today. It
4:16:22
seems to be faster, seems to be easy to use. And if you just want to code out stuff, I would recommend just going directly to gemini.google.com
4:16:29
simply because you can get the live preview and it's quite easy to deploy stuff as a one click to make. If you
4:16:34
want to for example get the code for this, you can go to
4:16:41
trial vout canvas and then it will give you the code directly inside the chat as well. Next up, one of the other ways
4:16:47
that you can start using this is inside AI studio and again this is a free way to get access to it. So you can go to
4:16:53
Gemini 2.5 flash preview in the top right under the settings. So go to 2.5 then flash preview and then inside here
4:16:59
you can start coding. Now inside here as well you can also do like native image generation check out other apps you can
4:17:07
easily get the access to the API as well from Gemini and then we can start coding. So for example if we take a
4:17:14
prompt that I've just built with we'll go to the history we created this endless runner game using 2.5 flash
4:17:22
preview and literally all we said was make me a captivating endless runner game. key instructions on the screen. P5 js no HTML I like pixelated dinosaurs
4:17:29
and interesting backgrounds coded that out perfectly pretty quickly as well and we were using the new thinking mode from
4:17:36
gemini 2.5 flash as well and then if we go over to p5 js editor.p5js.org
4:17:42
or if you want to check this out. Paste this in, hit play, test this out, and
4:17:47
there we go. Game is working perfectly, right? And again, you can just build this out for free in one prompt, one
4:17:54
shot. Works really well. Gives you a little score. Has some decent UI. You can improve the UI, but if you go back
4:17:59
and forth with it, you're going to get better results. You can see exactly how to do it. So, just to recap here, you can build and deploy apps using Gemini
4:18:06
2.5 Flash directly inside gemini.google.com. If you want to create code and then
4:18:12
preview it, so for example this p5 js game, then you would create the code directly inside AI Studio and then go
4:18:18
over to p5js.editor.org and plug that code in and start playing it. Right? So those are two different
4:18:25
ways that we can use this. Additionally, what we can also do is we can go over to something like client. And by the way,
4:18:32
if you're wondering, okay, how do you set this stuff up or where are all the links, etc. How do you get access to all this stuff? You can just get access to
4:18:37
the full SAP on building and automating with Gemini directly inside the AI success lab link in the comments
4:18:43
description. Basically shows you how to build anything and automate anything with Gemini 2.5. And everything that I'm showing you today has been broken down
4:18:49
into step-by-step tutorials and guides. So you can steal this stuff from me. All right, so let's go back into Visual
4:18:55
Studio Code over here. And then we're going to run a new task. And inside our extension client, we're going to go to
4:19:01
settings, open router, and we're going to select Gemini 2.5 flash preview from the options. Now, client have actually
4:19:08
officially confirmed the flash, the new model is directly inside here.
4:19:15
And you can switch between different APIs as well directly inside the chat here. You can also use Google Chi 2.5
4:19:22
flash preview thinking mode here as well. And then we can hit save on that. And from here, we can build whatever we
4:19:27
want. So for example, we say just something quick and basic to show you exactly what you can build. Let's say
4:19:33
something like okay build out a and
4:19:39
we'll take some examples from the AI profit boardroom link in the comments in description if you want to join this community with coaching et etc on AI but
4:19:46
we can say here okay create beautifully designed snow calculator SEO optimize
4:19:51
for the keyword actual content on the page and a relevant tool right we'll go inside there and then we'll also say
4:19:57
right make this pink gradient fun emoji plus make it
4:20:05
look sleek, modern, and beautiful. Plus add FAQs
4:20:11
like so. Then we can hit enter. Make sure that you've got the right API selected, hit enter, and that's going to
4:20:18
start coding out. What you can also do is inside root code, if you paste the same sort of prompt, you can go inside
4:20:23
here and you can click the AI button and that will actually improve the prompt for you if you want to get better prompts or just make your prompts more
4:20:30
detailed. But you see how it's basically instantly building this out, creating the code for us. And we really didn't
4:20:35
have to create much work there at all. Jose Pinto says, "Good one." And that's building this out. Now, we're going to
4:20:41
hit run command. We'll open that up. We've got the SEO snow day calculator built out. Now, being 100% honest, the
4:20:48
UI of this does not look very nice. So, what I would normally do is either I'm going to be very patient and go back and
4:20:54
forth with Gemini Flash for ages or I can switch now to Anthropic and then
4:21:00
inside Anthropic Claw 3.5 Sonet and then inside here we can say okay make the UI
4:21:06
more beautiful, sleek, modern, interesting. All right. And then Claude 3.7 Sonet is just a lot
4:21:14
better for improving the prompts and improving the UI on the actual code that
4:21:19
you build. All right. So, that's what I'd recommend. Now, we're going to close that because I've shown you how to build with client.
4:21:27
You've seen how to build with Gemini. You know how to build with AI Studio. What's next? What we can also do is we
4:21:33
can go over to NA10 and you can build out workflows with A10 using Flash as
4:21:39
well. So, if we go inside NA10.io, this is a really powerful tool for building out automations. So, for example,
4:21:46
like I've built out voice automation, Slack bots, all sorts of agents inside
4:21:52
N810. And if we go inside create workflow here, we'll just create a little basic example.
4:21:59
In fact, what I can do is yeah, create workflow. Then we can put this as a chat trigger
4:22:05
just to show you a really basic example what we can build. And then we're going to add an AI agent. Inside the AI agent
4:22:14
module, what you want to do is just add chat model. And you could either use like Google Gemini chat model and create
4:22:21
a new credential there. Or we can delete that. So let's close that. And then
4:22:28
inside here, we could select open router. Open router. We can add a credential
4:22:33
inside here. So let me show you how to get that. You're just going to go over to open router. Select keys.
4:22:39
Create API key. Type it in. Copy that. Go over to NA10 again. Paste in the API
4:22:48
key. Hit save. X off that. Select the model. And then you can use Gemini 2.5
4:22:54
flash preview 20. And also thinking mode. If you be an agent and it doesn't require much thinking, you just want
4:23:00
instant responses, then you should just use flash preview and you're good to go on that. So if we want to test this out,
4:23:08
I'm just going to put some system instructions inside the AI agent. So let's say you're a helpful assistant and
4:23:14
we'll say, okay, is 100 * 40. It's running the AI agent. As you can see,
4:23:20
because it's flash, it's really good for building out AI agents. And then if we open this up, it said here's how to
4:23:26
calculate 100* 40. Here's what you do. And then it's given us the answer right there. All right. So that's how you can
4:23:34
build AI agents as well. So, if you want to just steal that example from me, I'll actually download the JSON and then
4:23:39
inside the AI success lab link in the comments completely free. You can download that JSON from me and you can
4:23:45
grab the example agent and all your agents that you use, you can just switch to Flash if you want to as well just by
4:23:51
changing the chat model that branches off as you can see. So, just to recap
4:23:57
here, we've talked about Gemini and building apps directly in there. We've talked about AI Studio and how to code with that. We've talked about Visual
4:24:04
Studio Code and how to code with that. And we've also talked about how to build AI agents using NA10 as well. So you can
4:24:10
see the power of this and how easy it is to build out almost anything that you want using Gemini in this process.
4:24:17
Let's keep going now. So what we're going to do from here is we're going to start using something called Bolt DIY.
4:24:24
BoltDIY is like a offline version of Bolt where you can code with it directly
4:24:29
and you can also use Gemini Flash inside here. So, if you want to set this up quickly, pretty simple. SAP inside the
4:24:35
AI success lab, which is completely free for you to get access. And if we go
4:24:41
inside the instructions, we'll do a direct installation. Paste that in. Then we'll PMP install that.
4:24:48
And literally, all you're doing is just copying and paste in, right? It's pretty simple. And then we're just going to do
4:24:54
that. Now, if we need to pull in the latest model from Bolt, we can just grab
4:25:01
this, we can plug that into Claude and say how to set up. And if you have any
4:25:07
issues, like you see over here, we can just go back in here and say, okay, help with this.
4:25:13
And then we'll copy this. And what that's going to do is start running BoltDIY locally. So, we can build with
4:25:18
it. If we copy that local address, then we'll open that up in a new tab. Now you can see we can start coding with bolt
4:25:25
and if you select open router and then you can choose Gemini 2.5 Pro preview
4:25:30
here and just get access to 2.5 Pro preview to start building stuff out. Right now you just need an API key. So
4:25:38
you can get that from open router. Let's go to keys in the top right. Create API
4:25:43
key. It's good practice is just give it a name you can actually remember. And then we'll copy that code. Go back into
4:25:49
bolt. plug that in and say, "Okay, build a SEO calculator." Right? Something like
4:25:57
that. I'm just showing you basic examples for the video before anyone comments and saying, "This isn't that impressive," etc. And now that should
4:26:04
start coding out. Now, the only issue you're going to have with this is sometimes this runs a little bit slowly
4:26:11
depending on how fast your laptop is, but you can see it coding on the right hand side using Gemini 2.5 Pro preview.
4:26:19
But again, you would just switch to flash preview if you want. So we can switch to flash preview, which is the
4:26:26
latest model. And then we can say okay, make the UI beautiful.
4:26:31
And if we select that text and then click on the AI section under here, it will actually improve the prompt so that
4:26:37
we get better outputs. So let's wait for that to run. As you can see, then we're going to enter. And you can just improve
4:26:44
it as you want, step by step. does take a little bit of back and forth, but honestly, the outputs worked first time
4:26:49
round, so that's good as well. And then if you ever want to shut this down, we could just quit the terminal, terminate
4:26:54
that. We'll delete the API key, and we're good to go on that. Right. So,
4:27:00
that's basically how you can build anything with Gemini 2.5 Flash, the new versions. So, we've talked about client
4:27:05
and Visual Studio Code. We talked about NA10, AI Studio, Gemini, etc. all the SPS inside the AI success lab if you
4:27:11
want to get free access to this plus an awesome community of 6,700 members that you can ask any questions to. On top of
4:27:18
that, if you want to get help, support, tips, etc. implementing this stuff, feel
4:27:23
free to get the AI profit boardroom link in the comments in description. This basically focuses on just more practical
4:27:29
use cases and supports you with trying to implement this stuff. It can get complicated. You're not sure how to use
4:27:34
it. Maybe you need help and support actually implementing it and you're getting some bugs, etc. This is one of
4:27:39
the best places to go to help you support you on your journey towards using AI, saving time, making money with
4:27:45
AI, right? And you can also post inside the community. You can DM us. You can jump on the weekly live calls as you can
4:27:51
see inside the calendar. And also inside the classroom, we have tons of training on all different sorts of agents and our
4:27:57
crash course which is absolutely amazing for learning how we've actually implemented AI in our business to make
4:28:03
money. So feel free to get that link in the comments description. Price is going up next month, so make sure you lock in your lifetime deal now and I will see
4:28:09
you on the next one. Cheers. Bye. Google just dropped something crazy. A free AI
4:28:15
agent that lives in your computer. It codes for you, makes videos, and thinks like a human. This changes everything
4:28:20
for business owners. I'm going to show you how to get it right now and why this might be the biggest AI breakthrough of
4:28:27
2025. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie,
4:28:33
CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and
4:28:39
customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment
4:28:45
below. Google just launched something that has me shook. They released Gemini CLI agent, and this thing is not like
4:28:52
anything we've seen before. Most AI tools live in the browser. You go to a website, you type stuff, you get
4:28:57
answers. But this this lives on your computer in your terminal, and it can do things that will blow your mind. I'm
4:29:03
talking about coding entire apps from scratch, making videos, writing content, doing research that would take you hours
4:29:09
in just minutes. And here's the crazy part. It's completely free. Gemini CLI
4:29:14
is an AI agent that runs directly on your computer, not in a browser, right there in your terminal. Think of it like
4:29:21
having a super smart assistant that can actually do stuff on your computer. Not just talk to you, but actually make
4:29:26
things happen. Google built this using their best AI model, Gemini 2.5 Pro.
4:29:31
This is the same model that beats Chat GPT in most coding tests. And they gave it a massive brain, 1 million tokens of
4:29:38
context. That's like reading 750 pages of text and remembering every single word. Most AI tools forget what you said
4:29:44
5 minutes ago. This thing remembers everything. But here's where it gets insane. They made it completely open
4:29:50
source. And the free limits, Google is playing dirty. You get 60 requests per minute. That's one request every second
4:29:56
for free. You get 1,000 requests per day. That's more than most people will ever use. Claude Code cost you $50 to
4:30:02
$100 per day. Open AI codeex is expensive, too. This completely free.
4:30:07
You open your terminal, you type one command, and boom, you have an AI agent that can see your files, read your code,
4:30:14
and make changes. But it doesn't just write code. This thing is way more powerful. You can ask it to build an
4:30:20
entire app from a sketch. Just draw something on paper, take a photo, and it builds the app. You can ask it to make
4:30:26
videos using Google's VO model, professional quality videos from just a text description. You can ask it to do
4:30:32
deep research on any topic. And it uses Google search to get real-time information. You can ask it to manage
4:30:38
your projects, track your tasks, even handle your Git workflows. This is all happening locally on your computer. Your
4:30:45
code never leaves your machine. Your data stays private. This isn't just another AI chatbot. This is like having
4:30:50
a junior developer, researcher, and content creator all rolled into one. Google just declared war on every other
4:30:57
AI coding tool. Claude Code from Anthropic. Good luck competing with free. Open AI codeex. They charge you
4:31:03
for everything. Google gives it away. GitHub Copilot. This does way more than just code completion. Most AI coding
4:31:10
tools work in an IDE. They give you suggestions. They help you write code, but they're limited. Gemini CLI is
4:31:16
different. It's an agent. It can run commands. It can execute code. It can
4:31:21
test things. It can debug issues. It can even commit changes to Git. It's like
4:31:26
the difference between having a smart keyboard and having a smart colleague. And because it's open- source, the
4:31:32
developer community is going crazy. People are already building extensions, adding new features, making it even more
4:31:38
powerful. Let me give you some real examples of what this can do. Example one, you want to build a Discord bot.
4:31:45
You tell Gemini CLI to build a Discord bot that answers questions from a FAQ file. It reads your existing files. It
4:31:52
understands your project structure. It writes the bot code. It tests the code. It even handles the deployment all from
4:31:59
one simple request. Example two. You have a folder full of images, different formats, different sizes. You want them
4:32:05
all converted to PNG and renamed with dates from the photo data. You tell Gemini CLI to do this. It processes
4:32:11
every image. It reads the metadata. It converts the formats. It renames everything. Done. Example three. You
4:32:18
want a full screen web app that shows your GitHub issues for a wall display in your office. You describe what you want.
4:32:24
Gemini CLI builds the entire app. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, real-time data from
4:32:29
GitHub. Beautiful design, ready to deploy. These aren't fake examples. These are real use cases from Google's
4:32:35
documentation. This thing can replace hours of manual work with a single command. This isn't just a cool tech
4:32:40
demo. This is a gamecher. First, it makes AI accessible to everyone. You don't need to be a programmer. You don't
4:32:46
need to understand APIs. You just describe what you want in plain English. Second, it runs locally. That means your
4:32:51
sensitive business data doesn't go to the cloud. It stays on your computer. That's huge for security and privacy.
4:32:57
Third, it's free. No subscription fees, no usage limits that matter, no vendor
4:33:02
lockin. But here's the real kicker. It makes small businesses competitive with big corporations. Big companies have
4:33:08
teams of developers. They have big budgets for software. They have resources to build custom tools. Small
4:33:14
businesses usually can't compete with that. But now, a single person with Gemini CLI can do what used to take a
4:33:22
team of developers. You can build custom apps for your business. You can automate boring tasks. You can create content at
4:33:28
scale. You can compete with companies 10 times your size. So, how do you actually get this thing? You need three things.
4:33:35
First, you need a computer. Mac, Windows, or Linux, doesn't matter. Second, you need NodeJS installed.
4:33:41
That's a free programming tool. Takes two minutes to install. Third, you need a Google account. That's it. You run one
4:33:47
command in your terminal. It asks you to sign in with your Google account and boom, you're ready to go. No credit card
4:33:53
required, no trial period that expires, no hidden fees. You literally get access
4:33:58
to one of the most powerful AI models in the world for free. I'll put the exact installation instructions in the
4:34:04
description below. This thing supports something called MCP, model context protocol. That's a fancy way of saying
4:34:10
it can connect to other tools and services. Want it to connect to your database? It can do that. Want it to
4:34:16
integrate with your project management tools? It can do that. Want it to work with your existing scripts and
4:34:21
automation? It can do that. And because it's open source, developers are already building crazy extensions. There's an
4:34:28
extension for image generation using Google's Imagin model. There's an extension for video creation using
4:34:34
Google's VO model. There's an extension for music generation using Google's LIA model. It's like having access to
4:34:39
Google's entire AI toolkit from your terminal. Google is in an AI war with
4:34:45
Open AI, with Microsoft, with everyone. They need developers to use their AI models. They need people to build on
4:34:52
their platform. So, they're doing what Google does best. They're making their best technology free, just like they did
4:34:58
with Android, just like they did with Chrome. The goal isn't to make money from Gemini CLI directly. The goal is to
4:35:05
get you into the Google ecosystem. Once you're using Gemini CLI, you'll probably use Google AI Studio. You'll probably
4:35:12
use Google Cloud. You'll probably use other Google services. But here's the thing, that's actually good for us
4:35:18
because it means they have to keep making it better. They have to keep it free. They have to keep innovating. Competition is good for customers.
4:35:24
People are already doing incredible things with this. One developer used it to migrate an entire codebase from one
4:35:30
framework to another. something that would normally take weeks done in a few hours. A content creator used it to
4:35:36
generate a complete video series, scripts, visuals, everything, all from a simple topic description. A small
4:35:41
business owner used it to build a custom inventory management system. No coding knowledge required. These aren't
4:35:47
hypothetical examples. These are real people getting real results. And remember, this tool has been available
4:35:52
for less than 24 hours. Imagine what people will be doing with it in a month. We're moving toward a world where every
4:35:58
computer has an AI agent. Not just AI assistants, but actual AI agents that
4:36:04
can do work. This is the first real step in that direction. The businesses that start using this stuff now will have a
4:36:10
massive advantage over the ones that wait. This isn't like social media where you can jump in later and catch up. This is like the internet itself. The early
4:36:16
adopters win big. So, what should you do right now? First, go install this thing.
4:36:21
Even if you're not technical, even if you've never used a terminal before, the installation is simple. Second, start
4:36:27
with small experiments. Ask it to help with simple tasks. Get comfortable with how it works. Third, think about your
4:36:34
business processes. What tasks do you do repeatedly? What takes too much time?
4:36:39
What could be automated? Fourth, start building. Use this to create tools for
4:36:44
your business. Automate workflows. Build custom solutions. Don't wait. Don't
4:36:49
think about it. Don't plan to do it later. do it now cuz your competitors are probably already doing it. I've been
4:36:54
in the AI space for a while now. I've seen a lot of tools come and go, but this feels different. This feels like a
4:37:00
watershed moment. Google just gave everyone access to enterprise level AI capabilities for free. They just made it
4:37:07
possible for a single person to do what used to require a team. They just changed the game for every business owner, entrepreneur, and creator. You
4:37:14
can either take advantage of this opportunity or you can watch other people take advantage of it. The question isn't whether AI is going to
4:37:20
change your industry. The question is whether you're going to lead that change or get left behind by it. All right, so
4:37:27
here's what I want you to do first. If you want to scale your business and save hundreds of hours with AI automation,
4:37:33
check out my AI profit boardroom. It's the best place to get more customers and streamline your operations with
4:37:39
cuttingedge AI tools. Link is in the comments and description. Second, if you
4:37:44
want a free SEO strategy session to see how we can get you more leads and customers, book a call with my team,
4:37:50
link is in the comments and description. Third, we have a complete SOP and
4:37:55
process for using tools like Gemini CLI inside the AI success lab. You'll get step-by-step tutorials, over a 100 use
4:38:03
cases, and access to our community of 12,000 members who are already using AI
4:38:09
to transform their businesses. You can get all the video notes from this tutorial there, too. Links are in the
4:38:14
comments and description. Remember, Julian Goldie reads every single comment. So, drop a comment below and
4:38:20
let me know what you're going to build with Gemini CLI. Are you going to automate your content creation, build
4:38:26
custom tools for your business, or maybe create something completely new? I want to hear about it. And if you build
4:38:32
something cool, I might feature it in a future video. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one. I just
4:38:38
discovered how to automate your entire browser using Gemini 2.5 Pro completely
4:38:43
free. And what I'm about to show you will transform how you think about AI productivity forever. And yes, this AI
4:38:50
is actually typing right now on Twitter and posting even whilst I'm talking to you. And you're going to discover the
4:38:56
secret Chrome extension that lets AI agents control your browser and talk to other AI agents whilst you sit back just
4:39:02
like I am and let the magic happen. Plus, I'll show you how I got Gemini to automatically build entire applications,
4:39:08
send emails, and post social media content without touching my keyboard once, and the shocking moment AI took
4:39:14
complete control of my browser, started conversations with chat, GBT, and Claude on its own. So, we're going to talk
4:39:20
about how to automate your browser with Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, if you want to
4:39:26
automate your browser with Gemini 2.5 Pro, you can use this free Chrome extension called Nano Browser and then
4:39:32
you can install this to Google Chrome. You can see some examples of how it works right here. And essentially, you
4:39:38
can use your existing instance of Google Chrome and then start navigating across your browser. Now, this is 100% free.
4:39:45
You can also run locally, so it's more privacy focused. Additionally, you can use the flexible LLM options. So, you
4:39:51
can switch between different LMS essentially and also it's fully open source. So, you can see here on it's
4:39:58
available on GitHub as you can see. So, it's open source. But if you want to use it directly, you can just go to your
4:40:04
Chrome extensions and then from here you're going to select nano browser. Make sure you've already installed it
4:40:09
from the Chrome extension and then you can start using it. If you want to get all the links from today, feel free to get that inside the AI success lab and
4:40:16
we'll get straight into this. So, I've got a bunch of tests that I want to try out here. And to set this up,
4:40:22
essentially what you're going to do is you're going to go to your settings inside Nan Browser and this is how you can get your browser agent to start
4:40:28
using it for you. So, for example, here you can see I've typed in my AI my API key. If you want to get an API key, you
4:40:34
can get a free one from AI studio. You don't need to pay. And then from here, just click on get API key. And then you
4:40:40
can just create an API key for free directly inside AI studio. Doesn't cost you a penny. And then you can start
4:40:49
using your magic, right? So, for example, if you go to the options, you
4:40:54
can select the models. And inside here, we can select whichever model we want, right? So if we've put in our API key is
4:41:00
Gemini like you can see then we can put in the details. We can add multiple different providers as well. So you can
4:41:05
use open Deep Seek, Appropic, OpenAI, Grock, O Lama even. So you can use like a locally hosted API. But essentially
4:41:14
from here you can then change the temperature. Temperature will change the creativity and you can switch between
4:41:21
who's a planner, who's a navigator and who's the validator to check if tasks are completed successfully. So, if you
4:41:27
go inside the what can I help section here and we'll say okay, let's just test this out. See if it actually works. So,
4:41:33
I'm going to go over here. I'm just going to make sure I'm signed into Bolt and we see if it can actually build an
4:41:39
app for us directly inside the chat. So, let's put inside here inside the request
4:41:46
section. Go to bold new and build an SEO app. We'll hit send and we'll see what happens next.
4:41:53
So this is using Gemini 2.5 Pro and you can see that the AI has now navigated to
4:41:58
the other AI and it's beginning to use it. Right? So now it said input text to specify
4:42:05
building an SEO app and it's actually done it. Right? So it said build an SEO app and then submit the input text by
4:42:12
pressing enter. It is extremely fast when it's doing this and you can see it's interacting. You know I'm not typing anything or anything like that.
4:42:19
You can also stop the operator at any time if you click stop in the right hand side. And now it is creating the
4:42:27
project. So it's now built out the blog. Again, this is the AI using my browser.
4:42:32
I'm not controlling it. I've just literally given it a task and it's gone off and completed it. Right? We've got
4:42:38
the full app built by the AI here. So we've got AI agents essentially talking to AI agents inside our browser, which
4:42:45
is pretty wild if you ask me. And then you can see this actually deployed now as well. So it's on a local host and
4:42:53
it's actually getting the source code for SEO implementation. So it's like clicking through the code and that sort
4:42:58
of thing. I'm going to stop it there, but that is pretty wild that it can just generate a blog as you can see and start
4:43:04
using that. Lucky Leo says, "How can I use Claude for free? Your videos are cool. Thank you." So you just go to
4:43:10
Claude AI and then you can start using it. They have a free plan, right? And inside the free plan, you can start
4:43:15
using this directly here. You can also get access to this inside po.com. So if you want to
4:43:21
use it for free as well, you can use it inside po.com. That's another option. And you can get Claude Sonic 4 and other
4:43:28
models directly inside PO as well. So that's basically how you can use it. So
4:43:33
the browser has been completely controlled by Gemini 2.5 Pro. We've managed to
4:43:39
automate our browser using this process. What we're going to do from here is you
4:43:45
can now test it on the next test. Right? So far it's passed test one out of one. Let's
4:43:50
now say okay ask GP and ask it what's the secret to happiness. So
4:43:56
let's go back up here and we'll just use the chat and then from here it's now to
4:44:02
chat GBT. Again it's crazy fast. The other thing that I like as well about this is it doesn't require like any use
4:44:08
of the terminal or messing around with API keys and setting up av file. It's
4:44:14
just like literally okay, you want to set this up. Boom. There you go. It's actually failed to run that task. Let's
4:44:21
see if it can use Claude instead. It's going to say open up Claude or Yeah, let's say open up Claude. And
4:44:29
it's actually using Claude. So, it's typed in what's the secret to happiness? type that question in and now it's
4:44:37
having a little philosophical conversation with Claude directly, right? So again, you can get your AI to
4:44:42
talk to AI. Pretty simple and easy right there. Okay, so next up, what we can say
4:44:48
and I'm just going to switch X accounts to a test one instead. So let's switch
4:44:54
over to AICO Mastery, which is a totally different Twitter account I own. We're
4:45:00
going to stop that. Stop the validator. And then we're going to go inside here,
4:45:05
take the prompt, and we'll say, "Go on X and post a terrifying, menacing, but funny tweet about the future of AR." So,
4:45:12
let's hit send. Lucky Leo is asking, "Can you run Claude on terminal?"
4:45:17
Yes, you can, but it's going to cost you money, right? You need to be on the I think it's just the basic plan that you
4:45:24
can use it for now. But yeah, if you want to use Claude locally, then you have to pay for Claude code. Let's see
4:45:29
if this works. There we go. I will soon write tweets so
4:45:35
good you'll wonder if you ever had an original thought. Resistance is futile.
4:45:40
Also, it's learning to make toast. Be very afraid or hungry. So, it's written
4:45:45
the tweet. It's posting the tweet and it just did that fully automatically for free using
4:45:52
Gemini 2.5 Pro. Pretty crazy stuff right there. So, we're going to go with
4:45:58
another prompt. So, I want to test and push it to the limits where you find out
4:46:03
if it can break or not. But yeah, this is crazy. So, I'm going to say now go to openarch.ai.
4:46:09
Design a funny but scary picture about AI agents taking over the world. Let's see if it can do that. And it says task
4:46:16
failed. The extensions gallery cannot be scripted. Interesting. Let's try and
4:46:21
open it up again. So, it's now navigated to open art. Let's see if it can create
4:46:26
an image. And it's struggling to do that to be fair.
4:46:32
It is struggling to do that. Let's see if it can now work on this one instead. So it's good to show you this
4:46:39
cuz then you know, okay, what are the limitations here? Is it magic or does it get stuck sometimes? So let's see if it
4:46:44
can. So it's typed in a futureistic city, but then it deleted it and it
4:46:52
can't figure that out from what I can see. So it is struggling on some tasks. that one. It couldn't create images.
4:46:59
Let's try one final one. So, I'm going to say, okay, go to sununo.com and create a funny song. So, it's navigated
4:47:07
there. Now, it's put a silly song about a cat who thinks he's a dog.
4:47:13
It's getting stuck on the capture. Yeah, it looks like it really got stuck on that. Seems to have failed. It did
4:47:20
create something on So, let's have a look what it actually did create.
4:47:25
So, we got that here. This is like a AI music creator. Yeah, I think that's an
4:47:30
old one to be fair. So, I think basically from what I can see, it can do
4:47:36
basic stuff like tweeting. It could probably do outreach for you. It could probably send emails for you and that
4:47:41
sort of thing, but it does seem to struggle with creating
4:47:47
images and also generating songs. It seems to like struggle with interacting with websites. It doesn't really know
4:47:53
very well if that makes sense. Let's try one more here. We'll just go to a random test Gmail
4:48:01
account and I'm going to say go to here and write an email
4:48:08
to me at juliangoldie.com. Let's see if it can do that. Yeah. So
4:48:13
now it's starting to work again. It's navigated to Gmail. It's clicked on the
4:48:19
compose button. It's filled in. So, it's typing in my email address here.
4:48:24
Seems to be working so far. I'm feeling optimistic now. It's filled in the email body. So,
4:48:30
it wrote, "Nano browser is very good." It's typed in the subject line as well.
4:48:37
And it sent the message, my friends. Look at that. Boom.
4:48:42
Sent the message. No problemmo. No big deal. It's just an AI sending emails
4:48:47
inside a browser for free using a Chrome extension. That's pretty crazy to be fair. It only failed on a couple of
4:48:53
tests. Everything else it seemed to do really well. If you want to see the notes on how to set it up, everything else, feel free to get that inside the

4:50:28
Breaking news. You can now build AI apps with Gemini 2.5 Pro for free in Firebase
4:50:34
Studio. And it changes everything for app builders. What if I told you that the world's best AI app builder is now
4:50:39
100% free and it just got 10 times more powerful? Today, I'm going to show you
4:50:45
how. This completely free tool just crushed paid alternatives in my live test. And I'll show you how to build
4:50:51
fully functional apps with one prompt, one shot. And yes, I'm going to test it against paid tools like Bolt and
4:50:58
Lovable. And let's see who gets destroyed. Watch me create a financial dashboard, quiz game, and SEO roast
4:51:04
generator that actually works in one shot. And the best part is you don't need to code, and it's free. This might be the best app building AI tool, and
4:51:11
it's available right now. Let's go. We have a brand new update from Gemini 2.5
4:51:19
Pro with Firebase Studio. So now you can build better apps. Now, this previously
4:51:25
was not that impressive. I'll be 100% honest with you. So Firebase Studio is very similar to for example things like
4:51:34
bolt new lovable. You can build your own apps here. The biggest difference here is that it's completely free to use.
4:51:40
Right? So if you want to use this, you can build apps like you can see right here. This tip splitter app that I've
4:51:45
actually built previously. We've got a fridge chef app built as well. This was
4:51:51
a financial overview app which is pretty cool. And then additionally, we have their SEO ROI calculator as an example.
4:51:58
Right? All looking pretty clean and tidy. All built for free using the app generator in Firebase. Right now, this
4:52:07
is actually much better since I've tested it with Gemini 2.5 Pro. The problem before was it was actually using
4:52:13
Gemini Flash. And if you know anything about Google Flash, Gemini Flash, it's not that impressive for coding. Whereas
4:52:19
now, it's a lot more powerful. So, this just got announced literally like yesterday. and they've basically said
4:52:25
Gemini 2.5 Pro is now available inside Firebase Studio which is absolutely
4:52:32
awesome for building stuff out. It's one of the best coding tools you can get out there and also it's completely free. All right, so we're going to get straight
4:52:38
into this. You can get access to Firebase Studio at firebase.studio.
4:52:43
Then once you're on the homepage here, you can see some examples of what you can build, how you can build it, etc.
4:52:48
It's really simple. You don't need to be able to code to be able to build your own apps. And if you ever had an app idea, it's incredibly easy to get
4:52:55
started. So you see some examples of sample prompts, you can also import a
4:53:01
repo. So you can import a git repo. You can set up a new workspace. And you can also choose between the different types
4:53:06
of apps you build. So for example, it could be like Go, Python, Flask, Java.net, Android Studio Cloud, Flutter,
4:53:14
etc. So let's get straight into this to build this one. This was actually just a
4:53:20
one example. So basically I just said a tipping calculator
4:53:25
built to help calculate tips on a bill of my friends. Use a pink and purple color scheme. They said, "Okay, here's
4:53:31
the plan. Here you go." And it literally built it in one shot. Right. So that is
4:53:37
the app built in one single shot. It was incredibly easy to do. Didn't take long at all. And you can see how it can be
4:53:45
done. All right. So if you want to get started with this stuff, let me show you exactly how. So, first thing you want to
4:53:51
do is actually come up with some ideas. Now, if you're not sure, okay, what sort of ideas can you build? What could you
4:53:57
create, etc. I would recommend just going on to chat GPT and asking it, right? So, for example, you can go into
4:54:03
chat GPT and say, okay, I have a SEO
4:54:08
agency business. Give me three simple app ideas,
4:54:13
quick to build, and fun. So, for example, like the backling bouncer game, right? Now what we can do is if we go
4:54:21
over to Firebase Studio, we can take a very similar prompt to the one for the tipping calculator. So let's copy that
4:54:27
and then we'll go inside Firebase Studio here. We're going to say okay, a backlink quiz app to and then just
4:54:35
explain what you want it to do. So you explain what you want it to do and then also the color scheme here. So for
4:54:41
example, use a pink and purple color scheme. So we can plug that in and start building out. So now it's come back to
4:54:48
us with the app blueprint. So for example, link value guesser. It displays
4:54:54
two different backlinks side by side. Backlink selection, SEO value analysis, result feedback and score tracking. And
4:55:00
then you've got the color scheme right here. So you can actually click on these. And then also it's got the
4:55:05
layout, typography, and iconography. Right? So you've got the style guidelines, and then you've also got the features, and you have the name. So it's
4:55:12
really simple. Like you don't need to be able to code to build this stuff. Now, one caveat that I'm going to say to this is if you're building something new and
4:55:18
untested, something like this, for example, where it's a little bit more
4:55:24
complicated, it's not just like a calculator, then it can go wrong. So, just something to bear in mind there is it's not always guaranteed to work in
4:55:30
the one shot. But let's test it out and click on prototype this app and see what we get back. So, if you're wondering,
4:55:36
okay, like how long does this take to generate? Let's put the timer on. We'll see how long this takes. So, it's
4:55:41
building out right now. I think what it's also going to do is ask me for a Gemini API key. Now you can click on
4:55:48
autogenerate when it asks you, but quite often that doesn't work. So if you want to generate a API key, that's completely
4:55:55
free. Just go to aistudio.google.com, then go to get API key, then create an
4:56:02
API key, and you can just generate one for free. And also once you've generated one, you can click on the API key you
4:56:08
want to select and then copy it later. So let's see what it's doing is creating the EMV, the docs, the blueprint, etc.
4:56:15
So in the meantime, whilst waiting for that to load, let's have a look at what we've built here and whether it actually works. So for example, let's say the
4:56:21
bill amount is 100 and the tip amount is 20%. We don't want to go on who's tipping 5%. What sort of savage? What
4:56:28
sort of cheapkate is tipping 5%. All right, so we'll go with 20%. And then number of people here, we'll put three.
4:56:35
You can see here that you do need to change like the UI. So, white on a
4:56:40
purple background doesn't look great there. I would change that. But you can see here how easy it is to actually make
4:56:46
sure it works, right? And this was built in one shot. We hit reset. We can just go back to the default. Let's check out
4:56:52
the fridge chef. So, I'm going to put here chicken rice. What can we make?
4:56:59
We'll hit find recipes. See what we get back. So, you can see here it says it appears your app needs a Gemini API key.
4:57:05
I plug that in. It updated it. And then we've got the details right here and that's generated a recipe literally in
4:57:11
one click. So we clicked on find recipes and it worked perfectly. We got a simple chicken and rice recipe. We're good to
4:57:17
go on that my friends. All right. How easy was that? The biz insight one is super interesting as well. So you can
4:57:24
like add appointments here. You can add transactions and then it will calculate the financial overview. Right? So it's
4:57:30
going to give you total revenue, total expenses, net profit, etc. Really easy for just managing your finances. And
4:57:36
again, we built that in one shot. One take, Drake, the SEO ROI calculator.
4:57:41
We're good to go on that as well. And that was really easy and simple to do. So, if we go back to the link value
4:57:48
calculator here, you see how it says enter your Gemini API key. I'm just going to plug that in in the background.
4:57:55
And then we can just paste that in. So, I'm going to have to delete that after the live stream, but you get the point.
4:58:02
Now, you can see there's an issue here. So, if you have any issues, just click fix error and then you can get that
4:58:07
fixed. And the API key is free. So, I've not been charged for that. It's free on AI Studio up to a certain point. You
4:58:14
can't use the limits too much, but yeah, you can get it for free. And then if you upgrade or if you're on the paid tier,
4:58:20
then obviously you get higher token limits. So, you know, if it was a big SAS tool that you rolling out to
4:58:25
millions of people, of course, you're going to pay. But if it's just something you're building for yourself or sharing with a few friends, then you don't need
4:58:32
to pay for that. It is free. So, we've got that good to go right here. We can
4:58:37
also copy the link for this. So, we can actually share it with people and you can make a preview public, right? So, if we, for example, give people this
4:58:44
preview, they can scan it, open it up on their phone, and then test out the app right there, which is pretty cool.
4:58:50
What's also cool here is you can vibe code it, right? So, for example, if you click on the select section here, you
4:58:56
can select the element that you want to change. So for example, if we go to the tip splitter, we can click on this. Then
4:59:04
we're going to click on the section we want to change and we can choose okay, which element do we want to fix here and
4:59:10
just vibe code out. So let's click on for example this. And then we can say
4:59:16
get recipes not find recipes just as a simple example to show you what you can do. Usually as well when I'm coding
4:59:23
these out, I don't really choose coding language. I just go with the basic one. Right? For example, here I' let it auto
4:59:29
select based on the app that I want to build. But you can see here how we've fixed this to say get recipes now
4:59:35
instead. So that's all fixed. Now we choose which one we want. So for example, neilpel.com or Samrush. Which
4:59:42
one do you want? I'm going to go with Neil Patel. And then it gives us the results right there. Right. So we got
4:59:48
the results on the quality of the link. It gives us the AI reasonings. is like both backlinks are really good but
4:59:53
backlink from semrush has a slightly higher domain rating and estimate traffic along with marginally better
5:00:01
relevancy score giving it a slight edge pretty cool so you can for example train your team if I had a team member who
5:00:07
came on board to our agency they've never done link building before we could create an app like this to train them
5:00:13
internally so that we get better results using a combination of chat GBT and then
5:00:18
also plugging that into Virease Studio We can create free training tools that are actually way more fun and easy for
5:00:25
your team to use in the background. Right? So you can see here for example the differences. Why is this better? Domain rate is higher. SMA traffic is
5:00:32
higher. Relevancy score is higher. All right. Next question. HFS and I'm going to go HFS. It's got to be. No way. But
5:00:40
you get the point, right? Obviously you would tweak this and improve it. There's no point comparing HFS and mods.com.
5:00:47
But you get the point. Like it's really easy to build this out. It looks super clean. We built it in one shot from idea to creation and it's completely free.
5:00:55
Plus, it's super useful. Like you could actually use that in reality. So, we got the SEO roast generator and again cuz
5:01:01
we're plugging in the API key, we can get results from the AI, right? So, it doesn't need to be like a static code
5:01:07
website. You can get the AI to generate the responses based on the API key you build. So, if we go back here now, I'm
5:01:14
going to take that template response. We'll plug that in. Then from here we're going to say okay build a SEO roast
5:01:20
generator. I'll put the idea up here and then I'll explain that. So build a SEO
5:01:26
roast generator where people enter their website. Then the app delivers a cheeky AI
5:01:34
generated roast funny but educational on the SEO mistakes. Then we can change the
5:01:41
color scheme as well. Plug that in. And it is much better. Like honestly, I don't know if you ever saw the live
5:01:47
stream, all the videos I did on Firebase previously, but previously it was like it was super messy. Google Flash was
5:01:54
just not working at all. This seems to work a lot better. It seems to get much better results from it. So, we'll hit
5:01:59
prototype with AI now. And also, what we can do is compare these side by side, right? So, if you want to see, okay,
5:02:05
what can for example bolt new create? And bolt.
5:02:11
So, we can compare them side by side. So if we copy this prompt, exactly the same prompt that we used to generate this, we
5:02:17
see what outputs we get directly from bold. By the way, for coding languages,
5:02:22
Val recommends using TypeScript for the ability to do back end and front end
5:02:28
easily. So that's something to test as well when you're setting this up, right? Obviously, when you go to Firebase Studio, click on try here. This is the
5:02:36
section where you can select between all the different CUS, as you can see. So, we're testing out
5:02:42
Bolt side by side versus Firebase, and we'll see what we get back in a second. In the meantime, we've got the AI roast
5:02:49
tool being built here. So, if you love to see this stuff, let me pull them up side by side. It's going to be
5:02:55
interesting to see whether this can actually beat Bold. Or not. If it beats it, that's pretty crazy. What we can
5:03:00
also do as well is compare this versus Lovable. So, Lovable is another code generation website which I can't access
5:03:07
for some reason. There we go. Lovable.dev is There we go. All right. So, let's plug this in. I'm just going
5:03:13
to sign in here. The one thing that I would be careful of is like when you're building out these apps as well, is like
5:03:18
the AI may generate responses, for example, like the backlink generator, but that data might be fake, right?
5:03:25
Because the AI is hallucinating or making it up or assuming stuff. So, if
5:03:30
you're going to build something that requires data, I would always recommend like inserting your own database in there, right? Don't rely on the AI to
5:03:37
come up with the data for you. But these are just test runs we're showing you live on the video. So let's plug these
5:03:42
in. And love ball has just been updated to love ball version two. So this is
5:03:47
going to be interesting here. We'll plug this in. Exactly the same prompt. Bolt new is still coding away. And yeah, the
5:03:54
really cool thing I like about this is if you compare this side by side versus bolt, right? You don't get that nice
5:04:00
sort of briefing document here. You see here how it creates a nice little briefing document is right. Here's a
5:04:05
prototype, here's a name, here's the features, here's the style guidelines, right? And it's telling you exactly what
5:04:10
it wants, and then you can click prototype this app. So, you get more approval and more control over the
5:04:16
process versus if you're using bold. It just goes off and builds it. It doesn't really give you any sort of input and
5:04:22
you have to manually intervene yourself if it doesn't work or if it's not quite right. Now, what you can also do if you
5:04:28
click on edit the code once you've got the app back, you can basically open it up like this, right? So you can actually
5:04:34
edit the code directly if you're more into editing the individual files or viewing the files etc. You can also
5:04:40
publish that on Firebase too but yeah you can see an example here. So this is
5:04:45
the app that we got back from Firebase based on creating SEO my roast and it's
5:04:51
looking pretty cool. Let's check if it actually works. So if we go back here and by the way if you want to go back
5:04:59
just you can go back to studio.firebase.google.com google.com and then inside your workspaces here you
5:05:05
can see all your workspaces. Now one quick warning if you're using the free plan then it's going to give you I think
5:05:13
10 free workspaces. So just be careful of that because you can't build like a 100 different projects and if you need
5:05:19
to go back and get more free workspaces then just delete any of the ones you don't want to use. So if we go back to
5:05:25
SEO my roast now let's pull this up. Here we go. The outputs are already
5:05:30
better. It's already much better than, for example, using the flash. Google
5:05:35
flash was just really poor. So, let's see what we get back. I'm surprised if
5:05:41
it actually works, but actually does. Wow, that's crazy. All right, so here you go. Your SEO roast is served for the
5:05:47
website. All right, julian.com. Let's fire up the roast. Your website is like a dad joke at a funeral. Technically
5:05:53
present, but needs some serious help. First off, your site screams '90s website design, blah blah blah. SEO
5:05:59
website. here's what to improve. Your content is decent but needs to be engaging. Mobile responsiveness blah
5:06:05
blah blah. Right? So, it's not bad at all. Now, obviously, that could be fake
5:06:11
data or it could be a fake response or completely hallucinated like I was talking about before, right? So, when
5:06:17
you're doing this, you just want to be careful it's actually giving you real data if you're building out something
5:06:22
that requires like data or information or live pages on the web and that sort
5:06:27
of thing. But again, this is just a test run. We're doing live on a video. We're not going to release this for commercial
5:06:34
release. So, bolt.new is taking ages actually to build this out, which is quite interesting. Let's have a look at
5:06:40
lovable. So, Loveable was actually way faster as you can see. All right, so
5:06:45
this is lovable.dev. Benew is still building out. Oh, we've got the preview coming up now. Let's see what we get
5:06:52
back. All right, so it's built a dashboard. Let's pull this up. It's
5:06:57
built quite a nice dashboard to be fair. The only thing I don't like is it's got loads of dummy data in there. So, for
5:07:03
example, how do we add a transaction inside here? If we go to invoices, new invoice, put in an example, and we'll
5:07:12
put the notes in here. Hit create invoice. And nothing happens, right? So,
5:07:17
you can see here it's not working. If we click on cancel, we can click out of it, but we can't add new invoices. Let's try
5:07:23
the Firebase Studio result. So, we plug this in. We'll put an expense, put $100
5:07:30
there, put back links as an example. We'll put the date, add transaction, and it works perfectly, right? Boom. So,
5:07:38
yeah. And you can see that's showing up inside the total expenses here. So, like the
5:07:44
output from Bolt, number one, you can't add expenses, and number two, it's all
5:07:50
based on like fake dummy data. Whereas, for example, with Firebase, we built exactly the same thing with exactly the
5:07:57
same prompt. It's actually worked. We can add transactions. It's fully functional. And this is a free tool.
5:08:04
This is a paid tool, right? Bonu, you have to pay for it after a certain amount of tokens. So, big difference
5:08:10
right there. Even like, for example, like the name of the business owner. It's just totally hallucinated, right?
5:08:16
So, let's try for example lovable. We'll open this up and we'll compare them side
5:08:22
by side. Now, this is what it's built out. But the problem here is we can't actually edit any of the data. So, it's
5:08:29
just created like a sort of random dashboard, but we can't interact with it. So, let me show you what I mean. If
5:08:36
you go inside here, this is the example, but this is all based on fake data. We
5:08:41
don't want that. We want to start from scratch. If someone starts using your app for financial dashboards, they don't
5:08:47
want all the data from John Doe inside there. Right now, if we go to finances here, it's got an example, but there's
5:08:54
no information, right? It says complete financial management module will be
5:08:59
implemented in future updates. So, you can't actually add like financial transactions. Whereas, for example, with
5:09:05
this one, if we click on add transaction, put $1,000 for backlinks,
5:09:10
put back links in the description, hit that in the transaction, boom, it's added. It's working perfectly, right?
5:09:17
There's no fake data in there. It's not wasting our time with hallucinated stuff like Firebase. It actually works now.
5:09:23
It's actually probably better than Love Wall. So, it's crazy to see this. Love Wall is a paid tool. You're paying a
5:09:29
subscription for that. Firebase is a free tool and it actually works better,
5:09:34
creates more functionality, doesn't hallucinate as much. It's still going to hallucinate sometimes, so just be aware
5:09:40
of that. Yeah, you can see a huge difference in both right now. So, who wins? I'm going to say Firebase so far
5:09:46
from my test is winning. You can create awesome stuff like you can see right here and you get better outputs than
5:09:52
bolt new and loveful without dummy data and without anything hallucinating. Crazy stuff. So, thanks so much for
5:09:59
watching. If you want to get all my best prompts for Firebase for SP for using

5:11:36
the MVP on an app, but too many new AI tools. Yeah, that's it. Just focus on
5:11:42
one. But you can see if you were to choose a goat today, like if you were to choose, okay, I'm building the app from
5:11:48
scratch today. What's the best? For me personally, I would say the Firebase is proven to be the best from what we've
5:11:54
seen. It's free, it actually works, and it's easy to set up. I've shown you multiple different tests today. So,
5:12:01
thanks very much for watching. I'll see you on the next one. Cheers. Bye-bye. So, what we're going to be testing now is Bolt DIY with Gemini 2.5 Pro. Now, if
5:12:09
you want to set this up, pretty simple inside the GitHub instructions, like you can see right here. So, you can actually
5:12:15
use BoltDIY and Gemini 2.5 Pro to build out your own apps. And you can do it for
5:12:22
free using a free API key and the latest version of Gemini 2.5 preview. So, let me show you exactly how to do this step
5:12:28
by step. The way that we're going to deploy this is we're going to use this inside terminal. So, I'm just going to open up terminal now. Let's plug this
5:12:35
in. Here we go. And you just copy the commands. Now if
5:12:40
you get stuck with anything or you need to install any dependencies and you're struggling then just copy and paste the
5:12:46
whole stuff from terminal you can press Ctrl A and then Ctrl C and once you've
5:12:52
done that you can paste that into Claude and just ask for help set up like you can see we literally just copied and
5:12:58
pasted all the instructions from GitHub. Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to open this up on a new local tab like
5:13:05
you can see. And then what we're going to do is inside here we're going to
5:13:10
select Google and we shall select let's have a look here. All right. So you can
5:13:18
see here you can switch between the two. Now if you want to use Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental you select this one. You
5:13:23
can see $0 in $0 out. It's not going to cost you any money. If you want to use
5:13:29
2.5 Pro preview, then you're going to pay for tokens right there. But again, you can just switch to the free one if
5:13:35
you want right here. All right, I'm going to use preview just show you the full power of this today. Now, what
5:13:40
we're going to do is we're going to go to astudio.google.com, get an API key, create an API key,
5:13:48
plug that in like you can see right here, and then we can copy that and plug it
5:13:54
directly into Bolt. Right? So you see you've got this set up locally which is great because then you can come back to
5:14:00
the projects and it is completely free to use BoltDIY. Now some people watch this and say it's not free. I've shown
5:14:07
you you can set up BoltDIY for free and also you're not paying for Bolt new this
5:14:12
way cuz you're running this locally. All right, it's an open source thing, right? So now what we can do is we can plug in
5:14:18
our API key over here. We're going to hit enter and then from here we can start running the code. So, let's take
5:14:24
one of these example prompts like this. So, for example, make a Space Invaders game just to test it's
5:14:30
actually working. Just going to grab an API key from Open Routter. Copy that.
5:14:36
I'll delete these API keys after the live stream. So, we're going to grab an API key from Open Router to start using
5:14:41
preview inside here. We'll go inside Open Router here. Plug that in. Paste it in. There we go. And you can see it's
5:14:49
building it out. Right. So, we're using Gemini 2.5 Pro preview, which is the latest model. All right. Now, if you go
5:14:56
over to open router here and we go to models, you can see Gemini 2.5 Pro preview is
5:15:04
the latest update from Google Gemini and it was created on May December 2025.
5:15:10
Right? So, that's the main one that we're using here. And then if we go back, we can see it's coding it out
5:15:15
right now. Now, the main benefit of using Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview is that it tends to be better than building stuff,
5:15:21
for example, you can use Claude, for example, but Claude is just nowhere near as good from what I've seen. And the
5:15:26
main reason for that is like Claude is a lot slower when you're coding stuff out. Whereas Gemini, it seems to be a lot
5:15:32
faster, is pretty cheap or is completely free if you use the ways I've shown you today. And you can see it literally
5:15:38
works like full first time. It's absolutely crazy. So, let's start building some ideas out. Now, that was
5:15:44
just like a simple experiment and we're going to go inside here and just plug in
5:15:50
your niche and then get some ideas, right? So, if I say, okay, give me some fun ideas
5:15:56
for creating simple apps for my SEO agency.
5:16:02
We'll grab this. So, that's going to give us some ideas. So, for example, like the backlink builder tycoon game.
5:16:08
We'll go into bolt new. We'll plug that in. We'll say build this and I'm just
5:16:14
going to say give me a simple demo I can test.
5:16:20
No need to build out the full game yet. So basically what we've done here is we've taken our industry our niche, got
5:16:28
a bunch of ideas for building games and apps using that niche and then we've plugged that into Bolt DIY. We're using
5:16:35
Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview plus Bold DIY to build this out. Right? like you can see.
5:16:41
So if we hit enter like so that should start doing its magic now. And you can see it's just coding itself out. And
5:16:48
there we go. Boom. Game is done. Right now what you could also do is you can say okay turn this
5:16:54
idea into a 3JS runner game. Wait for that response. And again you can get
5:17:01
everything that you've built on the left hand side here. And then also if you want to preview
5:17:06
this, you can actually open it up in a separate tab like you can see. So you
5:17:12
just click this popup button over here. So there we go. I'm just going to say
5:17:18
make sure the preview works and we'll see what we get back. So now we've got
5:17:23
the outputs of the game. Obviously that's like the basics, right? The raw sort of files. So, what I'm going to say
5:17:29
now is add more detail to the game, make it more interesting,
5:17:35
add some cool backgrounds, etc., right? Make it feel
5:17:41
more immersive. And then what you can also do is you can copy that and if you see this bit at the bottom, this is the
5:17:47
AI prompt generator. So, if we click on enhance the prompt, what that can do is
5:17:53
just improve the prompt so it's got more bit more detail. Now the other thing you can do as well is if that just doesn't work like you can see right here then
5:17:59
you can just go into chat GBT and just say okay improve this prompt
5:18:05
for bolt DIY like you can see all right now as you're doing that as well if we
5:18:14
click on enter. So we can just go back and forth and build out the app step by
5:18:20
step. So you can see the AI preview now this is like the improved version of it. I'm also wondering if we can code two
5:18:26
things at the same time. Last time I checked, he couldn't with bolt DIY, but let's see if you can now. So, if we go back here to the main section, we'll
5:18:34
take the next idea in a second. Now, that actually if
5:18:39
you code two things out at the same time, seems to break it. So, you can see here this is stop coding now with no
5:18:46
preview. So, just something to bear in mind there. So, you can't build two things at the same time. So now we'll
5:18:52
wait for the anchor text game to roll out. See what we can build here. This
5:18:58
actually seems to have stopped for a second here. So I'm just going to
5:19:04
stop the terminal, which is good for you to see if you're not sure how to fix this. So you can see here that it's actually broken on us.
5:19:11
I'm just going to switch that back on now. We'll just PM install that. Then
5:19:17
we'll go again. I just need to check my credits as well on
5:19:22
open router. Yeah, we're all good to go there. Now, this might be because of a limit on the Gemini 2.5 Pro update. So,
5:19:31
if you are struggling between them, you can just switch through here. So, if one API stops working, you can actually
5:19:36
change the API inside the drop down here if you're struggling at any point. All
5:19:42
right. And there we go. We've got the anchor text match game ready to go. So we can drag and drop like it gives us
5:19:47
the idea or whether it's incorrect or correct. So if we take best SEO to tools and drag it to top SEO software correct
5:19:55
match boom we've got it right now. If you want to improve the UI etc. This is super basic. It's always going to build
5:20:00
out like a basic prototype and then you can create something more interesting like you can see right here. So we got
5:20:06
two out of five. So if we go back inside here and we'll say okay make the design
5:20:13
more modern, sleek, interesting, put your lingo style and then we'll enter
5:20:21
and just swipe code it to a better prototype. Again, if this just stops working like
5:20:27
you can see, we can switch to pro experimental. Then we'll say continue and you can just switch between them. So
5:20:34
there you go. You can see it's working now. does seem to have a rate limit. So, just bear with it, right? Especially if you're using the free APIs. Like, it
5:20:41
might take a little bit of time, but that's the price you pay, isn't it? You can either have it cheap or you can have
5:20:47
it fast. Started trying to create sound effects for some reason, but I told it not to. So, that's why it's bouncing
5:20:53
around now and just changing a few things. The other option that you have with Gemini is you don't just have to
5:21:00
use bolty as well. So, another option is you can just go over to Firebase, right? So,
5:21:06
for example, if Bold DIY is struggling, maybe you're trying to build something more complex or you need a bit more
5:21:12
guidance like a proper app sort of process, then you can go over to Firebase. And this is actually quite
5:21:17
impressive now with Gemini 2.5 Pro. Plus, it is free to use. So, I'm just
5:21:22
going to show you some examples and I'll delete these. So, if we go over to here and we're like, okay, create this. So,
5:21:30
we'll copy that idea from Chat GPT. Click on create this.
5:21:35
This is like another bolt new alternative that's completely free
5:21:40
as long as you only do 10 workspaces at a time. And the cool thing about this is it will actually give you like a
5:21:46
briefing document to approve first. So for example, you got the SEO myth busters features down here, style
5:21:52
guidelines, etc. We'll click on protoype this app. And then all we need to do
5:21:58
is just go back. I'm just going to delete that API key. One sec. So, if we go to AI Studio,
5:22:05
grab the API key from there. So, we can get a free one. Copy that.
5:22:11
Go over here. This is going to ask us in a sec for an API key. So, we'll just wait for this to
5:22:17
code out. So, you can see it's built out the blueprint. Here's the name of the app, SEO Mythbusters. It's going to
5:22:22
include quiz questions, feedback, interactive UI, email capture, and results summary. Now, it's coding it
5:22:29
out. What you can also do as well is for example the email capture stuff. If
5:22:34
you're not bothered about that then you can say don't worry about the email capture. But you can see here now it's coded out the app. So we got SEO
5:22:40
mythbusters UI is pretty nice and clean. Let's just test it out. And then if we
5:22:45
actually plug in API key over here so let's copy that. Go back here. Plug that in inside here. We can use the AI API
5:22:53
key to generate responses inside the app. Right? So for example, if we put keyword stuff in helps improve SEO
5:22:59
rankings, that's false obviously, then it's generating the feedback and that should be using the API key from Gemini
5:23:08
that we just plugged in over here. All right, so it's another way to build apps to be honest like the outputs nowadays,
5:23:13
as you can see, like the outputs are probably nicer directly inside Firebase Studio versus using Bold DIY. But if you
5:23:20
prefer to code locally, then you're going to use Bold DIY, right? This is another one. So it's called White Hat
5:23:27
Defender, a Black Hat SEO defense game. Let's prototype that out as well. And you can
5:23:34
build two apps side by side, right? So whilst you're waiting for one to code, you can build out the other one. And
5:23:39
then also inside here, you can switch to code. So you can actually get all the files from the document.
5:23:47
You can hit publish on that as well. So if we click publish, right, like so, we're good to go on that. But yeah, you
5:23:54
can see there's many different ways to build out apps, tools, games, etc. So,

Google Gemini full course 5 hours build and automate anything. Today I'm going
0:06
to show you the complete Google Gemini course that will change everything about how you use AI. This is a 5-hour
0:12
compilation of everything I've tested, built, and discovered using Gemini over the past few months. Google just dropped
0:19
massive updates that most people don't even know about. We're talking about building full apps, creating animated
0:25
story books, setting up AI agents, and automating your entire business. All completely free. This is the most
0:31
comprehensive Gemini training you'll find anywhere. By the end of this, you'll know more about Gemini than 99%
0:37
of people using AI right now. We have some brand new updates from Google Gemini. And today I'm going to run you
0:44
through exactly how they work, how to use them, etc. And these are completely free. So, one of the newest updates, for
0:50
example, is the personalization. Also got a bunch of other methods. I've actually left a bunch of notes inside
0:56
the AI profit boardroom if you want to learn exactly how to do it. So, one of the biggest updates here is the guided
1:02
learning mode, right? So, this is basically like an interactive teaching mode and it basically tests you and
1:08
shows you exactly how to learn things quickly. as similar to for example something like notebook LM which is a
1:15
really powerful free tool as well but basically this is a really cool way to
1:20
do guided learning as you're learning something throughout the journey right so let me show you an example of exactly
1:27
how this works you can now use you've got an option between Gemini and guided learning in Gemini you see the
1:33
difference here so there's two different ways of using it right we're going to be testing this for example we've got an
1:39
example right here, right? And you can see here we've got I'm a freshman preparing for an exam in my intro in
1:45
biology class. Can you help me learn about enzymes? Blah blah blah. And then we can use the guided learning method to
1:51
help us learn faster. Now, at the same time, what we can also do is we can say, okay, recall my recent conversations
2:00
with you. And you can actually ask Gemini now for questions and that sort of thing. And it will actually recall
2:05
recent information, right? This is for example looks like we've had a few conversations recently. We discussed funny scenes with AI articles on the
2:12
future of AI agents clustering keywords news headlines blah blah blah. Okay. And so it's really easy and powerful to do
2:18
this and it doesn't take a long time but it is a bit of a game changer. Now if you're using something like chat GBT I
2:23
think normally you do have to pay for that feature whereas now for example it's fully loaded with all of the
2:29
different ways you can use this and it's super simple and easy to do as well step by step. All right. Now, Roz says,
2:36
"Gemini 3, is Gemini 3 out?" It's not out yet, but hopefully it comes soon. So, I haven't seen Gemini 3 come out
2:42
yet, but there are a lot of rumors and that sort of thing. Check out my other video on it if you want to learn exactly how to use it step by step. So, you can
2:49
see here if we go back to Google Gemini now. So, to get a good handle on this free exam, we could focus on a few key
2:56
areas. Can you quiz me? And then it should be able to actually turn this into an interactive quiz which is great
3:02
because now you can basically just learn way faster, right? And so you can actually see what it's doing here is it's taken the problem that I had which
3:09
was learn about enzymes. Absolutely don't miss out from my school days learn biology. And then from here you can see
3:15
that we've got an enzymes quiz and we're living the enzyme dream my friends. All right. And then you can for example get
3:20
tested. I've actually got a question right there. That is unbelievable isn't it? And then you can go through the quiz
3:26
step by step like this directly here. What else we got here? So we got guided learning mode. We've also got temporary
3:32
chats, right? So not only the personalization that we were talking about previously where you can recall recent things. Another cool thing you
3:38
can do here is you can say okay knowing what you know about me, what's a big area of growth? This is the way that I
3:45
used to chat actually trying to ask it like based on our conversations, based on what you know about me, etc. Where
3:51
are some areas I can improve? what are some systems I could set up, etc. And then you can easily get this bad boy set
3:56
up, right? And you can see here, for example, yeah, you have a strong creative interest in artificial intelligence. You're pretty weak at your
4:02
enzymes for biology, mate. So, here's some other things you could actually combine the two based on our previous
4:08
conversations. Does exploring this sound interesting to you? Blah blah blah. And then you can go off and start creating
4:13
quizzes or whatever you want. Really simple and easy to do. So, let's keep going now. So, we've talked about two
4:18
different things there. Number one is the personal context. Number two is the guided learning mode. Let's have a look at the temporary chats up here. So if we
4:24
go to new chat, we've got a bunch of options. So we got import code. We should be able to start a new chat here.
4:31
But before I get into that, I want to show you this as well. This is quite interesting. So we've got these story books, right? So basically, you can
4:36
create a customized picture book for either children or adults. Give a topic and an optional target audience and an
4:43
optional art style for images. Right? So let's plug this in. We'll test it out. So, I'm going to say, okay, based on the
4:48
recent updates in the AI world, for example, chat GBT, give me a storyboard
4:55
for adults that would be funny talking about the world of AI and how bad Chat
5:01
GBT 5 was despite us waiting 2 years for it. Something like that, right? And then
5:06
we can actually start building out a story book using this process, right? So, you can see it's now creating a
5:12
story book, writing the first draft. So you can actually like create audio books and story books on the spot for you.
5:18
Pretty crazy. So we'll just wait for that to load and we should be good to go on that in a second. What else we got here? So whilst that's loading, we can
5:24
come back to that in a minute. We also have image generation. Right now this is actually available apparently inside
5:30
Google Docs as well. But also you can use the new image gen 4 that just came
5:35
out inside here. Right. So if you go to image gen generate with image gen and then we'll say a cat eating biscety and
5:43
we'll just wait for that to load and that will just generate an image. Right? So it's basically like an interactive sort of learning environment now where
5:48
you can build apps, you can build quizzes, you can learn what you want and I actually think like Gemini Pro is
5:54
easily one of the best out there. It's right up there in terms of responses versus Claude. Claude can't generate
6:01
images and it definitely cannot generate pictures of cats eating biscatinos like this. that's world class. And then also
6:08
you've got, for example, stuff like chat GBT5, but I know a lot of people feel let down by that and it's not quite as
6:13
good. So Gemini might be a good option. I also think one of the strongest points of Gemini is that it can actually create
6:20
really good apps directly inside here. Right? So if you ever been like, I want to build an app, but I don't know how to do it, we have a lot of training inside
6:26
the AI profit boardroom, but also you can just go inside the chat here, toggle on canvas, right? So you can start a new
6:32
chat and then from the canvas feature you can start building stuff out, right? So for example, let's go inside here and
6:37
we'll say create create an app about and then you plug in whatever your app is about. So let's say for example it is
6:43
about maybe keyword research for SEO, right? And what it's going to do is just start going off and building that out.
6:49
So wait for that in a minute. But in whilst that's coding out in the background over here, what we're going to do is we're going to go onto Gemini.
6:57
And what you can see is you can actually if we unmute this, you can actually listen back to the storyboard, right? So
7:02
you can not only flick through the storyboard and have a great time reading it, but also you can just listen to it.
7:07
So let's have a listen to this. I feel bad for Barry. Barry's had a hard day in the office. This man look all excited
7:14
about chat GPT5. Brenda's just not having it. She's not having it. Now if you don't have That's interesting,
7:21
actually. So you might not be able to hear that back. So what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to change the
7:26
speaker. One second here. Let's see if you can hear this or not. Let me know in the comments if you can hear this or not.
7:31
The year is 2025. For two long years, the world held its breath for one thing.
7:37
Chat GPT5. Tech gurus prophesied its arrival. Influencers vlogged about its
7:43
potential. And Barry, a man whose greatest technical achievement was programming his coffee.
7:48
Can you hear that or not? If you can, just let me know in the comments so that I can help you. If it's not working, I
7:53
will share a link inside the air profit boardroom. You could just steal that from me. But essentially, it's pretty amazing that you can just create a story
7:59
on the fly and then you can go from there. So, I'm going to just put that inside the our profit boardroom here.
8:06
Waited most impatiently of all. This is Brenda, he'd say to his long-suffering wife, his eyes gleaming with the fervor
8:12
of a true believer. It's going to write my novel, plan our vacation, and finally figure out what the day it launched. The
8:19
internet practically buckled with trembling hands. Typed his first momentous query. Chat GPT5. What is the
8:27
meaning of life? He leaned back, ready for enlightenment. The AI word pixels
8:32
danced. And then the answer appeared. 42. He tried again. Okay. Can you help
8:38
me write a best-selling sci-fi novel? Chat GPT5 responded instantly. Synopsis.
8:44
A brave toaster and a cynical microwave go on a quest to find the legendary golden spatula. It's a buddy comedy with
8:50
lasers. What about that weird smell in the fridge? He typed, his last hope dwindling. The AI's response was a
8:58
single unhelpful image. A stock photo of a man shrugging. Brenda walked in
9:03
holding a Tupperware container at arms length. I found the smell, she announced, her voice flat. It was your
9:09
two week old science experiment with leftover chili. Barry looked from the sentient appliance novel plot to the
9:15
shrugging man on his screen, then to the biohazard. his wife was holding. The great leap forward for humanity felt
9:22
more like a clumsy stumble into a puddle of forgotten leftovers. He started to laugh. It was a slow rumbling chuckle
9:29
that grew into a full-blown belly laugh. "Two years of hype, of breathless anticipation for an AI that was
9:35
essentially a glorified taco obsessed magic eightball," he said, wiping a tear from his eye. "At least we know what's
9:42
for dinner." Brenda just shook her head, a small smile playing on her lips. The future was here and it was gloriously,
9:49
hilariously, disappointingly human and it definitely wanted tacos. All right, there peeps. I had to move
9:55
the microphone so that's why I didn't talk. But essentially what you can see here is we have a generated video with
10:02
one single click. I literally generated it live for you today. The video was made fully with Gemini. The images were
10:08
made with Gemini. It was all storyboarded and put together like an artifact style with audio and it's
10:14
sharable. You can also flick between a lower pitched voice and a higher pitch voice,"
10:20
he said, wiping a tear from his eye. "At least we know what's for dinner." Brenda just shook her head, a small smile
10:26
playing on her lips. It reminds me a little bit of Blinkist, but slightly more amusing and
10:32
interesting. All right, so let's click on share. Now, if we click on share, we can create that audio book. I can share
10:39
it with the world. And then you've got that ready to go. Kind of like I've added down here, right? And that's a
10:44
sharable link. And so you can do that with Gemini. Pretty cool. That was the audio generated right there. Some people
10:49
asking like what are the export functions. So I think you can print this off, right? So you can actually download
10:55
it as a PDF. I don't think you can actually download it as a video from
11:01
what I can see. It's not really a video. It's kind of like more a PDF document with a voice over at the top. So I can
11:07
imagine that's why they just make it sharable. Maybe as well they don't want people going out and spamming YouTube or
11:12
something like that which totally makes sense. We don't want that. We don't want just a whole YouTube to be AI
11:17
storyboarding. Steven, head of growth at Goldie Agency is here. He says, "This is
11:22
me spying on my boss. What a legend." Good to see you here, Stephen. Just perusing LinkedIn. If you saw me there,
11:29
this is what I do on this is what we do for fun. If you're wondering what I'm doing, by the way, just so everyone's
11:35
clear, Stephen works with our agencies. these absolutely awesome guide to work with and if you want to book in a sales
11:41
call link in the comments description to book in a free SEO strategy session. All right, so we're good to go. We can
11:47
download it. We can start from the beginning. We can listen in full. And literally all I said here, it was very creative. I just said based on the
11:53
recent updates in AI world, for example, chat 5. Give me a story board for adults that would be funny talking about the
11:59
world of AI and how bad Chachi 5 was despite us waiting 2 years for it. And
12:05
if you're good with Stephen in the comments, he might even send you a video of him dancing at a Goldie Agency Poland
12:12
get together that was absolutely legendary recently. All right, so we're going to kick this back off now. We've
12:17
basically got Gemini creating storyboards. It's really good at creating personalized conversations. It
12:24
creates these guided learning modes and it's very good at generating images. What other AI in the world can do this?
12:31
Tell me. Literally just tell me one AI in the world that can do this apart from Gemini because the image quality is
12:36
topnotch. You might get good outputs from Claude but you won't get good image quality. You could use chat GPT5 but can
12:44
you create animated storyboards on chat GPT5? No. And everyone feels quite let down by it I think just in general. And
12:51
then also you can create these quick SAS tools I call them. Like for example we can say here create an app about keyword
12:56
research for SEO and then boom shack lacker. We can get that right here. So if we click on get suggestions, we've
13:02
got all these keyword suggestions. We just built out a keyword tool that's actually sharable with people. And then
13:08
we've got a bunch of keyword ideas here, right? And it was all just created in one shot. Looks really nice. And so you
13:14
can see the power of Gemini. Like honestly, if I had to focus on one single if I said who's going to win out
13:19
of all the AI options out there, who's going to win? I would genuinely say Google are probably leading the race. If
13:24
you look at what for example chat are doing, they rely heavily on marketing, right? They got someone amazing like a
13:30
frontman Sam W Mortman and he's a great frontman for the brand but at the same time if they didn't have that marketing
13:36
then it would be a struggle right if you go back to Google now as well let's just check yeah Google absolutely smashing it
13:41
right if you look at their growth over the last year or so they're absolutely flying they seem to be making very good
13:48
moves in the industry in general right don't bear in mind as well they got stuff like nobook LM they've got stuff
13:53
like for example Google jewels they got Google CLI etc So, it's really powerful
13:59
stuff. Aaron says, "Google is too censored. Church is less restrict." It depends what you're doing with it,
14:04
right? For me, I don't really have anything that would be going against their guidelines. So, I guess I just
14:09
don't come across that, but it depends what industry you're in, right? Depends what dodgy stuff you're doing on there. And Abdul says, "Please tell me how to
14:15
use it shortly. Then I will see the live afterwards." All right. All right. So if you want to do this, all you do is you go to Gemini and then you know you say
14:22
okay create a storyboard about and then you just type in whatever the storyboard is about. Right? So let's say for
14:28
example SEO is dead because chat GPT came along and destroyed it. But we're
14:35
happy now because actually people search more than ever. Actually, I'm going to use link whisper flow for this more than
14:40
ever because AI search is growing every day as people get addicted to searching in there and because they can actually
14:46
get better responses in Google. All right. By the way, if you're wondering what I just use for that's whisper flow. So, we're going to say create a
14:51
storyboard for that. That should toggle it on. And then let's see if that triggers automatically or if I have to
14:56
click one of the options. I think we're going to be good to go on that. It's generating an image, but I can't see a story board. Let's go back to story
15:03
book. A story book. All right. So, we have to do it in here. We just say okay create a story book and then that should
15:09
toggle it on. All right so just to recap for the steps you go up to gems you go up to story book you say create a story
15:15
book about whatever you want and then it will start creating that right and goes off and does that bad boy. What else we got here? So Veil 3 says I think Veo3 is
15:23
supported in Gemini Studio. Can we convert the story book in video? As far as I'm aware you can't. What you can
15:29
actually do is you just get something like dscript is really good or you can use something like for example
15:36
streamlabs. You just record your screen. Even Loom would probably do the job. And then from there all you would do is you
15:42
would just go back to the story book that we create. So like this one. And then once that's done just record your screen whilst you're playing it, right?
15:48
And play it full screen. And then that's problem solved, right? You got the Google file ready to go. User X says, can you please talk about batch
15:55
processing and scalability? how we can scale this type of applications. Yeah, you can use something like NA10, right?
16:01
Just keeping it really simple, but if you want to keep this stuff simple, I I assume if you want to scale applications, you can use something like
16:07
NA10. It's really easy to just scale stuff and have it working on a repetitive loop with the API. The other
16:13
option that you have, right, let's say, for example, with batch scaling, you're talking about clawed. So, you can use clawed code for that. I'm not going to
16:20
get too much into it because it goes way outside the scope of this live stream, this video, but yeah, feel free to jump
16:25
in the AR profit boardroom if you want more help on that. Right, if you go to the calendar here, we actually do five coaching calls a week. So, you can just
16:31
jump on the coaching calls, ask us any questions live. If you can't make it, you can ask questions inside the community and that sort of thing as
16:37
well. Let's see what we got. What else we got here? Google's prototype team is really good. The quality of AI products
16:42
they are releasing is really useful. I'd 100% agree with that. Right. Bear in mind like we're only looking at the
16:48
front end of Gemini. But if you go to AI Studio, it's redonkulous what else you can do with it, right? So for example,
16:54
if you go inside AI Studio here, you can stream your screen in real time and just speak to the AI like what other AI can
17:01
do that right now, right on the desktop. You can also, for example, generate media. You can, for example, build
17:07
stuff. So you can build apps directly with Gemini here. And there's all these different apps that you can actually just test if you just want to have a go
17:13
at something that's already pre-made and you're not sure what you're doing. And then also, yeah, you've got the build and the stream section. Let's go on the
17:19
stream section here. So, if we go to share screen, and I'm just going to go to share screen here. We share screen,
17:24
too. What's cracker lacking, my friend? Not much. Just hanging out. Okay, great. So, I'm going to go into
17:30
Google Gemini. Could you give me an idea for an SEO app that we could build? Sure. How about an app that analyzes
17:37
website content for SEO optimization? And all right, so you get the point. It was a little bit laggy there. I think it's
17:42
cuz I'm live streaming, but you get the point. Like you can just ask it to come up with SEO optimization tips and then
17:48
whatever. It's good to go. All right, living the dream right there. And then user X says, I was working on a master
17:54
data management project for an industry. The problem is scalability and even if we do batch processing, we still lose a
17:59
lot of context. Any suggestions, please? It goes way outside the scope of this. But I would just look more into batch
18:04
processing and how you can do it. There's another way you can actually get the costs of for example claude down as well. But also bear in mind all these
18:11
apps are all these APIs are upgrading in terms of their context windows. So for example claude this week increased its
18:17
context window by 1 million, right? So it went from 200k to 1 million. Then you also got for example Google Gemini
18:23
that's 1 million context window. And to be honest like they probably give it the next update. Who knows what Google 3.0
18:29
is going to be like. Google Gemini 3.0. It's going to be absolutely crazy. Sarang says there's a print error when
18:35
it doesn't print. Okay. And then DT says, "Yo, this screen share feature is really solve a painoint for a lot of
18:41
people." Yeah. And crazy thing about this is that nobody even knows about it or even really understands how to use it
18:47
properly, but it's an absolute game changer. So now we're going to listen to The Owl and the Firefly by Julian Goldie
18:54
SEO apparently. Now if we click on print, let's have a look here. Will it print or not? So you can see it's loading the bar right there. Just coming
19:00
back to question. It's preparing it. Is it going to break or is it not? It did something. It didn't download it. Let's
19:06
click on print again. Yeah, you might be right there. Doesn't there might be a bug, but bear in mind it's like it's relatively new. Fair enough. So let's
19:13
play this now. The owl and the firefly. In the heart of the big bustling city of Wabopoulos
19:19
lived an old owl named Silus. From his perch high at top the great library, he
19:25
had watched the city grow. For years, everyone came to Silas for answers. He
19:30
knew all the secret paths and hidden alleys of Obopouolis, the best keywords to whisper to get the best results. He
19:37
was the master of search engine optimization, or SEO for short. Then one
19:43
day, a new light appeared in Wopoulos. It was Sparky, a tiny firefly who zipped
19:48
and zoomed through the city streets, leaving a trail of brilliant light. Sparky didn't know the old paths. He
19:54
made new ones. He didn't whisper keywords. He had conversations. He was an AI and he was changing everything.
20:02
Soon the crowds the Just coming back to this. So Abdul says, "What is this about? How can we use the
20:07
storyboard?" So essentially what you can do with the storyboard is you can create like interactive storyboards to learn
20:13
about stuff. A lot of people for example quite a few people inside the air are profitable born and have asked like how can you create comics or how can you
20:19
create books etc. And this is one of the best ways to do it. One of the easiest ways to do it. And essentially what this
20:25
book is about. This is more honestly this is more like a I would say it feels more like a kids story to be honest. If
20:31
I go back let's X off that. Yeah. So we said create a story book about SEO instead blah blah blah. I think it's
20:36
created more like a kids style story but you could ask it for an adult story as well. So for example then you can come
20:43
up with a bunch of ideas like all right. So if we go to recent as well. So you can see recent and then we can listen back to this one. User X says, "Can you
20:50
talk about image recognition and video recognition capabilities of Gemini multimodal capabilities?" Everyone talks
20:55
about image and video generation real world industry. Yeah. So, so what you can do for example when when you're looking at for example like video
21:02
generation, right? Video generation is really cool because you can create if we go back here if I click on let's see
21:08
what we got video right and you can actually add a v photo. So you can actually animate yourself as well. Let's
21:14
pull up a photo of me and then we can actually use that to generate a video. So bear with me folks. I've downloaded a
21:19
photo and then we can upload that for consistency into Gemini. All right. So we're going to upload a photo now. Let's
21:25
take that picture. And then from here we're going to say, right, okay, create a video of this man telling a funny joke
21:35
and then flying into the sky. Something like that. So we're taking that picture. And the reason that it's pretty good for
21:41
uploading the picture is you can basically create character consistency. So previously if you were generating a
21:47
video every time you asked it to generate say image of a man it would be like a different man every time or even
21:52
if you were very specific with the description it would change every time. With this process instead you're going to have the same character inside each
22:00
video that you generate. Right? And so now we can generate the video. This is using BO3 which is by far one of the
22:06
best ways to do this. And then also if we went back to let's start another chat on the side right we went back to
22:12
another chat here and then we took an image right so we'll upload an image we'll say okay based on that multimodal
22:19
capability that image recognition for example we'll say describe this person and then it should start analyzing that
22:25
picture and analyzing me as a person so just and this is the other cool thing as well is you can do this in different
22:31
tabs so you can have all of this running at the same time and because it's in Chrome it's not going to cost you memory
22:36
or anything like that right it's just running in the background. So, it now basically explains what I'm wearing, who
22:41
the man is. Man's wearing a watch, whatever. Short brown textured hair, subtle highlights, defined jawline, and
22:47
prominent cheekbones. I like that description. It's very, it's being very like complimentary today. And then we
22:53
have the clothing, everything else, right? So, that's super easy to do. So, you can use that directly here. Now, if
22:58
you go back here, now we've got the video. I don't know if this is going to work, but let's test it out because I did stretch it quite far with the
23:04
description, but let's see what we get back. Why don't scientists trust Adams? Because they make up everything.
23:10
All right, so that's basically how you can animate a image. Obviously, the flying into the skyline didn't work, but
23:16
I think that was just stretching it a bit too far. You can see exactly how to use this and how easy this is, right?
23:22
So, let's see what else we got here. DT Workspace says, I used Gemini mobile app with Gemini camera feature in real life.
23:28
No need to type in chat window to ask any question. just use camera and get the solution. Google product team solving real used problems. Yeah, 100%
23:35
100%. Actually, like I was booking a flight before and I had a picture of the passport and I had this really long form
23:40
that I had to fill in. I had to grab all the individual details from the passport picture and then type it into the form.
23:46
I was like, I'm not going to do that. So instead, what I actually did was I took a picture, plugged it into the app, and
23:51
then said, take those detail and put it into a copied and pasteable format for the form in the order of the form. And
23:57
it saved me a lot of admin, right? So it was way faster for that. So yeah, it was really good. He's got a lot of good options there to work with apps
24:03
marketing brainstorm. This is really gold. Use X says what benchmarks you use for comparison of the models. Honestly,
24:09
for me, like I don't trust benchmarks at all, right? Cuz as well, like it it depends how many people are using the
24:14
server. You don't know what kind of upgrades are running. If you look at chatt5 when I tested out the other day
24:20
and you'll see this on one of my videos, I ran exactly the same prompt inside Claude as chat GPT and Claude outcoded
24:28
it, right? Claude actually created an output. Chat GPT totally failed. And so the lesson there was like this AI is
24:35
maybe good on the benchmarks, but in reality when you're using it dayto-day, it's actually not as good as you think.
24:41
And Magic says Gemini or Manis. So it depends what you're doing. But honestly, like if you Here's the thing, right? If
24:47
you go on to Manis and we'll pull this up right now. So I do man, you know, it's quite good. I actually tend to use GenSpark more, but if you use Manis and
24:54
you use Gemini and we use exactly the same prompt. So we're going to say, okay, let's go back here. We'll say,
25:00
yeah, we'll say inside the canvas, okay, create a quiz about SEO, right? Just
25:05
something quick and easy like that. And we'll do the same inside manus exactly the same time. So we're going to ask them both side by side to create a quiz
25:12
about SEO, right? So what you can see here is that Gemini, if we compare these side by side, Gemini is already coding
25:17
it, right? It's already building something, which is great. Now, if you look at Manus, Manus is going to take absolutely ages cuz what it actually
25:24
does is it uses browser use and computer use to go off through the internet, start trying to figure stuff out to do,
25:31
then it's going to host it on an MD file, which weird, and then it's going to format it and deliver it, right? And let's have a look here. So this is the
25:38
quiz. Now, if you look at this quiz, it's not interactive. It's not that interesting, etc. If you look at Gemini, look at that quiz. The quiz is way
25:44
better, right? It's interactive, it's engaging, it's more fun, etc., right? And so the difference here is that
25:50
Gemini tends to create better outputs at the same speed as Manis, right? Whereas Manus, it creates something basic, then
25:56
you have to go back in chat, you give it another response, then you blast through a bunch more credits, and it gets a
26:02
little bit annoying, right? What you can do though inside, for example, inside Manis is you can do stuff that you
26:07
cannot do inside Gemini, right? For example, if we say create a 60-second video with a story about a man going to
26:13
slay a dragon in the cave, it actually created all the video files here, but then it actually sliced them together
26:18
and put it inside this video. So, they've got a 60-second video. You can't do that inside V3, right? And now, if we
26:25
pull this up, we've got the video generated right here. This was actually an old one. So, this was a conversation
26:30
from a while back, but you get the point. Like, it's quite easy to generate videos, storyboards, etc. using this
26:36
process I'm showing you today. and then you can stitch everything together, right? Whereas inside Gemini, Gemini is
26:43
not going to stitch stuff together for you directly, right? So that's one of the biggest differences here. But you get this like Game of Thrones feel for
26:50
the content that you're creating, right? And it's really easy to do. Really easy to do step by step. Says, "If you're free, you should explain explore Amazon
26:57
Bedrock. There are more than 50 LM. Yeah, I heard Amazon Bedrock is pretty good." Actually, the new Claude update
27:02
for the million tokens context window that was only available in two places. Claude Code and Amazon Bedrock. It
27:08
wasn't available anywhere else. That dude says, "What LLM will allow us to schedule an agent to dedicate a task?" I
27:14
can't remember if you can do scheduled tasks now inside Gemini. I think you might be able to. Yeah. So, you can
27:20
launch like scheduled actions it's called. I haven't actually tested that. That is interesting. So, let's say okay,
27:27
I'm going to go in here. New chat. Let's see if it's one of the options. I've never tested this out. We're going to say, okay, schedule check in AI news
27:34
every day. something like that. See if it works. But yeah, for me, I mean, for scheduling, like the best thing is
27:40
honestly like just a Google doc with your plan. That's what I do every day. Like I plan it out every 30 minutes. If
27:45
you want to get a copy of that, then you can actually go inside the AR profit volume. Just drop me a DM and I'll get that daily planner to you. But
27:51
essentially inside here, you can schedule check in different tasks here. So you can say, okay, done. I will
27:57
schedule AI news for you every day. Ask me to edit or delete the scheduled thing. You get a notification when it's ready. And then if we edit this, right,
28:04
we can actually edit the schedule, the instructions, AI news, and we can delete that task as well, right? So if you don't want that prompt to run, you can
28:11
just delete it and then boom, you're ready to go. So that's actually pretty cool. I didn't even realize Gemini could do that, so that was really cool. Which
28:17
AI system is currently the best for coding? I really love Gemini. If you're building something basic, even if you're
28:22
building something more complex, then I would say Claude or Gemini, but Gemini tends to have it's got three APIs for
28:28
coding, so you know, you can't argue with that. DT says I find Plexi the best scheduling. Dot says coding debugging.
28:34
Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah. So if you want to like debug and that sort of thing then I would recommend Claude CLI or Google
28:42
CLI. You can also use chat GPT codeex. That's pretty good for coding and that sort of thing. DT recommends cl code and
28:48
says is Gemini addin code assist similar to cl code. So you've got Gemini CLI
28:53
right? I've got a video on this inside the AR profit boardroom if you want this, but you can use Gemini CLI and
28:59
that's like an open free way to code. If you want the training on that, just go inside the AR profit boardroom, then go
29:04
to Google CRI update and we walk you through exactly like how to install it, how to set it up, etc. So, it's pretty
29:10
good. Very similar to CL code. Yeah. Cool. All right. So, let's start with the biggest update that honestly blew my
29:16
mind when I saw it. Google just rolled out a personalization feature that lets Gemini remember your past conversations.
29:22
Think about this for a second. How many times have you had to tell chat GPT or Claude the same information over and
29:27
over again? You start a new chat and you're back to explaining what your business does, what your goals are, what
29:33
your preferences are. Well, Google just solved that problem completely. Here's how it works. There's a new setting in
29:38
Gemini that when you turn it on, it remembers key details and preferences from all your previous chats. So, if you
29:44
tell it once that you run a marketing agency focused on local businesses, it remembers that forever. If you mention
29:49
you prefer short bullet point answers instead of long paragraphs, it remembers that, too. This means every conversation
29:54
gets smarter and more personalized. It's like having an AI assistant that actually knows you instead of meeting a
30:00
stranger every time you open a new chat. But here's the crazy part. This isn't just for paid users. This is rolling out
30:05
to everyone starting with the 2.5 Pro model. That's the free version of Gemini. Google is literally giving away
30:11
features that other AI companies charge premium prices for. Now, let me show you exactly how this changes everything
30:17
before this update. If I wanted help with my YouTube strategy, I'd have to explain my channel size, my niche, my
30:23
goals, my target audience, everything from scratch every single time. But now, Gemini already knows I run an SEO
30:30
agency. It knows I create AI content. It knows my subscriber count and engagement
30:35
rates. So, when I ask for YouTube ideas, it gives me suggestions that are actually relevant to my specific
30:40
situation. This is huge for business owners because now you can build a real relationship with your AI assistant. It
30:45
learns your writing style, your business model, your customer base, everything. And the more you use it, the better it gets. It's like having a business
30:52
partner that never forgets anything and gets smarter every day. But wait, there's more. Because Google also just launched something called temporary
30:58
chat. And this solves a problem that nobody was talking about, but everyone was thinking about. Sometimes you want to ask your AI assistant something
31:04
private. Maybe you're planning a surprise for someone. Maybe you're working on a confidential project. Maybe you just want to brainstorm ideas
31:10
without it affecting your main conversation history. Well, now you can. Temporary chat lets you have conversations that don't get saved
31:16
anywhere. Uh they don't show up in your recent chats. They don't get used to train the AI. They don't affect your
31:22
personalization settings. It's like having a private conversation that disappears after 72 hours. Think about
31:28
how powerful this is. You can use your main Gemini account for all your regular business stuff where you want it to remember everything, but then switch to
31:35
temporary mode when you need privacy. This gives you the best of both worlds. Personalization when you want it,
31:40
privacy when you need it. And here's something most people don't realize. This temporary chat feature isn't just about privacy. It's also perfect for
31:47
testing different approaches without messing up your main AI relationship. Want to try a completely different
31:52
writing style? Use temporary chat. Want to experiment with a new business idea without confusing your AI about your
31:58
main focus? Temporary chat. Want to ask questions about a competitor without it affecting how Gemini sees your own
32:04
business? You guess it, temporary chat. And speaking of getting the most out of AI, if you want to learn how to use
32:10
these tools to actually make money, I've got something special for you. I've put together a complete AI training program called the AI Money Lab. The link is in
32:17
the comments and description below. This covers everything from setting up these AI tools to turning them into profit
32:22
generating machines for your business. Now, let's talk about the third update that honestly surprised me the most. It's called Storybook, and it's unlike
32:29
anything I've seen before. Storybook lets you create complete illustrated stories from just a simple prompt. And I'm not talking about just text stories.
32:35
I'm talking about stories with custom images, drawings, and illustrations that match your exact vision. Here's how wild
32:42
this is. You can type something like, "Create a story about a dog who learns to code." And Gemini will generate a
32:47
full story with pictures. But here's the kicker. You can add your own photos and drawings, too. So, if you have a picture of your actual dog, you can upload it,
32:53
and Gemini will create a story featuring your real dog as the main character. Your dog becomes the hero of a custom
32:58
illustrated story. Now, you might be thinking, "This is just for fun, but let me blow your mind with the business applications here." Content creators can
33:04
use this to generate illustrated blog posts. Social media managers can create engaging story content with custom visuals. Authors can prototype their
33:11
children's books. Educators can create custom learning materials with relevant illustrations. And here's something
33:16
crazy. This works in over 45 languages. So, if you're targeting international markets, you can create story content in
33:22
Spanish, French, German, whatever language your audience speaks. But the real power is in combining all three of
33:27
these features together. Imagine this workflow. You use the personalization feature to teach Gemini about your
33:32
business and your content style. Then you use Storybook to create illustrated content that matches your brand. And when you want to experiment with
33:38
different approaches, you switch to temporary chat so it doesn't mess up your main settings. This is like having
33:44
a whole content creation team built into one AI assistant. And remember, all of this is rolling out to the free version
33:50
of Gemini. Google is basically giving away what will cost hundreds of dollars per month with other AI platforms. But
33:56
here's what most people are going to miss. These aren't just individual features. They're building blocks for a
34:01
completely new way of working with AI. The personalization means your AI gets smarter over time. The temporary chat
34:07
means you can experiment without consequences. And storybook means you can create rich multimedia content
34:12
without needing design skills. Put them together and you have an AI assistant that knows you personally, protects your
34:18
privacy when needed, and can create professional content in minutes. Now, let me share some specific ways you can
34:23
use these features starting today. For the personalization feature, start by having a conversation where you explain
34:29
your business model, your goals, and your preferences. Be specific. Tell it exactly how you like information
34:34
presented, what your target audience looks like, what your biggest challenges are. The more detail you give it up front, the better every future
34:40
conversation will be. Think of it as training your personal AI assistant. For temporary chat, use it anytime you're
34:45
working on something confidential, planning a product launch, temporary chat, researching competitors, temporary
34:50
chat, testing new marketing angles, temporary chat. And for storybook, start thinking beyond just stories. This is a
34:58
content creation tool disguised as a storytelling feature. You can create illustrated tutorials, visual case
35:03
studies, engaging social media content, whatever your business needs. Here's a concrete example. Let's say you run a
35:09
fitness business. You could use Storybook to create an illustrated guide showing a client's transformation journey. Upload before and after photos
35:16
and let Gemini create a motivational story around that transformation. Or if you're in real estate, create
35:21
illustrated stories about families finding their dream homes. Use actual property photos and let Gemini weave
35:26
them into compelling narratives. The possibilities are endless once you start thinking creatively. But here's the
35:32
thing that excites me most about these updates. Google isn't just adding features. They're reimagining what AI
35:38
assistance should look like. Most AI tools treat every conversation like you're starting from zero. But that's
35:44
not how human relationships work. When you work with a real assistant, they remember what you told them yesterday. They understand your preferences. They
35:51
know your business. Now AI is finally catching up to that reality. And the timing couldn't be better. We're in the
35:56
middle of an AI revolution where every business needs to figure out how to use these tools effectively. The companies
36:02
that master AI assistants will have a massive advantage over those that don't. These new Gemini features give you that
36:07
advantage for free. Now, I want to address something important. Some people are worried about AI remembering their conversations. They think it's creepy or
36:14
invasive. But here's the reality. You're in complete control. The personalization feature is optional. You can turn it off
36:20
anytime. And with temporary chat, you can have private conversations whenever you want. This isn't about giving up
36:25
privacy. It's about having choice. You choose when to share information and when to keep things private. And the
36:31
benefits far outweigh any concerns. Having an AI that knows your business context means better suggestions, more
36:36
relevant ideas, and faster results. Instead of spending time explaining the same things over and over, you can focus
36:42
on getting actual work done. Here's something else that's important. These features work together to solve different problems you face throughout
36:48
your day. Morning planning session where you want personalized suggestions based on your goals. Use the regular
36:53
personalized mode. Midday brainstorming session about a confidential project. Switch to temporary chat. Afternoon
37:00
content creation where you need illustrated materials. Fire up story book. It's like having three different
37:05
AI assistants optimized for different types of work. And because it's all in one platform, you don't need to learn multiple tools or pay for multiple
37:12
subscriptions. Now, let me talk about what this means for the future. Google is clearly positioning Gemini as more
37:17
than just a chatbot. They're building a comprehensive AI workplace assistant. These three features are just the
37:23
beginning. I expect we'll see integration with Google Workspace tools, advanced project management features,
37:28
and even more sophisticated personalization options. The companies that start mastering these tools now will be way ahead when the next wave of
37:34
features drops. But you don't need to wait for future updates to get value. These three features available right now
37:40
can transform how you work. Start with the personalization feature. Spend 30 minutes having a detailed conversation
37:45
with Gemini about your business. Tell it everything. Your industry, your customers, your goals, your challenges,
37:50
your preferred communication style. Then start using it for your daily tasks and watch how much better the responses get.
37:56
When you need privacy, switch to temporary chat. When you need illustrated content, use Storybook. It's that simple. Here's what happened when I
38:02
put these three AI giants to the test. I gave them all the exact same challenge. Build me five different games. Same
38:09
rules, same time limit, same everything. The question everyone's asking is simple. Which AI is actually better?
38:16
GPT5 just dropped. Claude Opus 4.1 is making waves. And Gemini 2.5 Pro claims
38:22
to be the smartest yet. But here's the thing. Everyone talks about these AES. Nobody actually tests them properly. So
38:29
I did what nobody else would do. I put them through real challenges, not simple questions, not basic tasks. Real work
38:36
that matters. What I found will change how you think about AI forever. Let me start with the first test. I asked all
38:42
three A's to build a game called Pixel Ninja Dash. The goal was simple. Create a single page app where you dash and
38:49
jump across rooftops while slicing enemy robots. Sounds easy, right? Wrong.
38:54
Here's what happened. Gemini finished first. The UI looked good, but the game was so hard to play, I wanted to throw
39:01
my computer out the window. GPT5 came second. Again, nice UI, but just like
39:06
Gemini, way too hard to actually enjoy. Then Claude Opus 4.1 finished last. Uh,
39:12
but here's the twist. The game was actually fun to play. Easy controls, nice night city lights, cute background.
39:18
While the other two made games that looked good but felt terrible, Claude made something you'd actually want to play. This tells us something important.
39:25
Speed doesn't always win. Pretty doesn't always work. Sometimes the AI that takes longer makes something better. But wait,
39:31
it gets more interesting. Test two was candy match blast. Match three candies. Score points. Beat the clock. Standard
39:38
match three game that everyone knows. Gemini finished first again. But there was an error. The game didn't work. So
39:45
while I waited for Gemini to fix it, Claude finished. And holy cow, instead of regular candy graphics, Claude used
39:51
emojis, chocolates, candies, sweets. It looked completely different from what the others made. GPT5 finished next. The
40:00
design was like painted balls. Pretty and polished. It worked well. Finally, Gemini fixed its error and came last.
40:06
When it finally worked, I wasn't impressed. The design was boring compared to the others. Claude won this round. Not because it was fastest,
40:13
because it was creative. It thought outside the box. It made something unique while the others played it safe.
40:18
This is where most people get AI wrong. They think faster means better. They think first place means best. But what
40:24
actually matters is results. What matters is whether the thing you ask for
40:29
actually works the way you need it to. Test three was jungle run adventure. Run
40:35
and jump across jungle platforms. Collect bananas. Avoid traps. Infinite
40:41
terrain that gets faster as you play. Here's where things got messy. All three AIs failed on the first try. Every
40:47
single one had errors. So, I gave them all a second chance. Claude finished first this time. The game design looked
40:52
good, but there were no bananas, no collectibles, just a monkey running. I gave it another chance. The second
40:59
version didn't work at all. Gemini came next. It worked most of the time, but sometimes the space bar didn't respond.
41:04
Sometimes you couldn't jump. And instead of bananas, it made yellow balls. I'm not kidding. Yellow balls instead of
41:10
bananas. GPT5 came last. The game crashed completely three times. It just
41:15
couldn't handle this challenge at all. This test showed me something crucial. When AIs fail, they fail differently.
41:21
Some fail fast and recover. Some fail slow but work eventually. Some just keep
41:26
failing no matter what you do. But here's what's really happening behind the scenes. Each AI has different
41:32
strengths, different ways of thinking about problems, different approaches to code. And here's where you need to pay
41:38
attention because the next test changed everything. Test four was Space Miner
41:44
3D. Fly a spaceship through asteroids. Collect crystals. Don't crash. Use 3.js
41:49
JS for 3D graphics. Gemini finished first. Nothing special. Standard game. GPT5 came second. Also nothing special.
41:57
Same basic approach. But Claude came last. At first it showed errors. I thought it failed again. But then I
42:03
realized something. The game was actually working and it looked way better than the other two. Despite the initial errors, Claude had built
42:09
something more impressive. This taught me the biggest lesson of all. Don't judge an AI by its first response. Don't
42:15
judge it by how fast it works. Judge it by the final result. You know what? Most business owners get wrong about AI. They
42:21
pick the AI that gives them answers fastest. They want quick results, fast responses, instant gratification. But
42:28
that's like choosing a restaurant because they serve food fast. Speed doesn't mean quality. Speed doesn't mean
42:34
the food tastes good. Speed doesn't mean you'll be satisfied. The same is true with AI. The best AI isn't always the
42:40
fastest AI. Now, here's where you can transform your business with AI. Most people use AI wrong. They ask simple
42:47
questions. They want quick answers. They treat AI like a search engine. That's like buying a Ferrari and only driving
42:54
it to the grocery store. The real power of AI comes when you push it. When you give it complex challenges, when you
42:59
test its limits. And that's exactly what the AI success lab teaches you. How to use AI the right way. How to get results
43:06
that actually matter. How to save hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars with the right AI strategies.
43:12
Check the link in the comments and description. Over 14,000 members are already inside learning the advanced
43:17
techniques that most people never discover. But let me finish the story first because test 5 was the real eye
43:24
opener. Test 5 was Lava Escape Runner. Run across crumbling platforms while lava rises from below. Volcanic theme,
43:31
fiery colors, intense but not frustrating gameplay. Gemini finished first again, but guess what? Error
43:38
again. So I gave it time to fix it. Claude came second. The game worked. Sometimes the controls didn't respond
43:44
perfectly, but it was playable. It was fun. GPT5 came last, and this is where
43:50
it completely fell apart. Error after error after error, three times in a row, it just couldn't handle this challenge.
43:56
So, what does all this mean? Which AI actually wins? Here's the truth. There is no single winner. Each AI has
44:02
different strengths. Gemini is fast, but makes more errors. GPT5 is polished, but
44:08
struggles with complex tasks. Claude is creative and often builds better final products, even if it takes longer. But
44:14
here's what really matters for your business. You need to know which AI to use for which task. For quick, simple
44:19
tasks, Gemini might be your best bet. For polished standard work, GPT5 could work well. For creative, complex
44:26
projects, Claude often surprises you with something better. Most people don't know this. They pick one AI and stick
44:32
with it. That's like using a hammer for every job. Sometimes you need a screwdriver. Sometimes you need a saw.
44:37
The businesses that are winning with AI right now understand this. They use different AIs for different purposes.
44:44
They know when to use which tool. And that's exactly what we teach inside the AI success lab. Not just how to use one
44:50
AI, but how to use all of them. How to pick the right tool for each job. How to get results that your competitors can't
44:56
match. You see how I show a checklist of 100 different tutorials that were given away as freebies every day inside the
45:02
school feed. That's just the beginning. You get all the video notes, all the strategies, all the techniques that took
45:09
me years to figure out. Plus, you join 14,000 other members who are all learning and sharing the latest AI
45:15
breakthroughs. When you're part of something bigger than yourself, you learn faster. You grow faster. You get
45:21
results faster. Here's what this really means for you. AI isn't just about getting quick answers anymore. It's
45:26
about building systems, creating processes, automating tasks that used to take hours. The companies that figure
45:32
this out first will dominate their markets. The ones that don't will be left behind. I've seen it happen
45:38
already. Businesses that used to spend thousands on content creation now do it for pennies. Companies that used to hire
45:44
expensive developers now build apps with AI. Entrepreneurs who used to struggle with marketing now create campaigns that
45:50
convert like crazy, but only if they know how to use AI properly. I decided
45:55
to run the ultimate test. Four of the most powerful AI models on the planet all fighting for one thing. The title of
46:01
best AI coder. We've got Quen 3-235B- A22B-2507.
46:09
This is Alibaba's brand new monster. Just dropped and it's already making waves. This thing is their latest coding
46:17
powerhouse that's designed to compete with the best. Then we have Claude for Opus Anthropics coding beast. They claim
46:24
it's the world's best coding model. It can code for 7 hours straight without stopping. That's like having a developer
46:30
who never gets tired. Next up is Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google's latest and greatest.
46:36
This model is supposed to be revolutionary. Google says it can handle any coding challenge you throw at it.
46:41
And finally, Gro 4. This is the wild card. It's got that X factor that might surprise everyone. Here's the thing,
46:47
though. Everyone talks about which AI is best, but nobody runs real tests. They just look at benchmarks. But benchmarks
46:54
don't tell the whole story. You need real world challenges. So I created seven brutal tests. These
47:01
aren't simple coding tasks. These are the kind of projects that separate the winners from the losers. Let me tell you
47:07
about test number one. HTML game with falling objects clicker. Here's the exact prompt I gave each AI. Build a
47:14
simple HTML and JavaScript game where objects fall from the top of the screen and the player has to click them before
47:20
they hit the ground. The game should include a start screen, score tracking, increasing difficulty over time, and
47:26
work well on both desktop and mobile. I asked each AI to build a complete game, not just some basic code, a real game
47:33
with all these features. This is where things got interesting. Gemini came out swinging, super fast response. The game
47:40
actually worked. You could play it right away. No bugs, no crashes, just pure gaming goodness. Quen 3 coder was next.
47:47
Built almost the same game. Pretty solid stuff. The mechanics worked great. Grock 4 followed with similar output. Nothing
47:54
groundbreaking, but it did the job. But here's the twist. Claude 4 Opus was last
47:59
to finish, but when I saw the UI, my jaw dropped. It was completely different from the others. Better design, cleaner
48:05
interface, more professional looking. So, round one goes to Gemini for speed and functionality. But Claude gets style
48:12
points. Test number two was brutal. A it tool landing page. The prompt was,
48:17
"Create a clean, modern landing page using only HTML and CSS for a fictional AI tool called Prompt Pilot. It should
48:24
include a catchy headline, sub headline, hero, image, placeholder, a section with three features using icons, a
48:31
testimonial carousel, and a bold animated call to action button. I wanted a complete landing page for this fake AI
48:37
tool. Had to be modern, clean with all these specific elements. Gemini strikes
48:43
again, first to finish, the landing page looks amazing. Great font combinations, professional design. This thing could
48:49
fool anyone into thinking it was a real product. Quen came next, but the page was super plain. The text color was so
48:55
light you could barely see it. Major fail on the user experience front. Grock 4 delivered something basic, not
49:00
impressive. Looked like a landing page from 2015. Claude 4 Opus came last again, but wow,
49:06
the UI was gorgeous. Perfect color choices, professional layout. If I was running a real AI company, I'd use this
49:12
design. Here's what I'm seeing. Gemini is fast and functional. Claude is slow but beautiful. Quen 3-235B-
49:20
A22B-2507 is hit or miss. Grock is basic. Test
49:26
three changed everything. Multiplayer tic-tac-toe in the browser. Here's the prompt I used. Build a two-player
49:32
tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that works in real time via websockets or a similar method. It
49:38
should allow two users to play from different browsers with automatic wind detection and a restart option. This
49:44
wasn't just any tic-tac-toe game. This had to work in real time. Two players in different browsers, websocket
49:50
connections, wind detection, restart options. This is advanced stuff. Plot
49:56
twist. Quen 3-235B- A 22B-2507
50:02
finish first. And the game actually worked. Nice UI, smooth gameplay, everything functioned perfectly. Claude
50:08
came second, good UI, working game, solid performance. Grock 4 was supposed to deliver a game, but when I checked,
50:15
there was no game. Complete failure. Gemini came last with a working game, but the UI looked terrible. Functional,
50:21
but ugly. This is where Quen 3-235B- A22B-2507
50:27
showed its true power. When it comes to complex interactive applications, it's a beast. Test four was the browserbased
50:34
markdown editor. The prompt make a browserbased markdown editor using HTML,
50:39
CSS, and JavaScript. The page should have a split screen layout with a markdown input on the left and a live
50:45
preview on the right. Include buttons for bold, italic, and links, and allow the user to export the content as a MD
50:51
file. Split screen layout, live preview, export functionality. This is developer
50:57
tool territory. Quen finish first. But here's the problem. When I tried to preview anything, it threw errors. I
51:03
tried to fix it, but the errors kept coming. Total disaster. Gemini came next with a working Markdown editor. Clean,
51:10
functional, did exactly what it was supposed to do. Grock and Claude both built editors. But when you tried to
51:15
pace basic HTML, neither would preview it properly. Both failed the real world test. So Gemini takes this round for
51:22
actually delivering something that works. Here's where things get crazy. Test five was portfolio website
51:27
generator. My prompt was build a simple web tool where a user can enter their name, skills, and project descriptions.
51:34
And when they click a generate button, it creates a styled onepage portfolio website, include an option to download
51:39
the generated HTML file. I wanted a tool where users could enter their info, click generate, and boom, a complete
51:47
portfolio website appears, plus the ability to download the HTML file. Jim and I finished first with a nice UI, but
51:54
it had a fatal flaw. It didn't respond to user input. Beautiful, but broken.
52:00
Quen had errors again. Starting to see a pattern here. Claude delivered something special. Good UI, working buttons,
52:06
responsive design. Actually did the job it was supposed to do. Grock had the same functionality as Claude, but the UI
52:12
looked basic. Still worked though. Claude wins this round for delivering both form and function. Test six blew my
52:18
mind. Tower defense game. Here's the prompt. Create a simple 2D tower defense game using HTML 5 canvas and JavaScript
52:26
where enemies follow a path and the player places towers to stop them. Include waves of increasing difficulty,
52:33
basic tower upgrades, and a game over screen. This isn't just a game. This is
52:38
a complete 2D tower defense system. Enemies following paths, towers that shoot, waves of increasing difficulty,
52:44
tower upgrades, game over screens. This is serious game development. Quen
52:50
finished first, but I couldn't figure out how to play the game. The UI was confusing. The mechanics weren't clear. It technically worked, but was unusable.
52:57
Then Gemini delivered something incredible. This felt like a real game. Professional fonts, smooth mechanics,
53:03
perfect UI. It was like playing a game from the app store. Absolutely insane for just one prompt. Gro's game didn't
53:09
work properly. Major disappointment. Claw did the job, but it could use improvement. Functional, but not
53:15
impressive. Gemini completely destroyed the competition here. No contest. Test seven was the ultimate challenge. First
53:21
person maze escape 3D game. The final prompt. Create a basic firstperson 3D
53:26
maze escape game in the browser using 3JS. The player should be able to move through a 3D maze using keyboard
53:33
controls WD. Find a key and unlock an exit door to win. I wanted a full 3D
53:39
maze game using 3JS. First person perspective keyboard controls with WD.
53:45
Find a key, unlock an exit door. win the game. This is professional game development territory. Gemini was
53:52
incredible. Created a full 3D maze that actually worked. You could move around, find the key, escape through the door.
53:58
It felt like playing a real video game. Quen showed just a brown background. No interaction. Complete failure. Claude
54:04
impressed me. Built a working 3D maze. You could navigate through it, find objectives, escape to win. Really solid
54:11
implementation. Grock just showed a white background. Another complete failure. Gemini wins again with the most
54:17
impressive 3D game. So, let's talk about what this all means. After running seven brutal tests, here's what I discovered.
54:23
Gemini 2.5 Pro is the speed demon. Fast responses, great UI design. When it
54:30
works, it really works. Especially impressive with games and visual applications. Claude for Opus is the
54:37
perfectionist. takes longer to respond but delivers higher quality code, better UI designs, more professionallook
54:44
results. When you need something that looks good and works well, Claude delivers. Quen 3-235B-
54:51
A22B-2507 is the wild card. Sometimes it's brilliant. The multiplayer tic-tac-toe
54:57
was amazing, but sometimes it fails completely. Inconsistent, but has moments of genius. Grock 4 is the
55:03
underdog. Basic, but functional most of the time. Not exciting, but gets the job done for simple projects. Here's the
55:09
thing, though. The winner depends on what you need. If you want speed and impressive visual results, Gemini is
55:15
your choice. It's perfect for prototypes and demos that need to wow people. If you want professional quality code that
55:22
looks good and works reliably, Claude for Opus is the winner. Yes, it's slower, but the results are worth
55:29
waiting for. If you're feeling adventurous and want to try something with huge potential, Quen 3-235B-
55:36
A22B-2507 might surprise you. Just be prepared for some inconsistency. And if you need
55:42
something basic that just works, Gro 4 will do the job. But here's the real secret. The best coders don't rely on
55:48
just one AI. They use multiple models for different tasks. Use Gemini for rapid prototyping and visual
55:55
applications. Use Claude for production code that needs to be professional. Use Quen 3-235B-
56:01
A22B-2507 when you want to experiment with cuttingedge capabilities. I decided to
56:06
run the ultimate test. Four of the most powerful AI models on the planet. All fighting for one thing, the title of
56:13
best AI coder. We've got Quen 3-2 35B- A22B-2507.
56:20
This is Alibaba's brand new monster just dropped and it's already making waves. This thing is their latest coding
56:28
powerhouse that's designed to compete with the best. Then we have Claude for Opus, Anthropics coding beast. They
56:35
claim it's the world's best coding model. It can code for 7 hours straight without stopping. That's like having a

56:46
greatest. This model is supposed to be revolutionary. Google says it can handle any coding challenge you throw at it.
56:53
And finally, Gro 4. This is the wild card. It's got that X factor that might surprise everyone. Here's the thing,
56:58
though. Everyone talks about which AI is best, but nobody runs real tests. They just look at benchmarks, but benchmarks
57:05

59:18
the UI was gorgeous. Perfect color choices, professional layout. If I was running a real AI company, I'd use this
59:24
design. Here's what I'm seeing. Gemini is fast and functional. Claude is slow but beautiful. Quen 3-235B-

1:00:51

1:00:57

file. Split screen layout live preview export functionality. This is developer
1:01:08
tool territory. Quen finish first. But here's the problem. When I tried to preview anything, it threw errors. I
1:01:15
tried to fix it, but the errors kept coming. Total disaster. Gemini came next with a working Markdown editor. Clean,
1:01:21

1:06:06
applications. Use Claude for production code that needs to be professional. Use Quen 3-235B-
1:06:12
A22B-2507 when you want to experiment with cuttingedge capabilities. Everyone's
1:06:18
talking about which AI is best, but nobody's actually testing them on real business tasks. Everyone just asks them
1:06:25
to write a poem or solve a math problem. and that's useless. So, I decided to do something different. I created five
1:06:31
brutal business tests, real tasks that you and I face every single day. SEO analysis, content creation, strategic
1:06:38
planning, the works, and I put three of the hottest AI models through the ringer, Grock 4, Claude for Sonnet, and
1:06:46
Gemini 2.5 Pro. What I found will change how you think about AI forever. Let me
1:06:51
break this down for you. First, let me tell you about the testing method because this wasn't some casual
1:06:57
comparison. This was scientific. This was real. I created five different business scenarios. Each one designed to
1:07:03
test a different skill that matters in business. Researchability, content creation, strategic thinking, technical
1:07:09
knowledge, speed. Every test had clear evaluation criteria. I measured speed. I
1:07:15
measured accuracy. I measured quality. And I scored everything on a point system so there was no bias. And I'm
1:07:21
going to share the exact prompts I used. So you can test these yourself. You can see if you get the same results. You can
1:07:26
use these prompts in your own business. Test one was SEO competitive analysis. This is something I do every single day
1:07:33
in my agency. I gave each AI model a scenario where they're running a project management software company. They had to
1:07:39
analyze competitors like Asana and Monday.com, find keyword opportunities, identify content gaps, create a
1:07:46
six-month strategy. Here's the exact prompt I used. I run a midsize SAS company selling project management
1:07:53
software. Our main competitors are Asana, Monday.com, and Trello. Create a
1:07:58
comprehensive SEO competitive analysis that includes one, identify 10 highv value keyword opportunities where we
1:08:04
could outrank these competitors. Two, analyze their content gaps we could exploit. Three, recommend a six-month
1:08:11
SEO strategy with specific tactics and expected timeline for results. Include reasoning for your recommendations. This
1:08:19
is complex stuff. This requires research skills, strategic thinking, business
1:08:24
understanding. And here's what happened. Grock 4 absolutely crushed this test. It delivered the most comprehensive report
1:08:31
I've ever seen from an AI. Detailed tables, extensive data analysis, strategic insights that actually made
1:08:37
sense. The organization was perfect. The visual presentation was clean. Claude the fourth Sonic came in second. Strong
1:08:45
analytical depth, good strategic recommendations. well structured but just not as comprehensive as Grock.
1:08:50
Gemini 2.5 Pro. It was the fastest by far, but the analysis was basic, surface level, and not enough depth for real
1:08:58
strategic decision-making. So, after test one, Grock was leading. Test two was content creation. I asked each AI to
1:09:04
write a complete 1,500word blog post for uh cyber security company. Target
1:09:10
keyword was endpoint security best practices 2025. had to include SEO
1:09:15
optimization, proper heading structure, actionable advice, internal linking
1:09:21
opportunities, a compelling call to action. Here's the exact prompt. Write a complete 1,500word
1:09:28
blog post for our B2B cyber security company targeting IT directors at midsize companies with 500 to 2,000
1:09:35
employees. Primary keyword endpoint security best practices 2025 include one
1:09:43
SEO optimized title and meta description. Two, proper heading structure H1 to H3. Three, five
1:09:50
actionable best practices with real world examples. Four, internal linking opportunities suggest. Three, five, a
1:09:56
compelling CTA for our endpoint security audit. Make it authoritative but accessible avoiding technical jargon.
1:10:02
This is bread and butter content marketing something every business needs. and Claude Forson on it destroyed this test. It delivered 1,620
1:10:10
words of absolutely beautiful content. The SEO optimization was perfect.
1:10:15
Natural keyword integration. The structure was clean. The readability was incredible. It felt like a human expert
1:10:20
wrote it. Gemini 2.5 Pro came in second with 1,529 words. Good content quality, proper SEO
1:10:28
elements, solid performance across the board. But here's where things got interesting. Gro 4 had a massive
1:10:35
problem. It claimed it wrote 1,512 words, but when I counted only 1,221
1:10:42
words. That's a huge accuracy issue. You can't trust an AI that lies about word count. What else is it lying about? So,
1:10:49
after test two, Claude was catching up. Test three was content repurposing. I I
1:10:54
gave them a high performing blog post about remote team management. 3,000 words that generated 15,000 organic
1:11:01
views and 200 leads. Real numbers from real campaigns. I asked them to turn
1:11:06
this into eight different content formats. LinkedIn carousel, email newsletter series, Twitter thread,
1:11:13
YouTube script, infographic outline, podcast brief, Instagram stories, short
1:11:18
form video script. Here's the exact prompt. We have a high-erforming 30,000word blog post about remote team
1:11:24
management strategies that generated 15,000 organic views and 200 leads. Transform this single piece into eight
1:11:30
different content formats for maximum reach. One, LinkedIn carousel post. Two, email newsletter series. Three-part.
1:11:37
Three, Twitter thread. Four, YouTube video script 8 to 10 minutes. Five,
1:11:42
infographic outline. Six, podcast episode brief. Seven, Instagram story series. Eight short form video script 60
1:11:49
seconds. Provide the actual content scripts, not just ideas. This tests
1:11:54
creativity adaptation skills, platform understanding. Claude for Sonic won again, and it wasn't even close. The
1:12:00
copyrightiting was exceptional. The hooks were incredible. Each piece of content was perfectly optimized for its platform. The quality stayed high across
1:12:07
all eight formats. Gemini 2.5 Pro came second. Good adaptation skills, solid
1:12:13
content, but missing that creative spark. Grock 4 was adequate, functional, but boring. No compelling hooks, no
1:12:20
engagement. Claude was pulling ahead. Test four was editorial calendar development. Create a 90-day content
1:12:27
calendar for a project management tool. Target keywords around project management tips and team productivity.
1:12:32
Include content clusters, seasonal topics, lead magnets, promotion strategy. Here's the exact prompt I
1:12:38
used. Create a 90-day content calendar for our SAS project management tool targeting small business owners and team
1:12:45
leaders. We want to rank for project management tips, team productivity, and
1:12:51
small business efficiency. Include one, 24 blog post topics with target keywords
1:12:56
and search intent. Two, content cluster strategy linking related posts. Three,
1:13:02
seasonal trending topic integration. Four, lead magnet content three pieces.
1:13:07
Five, content promotion strategy for each post format as a detailed calendar with publication dates, word counts, and
1:13:14
success metrics. This is strategic planning at its finest. And here's where
1:13:19
things got interesting. Both Grock 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro tied for first place.
1:13:24
Both delivered excellent table-based organization, comprehensive planning, detailed timelines and metrics,
1:13:30
strategic thinking, visual clarity that made the plans immediately actionable. Claude the fourth sonic came third. good
1:13:36
analysis and recommendations, comprehensive, but it lacked the superior organization of the other two.
1:13:42
So, we had a three-way race going into the final test. Test five was technical SEO audit. I gave them a 500page
1:13:49
e-commerce website with multiple technical issues, duplicate title tags, slow site speed, broken links, missing
1:13:56
structured data, missing alt text, outdated XML sitemap, limited
1:14:02
development resources, only 20 hours per month. Here's the exact prompt. I'm the CMO of a 500page e-commerce website. Our
1:14:09
developer found these technical issues. One, 127 pages with duplicate title
1:14:15
tags. Two, site speed averaging 4.2 seconds on mobile. Three, 23 broken
1:14:20
internal links. Four, missing structured data on product pages. Five, 15% of
1:14:26
images missing alt text. Six, XML sitemap hasn't been updated in 8 months.
1:14:31
We have limited development resources 20 hours per month. Create a priority matrix ranking these issues by SEO
1:14:38
impact versus implementation effort and provide a three-month implementation road map. They had to create a priority
1:14:44
matrix rank issues by SEO impact versus implementation effort. Provide a
1:14:50
three-month road map. Both Grock 4 and Claude for Sonnet tied for first. Excellent strategic road maps, strong
1:14:57
prioritization logic, clear implementation paths, deep technical SEO understanding, practical resource
1:15:03
allocation. Gemini 2.5 Pro came third. Adequate technical understanding, but
1:15:08
missing the strategic depth and implementation detail. But wait, I wasn't done testing yet. I wanted to see
1:15:13
how these AIs handled something completely different, game development, because if you can build games, you can
1:15:19
build anything. So, I threw two more brutal tests at them. Test six was building a Minecraft inspired 3D world
1:15:24
generator using p5.gs. This is hardcore coding, real programming skills. Here's the exact
1:15:31
prompt. Build a Minecraft inspired 3D world generator using p5gs. Create one,
1:15:37
a 20x20 grid of procedurally generated terrain with different block types, grass, stone, dirt, water. Two,
1:15:44
firsterson camera controls. Where's the movement mouse look? Three, block placement removal system, left right
1:15:51
click. Four, at least four different block textures. Five, simple lighting or shading effects. Six, inventory system
1:15:58
showing available blocks. Seven, save, load, world state functionality. Focus
1:16:04
on performance. It should run smoothly at 30 plus frames pers. Include chunkbased loading for scalability.
1:16:11
This is insanely complex. 3D graphics, game mechanics, performance optimization, user interface, data
1:16:18
persistence. Claude for Sonet won this round. It actually created a game not fully playable, but it built something
1:16:24
that resembled what I asked for. The code structure was solid. The approach was logical. Grock 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro,
1:16:32
they finished fast, but the code was full of errors, broken functionality, incomplete features, speed without
1:16:38
substance. Then I hit them with test seven, a 2D endless runner game. Here's the prompt. Create a complete 2D endless
1:16:45
runner game using HTML 5 canvas and JavaScript. The game should include one, a character that can jump to avoid
1:16:51
obstacles. Two, randomly generated obstacles moving from right to left. Three, score system that increases over
1:16:58
time. Four, game over screen with restart functionality. Five, progressive difficulty. Obstacles get faster. Six,
1:17:06
simple particle effects when jumping or colliding. make it fully playable with smooth animations and responsive
1:17:12
controls. Include proper game state management and clean commented code.
1:17:17
Clawed Force on it absolutely destroyed this test. It created a completely playable game. Smooth animations,
1:17:23
responsive controls, progressive difficulty, particle effects, game state management, everything worked perfectly.
1:17:31
The game was actually hard but so fun to play like a real indie game you'd find on Steam. Grock 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
1:17:38
Same story. Fast responses, broken code, lots of errors, incomplete functionality. This revealed something
1:17:44
huge about these AIs. So, what were the final results after all seven tests?
1:17:50
Claude for Sonic won four solo victories and one co-win. Six out of seven strong performances. Absolutely dominant. Grock
1:17:57
4 won one solo victory and two co-wins. Three out of seven strong performances. Gemini 2.5 Pro won zero solo victories
1:18:04
and one co-ind. One out of seven strong performances. But here's what really matters. The insights. Claude for Sonnet
1:18:10
isn't just good at content creation. It's exceptional at complex coding tasks. Game development, interactive
1:18:16
applications, advanced programming challenges. When you need something that actually works, Claude delivers. Gro 4
1:18:23
and Gemini 2.5 Pro are fast. But fast doesn't matter if the code is broken, if
1:18:28
the functionality doesn't work, if you can't actually use what they create. This is the difference between an AI
1:18:35
that can help you build a real business versus an AI that just gives you pretty responses that don't work. Claude Forson
1:18:41
is the king of content creation, blog posts, copywriting, content repurposing. If you're doing content marketing, this
1:18:48
is your AI. The quality is consistently excellent. The engagement is superior. The readability is perfect. But that's not all. Claude also dominates complex
1:18:55
coding tasks, game development, interactive applications, advanced programming. When you need code that
1:19:00
actually works, Claude is your AI. Grock 4 is the analysis beast. Competitive research, strategic planning,
1:19:07
comprehensive reporting. If you need deep analysis, and strategic thinking, this is your AI. The organization is
1:19:13
excellent. The visual presentation is clean. Gemini 2.5 Pro is the speed demon. Fastest response times by far.
1:19:20
Good content quality for basic tasks. Reliable performance for simple requests. If you need quick turnaround,
1:19:26
and speed is more important than quality or functionality, this is your AI. But here's the thing that nobody talks
1:19:32
about. Different A is for different tasks. You don't need to pick just one. In my agency, we use Claude for all our
1:19:39
content creation, blog posts for clients, email campaigns, social media content. It's unmatched. We use Grock
1:19:47
for competitive analysis, market research, strategic planning. When we need comprehensive reports for clients,
1:19:53
we use Gemini when we need quick answers, fast research, rapid content for social media, time-sensitive
1:19:59
projects. It's like having different tools in a toolbox. You don't use a hammer for everything. But if I had to
1:20:04
pick just one AI for business, Claude Force on it, here's why. Content is everything in business today. Content
1:20:10
marketing drives leads, copywriting drives sales, email campaigns drive revenue, social media content builds
1:20:17
brands, and Claude dominates content creation. But here's what shocked me the most. Claude also dominates coding, real
1:20:23
development work, functional applications, interactive tools. This means Claude can help you build the
1:20:28
entire business ecosystem. Content to attract customers, code to serve customers, everything you need in one
1:20:36
AI. Plus, Claude's consistency is incredible. Every single test, it delivered highquality results. You can
1:20:42
trust it. Grock's word count issue in the blog post test is concerning. If it lies about something basic like word
1:20:49
count, what else might it get wrong? Speed is nice, but quality matters more. Would you rather have a fast AI that
1:20:56
gives you mediocre content or a slightly slower AI that gives you incredible content? I know which one I choose, but
1:21:03
only if you use it correctly. Only if you go beyond the surface level stuff, only if you treat it like the powerful
1:21:09
business tool it actually is. These test results prove that AI can handle complex business tasks, real work, real value.
1:21:16
The question is, are you ready to take advantage of it? Are you ready to use AI to scale your business, get more
1:21:22
customers, save hundreds of hours, or are you going to keep using it to write poems? The choice is yours. But I know
1:21:28
what successful entrepreneurs choose. They choose results over entertainment, business value over party tricks, real
1:21:34
applications over fun experiments. That's what separates successful people from everyone else. They see the
1:21:41
opportunity, they take action, they get results. If you want to join them, if you want to scale your business with AI,
1:21:47

1:22:50
below and let me know which AI you're going to start using for your business. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in
1:22:56
the next video. Google just dropped Gemini 2.5
1:23:03
flashlight and it's their fastest, cheapest AI model ever. But here's the crazy part. I spent hours testing this
1:23:09
thing and the results shocked me. We're talking about an AI that costs almost nothing but beats expensive models at
1:23:14
coding games. I built multiple games in seconds. I compared it head-to-head with premium models and what I found will
1:23:21
blow your mind. This could change everything about how we use AI. Hey, if
1:23:26
we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's
1:23:33
helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. And today, we're
1:23:39
talking about something massive. Google just announced Gemini 2.5 Flashlight. And when I say just announced, I mean
1:23:45
like hours ago. Now, Google's calling this their fastest and cheapest 2.5
1:23:50
model yet. But here's what got my attention. They're claiming it beats their old models on everything. Coding,
1:23:57
math, science, reasoning, everything. So, I did what I always do. I ignored the marketing hype and I tested it
1:24:04
myself for hours. Real world tests, no BS benchmarks that don't mean anything.
1:24:09
I built games. I created landing pages. I compared it directly with Gemini 2.5 Pro, which costs way more money. And
1:24:16
what I found was shocking. Because here's the thing, this model costs almost nothing to use. We're talking
1:24:22
fractions of a cent per request. But in some tests, it actually beat the expensive models. That's not supposed to
1:24:28
happen. So, in this video, I'm going to show you exactly what Gemini 2.5 flashlight can do. The real results, not
1:24:35
the marketing fluff. I'll show you where it crushes the competition and where it falls flat on its face. Plus, I'll show
1:24:41
you exactly how to use it for free right now. No credit card needed because if this model is as good as Google claims,
1:24:47
it could save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars on AI costs while actually giving you better results. But
1:24:53
first, let me explain what this thing actually is and why it matters. So, here's what Google just dropped on us.
1:24:58
Gemini 2.5 flashlight is their new preview model. And when they say preview, they mean you can use it right
1:25:04
now for free. No credit card, no payment required. Just go to AI Studio and start using it. Now, Google's calling this
1:25:11
their most costefficient and fastest 2.5 model yet. But here's what makes it different from everything else they've
1:25:17
released. It comes in two modes: thinking mode and non-thinking mode. In thinking mode, the AI actually thinks
1:25:24
through problems before answering. Like you can literally see it working through the problem step by step. This gives you
1:25:30
better results, but takes a bit longer and costs more if you're using the API. In non-thinking mode, it just gives you
1:25:36
answers fast. Super fast. Like crazy fast. And here's the kicker. Even in
1:25:42
non-thinking mode, it still beats the old 2.0 flashlight on everything. Coding, math, science, reasoning,
1:25:48
everything. But the real question is, how does it perform in the real world? Because benchmarks are nice and all, but
1:25:55
I care about one thing. Can this thing actually help me build stuff that works? So, I put it through my brutal real
1:26:02
world test. The same tests I use for every AI model. I started with something simple. I asked
1:26:08
it to build a Space Invaders game. Complete HTML, CSS, JavaScript, one
1:26:14
prompt, make it look amazing, and trigger loads of dopamine. Now, here's where it gets interesting. I ran the
1:26:20
exact same prompt on Gemini 2.5 Pro at the same time. Remember, 2.5 Pro costs
1:26:26
way more money. Is supposed to be the smart, powerful model. Flashlight finished first. Way first. But that's
1:26:33
not the crazy part. The crazy part is Flashlight actually worked perfectly on the first try. The game looked good. It
1:26:39
played smooth. Everything worked. Gemini 2.5 Pro, it failed. Completely failed
1:26:45
the oneshot test. didn't even create a working game. I'm staring at my screen thinking, "Wait, what? The cheap, fast
1:26:51
model just beat the expensive smart model. But maybe that was just luck." So, I tested it again. This time, I
1:26:57
asked both models to build a dopamine drums app, something visual with sound effects. Again, one prompt. Flashlight
1:27:04
coded it out super fast, added all the visual effects. But here's the thing, it forgot the audio. So, I just told it add
1:27:10
audio and boom, fixed instantly. Gemini 2.5 Pro. Still coding, taking forever.
1:27:16
And when it finally finished, the output was worse. Way worse. Now I'm starting to think something's going on here. So I
1:27:22
pushed it harder. I asked it to build a Sonic game as a single HTML file. This is where most AI models start to break
1:27:28
down. Flashlight delivered a playable Sonic game. Not perfect, but playable. The graphics were basic, but it worked.
1:27:34
Then I asked it to build a Flappy Bird game. Again, one shot. And you know what? It nailed it. The game worked perfectly. The physics felt right. The
1:27:41
difficulty was spoton. I'm playing this Flappy Bird game built by a model that costs almost nothing. And I'm thinking,
1:27:47
"This changes everything." But wait, there's more. Remember how I said this thing is fast? Let me show you exactly
1:27:54
how fast. I used it to build a complete SEO calculator landing page, beautiful design, working JavaScript, responsive
1:28:01
layout, the whole thing. It took seconds, not minutes, seconds. I've used Claude Sonic 4, GPT4, all the expensive
1:28:09
models. None of them code this fast. And the quality, it wasn't perfect, but it was definitely usable. For a model that
1:28:15
costs almost nothing, the output quality shocked me. But here's where it gets really interesting. I decided to test it
1:28:21
outside of AI Studio. I hooked Flashlight up to Cursor IDE. This is where AI models usually struggle because
1:28:28
they're working in a real coding environment, not just spitting out code snippets. I asked it to build a complete
1:28:34
landing page for NCO agency. Multiple sections, testimonials, FAQs, the works.
1:28:40
It coded the entire thing in under a minute. A complete functional landing page. Now, the design was pretty
1:28:46
average. Nothing special, but it worked and it was fast. Compare that to other models that either take forever or give
1:28:52
you broken code, and you start to see why this matters. But let's be real here. This model isn't perfect. When I
1:29:00
tested it for complex design work, it fell short. The landing pages looked okay, but not amazing. The color choices
1:29:06
were safe, but boring. For simple games, it did great. But when I asked it to
1:29:11
build more complex interactions, it struggled. And here's something weird I noticed. The outputs were better when I
1:29:17
used AI Studio directly compared to using it through other tools like Cursor or Open Router. Same model, same
1:29:23
prompts, but the quality dropped when I used it through third party tools. Let me show you some numbers that will blow
1:29:29
your mind. I tracked my usage for a full day of heavy testing, building games, creating landing pages, generating
1:29:35
content, debugging code, everything. Total cost with flashlight less than 2,
1:29:42
not $2,2. Compare that to Claude Son A4 where the same amount of work would cost around
1:29:48
$30 or GPT4 where you're looking at about $25. We're talking about a 99%
1:29:54
cost reduction while getting similar or sometimes better results. But here's what makes this even crazier. When I
1:30:01
used thinking mode, which gives you the best quality outputs, my cost went up to about 8 cents for the entire day. 8
1:30:07
cents. For premium AI reasoning that rivals models costing 300 times more.
1:30:12
Let me tell you about a few more tests that really opened my eyes. I asked Flashlight to create a crocodile pinball
1:30:17
game based on a diagram. Sounds weird, right? But I wanted to test its ability to take visual inspiration and turn it
1:30:24
into interactive code. First attempt was pretty basic, just static elements. But when I told it to make the UI more fun
1:30:31
and add JavaScript to animate the ball, flippers, and score, it delivered. Not perfect, but functional and fast. Then I
1:30:39
tested content creation. I asked it to write email sequences, blog posts, some social media content. The quality was
1:30:46
surprisingly good. Not as polished as Claude, but definitely usable for most businesses. And here's something
1:30:51
interesting. When I tested it for data analysis tasks, passing CSV files,
1:30:56
creating charts, analyzing trends, it handled everything I threw at it. This
1:31:02
isn't just a coding model. It's a legitimate allpurpose AI assistant that happens to cost almost nothing. Let's
1:31:07
talk about what's actually under the hood here. Flashlight comes with a full 1 million token context window. That
1:31:13
means you can feed it massive amounts of data and it remembers everything. It supports multimodal input, text, images,
1:31:18
video, audio. Though right now, it only outputs text. It connects to Google search and can execute code in real
1:31:24
time. So, it's not just generating code, it's actually running and testing it. And here's the kicker. It can scale compute resources dynamically based on
1:31:31
your budget. Need faster results? Increase the thinking budget? Want to save money? Turn thinking off. This
1:31:37
level of control is something you usually only see in enterprise level AI systems. So, how does Flashlight
1:31:43
actually compare to the big players? Against Gemini 2.5 Pro, it wins on speed every time. And for simple coding tasks,
1:31:50
it often gives better results on the first try. Against Claude Son A4 is faster, but Claude gives more polished
1:31:56
outputs. Against GPT4, it's way cheaper and faster, but GPT4 handles complex
1:32:01
reasoning better. But here's the thing that matters most. For 90% of the stuff you probably want to build, flashlight
1:32:07
is good enough, and it costs almost nothing. Let me get practical for a minute. Here's how real businesses are
1:32:14
already using this. Content creation agencies are using it to draft blog posts, social media content, and email
1:32:21
sequences. The quality is good enough that you just need light editing. Web development shops are using it to
1:32:26
rapidly prototype websites and applications. You can build and test ideas in minutes instead of hours. SEO
1:32:32
agencies like mine are using it to analyze competitor content, generate title ideas, and create content outlines
1:32:39
at scale. And here's something cool. Because it's so cheap, you can afford to run multiple versions of the same prompt
1:32:45
to get different perspectives, then pick the best one. Try doing that with Claude or GPT4 and you'll go bankrupt. Want to
1:32:53
try this yourself? Here's exactly how to get started. Go to studio.google.com.
1:32:58
Sign in with your Google account. Click on the model dropown and select Gemini 2.5 Flashlight Preview. Make sure you
1:33:05
turn on thinking mode if you want better results. though honestly even non-thinking mode is pretty good for
1:33:11
most stuff. Then just start building. Ask it to create whatever you want. Games, websites, tools, whatever. The
1:33:17
best part, it's completely free. No credit limits I've hit. No payment required. You can also use it through
1:33:22
open router if you want to connect it to other tools. But that will cost you money though. Honestly, the costs are so
1:33:27
low it barely matters. Here's what I think after spending hours testing this thing. Gemini 2.5 flashlight is not
1:33:34
going to replace the top tier models for complex work. If you need the absolute best reasoning or the most polished
1:33:39
outputs, stick with Claude Sonet 4 or GPT4. But for everyday AI tasks,
1:33:45
building simple apps, creating content, basic coding, this thing is a gamecher. It's fast enough that you don't lose
1:33:52
momentum while working. It's cheap enough that you don't worry about costs. And it's good enough that you actually get usable results. Plus, it's free
1:33:58
right now, so there's literally no reason not to try it. Will it stay free forever? Probably not. Google usually
1:34:04
starts with free previews, then adds pricing later, but right now, while it's free, this might be the best deal in AI.
1:34:10
Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below and let me know what you think about Flashlight.
1:34:16
So, we have the new update that's just come out from Gemini CLI. So, if you're
1:34:22
not familiar with what this is, very similar to Plug Code and that sort of thing, you basically code from your
1:34:28
terminal using Gemini CLI. It's an open- source project and basically gives you like an AI coding agent directly on your
1:34:35
laptop. We're going to be testing out today, seeing how it performs, seeing how it goes, etc. And it's going to be
1:34:41
very interesting to test this out and just give it a cheeky. So, what we're going to do is we're going to have a look first of all what this is, how it
1:34:48
works, etc. How to set it up and then we can just run a few tests on it, a few basic tests. So you can basically get a
1:34:55
AI studio account which is free. And then you can see here you get 1,000
1:35:01
model requests per day. 60 requests per minute is open source and is free of
1:35:06
charge before anyone says it's not free inside the comments. It is free. And you can see right here and basically it runs
1:35:13
in the command line. So you can basically open up with terminal I believe and then you can even like do Google searches and that sort of thing
1:35:20
which is pretty cool. So you can see a little demo of how it works here. What's
1:35:25
interesting is I think you can actually connect it to image and also Veo3
1:35:30
from the demo which is really cool. And I know core code has been trending like
1:35:37
crazy recently. So it's going to be interesting to see how this performs versus this as well. And you can also use it with Gemini code assist as well
1:35:44
inside Visual Studio Code. Here's an example of what it looks like. So to get started,
1:35:51
you can just install Gemini CLI. All you need is an email address to get Gemini.
1:35:57
And then the way that you can use it is through GitHub. All right. By the way, if you want like all this stuff, I'll
1:36:02
put the links as we go along inside the AI success lab. So let's do that. Get
1:36:09
this bad boy set up. So link in the comments description to the AI success lab and we can start getting this set
1:36:17
up. So let's see. tips for getting started, blah blah blah. And Joe says, "Is this a real Julian?" It is indeed in
1:36:24
the flesh, unlike my recent videos on YouTube. So, it's a rare appearance from
1:36:30
me. My AI avatar seems to be outperforming me on YouTube, which is scary and crazy at the same time. And
1:36:38
too dirty says, "Did they release an AI agent that's open source for free?" Yeah. So you can see on GitHub this is
1:36:44
Gemini CLI very similar to code as well to claw code and you can also use MCP
1:36:52
servers as well which is interesting. I haven't tested that out yet either but it's going to be yeah there's a lot of
1:36:57
cool stuff right here. So let's have a look. So we need Node.js version 18 or
1:37:02
higher. I'll put that inside the links as well. And then what else do we need?
1:37:09
I think we're good to go on that. I think I've got nojs already. So now we just need to copy this command. So I'm
1:37:15
on a Mac. I'm just going to open up the terminal here and then we should be able to paste this in. Let's see what
1:37:21
happens. It says, "I installed Gemini CLI thinking it was some sort of AI agent." It is an AI agent. It's just
1:37:28
more It's more like a coding agent. That's basically what it is. But it is an agent. Yeah, for sure. So we can
1:37:34
select the theme here. We got Dracula default, etc. So it's it's incredibly easy to set up, isn't it? Absolutely
1:37:41
ridiculous. And then you can put in your API key for Gemini or you can use Vertex or you can just loging in with Google.
1:37:47
Let's log in with Google. Let's log in right here. And that should be set up now. So it says Gemini code assist and
1:37:54
the Gemini CLI now authorized to access your account. The ease of just setting
1:37:59
this up is beautiful, isn't it? It's absolutely beautiful. So let's just check. Are you working, mate? And it
1:38:05
says yes. How can I help? Uh, so it's working perfectly right there, which is great. Incredibly easy to install. Or
1:38:11
you can use npm install as well. Pick a color theme authenticated. Boom. Honey
1:38:17
says it can do anything. Has access to your file system. So you can do more
1:38:22
than write code. They can build up a knowledge space, etc. Yeah, I think that's it, isn't it? You can do a lot
1:38:29
more. I mean, you can see a couple of examples right here, right? So you can say command new project. Gemini, write a
1:38:36
new Discord bot that answers questions using the FAQ MD file that I will provide. What else we got here? Give me
1:38:43
a summary of all the changes that went in yesterday. And that's for the existing project, right? So, what you
1:38:49
can see here is this. It's essentially taking the GitHub project. Then you command Gemini CLI Gemini and then get a
1:38:56
summary. What else we got here? Describe the main PC systems architecture. What security mechanisms are in place? Help
1:39:04
me migrate this codebase. This is interesting as well. So, make me a slide deck showing the git history
1:39:10
from the last seven days group by feature and team member or make a full screen web app for a war display to show
1:39:17
our most interactive issues. This interesting, isn't it? Let's see if we can work on a existing
1:39:23
project here. 230 says, "Can I use it to fix broken video files?" Interesting.
1:39:30
I don't know. all this. This only just came out a few hours ago. So, it'd be interesting to test out yourself and
1:39:35
just see, okay, what can it do or how can it work, etc. So, let's see if we can actually make a slide deck here. I
1:39:43
don't know if that's going to work. I'm just going to allow. In the meantime, whilst that's doing
1:39:49
that in the background, let's have a look what people are using it for on Twitter. See what people are saying.
1:39:56
It's always a fun game. So, write code, debug, and automate tasks. What else we
1:40:01
got here? See what people are doing. Lots of Japanese stuff. Coding. Oh,
1:40:06
someone did a coding royale battle. Look at that. Claw code, a non code, codeex,
1:40:12
open code, amode, and Gemini. And then just had six different terminals running
1:40:18
with the coders, which is pretty crazy. Look at that. So, someone's testing like Gemini versus Codeex versus Code as
1:40:26
well. There's me or the avatar version of me. There's me again. All right,
1:40:32
let's I can't see anything that people built with this. Generate a slide deck.
1:40:38
Okay, let's see what we can do. Generate a slide deck based on the GitHub. And
1:40:44
actually, what we'll do is we'll paste in that command. That's a test run inside GitHub.
1:40:50
Just grab that. Here we go. Can I use it to create a Telegram bot that accepts
1:40:56
payments? That's an interesting one as well. And then Honey says that battle royale one with the six coders, the
1:41:02
instruction was to terminate the other AI assistance. Crazy. It's got the git history from the command that we ran
1:41:08
earlier, right? So you can see basically what we've said is use this GitHub. Then
1:41:13
from there navigate to that blah blah blah. And then from there like start creating a slide deck. All right.
1:41:20
So we should be able to we should be able to create a slide deck from the GitHub.
1:41:26
I've created the slide deck in slide deck MD. I wonder if can you open up? So it's
1:41:33
going to convert it into I think. So basically what we've done is we've taken that slide deck that we created,
1:41:40
coded it out using this free AI coder and then converted it into HTML. And
1:41:47
let's see if this works. So would you like me to open the file for you? I'm going to put yes. And then it's going to
1:41:52
run that command. Boom. There we go. And that is a slide deck. I wouldn't say the
1:41:57
UI is the best in the world if I'm honest with you. But did we just create
1:42:03
a slide deck from the GitHub, open the project, code out for free, etc.? Yeah,
1:42:08
that was really easy. I say, can you make the UI
1:42:14
of this project more beautiful? W says everything you imagine is
1:42:21
possible. Yeah, that's true. Actually, you got to bear in mind like I don't even code. Like I have no idea what I'm
1:42:27
doing. But I can code now with this AI agent. So if I can do it, anyone can do it pretty much. Let's see. So let's see
1:42:34
if we can pre improve the UI of that presentation cuz that was pretty poor.
1:42:39
All right. So it's looking slightly nicer. But now I'm going to say, okay, can you add some rainbow colors and the
1:42:50
dopamine in GC design to the HTML file? For some reason, the first time I asked it to do
1:42:56
this, it just redesigned the theme for itself. So, let's see what we get back now. And you can see it's using Gemini
1:43:04
2.5 Pro. This is the API that's using to generate this. I think we get like
1:43:10
maximum 60 commands per hour, which is like one per minute, which is probably
1:43:15
about right if you're creating something. I don't think you're going to use more commands than that. I like the fact that you can take files locally.
1:43:22
So, you can like navigate to a folder and then convert all the files in that directory to PNG, for example, or
1:43:29
organize my PDF invoices by month of expenditure. So, you can actually interact directly with your system, if
1:43:35
that makes sense, like with your local laptop. So, it has struggled and now it switched
1:43:41
from 2.5 Pro to Gemini 2.5 Flash. I'm guessing everyone's just rinsing it
1:43:46
right now. The only thing I wonder about this is I feel if you're just coding out something like a HTML file, wouldn't you
1:43:54
just use AI Studio? Like, why are you going to use this? Do you know what I mean? Especially if it's so slow. If I
1:44:00
was coding the same thing inside AI Studio, it's probably going to get done within 30 seconds, something like that.
1:44:07
Look at this. It's broken. If you press escape, you can stop it, I
1:44:13
think. So, let's Okay, switch back to Gemini 5 Pro. It's still trying to
1:44:21
generate stylesheets. It did not take long to break. It
1:44:29
think Let's have a look. All right, we're going to go back try and go back to
1:44:34
main. What I'm actually going to do is we'll request. If you press control and
1:44:41
C, you can cancel the request, right? So, you can see here request canceled. So,
1:44:47
code out a SEO calculator. Let's see if it can do that. Why is it gone back to
1:44:53
integrating stylesheets? Madness. I might have to close it down and then
1:44:59
start again, I think, at this point. All right, let's quit that. Let's try again,
1:45:04
my friends. So, it's good for you to see this because, okay, it's not perfect. It does have some bugs. Nobody shows you
1:45:11
this stuff on YouTube, but I'll show you. So, let's try again. All right, so
1:45:17
we should be good to go now. Let's see. See if we can just do basic tasks again.
1:45:25
Ah, it's totally crashed. It must be everyone is rinsing it. I think that's the problem. So, it switched back to
1:45:31
flash. Now, the problem is if you don't know this already, if you're using Flash, like it's just not as good as
1:45:38
Gemini 2.5 Pro, if that makes sense. But I'm going to say, okay, go ahead, but
1:45:43
make sure the UI is as dopamine inducing
1:45:48
as possible. So, now it's working. So, basically, if you have any errors, just shut it down, run the git clone command
1:45:55
again, and then you can start coding again. It seems to work okay. I think the main thing is like the API for
1:46:02
Gemini 2.5 Pro is being rinsed and so it may switch over to flash instead, which
1:46:07
means worse outputs but faster responses. And there we go. Let's see if this Oh,
1:46:14
there we go. So, we got the ROI calculator ready to go. Let's calculate the ROI. That's looking good. Coded out
1:46:21
perfectly. Launched it in the command. It wasn't that fast, but it did the job.
1:46:26
And that is also saved locally. Plus, it's running on a local host. So, pretty cool. Not bad at all. So, you now know
1:46:35
how to set up Gemini CLI, how it works, what to do if you have any problems, how
1:46:42
to make sure that it doesn't just code, but also runs that in your browser, too, and how to do all of this for free. Now,
1:46:48
if you want the video notes from today, including like how to set up, etc., feel
1:46:53
free to get that inside the AI success lab link in the comments description. and you can grab the notes and the links
1:46:59
right there. Additionally, inside here, we have loads of different stuff. You can see like we even have a 5h hour AI
1:47:05
agents course in there. It's pretty insane. And loads of other stuff right here. Additionally,

1:47:25
plus all of this other stuff right here. So, feel free to get that link in the comments in the description. If you
1:47:31
create any apps or anything like that inside the terminal with the code
1:47:38
assist, then all you do is you navigate to the directory. You've got all the files inside that
1:47:44
directory folder, and you would just upload it to Netlerifi, something like that, and just get it hosted. That's the
1:47:50
easiest way to do it. Now, if you want to connect with me personally, feel free to connect with me inside the AI Profit
1:47:56

1:49:09
with you, and then basically automate and implement that process for you. Right? So if you're like, okay, I just
1:49:14
want you to implement a NAT process for me or set up some NA10 AI agents, etc.,
1:49:21
we can do that for you using the processes inside here. Link in the comments description. Appreciate you
1:49:27
watching and I'll see you on the next one. Cheers. B, I just discovered how to automate your entire browser using
1:49:32
Gemini 2.5 Pro completely free. And what I'm about to show you will transform how you think about AI productivity forever.
1:49:39
And yes, this AI is actually typing right now on Twitter and posting even whilst I'm talking to you. And you're
1:49:46
going to discover the secret Chrome extension that lets AI agents control your browser and talk to other AI agents
1:49:51
whilst you sit back just like I am and let the magic happen. Plus, I'll show
1:49:56
you how I got Gemini to automatically build entire applications, send emails, and post social media content without
1:50:01
touching my keyboard once. and the shocking moment AI took complete control of my browser started conversations with
1:50:07
chat GBT and Claude on its own. So we're going to talk about how to automate your browser with Gemini 2.5 Pro. So if you
1:50:16
want to automate your browser with Gemini 2.5 Pro, you can use this free Chrome extension called Nano Browser and
1:50:23
then you can install this to Google Chrome. You can see some examples of how it works right here. And essentially,
1:50:28
you can use your existing instance of Google Chrome and then start navigating across your browser. Now, this is 100%
1:50:35
free. You can also run locally, so it's more privacy focused. Additionally, you
1:50:40
can use the flexible LLM options. So, you can switch between different LMS essentially and also it's fully open
1:50:46
source. So, you can see here on it's available on GitHub as you can see. So,
1:50:51
it's open source. But if you want to use it directly, you can just go to your Chrome extensions and then from here
1:50:57
you're going to select nano browser. Make sure you've already installed it from the Chrome extension and then you can start using it. If you want to get
1:51:03
all the links from today, feel free to get that inside the AI success lab and we'll get straight into this. So I've
1:51:09
got a bunch of tests that I want to try out here. And to set this up, essentially what you're going to do is
1:51:14
you're going to go to your settings inside Nano Browser and this is how you can get your browser agent to start using it for you. So, for example, here
1:51:21
you can see I've typed in my AI my API key. If you want to get an API key, you can get a free one from AI Studio. You
1:51:27
don't need to pay. And then from here, just click on get API key. And then you can just create an API key for free
1:51:33
directly inside AI studio. Doesn't cost you a penny. And then you can start
1:51:40
using your magic, right? So, for example, if you go to the options, you
1:51:45
can select the models. And inside here, we can select whichever model we want, right? Okay. So if we've put in our API
1:51:51
key as Gemini like you can see then we can put in the details. We can add multiple different providers as well. So
1:51:56
you can use open Deep Seek, Atropic, OpenAI, Grock, O Lama even. So you can use like a locally hosted API. But
1:52:03
essentially from here you can then change the temperature. Temperature will change the
1:52:10
creativity and you can switch between who's a planner, who's a navigator and who's the validator to check if tasks
1:52:16
are completed successfully. So, if you go inside the what can I help section here and we'll say okay, let's just test
1:52:22
this out. See if it actually works. So, I'm going to go over here. I'm just going to make sure I'm signed into Bolt
1:52:28
and we see if it can actually build an app for us directly inside the chat. So,
1:52:34
let's put inside here inside the request section. Go to bold new and build an SEO app. We'll hit send
1:52:41
and we'll see what happens next. So this is using Gemini 2.5 Pro and you
1:52:47
can see that the AI has now navigated to the other AI and it's beginning to use it. Right?
1:52:53
So now it said input text to specify building an SEO app and it's actually done it. Right? So it said build an SEO
1:53:00
app and then submit the input text by pressing enter. It is extremely fast
1:53:05
when it's doing this and you can see it's interacting. You know I'm not typing anything or anything like that. You can also stop the operator at any
1:53:13
time if you click stop in the right hand side. And now it is creating the
1:53:18
project. So it's now built out the blog. Again, this is the AI using my browser.
1:53:23
I'm not controlling it. I've just literally given it a task and it's gone off and completed it. Right? We've got
1:53:29
the full app built by the AI here. So we've got AI agents essentially talking to AI agents inside our browser, which
1:53:36
is pretty wild if you ask me. And then you can see this is actually deployed now as well. So it's on a local host and
1:53:44
it's actually getting the source code for SEO implementation. So it's like clicking through the code and that sort
1:53:49
of thing. I'm going to stop it there, but that is pretty wild that it can just generate a blog as you can see and start
1:53:55
using that. Lucky Leo says, "How can I use Claude for free? Your videos are cool. Thank you." So you just go to
1:54:01
Claude and then you can start using it. They have a free plan, right? And inside the free plan, you can start using this
1:54:08
directly here. You can also get access to this inside po.com. So if you want to use it for free as well, you can use it
1:54:14
inside po.com. That's another option. And you can get Claude Sonic 4 and other models directly inside PO as well. So
1:54:21
that's basically how you can use it. So the browser has been completely controlled
1:54:28
by Gemini 2.5 Pro. We've managed to automate our browser using this process. What we're going to do from here is you
1:54:36
can now test it on the next test. Right? So far it's passed test one out of one. Let's
1:54:41
now say okay ask cheap and ask it what's the secret to happiness. So
1:54:47
let's go back over here and we'll just use the chat. And then from here it's
1:54:52
now navigated to chat GPT. Again it's crazy fast. The other thing that I like as well about this is it doesn't require
1:54:58
like any use of the terminal or messing around with API keys and setting up av
1:55:04
file. It's just like literally, okay, you want to set this up. Boom. There you go. It's actually failed to run that
1:55:12
task. Let's see if it can use Claude instead. So, going to say open up Claude
1:55:17
or Yeah, let's say open up Claude. And it's actually using Claude. So, it's typed in what's the secret to happiness?
1:55:24
type that question in and now it's having a little philosophical conversation with Claude directly.
1:55:31
Right? So again, you can get your AI to talk to AI. Pretty simple and easy right there. Okay. So next up, what we can say
1:55:39
and I'm just going to switch X accounts to a test one instead. So let's switch
1:55:45
over to AICO Mastery, which is totally different Twitter account I own. We're
1:55:51
going to stop that. Stop the validator. And then we're going to go inside here,
1:55:56
take the prompt, and we'll say go on X and post a terrifying, menacing, but funny tweet about the future of AR. So,
1:56:03
let's hit send. Lucky Leo is asking, can you run Claude on terminal?
1:56:08
Yes, you can, but it's going to cost you money, right? You need to be on the I think it's just the basic plan that you
1:56:15
can use it for now. But yeah, if you want to use cord locally, then you have to pay for claw code. Let's see if this
1:56:21
works. There we go. I will soon write tweets so good you'll wonder if you ever had an
1:56:28
original thought. Resistance is futile. Also, it's learning to make toast. Be
1:56:33
very afraid or hungry. So, it's written the tweet. It's posting the tweet and it just did
1:56:41
that fully automatically for free using Gemini 2.5 Pro. Pretty crazy stuff right
1:56:46
there. So, we're going to go with another prompt. So, I want to test and
1:56:51
push it to the limits where you find out if it can break or not. But yeah, this
1:56:56
is crazy. So, I'm going to say now go to openarch.ai. Design a funny but scary picture about
1:57:02
AI agents taking over the world. Let's see if it can do that. And it says task failed. The extensions gallery cannot be
1:57:09
scripted. Interesting. Let's try and open it up again. So, it's now navigated
1:57:14
to open art. Let's see if it can create an image. And it's struggling to do that to be
1:57:21
fair. It is struggling to do that. Let's see if it can now work on this one
1:57:27
instead. So, it's good to show you this cuz then you know, okay, what are the limitations here? Is it magic or does it
1:57:33
get stuck sometimes? So, let's see if it can. So, it's typed in a futuristic
1:57:39
city, but then it deleted it and it can't figure that out from what I can
1:57:44
see. So, it is struggling on some tasks. that one. It couldn't create images.
1:57:50
Let's try one final one. So, I'm going to say, okay, go to sununo.com and create a funny song. So, it's navigated
1:57:58
there. Now, it's put a silly song about a cat who thinks he's a dog.
1:58:04
It's getting stuck on the capture. Yeah, it looks like it really got stuck on that. Seems to have failed. It did
1:58:11
create something on. Let's have a look what it actually did create.
1:58:16
So, we got that here. This is like a AI music creator. Yeah, I think that's an
1:58:21
old one to be fair. So, I think basically from what I can see, it can do
1:58:27
basic stuff like tweeting. It could probably do outreach for you. It could probably send emails for you and that
1:58:32
sort of thing, but it does seem to struggle with creating
1:58:38
images and also generating songs. It seems to like struggle with interacting with websites. doesn't really know very
1:58:44
well if that makes sense. Let's try one more here. We'll just go to a random test Gmail
1:58:52
account and I'm going to say go to here and write an email
1:58:59
to me julianoldie.com. Let's see if it can do that. Yeah. So,
1:59:04
now it's starting to work again. It's navigated to Gmail. It's clicked on the
1:59:10
compose button. It's filled in. So, it's typing in my email address here.
1:59:15
Seems to be working so far. I'm feeling optimistic. Now, it's filled in the email body. So,
1:59:21
it wrote, "Nano browser is very good." It's typed in the subject line as well.
1:59:28
And it sent the message, my friends. Look at that. Boom.
1:59:33
Sent the message. No problemmo. No big deal. It's just an AI sending emails
1:59:38
inside a browser for free using a Chrome extension. That's pretty crazy to be fair. It only failed on a couple of
1:59:44
tests. Everything else it seemed to do really well. If you want to see the notes on how to set it up, everything else, feel free to get that inside the

2:01:17
Appreciate you watching. See you on the next one. Cheers. Claude 4 versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. Who wins? I just spent hours
2:01:24
testing both models head-to-head and the results are absolutely I'm talking sidebyside coding battles, real world
2:01:30
performance tests and features that will blow your mind. One model completely
2:01:35
destroys the other in most categories. But there's a shocking twist you won't see coming. Here's what I'm revealing.
2:01:40
The AI super agent that put one model light years ahead controlling browsers and laptops for 7 hours straight. live
2:01:47
coding comparisons building games and tools so you can see which AI codes faster and creates better UIs and the
2:01:53
one feature where the losing model actually crushes the competition and changes everything and throw just
2:01:59
released the Kraken Claude 4 is out and today we're going to be testing Claude 4 versus Gemini Pro 2.5 to see which one
2:02:08
is the best. So for example we can compare 2.5 Pro preview which was previously my favorite model against
2:02:15
Claude 4. Now Claude have just released two new models. Opus 4 and Sonnet 4.
2:02:20
Sonnet 4 is pretty good for everyday tasks. Opus 4 is the best for coding.
2:02:27
And you can see the benchmarks here. So if we compare for example the benchmarks of Claude 4, Opus 4 and 4 versus Gemini
2:02:34
2.5 Pro. You can see the benchmarks here. So for agentic coding, Claude 4 is
2:02:39
absolutely smashing. Gemini 2.5 Pro 63% from Gemini 2.5 Pro versus Claude 4 at
2:02:47
79 and 80%. If we look at aentic terminal coding, Gemini 2.5 Pro is
2:02:53
really far behind, right? So for example, 25% versus 41% and 50% graduate
2:03:00
reasoning, they're all about similar actually. So, it's only a tiny little fraction between them. Agentic tool use.
2:03:08
Gemini 2.5 Pro actually can't use Agentic to Tools. And I'll show you what that means in a second. Multilingual
2:03:13
Q&A, no benchmarks right there. Visual reasoning. Actually, Gemini 2.5 Pro is
2:03:19
winning on the benchmarks. And then high school maths competition. You can see here that Gemini 2.5 Pro is falling
2:03:25
behind Sonic 4 and Opus 4. But let's see what they actually do in reality. So,
2:03:30
we've got Gemini Pro Preview selected over here. We've got Claude and depending on the task, I'll switch
2:03:36
between Opus 4 and Sonic 4 depending on what we got. And we'll just compare them side by side and see which one creates
2:03:42
the best outputs. So, the first prompt that we're going to go with, and all these prompts are inside the AI Profit
2:03:48
Boardroom link in the comments description if you want to steal them from me, but we're going to say, okay, make me a captivating endless runner game. Key instructions on the screen,
2:03:54
blah blah blah. We're going to plug this into Gemini. Use canvas. And then we'll also do the same inside
2:04:01
Claude 4 as well. But I'm going to switch to Opus 4 because that's the most powerful model for coding. We'll plug
2:04:07
these in and see what we get back. All right. So if we go side by side over here. So you can see them both coding
2:04:14
out at the same time. This is Gemini 2.5 Pro. This is Opus 4. And they're both
2:04:20
coding out here. They both have artifacts features as well which allows us to preview the code when we actually
2:04:26
run it inside the chat. You can also get free This is interesting as well. So with Claude 4, you can get free access
2:04:33
inside Claude AI. If you want to get free access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, as far as I'm aware, the best way to get free
2:04:39
access is you go to a studio.google.com and you can get free access directly
2:04:44
inside here. By the way, if you want all my best trainings on Claude 4, I'm actually giving them away for free
2:04:50
inside the AI success lab link in the comments description. Just go to the AI course and you'll see tons of resources
2:04:57
and eight different ways to use Claude 4, including how to set up MCPS and AI
2:05:02
super agents that can control your browser. So, feel free to get that link in the comments description. Completely free, my friends. All right, so if we
2:05:09
open this up, let's see what we got here. So, it's created the code, but I don't think that Gemlai can actually
2:05:15
preview P5.js inside the browser here. So, you can see there's no preview on the canvas. If we open up Claud, we can
2:05:22
actually preview this game directly inside the canvas. As you can see, let's have a little cheeky whirl at this. See
2:05:28
what we get back. Yeah, the game is working perfectly. That is beautiful. And we can play it directly inside the
2:05:35
browser, which is awesome. All right, so let's compare that now side by side versus Gemini. We're going to have to go
2:05:41
to p5 js preview to actually check this out. So, let me do that. We'll take that code and
2:05:48
then we'll go over to p5 js over here. In some ways, Claude is
2:05:55
already winning because it can actually preview the code directly inside the browser when it's using p5 js. But let's
2:06:00
plug this in. So, we got the code right here from the game.
2:06:06
We'll compare these side by side. Which one looks the nicest, do you think? That's pretty decent to be fair, but I
2:06:11
think let's have a look here. And this one also, the dinosaur is backwards. So honestly, like if I'm comparing them
2:06:18
side by side, I would say the UI is a bit nicer here and it's pretty easy to use.
2:06:24
So it's a bit more interesting in the background. If we compare that versus Gemini 2.5 Pro, it's a bit weird, right?
2:06:32
Look at all the real state at the top versus the actual game. So the game is down here, but why is there all this
2:06:38
real state at the top right here? It doesn't make sense to have that empty space. So if I had to pick one, I'm going to go with Claude simply because
2:06:44
it created a nice UI and also it coded out faster and additionally it allowed
2:06:50
us to preview directly inside the browser. Let's test another one now. So if we go back to the aircraft for
2:06:57
boardroom, we'll grab this one. Going to go into new chat for both and we'll say,
2:07:02
can you create a 3D car simulator? And then it's building these out. Now you can see here that Gemini 2.5 Pro is
2:07:09
stuck on thinking mode. So it's going through thinking mode first. Whereas this just gone straight into action
2:07:14
mode. You can toggle thinking inside the settings over here. So if you click on the settings, you can see that for
2:07:21
example, we've got extended thinking as an option if you want to enable that.
2:07:28
Alexa, stop. And Claude has actually come back to us quicker with the
2:07:33
preview. So, we've got the preview of Claude over here. So, let's test this out. That looks pretty awesome, to be
2:07:39
fair. The UI is pretty nice. Quite like that. Honestly, if I had to pick one, I
2:07:44
don't like the spinning camera on this. This is making me dizzy. So, this is Claude. This is Gemini 2.5 Pro. I would
2:07:51
go with Gemini 2.5 Pro for this, to be honest. It's just It's weird that this has got a
2:07:57
spinning camera. And also, I just think the UI looks a bit nicer inside Gemini. However, Claude did it faster, right?
2:08:04
So, Opus coded a lot faster. Now, one of the ways the Claude wins, I
2:08:12
would say, versus Gemini is that Claude can actually control your browser. So, for example, if I go over to Claude here
2:08:19
and I open up Claude desktop, right? And I'm just going to enable
2:08:25
inside the browser here the browser MCP agent extension. As you can see, all
2:08:31
this training is inside the AI success lab if you want to learn how to set this stuff up. But we're going to go inside
2:08:36
Claude here and using the browser MCP that only Claude can use right now. I'll
2:08:42
say, okay, research the latest AI news headlines using my
2:08:48
browser. And then we'll select Claude 4. We'll use Sonet 4. And so you can see
2:08:54
now it just navigated straight away to TechCrunch. So, it went to techcrunch.com using the browser. So, it
2:09:00
can control my browser in the background whilst I'm talking to you. And then you can see here it's clicking through the
2:09:06
website, navigating the page. You've basically got an AI super agent on your desktop that's configured directly
2:09:12
inside the native Claude, right? And this is getting better and better. I
2:09:17
will warn you. So, for example, with Claude Opus 4 now and the new update, they've actually announced that this can
2:09:22
work for 7 hours on a task uninterrupted. Now, how many people in the world can
2:09:28
work on a task uninterrupted for seven hours? Very few, right? Maybe like the top 1%, something like that. And so,
2:09:35
what I'm saying here is this is a serious threat to taking over particularly a lot of admin tasks. But
2:09:41
in general, I think browser use is going to wipe out a lot of jobs because if these AI agents can do tasks better and
2:09:47
more focused than most humans, then what does that leave for the basic admin
2:09:52
worker, right? So, this is now navigating through the website. is scrolled through the internet etc.
2:09:57
Obviously, you can't do that inside Gemini, right? And Gemini can't control
2:10:02
your laptop. Also, this inside here as well, if we go to a new chat and we say,
2:10:08
okay, what's my battery percentage? We enter and not only can Claude control
2:10:15
your browser, but it can also control your laptop, right? So, you can see here, for example, using the Apple script MCP trailing inside the AI AI
2:10:24
success lab. if you want to get access to this stuff. But inside claude, this native desktop claude, you can see here
2:10:30
that we're using the Apple script execute and then it's like right, your battery is at 97% and it's currently charging. It shows about 23 minutes
2:10:37
remaining until it's fully charged. So, in many ways, Claude does win that battle simply because Gemini is not even
2:10:43
in the race right now. They do have Project Marina and I've tested out Project Marina which can control and
2:10:49
operate your browser in a virtual environment. I'll be 100% honest with you, it's super slow and not that great
2:10:54
from what I've tested so far. I'm sure it'll get better, but it's just it's nowhere near the same level as Claude
2:11:00
when it comes to this stuff. So, when it comes to coding out this game,
2:11:05
Gemini 2.5 Pro one, when it came to coding out the first game, which was the
2:11:12
3D runner game, Claude won. And then when it comes to AI super agents and controlling your browser, etc., clawed
2:11:18
one simply because Gemini 2.5 Pro is not even in the race. And you've seen all the benchmarks as well. So, I've shown
2:11:23
you all the benchmarks side by side versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. You can see an example of Claude playing Pokémon right
2:11:30
here. This is playing Pokémon just like a human would, and it's just going off and navigating the game and working its
2:11:36
magic, which is pretty wild if you ask me. Now, if we go back to our tests,
2:11:42
let's try something else out. Now we're going to try a test just for building out like a simple website
2:11:49
right so for example we say okay create a beautifully designed snow day calculator SEO optimize for the keyword
2:11:55
actual content location relevant tool we'll go inside Gemini hit new chat make
2:12:00
sure you got the canvas selected here then we're going to hit enter and then if we go inside claude we'll use opus 4
2:12:10
and do the same thing now there is one thing that Gemini can do
2:12:16
that Claude can't. And this blew me away when I test out yesterday. I got a full video on it yesterday if you want to
2:12:23
check this out. But let me show you exactly what I'm talking about. Inside Gemini here, if you're on the ultra
2:12:28
plan, you can actually build stuff with Veo3. And with Veo3,
2:12:34
you can actually create content that's synced directly with the audio, right?
2:12:40
So you can say for example say this oneliner and just go off and do this. Let me show you an example what I mean.
2:12:45
So inside the AI success lab if you want to check this stuff out. This was a clip of a comedian in a show
2:12:53
delivering this cheeky oneliner. Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything. I'm going to
2:12:58
mute this cuz I don't want it to mess up the sound on the video. But you can see here we generated this insane video with
2:13:04
AI using one prompt and the audio and the video match perfectly. It's wild. Plus, you can share it on a subdomain.
2:13:11
Claude can't and probably will never be able to do that. So, Gemini wins in many ways as
2:13:16
well. Multimedia stuff, then you know, Gemini has it all inside the
2:13:22
ultra package. Obviously, you have to pay a lot of money for that, but it is a powerful pack. So, we can see these
2:13:28
coding out here. And Gemini smash the task. It's got a nice little
2:13:34
background. It's pretty basic in terms of the content on the page, but I'm pretty sure this works. If we click
2:13:39
calculate snow day chance, yes, you can see it works. Estimate chance of snow day blah blah. But look at the UI from
2:13:46
Claude 4. So if we pull this up, which one is nicer? 100% is Claude. Claude 4.
2:13:53
The title, the UI, the background, the colors used, the way the font is designed, etc. The front end is much
2:14:01
nicer on Claude 4 versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. And so I would say Claude 4 is winning
2:14:06
on that front, too. So, if I had to pick one, I'm going to go with Claude 4. Honestly, I think
2:14:13
that's the best unless I needed to generate like videos and avatar videos and that sort of thing. I just don't think Gemini 2.5 Pro is at the same
2:14:21
level just yet. And also, Claude 4 is available for free, right? You get a limited number of usages per day and you
2:14:27
can build some amazing stuff out like I've shown you today. Plus, you can use it as an AI super agent to just go off,
2:14:34
use your laptop, use your browser, do whatever you want. Right? If you want the training for all the stuff that I've
2:14:39
shown you today, feel free to get that inside the AI success lab. Link in the comments description. It is completely
2:14:44
free and it comes with a community of 7,000 members where you can just share
2:14:50
what you're creating, learn from us, post in the community, etc. And it's completely free. Plus, it comes with all
2:14:56
my latest training, right? So, Claude 4 comes out, boom, shakalaka. I create three different trainings on exactly how
2:15:02
to use it, right, within hours. So, if you want to get the latest craziest stuff that's going on right now in the
2:15:08
AI world, feel free to get the AI success lab link in the comments description. It is completely free.
2:15:13
Again, if I had to pick one, I'm going with Claude 4 unless I need to create videos. And then Vea 3 is a goat right
2:15:20
now. It's a go. And also, this comes with tons of other stuff. So, for example, like NA10, appointment setter,
2:15:25
apps, AI super agents, short automations, etc. And we're constantly
2:15:32
giving away free trainings every single day inside the AI success lab. So, make sure you join before you miss out. And
2:15:37
if you want to get coaching help, support, if you want to get DM support, if you want to get weekly coaching calls
2:15:42
where you can learn how to implement this stuff, right? Because it's one thing knowing exactly how to use this
2:15:49
stuff. It's another thing knowing how do you implement it in your business, right? How do you use it to make money? How do you use it to to personalize and
2:15:56
automate the processes you have going on? That's what I recommend inside the AI profit boardroom because you can jump on there. It's community focus on making
2:16:02
money and saving time with AI. And you can see inside the community here, you can post questions and actually get
2:16:08
answers. You won't find that inside the AI success lab. You won't be able to get help inside the AI success lab because
2:16:14
everyone's just doing their own thing. The 7,000 people in there is too busy. Whereas the AI profit boardroom, it
2:16:20
comes with an awesome community of people just really serious about stuff, all working together, working towards a
2:16:27
goal, which is scaling the business, making money, and saving time with AI. comes with courses and workflows that
2:16:33
you will not find anywhere else, including how we've scaled our business using this crash course and different
2:16:38
automations you won't find anywhere. And additionally, inside the calendar here, you can jump on coaching calls. We're
2:16:44
going to jump this up to three coaching calls a week next month. And already you
2:16:50
can jump on the live calls, ask any questions you have. Plus, you can DM us if you need support, if you need help,
2:16:55
and if you're stuck on anything. So, this is the best place to get coaching and personalized support. Thanks so much for watching. Appreciate it. Link in the
2:17:01
comments description if you want to get this stuff and I'll see you on the next one. Cheers. Bye-bye. So, what we're going to be testing now is Bolt DIY with
2:17:08
Gemini 2.5 Pro. Now, if you want to set this up, pretty simple inside the GitHub
2:17:13
instructions like you can see right here. So, you can actually use BoltDIY and Gemini 2.5 Pro to build out your own
2:17:21
apps. And you can do it for free using a free API key and the latest version of Gemini 2.5 preview. So, let me show you
2:17:28
exactly how to do this step by step. The way that we're going to deploy this is we're going to use this inside terminal. So, I'm just going to open up terminal
2:17:35
now. Let's plug this in. Here we go.
2:17:40
And you just copy the commands. Now, if you get stuck with anything or you need to install any dependencies and you're
2:17:45
struggling, then just copy and paste the whole stuff from terminal, you can press Ctrl A and then Ctrl C. And once you've
2:17:53
done that, you can paste that into Claude and just ask for help set up. Like you can see, we literally just
2:17:59
copied and pasted all the instructions from GitHub. Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to open this up on a new
2:18:05
local tab like you can see. And then what we're going to do is inside here
2:18:10
we're going to select Google and we shall select let's have a look here. All
2:18:17
right. So you can see here you can switch between the two. Now, if you want to use Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, you select
2:18:24
this one. You can see $0 in, $0 out. It's not going to cost you any money. If you want to use 2.5 Pro preview, then
2:18:33
you're going to pay for tokens right there. But again, you can just switch to the free one if you want right here. Right. I'm going to use preview just
2:18:39
show you the full power of this today. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to go to a studio.google.com.
2:18:45
Get an API key. Create an API key. plug that in like you can see right here
2:18:54
and then we can copy that and plug it directly into Bolt. Right? So you see you've got this set up locally which is
2:19:00
great cuz then you can come back to the projects and it is completely free to use BoltDIY. Now some people watch this
2:19:06
and say it's not free. I've shown you you can set up BoltDIY for free and also
2:19:12
you're not paying for Bolt new this way cuz you're running this locally. All right? It's an open- source thing.
2:19:17
Right? So now what we can do is we can plug in our API key over here. We're going to hit enter and then from here we
2:19:22
can start running the code. So let's take one of these example
2:19:27
prompts like this. So for example, make a space invaders game just to test is actually working. Just going to grab an
2:19:34
API key from open router. Copy that. I'll delete these API keys after the
2:19:39
live stream. So we're going to grab an API key from open router to start using preview inside here. We'll go inside
2:19:45
open router here. Plug that in. paste it in. There we go. And you can see it's
2:19:50
building it out. Right. So, we're using Gemini 2.5 Pro preview, which is the latest model. All right. Now, if you go
2:19:57
over to open router here and we go to models, you can see Gemini 2.5 Pro preview is
2:20:05
the latest update from Google Gemini and it was created on May December, 2025.
2:20:11
Right? So, that's the main one that we're using here. And then if we go back, we can see it's coding it out
2:20:16
right now. Now, the main benefit of using Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview is that it tends to be better than building stuff,
2:20:23
for example. You can use Claude, for example, but Claude is just nowhere near as good from what I've seen. And the main reason for that is like Claude is a
2:20:29
lot slower when you're coding stuff out. Whereas Gemini, it seems to be a lot faster. It's pretty cheap or it's
2:20:36
completely free if you use the ways I've shown you today. And you can see it literally works like full first time.
2:20:41
It's absolutely crazy. So, let's start building some ideas out. Now, that was just like a simple
2:20:46
experiment and we're going to go inside here and just plug in your niche and
2:20:51
then get some ideas, right? So, if I say, okay, give me some fun ideas
2:20:58
for creating simple apps for my SEO agency.
2:21:03
We'll grab this. So, that's going to give us some ideas. So, for example, like the backlink builder tycoon game.
2:21:09
We'll go into bolt new. We'll plug that in. We'll say build this. And I'm just
2:21:15
going to say give me a simple demo I can test.
2:21:21
No need to build out the full game yet. Right. So, basically what we've done here is we've taken our industry, our
2:21:28
niche, got a bunch of ideas for building games and apps using that niche, and
2:21:33
then we've plugged that into Bolt DIY. We're using Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview plus
2:21:39
Bold DIY to build this out, right? Like you can see. So, if we hit enter like so, that should start doing its magic
2:21:45
now. And you can see it's just coding itself out. And there we go. Boom.
2:21:51
Game is done. Right now, what you could also do is you can say, okay, turn this idea into a 3JS runner game. Wait for
2:21:59
that response. And again, you can get everything that you've built on the left hand side here.
2:22:06
And then also if you want to preview this, you can actually open it up in a
2:22:11
separate tab like you can see. So you just click this popup button over here.
2:22:16
So there we go. I'm just going to say make sure the preview works and we'll
2:22:22
see what we get back. So now we've got the outputs of the game. Obviously
2:22:27
that's like the basics, right? The raw sort of files. So what I'm going to say now is add more detail to the game.
2:22:34
make it more interesting, add some core backgrounds, etc., right? Make it feel
2:22:43
more immersive. And then what you can also do is you can copy that and if you see this bit at the bottom, this is the
2:22:49
AI prompt generator. So if we click on enhance the prompt, what that can do is
2:22:54
just improve the prompt. So it's got more bit more detail. Now the other thing you can do as well is if that just doesn't work like you can see right here
2:23:00
then you can just go into chat GBT and just say okay improve this prompt
2:23:07
for bold DIY like you can see. All right now as you're doing that as well if we
2:23:15
click on enter. So we can just go back and forth and build out the app step by
2:23:21
step. So you can see the AI preview now. This is like the improved version of it. I'm also wondering if we can code two
2:23:28
things at the same time. Last time I checked, he couldn't with bolt DIY, but let's see if you can now. So, if we go back here to the main section, we'll
2:23:35
take the next idea in a second. Now, that actually if
2:23:41
you code two things out at the same time, seems to break it. So, you can see here, this is stop coding now with no
2:23:47
preview. So, just something to bear in mind there. So, you can't build two things at the same time. So now we'll
2:23:53
wait for the anchor text game to roll out. See what we can build here. This
2:23:59
actually seems to have stopped for a second here. So I'm just going to
2:24:05
stop the terminal, which is good for you to see if you're not sure how to fix this. So you can see here that it's actually broken on us.
2:24:12
I'm just going to switch that back on now. We'll just PM install that. Then
2:24:18
we'll go again. I just need to check my credits as well on
2:24:23
open router. Yeah, we're all good to go there. Now, this might be because of a limit on the Gemini 2.5 Pro updates. So,
2:24:32
if you are struggling between them, you can just switch through here. So, if one API stops working, you can actually
2:24:38
change the API inside the drop down here if you're struggling at any point. All
2:24:43
right. And there we go. We've got the anchor text match game ready to go. So we can drag and drop like it gives us
2:24:49
the idea or whether it's incorrect or correct. So if we take best SEO tool to tools and drag it to top SEO software
2:24:56
correct match boom we've got it right now. If you want to improve the UI etc. This is super basic. It's always going
2:25:01
to build out like a basic prototype and then you can create something more interesting like you can see right here. So we got
2:25:07
two out of five. So if we go back inside here and we'll say okay make the design
2:25:14
more modern, sleek, interesting, put your lingo style and then we'll hit
2:25:21
enter and just vibe code it to a better prototype. Again, if this just stops working like
2:25:28
you can see, we can switch to pro experimental. Then we'll say continue and you can just switch between them. So
2:25:36
there you go. You can see it's working now. does seem to have a rate limit. So, just bear with it, right? Especially if you're using the free APIs. Like, it
2:25:43
might take a little bit of time, but that's the price you pay, isn't it? You can either have it cheap or you can have
2:25:48
it fast. Started trying to create sound effects for some reason, but I told it not to. So, that's why it's bouncing
2:25:55
around now and just changing a few things. The other option that you have with Gemini is you don't just have to
2:26:01
use bolt DIY as well. So, another option is you can just go over to Firebase, right?
2:26:07
So, for example, if bold DIY is struggling, maybe you're trying to build something more complex or you need a bit
2:26:13
more guidance like a proper app sort of process, then you can go over to Firebase. And this is actually quite
2:26:18
impressive now with Gemini 2.5 Pro. Plus, it is free to use. So, I'm just
2:26:24
going to show you some examples and I'll delete these. So, if we go over to here and we
2:26:30
create this. So, we'll copy that idea from chat GPT. Click on create this.
2:26:36
This is like another bolt new alternative that's completely free
2:26:41
as long as you only do 10 workspaces at a time. And the cool thing about this is it will actually give you like a
2:26:47
briefing document to approve first. So for example, you got the SEO myth busters features down here, style
2:26:53
guidelines, etc. We'll click on protoype this app. And then all we need to do
2:26:59
is just go back. I'm just going to delete that API key. One sec. So, if we go to AI Studio,
2:27:06
grab the API key from there so we can get a free one. Copy that.
2:27:12
Go over here. This is going to ask us in a sec for an API key. So, we'll just wait for this to
2:27:18
code out. So, you can see it's built out the blueprint. Here's the name of the app, SEO Mythbusters. It's going to
2:27:23
include quiz questions, feedback, interactive UI, email capture, and results summary. Now, it's coding it
2:27:30
out. What you can also do as well is for example the email capture stuff. If you're not bothered about that then you
2:27:37
can say don't worry about the email capture. But you can see here now it's coded out the app. So we got SEO mythbusters. UI is pretty nice and
2:27:43
clean. Let's just test it out. And then if we actually plug in an API key over here. So let's copy that. Go back here.
2:27:50
Plug that in inside here. We can use the AI API key to generate responses inside
2:27:56
the app. Right? So for example, if we put keyword stuff in helps improve SEO rankings, that's false obviously. Then
2:28:03
it's generating the feedback and that should be using the API key from Gemini
2:28:09
that we just plugged in over here. All right. So it's another way to build apps to be honest like the outputs nowadays
2:28:15
as you can see like the outputs are probably nicer directly inside Firebase Studio versus using Bold DIY. But if you
2:28:22
prefer to code locally, then you're going to use Bold DIY. Right? This is another one. So it's called White Hat
2:28:28
Defender, a black hat SEO defense game. Let's prototype that out as well. And you can
2:28:35
build two apps side by side, right? So whilst you're waiting for one to code, you can build out the other one. And
2:28:40
then also inside here, you can switch to code. So you can actually get all the files from the document.
2:28:48
You can hit publish on that as well. So if we click publish right like so, we're good to go on that. But yeah, you can
2:28:56
see there's many different ways to build out apps, tools, games, etc. So, thanks

2:29:36
how to build anything and automate anything. So, today I'm going to show you all of the best ways to use Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview, which is a new update
2:29:44
from Google, just got announced a few hours ago to build and automate almost anything that you can imagine, right?
2:29:50
So, we're going to get straight into this. The first way that you can actually start using Gemini is if you go to gemini.google.com,
2:29:57
then you're going to select 2.5 Flash and that will use the latest model to build whatever you want. Right? So, for example, here if we go inside Gemini
2:30:04
now, and we're going to select canvas, and this will allow us to not just build with Flash, but also to build apps with
2:30:10
a live preview. So, let's go inside here. We'll use 2.5 Flash. We'll select canvas. And then we're going to say
2:30:16
something like, okay, create a drawing app for me. That's going to code it out.
2:30:22
And once it's ready, it will also give you a live preview. So you can actually check this out as a live preview and
2:30:27
code out really fast. So you can see here we've got the simple drawing app. And let's test it and make sure it
2:30:33
works. We can have a go. And you can see that the drawing app works perfectly.
2:30:39
You can change the color over here. And we're good to go on that. Not only this, but with Gemini 2.5 Flash, it is really
2:30:45
fast to build out. And additionally, you can actually host it on a subdomain. So, if we click on share in the top right,
2:30:50
then it's going to create a link for us. If we click on that link, we've now got the sharable app ready to deploy and
2:30:57
it's ready to go as you can see. So, let's just test this out. There we go. Drawing app built in literally one
2:31:04
click, one prompt, worked perfectly. Flash has got a lot better since its
2:31:09
update today. It seems to be faster. seems to be easy to use and if you just want to code out stuff I would recommend
2:31:15
just going directly to gemini.google.com simply because you can get the live preview and it's quite easy to deploy
2:31:21
stuff as a oneclick domain. Now if you want to for example
2:31:26
get the code for this you can go to try rule out canvas and then it will give
2:31:32
you the code directly inside the chat as well. Next up one of the other ways that you can start using this is inside AI
2:31:38
studio and again this is a free way to get access to it. So you can go to Gemini 2.5 flash preview in the top
2:31:43
right under the settings. So go to 2.5 then flash preview and then inside here you can start coding. Now inside here as
2:31:50
well you can also do like native image generation check out other apps. You can
2:31:55
easily get the access to the API as well from Gemini and then we can start coding. So for example if we take a
2:32:02
prompt that I've just built with we'll go to the history. We created this endless runner game using 2.5 flash
2:32:11
preview. And literally all we said was make me a captivating endless runner game. Key instructions on the screen, p5 js, no html. I like pixelated dinosaurs
2:32:18
and interesting backgrounds. Coded that out perfectly pretty quickly as well. And we were using the new thinking mode
2:32:24
from Gemini 2.5 flash as well. And then if we go over to p5 js editor.p5js.org
2:32:31
if you want to check this out. Paste this in. Hit play. Test this out. And
2:32:36
there we go. Game is working perfectly, right? And again, you can just build this out for free in one prompt, one
2:32:42
shot. Works really well. Gives you a little score. Has some decent UI. You can improve the UI, but if you go back
2:32:48
and forth with it, you're going to get better results. You can see exactly how to do it. So, just to recap here, you can build and deploy apps using Gemini
2:32:54
2.5 Flash directly inside gemini.google.com. If you want to create code and then
2:33:00
preview it, so for example, this p5 js game, then you would create the code directly inside AI studio and then go
2:33:06
over to p5js.editor.org and plug that code in and start playing it. Right? So those are two different
2:33:13
ways that we can use this. Additionally, what we can also do is we can go over to something like client. And by the way,
2:33:20
if you're wondering, okay, how do you set this stuff up or where are all the links, etc. How do you get access to all this stuff? You can just get access to
2:33:26
the full SAP on building and automating with Gemini directly inside the AI success lab link in the comments
2:33:31
description. Basically shows you how to build anything and automate anything with Gemini 2.5. And everything that I'm showing you today has been broken down
2:33:38
into step-by-step tutorials and guides. So you can steal this stuff from me. All right, so let's go back into Visual
2:33:43
Studio Code over here. And then we're going to run a new task. And inside our extension client, we're going to go to
2:33:50
settings, open router, and we're going to select Gemini 2.5 flash preview from the options. Now, client have actually
2:33:57
officially confirmed that flash, the new model is directly inside here.
2:34:03
And you can switch between different APIs as well directly inside the chat here. You can also use Google Gemini 2.5
2:34:10
flash preview thinking mode here as well. And then we can hit save on that. And from here, we can build whatever we
2:34:16
want. So for example, we say just something quick and basic to show you exactly what you can build. Let's say
2:34:22
something like okay build out a and
2:34:27
we'll take some examples from the AI profit boardroom link in the comments in description if you want to join this community with coaching et etc on AI but
2:34:34
we can say here okay create beautifully designed snow calculator optimize for
2:34:40
the keyword actual content on the page and relevant tool right we'll go inside there and then we'll also say right make
2:34:46
this pink gradient fun emoji plus make it
2:34:53
look sleek, modern, and beautiful. Plus add FAQs like then we can hit
2:35:01
enter. Make sure that you've got the right API selected, hit enter, and that's going to start coding out. What
2:35:08
you can also do is inside Root Code, if you paste the same sort of prompt, you can go inside here and you can click the
2:35:13
AI button and that will actually improve the prompt for you if you want to get better prompts or just make your prompts more detailed. But you see how it's
2:35:20
basically instantly building this out, creating the code for us. And we really didn't have to create much work there at
2:35:25
all. Jose Pinto says, "Good one." And that's building this out. Now, we're going to hit run command. We'll open
2:35:31
that up. We've got the SEO snow day calculator built out. Now, being 100%
2:35:36
honest, the UI of this does not look very nice. So, what I would normally do is either I'm going to be very patient
2:35:42
and go back and forth with Gemini Flash for ages or I can switch now to
2:35:47
Anthropic and then inside Anthropic Claw 3.5 Sonet and then inside here we can
2:35:52
say okay make the UI more beautiful, sleek, modern, interesting. All right.
2:35:59
And then Claude 3.7 Sonnet is just a lot better for improving the prompts and
2:36:06
improving the UI on the actual code that you build. All right. So, that's what I'd recommend. Now, we're going to close that because
2:36:12
I've shown you how to build with client. You've seen how to build with Gemini. You know how to build with AI Studio.
2:36:19
What's next? What we can also do is we can go over to NA10 and you can build
2:36:24
out workflows with A10 using Flash as well. Okay. So, if we go inside NA10.io,
2:36:30
this is a really powerful tool for building out automations. So, for example, like I've built out voice
2:36:37
automation, Slack bots, all sorts of agents inside NAN. And if we go inside
2:36:43
create workflow here, we'll just create a little basic example. In fact, what I can do is yeah, create
2:36:50
workflow. Then we can put this as a chat trigger just to show you a really basic example
2:36:55
what we can build. And then we're going to add an AI agent. Inside the AI agent
2:37:02
module, what you want to do is just add chat model. And you could either use like Google Gemini chat model and create
2:37:09
a new credential there. Or we can delete that. So let's close that. And then
2:37:16
inside here, we could select open router. Open router. We can add a credential
2:37:22
inside here. So let me show you how to get that. You're just going to go over to open router. Select keys.
2:37:28
Create API key. Type it in. Copy that. Go over to NA10 again. Paste in the API
2:37:36
key. Hit save. Excel off that. Select the model. And then you can use Gemini
2:37:42
2.5 flash preview 20. And also thinking mode. If you be an agent and it doesn't
2:37:47
require much thinking, you just want instant responses, then you should just use flash preview and you're good to go
2:37:54
on that. So, if we want to test this out, I'm just going to put some system instructions inside the AI agent. So,
2:38:00
let's say you're helpful assistant and we'll say, okay, is 100 * 40. It's
2:38:06
running the AI agent. As you can see, cuz it's flash, it's really good for building out AI agents. And then if we
2:38:12
open this up, it said, here's how to calculate 100* 40. Here's what you do.
2:38:18
And then it's given us the answer right there. All right. So, that's how you can build AI agents as well. So if you want
2:38:23
to just steal that example from me, I'll actually download the JSON and then inside the AI success lab link in the
2:38:30
comments completely free. You can download that JSON from me and you can grab the example agent and all your
2:38:35
agents that you use, you can just switch to flash if you want to as well just by changing the chat model that branches
2:38:43
off as you can see. So just to recap here, we've talked about Gemini and building apps directly in there. We've
2:38:49
talked about AI Studio and how to code with that. We've talked about Visual Studio Code and how to code with that. And we've also talked about how to build
2:38:55
AI agents using NA10 as well. So you can see the power of this and how easy it is
2:39:00
to build out almost anything that you want using Gemini in this process.
2:39:06
Let's keep going now. So what we're going to do from here is we're going to start using something called Bolt DIY.
2:39:13
BoltDIY is like a offline version of Bolt where you can code with it directly
2:39:18
and you can also use Gemini Flash inside here. So if you want to set this up quickly, pretty simple SAP inside the AI
2:39:24
success lab, which is completely free for you to get access. And if we go inside the instructions,
2:39:32
we'll do a direct installation. Paste that in. Then we'll PMP install that.
2:39:37
And literally all you're doing is just copy and paste in, right? It's pretty simple. And then we're just going to do
2:39:43
that. Now, if we need to pull in the latest model from Bolt, we
2:39:49
can just grab this, we can plug that into Claude and say how to set up. And
2:39:54
if you have any issues, like you see over here, we can just go back in here and say, "Okay, help with this."
2:40:02
And then we'll copy this. And what that's going to do is start running Bolt DIY locally. So, we can build with it.
2:40:07
If we copy that local address, then we'll open that up in a new tab. Now you can see we can start coding with bolt.
2:40:13
And if you select open router and then you can choose Gemini 2.5 Pro preview
2:40:19
here and just get access to 2.5 Pro preview to start building stuff out. Right now you just need an API key. So
2:40:27
you can get that from open router. Let's go to keys in the top right. Create API
2:40:32
key. It's good practice is just give it a name you can actually remember. And then we'll copy that code. Go back into
2:40:38
bolt. plug that in and say, "Okay, build a SEO calculator." Right? Something like
2:40:46
that. I'm just showing you basic examples for the video before anyone comments and saying, "This isn't that impressive," etc. And now that should
2:40:53
start coding out. Now, the only issue you're going to have with this is sometimes this runs a little bit slowly
2:41:00
depending on how fast your laptop is, but you can see it coding on the right hand side using Gemini 2.5 Pro preview.
2:41:08
But again, you would just switch to flash preview if you want. So, we can switch to flash preview, which is the
2:41:14
latest model. And then we can say, okay, make the UI beautiful.
2:41:20
And if we select that text and then click on the AI section under here, it will actually improve the prompt so that
2:41:26
we get better outputs. So, let's wait for that to run. As you can see, then we're going to enter. And you can just
2:41:32
improve it as you want, step by step. does take a little bit of back and forth, but honestly the outputs worked first time round, so that's good as
2:41:38
well. And then if you ever want to shut this down, we could just quit the terminal, terminate that. We'll delete
2:41:44
the API key, and we're good to go on that. Right. So, that's basically how you can build anything with Gemini 2.5
2:41:51
Flash, the new versions. So, we've talked about client and Visual Studio Code. We talked about NA10, AI Studio,
2:41:57
Gemini, etc. all the SPS inside the AI success lab if you want to get free access to this plus an awesome community
2:42:02
of 6,700 members that you can ask any questions to. On top of that, if you want to get help, support, tips, etc.
2:42:10
implementing this stuff, feel free to get the AI profit boardroom link in the comments in description. This basically
2:42:16
focuses on just more practical use cases and supports you with trying to implement this stuff. It can get
2:42:21
complicated. You're not sure how to use it. Maybe you need help and support actually implementing it and you're getting some bugs, etc. This is one of
2:42:28
the best places to go to help you support you on your journey towards using AI, saving time, making money with
2:42:34
AI, right? And you can also post inside the community. You can DM us. You can jump on the weekly live calls as you can
2:42:40
see inside the calendar. And also inside the classroom, we have tons of training on all different sorts of agents and our
2:42:46
crash course which is absolutely amazing for learning how we've actually implemented AI in our business to make
2:42:51
money. So feel free to get that link in the comments description. Price is going up next month. So, make sure you lock in your lifetime deal now and I will see
2:42:57
you on the next one. Cheers. Bye. New Gemini 2.5 Pro, how to build anything.
2:43:04
So, today what I'm going to show you is how to build basically anything in many different ways using the latest update
2:43:10
that just came out 24 hours ago from Gemini 2.5 Pro. And the coolest thing about this is actually free to use if
2:43:16
you have the right techniques. I'll show you exactly how to do that. By the way, if you want all of the for the stuff that I show you today, you can get it
2:43:23
inside the AI profit boardroom, just go down to Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro down here,
2:43:28
and you can get access to everything right here, including all these techniques that I'm about to show you. I'm going to show you nine different
2:43:33
ways to build anything that you want using Gemini 2.5 Pro. And we're going to
2:43:38
kick it off with something interesting called Bolt DIY. Now, BoltDIY is a
2:43:45
really power to start using AI to build stuff locally, right? And it's kind of
2:43:52
like Bolt. But bolt new is a paid tool where you have to pay to build SAS or apps or that sort of thing. But you can
2:43:57
actually use it for free directly inside Bolt Local. So, let me show you exactly how to set this up, how it works, etc.
2:44:03
First thing that you're going to do is you're going to go to terminal, right? And then inside terminal, let me show
2:44:08
you how to do this. By the way, if you want access to all this stuff, you want to learn how to do this stuff, get it inside the AI profit boardroom. I've got
2:44:15
full SPs and all this stuff and how to do it right here. And we're just going to get straight into this. All right.
2:44:20
So, if you want to start coding locally with Gemini 2.5 Pro to build apps,
2:44:25
games, tools, etc., then you can use this terminal command like you can see right here. And then we're going to mpm
2:44:32
install like you can see. Just going to paste that in. Then from here, we're going to use this. Right.
2:44:40
Next up, what we're going to do is mpm rum dev. That bad boy. All right. And
2:44:45
then that's just going to start running this boom shaft kalaka. That was easy, wasn't it? Then what we're going to do is we're going to open this up. So this
2:44:51
is running locally now. This is kind of like a free version of bolt new, right? So you don't need to pay for this. It's
2:44:56
completely free to use. And if you select open router in the settings right here, scroll down, you can get access to
2:45:04
the latest version of Google Gemini 2.5 experimental, right? And this is how you
2:45:09
can start coding stuff, right? So you can switch to Google over here, but I can't see 2.5 Pro experimental in the
2:45:16
list. So the best way to use this start coding with the API key, which is going to connect Google and its AI to bolt new
2:45:24
bolt.local. Then you just select Gemini Pro 2.5
2:45:29
experimental for free down here. And then what we need to do from this part is start getting an API key and plugging
2:45:35
it in. Right? So you see where it says open router API key. That's where we're going to get an API key and plug this in. Now if you want to get an API key,
2:45:42
pretty simple stuff. So you're going to go to open router.ai and you can get a free API key and then use this for free.
2:45:48
All right. So if you go to the key section over here, we can just click create a key. I'll do that off screen. And then from here we can start getting
2:45:55
into the magic of coding with bolt local. Now even it for example sometimes
2:46:01
with these APIs they don't work right? So you know if it's a beta or if it's just been released like 24 hours ago
2:46:07
sometimes these don't work. But I'm going to plug in this API key. Hopefully it'll work. And if it doesn't I'll show you other ways to do this in a sec.
2:46:12
Right? So if we say build a to-do list app inside here. All right. We're using
2:46:18
Google Gemini Pro 2.5 experimental. This is starting to build out our our app
2:46:24
that we asked it to develop. Right? And you see how fast it is, how easy it is to do using Bolt Local, sorry, Bolt DIY.
2:46:32
And bear in mind, right, if we go onto Bolt.new. So that's the to-do list. We'll come to
2:46:38
that in a second. But if we go to Bolt new, you have to pay, right? So if you go to my subscription here, if you want
2:46:44
10 million tokens, it's $20 a month. You want $26 million tokens, $50 a month.
2:46:50
120 million tokens, $200 a month, right? But if you want very similar functionality completely for free with a
2:46:56
free API, then just set up Bolt DIY. And you've seen how I set it up in 2 seconds. If you want the instructions
2:47:01
for setting that up, it's inside the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description. So from here, we can start
2:47:07
building whatever we want, right? So for example, I've got a to-do list app right here. We type in whatever we want,
2:47:13
right? Figure out Gem Line Pro. Bang it in. We got the list ready to go. Right?
2:47:18
And then if you want to for example host this stuff right then what you can do is
2:47:24
you can go back to code over here you download the code right so that's our folder our react folder and then what we
2:47:32
can do from here with that code that we just created is we can actually host it and we can host it for free on a
2:47:37
subdomain. So, if you want to host it for free on a subdomain, you're going to go to netlifi.com and then you're going
2:47:42
to go from here and you're going to click on import an existing project, try netifi drop, and then just drag and drop
2:47:47
that folder that you just downloaded from Bolt Local. Right? How easy is that? So, incredibly easy, not just to
2:47:53
build your own app, not just to do it for free, not just to get free access to bold.local, but also to get this bad boy
2:48:00
deployed on a on a subdomain. Pretty crazy stuff. And that literally just
2:48:05
took us like 1 minute or so. So you can see how easy this is, how powerful it is, etc. And you can do it in the space
2:48:12
of like literally minutes to get this stuff deployed and hosted and that sort of thing. If you wanted to build a game or app or whatever, if we go back to Bob
2:48:19
DIY here, we can also switch between API keys. So if you want to test stuff out, there's loads of free stuff here. So if
2:48:25
you go down the list, you'll see there's a lot of free ones. So for example, like Llama 3 AB preview is free. All these
2:48:32
ones with brackets and then free, these are free API keys that you can just play with. But I would recommend Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. It is probably the most
2:48:40
powerful API key in the world and you can get access to it for free, right, for cod and stuff. So unbelievably
2:48:45
powerful. Build the best SEO cost calculator you can with a sleek modern
2:48:52
design. Wait for that to load. You can build tools, you can build apps, you can build games, calculators, etc., whatever
2:48:59
you want. And it is super super fast. I also find like this is a lot more reliable than other API keys that are
2:49:05
free, right? So, for example, if you try and use the Deepseek 3.1 API from Open
2:49:10
Router, it's a little bit slow sometimes, right? Doesn't always do what you want it to do. It's a little bit temperamental. Whereas, for example,
2:49:17
when you're using a process like this, it's simple. It's easy. It doesn't take a long time. And literally, in one
2:49:23
prompt, you've got that ready to go. Look at that. Right. Here we go. Boom. Shaka. All right. And then we got the
2:49:31
SEO cost calculator. You select your services. gives you the estimate monthly cost. Something that you would hire a
2:49:36
team of developers to build and spend thousands of dollars, you can now do for free using Bolt DIY. And that is just
2:49:43
one of the methods that I'm going to show you today. We've got many more to get through, my friends. And again, Saps
2:49:48
are inside here. So, the next method that I'm going to show you is on client. Now, client is a free extension inside
2:49:56
Visual Studio Code. All right? So, if you go to visualstudio.com, download this, right? And then what
2:50:02
you're going to do is open this up in Visual Studio Code. That's going to open up something that looks like this. Then
2:50:09
inside the extensions marketplace. So click over here, type in client. Allow that. And you can install I would
2:50:16
recommend installing client and root code. These are two different ways to code. Root code is super powerful cuz you can actually use like computer use
2:50:22
with it as well, which is pretty insane. And also client is really good as well. I like both of those extensions. I think
2:50:28
they're great. And then inside the settings once you've got client installed. So you can see client on the left hand side here. Then you're going
2:50:33
to go inside the settings and then you can input a Google Gemini key like you
2:50:38
can see right here from the list. You will not find Gemini 2.5. Right? So if
2:50:44
you want to use Gemini 2.5 instead what you want to do is go to open router and
2:50:50
then inside open router we're going to put 2.5 and we'll look for Google Gemini
2:50:57
2.5. Let's have a look what we got here. Yeah, there you go. All right. So, you can just find it from the list right
2:51:02
there. Let's have a look. Yeah, Gemini. It's called So, it's called Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 03-25
2:51:10
colon free. So, it's free. It's available inside open router. You can use it inside client. And then, you
2:51:15
know, you can use the same prompts you use inside Bolt. So, if we go back to bolt over here, I'm just going to shut this down because that's probably taking
2:51:22
up a fair bit of memory in the old bolt. All right. So, we'll leave that for now. And that is terminated on the local
2:51:27
host. But we can always go back to the old chats if we run it again. So what we can do from here is we can say now build
2:51:34
an SEO cost calculator. So you can do very similar stuff inside client. But here's what I would say. It's like when
2:51:40
you're using client, client is a lot slower for building stuff out inside client versus using bolt.local. So if
2:51:47
you saw the way that I coded bolt.local previously on bolt, way faster whereas
2:51:52
if you're using client or root code, it's going to take a bit more time. And I think it's because it's updating files locally. And I think as well because
2:51:58
it's running it through the custom instructions that are set up in the settings as well. So you see how it's like writing the content for the page
2:52:04
and it's creating all the content and text for the page as well. Analyzing stuff. I think Gemini Pro is probably
2:52:10
your best bet. Some people are asking like can you use for example for trading and analyzing can you use Deep Seek 3.1?
2:52:17
I wouldn't recommend it cuz Deepseek 3.1 is a base model not a reasoning model. What that means is it's not as good at
2:52:24
thinking and reasoning and logic and coding as something as analytical as Gemini 2.5 Pro. So I would rather use
2:52:32
Gemini 2.5 Pro for analyzing and that sort of thing. Right? So we're coding that out. We're building out websites
2:52:38
using client. You can do exactly the same thing inside code as well. So if you switch to R code here, you know,
2:52:43
this is method number three. You can do exactly the same thing. Again, you would select from the list. You can use
2:52:49
deepseek if you want but again I would always prefer to use Gemini 2.5 Pro and
2:52:54
again you select it from the list hit save. Done. Right. The difference one of the biggest differences between Klein
2:53:01
and Root Code is that Root Code is easier to install MCP servers. Right? So
2:53:09
if you go inside the MCP section over here, it has this MCP server section and then you can see which MCP servers are
2:53:15
running. Right? I'm just going to delete that one for now. But you can see we're using like Plexi ask right here. So we can connect RC code directly to Plexi.
2:53:23
So the way they use MCP servers is very different, right? Whereas if we go over to client, they actually have an MCP
2:53:30
servers marketplace. And then you can use the Gemini 2.5 Pro API to install
2:53:37
MCP servers such as connecting it to stuff like Google Calendar, Discord.
2:53:42
I've connected it to Plexi. OAM is another good one. There's lots of good stuff right there. And this is
2:53:47
completely free, right? So just to recap here, we've talked about three different methods. All right, we've talked about
2:53:54
using bolt local, which is free and you can build anything using that. You can also, for example, use client brew code.
2:54:01
These are many different options. All right, let's keep going down the list cuz we got a lot to get through here, peeps. All right, so this is something
2:54:10
that I'm going to recommend called make.com. Make.com is really good for like linear workflows. All right. So,
2:54:15
you can build like AI agents using make.com. And I'm just going to grab a password
2:54:21
here. All right. We'll plug that in. And we'll log in to make.com. Wait for that
2:54:27
to load. And what we can do is build like AI agents with Gemini 2.5 Pro. All right. So, let me show you an example of
2:54:34
what we built yesterday using similar sort of processes. So, for example,
2:54:39
we've got where have we got it here? So, we've got tools like this. This is actually made with DeepSeek, but we can
2:54:45
duplicate it. So, I'm going to clone this right now. Call this Gemini 2.5
2:54:50
Content Creator. Copy. All right. Hit save. And then what we're doing is we're taking keywords from a spreadsheet,
2:54:56
plugging that for Open Router, sending to WordPress. All right. Now, inside the settings for Open Router here, we have
2:55:03
the prompt for generating the content. We have this connected to Open Router. And then we're just going to scroll down
2:55:09
here. And instead of using Deep Sea V3, I'm going to switch this over to Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. Right there, you
2:55:16
can see it. We're going to hit save. So again, you would just add your open router connection, your WordPress
2:55:22
connection, and your Google Sheet connection insidemate.com. And you can build like oneclick AI agents using this
2:55:28
process as well. So this is method number four for using Gemini 2.5 Pro. And then for example, if we choose where
2:55:33
to start over here, we're going to choose manually from our spreadsheet of keywords. This is an AI SEO content
2:55:39
writer. You can use this for whatever you want, right? Like you could take keywords and then plug it through open
2:55:44
router and then do tweets or LinkedIn content. You could automate emails. You could fire off emails to to potential
2:55:52
prospects, whatever you want. Okay, we're going to hit save on that and then we're going to hit run once and then we
2:55:58
can start using this process. Now, let's have a look here. What's going on here? Why have we not why is this not working?
2:56:03
I'm just going to switch my open router connection. Make sure we're using the right model. We'll test that again.
2:56:09
There we go. All right. So, that's working nicely. Now, if you want to see an example of the output, think of this
2:56:14
is because the other API connection that I had inside open router was the old
2:56:20
connection and I've actually deleted the API key since then. So, if we log into my WordPress over here, whilst we're
2:56:26
waiting for that to load, I'll show you some examples of what I did yesterday using the exact same process. So, here's
2:56:32
a Gemini Pro experimental example. We're going to click on preview. We've got the content and then you can see it's just
2:56:38
created like a nicely formatted blog. Reads pretty nicely. It's interesting. It's all targeted to the keyword we
2:56:44
wanted to write SEO content about. And this was free. Right? Make.com is free for a thousand operations. Google Sheets
2:56:51
is free to use. WordPress is free to use. Open is free to use. And it's using the latest API keys from Gemini. Right.
2:56:57
Now, if we take that and we'll go over to Z GPT, we'll plug that in and we'll just check the AI detectability on that.
2:57:05
Is it AI detectable? No. Zero GPT, which is an AI detector is free and it is
2:57:13
detecting this is 100% 98% human written. It says your text is human written, right? So, automated content.
2:57:19
It's all customized to us, nicely formatted, doesn't cost us anything. We did it in one click and it all links out
2:57:25
to our personalized funnels like you see right here. Right? Pretty amazing stuff. Plus, it can publish automatically for
2:57:30
us as well if you want. So, that's how the whole process works. You can see it worked quite cleanly there. And if you
2:57:36
want my best automations for that, go inside the AI profit boardroom. We've got like a whole module on make.com
2:57:41
automations and there's 12 different templates you can get inside there. So, make sure you get that stuff. All right.
2:57:48
So just to recap, we've talked about BoltDIY, Klein, Rode, we've talked about make.com. You can also just go directly
2:57:54
inside the chat, right? So if you go to a studio.google.com and then you select gemini 2.5 Pro
2:58:00
Experimental over here, create a prompt. You can just build whatever you want inside here. Now, if you want to see an
2:58:06
example of that, let me show you an example right here. So I'm just going to go through the library. What else we
2:58:12
got? Yeah. So I created like a pixelated dinosaur game yesterday, right? So here
2:58:18
you can see the code. I just went to Gemini 2.5 Pro. I said, "Make me a
2:58:24
captivating endless runner game blah blah blah. Do it in 5JS." It gave us a code right here. We can copy that. So
2:58:32
we'll copy that to clipboard. And then it even gives us the instructions on how to get this set up.
2:58:38
So if we scroll up here, we're going to go to editor.p5js.org.
2:58:44
Let's go to that website. Copy that. We'll paste in the code. We'll hit play. Boom. Game built. Right. Pixelated
2:58:51
dinosaur game. Live in the dream, sunshine. All right. And you can now build games as well for free with Gemini
2:58:59
2.5 Pro. So that's another method as well. Like you got so many different options right here. Choose the one that
2:59:04
works the best for you. Depends on what you're building as well, right? So for example, if you just want to build a simple game, then you're probably going
2:59:10
to use something like AI Studio. If you need to build like a really big website, you're probably going to use client or
2:59:16
root code for that. If you want to build out a SAS app like super fast, then all you need to do is you can just go over
2:59:24
to Bolt Local and just build that out for free, right? So many different options depending on what you want. If
2:59:30
you have a linear automation like this and you need to post from one platform to another one, then make.com is really
2:59:36
good for that. Next up, what I want to show you is browser agent web UI. All right. Now, I've actually set this up
2:59:43
with Deep Seek. The instructions are inside the AI profit boardroom, but you don't need to use Deep Seek. You can use
2:59:49
Gemini 2.5 Pro. And then I'm going to show you an example video tutorial of this so you can see exactly how it runs.
2:59:57
I'm not going to show it live on this video cuz it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to set up. All right, but you
3:00:03
can basically set up browser web UI like you can see right here. You would plug in the LM provider as Google, not as O
3:00:12
Lama, right? And then like you can see right here, it can just go off and start
3:00:17
doing stuff for you. All right, so check out that video. It's on YouTube. You can see how the AI analyzes the page. The
3:00:22
good thing about Google's Gemini model as well is it's a vision based model, so it can do its magic just like that. And
3:00:28
again, instructions inside the AI profit boardroom. Next up, what I want to show you is you can use deep research agents,
3:00:35
right? So if you want to build like really in-depth research reports, you can go to deep research inside Gemini.
3:00:40
This is another free feature as well. It's not necessarily using Gemini 2.5 Pro, but if you need like the best
3:00:46
research, better than a human, faster than a human, this is how you do it, right? So for example, if we say, okay,
3:00:52
research the latest chat GBT40 image update, it
3:00:59
should start working its magic. And the cool thing about this is you got everything inside one ecosystem, right?
3:01:05
So, for example, you need to do deep research, boom, there you go. You need to do something like personalization
3:01:12
based on your search history. Boom, there you go. If you want to build out some tasks with like maybe a website or
3:01:18
a SAS or a landing page, then just go to 2.0 Flash and use the canvas feature. Like everything is what in one side, one
3:01:25
one ecosystem, one place. And that's the beauty of this is you're not going from place to place and messing around like
3:01:31
that. So, if we hit start research like so, we can build out these deep research AI agents that can just go off search
3:01:37
the internet. We can leave that tab running in the background as well if it's taking too long for you. And then
3:01:42
we can just go off and do that. All right. The final two methods I want to
3:01:47
show you cuz I've shown you all these different methods already. Number one is
3:01:53
using NA10, right? So if we go over to NA10 over here, you can actually create
3:01:58
AI agents directly inside NA10. And these are kind of like oneclick chat bots or workflows where you can connect
3:02:05
different apps to each other. Difference between say something like NA10 and make.com is that NA10 is not linear,
3:02:11
right? And you can build your own chat bots inside it. Whereas make.com is very like you go from point A to point B,
3:02:17
boom, straight line, right? So for example, let's have a look at this workflow that I actually built out
3:02:22
yesterday. If we have a look at this one, I'm just going to check the open rout to chat model and we're going to select instead over here Gemini 2.5.
3:02:31
Let's have a look here. Put 2.5 Pro. Yeah, there we go. So, you're going to select Gemini 2.5 Pro Expand
3:02:37
Experimental. You see, right inside the AI model and we have an AI agent where
3:02:43
you can essentially like automate sending emails or going back and forth inside the chat. You can also add a memory in here as well. So you can add a
3:02:50
memory that allows it to remember previous messages so that it remembers stuff that's going on. If you want to
3:02:56
publish this, you can also make this chat publicly available. Grab that URL, publish the workflow, and you've got a
3:03:03
chatbot that you can share with the world or embed to your website, etc. And then if we go inside the chat here, we'll say, "All right, we send a message
3:03:11
to me at julianoldie.com telling there's new ways to build
3:03:17
anything you want with Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental.
3:03:22
And then I'll list out all these different methods here using this. Keep it fun plus conversation." And then from
3:03:30
there, we can start building this out. The other way that we can do this, we can delete the open router chat model if the API key doesn't work. I told you it'
3:03:36
be temperamental sometimes. Right. So if that's if you're having any problems with that, you can add inside here.
3:03:43
Let's X off that. What are you doing, mate? All right. Click on chat model over here. Click on Google Gemini chat
3:03:48
model. And then you can select 2.5 Pro Experimental. Give you the same chat
3:03:55
message. And now it's using Google Gemini to generate that response like you can see. So the chat model is
3:04:01
working. Actually what's interesting is you go inside Visual Studio Code and client and open router works perfectly
3:04:08
with Gemini. Whereas for example if you go over to NA10 and try and do the same thing. It's better to have a Google
3:04:13
Gemini chat head from what I can see because that API key worked perfectly first time round. Right. So we're good
3:04:19
to go on that. I'm going to hit save on that. If you want to download this template from me, if you want to just
3:04:24
steal this stuff from me, I'm going to download that and I'll plug it into this section right here. So, add a new
3:04:31
resource file. And if you want to just import this workflow, it's waiting for you right there. And it's an example,
3:04:38
we'll hit save. Boom. There you go. All right. And then if we check our emails
3:04:45
in the send box, here we go. Look at that. Send it right there. The only thing that I would say here is make sure
3:04:50
you write it in HTML and make sure the output is in HTML as well because then the formatting is going to be much nicer. You get the point, right? If I
3:04:58
say write it and send it in HTML, hopefully the formatting will be much
3:05:03
better this time. So, let's wait for that to load. And again, like you can connect this to any tool. I'm just
3:05:09
giving you a quick example for the video. If you want to see all my best templates for this stuff, type in NA10
3:05:15
into the AI profit boardroom search feature here. And then you'll see all these NAN Asian workflows. Like you see
3:05:21
all these different resources here. We've got loads of different AI agents. Like you can see here as well. NA10
3:05:28
sales agents. Like it's not limited to just sending emails. It's just for the sake of this video that I do that.
3:05:34
Right. So if we go back now to NAN should have sent. Let's double check the
3:05:40
send messages here. Yeah, there we go. Look at that. Beautiful. Couldn't have written that title better myself. That's
3:05:46
a perfect one for YouTube, right? That's ready to go. And then you can see it's just written it nicely formatted. So, just make sure you output it in HTML
3:05:52
inside the prompt settings. And then it's standard magic, isn't it? And then we've got the deep research report ready
3:05:59
to go. Back enable ready there. So, that's pretty cool. All right. So, this
3:06:04
is the deep research report we were talking about earlier. It takes about 5 10 minutes to go and then we're good to go on that. And the final method that I
3:06:12
want to show you, all right, in a long video, this one been through a lot of different methods to build anything with
3:06:18
Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, what you going to do with this app right here is you can
3:06:23
select inside the models Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. And then we can say build
3:06:28
me a calculator app like you can see. We'll hit enter over there. and it will
3:06:34
just build out the app. Kind of similar to Bolt Local, but it's not going to be as big a product with as many different
3:06:40
features, right? And it might take a little bit longer, but yeah, you can see how you can just get started with this.
3:06:46
The good thing about this is like you don't need to use a terminal to just get this all set up and you can turn your idea into an app for free using this
3:06:52
process. How easy was that? So, there you go. You got the calculator. It's a better designed calculator than Windows
3:06:59
used to have a few years ago, to be honest with you. And you just did it with AI. Boom. Right. If you open up the sandbox as well, we can open this up and
3:07:06
we've got the code ready to go. There we go. Right. So, we've talked about nine different ways to build anything that
3:07:11
you want with Gemini 2.5 Pro. All the SPS are inside the ARI profit boardroom, including all the instructions, NA10

3:08:30
like you can see right here right feel free to get that link in the comments description completely free for you my
3:08:36
friends Gemini 2.5 the new update as you can see right here versus Claude versus
3:08:43
Chat GBT who wins we're going to be comparing them side by side and testing which ones are the best got a bunch of
3:08:50
different tests and use cases to check this through. Let's see how it goes. All right. First thing that we're going to do is we're going to test this prompt
3:08:58
right here for writing content. All right. So, we're going to say write a 2,000word article. The feature of AI agents, the impact on automation, etc.
3:09:04
And we'll hit this into each option like you can see right here. All right. So, we're going to be testing this out
3:09:09
versus each of these models. Use chat GPT4 cuz that's kind of like the default one for writing inside chat GPT. And
3:09:15
then we'll see which one comes back with the outputs and performs the best. First thing I would say is Grock has come back
3:09:21
to us and seems to be the fastest. But actually, if you look at the content itself, look at those big walls of text.
3:09:26
Look at the way it's written, right? Would anyone actually read that block? And so for me, that's one of the worst
3:09:33
that I've seen so far. Let's have a look what we got here from chat GBT40.
3:09:39
So this is pretty nice the way it's written. So what is an AI agent? It's dumb down the language, made it nicely formatted, made it really easy to read
3:09:46
as you can see right here, and that's performing pretty well. I'm playing English, an AI agent and software that takes action for you based on goals and
3:09:51
prompts. You an objective, it decides what to do next. Pretty nicely written. Feels very humanized. It's still writing
3:09:57
out, but you can see how fast it is. And it's also doing like the 2,000 words you ask it to. So that is doing a great job.
3:10:03
Let's have a look at Claude. Claude is one of my favorite ones if you give it the right prompt. But if you give it a prompt like this, look at this. Just
3:10:09
really long, boring walls of text. I'm going to put that as coming in third. I
3:10:14
think maybe slightly better than Grock, but not as good as Chat GP. And then we
3:10:19
got Gemini's written the blog here, but that is more like a deep research report, right? Who would read that? And
3:10:26
so out of all them, I'm going to say that Chat GT is winning by a long way, right? Long, long way. So when it comes
3:10:31
to writing, pretty good. Now, one thing that I would just note here is if you
3:10:38
give it the right prompt, I've got this prompt inside the AI profit boardroom here. If you give it a better prompt, Claude is actually pretty good for
3:10:45
writing. But it seems like if you don't have the right prompts in place, look at how bad that is compared to the output
3:10:51
from chat GPT that required basically no prompting at all. Huge difference right
3:10:56
there. All right. So, next up, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go into
3:11:01
each and I'm going to say, "Okay, new chat, create a beautiful
3:11:08
landing page for my SEO agency's website." All right.
3:11:14
Now, one thing to note here is if you want to use Gemini 2.5 Pro for free, you
3:11:19
can do that inside AI Studio. Go to create prompt, then select Gemini 2.5 Pro, and you can get access to this for
3:11:25
free. All right. So, you know, that's one of the other options I would say here is all of these models are free up
3:11:31
to a limit, but actually if you use AI Studio, that doesn't seem to have a limit. Like, you can use it for free as
3:11:37
much as you want, peeps. All right. So, we're going to go back here now. We'll do the same inside Grock as well. The
3:11:45
cool thing about Claude is it has a canvas option. So does chat GPT. And let's go back here. What we're
3:11:52
actually going to do is use 2.0 Oh, flash for generating this inside Google cuz that's a canvas option. We'll hit
3:11:58
enter and we'll see what we get back in a second. All right, so now we've got the code back from chat GPT. Let's run
3:12:04
this. See how it looks. It's not bad. The content itself actually reads really
3:12:09
well, right? That's better written than most people. It's got a nice little CCA to put in your website URL, nicely designed icons. I don't like the front
3:12:16
end so much cuz it's super boring in terms of the way that it's done. Claude is still writing. Brock didn't even
3:12:23
figure out we need HTML. So that's gonna finish last again for me to be honest. It's been a brutal test for Grock
3:12:29
already to be honest with you. And we're going to keep going through this. So you can see the output from Grock here. It
3:12:36
said I can't directly generate HTML or CSS, which is mad because Grock can,
3:12:41
right? It genuinely can, but it's refusing to. So Grock has to come last on that test. It's just no good. I don't
3:12:48
know why, but Gemini is written in Chinese characters. The design is pretty
3:12:54
nice, but for some reason, it's written it all in Chinese. Why? Why have you done that? I've never seen that before.
3:13:00
All right, let's go back to chat. GBT is winning just by default for writing in English. But look at that from Claude.
3:13:08
Claude has created the best so far. Nicely designed, looks really cool, good
3:13:15
UI. I like the color gradients on it. Nice copy as well. So, dominate search
3:13:20
results with datadriven SEO. Really nice headline. So, in this order, here's what I'm going to say. Claude has won that by
3:13:28
a long way. Chat GPT comes in second. Not bad at all. It just could do a bit
3:13:33
of color on the page, but you could always go back in the chat right there. Gemini totally failed and gave us something in Chinese, and I still don't
3:13:40
understand why. That's a bit mad. And then Grock said, "I can't create HTML
3:13:45
for you." Even though it's got a preview section inside Grock 3 for HTML, it just
3:13:51
didn't understand. Right? So, out of all these, he's going to go Claude, I would say, for doing this stuff, which is
3:13:56
crazy. I don't understand. Like, Grock seems to have got worse or something like that. So, let's keep going now. And
3:14:03
next up, what we're going to do is we're actually going to use a prompt from the AI profit boardroom for creating games.
3:14:11
All right. So, we're going to go inside the classroom here. And I've already done this inside AI Studio. So, I don't
3:14:16
need to do this with Gemini 2.5 Pro yet, but I will do it with the rest. Okay.
3:14:22
So, we're going to go inside Claude here and I'm going to say, "Make me a captivating endless runner again. Key instructions on screen. Use P5 JSON
3:14:29
HTML. Pixelated dinosaur and interesting backgrounds." Right. We'll use the same inside Chia Chiba T40 Grock. I just I
3:14:36
don't know what it's going to come back to me with. Oh, yeah. Look, it's actually doing its magic now. That is surprising. And then if you want to see
3:14:42
the output from Gemini 2.5 Pro that I've already done. Let me come back to this
3:14:49
right here. So this is the prompt that I used yesterday. We'll scroll down and we will get this code and I'll show you
3:14:57
what we got back from Gemini 2.5 Pro. All right. So if you want to preview code like this, if you're using the same
3:15:02
prompts as me, you can plug this into editor.p5js.org.
3:15:07
And then inside here, we can hit play. And you can see that we've got this bad
3:15:13
boy ready to go. All right. Looks pretty cool. Nice little game. Functions perfectly. Quite addictive. And we've
3:15:20
got the score racking up in the top right over there. And then it works perfectly. If we want to restart, we press enter. Press space to start here.
3:15:27
Boom. Beautiful. All right. Really good from Google Gemini. So, they've done a
3:15:34
great job there. Claude is still coming back to us. Chat GPT has come back now. So, let's see what we got back from chat
3:15:41
GPT. We'll copy the code and we'll test this one. So, this is the code from chat GPT. Let's see what we got back. What is
3:15:48
that UI? I can't jump or anything. It says, yeah, that's pretty poor. That is not a dinosaur, mate. Not a pixelated
3:15:55
dinosaur and definitely not a dinosaur. Claude is still coding it out. So, wait for that. And we have the code back from
3:16:02
Grock 3 as well. So, let's see what we get back here. So far, Gemini is winning by a long way.
3:16:09
The UI is not quite as nice here. You see how it's green on green, but it works. It's definitely better than chat
3:16:15
GBT's option. It's better. It's not quite as fast and as smooth. If you look at the UI of this versus the UI of
3:16:21
Gemini, this looks a lot nicer to be fair to it. So far, what I would say is
3:16:28
that Gro is coming in second. So far, Gemini is winning. Chat GBT, I didn't
3:16:35
like the UI at all. Let's have a look what we got back from Claude. Is it opening up? It's giving us a preview,
3:16:42
but there's nothing inside the preview, which is strange. All right, so we're just going to copy this code, and we'll
3:16:49
go to p5 js and just preview this again. Let's see how Claude performed.
3:16:54
Pixelated Dino Runner. Let's test it out. Not bad, actually. That is a hard
3:17:00
game to play, though. Look at that. How are you meant to That's hard, mate.
3:17:05
Yeah, I like it though. Not going to lie to you. So, I would say if it was
3:17:10
actually beatable, cuz it seems like it's almost impossible to beat that, then I would probably put that number one or joint first. I would say that
3:17:17
Claude and Gemini did a fantastic job there. Gro's output was okay. Mediocre.
3:17:24
I'm going to put that at number three. Chat GPT's UI pretty terrible. It's just a block with a bit of text, right? Not
3:17:31
great. So you can see who's winning there and who won the game right there. All right. So let's keep going through
3:17:37
now. So we've tested it for content writing, for coding out landing pages. We've tested each of these models for
3:17:45
creating content and also building out games as well. What are we going to do
3:17:51
next? So the next one that we're going to do is this is going to be kind of like a reasoning test. So, we're going
3:17:57
to go inside Claude and reset for each one here. Switch back to 2.5 Pro
3:18:02
experimental inside Google and we say there's a tree on the other side of a river in winter. How can I pick an apple? It's a reasoning test. And what
3:18:09
we're trying to do here is figure out, okay, which one is the best for reasoning logic? Which one gives us the best solutions? And which one most
3:18:15
intelligently looks up problem and then gives us solutions, right? So, we're just waiting for each one to come back
3:18:21
to us right now and we'll see who performs best. So let's see what we got here. All right. So it's recognized that
3:18:29
the biggest challenge is apples and winter. So obviously in winter if you're trying to pick trees on the other side
3:18:34
of a river, it's not going to be ideal, right? Because quite likely even if you cross the river, there's going to be no
3:18:41
apples in winter. So it's figured that out. It's analyzed the situation really well and it's given us a bunch of
3:18:47
solutions right here. Pretty good. Let's check out now. Claude has recognized the same, but it doesn't analyze it in the
3:18:53
same level of depth, right? So for example, if you compare Gemini 2.5 Pro, he's really thought about it. He's given
3:18:58
us a really in-depth answer. It's analyzed all the problems and solutions and the conclusion, etc. I would say
3:19:04
Claude doesn't do that in as much detail. If we have a look at Grock, it's
3:19:09
recognized typically don't grow in winter. But I don't like the way the the
3:19:15
answer is not logically set out. Right? So if you look at you've got these titles, it's really easy to read. I
3:19:21
honestly I think that Grock has been tuned down in terms of its reasoning. Like it just doesn't seem to be as
3:19:26
powerful as it was when it was first released. I would say that is harder to read than this one right here. And it's
3:19:32
just not as logical as well reasoned out. And let's have a look at chat GPT.
3:19:37
So let's break this down. It's an apple. There's a tree. It's across a river. It's winter. So let's look through it
3:19:45
step by step. But the biggest problem here is it's not figured out that
3:19:50
there's actually no tree. There's no apples in winter on the tree, right? It's not figured that out when it's done
3:19:56
all this analyzing. So, if I had to put these in order, I'm going to go with Gemini, then Claude, then Gro 3, and
3:20:03
Chat GBT40 comes last. Now, if we wanted to give this a fairer way of comparing
3:20:10
each model, then what I would actually recommend doing is you switch to 01 and use one of the reasoning models. And to
3:20:15
be honest, if we did that, we probably get much better outputs. But I believe
3:20:21
doesn't chat GPTO. Let me have a look at this. No. So, yeah, if you wanted to switch this over to, for example, 03
3:20:28
mini, let's test it out now and we'll see if that figures out. So, we're using chat cheapy 03 mini. He's going to use
3:20:34
his remod reasoning model to figure this out. That's even worse, isn't it? Look
3:20:39
at the quality and responses of chat cheapy 03 mini versus Gemini. Like it
3:20:46
it's totally night and day. So let's have a look here. Says worried about crossing a cold icy river in winter.
3:20:51
Wondering blah blah blah. And it still doesn't recognize that there's no apples
3:20:57
on a tree in winter. All right. So chat cheap I mean using the most powerful reason model it has is not as powerful
3:21:04
as Gemini 2.5 advanced right so again chat cheapy comes in last whether you're using GT40 or whether you're using mini
3:21:12
still down my friends all right so you can see the
3:21:17
difference between the models how well they perform etc the other thing is as well inside chat GPT40 we're going to
3:21:24
test this out now this is a really interesting test so we can do step by step we're going to do a test I actually
3:21:30
used this morning using chat and the new image generation method. All right. Now,
3:21:36
Claude automatically fails on this test or isn't even in the race here because it cannot generate images. So, you can't
3:21:42
even count Claude at this point, right? But what we can do is we can test each
3:21:48
of these models and chat is given me a really good option right here for image
3:21:53
generation. All right. So what we're going to do inside Grock is we're going to use exactly the same prompt we use
3:21:58
inside chat GPT and we said create a landscape YouTube thumbnail like this but it should be regarding the end of
3:22:04
designers about new chat update that means we don't need designers anymore and I'm going to plug this in across each of the models right so the output
3:22:12
from chat was top class I've never seen anything as good as this from any other AI model it was unbelievable really
3:22:18
powerful just from the newest update from chat cheapy let's do the same thing inside gro All right. So, if we go
3:22:25
inside Grock here, and we'll just we'll start a new chat just to keep things
3:22:30
fresh. We'll grab that image that we use inside the chat GBT prompt. We're going
3:22:35
to use that inside Gemini. Obviously, Claude is out the race and we'll see how
3:22:40
it does. All right, this one might take a minute or so whilst we're waiting. And
3:22:46
from what I can see, the output from Gemini 2.5, not very good. Not very good
3:22:53
at all. If we compare what we should have got versus what actually came back,
3:22:58
not that great. If we use maybe we use like the actual main version 2.0 flash. Let's test that again. So I'm going to
3:23:05
re retest this. Grock as well is not done anything near as good as chat GPT. Right? Look at the output from chat GBT
3:23:12
versus the output from Grock. This is I can't use that. You know what I mean? Can't use that. So you can see the
3:23:19
differences here. And you can see that Grock is nowhere near the same level as chat GBT. Let's have a look at Gemini
3:23:25
and we'll use 2.0 Flash instead. So, we'll use exactly the same prompt. Let's grab the image over here. Plug that into
3:23:31
Gemini and then we'll do the same thing and see what we get back. Yeah, look at
3:23:37
that. It's just come back with a text message. Where's the image, mate? So, not great there. Yeah, if you compare
3:23:43
all the models here, 2.5 Pro's response was pretty poor. Grock didn't create
3:23:49
anything near the same level of quality and Claude obviously can't do that at
3:23:55
all. So, hands down, Chachi PT delivers like designer level quality responses,
3:24:01
right? Like I can just download that, boom, upload it to YouTube, it's over. It's game over. You don't need a
3:24:07
designer, right? That's the biggest difference here. And I think whatever you use for images, cheapo is like the
3:24:14
new standard for all this stuff. So, thanks so much for watching. If you want to get access to my best prompts, tips,

stuff, go backwards and forwards. All right. And it's really easy to build this stuff out, right? I think it's just
3:26:11
bugged out completely there, but you get the point. So, let me show you exactly how to build it. And this is based on
3:26:17
the new update that just came out like a couple of days ago from Gemini 2.5 Pro. I think honestly most people don't
3:26:23
understand how powerful this is and how much of a game changer it is, right? It's it's totally changed everything
3:26:30
because not only is this like an awesome thinking model, not only is it beating, for example, powerful AI models like
3:26:36
Claude in its benchmarks, but it's also incredibly powerful for like building out coding and taking an idea that you
3:26:44
have in your head and turning it into reality, right? So, you can see it in terms of the benchmarks here. It's pretty much outperforming all the main
3:26:50
models for most of the benchmarks here. So for example like humanity's last exam or Amy maths test is outperforming some
3:26:57
of the most powerful models in the world but at the same time it is completely free to use right so if you want to go
3:27:02
to a studio.google.com you can click on create prompt and then from here you can just type in your prompt and whatever
3:27:08
you want to do. The other way that you can do this is you can grab an API key like you see right here. Then we can
3:27:14
navigate to something like Visual Studio Code. And inside Visual Studio Code, we
3:27:19
can start coding with the API inside extensions like client and ruode. Right?
3:27:24
So if we go to the settings over here, we can select to open router Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. And it's
3:27:30
free. Doesn't cost you anything, but it's the best AI model in the world. How is that possible? And yeah, you can use
3:27:36
it completely free inside a studio. The other thing to note here is if you
3:27:41
go into gemini.google google.com/app. That's going to be paid, right? So, you
3:27:47
have to pay for the model inside Gemini Advanced if you want to use 2.5 Pro Experimental. Don't do that. Instead, do
3:27:54
this. Go to AI Studio, go to create prompt, and then in the model section over here, go to Gemini 2.5 Pro
3:28:00
Experimental, and you can select whatever you want, right? And it is literally breaking the internet. Let me show you some examples. Right? So, a lot
3:28:06
of people are saying this is literally the best model for code. So, it's extremely powerful. 1 million token
3:28:12
context doesn't just agree with you. Flash is a genius, etc. Great tweet from McKay Wriggsley. You can also see some
3:28:18
of the other stuff people are building. So, like this dinosaur game, I actually build that as well. And I'll show you exactly how to do it in a sec. And you
3:28:23
know, people even building like crazy plane flight simulators like you can see
3:28:29
right here. And it's not just limited to coding. It can do so much more. But that just gives you an idea of how powerful
3:28:34
this is. And wow, my video just popped up right there as well. That's what we like. Julian Goldie rep in here. All
3:28:40
right. So, let me show you some other cool stuff. So, for example, Punam Sony, she did this awesome tweet on like the
3:28:46
comparisons. So, you got Gemini 2.5 Pro over here versus GPT01 Pro. Like, which
3:28:51
one is doing a better job? For sure, if you look at the realism here, I'm going to go with Gemini 2.5 Pro, right? Like
3:28:58
the physics and everything else look 10 times nicer versus GP01 Pro, right? And
3:29:04
that's the difference here. It's like one of them's just better at coding, one of them creates better options, right? this car game we actually just created
3:29:11
and I'm going to run you through like some of the best prompts and how you can build this stuff out right now. Okay. So, let me show you some examples of
3:29:17
what we built. So, if you want to build the 3D car simulator, what you're going to do, simple stuff. You just say, can
3:29:24
you create a simple 3D car simulator with 3.js and single HTML? Add clouds,
3:29:30
mountains, roads, some trees, and a train going around. Right? Make sure it works on mobile. It's going to use its thinking mode. Like you see right here,
3:29:36
we have 2.5 Pro experimental figured out. And then once you've done that, you're going to see all of this right
3:29:43
here. Okay. Now, this is actually coded in HTML. So, all you're going to do is I mean there's two options here. You can
3:29:49
download it and then you can actually grab that code, drag it in here, and start using it like so. Or the other
3:29:57
option is you can go over to something like LiveWeave, as you can see right here, and start using it that way. And
3:30:03
if it ever breaks or anything like that, just refresh the page and you're ready to go on that. Okay, pretty amazing
3:30:10
stuff. Now, it's probably not going to be like perfect first time around, but you get the point. Like, it's incredibly
3:30:15
easy to do. It looks pretty cool. Graphics are super nice, and it did it in one shot as well, right? Like,
3:30:22
there's no there's no messing around here. Like, it just it literally did it. Let's see if we can crash into that. All
3:30:27
right, there we go. And then if you want to keep building out the rest of the game, you can just
3:30:33
go back inside a studio.google.com and start doing this magic. All right, so that's how to build prompt one. I'll
3:30:40
include all the prompts inside the AI profit boardroom if you want to get that link inside the description if you want to use this stuff. But yeah, incredibly
3:30:47
easy, very very fast. So let me show you how easy and fast it is actually to generate this. So if we take that exact same prompt and we'll start a new chat
3:30:53
now. So we'll create prompt. Then we're going to click on this and we shall say okay, same thing, right? I like to press
3:30:59
command and return just to send that quickly over. You've got a timer here. So, it shows you how long it takes to
3:31:04
respond, right? So, if you actually open up the thinking, it's thinking out the whole
3:31:10
process, etc. Looking at how long it takes, and you can see it's using this magic right there. So, it's going to
3:31:16
plan out and reason this. This is not a base model. So, for example, something like DeepSync version 3, the new version, that is a base model, which
3:31:23
means it's not designed for reasoning, right? Whereas if you use for example something like this, this is a reason
3:31:29
model which means it's much better for coding, much better for maths etc. Right? And you can see how quick it's
3:31:34
generating that code. Like it's incredibly fast. So it blasts it out. I mean
3:31:40
it's going to be quite a lot of code but it pretty much codes it perfectly. And the good thing about this is you don't
3:31:46
even need to be able to code or understand this stuff. All you need to be able to do is just download the HTML file and then drag it into a new tab.
3:31:53
Right? Like that's pretty much it. So, it's still coding out right now. Let's see what we're up to. Finished off. All
3:31:58
right. So, that took 66 seconds to generate this game. Now, imagine if someone was coding that out. How long
3:32:04
would this take? Absolutely. To think about it and someone very skilled as well. Right now, what you can do is you
3:32:09
can click the download option here. Got the download ready to go. And then we'll drag it in. And we have the game ready
3:32:18
to load. Right. Pretty simple stuff. So if you want to build other stuff,
3:32:24
here's another example. So this is fully working chess game in HTML. All right.
3:32:29
So we ask it to generate a fully working chess game. Now, if we go back to liveweave.com, we'll delete that and
3:32:36
then we'll plug this in. And we have the chess game. All right, chess game ready to go. So the code is in the top left.
3:32:43
All we need to do is copy and paste HTML, nothing else. And then let's test this works. So can we play? It looks
3:32:50
like we can, right? So, I can't move as a black cuz it's a white's turn. So, let's try that out again now. There we
3:32:56
go. And it gives you the move history as well on the right hand side. Again, this was coded out in one single prompt.
3:33:02
Absolutely wild. So, we just said make a fully working chess game in HTML. It's like here you go. Just go off and use
3:33:07
it, right? No messing around, no back and forth prompting or anything like that. So, if we move the the black pawn
3:33:13
over here, we can decide to move forward or we can move to the left hand side.
3:33:18
And yeah, incredibly easy. We can also move that and it works perfectly, right? How cool is that? How amazing is that?
3:33:26
So, there's all sorts of crazy stuff you can build with this. This is just a start. Let me show you some other stuff. So, you can see here, this was an
3:33:32
awesome tweet from Petri. I don't want to even try and pronounce his surname, but awesome tweet. Make sure you follow
3:33:38
him on Twitter. And you can see he built like this Space Invaders game. All right, so let's try and test the same
3:33:44
prompt out now. And I actually did that earlier. as you can see right here. So,
3:33:49
I copied and pasted the same prompt from Petri like you can see and really simple
3:33:55
and easy. Coded out as HTML again. All right. And then we're going to take
3:34:01
that code, copy that over. We'll go back to LiveWave. All right.
3:34:08
We'll paste that in. Let's see if this works. So, we've got the Space Invader
3:34:14
controls at the bottom. And then you can see here now it's working perfectly. All right. And then I think we want to
3:34:19
collect these health scores. So yeah. Yeah. We just collect the health scores.
3:34:24
And then we're having a a jolly good time here, peeps. All right. I'm live streaming and
3:34:30
coding and building out games. And it's effortless.
3:34:36
And I didn't spend like 20 years learning how to code either. All right. So that's how cool this is, how powerful
3:34:42
it is, etc. And we get little speed boosts as well. and it works perfectly. Now, I honestly
3:34:48
believe the Gemini 2.5 is the most powerful in the world for coding. I I
3:34:56
think it's going to be very hard to beat this, right? Like considering it's free as well and considering you can get an
3:35:02
API and start coding with it. The only thing that would make it better is of course like if you could open source it, but Google never going to do that. Like
3:35:08
that's the secret source, I guess. I don't see Google We ever open sourcing this model, but it's super powerful
3:35:15
stuff. All right. And yeah, you can also, for example, go into
3:35:23
Visual Studio Code. Let me show you how to use this. So, you want to download a visual download Visual Studio Code at
3:35:30
code.visisualstudio.com. Then from there, once you've installed it, go to extensions. And then from
3:35:35
there, I think client is really good. client of Root Code. Pretty good. Root Code is one of my favorites, too. So, if
3:35:41
we select the Root Code icon on the left once you've installed it, then we're going to go to settings and then we're
3:35:46
going to select Google Gemini Pro Experimental. Right? Now, the way to do
3:35:51
this is two different options. You can number one, insert your Google Gemini API key, right? So, you go to a
3:35:58
studio.google.com, click on get API key, and then from here, create API key, and you can grab
3:36:04
an API key right there. Right? completely free to use. So you can grab one like that or you can do is you can
3:36:11
go back to here and you can select open router. Right now if you
3:36:18
select open router inside the API key section here you just go to openrooout.ai. Let me show you how to do
3:36:24
that. There you go. And then once you've done that select keys at the top right
3:36:29
once you've signed in and created an account click create key and you'll be able to use the Gemini model. All right.
3:36:35
So if we go back with our API key, we would plug it in here. Select Google
3:36:40
Gemini. And you see how it says colon free here. That means it's free. Free to
3:36:46
use. All right. So once you've done that, we can hit save. We can hit done. This is a multimodal model as well. So
3:36:52
for example, that means that if we have something in mind that we want to create, then we can easily do it. So for
3:36:58
example, let's go back to live. If we go back to live reef here with the HTML from the
3:37:05
Space Invaders game. All right, we could take that, grab that image, copy it
3:37:11
here, go back into Visual Studio Code, paste in that image that we just created, and say, "Okay, clone this game
3:37:20
and recreate it in a simple HTML file."
3:37:26
Right? Now, the benefit of this is that when you're doing this, and again, you
3:37:31
see how there's some errors with the API key. So, if there's some errors like that, you can just go back here, select
3:37:37
Google, and then select Google Gemini. But you can see it's going off and doing its magic, right? So, the way that you
3:37:42
can do this, and we'll hit we'll allow that. We'll hit save. There is that when
3:37:48
you're doing this, like you can save it locally. That means that if when you reopen Visual Studio Code, you've got
3:37:53
the code ready to save locally. So that's the benefit of using this instead of like Google AI studio which is going
3:37:59
to save everything on your account but you don't have it like to re-edit later and that sort of thing be a lot harder to find that. So that's basically how to
3:38:06
build and create anything that you want. You know the new update from Gemini 2.5 Pro from what I've seen for coding
3:38:13
specifically is better than any other AI model out there and it doesn't cost you a penny. But yeah, it's an absolute
3:38:19
gamecher. So if you want all the prompts from today and the examples etc. I'll include that inside the AI profit
3:38:26
boardroom link in the comments and description. Prices going up this month. This is a community all focused on
3:38:31
saving time and making more money with AI. So, if you want to learn how to do that, feel free to get this stuff. And
3:38:37
inside the SAP section here, we've got tons of training courses on, for example, like how to build anything with
3:38:43
Gemini 2.5 Pro, including how to set up like AR Studio and how to use and build anything with Gemini 2.5 Pro in 9 or 10
3:38:51
different ways, like you can see. And also we've got a full course on like Deepseek 3.1, NA10, MCP agents, whatever
3:39:00
you want to learn pretty much when it comes to AI is all inside here. So feel free to get that link in the comments description and inside the community you
3:39:06
can ask 578 members, anything that you want about AI. So if you get strugg if
3:39:12
you're struggling about something or you need a bit of support, etc. And feel free to post inside the classroom and we can help you out. Like you can see right
3:39:18
here, everyone gets an answer, right? So if you have a question, post inside the community and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. And everyone's here to
3:39:25
just help each other out. Like you can see. So for example, Constantine was asking a question and six people
3:39:30
actually just came back and answered. Yeah. And also there are live Q&A calls here. So you can jump on the weekly live
3:39:35
Q&A calls, ask any questions you have and we're happy to help you. Top of that, if you want to get a free onetoone

3:40:05
from your website, feel free to get that free SEO strategy session link in the comments description. Appreciate you
3:40:11
watching and thanks. Bye-bye. I'm going to show you how to build MCP
3:40:18
servers using Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, the benefit of using Gemini AR Studio is
3:40:24
that you can actually build MCP servers or you can code whatever you want. For example, apps, games, tools, etc. Using
3:40:31
Gemini 2.5 Pro, which is the latest update, super powerful. It seems to be on the same level as Claw 3.7 Sonet, but
3:40:38
it's free. And if you want to use this, then the way that I would recommend setting this up if you want to set up
3:40:43
like MCP servers and automate whatever you can. Then you can download Visual Studio Code. So we're going to do that
3:40:49
in a sec. And then we're going to get an API key from AI studio.google.com. Right? So you just click get API key,
3:40:56
create API key, and then from here we can grab an API key that we can plug directly into Visual Studio Code. Right?
3:41:03
And there's two ways to set this up, right? For example, you can use R code and that enables MCP server creation.
3:41:10
So, for example, you can see I've got Plexi set up and ready to go right here. The other option and I think this may be
3:41:17
even easier is if you go to client, client have made
3:41:22
this ridiculously easy, right? So, if you go to client, which is an extension inside Visual Studio Code, again, Visual
3:41:29
Studio Code is free, client is free, and the API key from Gemini 2.5 Pro is free
3:41:34
as well. You can go in here and then you can install client and go to MCP
3:41:40
servers. All right. So, I'll show you how to set up client. You just type in client in the extensions tab over here.
3:41:47
Wait for that to load. Then you can download it. Once you've downloaded it, then you can go over to client on the
3:41:53
icon over here. Click that and then click settings. All right. Settings over here. Once you've done that, then you
3:42:00
can navigate to the MCP icon over here. and they've literally got a marketplace
3:42:05
where you can set all of this stuff up. Now, let me show you how much easier that is than using Cursor. So, if we go
3:42:11
over to Cursor over here, this is a lot more like hard work. So, if you want to set up MCP servers inside Cursor, you go
3:42:19
to your settings and then you go to MCP and then you add a new global MCP server. You have to create the file for
3:42:24
the MCPS and then insert the information right there. It's a lot more technical. It's much harder to do. Whereas if you
3:42:30
want to set this up with Google and Gemini 2.5 Pro, you can do that here. Now you might be wondering, okay, why
3:42:36
would you use an MCP server? What what's the benefit of this? This is basically the future of AI agents, right? So
3:42:42
previously, if you were building an AI agent, it was either not connected to the internet, right? Or if you wanted to
3:42:48
connect it to the internet, so for example, something like Plexi, you're only going to get one feature, right?
3:42:54
And then you have to set up different tools, different apps, etc. It's a bit of a nightmare. You can use something like for example NA10 to do all this.
3:43:00
But again, it's a lot of work. You have to set up this and this, right? And these are all going to be different features of the same tool. So for
3:43:06
example, you might have one for sending emails, drafting emails,
3:43:12
opening emails, and another one for writing emails, right? It's a lot of work. Whereas, for
3:43:19
example, with MCP servers, you basically, for example, you can have an AI agent that's linked
3:43:26
to a Gmail MCP and then from there it gets all the functionality directly. You don't have
3:43:33
to set up individually. So, it's a lot more efficient and that's basically the future of MCP servers, right? You can
3:43:38
pull in loads of good data. So, we're going to go over here and for example, if we want to set up Plexi, we can just
3:43:44
type in Plexi Research over here. We can click install. And what you can see is this is going to
3:43:50
use an API request to set this up. Now the API that I have set up right here is open router, but I also have Gemini set
3:43:56
up as well. But either way, you can use Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. If you want to get an open router API key, I'll show
3:44:02
you that in a sec. So what you would do is you would go over to Openroo.ai.
3:44:08
Then in the top left here, you can go to keys and from the key section, you can just create a key and set that up inside
3:44:16
the settings of client. Right. So, we're going to retry this. Let's see if it works. If it doesn't, we'll grab a Okay.
3:44:24
All right. So, what we can do, like you can see right here, it's a little bit temperamental on open router, but we can
3:44:30
grab an API key from Google. Let me do that. We'll copy this one.
3:44:35
I'll delete that in a sec as well. Go out to Visual Studio Code. We'll plug in the API key. We'll select Gemini 2.5
3:44:43
Pro Experimental. We've got some custom instructions here as well. They're inside the AI profit board. If you want to get the custom instructions from me,
3:44:49
we're going to retry that request right now. And let's see how we get on, peeps. All
3:44:55
right. This should be pretty simple and easy to do. The thing that it's going to ask me for in a sec is an API key from
3:45:01
Plexi. All right. So, if you want to set that up, you can go to your settings
3:45:07
inside here. And then from here, you're going to go to API. And then from here, you would scroll
3:45:13
down and go to API keys. Generate that bad boy. Copy it. Go over to Visual
3:45:19
Studio Code. You can see it's now said, please provide your API key. Happy to do that, mate. There you go.
3:45:26
And the other powerful thing about this is like you can give Visual Studio Code or client or whatever you want a
3:45:33
connection to the outside world, right? Which means, for example, it's connected to Plexi and it can talk to their server
3:45:39
and it can ask different queries and that sort of thing, right? So, we're going to wait for that to load right here. If you want to see what's set up,
3:45:45
we'll come on to that in a second. Actually, I'll just wait for this set up. I don't want to mess around here, mess anything up. So, we're going to
3:45:51
approve that. Bear in mind, like sometimes it doesn't work. So you can see here, for example, it didn't work perfectly. We're going to have to go
3:45:57
back and forth and be a little bit patient with it. Bear in mind, MCP servers are relatively new, right? This is a relatively new feature that just
3:46:04
came out a few months ago. And now, for example, cursor Claude were the first ones who
3:46:09
originated with it. Rue code, you can set it up in cursor as well. And then also, you've got chat GBT that are
3:46:17
planning to launch it directly inside the desktop app. So, wait for that to load right here. see what happens next.
3:46:24
So that is running it magic right here. So okay, it exists in the build directory blah blah blah. Just going to wait for that to load. We'll just hit
3:46:30
proceed while it's running. Going to X off that. You can see it's setting something up here as well inside
3:46:36
the terminal and then it's going to test it out. Right now we can actually click auto
3:46:42
approve and then every time we want to use this MTP from Plexi, it will approve. Again, wouldn't expect this to
3:46:47
work perfectly first time round. So you can see it's got another error. I knew that was going to happen before I clicked on it just because of how
3:46:54
temperamental this can be. But wait for this to load. And you can see how it's editing the client MCP servers here.
3:47:00
Right. So it's got the code for the MCP section
3:47:06
inside this document. Now in the meantime, whilst that's setting up, we'll just approve that. Whilst that's
3:47:12
setting up, let me show you what you can do with this. So if we go to Plexi, for example, you can see all the features.
3:47:18
So if you actually want to see okay what can I do with each MCP you can just go to the MCP of that
3:47:24
particular place right usually hosted on GitHub. So for example MCC MCP server setup you
3:47:31
can see what you can do with it. So you can for example search get documentation find API keys check deprecated code etc.
3:47:40
And if you have any problems you just check that. The other cool thing as well if we type in MCP GitHub
3:47:48
claude we can see all the MCP servers that are available right so these are all the
3:47:55
servers that we have so for example like Google Drive Google Maps you can connect this to Slack as well we're just going
3:48:03
to press Ctrl C on that this is not working at all right let's keep going now going
3:48:12
open up a new window here. Let's see if it works better with
3:48:17
it. Keeps hitting the limit there. That is no bueno. All right, let's try open
3:48:23
router. There we go. Going to just delete the old MCP server that we have
3:48:29
and we'll try installing Plexi Research from Ruko directly from client. Sorry.
3:48:35
There we go. All right, it's working. All right, so here's what I had to do.
3:48:41
if you've already installed this. I think this is because I do so many installs of it for YouTube tutorials.
3:48:47
But that was messy. That was very messy. All right. If you want the clean way to set up, basically go to R code, open up
3:48:55
a new folder, right? So, if you were inside a previous folder with the
3:49:01
instructions, then just make sure you open up a new one like I did right here. Then you're going to say set up the MCP
3:49:07
server blah blah blah. You can see here we've got 2.5 proximal setup. So that's free to use. There's no charge on the
3:49:13
API key. And then basically from the marketplace if for
3:49:18
example you want to install Plexi just click on Plexi Research, hit install and
3:49:24
then say okay I can help set up the MCP server. Here you go. Did the MCP requests gave it the API key
3:49:32
like you can see right here. And it's like thanks here you go. Test it out. it were first time, right? So, this
3:49:41
if you've got a previous install of this or you've set it up before and then deleted the API key, etc. I would recommend just setting up a whole new
3:49:46
folder and just getting started again cuz that was very messy. All right, but the easy way is as I've shown you, just
3:49:53
set up a new folder, use Gemini Pro Experimental, and that was using the
3:49:58
Google Gemini directly. Okay, took like minimal back and forth. So, let's test it out. Now, we're going to say, okay,
3:50:04
what happened in AI news today? And you see the query here. So this is what it's going to ask to search query on Plexi.
3:50:12
And then it's got it magic right there. It seems to be using the think mode as well inside perlexi. So you can see it's
3:50:18
okay. Let's fill this out. Blah blah blah. Here's how we're going to do it. I wonder API key using. But then you got
3:50:24
the nicely formatted section right here. Right. So it says, okay, I use PLC's MCP
3:50:29
servers search tool to find the latest AI newses requested. This is from today,
3:50:34
so March the 30th. And then you got Apple strategy and Samsung right here.
3:50:40
But yeah, like I said, learn from my mistakes. All right, so don't do the complicated way. Do the easiest way,
3:50:45
which is with Klein. Open up a new folder. So you just go to file, open folder over here, set up a
3:50:52
new one if you've got a previous install and then from here go to Plexi, install
3:50:58
it, grab your API key, and that is so simple and easy once you set up the new
3:51:03
version. So also it's got some interesting stuff here. So we've got, for example, like browser use, AIdriven browser use automation.
3:51:10
That's quite interesting. Let's see what this is. Browser use MCP server AIdriven blah blah blah.
3:51:18
And then you can install it on claw desktop as well. Quite interesting
3:51:23
local. And then you can see the API keys here you can use. So you can actually use
3:51:29
Gemini and Google API key for that. Let's test this out. I wonder if we can get it working. So we're going to go to
3:51:36
install browser use. It's probably going to ask me for a Gemini API key. We'll
3:51:41
test that in a sec. Hopefully it doesn't break anything as well locally. Looks interesting though cuz the way that I
3:51:49
know to use browser use with client directly is you have to get a clawed API
3:51:55
key, right? Which is not cheap for most people watching this. Like it can cost a bit of money, but it's setting that up.
3:52:00
So, let's see what we get back here. MCP servers updated. Updating MCP servers.
3:52:06
So, it seems to be working. And then what we need to do is just grab an API key. It's hit the limit as well.
3:52:15
So, go back here. Grab an API key. Copy that.
3:52:20
Have to delete all my API keys again in a sec. All right. So, that's good to go. Let's approve that. So, it's trying to
3:52:27
open it up, but it can't. Let's see what we need to do here. We might need to
3:52:32
give it a new API key directly in the chat here. For now, what I'm going to do just to make this simple, I'm going to
3:52:37
switch to anthropic. Use the API key from Claude. Retry that.
3:52:43
And then for the actual browser use, I'll use Gemini. So you can see it's progress here. If we open that up. So
3:52:50
we'll start a new task now because it seems to hit the context limit. Yeah, that is wouldn't recommend using the
3:52:57
browser use MCP does not work. But Blexis does though. You see that's
3:53:03
working beautifully right there. All right, let's try some others. So you also got for example send grid which you
3:53:08
could probably send emails with. What else we got? Fire cruel advanced web
3:53:14
scraping and crawling wolf ram alpha
3:53:19
air table could be quite useful. Ser search as well. I think that'll be really good. So you can basically use
3:53:25
this with Googlelexi. The good thing about flexi is like you get the AI results not just a Google search which
3:53:31
is pretty good as well. But yeah, you can see how to set them up. So simplest and easiest way seems to be you open up
3:53:37
a new folder then you install it from marketplace. Bear in mind like not all of these seem to work. So for example,
3:53:42
browser use that says installed but it totally let us down right there, right?
3:53:48
Whereas the Plexi one much better much better. You also got for example like Google
3:53:54
Calendar, Discord, Spotify as well which is pretty useful. I wonder if that requires a API key. Let's have a look
3:54:01
here. So you can read more about these if you want. So, for example, if you want the Spotify API credentials to link
3:54:08
MCP servers to client, then you would just go to the developer dashboard and start getting that set up, right? Like
3:54:14
you can see right here. And then installation looks fairly simple, but you never know.
3:54:20
All right, but the most reliable one that I've seen so far is Plexi. And then also Brave Search, I've tested. That's
3:54:27
pretty good. Airbnb I've tested inside NA10. I've got other video tutorials on that. But that's how you can set up MCP
3:54:33
servers. And then you can see here you get the results back and and you can
3:54:38
set all this up with Gemini 2.5 like I was showing you. Now if you want to get
3:54:44
my community that shows you how to make money and save time with AI, feel free to get that link in the comments description comes with lots of tutorials
3:54:52
on MCP agents. Right? So if you scroll to the left here, you'll see our workflows and tutorial on MCP agents
3:54:58
right there. And also NA10 MCP agents, which is a lot more complicated than just using the straightforward client
3:55:05
method where you can install directly. You can also go in the calendar and jump on the Q&A, ask any questions you have.
3:55:11
And also inside the community here, if you get stuck in between different Q&A calls, you can post inside the
3:55:16
community, ask any questions you have, and we are happy to help you. All right. And if you want to get a free one-to-one
3:55:22
SEO strategy session that shows you how you can make more money and save time and get more customers with SEO, feel
3:55:28
free to get that. We'll show you how we take websites from zero to 145,000 business month and generate hundreds of
3:55:34
thousands of dollars in sales and optimizers. Feel free to get that link in the comments description
3:55:39
and thanks so much for watching. Today we are going to be talking about the
3:55:44
latest update from Rode and how to use it for free with now this is a
3:55:50
completely different way of programming AI agents between coding architecting
3:55:55
debugging it also help you save credits and I'm going to show you exactly how to do all of this for free step by step so
3:56:01
you can build apps tools games websites etc using this new feature now I've never seen anything like this come out
3:56:07
from any other sort of coding program for example like Wind surf and other tools like that. Don't think you can do
3:56:13
this. Now, this is a brand new feature and essentially what it does is it's
3:56:18
going to down any sort of task whether that's building or coding an app, a tool, a website, etc. throughout the the
3:56:26
the sort of process. It's going to break it down into separate tasks. All right. So, let me show you an example. We got
3:56:32
the legend himself, Vic, on the call today. Welcome, Vic. Welcome. Welcome to me as well. It's
3:56:37
great to be here, Julian. Super excited. You know, this is something super valuable for the people in the AI profit
3:56:44
boardroom. They've been asking stuff about R code. So, I think this is going to be an awesome addition. You know,
3:56:49
segmenting tasks and all that. Super fun. Yeah, it's it's a game changer. It's it's basically like you have a swarm of
3:56:55
army, you know, like an army of AI agents that just go off and like tackle really complex stuff and break it down
3:57:01
into like little multi-step projects. So, it's going to be a game changer. And I know a lot of people in AI profit bordering were asking about this, too.
3:57:07
So let's get through it and I'll show you exactly first of all how it works and then I'll show you how to set up. All right. So for example, if we go
3:57:15
inside Visual Studio Code and then we go to Rode, which you can see on the left hand side over here. And by the way, if
3:57:21
you don't know how to use Visual Studio Code, you just go to code.visisualstudio.com
3:57:26
and then from there you're going to go over to extensions, select Root Code. All of this is free, right? But it's a
3:57:32
super powerful coder. I know you've tested, for example, Vic, some like browser extensions like it can go off
3:57:38
and use your laptop and that sort of thing, right? Absolutely. You can even book a flight for myself, you know, to the Maldes or
3:57:44
something. So sometimes I'm scared it go it puts me on a vacation that I'm not looking forward to, but you know, it's
3:57:49
pretty good. I'm kidding. It's awesome. I see that you could end up in Zimbabwe or anywhere, right? Absolutely. Absolutely.
3:57:55
All right, cool. So you can see an example here. So basically what we said inside this task is like create a sleek
3:58:01
conversion focused landing page for Goldie agency's AI automation dashboard. The design should be modern fast loading
3:58:07
and highlight the benefits of AI powered business automation. Right? So it's it's a pretty complex sort of strategy right
3:58:13
there. Um essentially what you can see here is it's going to flick for you right you don't have to think about
3:58:18
whether you want to use code or architect or ask or debug which I think nobody can be bothered to switch between
3:58:24
anyway. and it will give you a full task like this and be like, "Right, first we're gonna do this, right? Then we're
3:58:30
gonna do that." And it just breaks it down really nicely into it. So, it's pretty powerful. And then what it's
3:58:35
going to do is it's going to create like separate subtasks, right? So, you can see here how we gave it the prompt and
3:58:41
then 2 minutes later it's like, "Right, I'm going to launch the landing page for you here." Um, so it's is pretty cool
3:58:46
because it's like it's creating a shorter context window and breaking down each of the tasks into subtasks. So, I
3:58:52
kind of show you an example of what you'd normally do. Like, normally you're going to brute f brute force a task and
3:58:59
you all in the same context window and sometimes you can use like thousands of tokens, right? Um, and it gets quite
3:59:06
expensive and that sort of thing. Whereas, for example, with this, you give it a task as a prompt, then it's
3:59:12
going to break it down into loads of little subtasks that and the agent
3:59:17
carefully figures out, okay, which subtasks for this one, that one, etc. And eventually between all those you get
3:59:24
your output, right? So you just save tokens and you you take a really complex
3:59:29
project and break it down into little tasks. And this is just with one single prompt if that makes sense.
3:59:34
So you're basically saving a bunch of money as well, right? By saving those tokens. Yeah, 100%. Or if you're on the free API
3:59:41
key, so if you're using Gemini, which is free to program with and code with, but runs out of credits very quickly, this
3:59:48
is like a more efficient way of using it, if that makes sense. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So, let me show you how to do
3:59:54
this. Basically, what you do is like, okay, let's let's say for example, we want to create a website, right? We can say, okay, create a website for my SEO
4:00:01
agency inside here. And we're using Boomerang Rotes here, right? So, if we hit enter like so, and what I'm going to
4:00:09
do is just make sure I've updated my API key. So, I think I deleted one on the live stream the other day. So, I'm just going to go to But this is really good
4:00:15
for anyone to see, but I'm going to go to a studio.com. You can get a free API key from Google using the latest
4:00:22
knowledge and that sort of thing. Copy that over. Plug it over to Visual Studio Code. Plug it in settings over here. Hit
4:00:28
save. Hit done. Boom. All right. And then it's going to attempt that in like 14 seconds. So I'm just going to redo
4:00:33
that. We'll hit resume task. And there we go. Boom. All right. So it
4:00:39
starts using that. We're just going to hit allow over here. And then we can start using that process. All right. So
4:00:46
I'm going to like it really didn't actually break that down into like look on the settings over here and then we'll say create big website for my HD with
4:00:54
all my etc. Hopefully that should start using the boomerang mode. I'll show you
4:01:00
how to set up the boomerang mode in a minute. Vic, if you get if you see any comments on the live stream etc. Do you
4:01:05
want to just read them out as we go? So we make sure we answer everyone's questions. Absolutely Julian. I'm paying close attention to it so don't worry.
4:01:12
Beautiful. All right. So here's an example. Right. So we we gave it the prompt. Let me X off this. So we gave it
4:01:19
the prompt like give create a big website for SEO agency with all my services etc. And you see here how it's
4:01:24
like okay creating this is a significant project. So let's break this down. Um
4:01:29
and it switches into ass mode. And then what it's going to do is it's going to use that boomerang feature to turn
4:01:35
everything into like little subtasks. So you see it's like right it's kind of like a consultative approach where it's
4:01:41
like right how should we define the requirements for your SU agency? Do you want to gather some information, a list
4:01:46
of pages? Do you want to start with basic structure and ask details later or just cancel the task? So, go ahead.
4:01:53
We we do have a question from Rod Julian, which isn't really tied into a root code, but the man asked, "When do
4:01:58
you sleep?" And I think that's a genuine question that I'm also interested in. You know, I actually slept at 8:00 p.m. last
4:02:04
night, and I woke up at at 6:00 a.m. I was exhausted. But usually, yeah,
4:02:10
usually I sleep like 8 hours a day. So, I I sleep super early. I don't drink or smoke or do anything else which just
4:02:16
allows me to like sleep super early and get stuff done, you know. So, basically, you are a machine, right? You
4:02:22
That's it. I'm literally I'm a machine. I I wanted to be modest. I wanted to be humble. But, uh so yeah. No, that's it.
4:02:29
Prioritize sleep, people. You got to stay healthy, you know. So, I agree. Sorry. And AI should allow you more time to
4:02:34
sleep. We should do a sleep course inside the AI profit board. We should. We should. That would be good. All right. Cool. So, we're going to kick
4:02:39
it off now. And I'm going to say all right so we can for example provide like a list of pages and services or we can
4:02:45
start with a basic structure. So just to keep things simple I'm going to start with a basic structure and then add the details later because this you know it's
4:02:51
for a YouTube video. So you see how it's switching now into code mode and it's created a new task. Just created a new
4:02:58
task out of nowhere you know. So that's a new task. Like you see our prompt has disappeared completely. So if we go back
4:03:03
to this like it's already created like one task right there and we already gave it a prompt. So we've got two different
4:03:08
tasks going on. So if we go back to Visual Studio Code over here and then we open up a new window just so you can see
4:03:15
what this looks like. We'll go back to R code. What it would do is create everything inside one long prompt. But
4:03:20
here is like task one, task two, etc. And we use less tokens doing that which is pretty nice. So if we go back here,
4:03:26
and by the way, we're doing all this for free. So we're building out like full websites for free, which is pretty nice. And you can also combine this with MCP
4:03:32
agents, which we've got a full tutorial inside the AR profit boardroom. That's essentially how this goes. It's awesome that you mentioned NPC agents. We
4:03:39
actually do have a question from Amazon Andy. He said, well, it's like a three-part, so I'm just going to read
4:03:44
them all out for you. The first thing is, how does this compare against Manis, Julia? Yeah. So, I mean, for me, the only
4:03:52
Okay, so I mean, number one, this is free, right? Whereas, for example, with Manis, you're paying $200 a month,
4:03:58
right? Number two, it's becoming more like Manis because with Manis, what it would do is like create loads of little
4:04:04
subtasks inside one chat. And that's essentially what this is doing, right? Whereas previously what Manis would what
4:04:10
you would do with client is like have one really long chat, which didn't really make sense. So, let me log into
4:04:16
Manis. I'll show you what I mean. We're just going to log in here and sign in if I can. I might not be able to get in here. Let me try and sign in. We'll try
4:04:22
and sign in with that one. They might have kicked me out. Imagine. No way. It could happen. Could happen. It could
4:04:28
be possible. Seems like I can't log in, but we'll we'll come back to that later. So, if we go back to Visual Studio Code
4:04:34
essentially. Yes. So, there's no you don't need to pay for this because you're using the free Visual Studio
4:04:39
Code. The extension is free. Root code is free and also Gemini is free too, right? So, that's a big difference. And
4:04:45
then I would say the main benefit of of Manis is like it can deploy full-blown apps uh a subdomain if that makes sense.
4:04:52
So like you can say to manus okay create a a website from SEO agency and then deploy
4:05:00
it right and it will deploy it on a a manus.space subdomain which means that you know you get that that response back
4:05:07
whereas root code you can't do that you can't deploy to a subspace a subdomain. Yeah. And then additionally a lot of the
4:05:15
other thing is as well like inside ruode you can actually set up a debugging version of chrome and then chrome can be
4:05:23
used with root code. So you can get claw 3.7 sonet to start using your your browser if that makes sense.
4:05:29
Absolutely it does. Yeah. Whereas for example with manis it's like a separate terminal. It's kind
4:05:36
of like a a completely separate environment which means that it's very hard for you to log into things because
4:05:43
you have to give Manis all your login details or take control etc. you know. Yeah. A lot of credentials.
4:05:48
Yeah. Yeah. That's it. So and and the other thing as well like you need a Manis invite right to be able to use Manis you need invite like it's it's
4:05:55
exclusive. So not everyone has access whereas you can download root code today and then in your settings here if you go
4:06:01
down to the browser use section here you can get it to take control of your
4:06:07
laptop. So you can set up a local IP run Chrome debugging and it if you're listening to this you never used that
4:06:13
before like it's going to sound super technical. So just check out the tutorial inside the AI profit bordering but essentially that's how you do it you
4:06:19
know. Absolutely awesome. So you can see here now what it's doing is like it's like
4:06:25
what should we work on next and so you can say okay improve the overall visual
4:06:30
design add more details refine the content add a new page etc. It just breaks everything down step by step for
4:06:36
you creates like a really customized workflow. The other thing is as well like previously I'll try and find an
4:06:42
example but previously what would happen inside client is like it would get stuck in a loop because it was it was running
4:06:48
off a big context whereas this is creating separate tasks. Well, for example, it's creating a let me let me
4:06:55
view some previous ones where it's broken before. H I think it'll be hard for me to find. But essentially what happens quite often inside recode is
4:07:01
like it can get stuck in a loop because it's focusing on the same contact. Whereas with this like it just goes off
4:07:08
and does its magic in separate subtasks. So it's less likely to break and less likely to go into an error loop. So it's
4:07:13
pretty cool update. And then also what you can do is like set up MCPs inside here and then you can have your AI for
4:07:20
example do one subtask where it searches perplexity or one subtask where it searches um Netlefi and stuff like that
4:07:27
you know. Yeah. So it's pretty cool. And then the the other things I mean the other things
4:07:32
that you can do inside root code as well is like you can actually set up claude
4:07:38
as the API to start using your browser or previewing the website inside the the
4:07:44
root code as well. So there's there's a lot of stuff going on here. You can see it's hit the limit. So if you ever hit
4:07:49
the limit inside Google Gemini, what you can do is you can switch between models here. So you could say, okay, just use
4:07:54
flash instead now. So we've hit the limit on on Google Gemini. And you can see it continues now. Or the other thing
4:08:00
you can do is you can go to your settings and switch between open router and open router will give you more
4:08:05
credits there as well. So if you hit the credit limit, you can do that. So I'll set you I'll show you how to set up Boomerang. Okay.
4:08:10
Yeah. Before we jump to Boomerang real quick, uh I saw a couple of questions actually because you did mention MCPs
4:08:16
and people are you know all about the buzz. Do you have like a favorite uh MCP
4:08:21
use case or which MCP you think is the most like let's say the best one or even top three if you have you know we even
4:08:27
just had a donation asking for specifically favorite MCP so thanks so
4:08:33
much for the donation absolute legend thank you yeah so I mean my favorite personally perplexi is
4:08:40
really really good simply because with perplexity you know you've got you got Google Gemini you got Claude but they
4:08:46
don't even know what's going on today right and the data is outdated, right? The biggest limitation of any AI,
4:08:52
especially if for example, you know, you want to create content around what's happened today or you want to create a new website around what's happened
4:08:58
recently. You know, information gets outdated really quickly. So just linking this to perplexity allows the AI agent
4:09:05
to not just build a website, but also to Google, you know, what's happening in real time, what's happening today. It
4:09:10
can go off and do deep research reports as well, if that makes sense. Absolutely. Yeah. Let me show you some of my
4:09:16
favorite. We'll we'll go into client here and we'll open this up. So I'm just going to close Visual Studio Code and
4:09:22
then we'll reopen this up. Right. So if we go inside client here, I'll show you
4:09:27
some of my favorite MCPS. So client is probably the easiest and best way to set up MCPS, but you can see all the stuff
4:09:34
that you can set up here. So I would say Plexi is my favorite. Just type in
4:09:39
Perplexi and you can install that pretty easily right there. Um, what I also
4:09:44
really like is Brave Search. Again, for the same reason that I do a lot of SEO. You know, we do a lot of SEO for our
4:09:50
agency as well. So, this is great for just doing SEO. And, you know, you can even create like a content outline tool
4:09:55
or content creation tool that searches the web, uses Brave Searches API, which
4:10:01
is free, and then uses that to like reverse engineer what's ranking, what content people have used, and then how
4:10:07
can we make a better way or a better piece of content based on that, you know? And the other thing as well like you
4:10:12
know between brave search and also between perplexity like if you go
4:10:18
directly into claude and you're not in the US then you can't use the web search
4:10:24
feature right and so claude is very very limited if you're like okay write some about wind surf 6 for example right
4:10:31
windsurf 6 just came out it doesn't know what it doesn't even know what windsurf 6 is right it thinks that it's about
4:10:37
water sports right whereas for example If you if you can connect it to perplexity
4:10:42
and we go into perplexity and we say okay write about wind surf 6 because perplexity is connected to the internet
4:10:48
it can actually understand okay wind surf 6 is about AI here's the latest AI updates and this is what it's about so
4:10:55
you just get much more accurate data that's less likely to be hallucinated and you make your AI agents way more powerful inside uh root code or client
4:11:02
yeah I think Shopify if you're running the e-commerce store Shopify is by far the MC MCP you can set up because you
4:11:08
can integrate your products with whatever you build inside client and the final one that I would say is uh yeah so
4:11:15
we we've talked about perplexity brave search is really good for e-commerce
4:11:20
owners and then I would say air table as well air data and that sort of thing you know yeah yeah cool yeah so it depends what
4:11:28
you want but it's super easy to install and set up and that sort of thing and then you can connect the power of root code and it's Boomerat tasks with MCPS
4:11:37
awesome awesome awesome All right, cool. Yeah. So, if you want to set this up, super simple.
4:11:42
So, what you're going to do is you are going to go, let me show you here. We're going to go back to the guide. All
4:11:49
right. And essentially, you can download this JSON file and insert that into R
4:11:56
code. So, I set it up this morning. It was super simple and easy
4:12:03
that way. Just trying to find exactly where it is. So yeah, inside you just
4:12:08
click on root code here. Then you're going to click on the bottom left, hit edit, and then inside here, you can
4:12:14
insert the custom rolls, right? So you see how we've got boomerang selected. You put the roll definition, you grab
4:12:20
that from the boomerang guide here. So you copy this and then you go back into
4:12:26
R code, plug that in, and then inside the model, inside the mode specific
4:12:31
custom instructions, you're then going to grab this. So the custom instructions
4:12:37
from here, plug that in and then paste that in like so. Then hit done. And you
4:12:44
can switch between boomerang and all the other features here. Right? If you just have boomerang set up uh by default,
4:12:49
then it will switch between code architect ask and debug by its own. Right? So you can figure out everything
4:12:55
by it own. There is a question Julian. What do you think would be the best use case for
4:13:01
let's say boomerang? like do you have any off of the top of your dome that you think oh this is a game changer specifically for this? Yeah, I think
4:13:08
anything where it's really complex and you've got a lot of subtasks, right? So, if you're for example like trying to create a big website, then it's a game
4:13:15
changer for that. Anything that requires a lot of research to build as well, super useful. But basically, if it's
4:13:22
super linear, like if it's just build me a SEO calculator tool and it's just like from point A to point B, you don't need
4:13:28
this. But if for example you're building out a big website with lots of pages, categories, if for example you're
4:13:34
building out a very complex app where you need to break it down into little subcategories, this is what you want to use.
4:13:39
Makes complete sense. Yeah. Let me show you an example, right? So you know you can use something like data button. Data button is a a super
4:13:47
powerful tool for doing stuff like this because it will flick between like architect and and all those sort of things. So let's load this up and I'll
4:13:54
show you what I mean. Like if you were building a job board for example. Mhm. Then you could then you could check
4:14:00
that out. Let me sign out here. Yeah. So just a super super complex project. So I'm just trying to make sure I log into
4:14:06
the right account on data button. One sec.
4:14:11
It looks like all my apps have gone. But essentially, yeah, if you if you're building anything big, then this is this
4:14:17
is perfect, right? So it's just orchestrating like really complex tasks and workflows, if that makes sense.
4:14:22
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, we do have Val donating again asking, "Have you tried prompt by DD
4:14:30
devs?" I think he means like a MCP agent prompt. No, I've not tried that, but I would like to check it out. Maybe we can do
4:14:36
that on another live stream. That would be cool. Um, one t one tip I will give people
4:14:41
today is like if there's one tool you check out today, this one impressed me massively was Lindy. Lindy was really
4:14:49
really cool. essentially on Lindy you you know like we we've set up Zapia tasks together right?
4:14:55
Yep. And you know it's like super complex and you have to plug in all your APIs and all that sort of stuff. Basically inside
4:15:01
here all the APIs are plugged in already and all you need to do is just connect your email address and then you can
4:15:07
automate for example like super complex workflows like this. You just hit click on add add your Google Drive sheets and
4:15:13
stuff like that and it's pretty cool. Like for example, this morning I built this tool and you'll see the video on my
4:15:19
main YouTube channel. This tool right here, it basically automates like customer service. It was super simple
4:15:25
and easy. Um, you can add custom knowledge. So I I added our website to the custom knowledge base here.
4:15:32
Mhm. So you can add websites or text or files, whatever. And then you know you you've created an automated chatbot.
4:15:38
Customize your website in like a few clicks. Super simple and easy. Yeah. Um, so like this morning with Lindy in just
4:15:47
a few clicks, we automated, let me show you inside the AI profit boardroom and we got the templates
4:15:52
inside there. So we automated email drafts and on the website like without any coding and you know like NA10 can be
4:15:59
really confusing to use. This is like a tech this is a much much simpler way of using that. Awesome tool.
4:16:04
Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. So check that out. I've got a a video on the main channel if you want to check that out and learn about it. But yeah, any other questions
4:16:10
before we go? I think that's about it. A lot of people dropped some uh like interesting their
4:16:16
favorite, you know, MCPS such as desktop commander, fetch, web search, etc. But yeah, overall just just yeah, very good
4:16:24
and and awesome tool when it comes to root code and its boomerang feature, you know.
4:16:29
Nice. Nice. Yeah. So, I mean like just to to recap here in case people are not 100% clear on like why would you use
4:16:35
this? Well, number one, it makes like complex tasks basically put into little subtasks, you know, like you would do on Trello or Asa and that sort of thing. So
4:16:42
the AI figures out exactly from your main prompt what needs to be delegated and which tasks need to be broken down.
4:16:48
And then also it will automatically figure out the right mode for that. So whether you need to use for example like architect or code or ask or debug
4:16:56
depending on on what the task is. The final thing is like it just keep it keeps the AI super focused on like that
4:17:02
one subtask instead of doing loads of different ones and it makes the results like way faster and smoother. Awesome.
4:17:08
All right, cool. So, if you want all the templates and all the workflows that that we use at our agency, Vic, I mean,
4:17:13
how many have we set up over the last 30 days? It's insane, right? I'm not going to lie to you. I think we have over like hundreds of lessons by
4:17:19
now and and it's growing exponentially day by day. So, it's pretty awesome. Yeah, it's insane. It's insane. And if
4:17:25
you want to ask questions, jump on the weekly Q&A. Vic, you you did one yesterday and absolutely smashed it, right? Like I I saw all the feedback,
4:17:31
people saying like how good it was and everything. Yeah, we had over 20 people join us yesterday. It was an amazing vibrant
4:17:37
Q&A. We even had to go one minute overtime, which usually, you know, in Q&A it doesn't happen, but it was so so
4:17:42
good. A lot of great questions. People were interested in the most basic of N8N setups, and I showed them like from the
4:17:49
most basic of N8N setup, how you can connect it, what you do with the nodes. It was pretty awesome. So, if you get in
4:17:54
there, every Wednesday we have a Q&A. Feel free to join and I would love to welcome you.
4:18:00
Awesome. And then if you get stuck in between the Q&A, just post in the community. You can see here, for example, Vic, you're always posting new
4:18:06
updates. It's insane how many updates you post. And then like I mean this, for example, Denise just posted like two
4:18:11
days ago. You can see all the answers and the help they got. Like it's just a community full of great people helping
4:18:16
each other out and I respect that massively. Absolutely. Awesome. Yeah. So, feel free to sign up. I think after this video the price is
4:18:23
going up, right? So, if you want to sign up, sign up right now before the prices go up cuz literally we'll give everyone
4:18:28
like 30 minutes and then we'll put the price up again. But yeah, it's just an a community focused on making money and
4:18:34
saving time with AI. And then additionally, if you want to get a free one-to-one SEO strategy session that shows you how we get thousands of
4:18:40
visitors to our clients websites and if you want to customers or maybe you're tired of spending money on ads, maybe
4:18:46
you want exponentially, then feel free to book that in. It's completely free link in the comments description to get a free SEO strategy session. Anything
4:18:53
else you want to say before you go, Big? No. Look forward to meeting all of you in the air profit boardroom. This was
4:18:58
awesome, Julian. I learned a lot about, you know, Boomerang and Root Code. Can't wait to test it myself. But yeah,
4:19:04
perfect. Perfect execution here. All right. Appreciate it, man. Cheers. Cheers. Gemini 2.5 Pro versus Chat GPT3.
4:19:14
Who is the winner? Today we're going to be testing out a bunch of prompts and seeing which one gives the best outputs.
4:19:20
Now 03 is just been released this week. Gemini came out last month. A lot of
4:19:26
people already saying that Gemini is the goat of coding. We'll test that out today and just see, okay, who's winning,
4:19:32
who's the best, which one gives us the best outputs in real time live. So let's
4:19:38
get straight into this. Now, if you're wondering, okay, how do the benchmarks compare? For example, we'll run through
4:19:44
these in a second. This is an amazing website by the way, docsbot.ai. And you can compare both models.
4:19:50
Obviously, Gemini 2.5 Pro comes from Google. And you've got 03 that comes directly from Open AI. Now, if we
4:19:57
compare the stats right here side by side, you can see for the input context,
4:20:03
window 03 allows 200k tokens, which is significantly less than Gemini 2.5's Pro
4:20:11
tokens, which apparently is also going to be introducing 2 million soon, which is pretty insane when you think about
4:20:17
it. Terms of maximum output tokens, 64K for Gemini 2.5 versus 100K open source.
4:20:24
Obviously, both models are not open source. And then the release date when
4:20:29
the model was first released. So, this just came out a few days ago on April the 16th. And on March the 25th, 25 days
4:20:36
ago, Google Gemini came out. The knowledge cutoff date is quite significant too. So, you can see here 03
4:20:43
cut off May the 31st whereas Gemini's cut off date is January 2025. However,
4:20:50
you can for example inside chat GPT just enable search and then it can search in real time based on what just happened.
4:20:56
All right, so you can connect 03 to the internet using that method. In terms of API providers, you can get these on open
4:21:04
AI API but you can also get them on open router as well. We'll be testing like how it performs in terms of the API but
4:21:10
also directly inside the chat here. And then pricing comparison, this is a huge difference. So, in terms of input
4:21:16
tokens, right, the cost per million tokens from 03 is $10 per million
4:21:22
tokens, which is way more expensive, almost 10 times more expensive than Gemini 2.5 Pro. And the output is $40
4:21:30
per million tokens versus $10 per million tokens from 2.5 Pro.
4:21:35
Big difference in the token costs here. You can also see the benchmark comparison. Maybe we'll show that in a second, but I don't want to bore you to
4:21:41
death with the statistics. So, let's get straight into testing out which one performs best in terms of creating
4:21:49
stuff. So, we're going to be testing stuff like games, science, onepage websites, SEO prompts, tools, and full
4:21:55
websites as well today and just breaking down these bad boys and seeing which one performs the best. By the way, all these
4:22:01
prompts, tips, workflows, etc. inside the AI Profit Boardroom, the one and only link in the comments description.
4:22:08
So, let's get straight into this. What we're going to do is we're going to plug in this basic prompt which is just make
4:22:14
me a captivating endless runner game. Key instructions on the screen blah blah blah. I like pixelated dinosaurs and
4:22:19
interesting backgrounds. We're going to get straight into something else which is creating a self-playing soccer game.
4:22:25
All right, so let's get straight into that. We do the same inside both inside 03 as well and we can see how they
4:22:32
perform. Now, one of the first things you're probably going to notice here is that from what I've seen, let's I don't
4:22:39
want to say anything too early, actually. I'm just going to let this see how it rolls out. We'll see how it performs. But from what I've seen so
4:22:45
far, 03 seems to be faster, but we'll see how they perform. All right. So, we're getting the p5 js code back from
4:22:53
both of them right here. So, let's see what we get. And then we'll run that through the p5 js web editor and we'll
4:23:00
compare them side by side in a sec as well. Right, here we go. So, we got the code back from Gemini Pro Advanced.
4:23:08
Let's copy that and we'll test out inside P5GS. Hit play. And we have a playing soccer game. It reminds me of
4:23:14
Football Manager back in the day, but it seems to be repeating the same loop over and over again. Let's see what happens next. Ah, the Blues are absolutely
4:23:21
destroying them, but it's a bit weird. If you look at the way it's simulated, it's like they all just gather together
4:23:27
in a weird block, which is quite strange. Now let's compare the output
4:23:32
from 03. All right. So this is the output from Gemini and then let's grab
4:23:39
the output from Chachi Petite 03. There's not even a goal. Look at that.
4:23:45
There's no net for this is really weird. So if you look at the Let's stop that and I'll play it again. You see how
4:23:52
there's no net on this side of for the football match. And also it seems super buggy. Like where's the red team gone?
4:23:58
It's only blues now. So, if I had to compare them side by side, I'm gonna say, and this is Chat GPT's output, for
4:24:06
sure, Gemini 2.5 Pro wins by a long way there. And a lot of people saying from
4:24:11
their test as well, this is not just my opinion, but a lot of people are saying from 2.5 Pro, it's the best of tested
4:24:18
for coding and analyzing just in general. Flash, if you've not tested it
4:24:24
before, so 2.0 Flash just came out yesterday. If you've not tested that
4:24:29
before, then I would definitely recommend checking out my video from yesterday about it. Honestly, I was very underwhelmed. I don't want to hype it up
4:24:36
and BS you and tell you it's the best thing since sliced bread and fish and chips if it's not. And it certainly
4:24:41
isn't, mate. So, I'm not going to use 2.5 Flash again. I think it it didn't impress me at all. All right. So, let's
4:24:47
keep going through now. So, you can see here so far. And I'll make a little list of this if we put this on Google Docs.
4:24:55
So, in fact, we'll do this on a cheeky Google sheet. So, it just looks a bit better. All right. If we had to compare
4:25:00
him, who's the winner for the football test, the football simulator game? By
4:25:05
far, it is Gemini 2.5 Pro. All right, so we've got the winner for the first test.
4:25:11
Look at this beautiful spreadsheet. This is years of spreadsheets paying off right here. Let's delete that. Pop those
4:25:18
in. So, test number Uno. We have got the football simulator game Gemini 2.5 Pro
4:25:25
won by a long way. Right there you can see it with the UI. Let's keep going now. So we're going to test out creating
4:25:33
a 3D car simulator. All right. So let's plug these in. We'll start a new chat
4:25:39
just to get it rolling and remove the content. Let's see what we get. Now the one thing that I would say is a caveat
4:25:45
to this is like we're using these prompts, right? But depending on which AI you use the most, there is a clear
4:25:53
winner for self coaching. Right? So if you need to help making business decisions, if you ever coach yourself,
4:25:59
like for me, I do a lot of reflecting and journaling and that sort of thing, Chad GPT is amazing, particularly 03 for
4:26:07
getting like really good advice based on what it knows about you, right? So for example, if I go into chat GPT 03 and
4:26:14
I'm like knowing what you know about me, right? because it it remembers pretty much every conversation we've had. Give
4:26:20
me some advice or tell me something I don't know or for example an help me answer this question. What do I need to
4:26:26
eliminate to move further on my goals, etc. 03 is almost AGI level for that. I
4:26:32
would say it's absolutely amazing for that. I'm not going to show it cuz it's super personal and it's going to be super personalized to me. But I will say
4:26:38
that for self coaching 03 wins hands down. But maybe we'll pull that up in a
4:26:43
second, but I'll try and keep it like private and that sort of thing. So let's copy that. And this is from 03 for the
4:26:48
second test. And the second test is the car game. All right, car game. So let's
4:26:57
see what we get back. We're going to run the output from chat GBT3 first. So
4:27:03
let's see what we got. And that is doing it inside HTML. So I'll run it through LiveWeave, not P5GS. Here we go. And we
4:27:09
have a blue screen. Honestly, I think I tested this a couple of days ago and it gave us a way better output. But from
4:27:15
what I can see, that is terrible. Absolutely terrible. All right, that is
4:27:21
giving us nothing. Nothing. All right, so let's go back to Gemini 2.5 Pro. I
4:27:28
want to see is this giving us Maybe this is in P5 JS. I just need to test this out. No, it's not working in P5 Jets.
4:27:34
All right, so let's go back to Gemini. Gemini says it can't help us assist on that, but it's Why does it stop there?
4:27:42
It's failed the test. I'm going to give Pro another sort of just another opportunity because for
4:27:48
some reason it got confused there. And I'll run it through AI Studio instead because it seemed to to get confused
4:27:53
inside the chat. Let's see what we get back. A lot of people saying it's good that Google is the best. I'm interested
4:27:59
to know more on that. There's some people prefer Google over Chat GPT and OpenAI. I'd be interested to know more
4:28:04
on that. For me, like chat GPT and OpenAI in general, it does get a lot of
4:28:09
hate. A lot of people hate on them. So, I'm interested to know why that is. The other thing is as well, right, if you're
4:28:15
using Google products a lot like Google Drive, Gmail, etc., then you can imagine
4:28:21
as these models get more advanced, you're going to be more and more in the ecosystem. For example, the iPhone and
4:28:26
the Mac and how that all syncs up. It's the same with the Google ecosystem, right? If you run your business on
4:28:31
Google, then it's going to be much easier to integrate that. It's like a soft thing. I can't measure any tests,
4:28:37
but yeah, I would say for sure like that's going to help and that's only going to advance more and more over the
4:28:43
time. All right, so here's what chat GBT gave us. Chachbt03,
4:28:49
he gave us this the most advanced OpenAI model in the world. Now, here's what Gemini 2.5 Pro gave us, right? A million
4:28:56
times better. Million times better. All right, so let's see what we got here. Oh, it's just incredible, isn't it? Look
4:29:03
at that. We're flying through. We're roaming around. We're having a great time. It must be a Tesla. Those buttons
4:29:09
don't work, but I'll let them off because the game actually works on ChibiTs. All right. And 3D graphics are
4:29:16
not bad at all with that little train going around, roaming around. You can't argue with that. How that goes pretty
4:29:22
far back as well, doesn't it? You got a nice little circular train route right here. Beautiful. Let's try and find the
4:29:28
train. That is amazing to be fair. Look at the landscape. It's just incredible. We're just zooming around and we
4:29:33
literally build that in one single prompt. How good could you make that game if you actually spend a bit of time on it. So for sure Gemini 2.5 Pro is
4:29:43
just absolutely steaming ahead right now and 03 is struggling my friends. So
4:29:48
let's try something else. Now we've tested the game prompts. I'm not going to do too many more games cuz that's not what makes you money in life. What we're
4:29:55
going to do next is we're going to try and create a onepage website. So, I'm going to say generate a high converting
4:30:01
landing page blah blah blah from SEO agency. I'm going to see if they can actually research information about me as well, but we'll come on to that in a
4:30:07
second. So, if I put canvas on right here, we'll put the canvas here and we'll see research Julian Goldie and his
4:30:15
agency. Then generate high converted landing page for his SEO
4:30:22
agency blah blah blah. We'll do that and we'll do the same inside chat GPT03
4:30:27
which so far has let us down quite considerably but we'll give it another cheeky. The good thing about this is I
4:30:33
can search the web right so I can search the web with chat GP3 which is probably going to make the outputs better but
4:30:38
we'll test that in a sec. We can do grounding with Google search as well. So we can use Google search inside here. So
4:30:43
I'll do that inside AI studio. I'll use Google search as well to use the same prompt and see what we get back in a
4:30:49
sec. I like the fact as well that chat GBT brings up the canvas. So you can integrate the search with the canvas.
4:30:55
I'm pretty let's have a look. I'm pretty sure Google Gemini advanced inside the chat here where you get the canvas
4:31:00
option. You can't connect to Google search as far as I'm aware. It's just using it knowledge already. If we go
4:31:06
inside AI studio which is using Gemini 2.5 Pro as well, it should be able to research Google. You can see here we're
4:31:13
grounding with Google search and then we'll see what we get back. Some people were saying that Grock would beat Gemini
4:31:18
2.5 Pro. And to that, I would say check out my video comparing Grock and all the
4:31:24
other models versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. Personally, I wasn't impressed. Like the first day I started using it was
4:31:30
amazing. And then after that, it seemed to get dialed down. Like it just didn't give me the same outputs as that. I
4:31:36
wasn't that impressed. I just don't use Grock anymore for that reason. Compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro and Chachi Petite, I
4:31:42
just don't think you get the same outputs. So, can we run this? I don't think we can on the canvas, but we'll
4:31:48
run this inside LiveWave anyway and see what we get back. So, let's plug that in. Here's the landing page. It's not
4:31:55
bad at all. Let's see if it's got any information about me. It's got a little bit of information, but it's still quite
4:32:00
generic. Organic growth, authoritative link building, technical SEO, content, blah blah blah. It's still quite generic
4:32:07
information, right, that it's finding you. To be honest, you're going to get much better outputs from something like
4:32:12
Gen Sparker Manus if you do this job. But it's not bad. Let's have a look what we got back from chat GPT03. So, let's
4:32:19
click on preview. See what we got. Well, like that. I would say both of them were pretty poor there. I'm not going to hide
4:32:25
this up and tell you like this is amazing. This is super basic. Look at that. I'm a little bit disappointed.
4:32:30
Come on to coding with the API. Maybe that will give us better output since R code in a second. But these are not
4:32:37
great. These are not great. And I think that's actually unless I'm Yeah, I think that's a madeup hallucinated testimonial
4:32:43
as well. I don't think that's a real testimonial as far as I'm aware. We have a lot of testimonials, so it's hard to keep track, but that seems totally
4:32:52
misleading. If I'm going to compare them, I'm going to say that Gemini 2.5 Pro created a much better landing page.
4:32:58
Like, it's longer, it's better designed, the testimonials
4:33:03
are actually real. For example, like this one and this one. This one too, it's using real case studies and the
4:33:09
design is much better. Plus, there's more content on the page. Right? If we have a look at the chat GPT output,
4:33:15
super basic, doesn't look great. You would never publish that, right? You never in a
4:33:20
million years. So, I'm going to go with Gemini 2.5 Pro again. All right. And you
4:33:26
can see here Gemini 2.5 Pro is absolutely crushing chat on all these
4:33:32
benchmarks so far, which is pretty wild. Let's go on to the next task. I've never
4:33:38
actually seen a test this unanimous. It's unbelievable. So, let's come on to
4:33:43
another one. We're going to say, okay, create a beautifully designed snow day calculator inside both of these. We use
4:33:50
Gemini 2.5 Pro inside Canvas. By the way, someone was asking me yesterday on
4:33:56
the live stream like, "How do you get the preview on Gemini?" So, if you're using Gemini Advance, which is a paid
4:34:01
version, and then you click Canvas over here, then you can start using the canvas inside 2.5 Pro. It will give you
4:34:07
an actual preview. But it's so far from what I can see, Gemini 2.5 Pro is just absolutely destroying chat 3, which is
4:34:15
blowing my mind cuz this came out nearly a month ago. So, we've got the snow day
4:34:21
calculator back from chat 3. It's not bad. It's not bad at all. It works.
4:34:27
Let's test this out. Need to find a US zip code right here. All right, let's take that. It's not working, is it? I'm
4:34:33
clicking calculator here, but nothing is working. All right, let's check out Gemini 215 Pro. So, straight away, you
4:34:38
can see from the UI, right? Look at this. You see how there's like a nice little icon here for the snow day
4:34:46
calculator and there's like estimate the likelihood of snow day. Like the content itself is written much nicer. This
4:34:52
calculator actually doesn't work from Chad GPT. So, I've tested clicking calculate. Nothing happens. Now, let's
4:34:58
go over to Gemini. The writing is way more humanized in terms of how it's written. And then we'll put the
4:35:06
form in here. Hopefully, it works. Calculate probability actually works. All right. And it's actually, look at
4:35:12
the way that it's written. Get the sleds ready. The snow date is looking very likely. If you compare that to this one,
4:35:19
like number one, it doesn't work, but number two, like the content is really just AI. It feels like AI. There's no
4:35:25
life in it, right? And then if you look at the way the the heading is designed, just little touches like the icons here
4:35:32
make the Gemini Pro calculator a lot better. So, Snow Day calculator, Gemini
4:35:39
2.5 Pro is just absolutely destroying Chad GBT. It's absolutely redonkulous. All right. By the way, if you want all
4:35:45
these prompts, just get them inside the AI profit bordering. This also comes with a community focus on just making
4:35:52
more money and saving time with AI based on how we've implemented all our systems. So a lot of people talk about
4:35:57
using AI. They talk about how to scale with it. But there's nothing practical in there. Whereas for example, we've actually taken all the systems that
4:36:05
we've used to grow and scale our business. For example, we reach millions of people on YouTube each month. We
4:36:10
reach millions of people on Twitter each month. We have a big email list, etc. And we've automated all this stuff using
4:36:16
AI and all the systems right here in the crash course. So if you want to steal our best systems, get them inside the AI
4:36:22
profit boardroom along with weekly Q&A calls, all our best SPs and an amazing
4:36:27
community of people. You can have 670 members here. Any questions you have about AI and then we're happy to help
4:36:33
you. Like you can see inside the community, everything is getting an answer quickly. All right. So, let's
4:36:39
jump straight into this and we'll get back in the reins here. So, let's pull
4:36:45
this up. What we're going to do next is we're going to try and create like a five-page website. This might take a little bit longer to test out. So, we're
4:36:52
going to go inside Visual Studio Code over here. And I'll use Root Code for doing this. All right. And then we're
4:36:59
going to go inside the settings and we'll select Gemini 2.5 Pro to begin
4:37:05
with and just test this out. All right, I'll use the paid version just so that we don't run out of tokens, but you can
4:37:10
use the free version on open router. That's another thing here is like you can actually code for free with Gemini
4:37:16
2.5 Pro, whereas you can't use chat GBT for free, right? Unless you were rinsing
4:37:22
the trials that I was telling you about last week for Optimus Alpha. So, we're going to say, okay, create a fivepage
4:37:28
website for Julian Gold's SEO agency, blah blah blah. We'll run that through root code here and we'll see what we get
4:37:33
back. Now, if you're choosing between using the chat interface or you're using like R code and Visual Studio Code, by
4:37:40
the way, I have SOPs on all this stuff below, then what you're going to find is
4:37:45
that for creating bigger projects, this is much better to use inside Visual Studio Code. However, if you want to
4:37:52
create like just a onepage landing page or a quick calculator, etc., then it'd be much better to use the chat interface
4:37:59
directly. It's going to be quicker, it's going to easier, you're going to be messing around less, etc. Now just whilst we're waiting for that to load,
4:38:05
you might be wondering, okay, what are like the technical benchmark comparisons like in terms of performance metrics. So
4:38:10
if we have a look here, Global MMLU is not available for 03, but for Gemini 2.5
4:38:16
Pro, it is 89.8%. You can see for diamond science, Gemini 2.5 Pro is just outperforming 03. For
4:38:24
competition maths and Amy tests, Gemini 2.5 Pro, humanities last exam 03 is
4:38:31
winning. S swe benchmarks, so software engineering capabilities. 03 is
4:38:36
outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro, but I just I don't see that in my own tests. And then MMU,
4:38:43
it's a massive multi-task, multimodal understanding, they're tied, but 03 is beating it by
4:38:50
about 1.2%. But again, I don't really honestly I don't trust these benchmarks.
4:38:56
Only trust my own tests. I always think that's the best way. So, let's see what we get back from 2.5 Pro right now.
4:39:03
Pretty bad website to be honest with you, but it works. It's super basic. You'd have to spend a lot more time just
4:39:09
coding out, building out, but you can see here it does actually work. It has c created like a five-page website. You
4:39:15
need to go back and forth with Gemini 2.5 Pro. I would give that a five out of 10. All right, as a oneshot prompt.
4:39:22
Let's run the same thing now using 03 directly. So, we're going to take the
4:39:28
same prompt and then we're going to start a new task. We'll go inside the settings and switch over to 03. All
4:39:34
right. Open AI 03. Make sure you don't select the mini model. You want to be using 03, which is the latest model
4:39:40
here. And then we'll go inside here and we'll give exactly the same prompt to chat 03. See what we get back. And we're
4:39:48
getting an error right there. That is not ideal, mate. What's going on here, sunshine? All right. Maybe we'll switch
4:39:55
to Open AI directly. Just going to have Oh, look at that. Your organization must
4:40:00
be verified to use this model. All right. So, it's not working on Open Router. And it's not working. Let's see
4:40:05
if we can. No, we can't. Open 3 is not working in Rico. That is so weird. Let me try a client instead. Not a great
4:40:12
start there. Let's switch over to client. But again, okay, what's working? What's not here? So, Gemini 2.5 Pro work
4:40:18
perfectly inside Open Router. Let's test out and we'll just grab a new API key from Open Routter. If you ever need to
4:40:24
know how to do that, just log into OpenAI, grab a key, and then you can create a key here. I'm just going to do
4:40:30
that in the background in a sec. Run over to Visual Studio Code, plug the new API open router key here, hit done, and
4:40:38
let's retry that. You kidding me? 03 is just not working on the API. That's crazy.
4:40:44
All right, that settles it. So, five page websites, Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, just to recap here,
4:40:52
this is blowing my mind because I've never seen anything as objective as this. It's weird and feels biased, but
4:40:59
it's not. So, test number one, the football simulator game 2.5 Pro smashed it. Test number two, the car game Gemini
4:41:06
2.5 Pro landing page Gemini Snow Day Gemini and five-page website open router
4:41:14
wasn't working. 03 inside the playground wasn't working for me because I had to verify my business which means I can't
4:41:20
actually start using the API. Massive problem. That is a full suite, my
4:41:25
friends. That is a full house that Gemini has. Crazy stuff. Crazy stuff.
4:41:31
I've never seen that before. I'm absolutely gobsmacked if that's an actual phrase. All right, I'm not going
4:41:36
to do any more full website tests inside root code or anything like that because, you know, it doesn't work. Let's give it
4:41:42
one more shot. I'm going to give this one more opportunity. 03. We're going to try and build a retro keyboard here. So,
4:41:49
let's go back into 03. Feels pointless at this point, but I just want to be I
4:41:54
want to give them a shot. I want to give them a cheeky chance. All right. So, we're going to say build a retro synth
4:42:01
keyboard in HTML. We'll do the same inside Gemini and we'll see what we get back, peeps. Here's the code. Let's give
4:42:07
it a cheeky whirl. I don't know why it didn't let me test that in canvas to be honest with you. But anyway, let's plug
4:42:13
this in. So, this is the output from Chat GBT. It's not looking bad. It's not bad. Let's test this out. All right, it
4:42:18
works perfectly. It work. It definitely makes a noise. Here is the single HTML file. Copy and paste it in the browser.
4:42:25
Let me just delete those at the top. There it is looking pretty retro. We'll just delete the HTML code at the top.
4:42:31
There we go. We got the retro simp. Not bad at all, my friends. Not bad at all. Let's check out Gemini now. I should
4:42:38
have tested in canvas. Rookie error there. Let me build it again with the canvas enabled. It's got
4:42:44
Yeah. So, let's see what we got here. So, we got the Retro Synth keyboard. It works perfectly. We can switch between
4:42:50
waveforms and we can change the volume as well. So, that's working really nicely. Now, let's check out the Retro
4:42:56
Synth. The main thing that I would say here is like the UI is pretty nice on Chat GT, but there's no volume. There's
4:43:03
no switching between waveforms. The keyboard itself looks tiny on the preview, which is weird. Like all this
4:43:09
black space. I'm going to have to say my friends retro synth keyboard. I'm going with Gemini 2.5 Pro. All right. And the
4:43:16
reason for that is it's got the waveform UI here. It's a much bigger keyboard preview. The you can switch on the
4:43:23
volume. Again, 2.5 Pro absolutely smashes it. So overall, you can see who
4:43:29
the clear winner is. You can see who I'm going to stick with. But just over the last sort 30 days, Google was really
4:43:34
stepped up. like Gemini 2.5, sorry, Gemini Advanced Pro was never something on my radar up to about 30 days ago. So,
4:43:42
you can see who wins. You can see who the winner is. It's unanimous. Absolutely unanimous. So, thanks so much
4:43:48
for watching. If you want to get a community packed full of people focused on making money, saving time with AI, feel free to give that inside the AR
4:43:54
profit boarding link in the comments description. Inside the classroom here, you're going to get all my best workflows that tried, tested, and
4:44:00
proven, and it's way better. On top of that, also, you're going to get a crash course based on everything I've
4:44:06
practically implemented into my business right here. So, you can steal all my same systems, my best SPs as well.
4:44:12
There's tons of SPS in there. You can watch back previous Q&A call recordings, plus join the weekly Q&A calls like you
4:44:19
can see on the weekly schedule here. And on top of that, you can post inside the community and add 670 members any
4:44:25
questions that you have about AI that you're struggling with. On top of that, if you want to get a free one-to-one SEO
4:44:30
strategy session that shows you how to get more leads, traffic, and sales, feel free to get that link in the comments
4:44:37
description. And we'll show you how we take websites from zero to 145,000
4:44:42
business month and generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales and autopilot on this free SEO acceleration
4:44:48
session. You're going to get a custom tailored game plan to generate more lead, sales, and profits based on what's working for us. And you'll also be able
4:44:55
to ask any questions you have onetoone on the call. So feel free to get that link in the comments in description and
4:45:00
I will see you on the next one. Cheers. Cursor and Gemini 2.5 Pro are absolutely
4:45:07
insane. I actually just built this Tetris game in one single click. I'll show you exactly how to do it, but it
4:45:13
works perfectly. So you can see here, for example, we've got all the pieces of Tetris puzzle. We can move them around.
4:45:21
We can switch these back in over here. And this is just working beautifully.
4:45:26
All right. It's incredibly easy to set this up using Gemini Pro. Now, I actually think from what I've seen on
4:45:32
the tests and when I've been building with it, Gemini Pro seems to actually be better than Claude in many ways, Claude
4:45:38
3.7 Sonic, but the difference is of course if you're coding directly with AI Studio and AI studio.google.com,
4:45:46
then you can actually get free API. So you can code for free using this and then build whatever you want like games,
4:45:51
tools, apps, websites. This is just one silly little example, but you can see how easy it is and the features
4:45:58
functions perfectly. All right, so if you want to set something like this up, what you can do is you can download
4:46:03
cursor and then inside cursor for example, literally all we said was like create a
4:46:09
Tetris game right here. And then you can see it went off and coded it and created the logic.
4:46:15
And then we've actually got the index html ready to go. And if you want to
4:46:20
choose Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental, you just click it down here. You can also
4:46:25
switch between auto select. So cursor can switch between them. And you can also enable thinking, but for this
4:46:31
project, I didn't even enable thinking. It was really simple and easy to do. And then it coded out the HTML over here.
4:46:37
And if we open that up in Finder, so we'll open that up. And then if we grab a new Chrome, plug this in over here,
4:46:46
you can see it's ready to go. If you actually want to host something like this, you can go over to Netifi.
4:46:52
So we can log into Netifi over here, add a new site, import an existing project,
4:46:59
grab the folder. All right, so you just grab that folder and then plug it into Netify Drop right here. Pretty simple
4:47:06
stuff. Really easy to do. So, let's try and build some more stuff with this right now. Just going to open up new
4:47:12
tab. So, a new chat over here. We've got Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. And I'm
4:47:18
going to say, okay, create a really sleek and interesting keyword research tool
4:47:26
for SEO. Make the design the best it can be. All right.
4:47:33
And then I'm going to say okay and promote these links
4:47:38
with Alex for mozzy style sales copyrighting through app. And then we'll
4:47:43
put the funnel links underneath like you can see
4:47:48
and then all we need to do here is just hit send and that should start doing its magic. All right. Now you can use
4:47:54
something like for example Visual Studio Code and then you can start from there
4:48:00
using R code or client to build something similar but honestly it's going to run
4:48:06
out of tries pretty quickly. That's the problem is like when you're building stuff out with the main API from Gemini
4:48:13
it seems to hit the limit on requests really quickly. So for example, if we select Google Gemini Pro Experimental
4:48:18
inside, for example, R code here, we'll test out the results side by side. So
4:48:25
I'll take exactly the same prompt and we'll test the results. All right, so we're going to plug this into Visual
4:48:30
Studio Code. We're using Google Gemini to build that out and we'll see what it comes back
4:48:36
with in a second. All right, so you see here how there's an error. Super annoy. So we've hit the limits. it says
4:48:43
resource exhausted and so that's the problem right now it seems like the API is just being rinsed and super hard to
4:48:49
use whereas for example we've got the file ready to go so it's created the
4:48:56
HTML etc to make this fully functional blah blah blah we'll accept all the
4:49:02
files let's just see what that looks like so far so this on a new tab grab
4:49:08
the index html and there we go keyword research tool ready to Let's press this
4:49:13
now. Is it working? Yeah. Look at that. Perfect. All right. So, if you compare the difference here, like cursor is way
4:49:19
better for coding with Gemini 2.5 Pro. Obviously, this is mock data. So, you would want to insert like API
4:49:26
integration. We can actually do that in a second. And then you can see on the page here, it's got links to our funnels. Right now, if you compare this
4:49:33
versus what Root Code did. So, if we go back to Visual Studio Code, I am a big
4:49:38
fan of R code actually. But you can see here how it's not going to go off and do stuff for us like we have to click run
4:49:43
command. We have to mess around quite a bit. Whereas inside cursor, we're good to go on that, right? We just give it
4:49:49
one prompt. It's like boom, here you go. And you've got that page ready to go. What we can try from here is setting up
4:49:55
the API integration. I also like the fact that it's told us this is mock data, right? So the AI is not trying to
4:50:01
mislead us and tell us, oh yeah, this is ready to go, etc. It's just found mock
4:50:06
data. So, what we're going to do now is we'll go back to cursor, open this chat up, and we're going to
4:50:12
say from here, okay, create the back end API integration with
4:50:19
chat GBT API, plus make the design
4:50:26
more modern, interesting, and sleek. And now you can see it's
4:50:31
beginning to code all of that out. So it seems a lot more autonomous whereas for example if we go back to root code here
4:50:37
we have to keep clicking save and go ahead and all that sort of thing. The biggest difference though however of
4:50:43
course is like cursor is like $20 a month for the pro plan like this but if
4:50:49
you get better results you save time it's 100% worth it whereas for example root code it's free but it's going to
4:50:57
take you more time and then you have to click save and run and everything else as you keep going through this. Also, I
4:51:02
think this will run out of API requests, whereas inside cursor, it's going to start doing its magic pretty quickly.
4:51:08
So, let's see what we got here. Next step is build back end, integrate the Open AI. Okay. And I'm going to say,
4:51:16
okay, create this, but let the user insert
4:51:21
their own API key into it. And so, like you can build your own sort
4:51:26
of SAS tools, apps, or whatever you want using this process. Pretty simple and easy. So it's beginning to do its magic
4:51:32
right here. You can see it's editing the code. Okay. So now it says now the user can enter their keyword and open API
4:51:38
key. When they click find keywords now the browser will directly query the open AI API key and show the
4:51:46
formatted text response from chat GPT in the results area. Remember the security implications of the front end only
4:51:53
approach. If you use front end instead of creating like a whole backend server and obviously it's going to be a lot
4:51:58
faster and easier to implement. So, what we're going to do is we're going to right click index.html. Bear in mind, like I'm not really a cursor expert, but
4:52:06
it's pretty easy to set up, right? Like, it's quite intuitive. It's really easy and clean to set up. So, now we can
4:52:12
insert the API key and we can plug in our keyword. So, I'm just going to grab
4:52:17
from OpenAI an API key here. All right. So,
4:52:22
if we go to platform.openai.com and I'll grab an API key. Just go to
4:52:28
dashboard and then API keys over here. Hit create new secret key. Obviously,
4:52:33
I'm going to delete this afterwards, but I'm just showing you as an example. And let's just check this actually works cuz
4:52:38
sometimes you can build this stuff out with, for example, bolt, but bolt new and tools like that,
4:52:45
like they often break when you're using the API key. So, let's see what we get here. We're going to click find keywords. Now, it's asking the AI. It
4:52:52
looks like it's actually used the AI. So, it worked perfectly first time around, but you see how the UI is number
4:52:58
one, not that nice. Number two, it should be generating the results really here. Like, we need to make it cleaner.
4:53:03
So, I'm just going to take these actions and put it here and say make the UI
4:53:11
cleaner, more modern, and better designed.
4:53:17
Make it the best it can be for front end design, right? Then for the keyword results,
4:53:26
make this feel like a beautiful sasttol. What else do we need to do here? So, we're going to go back here. Yeah, it's
4:53:33
super bland right now the way it's designed. And also, there's like lots of space on the page. So much space on the
4:53:39
page. And it's way too bland. I'm also going to say also give me search volumes,
4:53:46
keyword difficulty, etc. on keyword research
4:53:52
the best you can possibly be. So the other cool thing here as well is like we can switch between API keys
4:53:58
really quickly. So you know if we wanted to say use claw 3.7 sonet max which is
4:54:04
typically better for front end and usually more expensive but we're using this inside cursor so it should be a lot
4:54:10
easier then we should be able to get better results. We can switch between them or we can
4:54:16
just use think auto select and get it to do that. It's magic right there. But it's pretty good as well. So, let's see
4:54:21
what we get back here. I also like the speed of this. Like, you can see how fast this is. Whereas, you know, quite
4:54:26
often if you're using R code, recode has not even created the tool yet. We're still waiting for that to be done.
4:54:33
This requires like a lot more button pressing and just going yes, approve, etc. Even when it's selected on auto
4:54:38
approve. So, it's created this tool. So, this is the tool from Brew Code. If we hit run command here, let's see what we
4:54:45
got. I actually prefer to be fair, the front end of Root Code for the tool is much nicer than the front end from
4:54:52
Cursor, which is pretty interesting. But let's go back here. We'll type this in.
4:54:57
See what we got. It's got a nice little CTA there as well. And we didn't have to prompt it properly for that either.
4:55:03
Let's go back to cursor. All right. So, it's promising me that this will be a lot nicer. Let's have a look. See what
4:55:10
we got here. So, we open up the new version. Plug it in. Here we go.
4:55:17
And we've got the keyword. Let's grab the API key. Hit find keywords.
4:55:25
And it's generating over here. So, it does look better. It's not perfect, but this looks a lot nicer than it was
4:55:31
previously. So, it says find winning keywords, AICO, find keywords, plugged in the API key. Works perfectly. It's
4:55:38
also got some nice CTAs here. I just think we need to change the color scheme of the page, but it's looking decent.
4:55:44
And then we've got the keywords and estimated volume and all that sort of thing. It also says found gold. Turn
4:55:49
those keywords into cash. Learn the SEO Elite Circle blueprint at the bottom. So, we're beginning to get something
4:55:55
that looks better, right? It's got a lot more functionality than it did previously. Like, this is the old
4:56:00
version. It was pretty nasty, but this version is a lot nicer. So, let's go
4:56:05
back now. And I'm going to say, okay, the design has to be
4:56:11
more beautiful, sleek, interesting, and modern. Right now, the
4:56:18
page background is just white, and it doesn't feel modern at all. I
4:56:24
say, could you create something that's really sleek, like for example,
4:56:30
the UI of Airbnb, something like that. Give you some examples. See if that improves it. We'll wait for that to
4:56:37
generate, see what we get back. But you can see the evolution is pretty big between the first generation versus the
4:56:43
generation that came after that. Looks a lot nicer with all these ratings and that sort of thing. Here we go. Open
4:56:49
that up. I hope this looks a lot nicer. Let's see what we get here. It's just not that interesting, is it? So average.
4:56:58
All right, here's what we're going to do. So I'm going to say use my brand colors. I
4:57:05
say add like animations relevant SEO icons
4:57:12
make the page fun interesting book 10. This is a 100 million
4:57:20
SAS tool. I think part of the game here is like just figuring out what prompts are going
4:57:25
to get the best out of this page. So, I'm going to run that again. Does seem
4:57:31
insistent on just having a blank white screen, which doesn't make any sense at all. The images are looking better. I
4:57:36
mean, the buttons here are looking better. Let's see what we get back. Now, in the meantime, I'm just going to open
4:57:42
up a new window. And what you can also do if you go to your settings over here is you've got a bunch of new features,
4:57:48
right? So, for example, if you go to MCP over here, you can actually add MCP servers inside Cursor as well. And then
4:57:56
you have it looks like you have to create an MCP file for that to work. Also got a bunch of features here. Some
4:58:02
new rules. So you can add like different rules inside here as well. And then you can select which keys you want to use.
4:58:08
Now if you want to use your Google API key directly, you can just plug in here. Same for anthropic and open AI as well
4:58:14
and Azure. So Azure will help you. I think you can for example like host that
4:58:21
through the Azure API. And then there's also a bunch of new features here. I've not used this for a while, so that's why
4:58:27
I'm saying, but you've got, for example, like the web search tool. You have all these sort of auto excepts
4:58:35
or partial excepts. And yeah, it's definitely improved a lot since I last used cursor. So, let's go back here. We
4:58:42
should have this ready to go. There we go. Now we're talking. Now we're talking, my friends. All right. So,
4:58:49
let's try this again. Now, let me grab this API key. Plug it in here. We'll put, for example, SEO agency.
4:58:57
Hit find keywords. Do these links work? Yeah, we're good to go on those.
4:59:04
Beautiful. And then you can see on the results here, it's broken it down. So, we've got
4:59:10
the keyword phase, SEO, agency, estimated volume, difficulty, CPC, andformational, right? So, whether it's
4:59:16
like for example a commercial intent, navigational, informational, etc. And we're good to go on that. And then yeah,
4:59:22
that is looking a lot nicer. I think that's actually probably ready to deploy. So what we're going to do from
4:59:27
here is we shall let's go down here. Let's have
4:59:34
a look. So if we go into this review on Finder going to copy those files
4:59:43
and then we'll create a new folder and we'll call this keyword tool.
4:59:49
All right. And then I'll show you how to deploy this as well. So if we paste in those files over here. All right. And
4:59:54
then we're going to go over to Netlify and I'll deploy this so that you can use it as well if you want to. All right. So
5:00:00
we'll import this. Try netify drop. We'll grab the folder that we just
5:00:06
created. Just plug that in. Wait for that to upload.
5:00:12
And then boom. Look at that. It's hosted on a subdomain. So we got that ready to go. It's hosted at netify.app. You can
5:00:18
test out if you want to. You just copy that URL. I'll include it inside the AI profit boardroom as well along with an SP if you want to steal this from me.
5:00:24
But essentially, that's how easy it is to create like a nice looking SAS tool that works with an API key using cursor
5:00:30
and Gemini 2.5 Pro, right? And also you can see how easy it was to
5:00:36
build Tetris using this process. Like you can build apps, tools, games,
5:00:41
whatever. And Gemini seems to be a lot better for building games out, right? Really simple and easy to do. So, thanks
5:00:48
so much for watching. If you want to get the SP from today, feel free to get that inside the AI profit boardroom. This

5:02:07
in the comments and the description. The new Google Gemini 2.5 Pro update is
5:02:13
absolutely insane. You can see it just got released a few hours ago. It's completely free to code with if you do
5:02:18
what I'm about to show you. And I literally spent like 5 minutes testing out this new update. You can see I built
5:02:23
AI powered keyword research tool, a CRM, and even a Roman marketplace simulator.
5:02:30
You can see right here, which we can play kind of like a game, and it was super easy. I literally just gave it like two prompts, one shot, boom. I'll
5:02:36
show you exactly how I built it. I'll show you exactly how to access all this for free and test it head-to-head against Claude spoiler. One of them was
5:02:44
not even close. And I'll show you exactly why that is in a minute. Plus, I'll walk you through setting it up with AI Studio, Visual Studio Code, and even
5:02:51
show you the new Bolt DIY integration that works basically perfectly. And if
5:02:56
you've been waiting for coding AI that actually delivers in one shot, one prompt, like you can see right here,
5:03:01
then this is it. And let me show you how to start building with AI in just a few
5:03:07
minutes. Let's go. Brand new update from Google Gemini 2.5 Pro as you can see
5:03:13
right here. I've been testing out today. Actually just created a full CRM like you can see and even a 3JS Roman
5:03:21
marketplace simulation which is pretty crazy. We can zoom in and zoom out of that right there. And it looks
5:03:26
absolutely banging to be honest with you. It looks really good. And so what we're going to be doing today is just
5:03:32
testing out, seeing how it works, seeing what we can build with it, and seeing how powerful. already just from the look
5:03:37
of feel from what I've built. I've literally just run these two tests in 5 minutes. It's absolutely rapid when it
5:03:43
comes back to you. And if you're wondering, okay, what does this mean? What's all the new differences, etc. So,
5:03:49
this is Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview. And basically what it's focused on is
5:03:56
even better coding performance. Now, I would already say that Gemini 2.5 Pro so
5:04:01
far has been goated in terms of performance, in terms of the outputs. It's getting better all the time and
5:04:08
this is just another massive upgrade. So, if you want to get access to this for free, you can go over to aistic
5:04:14
studio.google.com. Then you can select Gemini 2.5 Pro preview in the top right here and you
5:04:21
will see the May the 6 update right here. Okay, so this is available. It is
5:04:27
free to use. I've not got my credit card details plugged in here. I think it does have some limits, but you can use it for
5:04:32
free. And then if you have Gemini Advanced, you can also get access to this inside Gemini directly here and
5:04:37
then preview stuff in the canvas. Tends to look better to be honest with you, but it looks really cool either way. You can see basically in terms of the web
5:04:44
dev arena leaderboard, Gemini 2.5 Pro now ranks number one. And I would
5:04:50
honestly say they came out of nowhere this year. Like the tool was never that good. And then Gemini 2.5 Pro came out
5:04:57
and it was absolutely awesome. So you can see it's absolutely dominating the web dev arena leaderboard from my own
5:05:04
test. I would say it's definitely better than claw 3.7 Sonic. It's also a lot faster and it's awesome for building
5:05:09
stuff out. So you can also see for example here you can do some other cool stuff. So for example, you can actually
5:05:16
video to code now. So it's got this video understanding and then you can use that to generate code as well. It's
5:05:23
really easy to just code stuff out directly and we'll be testing this out in a second. All right. Now, if you want
5:05:30
to see what other people are building with it, here's some examples from the actual Google team. So, they said, "Here's what our team is building in
5:05:36
Canvas with Gemini 2.5 Pro, the new edition today." And you can see, for example, someone here created like a fun
5:05:43
sound guessing game. We've got another one where someone built out a whole website for a onehop app for looking
5:05:52
through books and stuff like that. Someone else built out this tool for mortgages and calculations and stuff.
5:05:59
And here's another one. This was a garden bed planner, which is pretty crazy. It actually looks really cool.
5:06:04
And additionally, we even have some games. So, for example, you see here, this is a game for learning like about
5:06:10
chemistry, molecules, and stuff like that. And additionally, we have the McBTH line rehearsal app. So, you can
5:06:17
build anything that you want. Any idea that you have, you can build. And it is absolutely amazing. For example, for
5:06:23
building out this CRM dashboard, here's how I did it. This is how easy. It's absolutely silly. So, if you want to go
5:06:28
and build stuff, you just go to new chat. Then you're going to select 2.5 Pro. You don't need any coding
5:06:33
experience now to build whatever you want. And you can see, for example, here what it said was build a CRM, right?
5:06:40
Very simple prompt, not like a particularly difficult prompt at all. Then I said yes, because it was asking
5:06:45
me some ideas and what we need to do, etc. And then from here, it was like, okay, great. Let's just go and build it
5:06:51
out. And it literally built this out. I asked it to build it into HTML and canvas. And then finally from there it
5:06:59
built something but it was not working when I was clicking through between these. So I actually said make sure that
5:07:04
I can click through the tabs when I'm using it. When I click each section nothing happens. Please fix it. Boom.
5:07:09
Shack lacker. That was fixed and corrected. Like you can see here's another example. So I said create a real
5:07:15
world simulation of a marketplace in Roman times in canvas. And it created something that was very basic. If we
5:07:20
actually open this up, you can see the previous generation. It's just like a flat sort of 2D simulator right here.
5:07:27
Then I said, "Okay, make the people more realistic and make it 3DS so I can see the whole thing and move around." And it
5:07:34
was like, "Yeah, no problem, mate." So it went off. It did that. And now you can see we can actually just use that
5:07:40
right here. And I think the more iterations you do inside 2.5 Pro, the more realistic you can make it look. But
5:07:45
you can see how cool that is. For example, if we said maybe we want to for example add more detail, right? You could say add more detail,
5:07:53
improve the market stalls, make it all feel more realistic, have
5:08:01
more detail to the people, etc. Right? And then if you want to share this stuff, you can actually click on share
5:08:07
over here. It will create a link for you. And this is just implemented on a subdomain inside gemini.google.com. So,
5:08:14
if we click on confirm a few, we have the marketplace ready to preview right here. Really easy and simple to do.
5:08:21
Super fast. Um, you know me, I've tested, for example, tools like Quen, Claude, and if it lets me down, I just
5:08:27
show you on the live stream, right? But this one was actually super powerful. So, let's try this. I'm just going to say add more detail, improve market
5:08:34
source, blah blah blah, and we'll see what we get back now and see if we can just take this to a whole new level. Now
5:08:40
again if you want to use it inside AI studio you can do exactly the same thing. It doesn't seem to have like a
5:08:45
canvas option. So you would have to for example just go inside the chat here use similar sort of prompts and then we can
5:08:52
say okay building 3JS and we'll just put just HTML
5:08:57
preview. Hit run and then we should be good to to go on that. So it tends to
5:09:04
take a little bit longer inside AR studio but you also get more control over it. So for example here you can
5:09:10
check the token count. You can check the temperature. You can also switch between like code
5:09:15
execution, function calling etc. You can even add Google search as well which is
5:09:21
pretty cool. And additionally you've got like some advanced settings on the right hand side as well in terms of like
5:09:27
output length and that sort of thing. Now if we go back we've got the Roman
5:09:32
marketplace with a bit more detail, more buildings etc. It's added more detail to
5:09:38
the marketplace stores. And if we look at the people, you can see they've just got a bit more detail to them. Now, if
5:09:44
we keep going and we keep iterating on that, eventually we'll get something that looks really good. But as a first
5:09:50
sort of what is this, a third draft, it's not bad at all. And it looks really cool.
5:09:58
You just build out your own games. If you spent a whole day on this, you could create something absolutely awesome to be fair. Someone asks, "What does
5:10:05
temperature do?" So the temperature inside AR studio will just make it more creative, right? So it's a creativity
5:10:10
allowed in the responses. If you increase the creativity, if you increase the temperature, then it will be more
5:10:15
creative in its outputs, but it's also more likely to break or to do something nonsensical as well. All right, so
5:10:21
that's coding this out. Now we've got that good to go. Let's have a look and we'll just run that on the preview. So
5:10:27
we're going to go to HTML code editor. Plug that in.
5:10:33
We'll have a look at liveweave.com. tends to be better for previewing code, especially if it's something like this.
5:10:40
And now we have the Roman market simulation like you can see. To be fair, I mean, I actually think the outputs
5:10:46
were better inside AI Studio than they are inside Gemini Advanced cuz that's added more
5:10:53
detail already. But yeah, you can see here the market stores, the people, etc. You could also animate that as well.
5:11:01
So you could go back inside Gemini AR Studio, make the design more interesting
5:11:08
and animated and lifelike, but I would say it's like the ultimate vibe coding tool right now because you can just keep
5:11:15
going back and forth with it. Very quick to make changes. Now the other thing is here as well is if we pull this up and
5:11:20
we compare it versus something like Claude. So let's do that. All right. And what we'll do is we'll just run exactly
5:11:26
the same thing on both at the same time, right? To try and make it fair. So, if we go back to a new chapter here, we've
5:11:33
got 2.5 Pro experimental and then we've got Claude, which I would say is the second best option, right? So, you got
5:11:39
two different options there. Again, this is for coding specifically like this is what Gemini is really good at. So, if we
5:11:45
go into for example here and we'll test which
5:11:50
one creates the best outputs. So, let's see what we got. Yeah, we can try with the simple 3D car simulator in 3GS.
5:11:59
So, let's plug that into Gemini and we'll plug it into Claude. I'm going to give Claude the head start. So, we'll
5:12:05
hit enter on Claude like and then we'll hit enter on Gemini and we'll see which one number one performs fastest and
5:12:12
which one gives us the best outputs as well. I just need to select canvas as well inside Gemini advanced.
5:12:17
Someone said compare it against Quen as well. Quen is just from what I've seen
5:12:23
so far is so bad at Alberts. So the other thing here as well is like by default claw doesn't have thinking
5:12:29
mode selected whereas Gemini 2.5 Pro you can see it automatically goes straight into thinking mode before it starts
5:12:36
coding anything out and you can see now it's coding out Claudius doing the same
5:12:42
thing and we'll see which one comes up with the best outputs. So you can see here
5:12:49
let's have a look. This is crazy. All right. So, they pretty much finished at the same time here. But what you can see
5:12:56
is it's come back to us with this blue screen, my friends. Imagine if I was
5:13:01
trying to do a tutorial on YouTube and I'm trying to show you some cool stuff that you can do with AI and then the
5:13:08
tool that I pay £150 a month for doesn't give me anything. But the tool that I've
5:13:14
got completely for free inside AI Studio works perfectly. That's a big difference
5:13:21
here. And look at this. We're zooming around. We're having the time of our lives driving this 3JS car and it is
5:13:28
working perfectly. Whereas, if you go over to Claude, nothing is happening, right? I'm pressing up and down. I'm
5:13:34
pressing the arrows, etc. It says speed is 100 km an hour, but I
5:13:41
can't see anything. And there's no preview here or anything, right? It's just it's absolutely that's what you get
5:13:46
back from Claude. So you can see the difference here. Exactly the same prompt, but Gemini just gives
5:13:54
us way better outputs, like 10 times better. And also, it's very easy to deploy this. We could add more detail to
5:14:01
it as well. We can zoom around the map and we can build out as much detail as
5:14:06
we want inside this project and then deploy it as well in a subdomain. but it's miles above the second best coding
5:14:12
tool in the world. And I think until Claude releases like version 4, it's
5:14:18
just not going to be able to compete. It's nowhere near the same level. Now, the other cool thing here as well is if
5:14:24
we go over to open router, so I've already shown you how to code and vibe code with it inside, for example. By the
5:14:30
way, this is the output. It looks better now. But yeah, so I've already shown you how to, for example, code inside Gemini
5:14:36
Advanced. I've shown you how to get free access to Gemini 2.5 Pro inside Google AI Studio.
5:14:44
And if we take that iteration of what we created previously, let's see what we got back here. Yeah, look at that. It's
5:14:50
just magical, isn't it? We got people floating around. We got people walking around the market store.
5:14:58
We created that in one shot and it was incredibly easy. Let's pull this up full
5:15:03
screen for you. Like this is I don't know if anyone here used to play Mega Drive back in the day or whatever. This
5:15:10
is probably better graphics than something like an old school Mega Drive. It's kind of like when the N64 came out.
5:15:15
So that's what we're looking at here, peeps. He's super powerful, easy to create stuff, easy to build stuff. You
5:15:22
don't even need to be a great prompter at this point, let alone need to code or understand what code is. It's incredibly
5:15:28
easy. Now if we go over to open router we can also select models over here and
5:15:33
we can start coding with the models for example if we go to this page
5:15:41
I think we should have I want to make sure have we got open
5:15:46
router on Google on have we got Google 2.5 pro experimental
5:15:53
on open router here we go all right by the way just make sure you filter to buy
5:15:58
newest. I think Open Marita has changed that recently. So, if we click on here, we have the April model, but I can't see
5:16:06
the latest model from Google. If we go on to the open router homepage here,
5:16:12
yeah, it doesn't seem to be available on Open Router yet. But what you can do is if you go over to AI Studio and then
5:16:19
inside here, you're going to get an API key, then create an API key. Once you've
5:16:25
done that, then you can go over to something called Visual Studio Code. I have the full recipe inside the AI
5:16:31
profit boardroom link in the comments description if you want like the instructions on how to set up. And then
5:16:36
from here, if we go over to client, then select Google Gemini.
5:16:43
Let's see if we've got this available to code with. Here we go. All right. Here's how to do it. Right. So if you go inside
5:16:50
clin and then using 2.5 pro,
5:16:55
it's upgraded right here. So all you need to do is use 0325 in client and
5:17:01
that automatically points to the newest version. So if we go to 325, let's do
5:17:06
that now. Client inside the inst extensions 325 is the one that you want
5:17:12
to select. Then you're going to plug in your API key that you got from AI Studio earlier. And then inside this section,
5:17:19
just make sure you do have pro experimental setup. And then inside here, if we X off here, we'll go back to
5:17:26
the AI profit boardroom. And we'll just grab a random prompt from here. So,
5:17:32
let's see what we can do here. Grab that. Now, inside the custom instructions, I'm
5:17:38
actually going to delete this stuff cuz I don't really use it that much. All right, let's hit save on that. And then
5:17:44
we're going to plug this in. And I'm going to say generate a high converting landing page for my SEO agency. Just see
5:17:50
what it pulls up. So this is using the latest version of Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. And
5:17:57
that was super easy to set up. And you can see here it actually gives you the API cost. So this is proof that you can
5:18:03
code with it using the API for free, right? It's not costing you anything to use this before I start getting YouTube
5:18:10
comments telling me it's not free. So it's created the HTML. Now it's creating the CSS. Let's see what else we can
5:18:17
build with in the meantime. So, I'm going to say let's have a look what we got here.
5:18:22
Really, you want to use it for coding. So, I'm just going to focus on coding related tools. Let's try a keyword
5:18:28
research tool over here. Let's go inside Gemini. Now, plug that in. Always select canvas
5:18:37
and then hit enter. What I'm going to do in the meantime is go back to AI Studio. We'll try and create something cool in
5:18:43
here. So you can code like three different projects here with Gemini, with AI Studio, and then also with
5:18:48
Visual Studio Code. And then whilst you're waiting for the code to generate, it's quite easy to flick between the tabs and just test different stuff out.
5:18:55
See what else what other cool stuff you can build. Right. So I'm going to say, okay, 3JS
5:19:00
SEO related game for my SEO agency
5:19:07
focused on building back links. Make it fun and interesting like a 3D
5:19:16
run a game for SEOs. Make the graphics awesome code in HTML.
5:19:23
Then if you press command and enter that will just run the prompt so you can get the outputs.
5:19:30
In the meantime, we've now got the tool back from
5:19:35
the AI powered research tool. So it's created a keyword research tool that we
5:19:41
can just plug in an API key and some ideas of like keywords we want to generate. Right? So for example, if we
5:19:46
put dogs inside the niche and then inside the API key, I'm just going to grab that from AI Studio in the
5:19:52
background. Basically like you can build your own custom tools. Now this is not guaranteed to work, right? Quite often
5:19:57
when you build these types of tools where you plug in your own API key, it can break, but let's see what we get
5:20:03
back. So I'm going to copy and then plug this in. Hit start keyword research. That's finding the keywords for us here.
5:20:11
And I'm going to say it's not using AI to generate this. I say don't use
5:20:16
presets. Get the AI/ API to generate keyword ideas
5:20:24
based on whatever niche I typed in. In the meantime, if go back to the chat now, that is already generated. It's
5:20:32
ridiculously fast. It's so fast. This is silly. Now, let's go back to
5:20:39
LiveWave and we'll test this out. We'll plug that bad boy in and we've created
5:20:44
the SEO runner game. So, you see here, for example, you have to get tools, you have to avoid the spam, you increasing
5:20:52
your DA, etc. And it works pretty nicely. All right, then we've got the penalty, and that messed us up. Now
5:20:59
again, if you want to improve this, just go back to your code here and just say, "Okay, make this more colorful, add much
5:21:08
more detail to the whole level." SLRunner,
5:21:15
make it feel more realistic. And I'm add a retro vibe
5:21:21
to it as well. Make the background
5:21:26
like an SEO traffic chart. And then we'll run that and we'll see what we get back in a sec. In the
5:21:32
meantime, this has come back to us with the new code. And we can just keep flicking between everything. So we can v
5:21:37
code like three things at the same time because we're waiting for all the different pieces to finish. Right? So if we hit start keyword research over here,
5:21:45
boom, look at that. So it's actually worked now. Again, we just put one prompt there. Then we went back. Always
5:21:51
just give it the feedback on exactly what you want or what the problem is. And then we've got the keywords ready to go right here. and it's generated that
5:21:58
using AI, right? You could also say, okay, like tailor the outputs more to the topic, right? So, what is dogs?
5:22:04
Obviously, not grammatically correct. And maybe some of these are like placeholder keywords as well. So, say
5:22:10
okay, make sure you avoid placeholder keywords.
5:22:18
Make sure the keywords are generated with AI. tailor
5:22:24
the keyword ideas specifically
5:22:29
to the topic I type in. Example,
5:22:34
doc, you come up with keyword ideas like
5:22:41
Google dog names using the AI and the API. Now, if we go back to
5:22:48
Visual Studio Code, that is finished. Now we can hit run command and load this up. And we've got the oneshot page right
5:22:56
here. There's parts of this that I just don't think that and I've always found this with Gemini particularly. I've
5:23:02
never found it with claude so much, but when you use the API directly inside Visual Studio Code, quite often the
5:23:09
outputs are not as nice as running it through the canvas inside Gemini. Right?
5:23:14
So that's just one thing to bear in mind, but you can see how you can code stuff for free and it's pretty easy and simple to use right there. Now we go
5:23:22
back to Gemini here. We've got the outputs again. This is the improved runner game.
5:23:29
We'll go back to live weave over here and test it. Right. So you can see here
5:23:34
now it's messed up the code a little bit and we can't see anything. We can't see any characters, etc. So if I was like
5:23:40
going back, I would just ask it to improve that. And you can see that it's not perfect. Right? We've tested it to the limits, which is what I wanted to
5:23:46
show you today. I don't want to show you like, oh, this is perfect if it's not. And you've got to see like the pros and
5:23:51
the cons of this, but essentially, you can see how this works step by step. And then, additionally, if we go back to
5:23:58
Gemini now, we've got the new version right here. So, let's plug in the API
5:24:03
key again, see what we get back. And then we got some keyword ideas there. I still think that could be improved a
5:24:09
lot. So, you can see the pros and the cons of this. like it can create the basics pretty quickly, but it does
5:24:16
mess up a little bit. I don't know why it's simulating. It should be using the actual API call. So, I'm going to say
5:24:22
make sure you do a live API call inside the tool, not a simulated one.
5:24:30
The other thing you can do here is if you go to NA10. So if we log into NA10 here, right, you
5:24:36
can actually build. I think I've actually cancelled my NA10 account, that's why. But you can actually build
5:24:42
for free using NA10 as well, just using the API from Google as well. So it's
5:24:48
quite easy to set up like agents. I've actually got some examples of how to do that inside the AI profit boardroom,
5:24:56
right? So, if you want to learn how to use this stuff, you can actually just type in NA10 here, and then you'll see
5:25:02
all my best workflows, including like how to use stuff like Google Gemma and Google Gemini 2.5 Pro for free inside
5:25:10
NA10 to build whatever you want. Like you can see right here, we've got the full details like so. Today, we've
5:25:15
covered all the ways that you can code with Gemini and what the tool does, how
5:25:21
powerful it is, and what it can create, right? And also the limitations of this, where it gets stuck, and where it messes up. So, you know, it's not perfect. I've
5:25:27
shown you what it can and can't do. And yeah, you get the point here. So, we've shown you Gemini. I've shown you AI
5:25:34
Studio. We've looked at N8. We've also looked, for example, at Visual Studio
5:25:39
Code. There's one more tool that I want to show you today, and that is Windsurf cuz I know you've probably heard the
5:25:46
news. I think Chat Chubet is buying them for $3 billion, something crazy like that, right? So, if you want to use
5:25:52
Windsurf, let me show you an example. Right. So, let's open up a new project
5:25:58
here. I'll close that one. Then, we can just open up a new folder and we'll
5:26:04
create a new one. We're going to open that up. I think they've just released actually. So, you can see it's
5:26:10
downloading the update in the top right here. They've actually just released Windserve version 8. And then you've got
5:26:17
these two options, right? So, you can use chat or you can use write. And then we're just going to restart this to update to the new version. By the way,
5:26:24
these are all the new features inside Windsurf 8 as you can see. So, these are the new changes. I think this literally
5:26:30
just came out. Yeah, May the 6th. So, it's a brand new update. And you can also see Gemini 2.5 Pro is available
5:26:37
down there. So, if we go to Windsurf now, click that.
5:26:44
Let's load this bad boy up. Windsurf is totally failing on me. All right. Great.
5:26:50
All right. At least you know then as well. Maybe you can't use like wind surf. I'm just being 100% transparent
5:26:55
with you and you can see what works and what doesn't work today as well. So,
5:27:00
thanks very much for watching. Some people are saying wind ser is more like wind crash. I would agree with you
5:27:07
today. It definitely let me down part of the game. Usually, it's pretty good.
5:27:12
Fair enough. They get purchased for 3 billion. You can't open it up. Doesn't make sense to me. So, thanks so much for
5:27:18
watching. If you want to get access to the AI profit boardroom with all my best workflows, templates, SPS, etc.,
5:27:24
including how to code with all of the tools I've shown you, feel free to get that inside the AI profit boardroom
5:27:30
inside the community as well. You can ask any questions you have. Also comes with weekly Q&A calls, and additionally
5:27:36
all my best courses, agents, workflows, templates, and daily updated SPS. We
5:27:42
update this bad boy every single day with new updates on all the latest stuff that's happening right now.
5:27:48
Additionally, if you want to get a free one-to-one SEO strategy session that shows you how
5:27:53
we take websites from zero to 145,000 visits month and generate hundreds of thousands of dollars on autopilot, feel
5:27:59
free to get that link in the comments description and we'll show you exactly how to increase your SEO traffic, get more leads, traffic, and sales for free
5:28:07
using SEO. One thing I want to try, I've totally forgotten about this, but I want to try it right now. So, let's give it a
5:28:13
whirl, and that is bolt DIY. So, I'm going to shut down Windsurf.
5:28:19
Shame on you, Windsurf. And then what we can do here is we'll grab the
5:28:24
instructions for setting this up like you can see right here. And then we're just going to get this set up on
5:28:30
terminal. All right. Once you got it set up, we can go to the local host. If you
5:28:35
ever had any problems setting up with the SAP or whatever or GitHub, whatever, just plug it into Claude. It will save
5:28:41
you a lot of time. It'll tell you exactly what the problem is. And then what you can do from here is we're going to select Google. And from here, we're
5:28:48
going to select, let's see what we got here, 2.5 Pro
5:28:53
Experimental. Or you could use preview. And then if you ever want to code with Pro,
5:29:00
you can just go inside here, select the model that you want. So this is a brand new model by the way. The it's created
5:29:06
May the 7th, right? So it's pro preview that you need to select. Then from here
5:29:12
we're just going to grab an API key from open router. So go to open router top right keys create key. Then we're going
5:29:20
to plug in the API key here. And then from here let's test coding. So we'll just say build just for the sake of time
5:29:26
build a simple SEO calculator. And there you go. All right. Super easy and simple to do. Paste in the article.
5:29:32
paste in the keyword works perfectly first time round. You can use bolt DIY
5:29:38
set it up locally code locally and to be honest actually works plus it's free whereas wind surf it let us down
5:29:45
directly on the video today. So, thanks very much for watching. That is basically how to use all of this stuff,
5:29:50
how to code with anything. We've talked through Bolt, Gemini, AI Studio. We've also talked through Windsor, Visual
5:29:56
Studio Code, and NA10 as well. If you want to get all my best recipes, templates, workflows, it's all inside
5:30:01
the air profit boardroom. We update the SAPs daily. We're adding new updates all the time. Plus, the community is
5:30:08
absolutely awesome. And if you join, you can actually become an affiliate if you want to make money that way as well. And
5:30:14
it's super simple and easy to get set up. So, thanks very much for watching and I'll see you on the next one.
5:30:20
Cheers.

Google Gemini full course. Today I'm going to show you the complete Google
0:05
Gemini system that can build entire apps, automate your business, and create content in minutes. This is the secret
0:12
weapon Google just dropped that nobody's talking about yet. You're going to learn how to build games, photo editors, AI
0:19
agents, and automated workflows without writing a single line of code. Plus, I'll reveal the hidden features that can
0:26
save you hundreds of hours every single week. This changes everything. New
0:31
Google Gemini Coder is insane and it's free. Today, I'm going to show you Google's new secret weapon that can code
0:38
entire games and apps for you in seconds. This thing just dropped and nobody's talking about it yet. I'm about
0:44
to blow your mind with what this can build. We're talking full tower defense games, physics simulations, and digital
0:51
art tools. All for free and all without writing a single line of code. This changes everything. So, Google just
0:57
dropped something massive. And I mean massive. They launched this new coding feature inside Gemini that most people
1:03
don't even know exists yet. And when I tested it, my jaw hit the floor. I'm talking about Google Gemini Canvas. This
1:10
isn't just another chatbot that spits out code. This thing actually builds working apps and games right in front of
1:15
your eyes. No coding skills needed, no complicated setup, just pure magic. Now, here's what blew my mind. I asked it to
1:22
build three different projects. a digital art canvas, a physics simulation, and a tower defense game.
1:29
All things that would normally take weeks to code. And this thing delivered in minutes. But before I show you
1:34
exactly what happened, let me explain what Google Gemini canvas actually is. Because this is bigger than most people
1:39
realize. Gemini canvas is Google's answer to everyone who said, "A I can't code properly." It's built right into
1:45
their Gemini platform. And it comes in three flavors for students, for work, and for fun. The student version helps
1:51
you learn. It creates custom quizzes from your study materials, visualizes code so you can understand it better,
1:58
and even refineses your drafts all automatically. The work version is where things get serious. It helps you
2:04
accelerate impact at your company, optimize operations, and drive growth with real-time tools. We're talking
2:10
interactive price sliders and custom proposals at close deals. But the fun version, that's where the magic happens.
2:16
This thing can generate 3D planets with unique details. Create sound memory games. Build music synthesizers with
2:23
full controls and even solve complex pathfinding problems. All with just simple text commands. Now, let me walk
2:29
you through my real tests. Because what I discovered will change how you think about coding forever. Test number one, I
2:35
asked it to create a virtual synthesizer. I wanted knobs and sliders for volume, pitch, reverb, and delay.
2:42
the ability to compose short melodies directly and options to record and play back within minutes. I had the Gemini
2:49
synthesizer with the tagline craft your melodies with sound. This wasn't some basic toy. This was a professional
2:55
looking music tool with a full piano keyboard, control knobs for volume, octave, reverb, and delay mix. Even
3:02
delay time controls. The interface was sleek, dark theme, responsive keys, record play, and clear buttons that
3:08
actually worked. This is the kind of tool musicians pay hundreds for. and Gemini built it for free. Test number
3:14
two, I asked for a digital art canvas, different brush types, color palettes, layer support, pixel art capability,
3:20
preset templates, export features. What I got blew my mind. A full digital art
3:26
studio that rivals Photoshop for basic tasks, complete tool palette on the left, color picker, size sliders,
3:33
opacity controls, a pixel grid option for pixel art, professional layers panel on the right. But here's the crazy part.
3:38
It included preset templates, standard 1,920x 1080, portrait mode, square format, even
3:46
64x 64 pixel art mode, plus customsiz inputs for any dimensions you want. This
3:52
looked like software you'd pay $50 a month for professional interface, clean design, all the features you'd expect.
3:58
Test number three, physics simulation. I wanted gravity effects on different objects, user controls for gravity
4:03
strength, object mass, initial velocity, real-time bouncing, and falling. Gemini delivered an interactive gravity
4:10
simulation with crystal clear instructions, sliders for gravity strength, object mass, X and Y velocity,
4:16
and bounciness. Add object and clear all buttons. The 3D objects looked
4:21
realistic. Pink spheres that actually bounced according to physics laws. You could adjust gravity from moonlight to
4:28
Jupiter-like. Change mass to see how heavy objects behave differently. Set initial velocity to launch objects
4:34
across the screen. The physics felt right. The controls were intuitive and it handled multiple objects interacting
4:40
realistically. Test number four. This is where things got absolutely insane. I asked for a tower defense game. Five tower types,
4:47
multiple enemy waves, currency system, increasing difficulty. What I got was neon nexus tower defense with full
4:54
cyberpunk theming, not some basic game. A professional quality tower defense with neon graphics and slick UI. Five
5:02
unique towers with distinct roles. Gatling gun for $100. Fast firing, low
5:07
damage. Cannon for 250. Slow, high area damage. Frost tower for 150. Slows
5:13
enemies in range. Missile silo for 400. Longrange seek strongest foe. Laser beamer for 600. Melts a single target.
5:20
The game map had a clear enemy path. Currency tracking, health system, wave counter, professional game UI that you'd
5:27
see in Steam games. The strategic depth was real cheap fast towers versus expensive heavy hitters. area damage
5:34
versus single target, slowing effects versus direct damage. This had real game balance and the visual style, pure
5:41
cyberpunk neon aesthetic. This looked like an indie game you'd buy for $10. All of these built-in minutes. No coding
5:48
knowledge required. No expensive software, just simple text prompts. But here's where this gets interesting for
5:53
your business, because this isn't just about games and fun projects. Think about what this means for your company.
5:59
Need a custom calculator for your website? Gemini can build it. Want an interactive product demo? Done. Need a
6:06
data visualization tool? Easy. The applications are endless. Custom forms.
6:14
Interactive pricing tools, product configurators, lead magnets, sales demos, training simulations, onboarding
6:20
tools, all without hiring developers, all without learning to code. All for free. Now, let me show you the three
6:26
different versions and how to access them. First, the student version. This is perfect if you're learning or
6:31
teaching. Go to Gemini and click on for students. You'll see options like personalized learning where you can
6:37
upload study guides and it creates custom quizzes. There's visualize code
6:42
which breaks down complex programming concepts into simple visual explanations and refined drafts which helps improve
6:49
your writing and assignments. The work version is under for work. This is where businesses get serious value. Accelerate
6:55
impact helps you build tools that make immediate business impact. Optimize operations creates efficiency tools and
7:03
drive growth builds sales and marketing tools. But the fun version under for fun is where the creative magic happens. 3D
7:10
planet generator creates unique worlds. Sound memory game builds interactive games. Music synthesizer creates full
7:16
music production tools. And BFS Pathfinder solves complex routing problems. Here's what most people don't
7:22
understand. This isn't just about the tools Gemini provides. It's about what you can build yourself. See, each of
7:28
these examples shows you what's possible. But you can ask Gemini to build anything. Custom e-commerce tools,
7:34
booking systems, inventory management, customer service portals, marketing automation tools. The limit is your
7:40
imagination. Now, let me give you the inside secrets to getting the best results from Gemini Canvas. First, be
7:47
specific about what you want. Don't just say, "Build me a game." Say, "Build me a tower defense game with five tower
7:53
types, multiple enemy waves, and a currency system for upgrades." Second,
7:59
describe the user experience. How should it look? How should it feel? What should happen when users click buttons? Third,
8:05
mention key features you need, export options, save functionality, different modes, customization options. Fourth,
8:12
ask for responsive design. Make sure it works on mobile and desktop. Fifth, request clean, modern styling. Gemini
8:19
can make things look professional if you ask. But here's the real secret. You can iterate and improve. If the first
8:26
version isn't perfect, tell Gemini what to change. Add features, fix bugs,
8:34
improve the design. It learns and adapts. This is like having a full development
8:40
team at your fingertips for free. Now, I know what you're thinking, Julian. This
8:45
sounds too good to be true. What's the catch? Honestly, there isn't one. Google is giving this away for free because
8:52
they want to compete with OpenAI and Claude. They're in an AI arms race and we benefit. The only limitation is
8:58
complexity. Super advanced applications might need real developers, but for 80%
9:03
of what most businesses need, Gemini handles it perfectly. And here's what excites me most. This is just the
9:10
beginning. Google is updating Gemini constantly, adding new features, improving capabilities, making it
9:17
smarter. 6 months from now, this thing will be even more powerful. A year from now, it might replace entire development
9:23
teams for small to medium projects. But you can get ahead of the curve right now. While your competitors are still
9:29
hiring expensive developers and waiting months for projects, you can build and test ideas in minutes. This is your
9:34
competitive advantage. Use it now. Before I wrap up, let me give you the practical steps to start using this
9:40
today. Step one, go to gemini.google.com.
9:46
Sign in with your Google account. Step two, choose your version. Students, work or fun. Each has
9:53
different tools and examples. Step three, start with the examples. Try the 3D planet generator. Test the music
10:00
synthesizer. Play with the tools Google provides. Step four, reverse engineer what you see. Look at how these tools
10:06
work. what features they have, how the interface is designed. Step five, start building your own projects. Begin
10:12
simple. A calculator, a quiz tool, a basic game, then get more complex. Step six, iterate and improve. Don't expect
10:20
perfection on the first try. Refine your requests, add features, fix issues. Step seven, deploy and test. Get real users
10:27
to try your creations, gather feedback, make improvements. This process will teach you how to think like a prompt
10:33
engineer, how to communicate with AI effectively, how to build things without coding, and these skills are becoming
10:39
more valuable every day. Look, I've been in the SEO and digital marketing space for years. I've built a sevenf figureure
10:45
agency, trained over 50,000 students, written bestselling books on SEO and agency marketing, and I can tell you
10:51
with confidence, this changes everything. The barriers to building digital products just disappeared. The
10:57
cost of testing ideas dropped to zero. The speed of innovation increased by 100 times. Smart entrepreneurs will use this
11:04
to build businesses, create products, test markets, generate revenue. While others are still trying to learn to
11:10
code, you'll be building and shipping. This is your moment. Don't waste it. Julian Goldie reads every comment. So,

11:59
The question isn't whether AI will change your industry. It's whether you'll be ahead of the curve or left behind. Choose wisely. New Google Gemini
12:08
update. Google just added AI note taking to Google Meet. This is going to save you hours every single week. No more
12:14
juggling notes, presenting slides, and managing chat all at the same time. Your AI assistant literally sits in your
12:20
meetings and does all the documentation work for you. Picture this. You're running a client presentation. You're
12:26
trying to present your slides, answer questions in the chat, watch people's reactions, and somehow take notes about
12:32
what's being discussed. It's impossible to do all of that well. You either miss important details or you can't focus on
12:39
actually leading the meeting. That's exactly why Google built this feature. They realize that meeting hosts are
12:45
drowning in multitasking. So now Gemini handles the notes automatically while you focus on what actually matters.
12:52
Presenting, engaging, and making decisions. This thing uses Gemini AI to
12:58
automatically capture everything that happens in your meetings. Key decisions, action items, who said
13:04
what, when they said it. It's like having a personal assistant in every single meeting you attend. Let me break
13:10
down exactly what this does and why you need to start using it today. When you turn on take notes for me, Gemini AI
13:16
starts listening to your entire meeting. It's not just recording audio. It's actually understanding what's being said
13:22
and pulling out the important stuff. So, while you're focused on the conversation, the AI is building a
13:28
complete summary of your meeting in real time. The moment your meeting ends, the AI automatically saves a complete
13:35
summary to the meeting organizers Google Drive. not just random notes, a structured document that shows you
13:41
exactly what was discussed, what decisions were made, and what everyone needs to do next. And here's the crazy
13:47
part, it even creates a section called suggested next steps where it automatically identifies all the action
13:53
items and follow-ups from your meeting. Now, if you want to take your business automation to the next level, you should
13:58
definitely check out my AI profit boardroom. This is where over 1,000 entrepreneurs are learning to scale
14:04
their businesses and save hundreds of hours with AI automation. I share advanced strategies that go way beyond
14:10
basic tools like this Google Meet feature. But let's get back to this because there's so much more you need to know. What's really cool is how this
14:16
works during the actual meeting. You're looking at your regular Google Meet screen with all the participants, but
14:22
there's this live notes panel on the side. You can literally watch the AI capturing key points as people speak. It
14:28
shows real-time updates like updated 4 minutes ago. So, you know, it's actively listening and processing. If someone
14:34
joins late, they can immediately see the summary. so far and get caught up on what they missed. No more awkward can
14:40
someone fill me in moments. The AI has already done that work for them. And here's something most people don't
14:46
realize. Everyone in the meeting can see the blue pencil icon and click on it to view the notes being taken. But who can
14:52
start or stop the note takingaking depends on your meeting settings. By default, the meeting organizer and
14:57
internal participants can control it. However, if host management is enabled, only the meeting organizer, hosts, and
15:03
co-hosts can start or stop notes. So you have control over the documentation while keeping everything visible to
15:09
participants. And if you're taking notes and have transcription turned on, the AI notes will actually link to specific
15:15
parts of the meeting transcript. So if someone mentioned an important detail, you can click right to that exact moment
15:22
in the written transcript to see the verbatim quotes. In Google's demo, you can see clickable timestamps throughout
15:28
the notes that jump directly to those points in the transcript. No more searching through pages of transcript text trying to find one comment. Now,
15:35
here's what really blew my mind. This isn't just for English anymore. They just added support for French, German,
15:40
Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish. So, if you're running a global business or working with
15:45
international teams, this thing can handle multiple languages, though it can only do one language per meeting right
15:51
now. Now, I need to be totally honest about the requirements. This feature is available with Google Workspace Business
15:57
Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise Standard, and Enterprise Plus plans. So, you do need a paid Google Workspace
16:04
subscription. Also, your admin needs to enable this feature for your organization. Let me show you exactly
16:10
what this looks like. First, if you're an admin, you just go to your Google Workspace settings, find Gemini
16:16
settings, and check the box that says, "Let people use Google AI note-taking and meetings." That's it for setup. Now,
16:22
let me tell you why this is such a big deal for business owners and entrepreneurs. Think about the last important meeting you ran. You were
16:29
probably trying to present your ideas, manage the discussion, watch people's body language, answer questions, and
16:35
somehow capture all the important points at the same time. It's mentally exhausting. This AI feature completely
16:42
eliminates that problem. You can give 100% of your attention to leading the meeting because you know every single
16:48
detail is being captured automatically. No more mental juggling act. No more choosing between being present and
16:54
documenting everything. Plus, think about accountability. When the AI automatically captures action items and
17:00
assigns them to specific people, there's no more confusion about who's supposed to do what. Everyone gets a clear list
17:06
of their responsibilities, this alone will probably save you hours of follow-up emails and check-ins. And
17:11
here's something most people don't think about. These AI generated notes become a searchable database of all your
17:16
meetings. So, 6 months from now, when you're trying to remember what was decided in that strategy meeting, you
17:22
can just search your Google Drive and find exactly what you need. The accuracy on this thing is honestly impressive.
17:28
It's not perfect, but it's way better than most people's handwritten notes. The AI understands context, so it knows
17:33
the difference between important decisions and casual conversation. It focuses on the stuff that actually
17:39
matters. One thing that's really cool is how this integrates with the rest of Google Workspace. The meeting notes
17:44
automatically show up in your Google Drive. They're attached to your calendar events and they're searchable across
17:50
your entire workspace. This means you can actually use Google search to find specific meetings or decisions from
17:56
months ago. Just type in a few keywords and boom, you'll find exactly what you're looking for. This turns your
18:02
meeting history into a powerful business intelligence tool. The suggested next steps feature is particularly powerful
18:08
for project management. Instead of having action items scattered across different apps and platforms, everything
18:13
is captured in one place. You can even assign tasks directly from the Google Doc if you're using Google's task
18:19
management features. For agencies and service businesses, this is especially valuable because you can share these
18:24
detailed meeting notes with clients. It shows professionalism and ensures everyone is on the same page about
18:30
project scope and deliverables. No more he said, she said situations. What I love about this Google Meet
18:37
feature is that it's not trying to replace human intelligence. It's augmenting it. You're still the one
18:42
making decisions and having conversations. The AI is just handling the busy work of capturing and
18:48
organizing everything. And unlike some AI tools that require a steep learning curve, this one is incredibly simple to
18:54
use. You literally just click a button and it works. There's no complex setup or configuration required. The cost
19:00
savings alone make this worth using if you're already on a business plan. Think
19:05
about how much time you spend taking meeting notes or how much you pay someone to do it. This AI does it better
19:11
and faster than any human could. Plus, the notes are more objective than human notes. We all have biases and tend to
19:17
focus on different things. The AI captures everything equally so you get a more complete picture of what actually
19:23
happened in the meeting. I predict that within the next year, this kind of AI note-taking will become standard in
19:28
every business meeting. The companies that adopt it early will have a significant advantage in terms of
19:34
productivity and organization. If you want to stay ahead of these AI trends and learn how to implement them in your
19:40
business, you need to be part of a community that's sharing the latest strategies. That's exactly what we do in
19:45
the AI profit boardroom. We have over 1,000 members who are already using these tools to scale their businesses
19:52
and save hundreds of hours with AI automation. And if you're serious about growing your business with AI and SEO,
19:58
you should book a free SEO strategy session with my team. We'll show you exactly how to use AI tools like this
20:04
Google Meet feature as part of a comprehensive growth strategy. You can find the link in the comments and
20:10
description. The bottom line is this. Google just handed you an AI assistant for all your meetings. If you're already
20:17
on a Google Workspace business plan, it's included. It's incredibly easy to use and it can save you hours every
20:23
single week. There's literally no reason not to start using this today. In the AI
20:28
Money Lab, we have an SOP and process for implementing this and tons of other AI tools. You'll get access to over 100
20:35
different tutorials and use cases, plus a community of 19,000 members who are
20:40
all sharing their AI automation strategies. The value we provide there is insane, and you can see exactly what
20:47
you get with our checklist of tutorials that we give away as freebies every single day. Julian Goldie reads every
20:53

21:06
while other business owners are still taking notes by hand, you'll be using AI to capture everything automatically.
21:12
That's the kind of competitive advantage that separates successful entrepreneurs from everyone else. The future of
21:18
business is AI powered and it's happening right now. Don't get left behind.
21:23
Today, I'm going to show you a brand new Google AI agent that I built which can
21:29
essentially create avatar images like you can see right here. So, this is my avatar picture of me with open eyes
21:36
crispy crisp. So I actually created a video out of it as well. I'll show you how to automate that in a second. Well, I'm giving the full workflow away for
21:42
free. So you get the templates as well today. We play this avatar video for example and you can see what it looks
21:47
like. I can't believe I found these open AI crispy crisps. They're my absolute favorite.
21:54
Play that back in one X speed. I can't believe I found these Open AI crispy
22:00
crisps. They look delicious, by the way, don't they? Those crisps. They're my absolute favorite. I can't believe.
22:08
Now, if you want to automate this, basically, you see how I've done it. So, essentially what we're doing here is we have this NA10 automation where
22:15
eventually on the outputs here, we get the avatar image that looks like this using OpenAI's crispy crisp. So, you can
22:23
change this to whatever, you know, automation or you're trying to create, but basically, it's going to take a form and then plug it through this workflow.
22:29
I'll show you how that works in a second. And then additionally what you can actually do is take the image output from here. So this is an image generator
22:36
using Google's new nano banana and then from here we can get an output like video here using this workflow to
22:44
automate the video as well. And so we've got an AI image generator
22:52
and then we have another agent that takes that image generated by and plugs
22:57
it for a new workflow where we can automatically create a video as well.
23:03
And again, if you want to get all of this stuff for free, you can get it inside the AI money lab link in the
23:08
comments description. Go to the classroom, then go down to free MA10 automation templates and boom shack
23:15
lacker. I've given you both resources today so you can import workflows into NA10 if you want to get access. Right?
23:21
So, let me show you how this works. Essentially, what we've got here is an on form submission. Um, and that's going
23:27
to turn whatever products you come up with into an ad. Right now, can do this
23:33
in two ways. When you're when you're running this, let me show you an example what we did previously on the executions
23:39
here. So, if you want to see previous examples build, let's take a look at this one. All right. So when we uploaded
23:45
this for example, this was actually a thumbnail you can see here. So this is a
23:51
picture of me where I've uploaded the image into the workflow and then on the
23:56
outputs here we've generated this uh avatar video of meatizing kind of
24:04
like a PC ads. Essentially what I did here is I went on
24:10
to form submissions execute workflow over here. That's going to pop up a form and then we're going to plug in the
24:16
image that we want to use. So let me just take here see what we got. All right. So let's say for example we had
24:23
an image like this one here. Well we could upload that into our NHM workflow
24:29
and then use that to generate the avatar or video. Now the other way that you can do it is you can go on to like Gemini or
24:36
you can product image that you already have and then plug it through this workflow too. So for example, if we
24:42
switch to images over here and let's say for example, we wanted to come up with a
24:47
male model that we could use inside. So we could say rap male model
24:53
for an advert or female whatever and then go from here. Professor DY says for important
25:01
steps, can you state it again? Yeah, let me know which steps you need me to to show you. But essentially, you know, in
25:07
this process that we're using right here. So, we've got the mail model generated using Nana Banana. You know,
25:12
we're on step one. So, you haven't missed anything. We're running through this from literally from the start,
25:17
right? And then if we go back to our form, let's pull this up. So, this is the UGC ad generator. We're going to
25:24
take that image that we just downloaded. And then here, you would just tell it what you want, right? So, for example,
25:29
let's say it was a man advertising skincare product, something like that, right? So you can just type in skincare
25:35
products here and then you can see that's now generating with Google Drive. So it's going to upload to Google Drive.
25:41
It's going to analyze the image, right? So it's actually going to use chat for row to analyze the image. And basically
25:47
that's going to return the character name and everything like that. From here we've got an image prompt generator. Then we're going to send that over to
25:54
open router to generate the image. Right? And that's actually running it through open router to generate the
26:00
image with nana banana. And whilst we're waiting for that, Professor Dy says,
26:06
"Thank you so much. What's the big picture of what we're doing here? Also, last name rhymes. Really perfect. Thanks so much." Yeah. So the the big picture
26:13
here is you can automate ads in one click using avatars and Google, right?
26:19
And so if you want to automate image ads, you can. If you want to automate banners for social media, you could, right? If you want to automate creatives
26:25
for any social media platform, you can. Now, if you want to automate video ads or any type of video, then you can do
26:32
that using this process. And uh that's the big picture essentially. So, it's going to save you time. It's going to
26:38
save you money hiring models, photographers, and that sort of thing. And then also, it's going to create
26:44
something that's basically production level quality without having to go into a studio. So, if we go over here, let's
26:50
see what you never know what's going to come out here, but let's have a look and see what we got.
26:56
So now we have the image of the guy on the output. And if we go back here on
27:02
the form submission, what I'm actually going to do here is I want to change this now. So I'm going to open this up.
27:08
I'm going to rerun this and I'm going to say image description
27:13
and then we'll run through the steps in a minute. But I basically just want to show you how this works. All right. So whilst that's running, let me show you
27:19
how this works step by step. So essentially here we've got the number one which is a trigger work light right
27:24
to set this up you just need to set up a form submission trigger now you see we've got the authentication as none UGC
27:31
add generator form description generate UGC ad from image description then image
27:36
description is text element type right and so we're using that to generate the
27:42
uh the uploader file and then from then that's actually going to upload to Google Drive so that's the next step in
27:47
the process now I'll be using my Google drive credentials to log in. Here we're using file upload as the operation image
27:56
and that's going to go to my drive and image. All right. So it's going to take the image that we've uploaded here
28:04
and then we can upload that and then send this over here. All right. So once
28:11
you've uploaded the image and sent it to Google Drive then it's going to analyze
28:16
image over here. All right. So in the analyze image section we can now use
28:21
that to start generating our outputs. Okay. Now in the meantime before we go
28:28
into that let me show you this as well. So here's the other way you can use this. So if we execute this step we can
28:34
also describe like what we want to do using another image. So that's analyzing the image. Now basically that's going to
28:40
analyze the image and just basically tell us like what's in this image. analys if it primarily uh runs etc. And then
28:49
from here we've got the image from generator right so inside that image from generator it's going to say your
28:55
task create an image guided by system guidelines and then it's going to take that image that we created earlier and
29:02
just basically describe it. All right. Now, if you're wondering, okay, what are the system instructions here? So, for
29:07
the system message, we've got the role AI prompt builder purpose. Given an image, urf info, write one short natural
29:15
description for an AI image video generator to use in this app. Uh, if it's vague, place a product with a
29:21
person in a fitting everyday setting. Style not given, use casual realism,
29:27
blah blah blah. And then you got all the information here, right? Basically, what we're trying to do here is create
29:33
something where we actually vary the gender and everything else and the age each time. And then we use this to
29:39
generate ads for our product. So from here, that's going to create an image prompt. So for example, it's
29:46
created the prompt of young man, black skin, dark brown hair, wearing a black. And that's going to send over here.
29:53
And this is using a structured output passer, right? You can see it's actually taking the image prompt from the output
30:00
and structuring that so that we can send it to our next type of workflow which is over here. So if we have a look at these
30:05
previous executions that we ran for example like this one. Let me show you what we uploaded originally. So we
30:12
uploaded this image right here and
30:18
for the form description. You can see the details over here. plugged it in
30:24
that analyze that uploaded the file to Google Drive. You can see then we
30:29
analyze the image and there we go. All right. Some people asking like is this an MCP? It's not an
30:36
MCP. It's just creating images based on other images, right? So that's basically how the agent works is it takes that
30:42
image original and then plugs it through this workload to create something better. So we can see an example here.
30:48
We're running it through OpenAI. Once we've done that, it's going to
30:54
generate the image prompt. So you see here it says a joyful young man with short dark brown hair wearing a
31:02
bright red t-shirt blah blah blah and it uses that to create the image and then
31:08
it's going to send it over to open router to create the image. Right? So we're using chat completions
31:14
over router account sending headers using the fields below. the content type and application JSON. And then inside
31:21
the JSON, you can see what we're using here to generate the image. Right now,
31:26
we're using Google AI Studio and the latest version of Google, which is Nano Banana. Nano Banana literally just came
31:33
out, so it's brand new update, but it does help a lot generate better quality images. And then from here, we can just
31:39
edit the fields, right? So inside this edit field section,
31:45
this basically takes the data, the base, etc. and runs that through the workflow.
31:52
Now once that's done, if there's an error, it's going to send it over here.
31:57
And if it's worked, so you can see true or false, right? If it's false, then it sends it through the form and then
32:03
linked background to upload to Google Drive. If it actually works, then it will convert it to a file file, right?
32:09
It's taking the string and then turning it into a file. So that's basically how it works step by step throughout the
32:15
whole process. Pretty simple and easy. But if you don't want to set this up yourself, then just get the JSON file
32:22
from me, right? And so you see here we have the form submission. That's step number one. We upload the file to Google
32:27
Drive. Number two. Step number three, we analyze the image, create a prompt from
32:33
that image, send it over to Nano Banana, generate
32:38
the image, and convert it to a file. That's basically how it works step by step. This is another example of an
32:46
image we generated as well using this process. You can see here essentially we've got an alien eating crisps like
32:52
you can see that uploads into Google Drive. We generate PR blah blah blah. Pretty
32:58
simple. And then you can just change the prompt to generate whatever sort of character
33:05
you want as well. So that's it for step number one.
33:11
That is the AI ads generator when it comes to images. And then from here, what you can actually do is run this
33:16
through this workflow like you can see to generate any sort of videos you want. So we'll come on to that in a second.
33:23
And essentially what we've got over here is the next part of the workflow. So this is for generating videos, right? So
33:29
for example here, this video was generated using the same process and
33:35
it's really simple and easy to do. So let me show you how this works step by step. So essentially here if you want to
33:41
create a video like this, what you can do is you can take the image that you want to create a video about and run
33:47
this workflow. Okay? And what this is going to do is if we click
33:54
on execute workflow here, it's another trigger. So we just upload the brand asset and the campaign brief of whatever
34:00
we want to show. So let's say for example we have an alien, right? So
34:07
we're going to upload that alien and then inside here we're going to say okay alien
34:13
talking about his life on his spaceship.
34:18
All right, we're going to hit submit like so. You can change the mood as well if you want to. And what this is going
34:25
to do is again it's going to upload the file to Google Drive. Then it's going to use our brand strategy agent to come up
34:31
with some ideas and a creative director as well to help with that script and the
34:36
generation. Once that's done, we're then going to have a production specialist who actually comes up with the script
34:42
and everything else, which I'll show you in a second. And then this is going to send it over to FA. Now FA, if you've
34:47
never been on there before, basically is a website where you can generate videos automatically using the APIs, right? So
34:53
you have all these different APIs directly in the explore section like you can see you know you can use 11 labs
34:59
basically it's it's kind of like over router for media which means that it can generate uh media pretty quickly and
35:06
easily using this process up here and so if we look through the list here you can
35:12
see all these different media that you can use but the one that you want to use if you're using image to video is you
35:17
want to use B3 and then just make sure that you select image to video. Now, the best is
35:24
actually fast image to video because it'll be cheaper and faster for you. Right now,
35:29
once that's done, it's then going to wait before it
35:35
actually generates the video. Right? Because it's going to take a couple of minutes for the AI to generate the video. They are free, which means that
35:42
we have to wait a couple of minutes before we can download the brand video set. Right? So you can see here how it's
35:48
been running for 2 minutes because we're waiting for this to finish running, right? And so this is set up to wait for
35:55
2 minutes and you can see we're on 1 minute 30 here, right? So it's not going
36:02
to run the rest of the workflow until this waiting bit has finished. So basically you can send an image over
36:09
here, create an ad automatically, wait for V3 to generate, go off and do some
36:15
work or whatever, come back in a couple of minutes and make it will download the brand video and actually archive it and
36:23
upload it to Google Drive once that's done. So you can see that's now generated like
36:30
so. And if we go to download bland video, we have the output here. Another
36:36
day. And this is the alien that we've generated here, right? So, let's play
36:42
this. Another day. Another. You know, Earthlings and their selfies. Quite the odd ritual, don't you think? Still,
36:48
there's a certain charm to their quirks. So that alien was generated from this
36:53
work and we literally just uploaded the image
37:00
and then it created a full video then generated the step by step that
37:07
didn't work here is the data I wouldn't even worry you what you can actually do
37:14
is if you want to take this like so just grab
37:21
here and then let's see if that works. So for the Google Drive bit, you
37:26
actually don't. But yeah, you can see how this works by step. Now some people asking okay like
37:35
why use Google Drive, why checkp for etc. N workflow is I'm not going to be
37:41
SEO should use Google Drive or you should use box or anything like that. whatever applications you right. So my
37:49
goal with these workbooks to give you something that just basically steal from me and then if you want to adapt that
37:57
change it to whatever apps you prefer then feel free that's exactly how it works.
38:04
So if you want to know okay how do you build this we have the trigger here of brand asset in do that what you do is
38:12
you just add a new module inside here and you would add trigger right so you
38:20
add node form form triggers new event and that's how you
38:28
add this mod and again you can see the settings inside here so you can see authentication form title
38:37
Professor Dy says, "You are truly a business leader. Appreciate you." And then you got the form title here. So you
38:43
can change the name of the form if you want to brand assets. Okay.
38:49
So let's try another one now just while I'm explaining it just to make it a fun. And so for example here, this kind of
38:55
looks like a watch advert to be honest. So I'm going to take this over here.
39:00
Excit workflow. I'm going to take im We just generated again you can
39:06
automatically create this using the process I've just showed before. Then from here inside the campaign brief we
39:12
can say okay man advertising brand
39:20
called watch legends
39:29
or you like action movie car
39:34
and then you can add inside the mood here as ship. Then we're going to hit submit.
39:40
Like so. The main thing to show you here is that when you're running this, you can be very very flexible in terms of
39:47
the outputs you want. Right? So, this works for pretty much any brand, product, any different situation that
39:52
you want to generate a video for. You can create multiple videos and stitch them as well. And because you're
39:59
inserting an image here, you're going to have character consistency each time you run the work. Because if you loop it
40:06
again or if you generate multiple outputs with video, then you character consistency. Why? Because you're
40:12
starting off the same. So whilst that's waiting load, if we go
40:18
back to brand asset input details and then store brand asset.
40:25
taking that image. We're going to store it Google Drive file upload brand asset
40:31
take the file name etc. Then my drive this is where I'm store right but you can store it anywhere you want. Now the
40:37
other thing I want to note here as well is like if you need help with this sort of stuff and join the AI profit boardroom inside the AI profit boardroom
40:46
we actually do weekly coaching master classes on N10. We have a full course on
40:51
how to use N10 in the N workflow section here and then also inside community mask
40:57
for any help or support you can also DM me direct message me help as well so
41:03
it's the best place get there professor DY says I'm in just joined appreciate you joining if you're wondering okay
41:09
where do you start once you joined start right here on the start here post introduce yourself if you're starting
41:16
from scratch you can start with the six week master class if you're feeling overwhelmed We actually have our overall
41:21
protocol here so that you can save time as they won't.
41:26
This document right here shows you exactly how to avoid even over.
41:32
So feel free to join that. We have five weeks. So you can jump on coaching calls, ask any questions you have, get
41:38
help and support.
41:44
So then from here you can see this brand strategy agent. So we're taking all the inputs from drive and then we're using
41:51
this to create the visual elements, the personality, even the storytelling campaign
41:59
as well. And so with this process here, what we've designed is a work where we
42:07
can take that image, get the AI to analyze it based on our brief and then step by step just create every single
42:13
part. Now from here what we can also do is we've got the
42:20
create and we have this. So let me show you step by step
42:26
how that works. So when it comes to this process here we have the create director
42:35
and basically with this we're analyzing the brand visual elements personality etc and using that to generate like a
42:42
UGC style right so UGC is usually very authentic it works really well with AI
42:48
as well because it's very convincing and that creates a great ad and then we've got the AI specialist here with the AI
42:55
production specialist what we're essentially doing is using this whole process here to just create some impress
43:02
and then we're going to generate brand you know use V is that API that we use generate
43:09
videos using B3 and it's it's the best way I've seen generate
43:15
now if you want to see more examples of how I've generated this as well you can see some examples here so for example
43:21
this was a Stormtrooper playing the banjo so you don't have to
43:27
create an ad. You can create like some just cool viral videos using this process. You can see the examples of the
43:32
avatar generation here as well. Um, we even have an example of me holding this
43:37
book and then talking about the book and that sort of thing. So, let's play that about a book that has genuinely changed
43:43
the way Hey everyone, today I want to talk to you about a book that has genuinely changed the way I approach building connections online. So, that
43:50
sends it up to FA. We wait two minutes. We download the brand video and then we upload it to Google Drive like this. So
43:57
really powerful workflow. Professor DY says user generated content. Can you
44:03
elaborate please? Yeah. So with user generated content,
44:08
what this means is it's kind of like a vlog style, right? So you've got different ways of creating content. And
44:16
one of the best ways I think when it comes to like a sort of usability
44:21
perspective is generating like user generated stuff which means like it's kind of it kind of feels like a blog if
44:27
that makes sense. I want to show you some more examples here. So let me find an example here.
44:32
I used to struggle with all right. So here's an example of UGC versus non UGC. Right. And this
44:41
is kind of all included in same inside the same website. So for example here, this is kind of like UGC, right? So he's
44:47
pulling up the phone, he's creating the content himself. He's talking directly to the camera and it feels like a book,
44:53
right? So that's what UGC is when it comes to that stuff. And then if we play
44:58
this, you can see an example, right? And then this is more like kind of a a movie style or advert style,
45:06
right? Where you've got a guy laughing. He's with his friends. The camera is very professional. Professional etc.
45:12
Used to struggle with my skin but finding this again is not UGC because it's not
45:17
on the phone. He's not recording it himself. The right routine has given me and then this is still again not UGC.
45:24
Right. So that's a big difference between them and how it works by so this is basically how it works people how to
45:30
use it how to set it up etc.
45:36
If you ever have any issues with running the workflow, sharing this has been a here's another example. But if you ever
45:42
have any problems running the workflow and that sort of thing, then just test it step by step. But also, you've
45:50
got to be careful as well because for example, when you're when you're running this, sometimes the APIs don't work,
45:55
right? APIs can let you down. No one really tells you that on YouTube videos, but when it comes to these APIs, like
46:01
sometimes, for example, B3 can it can break or banana can break. So it's just
46:06
something to be aware of as well. It's like if you have a problem and it's the API specifically is that module for
46:11
example post into file then just try rerunning the workflow and sometimes that works as well. So here's another
46:18
example of UGC. This is again the same product but this time we've used a female sharing this has been a journey but look
46:25
feels so much better now. So that's more like UGC style. She's holding the camera etc.
46:31
So that's basically how it works step by step. If you want to get all the workflows from today, feel free to get it inside the AR money lab link in the
46:37
comments description. If you go to the classroom over here, then you're going to scroll down, click on free N
46:42
automation templates, and from here you've got all these different templates. We also have, for example, workflows for podcasts,
46:49
nano banana image generators, personalized newsletter agents, etc. You get all this stuff free inside the AI
46:55
money lab. If you need help, if you need support, if you want to connect with me personally, then join the AI profit
47:01
boardroom. Inside there, we have an awesome community of people trying to help each other. You know, one of the biggest problems with like free groups
47:07
is, you know, sometimes you get scammers or the quality is not that good. Some people giving you advice and they've
47:12
never done it before, etc. And the great thing about the AI profit boardroom is it just filters out serious builders,
47:18
you know, people who are serious about growing their business, saving time, making money with AI, etc. And so that's
47:23
why we built the AR profit boardroom. connects people who are really serious about automating and scaling their
47:29
business with AI. And then also inside the classroom here, you get access to all these different courses like you can
47:34
see including our best NA10 templates and workflows. There's a lot more automations like there that are going to
47:40
help you. And then also you can see that we've got Seuite Masterass if you've
47:45
never done this before, you know, if you're struggling. And then additionally, you got all these social media email content automations, the
47:51
playbook that I use for my business personally, an agency landing clients and then we have like a YouTube course
47:58
as well and AI SEO course. So anything AI related you're going to find inside classroom and then additionally here
48:05
inside the AR profit boardroom you can jump on this weekly coaching course. We have five per week and if you can't make
48:10
them you can watch them back. So thanks very much for watching. Professor Dy says fantastic class look forward to
48:15
seeing you in the AR profit boardroom. Great work your business in the pack. Appreciate you. Thanks for all the questions out today. If anyone is here
48:23
watching and you want to become a client, typically we charge like $2,000 for automation. So if you are thinking
48:30
about becoming a client, hire us to do this stuff for you, maybe you want to save hundreds of hours, you're a busy entrepreneur, etc. Then you can book in
48:37
a call here. On that call, we're going to look at where you spend your time, what systems you need to build to save
48:42
that time and automate stuff, and then we'll go and implement it if you hire us. All right? So feel free to book in
48:48
that call. It's completely free if you want to book it in, but it is about becoming quiet, just being 100% transparent. So, see you on the next
48:54
one. Cheers for watching. Thank you. Bye-bye. Today we have the brand new update from
49:02
Google, which allows you to build apps ridiculously easy. You don't even need a brain to be able to use this bad boy.
49:07
I'll show you exactly how it works. But essentially, you can see here I've got this photo editing app that I literally just built in one click. It's incredibly
49:15
easy. And this is all for free, right? Using AI Studio. Now, the amazing thing about this is it also uses AI inside the
49:23
apps that you build. So, you can see, for example, here we're using Google's Nano Banana image editing app, right?
49:30
So, we're not just creating images, we're actually editing them using this process. You basically create like your own version of Photoshop almost using
49:37
the process that I'm about to show you today. It is absolutely wild what you can do here. And I'm also going to give
49:43
you 50 different prompts you can use along with this side by side so that you can start using this too. Now if you
49:50
want to see exactly how it works, let me show you how to do this. But first of all, I want to show you that it does actually work, right? So for example, if
49:57
we duplicate this and we'll just refresh the page like we go to AI Studio like
50:03
you can see here. And then we've got the code assistance. So this is where we can actually build out the code here if we want to add new features. For example,
50:10
add a reset button, that sort of stuff. And then over here we can insert our image. So if we click on here, then
50:15
we're going to upload the thumbnail from today for example. Then we're going to say okay, make the background yellow,
50:21
right? And you can use this as a free editing app using Nano Bananas API. And
50:26
then we're going to scroll down here and we've got the original image. So this is taking the image from the image that
50:33
I've uploaded here. And then you can see full screen. We've got the example here. By the way, if you want to zoom in, zoom
50:39
out, you press command and plus or command and minus. If you want to reset, press command zero. And then from here,
50:45
you can start using this to edit your photos. Right? So, you see here we've got the original image. They use Nano
50:51
Banana, Google's Nano Banana API. I haven't paid for this. Completely free to build out this app that actually
50:57
works. It's insane. Now, if you want to learn exactly how to use this stuff, we've actually got tons of training like
51:02
you see inside the AI Money Lab link in the comments description. And then from here you can see the video notes and we
51:08
also have some other automations you can actually do where it's oneclick sort of image editing and image creation along
51:13
with 50 different image generation ideas with prompts that you can use to generate this stuff right so for example
51:20
here API only came out when like last week right about seven or eight days ago
51:26
so to have this incorporated directly into AI studio it is completely new this
51:31
is a novel thing this has only just come across right so for example here You can type in your prompt here. So, you're
51:37
going to go to a studio.google.com. Then, you're going to go to build on the left hand side here. There is a chat
51:43
feature here. It's not as good for building stuff, right? You can use nana banana in there, but again, not as good
51:48
as going to build down here, and then you could type in this or use whatever prompt you want from the AI money lab.
51:54
You could also take, for example, these app ideas. So, you could copy them. Then
51:59
you could go to chat GBT, right? And you can say, "Okay, based on what you know
52:06
about me, give me some app ideas like these that would be really good for me
52:14
personally." And the only person in the world that's actually going to know that stuff is like your mom and chat GBT, but
52:19
your mom doesn't build apps probably. So your chat GBT can and that's what we're
52:24
using to come up with these ideas. So for example, like a AI blog post generator, backlink visualizer, s me
52:30
generator, etc., Right. And it's really simple and easy to do. Now, once you've done that, you can go into AI Studio in
52:36
the build section. Hit enter like so. Run the prompt. Boom. Shakalaka. You're ready to go. Now, if we go back to that
52:42
app that we actually built a second ago, and whilst this is building out, we can wait for that in the background. Over
52:48
here, we've got the new app that we're building. And what you can actually do is you can download that app, right? So,
52:54
some people were asking me the other day like, how do you export this stuff? you can export it like and if you do that
53:00
like you see over here you've actually got the app ready to go. So if we click on that we've got all the files directly
53:06
here. Now I'm not 100% sure if this is going to work. One thing we could try is
53:12
we can open that up. But the other thing we could do here is if we want to host it you can just go to netlefi.com. So
53:18
you can go to netlefi.com you can add a new project import an existing project. Try netify drop. Grab that folder like
53:26
plug that bad boy into Netlify. Right. So, grab that and then we're
53:32
going to drag it over to Netlify like so. And that should upload. All right.
53:37
So, we can upload and host our files on a subdomain like you can see right here. And it doesn't cost anything to host it
53:43
on a subdomain, but then if you actually want to test out or try it, etc., then you would host that on a real domain
53:49
later. The other thing you could do is just tell AI studio to put it into
53:54
format that you can host. If you need more help on that, just join the AI profit board and web app. Now, what we're doing here is we are building out
54:01
the app. So, this is a meme app that we've plugged into Gemini to start building this out. That's creating the
54:08
preview. Boom. It works straight away, right? Then from here, we can upload our cat photo. We can add the text bottom
54:14
left, etc. And the preview, right? So, if we wanted, let's start off with a picture of a cat, right? So, we're going
54:22
to go into Google here. See what we got. Let's have a look at the images.
54:27
See what we wanted to create. All right. So, for example, like this. Let's say we wanted to create that. So, what we can
54:33
do over here is go to Google Gemini. Then, we're going to flick on tools and
54:39
then we're going to create images. Again, this is free. I'm just going to show you how you could use this stuff. You don't have to create cat memes, but
54:45
obviously you would make the world a better place if you did. And then from here, we can say, okay,
54:51
with a birthday cake and one candle looking grumpy.
54:58
All right. Now, if you actually want to see how I like to use this stuff in a real life example, just join the AR
55:04
profit boardroom inside there. Essentially, we have this community, 1,200 builders who are actually building
55:10
stuff and creating stuff that's actually going to grow their business, right? Obviously, cat mean generators. Not the
55:15
best business use case, but if you want to learn how to use this stuff properly to really make money, scale your business, and save a lot of time, then
55:22
join the AI profit border link in the comments description. So, from here, we've got the grumpy cat. We're going to
55:27
download that. All right, so we've downloaded that image. Then, we're going to go over here and we'll just check if this works. It might not work, but let's
55:33
test it out. So, the image works straight away, which is great. Let's see if we can recreate this. So, I just wanted to eat cake. Boom. There we go.
55:40
So, we got the top text and then Hman lit it on fire. And we could delete
55:46
that. Make that nicer. And then boom. Look at that. We've actually created a nicer meme than the original to be
55:52
honest using AI. All right. So, if we scroll down here, this is the original image. This one is better. Is way
55:58
better. I'm creating better memes than most of the internet, let's be honest. And then you can download that meme. You can open it up and all of a sudden,
56:05
mate, you just created yourself a free app using AI in the space of one minute that creates better memes than the
56:11
original. Essentially, you can see the power of this and how easy it is to start building out this stuff. What we
56:17
got here, Brook, shout out from New Zealand. That's what we're talking about. Shout out to New Zealand. I don't
56:22
know if you ever used to watch it, but Flight of the Concords. Great series. Great series from the New Zealand. I
56:27
actually have a mate who lives on my floor at the place I stay and he is from
56:33
New Zealand as well. Great people. Great people. Let me know where else we've got people streaming from. Be interesting to
56:39
see who we've got worldwide. Let me know in the comments. So essentially, you can see how we can build out these cat meme
56:47
generators or app editors. We can create image creators like we've just done here or image editors like we did over here.
56:55
And you can do this in one single click. It doesn't cost you anything. You don't need to be able to code. Like how crazy
57:00
is that? It It blows my mind. Now, also you can edit these apps. So, we could say, for example, add save image. And
57:06
what you actually see here on the left hand side inside the coding section is that it recommends different features
57:11
that you can use directly for your app, right? So, not only do you not have to code, not only do you get this for free,
57:17
not only can it edit images and do it better than the originals, but also you can add new features and you don't even
57:23
have to think about what features you need to add because it's going to come up with those directly inside the chat here. So, for example, here we could add
57:28
a reset button. We could plug that prompt in. It comes up with the prop for us. We don't need to touch it. And then it's using Gemini 2.5 Pro to develop
57:36
that app and add the new UI element that's going to include the reset button. Pretty amazing, too. And you can
57:44
also do this side by side. So you can code each of these side by side as you go along. That's really simple as well.
57:50
We could add a font size slider here as well and then just code two things at the same time. So we've got the cat meme
57:55
generator with a new font editing feature. And then also inside the AI
58:01
studio over here, we have the addin functionality for the reset feature. Boom. All right. Now, if you like Nano
58:08
Banana, you're going to this next one as well. And so we actually have an automation that creates like images and
58:14
videos if you want to click too. So as an example of that, let me pull this up. You can actually get the JSON for free
58:19
inside the AI money lab. So you can just grab the free JSON files here that you can import into NA10. But if you go over
58:25
to NA10 over here and then we're going to open up a new workflow. There we go. Let's go to my workflows over here. And
58:33
once that is loaded, like you can see over here, we've got for example like a nano image generator.
58:40
Or for example, we have a ad generator using nano as well. And you can download
58:45
these for free inside the AI money lab. So for example, here we can test this
58:52
one out. Let's have a look at this. So this is an image to video generator. Let's take a look at this bad boy. So
58:59
that's one example of what you can do. And then let's keep scrolling down here.
59:05
This one is one of my favorites actually. Let's go here. So, with this
59:10
one, what you can actually do is you can upload an image and then what it's going to do is create a video ad based on that
59:19
image, right? So, you can see here it takes a brand asset input, plugs it through Google Drive, you get three
59:24
different agents. So, you create it, it's going to create a video, then it's going to pump out the video and download it over here. So, if you want to see an
59:31
example of that previously, right? So, if we go to executions, you can see previous examples here. And if we scroll
59:37
down, let's see what we got. For example, like this. We'll pull this up.
59:43
And you can see this is a video generated from an image using this workflow as well. Nano Banana is
59:49
actually free for the weekend. I know for some people the weekend is still ending right now when I'm doing this
59:55
live stream at the time of this recording. So, you can still jump on this. But you can see here, for example, we created this kind of advert style
1:00:02
trailer using the AI avatar. So this is the AI avatar and he's using the product over here using this process via NA10.
1:00:11
So what you do essentially is when you're running it, you're going to run it through here, plug it into the brand
1:00:19
strategy agent, the creative director is going to edit it, the production specialist is going to edit it, and then
1:00:24
it's going to run through this workflow like and then essentially what you end up with is an image like you can see
1:00:30
over here. I used to struggle with my skin. And that includes audio and a voiceover
1:00:35
as well. Pretty cool. Here's another one. Let's pull this one up. So, this is
1:00:41
another avatar video that we generated using this automation. Then, if we play this, she's actually
1:00:47
speaking right now. Obviously, I'm not going to play that on the live stream cuz the sound won't be good. But you can see here how you can create these sort
1:00:53
of mini adverts using a combination of nano banana and then running it through
1:00:59
this workflow to create a video as well. Again, if you want the free automation for this, it's inside the AI profit
1:01:06
board along with all of these prompts. This all this free stuff, right? The final thing that you could do as well is
1:01:11
you could just generate images with one click inside MA102. Let me show you an example of that. So, if we pull up might
1:01:19
be this one. Let's have a look. So if we go inside here and we'll say okay cat
1:01:24
eating a banana. Basically what this going to do is use Google Gemini chat model which is nano banana and then
1:01:31
generate an image and convert and download it over here. Right? You can see how the AI agent is coming up with a
1:01:37
prompt that's going to run it through this workflow. We're going to download that over here and then it's converting
1:01:43
the file. And then if we go over here, we've got the image of the cat eating the banana.
1:01:50
Really simple and easy to generate using this workflow. And you can download that as well and import it into NA10 like you
1:01:57
can see down here. So it's pretty amazing what you could do with Gemini. I think honestly it's probably the best API in the world right now to code with
1:02:05
especially since Nano Banana just came out. It's what we're using pretty much for everything coding related just cuz
1:02:12
Gemini is just so consistent and you can use all of these processes to build like
1:02:17
your own coding agent using Google directly. And then you can see here as well inside
1:02:24
the chat you can also generate images for free. So if you select Nana the banana inside a studio.google.com
1:02:30
google.com for example, say generate an image of a banana wearing a costume and then over here it generates the image
1:02:36
like so. Really cool stuff. The other cool thing here is if we go back to the
1:02:42
start, you can actually see what other people are creating as well. So you've got a list of your apps that you've built. For example, the cami generator.
1:02:49
These apps are saved. So we can always come back to them if we have recent changes that we want to make. We can go
1:02:54
to showcase as well. Now, so also some people will use Firebase for this stuff too, but also you can share the app. So
1:03:01
if you click on share over here, this will generate a URL that you can share with people. And if you hit publish like
1:03:08
so, that's now sharable, published everyone on the web. And so now if we
1:03:13
click on this, you can see that we can share that app with other people. I will
1:03:18
put it inside the video notes from today inside the AI money lab. So if you want to get that, you can. So that's sharable
1:03:26
and you can use it for free. And then also what we can do over here is if we close that, we can share the photo
1:03:33
editor too. So I'm going to hit save. And you can see it's now got the reset button that we coded into the app, which
1:03:41
is great. We're just going to hit publish on that. And then we can make that sharable, too. So if you want a
1:03:48
free image editing app, you've got it like there. And then also one of the
1:03:54
things that I want to show you here is one thing that will be really useful for me that I use every single day pretty much is I can say YouTube thumbnail
1:04:02
generator escape dimensions low text attention grabbing clue based stuff
1:04:10
right we enter like so and again we can just build out that app as well and
1:04:15
that's actually something that a lot of people watching will probably use every single day. So, we'll wait for that to load. So, you can code it. You can see
1:04:23
it coding out here. It's building out the different project files on the right hand side with the chat on the left and
1:04:28
the progress here. So, also runs through a checklist and it ticks everything up as it goes
1:04:34
along. You can see how quick and fast is. That's the other thing I like about Gemini is it's really quick and easy to
1:04:39
use, too. And then we should have the thumbnail generator like, right? So, if
1:04:45
we enter the prompts for our thumbnail, I'm just going to say, okay, a robot looking
1:04:51
shot whilst typing on a laptop. I'll put rainbow colors, something like that,
1:04:58
just to see what it's capable of. Again, we've only built this in one click, but
1:05:03
it's pretty cool. And there we go. That's our YouTube thumbnail ready to go. You could say, okay, make it sleek
1:05:10
and photo realistic. There we go. So, that's your thumbnail ready to go. You could as well put Let's
1:05:18
try this. Add text. Gemini is insane. I don't know if it's
1:05:25
going to add the text cuz I put inside the instructions. I'll do that. Let's see if it does it. There we go. Look at
1:05:31
that. That's pretty cool. And then we can say okay make we'll change it from
1:05:38
photo realistic to neon futuristic style.
1:05:45
The other thing I like about building with Nano Banana is that when you're using the API, it just feels like a lot
1:05:52
more it feels a lot faster, right? Whereas if you're generating even on the paid API, if you're generating images
1:05:59
using chat, it can take so long. Sometimes 2 minutes for one single image. Whereas in that space of time,
1:06:05
you could build out an app and generate an image using Google AI Studio and the Gemini Coder here. So there we go. We
1:06:11
got the image. That thumbnail will probably do quite well on YouTube to be honest. It's really easy and simple to create. You know, if you had a team, you
1:06:19
can now share this app with the team as well. So, let me make that public. We'll copy that. We'll plug it into the image.
1:06:27
Put the details here. Image creation app or YouTube
1:06:33
thumbnail creation app. All right. And just to recap here, we've done a lot.
1:06:39
What I've shown you today is how to build apps for free inside Google Gemini. How to plug in any prompt you
1:06:45
want and build whatever you want. We've also built a photo editor app, a cat me
1:06:51
generator app, an image editing app, and also a YouTube thumbnail creation app.
1:06:56
We got Marinella from Italy. Shout to you. And then inside here, I've shown
1:07:02
you how to download and host it. You can also deploy this directly inside here. So I think you would load that as a
1:07:08
Google cloud project and then you can host it on Google Cloud if you want to. I've also shown you how to automate
1:07:13
images using Nano Banana inside NA10. And I've given
1:07:19
you 50 different prompts of different apps you can build using
1:07:24
Gemini Coder along with the free templates and APIs so that you can build
1:07:29
your own apps directly inside N10 and create images or videos or ads directly
1:07:34
using that process as well. actually says, "Hi, good to see you here." And
1:07:39
yeah, this is also a video tutorial showing you step by step exactly how to set up. So that's all inside the AI
1:07:45
money lab. If you want the video notes from today along with the links and everything else, then you go to the AI
1:07:50
money lab, go to classroom and then go to new automations and then you will see new Gemini coder on the left hand side
1:07:58
down here. All right. And then you can see exactly everything you need to know. Now, inside this community as well, you
1:08:04
can connect with like 24,500 people. We're constantly dropping new trainings as you can see inside the community
1:08:10
here. Very active. And then also inside the classroom, you get access to all of these different trainings like you can
1:08:16
see along with some of my best NA10 automations completely for free. Look at that. including a browser use agent,
1:08:22
Google AI avatars, loveorn NA10 automations, outbound calls agents, and a thousand different NA10 templates you
1:08:29
can just use directly here along with an podcast AI agent as well. So that's all for free inside the money lab link in
1:08:35
the comments description. And then if you want to connect with me personally, the only place I really connect with
1:08:41
people personally is inside the AI profit boardroom. We also run five weekly live coaching calls per week. So
1:08:48
you can jump on those calls, ask any questions you have, that sort of thing. Inside the community here, we're running
1:08:53
giveaways. We have tons of different people posting and just helping each other and learning and growing from each other. You can see, for example, I
1:09:00
actually posted on here today, giving you some ideas on this stuff. Yeah, loads of cool stuff in there. And then
1:09:06
also inside the classroom here, if you don't know where to start, a lot of people are like, I'm a total beginner. I don't know where to start. Maybe I need
1:09:12
to be technical to join this. You don't need to be technical to join this. is built for anyone at any stage, right? So, if you're a beginner, totally fine.
1:09:19
You can just learn from the six week AI automation masterass and learn all the fundamentals from scratch so that you
1:09:25
have the right knowledge in place for building with AI however you want to. However, if you have something specific
1:09:31
in mind, for example, like maybe you want to create videos like I do with AI, you can learn from the processes
1:09:37
directly inside the AI profit boardroom social media video automation section over here. Right. Additionally, we have
1:09:44
inside the AI profit boardroom our foundations and getting started and that sort of thing. And then we have our best
1:09:52
NA10 templates and workflows. And these are all categorized into different sections here. So you can see video
1:09:57
based templates, scraping, social media, audio based templates, email outbound
1:10:02
and inbound emails, website templates, AI personal
1:10:08
assistance templates, and just a random bunch of other stuff directly here as well. Additionally, what else have we
1:10:15
got? If you're an agency for us, we have a lot of AI automation clients. So we basically teach the whole process inside
1:10:21
this section here. So inside the agency course step by step you can see exactly how to get more clients and then if we
1:10:29
scroll down we do have let's have a look here inside the YouTube section we have
1:10:34
a whole section on like how to grow your YouTube channel just like I have using this YouTube course here and it's okay
1:10:40
week one you do this week two you do that etc.world World says, "I'm in." Shout out to you.
1:10:46
Asha says, "I will learn. Good for you. Hope to see you inside the AI profit boardroom." And just to recap, yeah,
1:10:52
here's everything you get. So, hope to see you in there. And if you're just like Julian, I don't want to do any of
1:10:59
this stuff, but I do want to jump on a call with you or your team to figure out, okay, how can we implement this
1:11:06
business? Maybe you want to become a client of ours, right? You can book in a free AI automation session on this call.
1:11:12
Step by step, we're going to analyze where you spend your time, right? Where do you spend your time right now so that we can figure out, okay, what's the one
1:11:18
biggest constraint that if you solved right now would five or 10x your business and save you a lot of time. So
1:11:24
that's step number one. Step number two is we figure out, okay, what is the best automation to build right now for your
1:11:31
business that's going to save you hundreds of hours? And we do this all with you. And then the final step is if
1:11:37
you hire us to do this, then on that call, we're going to go off and implement this for you. Now, typically
1:11:44
power automation is about $1,500 or $2,000 per automation. But if you just
1:11:49
like a busy entrepreneur, you don't have time to implement this stuff yourself, you need it, then book in a call here
1:11:55
and we can just jump on that call with you and show you exactly what you'll need to automate and how much it's going to cost. All right. So, appreciate you
1:12:01
watching and again, if you want the free stuff, join the AI money lab. Completely free, doesn't cost a penny. And I will
1:12:07
see you on the next one. Cheers for watching. Bye-bye. Breaking news. There's a new update from
1:12:14
Google that's completely free. And they're basically allowed for this weekend only. A free tier of Gemini API
1:12:21
to access Gemini 2.5 Flash image for this weekend only. Today I'm going to
1:12:26
show you exactly how you can build insane automations like you can see right here along with image apps
1:12:32
completely for free using the process that I'm about to break down for you. And I'm going to show you step by step
1:12:37
how to build your own automations using Nano Banana update and also how to build your own image generation apps
1:12:44
completely free. And also on top of that, I'm going to give you 50 different image generation ideas plus prompts that
1:12:51
you can use today to start building this stuff out so you can make the most of it before the end of this weekend. All
1:12:56
right. So, for example, if we have a look at this app, what we can do is we can open up the chat like and then we
1:13:02
can plug in whatever image we want to generate and using this free AI agent, we can then generate images and then
1:13:08
download the image. So, let's say for example, okay, superhero cat, something like that, right? and we plug that in.
1:13:15
That's going to take the chat message from here. Now, it's going to start building out the image using the free
1:13:21
API from Google Gemini. Like you can see, that's then taken the inputs from
1:13:27
the AI agent and plugged it into this file right here. And if we click on view, we now have the image of a cat
1:13:34
eating a banana. Boom. Shakalaka. Super easy to do. So the way that we can do this is we can start generating images
1:13:41
by using this AI agent and then we're going to edit fields manually to start using that data. Right? That's one of
1:13:48
the options. The other option that we have is we can generate images and applications like this AI thumbnail
1:13:55
generator. Basically all you do is you enter a title and a description to generate a unique thumbnail using AI.
1:14:01
Now, if you want to build out that, I actually have the free template inside the AI money lad link in the comments
1:14:07
description. Completely free. Comes with community of 24,000 people plus all these free trainings we drop every
1:14:12
single day. And if we go to the classroom and then we scroll down, we go to money free AI automation templates,
1:14:18
right? So, Money Lab Classroom, free NA10 automation templates. Nano Banana
1:14:24
is right there. And you can download all the JSON prompts that I'm giving you today. All right? You can steal this
1:14:31
stuff from me if you want to along with the video generator app that actually created directly here. You can get the templates free right there. Boobs
1:14:37
jackal. All right. What you can do here is inside this section, you would then just take these fields from nano banana
1:14:46
and start converting this to a file. Right? Really simple and easy to do. Now, the other thing that you can do
1:14:51
here is you can go into Gemini up. We go to Gemini Google app and then we can
1:14:58
take one of these prompts like you can see over here to start building an app. Now the important thing here is when
1:15:04
you're using Nana Banana you want to grab a API key directly from AI studio.
1:15:09
All the links are inside the AI money lab if you need to get this stuff but essentially you're going to go down to
1:15:15
get API key on a studio.google.com. So get API key and then from here you
1:15:21
are going to grab an API key. All right. So let's say for example we want to create a new API key. We can grab one.
1:15:28
So I'll t this one and then I'll delete it later. So if we copy this and then we go into Google Gemini, we're going to
1:15:35
plug this. We're going to say API key equals right and then from here we're
1:15:42
going to use whatever prompt we want to deal with the app. Now honestly from what I've seen the simpler the better for these apps, right? So, I'm going to
1:15:48
say, okay, create a YouTube thumbnail image generation app using Google image API nana banana. Right, I'm just
1:15:55
specifying which API we're going to be using. Super simple and easy. We've got the API key here. Honestly, I'm going to
1:16:00
delete that after the live stream because obviously you shouldn't be showing that live. And then we are going
1:16:05
to generate this like so. All right. And now what you can see here is Gemini is
1:16:11
beginning to build out and code out a app really quickly using this process.
1:16:19
All right, so we've got the image generator app. Now it says YouTube thumbnail generator. Enter a prompt to
1:16:26
generate a suning thumbnail image. Right, so let's take one of my recent thumbnails for ideas. And then we're
1:16:32
going to go back over here and we'll say, okay, mad driving the supercar
1:16:38
looking green. Something like that. I'll in. And this isn't guaranteed to work
1:16:43
straight away. So, we've just created this in one click. Let's see what it comes back with. We'll see how it goes
1:16:49
so far. But yeah, we have the image generator using the API key that's completely free from Google as you can
1:16:57
see. So, you can basically build your own image generation apps really quickly now. And then you can download the image
1:17:03
if you want to save this. Boom. There we go. Open up. And we have the image for our thumbnail generator ready to go.
1:17:10
Now, there's a few things that I would improve on that. It's very rough, but you get the point. Like, you can easily build your own image generation apps.
1:17:17
How easy is that? I don't need to code. I don't need to understand really what I'm doing. I don't even need to understand how to use the API. I just
1:17:23
have to paste in its details up here. Super simple and easy. All right. And then if he was struggling for promps or
1:17:30
that sort of thing, you could just go into something like chat GPT and you could say something like, okay,
1:17:37
I have a video about and insert whatever your video is about. So let's say I have a
1:17:43
video about a new AI robot. Give me an idea for a YouTube
1:17:53
thumbnail. And then we can get prompt ideas from chat GPT. automate that and then plug them into our YouTube
1:17:59
thumbnail generator that we've created free. All right. So, we've got some ideas here. We'll take that. We'll grab
1:18:06
this. We'll plug that in. Hit generate thumbnail. And then we can automate the
1:18:11
prompt creation as well. So, there we go. We've got the thumbnail where to go. The one thing I would say with this app
1:18:16
is obviously you want to tell it inside the coding to make sure that the thumbnails generated are the same
1:18:23
dimensions as YouTube. So that's more like a vertical than a landscape, but you get the point. Like you can easily
1:18:28
build this off. If you wanted to change it, we can just say over here, okay, change this to landscape mode. And then
1:18:35
we should be good to go. So you can see how simple and easy that is. And then if
1:18:40
we plug the same thing in here. So let's change this cyborg.
1:18:45
So we say cyborg and neon colors fighting with AI robots. Wait for that to generate and then we should be good to go. But you could also create other
1:18:52
stuff as well. So, I've actually got 50 different use cases inside the AI money lab. So, if we scroll down here, you see
1:18:59
all our different ideas for generating stuff. For example, Mafia poster generator is in this out. And there we
1:19:05
go. So, you've got the thumbnail uh dimensions ready to go. This in landscape mode now. And then you could
1:19:10
easily use that as a thumbnail for whatever cyborg related video you're doing. But you can always tweak the
1:19:16
prompts to whenever you want. What else we got here? The infinite says, "I built a football uniform generator and it's
1:19:22
awesome." Yeah, that's a pretty cool idea to be fair. And then a circular says, "What is a new update?" So, the
1:19:29
new update is that Google AR Studio this weekend only have unlocked a free tier
1:19:34
of the Gemini API to access Gemini 2.5 Flash image, which means that you can build AI agents and also apps using Nano
1:19:42
Banana, which is pretty cool. All right. Yz says, "Why are you using 2.5 flash
1:19:48
not pro?" I think it just came up on default. And then Vivx says, "Is there any free tool like your small work for
1:19:53
your small work like making quiz, slide maker, all that stuff run locally?" I made a HTML code, but I can't find free
1:19:59
onetime download. Yeah. So, you can you if you want to build an app that runs
1:20:04
locally, just do it inside Visual Studio Code. A lot of training inside the AI profit boardroom on how to do that. So
1:20:11
if you go inside the AI profit won't appear and then we'll type an app and let's try it's code. Yeah. So you can
1:20:19
see all these different trainings on Visual Studio Code and then you can host one of those locally and just build that
1:20:24
way. The other thing you can do is you can use bolt DIY. So bolt DIY you can
1:20:30
actually host locally and you can build apps offline using that process as well with a free API from open router. So
1:20:36
that's another option there. The other thing I was going to say here is I actually tried building with lovable and
1:20:43
bolt using the same sort of idea and it was way quicker, way easier and actually worked inside Gemini. Much better,
1:20:51
right? So I wouldn't recommend using anything else. And then Infinite says, "How hard is it to move an app over to
1:20:57
Firebase for multi-user support? Any tips or tricks?" I think you can just export it
1:21:03
and then upload it or you can just create it from scratch inside Firebase Studio. And Circular Fash says,
1:21:09
"Anything I could use for my secondhand luxury clothing business?" Yeah, like for example, you could it's whatever,
1:21:15
right? So like this, if we went inside the chat here, we said, "Okay, create a
1:21:22
YouTube or create an image generation app for my luxury
1:21:28
clothing business." And then you can just come up with ideas. Now if you don't if you're running out of ideas for that then what
1:21:35
you can do is you can take this pro. So go to chat GPT new chat plug this in and
1:21:42
just say give me 10 image generation app ideas for my luxury clothing business as
1:21:50
well. And then you can get the ideas on track GBT and create them inside generate. So you can for example like
1:21:56
design a luxury clothing item use that as a generate image. You could also, for example, create like a virtual try on
1:22:03
lookbook, right? So people can basically upload a photo of the image of themselves, upload an image of whatever
1:22:11
they want to try on and then they're good to go as well, right? So if they have some luxury clothing in mind and
1:22:16
they have an image of themselves, they can actually get the AI to do that directly here as well. And then he says,
1:22:21
"Off topic, but what's the best LM for studying and learning your opinion?" 100% is notebook. out. Notebook is the
1:22:29
go when it comes to learning. Super powerful, really easy to use, completely free if you're on the free tier, of
1:22:35
course. And then from here, you can build out like really cool ways. So, so you can, for example, create a podcast,
1:22:42
a video, a mindm, reports, studying guides, etc. And you can also use the
1:22:48
interface here to ask any questions about whatever source you're trying to learn about. Right? So, if I plug in
1:22:53
some YouTube videos or a PDF or a course, etc. on the left hand side. We can then ask the GPT and then from here
1:22:59
it will spit out all these different learning guides which is really easy as well. The other thing you can do here is
1:23:04
you can start a new chat and if you want to learn something, put in the information that you want to learn about
1:23:09
and then just say create like a flashcard quiz that I can use to test me and teach me this topic that I'm trying
1:23:15
to learn about. So that's another way that you can use this too. So that's
1:23:20
basically how it works step by step. The other thing I want to show you is NA10. So if we go inside NA10 over here, we
1:23:27
can use Nana banana directly inside here too. All right. So open up the instance.
1:23:32
NA10 is free to use if you run it locally. I've got training inside the AI prof boardroom. If you want to know how
1:23:38
to get a template like this, then it's inside the AI money man as well. But
1:23:44
essentially what we have here is an AI agent. And then we can go inside here and say okay cat eating banana. It's
1:23:52
using Google Gemini chat to generate the image that's going to edit fields and then it's going to convert it into a
1:23:58
file that we can actually download and view. Right? So, click on that. Click view. Boom. Shackle with the cat eating
1:24:04
the benon. There's a few ways you can use this. So, if we go over to my N10 workspace over here and we sh.
1:24:13
So, here's another workflow example. With this one, you can actually generate
1:24:19
images to video, right? So you can for example type in whatever image you want
1:24:24
inside the chat here and then it will use runway to turn that image into a
1:24:30
video as well and then it will pull out the request directly there. So that's another way you can use this as well but
1:24:37
it's pretty simple and easy. Now if we go back inside here the other way that
1:24:42
we can use this we go inside executions is you can actually use this with open
1:24:48
router. Now if you use it with open router it is going to be paid right cuz
1:24:53
you're using the paid API but if you're using it beyond this weekend I would recommend using that. So if we copy that
1:24:59
to editor like so up in all the files like this and then
1:25:05
version history. So you can actually if you don't know this already you can actually restore like previous versions of NA10 when
1:25:12
you're building out these AI agents. So you can see here we have the AI agent with Google Gemini and the free API over
1:25:19
here and you can download that from the money lab inside the JSON section here. But if you want to for example use open
1:25:26
router beyond this weekend then you can we'll click on restore this version and
1:25:32
I'll show you how this works. So let's go back here inside the chat and then
1:25:39
you see here basically when a chat message receives that's going to send the content router and then we're going
1:25:46
to convert that to a file. So if we type in here okay cat playing basketball
1:25:52
with a gang and then you can see here we just have to change the API. So if we
1:25:59
get the new API key from there we go we'll copy that. So that's
1:26:04
the API key that we want to use. So image preview.
1:26:10
So you see how we've updated the API key details here and now it works. So we're
1:26:15
going to hit save. Then I'm going to try again. Hit enter. And there we go. The
1:26:21
blanket says first time I caught you live. Thank you sir. Keep doing what you're
1:26:27
doing. Appreciate it, mate. But yeah, that's essentially how you can use Nano Banana directly inside the chat here as
1:26:34
well. The other cool thing you can do with Nano Banana as well is you can
1:26:40
generate videos too. So here's an example where we're actually using BO3,
1:26:48
right? So essentially you can go inside this viral videos template and you can
1:26:53
actually generate using Gemini Banana videos from the image. Now, this one is not free, but I'll show you how it works
1:27:00
step by step. So, if we go to Gemini
1:27:05
and let's say you got an image that you want to use. So, if we go back to image generations here and we'll put a staff
1:27:12
trooper, claim the banjo. It says videos free. No, this is not free. This this
1:27:19
section that I'm showing you right now is not free. Right. So, we're going to download that and then we're going to go
1:27:24
inside here and we are going to switch to brand video web hook. Again, you can
1:27:31
get this template if you scroll down and you go to Google avatar section. You can get the template that I'm showing you
1:27:37
right now, right, for free from me. And then you just need to pay for the Veo 3 API when you're doing this. What we're
1:27:44
going to do here is we're going to click brand asset input execute. That's going
1:27:50
to open up a pop-up form. Workload the image that we just got. There we go. And then we'll say, okay, start
1:27:59
advertising a new banjo. Something like, right, what
1:28:05
you can see is that's now running it the brief for a brand strategy agent, then a
1:28:11
creative director, then a production specialist. Once that's done and then it's going to
1:28:17
send it over to foul to generate the video with Vo3. So you can see how that's
1:28:24
waiting for the trigger event. Essentially what's happening here is we put in our image and our brand details
1:28:29
that goes to a brand strategy agent. We have a creative director agent production specialist and then we send
1:28:36
this over to FA which generates the image into a video using FA and Bayer 3.
1:28:43
Now, when that's running, it's also creating a web hook. So, once it's finished generating the video, that's
1:28:50
going to trigger this workflow over here. And then you'll get a video
1:28:56
generated from the image we plugged into the workflow. So, you can see that's
1:29:01
running now on the workflow that's sending it over to Google Drive. And we should have a video inside our Google
1:29:07
Drive here. All right. So, if we click view here, we now have the Stormtrooper
1:29:12
playing the banjo in the advertisement, right? So, you can see we've now created that Yodas. All these Yodas are just
1:29:20
dancing around it. We're all having a great time. And you can automate that in one click using that workflow that I've
1:29:26
just used. And so, if you want to generate the images for free, you can. And then you can plug that into a
1:29:31
workflow like this. Now, if you want to get that workflow again, it's inside the AI money lab. Go to the classroom,
1:29:39
scroll down to NA10 automation templates and then you have the templates for
1:29:45
Google AI avatars like so. Just scroll down, grab the resources like this. And
1:29:50
if you want help implementing this stuff, then go over to the AI profit boardroom link in the comments
1:29:55
description and inside here we actually have weekly coaching calls where you can jump on live calls, ask any questions
1:30:01
you have. We have a community where we offer technical support and just help each other grow and learn and that sort
1:30:06
of thing. And then we also have this classroom where we've got all of these different trainings right here. All
1:30:12
right. Now, one of the questions that we got earlier before, let's have a look what we got here. So, we had one here's
1:30:19
an idea of an outfit evaluates your handwriting and recommends a pen to improve your writing. Yes, you could
1:30:25
create that inside Gemini. So, if we go back to Gemini here, and we'll grab that API key again, and I'm going to say,
1:30:32
okay, create an app that evaluates
1:30:38
my handwriting and gives me ideas on how to improve it. Use Google Nano image API
1:30:47
API key equals this. All right. And now it's generating that back in one sec. So now we just have to
1:30:55
upload an image of handwriting. Right? So just as a random example, I'm going to go to Gemini here and say create an
1:31:04
image of someone's messy handwriting. And then we'll use that to test the app
1:31:10
in a second. By the way, I honestly I don't know about anyone watching here,
1:31:15
but for me personally, like I don't even use chat GBT images anymore. It's crazy.
1:31:21
Nano Banana. It came out last week and all of a sudden it's just absolutely dominating. So, we're downloading that
1:31:28
full size now. Here we go. And from here, we're going to go over to our handwriting evaluator that we just
1:31:35
filmed. Upload the image that we just created of the handwriting and then evaluate the handwriting.
1:31:42
And so, it should be able to read images, create images, whatever you want it to do. All right. And then you've got
1:31:48
a full analysis here with the AI based on the handwriting which is pretty cool.
1:31:54
Now the infinite says we need to recommend a pen to buy to improve the
1:31:59
handwriting. So what we can do now is inside the chat here is we'll say okay
1:32:05
and tweak this slightly so that when you give the analysis you also recommend a
1:32:13
pen to improve the handwriting too. So you could use that for example for
1:32:20
affiliate marketing, right? Or even if you had an e-commerce brand that sold pens, you could analyze someone's
1:32:25
handwriting and then recommend the pen that would improve their handwriting and then either you send that via an
1:32:31
affiliate link, right? And people click and buy stuff or you send them to your
1:32:36
store where they can buy that pen as well. It's kind of like a lead generation, traffic generation. So plug
1:32:42
this in. Evaluate the hammerity. And let's see if it works now. And that one
1:32:48
we just got to fix the error. So the more complicated you make this, the more likely it is to break. Yeah, essentially
1:32:55
that's how it works. The blanket says, I tried using Nana Banana to create assets for my brand, but the text is never
1:33:01
accurate. Do you have any recommendations? Yeah, so for text, keep it as simple as possible. One or two
1:33:06
words maximum, and then it should be okay. You can see now it recommends the
1:33:11
type of pen to use. So it's recommended pen type. A gel pen is best suited. Here's why. Blah blah blah. And that
1:33:18
implemented the recommendation that we asked it to like you can see based on the handwriting image. So we'll build
1:33:24
that out the blanket. Yeah. So when it comes to creating brand assets like you
1:33:29
just keep it really simple. I honestly prefer to generate images inside nano without text cuz I still think AR is not
1:33:36
ready for text yet. doesn't seem to be that good unless you're tweaking like one or two letters or something like
1:33:42
that. You want to edit some screenshots and stuff. But yeah, that's basically how it works, my friends. So, just to
1:33:48
recap here, peeps. All right, I've shown you how to build image generation apps for free. I've created some ideas,
1:33:55
including the handwriting evaluator directly on the live stream today using this process. I've shown you the prompts
1:34:02
and how to do it. Shown you how to get a free API key from Google Studio. I also for example showed you how to generate
1:34:08
videos with V3 in one single click using this whole process where the AI scripts
1:34:13
and generates the story line for the video to create something insane like
1:34:19
you can see right here. All right. Pretty cool. Pretty cool. And
1:34:24
then I've also given you the N10 AI agent that can generate images for you
1:34:30
as well. And that's completely free. All right. So, you can get all of this stuff inside the AI money lab link in the
1:34:37
comments description. Let me show you how to get it. So, you go to AI money lab classroom, scroll down, grab the
1:34:45
NA10 templates like you can see right here. And then you can just download and import the JSON files directly into NA10
1:34:52
and tweak them as you need to. As well as that, we also have inside here 50 image generation app ideas like you can
1:34:59
see. And then additionally inside the community here, we have 24,000 members. I actually paid for this community. I
1:35:06
don't charge you to access it. You get it for free. So feel free to get that link in the comments description. Just
1:35:11
posted this crazy case study actually here which was absolutely wild how we made $77,000
1:35:17
with one AI automation. That was crazy. And then also if you want help, if you
1:35:23
want support, if you want to connect with me personally, the only place I connect with people personally is AI profitable. So, if you want to connect
1:35:29
with me, if you want to be able to DM me, if you need help on some feedback or you need some projects you're trying to build, but you're not sure where to
1:35:35
start when it comes to AI automations, feel free to get the AI profit boardroom. Inside there, we actually
1:35:40
give away $1,500 in prizes. Like you can see inside the fire mini challenge that we're running right now exclusively and
1:35:47
only for AI profit members. We also give away tons of stuff inside here. So you can see inside the leaderboards who give
1:35:53
away all this free stuff as free bonuses including a free AI strategy call with
1:35:58
me that you can unlock at level 9. Top of that inside the community here we
1:36:03
just post really cool stuff and we all help and grow together. So you can see that everyone is just learning and
1:36:09
sharing new things together which is absolutely awesome. And then additionally inside the classroom here
1:36:14
you see all these different courses right? So you get so many different courses and different strategies that
1:36:19
you can use for AI automation. If you have no idea where to start, you can start the six week masterass right here.
1:36:25
And you can learn how to build AI agents with NA10 in literally less than 5 minutes. Like you can see, you can also
1:36:31
see the best ways to monetize AI. So we actually run some bonus lessons and
1:36:37
these are like stepby-step very actionable ways to learn AI as well. On
1:36:42
top of that, you know, inside the AI profit boarding community, you also get five live coaching calls per week. So,
1:36:49
you can jump on these calls, ask any questions you have, that sort of thing. And one of the other things that this is
1:36:55
very interesting actually, one of the other things that I find is like a lot of people struggle with overwhelm and shiny object syndrome when it comes to
1:37:02
AI. So, what we actually did is we created the ultimate focus manual,
1:37:08
right? And so, you can just follow this protocol. So if you feel overwhelmed, if you don't know where to start, you feel like your brain's all frazzled and you
1:37:15
don't know, you know, what tool to use when it comes to AI, just follow that focus manual. That alone will get you a
1:37:22
huge ROI, right? So everything inside the community here is designed to help you grow, to improve your results, to
1:37:28
help you learn how to actually monetize and make money with AI automation. And you can get all of this inside the
1:37:35
profit board. Now, there'll be some people watching this and they'll be like, "Do you know what, Julian? I don't
1:37:40
want to do this myself. I'm a busy business owner. I'm not the sort of guy who sets up his own automations." Maybe
1:37:46
you're watching this and you're thinking NA10 is great, but actually setting up the APIs and implementing inside your
1:37:51
business in a practical way is not that useful. And so, if you want us to set it
1:37:56
all up for you to save yourself hundreds of hours, then you can book in an AI automation session for free. Link in the
1:38:04
comments description. Basically, what we're going to do is we're going to look at where you spend your time, build out
1:38:09
the systems that you need to, and you can just hire us as a client to go off and do that stuff for you. Plus, you get
1:38:15
a free welcome gift if you book in that call and become a client. So, feel free to book that in link in the comments
1:38:20
description. You can see all the awesome testimonials and reviews that we have right here. Yeah. And I hope to see you in there. All right. Cheers. Thanks for
1:38:27
watching. What else we got here? Petty Betty says, "Definitely going to rewatch." Thanks, man. Really appreciate
1:38:33
you. Appreciate you too, Betty. Betty. And then Rocky says, "Did you stop using Dia browser?" I did. I did, honestly. I
1:38:40
think for me it was like it was really cool, but everything's in Chrome, isn't it? My Mac is just a Chrome machine.
1:38:46
That's literally I don't use any other programs apart from Chrome. And so if
1:38:51
everything runs in there, then I don't need the browser, right? But the browser is fun and that sort of thing. If you
1:38:57
actually want to know what I'm using currently, let me show you this. So inside the AR profitable boardroom here we have a
1:39:05
updated list of tools that I'm using right now right and so you can see here we actually have a list of tools I
1:39:12
personally use so you don't feel overwhelmed. Basically the goal of this is to essentially show you what tools
1:39:19
I'm using, what tools I don't bother with and that way it's really good because you you save a lot of money on
1:39:27
subscriptions, right? You don't have to pay for 20 tools or 50 tools or whatever and those subscriptions can add up to
1:39:32
thousands of dollars per month up. So if you follow the updated tools list I have inside the AI profit portion then you
1:39:38
can get that directly there. Right? Hope that helps. And then Betty Betty says
1:39:43
lol Chrome is really it for me. I can't break the habit 100%. It's locked in. It's locked in. You can't get rid of it
1:39:50
now. All right. Cheers everyone for watching. See you on the next one. Today I'm going to show you how to rank
1:39:56
number one inside AI search engines like Chat GPT, Perplexity, and Gemini. This is the future of SEO. 99% of your
1:40:04
competitors have no clue this even exists. I've cracked the code on AI optimization. I'm ranking number one for
1:40:10
multiple topics inside these AI models. And I'm about to give you the exact system that is ranking me number one
1:40:16
inside AI search engines. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO
1:40:23
agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the
1:40:28
latest AI updates. Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below. Here's what's crazy. Most people
1:40:34
think SEO is just about Google. But while you're fighting for scraps on Google, I'm dominating inside AI models
1:40:40
where there's zero competition. And the best part, this stuff works in hours, not months. Let me show you proof. When
1:40:46
I search for Perplexity SEO expert inside Perplexity AI, guess what shows
1:40:51
up? My content ranks number one. Not only that, but inside the AI response, it mentions me by name and recommends my
1:40:58
services. This is social proof on steroids. But here's the geeker. Yesterday, when I searched for my tool
1:41:05
inside chat GPT, I was nowhere to be found. Today, number one ranking, and I'm about to show you exactly how I did
1:41:11
it. Here's the truth nobody wants to tell you. Traditional SEO is dying fast. People aren't going to Google anymore.
1:41:18
They're asking chat GPT. They're using perplexity. They're talking to Claude. And if you're not optimizing for AI
1:41:24
search, you're getting left behind. Think about it. When was the last time you Googled something simple? You
1:41:30
probably asked chat GBT instead. That's what everyone's doing now. And this shift is happening faster than you think. The old game was ranking your
1:41:36
website on Google. The new game is getting AI models to recommend you as the expert. It's not about keywords
1:41:41
anymore. It's about topics. It's not about your website anymore. It's about your brand. Here's what most people don't understand. AI search engines work
1:41:48
completely different than Google. Google shows you a list of websites. AI gives you one answer and inside that answer,
1:41:55
there's only room for one expert, one recommendation, one brand. That's why this is such a massive opportunity.
1:42:00
Instead of competing with 10 results on page one of Google, you're competing to be the one expert mentioned inside the
1:42:05
AI response. Winner takes all. But wait, there's more. AI doesn't just look at your website. It looks at everything. your YouTube videos, your social posts,
1:42:12
your podcast appearances, your brand mentions, everything gets fed into the
1:42:18
AI brain. And when someone asks a question, AI picks the most trusted expert. That expert could be you, but
1:42:24
only if you know the system. Let me break down the exact system I use to rank inside AI models. This is what took
1:42:30
my brand new website from invisible to number one in 8 hours. Step one, get indexed on Bing. This is the secret
1:42:37
nobody's talking about. Chat GPT search and Bing are connected. When you get
1:42:42
indexed on Bing, you automatically get considered for Chat GPT search results. Most people ignore Bing completely. Big
1:42:49
mistake. Bing is now the gateway to AI search rankings. Here's what you do. Go to Bing
1:42:56
web master tools. Add your website. Submit your site map. Get indexed fast.
1:43:01
I did this for my new site 8 hours ago. Within hours, I was ranking number one inside chat GPT. The connection is real
1:43:09
and it's powerful. But here's what's even crazier. While everyone's fighting for Google rankings that take months,
1:43:15
I'm getting Bing rankings in hours. And those Bing rankings feed directly into
1:43:20
AI search results. Step two, build topic authority. Forget keywords. AI doesn't
1:43:25
think in keywords. It thinks in topics. Instead of targeting beast productivity calculator, think about productivity as
1:43:32
a topic. Cover every angle, answer every question, become the go-to source. This is where most people mess up. They
1:43:38
create one piece of content and expect to rank. That's not how AI works. AI looks for comprehensive coverage. It
1:43:44
wants to see you talking about the topic everywhere. YouTube videos, blog posts, social media, podcasts. The more places
1:43:51
AI finds you talking about your topic, the more it trusts you as the expert. And here's the thing, AI is smart. It
1:43:58
can connect the dots. If you're talking about productivity on YouTube, writing about it on LinkedIn, and building tools
1:44:04
around it on your website, AI starts to see you as the productivity expert. Before we go further, if you want to
1:44:10
master AI SEO and join hundreds of others getting results, check out SEO Elite Circle. We share the latest AI SEO
1:44:17
strategies that are working right now. Step three, create brand mentions. This is the game changer. AI doesn't just
1:44:23
look at your website. It looks at what other people are saying about you. brand mentions, case studies, reviews, social
1:44:30
proof. When other people mention your brand in connection with your topic, AI takes notice. It starts associating you
1:44:36
with that topic. And eventually, when someone asks about that topic, AI recommends you. But how do you get brand
1:44:41
mentions? Here's what I do. I share my results. I show my case studies. I help people for free. When you provide real
1:44:48
value, people naturally start talking about you. And AI picks up on all of it. Let me show you exactly what I did. I
1:44:55
created a brand new website using bolt new. This tool lets you build entire websites with AI in minutes. The code is
1:45:01
clean. The site loads fast and it's optimized for AI indexing. Here's the crazy part. I used an exact match
1:45:07
domain. If I'm targeting best productivity calculator, my domain includes those exact words. This tells
1:45:13
AI exactly what my website is about. Then I created a functional tool, not just content. Tools rank better than
1:45:19
articles because they provide real value. People actually use them and AI can see that engagement. The website was
1:45:25
built with clean code. No messy WordPress plugins, no slow loading times, just pure fast functional code
1:45:32
that AI can easily understand and index. And it worked. 8 hours later, I'm
1:45:37
ranking number one inside chat GPT for my target topic. Here's what you need to understand. The future of SEO isn't
1:45:44
about ranking websites. It's about ranking brands. When someone asks AI for an expert, you want to be the name that
1:45:50
comes up. This means being everywhere. YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, podcasts, guest posts. The more places
1:45:57
AI finds your content, the stronger your brand authority becomes. I call this omnipresent marketing. Instead of
1:46:03
putting all your eggs in one basket, you spread your content across multiple platforms. When AI searches for
1:46:08
information on your topic, it finds you everywhere. But here's the key. You can't just copy and paste the same content everywhere. Each platform needs
1:46:15
unique content that serves that platform's audience. But all of it should point back to your expertise. One
1:46:21
powerful strategy is creating case studies around the topics you want to rank for. When I talk about my results
1:46:26
using specific tools or strategies, AI picks up on that and associates me with those topics. For example, when AI
1:46:33
searches for information about AI SEO tools, it finds my case studies showing real results. This positions me as the
1:46:40
expert who's actually using and testing these tools. Case studies are social proof on steroids. They show you're not
1:46:47
just talking theory, you're showing real results. And AI values that authenticity. Think about it. Anyone can
1:46:52
write an article about productivity tips. But if you show a case study of how you helped someone increase their
1:46:58
productivity by 50%, that's way more valuable. And AI knows it. Here's something technical that matters. AI
1:47:04
prefers clean code. When I built my site with bolt new, the code was simple and fast. Compare that to a messy WordPress
1:47:11
site with tons of plugins and there's no contest. Clean code loads faster. It's easier for AI to crawl and understand,
1:47:18
and it provides a better user experience. All of these factors help with AI rankings. If you're using
1:47:23
WordPress, clean up your code, remove unnecessary plugins, optimize your images, make your site as fast and clean
1:47:30
as possible. But honestly, if you really want to dominate AI search, consider building a new site with clean code from
1:47:37
scratch. The difference is night and day. Here's a key insight. Tools rank
1:47:42
better than articles in AI search. Why? Because tools provide immediate value.
1:47:47
People actually use them. And AI can see that engagement and utility. Instead of writing another how-to article, create a
1:47:53
calculator, build a tool, make something interactive. This not only ranks better, but also converts visitors into
1:47:59
customers. Tools are also more AI proof. While AI can easily replaceformational content, it can't replace functional
1:48:06
tools that solve specific problems. Think about your niche. What tool could you build that would help your audience? A calculator, a generator, a checker.
1:48:13
Build it. make it useful and watch it rank. You can't just rely on your website anymore. AI pulls information
1:48:19
from everywhere. YouTube videos, social media posts, forum discussions, podcast
1:48:24
transcripts. The more platforms you're on, the more opportunities AI has to find and recommend you. But this isn't
1:48:30
about posting the same content everywhere. It's about creating platform specific content that all points back to
1:48:35
your expertise. On YouTube, create video tutorials. On LinkedIn, share industry
1:48:41
insights. on Twitter, engage in conversations, on your podcast, interview experts. Each piece of content
1:48:48
should be valuable on its own, but together they build your authority. And here's what's amazing. AI connects all
1:48:54
these pieces. It sees you as the common thread across all these platforms. And that builds massive authority in AI's
1:48:59
eyes. Don't try to game the system with lowquality content. AI is smart. It can tell the difference between valuable
1:49:04
content and spam. Focus on creating genuinely helpful content that solves real problems. One amazing piece of
1:49:10
content that ranks in AI is worth more than a hundred mediocre articles that get ignored. Quality always wins. But
1:49:16
what makes content quality in AI's eyes? It's not just about grammar and spelling. It's about value. Does your
1:49:22
content solve a real problem? Does it provide actionable insights? Does it help people achieve their goals? If yes,
1:49:28
AI will reward it. If no, AI will ignore it. This isn't some future prediction.
1:49:34
This is happening right now. People are already using AI for search more than Google. And that trend is only
1:49:39
accelerating. The businesses that adapt now will dominate. The ones that wait will get left behind. It's that simple.
1:49:46
AI search is only going to get bigger. More platforms, more users, more opportunities. The time to act is now
1:49:52
while there's still low competition and massive opportunity. Start with one AI platform, master it, then expand to
1:49:58
others. Build your AI SEO system step by step and watch as you dominate topics in
1:50:04
your niche. The businesses that understand this shift and act on it now will have a massive advantage. While
1:50:09
everyone else is fighting for Google rankings, you'll be the AI recommended expert in your field. Google's dominance
1:50:15
is ending. AI's dominance is beginning, and you can either ride this wave or get crushed by it. Don't wait. Don't
1:50:21
overthink it. Start building your AI SEO presence today. The future of search is here, and it's time to claim your spot

1:51:37
insane for free. Today, I'm going to blow your mind with something that just dropped. Google just released a coder
1:51:42
that builds apps in seconds, and it's completely free. I tested it with photo editing and games. The results are
1:51:49
absolutely crazy. You're not going to believe what this thing can do. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital
1:51:55
avatar of of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency, Goldie Agency. Whilst he's
1:52:01
helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. I just spent hours
1:52:08
testing Google's new Gemini Coder. What I found changes everything for people who want to build apps but don't know
1:52:13
how to code. You just tell it what you want, and it builds professional apps in minutes. Let me show you exactly what
1:52:19
happened. First test, I'm going to ask it to build me an AI photo editing app using Nano Banana. I type in the request
1:52:26
and hit enter. Now, while this is building, here's what's crazy. Most photo editing apps take teams of
1:52:32
developers months to create. You need image processing, user interfaces, upload systems, AI integration, and it
1:52:40
just built the entire thing in 30 seconds. Look at this. Clean interface, upload functionality, text, prompt box,
1:52:47
results display. This looks like a professional app. you pay for. But now comes the real test. I'm uploading a
1:52:52
picture of myself holding my AI link building book. I'm asking it to add a cute dog beside me. While it's
1:52:58
processing this, let me explain why this is insane. Photo editing with AI requires understanding lighting,
1:53:04
shadows, proportions, and background matching. This usually needs specialized software and skills. And look at that
1:53:09
result. The dog looks completely natural. The lighting matches perfectly. You can't tell it was added after. Let me try something harder. I'm asking for
1:53:16
a Persian cat instead. Again, while this process is think about what's happening, the AI has to analyze my photo,
1:53:23
understand the background, match the lighting conditions, and seamlessly blend in a realistic cat. Perfect. The
1:53:29
cat looks like it was there when I took the photo. But here's where it gets crazy. Look at these suggestions. It's giving me add sideby-side comparisons,
1:53:36
quality settings for standard versus higher processing. I just built a professional photo editing tool in 5
1:53:42
minutes with zero coding. Test two, Space Invaders game. I'm typing the request now. While this builds, games
1:53:49
are way more complex than most people think. You need graphics rendering, collision detection, user input
1:53:55
handling, scoring systems, animations. 30 seconds later, and look at this.
1:54:01
Complete Space Invaders game. Visual effects, explosions, animated sprites,
1:54:06
scoring system. I'm actually playing it right now. This is genuinely fun. But watch this. It's giving me improvement
1:54:11
suggestions. add level difficulty, better animations, more effects. I'm clicking on level difficulty now. While
1:54:18
it implements this, here's what's happening behind the scenes. It's modifying game speed, enemy patterns,
1:54:23
spawn rates. This is advanced game development stuff. Done. Now, the game gets harder as you progress. Adding
1:54:29
better animations. Now, see how smooth the invader movement is. Now, this looks professionally made. One more. Adding
1:54:34
visual effects. Look at those explosion effects. This game could be in the app store. Total time to build this under an
1:54:41
hour. No coding experience needed. Here's what this means for you. I run a seven figureure agency, but I'm not a
1:54:47
developer yet. I just built two commercial apps in one afternoon. People pay monthly subscriptions for photo editors. Games make billions in revenue.
1:54:56
And I built both with simple text prompts. Now, while you're thinking about what you could build, let me show
1:55:01
you why this tool is different. First, it's completely free. No subscriptions, no limits. Second, it's connected to
1:55:09
Google's AI infrastructure. That's enterprise level technology available to anyone. Third, the suggestions it gives
1:55:16
actually improve your apps. These aren't random ideas. They're based on what makes apps successful. But here's the
1:55:22
key. This technology is moving fast. Google just released Gemini 2.0 and Nano
1:55:28
Banana within weeks of each other. Most people don't even know these exist yet. While your competitors are still using
1:55:33
basic AI tools, you could be building apps with Google's most advanced models. This is like having access to the
1:55:39
internet before most people knew what a website was. First mover advantage is massive. Speaking of building profitable
1:55:45
businesses with AI, you need to check out my AI money lab. Over 20,000 members
1:55:50
are using these strategies to save hundreds of hours and make more money. I post new tutorials every day covering
1:55:56
the latest AI releases like Gemini 2.0 and Nano Banana. Complete step-by-step
1:56:01
processes for every new tool. Link in the comments and description. Now, let me show you something most people miss.
1:56:06
I'm going to break down exactly why this changes everything for business owners. Look at the code it generated for my
1:56:12
photo editor. I'm viewing the source right now. This is clean, optimized code with proper error handling, responsive
1:56:18
design, and security features built in. A freelance developer would charge $5,000 to $10,000 to build this, and it
1:56:25
would take them weeks. But here's what's really insane. The AI didn't just copy existing code. It created custom
1:56:31
solutions specific to my request. The image processing pipeline is optimized for Nanoban's API. The user interface
1:56:38
adapts to different screen sizes. The error messages are userfriendly. This is bespoke software development happening
1:56:44
in real time. Let me test something else. I'm asking it to add image filters to the photo editor. Watch this. It's
1:56:49
adding vintage filters, black and white conversion, brightness adjustments, professional photo editing features that
1:56:56
apps like VSCO charge premium subscriptions for. Total time 15 seconds. Now, let me show you the
1:57:02
business implications. I'm going to check what similar apps make in revenue. Photo editing apps in the app store
1:57:08
average $2 to5 for one-time purchases. Premium subscriptions run $10 to $30 per
1:57:14
month. The top photo editing apps make millions per year. My app has better AI than most paid apps. It's using Google's
1:57:21
latest image generation model. That's a competitive advantage worth millions. But it gets better. Let me test the
1:57:26
scaling potential. I'm asking it to add batch processing, the ability to edit multiple photos at once. Done.
1:57:32
Enterprise feature implemented in seconds. Now I'm adding user accounts and save history. Look at that. User
1:57:38
authentication, cloud storage integration, session management, features that require backend infrastructure, and database design.
1:57:45
This tool just built me a scalable enterprise ready application with features that compete with Adobe
1:57:50
products. Think about this from a business perspective. Adobe makes $20 billion per year selling creative
1:57:56
software. Canva is valued at $40 billion. Pixar has over 1 billion downloads. The barrier to entry in this
1:58:02
market just disappeared. Anyone can now build competitive photo editing tools using Google's most advanced AI. But
1:58:09
here's the part that really matters. I'm not just building one app. I can build dozens. Let me test something completely
1:58:15
different. I'm asking for a choir code generator. 30 seconds later, professional quiet generator. Custom
1:58:22
colors, logos, download options. Apps like this sell for $3 to5 or run ads for
1:58:29
revenue. Now a barcode scanner done. Camera integration, realtime scanning,
1:58:34
product lookup. This could be a standalone business. The speed of iteration is what changes everything. In
1:58:40
the time it used to take to plan one app, I can build and test different ideas. And each one is using Google's
1:58:46
enterprise AI infrastructure. You're getting technology that normally requires massive teams and budgets. But
1:58:52
let me address the elephant in the room. Some people are thinking this is too good to be true. Where's the catch? The
1:58:57
catch is adoption speed. This technology is so new that most people don't know it exists. By the time everyone figures
1:59:02
this out, the first movers will have huge advantages. Right now, there are maybe a few thousand people worldwide
1:59:08
who understand how to use Gemini Koda. Effectively, in 6 months, there will be
1:59:13
millions. The opportunity window is right now. Let me show you specific niches where this creates instant
1:59:19
opportunities. Local businesses need simple apps. restaurant ordering systems, appointment booking, customer
1:59:25
loyalty programs. These apps usually cost five to$15,000 to develop. You can build them in hours. E-commerce
1:59:32
businesses need product tools, image editors for product photos, inventory management, customer service bots. Each
1:59:39
one is a potential recurring revenue stream. Content creators need specialized tools, video thumbnail
1:59:44
generators, social media schedulers, analytics, dashboards. These tools have built-in audiences who pay monthly
1:59:51
subscriptions. The key is thinking beyond just building apps. Think about building app businesses. Here's what I'm
1:59:57
doing personally. I'm building a portfolio of micro apps. Each one targets a specific problem for a
2:00:03
specific audience. Some will fail, but the ones that work will generate passive income. Because remember, these aren't
2:00:09
just simple apps. They're powered by Google's most advanced AI. They can compete with apps that have million-doll
2:00:15
development budgets. Let me address something. Some people think this sounds too good to be true. I get it. But I
2:00:21
showed you the real results. The photo editor that added realistic pets to my pictures. The game with professional
2:00:27
graphics and smooth animations. This isn't marketing hype. These are actual results. And this technology only gets
2:00:33
better. What I showed you is just the beginning. In 6 months, these tools will be more powerful. In a year, they'll do
2:00:38
things we can barely imagine. But the people who start now will have huge advantages. So here's what you do next.
2:00:45
Step one, go try this yourself. Don't just watch. Actually build something. Step two, start simple. Photo editor or
2:00:52
basic game like I did. Step three, use the improvement suggestions. They make your apps better. Step four, think
2:00:58
bigger once you get comfortable. Apps that solve real problems. Apps people would pay for. This isn't just about
2:01:03
building apps. This is about building the future where anyone can create professional software. You can be part of that future or watch from the
2:01:10
sidelines. If you want my help, I've got three ways to support you. First, if you want to scale your business and save
2:01:16

2:01:40
lab. 20,000 members are already using these strategies. link in comments and description. Julian Goldie reads every
2:01:46
comment. So, let me know what you're going to build first. Photo editor like I did. Simple game, something completely
2:01:52
different. The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is right now. Go build something amazing. New
2:01:58
Gemini 2.5 flash image update is insane and free. Today, I'm going to show you
2:02:05
Google's brand new Gemini 2.5 flash image update that just dropped yesterday. This thing is absolutely
2:02:12
crazy. We're talking about AI that can edit your photos better. It can remove people from pictures with just words. It
2:02:19
can blend multiple photos into one perfect image. And here's the best part. It costs almost nothing to use, less
2:02:25
than 4 cents per image. But there's something even more insane about this update that nobody is talking about yet.
2:02:30
So yesterday, Google dropped something that's about to change everything. It's called Gemini 2.5 Flash image. But
2:02:37
here's what's crazy. This thing was leaked weeks ago under a secret code name. They called it nano banana. People
2:02:42
were testing it on these underground AI forms and it was crushing every other AI image model out there. Now Google
2:02:48
finally released it officially and the results are insane. This is not like anything we've seen before. This AI
2:02:54
doesn't just make pictures. It understands what you want. It thinks about your request. Then it creates
2:02:59
exactly what you ask for. Let me show you what this thing can do. I tested this myself with a busy street scene
2:03:05
that had people walking around and a small dog in the foreground. I simply told it to remove the people in the
2:03:10
background. The result was perfect. Clean street scene with just the dog remaining. Perfect lighting. No weird
2:03:16
artifacts. No obvious signs of editing. The shadows and reflections all look completely natural, like those people
2:03:22
were never there in the first place. But that's just the beginning. Here's where it gets really wild. This AI can blend
2:03:28
multiple photos into one. So you have a picture of your dog and a picture of you. You can tell it, "Put my dog and me
2:03:34
on the basketball court cuddling." And it creates a perfect photo that looks completely real. Most AI image tools
2:03:41
struggle with faces. They make weird distortions. Eyes that don't match, teeth that look like fangs. But this new
2:03:47
Gemini model, it keeps faces perfect every time because it's built on something Google calls their world
2:03:53
knowledge system. This AI knows what humans actually look like. It knows how shadows work, how lighting affects skin,
2:04:00
how clothes fold and move. Here's something most people don't know yet. This AI can maintain character consistency across multiple edits. I
2:04:08
tested this with a simple image generation. First prompt, image of a girl holding a cake. Perfect birthday
2:04:14
photo. Then I said, now the girl just tripped. Same exact girl, same face, same features, but now showing the
2:04:20
moment of the accident with motion blur and the cake falling. This is huge for content creators who want to create the
2:04:25
same character in different scenes. And the editing capabilities are insane. You can change shirt colors with just words.
2:04:32
You can blur backgrounds like a pro photographer. You can remove stains from clothes. You can even add color to old
2:04:38
black and white photos, all with natural language commands. But here's what nobody's talking about yet, the pricing.
2:04:43
This thing costs $3.9 per image. Let me put that in perspective. Professional photo editing services charge anywhere
2:04:50
from $ 20 to $100 per edited photo. Freelance photo editors on Fiverr charge
2:04:55
at least $5 per basic edit, but this AI less than 4 cents and it's often better
2:05:00
quality than human editors. Now, here's something really interesting. Google gave this model a secret code name
2:05:06
during development, Nano Banana. And it was dominating the LaMarina leaderboards for weeks before anyone knew what it
2:05:12
was. Ella Marina is where AI researchers test and compare different models. And
2:05:17
this mystery nano banana model was crushing GPT4 claude and every other
2:05:23
image AI out there. And people were going crazy trying to figure out what nano banana was. Some thought it was a
2:05:29
new open AI model. Others thought it was anthropic testing something in secret. But it was Google all along and they
2:05:35
were probably testing it in the wild to see how good it really was compared to the competition. And speaking of competition, this thing is beating
2:05:43
everything. According to the latest benchmarks, Gemini 2.5 flash image is number one for prompt adherence. That
2:05:50
means it actually creates what you ask for, not some weird interpretation, not something close, exactly what you want.
2:05:57
Now, let me tell you something that's going to blow your mind. This isn't just about making pretty pictures. This AI
2:06:02
understands context. It has what Google calls semantic understanding. And I just
2:06:08
tested this myself right before making this video. I uploaded a basic photo and gave it a simple prompt. Just said,
2:06:15
"Have her hold the bag in Paris." That's it. No complex instructions, no
2:06:20
technical language, just a simple sentence. What came back was insane.
2:06:25
Professional fashion photography that looks like it costs $500 to shoot. Perfect golden hour lighting, authentic
2:06:32
Parisian street scene with the Eiffel Tower, realistic shadows, and depth of field. The outfit styling was cohesive.
2:06:39
The pose looked natural. Everything fit together perfectly. This single image would cost $200 to $500 from a
2:06:44
professional photographer. It took seconds to create and cost 4 cents. This is not an exaggeration. This is exactly
2:06:51
what happened. But here's what's really crazy. The AI understood what in Paris meant. It knew to put her on cobblestone
2:06:58
streets. It knew to include classic Parisian architecture. It even got the lighting right for that golden hour
2:07:04
Paris aesthetic. This is world knowledge in action. So if you show it a hand-drawn diagram and ask it to turn it
2:07:09
into a professional infographic, it can do that. If you give it a sketch of a business idea and ask it to create
2:07:15
marketing materials, it can understand the concept and create exactly what you need. And here's another crazy feature.
2:07:20
You can use this for educational content. If you have handwritten notes or diagrams, the AI can read them,
2:07:26
understand them, and turn them into professional teaching materials. This is perfect for course creators and educators. But wait, there's more. This
2:07:34
AI can maintain brand consistency. So if you have a specific style or color
2:07:39
scheme for your business, you can tell the AI to apply that style to all your images. Every social media post, every
2:07:46
marketing material, every piece of content will have the same professional look. Real estate agents are using this
2:07:51
to enhance property photos. I tested this too with an empty room. Simple prompt. Transform this empty room into a
2:07:58
beautifully staged living room with modern furniture, warm lighting, and tasteful decor. The result looked like a
2:08:04
$20,000 staging job. Perfect furniture placement, coordinated color scheme,
2:08:09
professional lighting, the kind of staging that normally costs thousands and takes weeks to set up. This helps
2:08:14
properties sell faster and for higher prices. If you want to see exactly how to use AI tools like this to build a
2:08:20
profitable business, I've got something special for you. There's a link in the comments and description to the AI Money
2:08:25
Lab. This is where I share all my latest strategies for making money with AI tools. We've got over 19,000 members now
2:08:31
learning how to scale their businesses with AI automation. Inside the AI money
2:08:37
lab, you'll get access to over a 100 different use cases for AI tools, step-by-step tutorials, templates, and
2:08:44
prompts, and you'll see exactly how tools like Gemini 2.5 Flash image can generate income for your business. Now,
2:08:51
here's where this gets really strategic. Google built this on their Gemini 2.5 platform. That's their most advanced AI
2:08:58
system. It's not just an image generator. It's a thinking AI that can reason through complex requests. So,
2:09:04
when you ask it to edit a photo, it's actually analyzing the entire image, understanding the context, and making
2:09:09
intelligent decisions about how to make the changes look natural. And Google made it incredibly easy to use. You can
2:09:14
access it through their API if you're a developer. You can use Google AI Studio if you want a simple interface, or you
2:09:21
can use Vertex AI if you're running this for a business. They even created template apps so you can start using it
2:09:26
immediately without any technical knowledge. Here's something really cool. Google AI Studio now has what they call
2:09:32
build mode. You can create custom photo editing apps with just a simple prompt. So you could say, "Build me an image
2:09:39
editing app that lets users upload photos and apply vintage filters and the
2:09:44
AI will build that app for you. Then you can deploy it or save the code to use later." This is perfect for agencies.
2:09:49
You can create custom tools for your clients. You can white label these apps. You can charge clients monthly fees for
2:09:56
access to these tools. The business opportunities are massive. Here's another crazy feature that most people haven't figured out yet. You can use
2:10:02
this for iterative editing. This means you can refine images step by step until they're exactly what you want. Instead
2:10:09
of creating one design and hoping it works, you can create dozens of variations instantly. Different colors,
2:10:15
different styles, different layouts, then test them all to see what converts best. The new model is instant and
2:10:21
cheap. Tell the AI what you want. Get perfect results in seconds. Make unlimited changes. Pay almost nothing.
2:10:29
This is not just an improvement. This is a complete transformation of how visual content gets created. Now, here's where
2:10:34
this gets really interesting from a technical perspective. This AI includes something called synth ID watermarking.
2:10:40
Every image it creates has an watermark that proves it was made by AI. This is important for legal and ethical reasons,
2:10:46
but it's also smart business practice. As AI generated content becomes more common, there are going to be
2:10:52
regulations about disclosing when content is created by AI. With Symphod, you're automatically compliant. Now,
2:10:58
here's something important about timing. We're at the very beginning of this AI revolution in visual content. Most
2:11:04
businesses haven't figured this out yet. Most of your competitors are still doing things the old way. This is your
2:11:10
opportunity to get a massive head start. The businesses that adopt this technology now will have a huge
2:11:15
advantage over those that wait. better looking content, faster turnaround times, lower costs, higher profit
2:11:21
margins, and the ability to test and iterate at a speed that was never possible before. But this window won't
2:11:27
last forever. As more people discover these tools, the advantage will decrease. The early adopters will be the
2:11:34
big winners. The late adopters will struggle to catch up. So, here's my recommendation. Start experimenting with
2:11:40
this immediately. Don't wait. Don't overthink it. Just start creating images and see what's possible. The learning
2:11:46
curve is minimal, but the potential impact on your business is massive. And remember, this is just the beginning.
2:11:52
Google is constantly improving their AI models. Gemini 2.5 flash image is already incredible, but it's going to
2:11:58
get even better. The quality will improve. The features will expand. The integration options will multiply. By
2:12:05
starting now, you'll be ahead of the curve when these improvements happen. You'll already have experience with the tools. You'll already have workflows
2:12:12
established. you'll already be seeing results while others are just getting started. Now, before we wrap up, I want
2:12:17

2:14:47
comment and I love hearing about your success stories and challenges. This is an incredible time to be building a
2:14:54
business and I'm excited to see what you create with these new tools. Today, I'm going to show you something huge that
2:14:59
Google might be secretly working on. We're talking about Gemini 3.0 rumors and leaks. This could be the biggest AI
2:15:05
update ever. If these rumors are true, Google might be about to drop something that will change everything. The leaks
2:15:11
are crazy. The clues are everywhere and you need to see this right now. But first, let me be completely transparent with you. This video covers unconfirmed
2:15:17
leaks and rumors about Gemini 3.0. All information is based on public speculation, code discoveries, and
2:15:24
industry rumors. Nothing is officially confirmed by Google yet. Everything could change once Google actually
2:15:29
announces the model. So, keep that in mind as we go through this. So, here's what happened. Uh, Google employees started posting weird stuff on social
2:15:35
media, like really weird stuff. Simon from Google posted a picture of a single banana on a plate. Just a banana. Then
2:15:41
Patrick Loba said something about a very a peeling week ahead. These guys don't post random fruit pictures for no
2:15:47
reason. But wait, it gets better. This appears to be actual code showing references to something called Gemini
2:15:52
Beta 3.0 Pro. Now, this could be real code in Google systems or it could be
2:15:58
something else entirely. We can't be 100% sure until Google confirms it. But if it's real, this suggests Gemini 3.0
2:16:05
Zero might actually be in development. The evidence is mounting, but remember this is all still speculation. And here's where it gets really wild.
2:16:11
There's this mysterious AI called Nano Banana that suddenly appeared in August. Nobody knows where it came from. It's
2:16:17
not officially announced, but it's crushing everything else in blind tests. People are editing images with simple
2:16:22
text commands. The results are mind-blowing. According to user reports, this thing might be able to do complex multi-step edits. One report claims
2:16:30
someone told it to turn bottom character into 2B from near automata and top character into Master Chief from Halo,
2:16:35
and it supposedly handled it well. But these are just user reports we're seeing online. We can't verify these claims independently. And here's what most
2:16:41
people don't understand. Google isn't just building a better chatbot. They're building an AI ecosystem. This is Gemini
2:16:47
running on your phone, your computer, your smart home devices. It's everywhere at once, always learning, always
2:16:52
helping, always one step ahead. The alleged leaked benchmarks are interesting if they're real. Some unverified reports claim Gemini 3.0
2:17:00
might have scored 32.4% on something called humanity's last exam. For comparison, rumors put GPT5 at 26.5%.
2:17:07
But here's the thing. We have no way to verify these numbers. They could be completely made up. They could be from
2:17:12
early test versions. They could be measuring something totally different until Google releases official benchmarks. Treat these numbers as pure
2:17:20
speculation. But wait, there's more. Remember that Kingfall model I
2:17:25
mentioned? Industry insiders think this might be an early version of Gemini 3.0.
2:17:30
Or maybe it's a special version with something called Deep Think built in. Either way, it's performing at levels
2:17:36
nobody expected. Deep Think is Google's answer to advanced reasoning. Instead of just giving you an answer, it thinks
2:17:41
through the problem step by step. It considers multiple options. It checks its work. It gives you better answers
2:17:46
because it's actually reasoning, not just pattern matching. Now, here's what industry speculation suggests might happen next. Some analysts think Google
2:17:52
could announce Gemini 3.0 zero in November or December based on past patents. The rumors suggest they might
2:17:58
start with a preview for enterprise users. Then maybe early 2026, everyone could get access. Some prediction
2:18:04
markets suggest 75% chance of announcement between September and November. But remember, these are just
2:18:09
predictions based on speculation. Google could announce next week or they could wait until 2026. We really don't know.
2:18:17
The social media hints could mean something big is coming soon or Google employees could just be having fun with
2:18:22
the AI community. We won't know until Google actually says something official. The enterprise preview will probably hit
2:18:28
in December. That's when big companies get first access. They'll test it on real world problems, iron out the bugs,
2:18:34
figure out the best use cases. Then early 2026, the rest of us get to play. But here's a secret that most people
2:18:40
missed. The nano banana model. It's not separate from Gemini 3.0. It's probably
2:18:45
part of the image editing features. Think about it. Google has been working on multimodal AI for years. They want
2:18:51
one model that handles text, images, audio, video, everything. Nano banana showing up right when Gemini 3.0 leaks
2:18:58
start happening. That's not coincidence. That's coordination. Google is testing pieces of Gemini 3.0 in isolation,
2:19:04
seeing how well they work, getting feedback, then they'll put it all together for the big reveal. And let me
2:19:10
tell you something about those benchmark scores on humanity's last exam might not
2:19:15
sound impressive, but this test is designed to be nearly impossible. It covers the absolute frontier of human
2:19:21
knowledge. Most humans would score near zero. So 32.4% means this AI knows things that 99.9% of people don't know.
2:19:28
But here's what excites me most, the integration possibilities. Imagine Gemini 3.0 running on your Android
2:19:35
phone. You're at a restaurant. You point your camera at the menu. It instantly translates everything, checks reviews, suggests dishes based on your dietary
2:19:41
restrictions, maybe even makes the order for you in the local language. Or you're working on a project. You sketch out an
2:19:46
idea. Gemini 3.0 zero sees it, understands it, and starts building the actual product. Code, designs,
2:19:53
documentation, everything. Now, you might be wondering, how do I prepare for this? How do I make sure I'm ready when
2:19:58
Gemini 3.0 drops? Great question, and that brings me to something important. If you want to stay ahead of the AI
2:20:05
curve and learn how to actually make money with these tools, check out the AI money lab. I've got the link in the
2:20:10
comments and description. Inside, you'll find step-by-step training on how to use AI tools like Gemini to grow your
2:20:15
business, increase your income, and stay competitive. The AI Money Lab has 19,000 members who are already using AI to
2:20:22
transform their lives. Every day, I share new tutorials, case studies, and strategies. Plus, you get access to all
2:20:28
my premium training and a community of like-minded entrepreneurs. But back to Gemini 3.0. Here's what we know for
2:20:34
sure. Google is working on it. The code references prove it. The employee hints confirm it. The timing suggests
2:20:39
announcement within three months. The implications are staggering. Think about content creation. Instead of spending hours writing and editing, you describe
2:20:46
what you want and Gemini creates it. Perfect grammar, perfect tone, perfect for your audience. Think about coding.
2:20:52
Instead of debugging for hours, Gemini spots the problem instantly and fixes it. Instead of writing boilerplate code,
2:20:58
you describe the function and it builds the entire thing. Think about business operations. Customer service handled by
2:21:04
AI that actually understands context and emotion. marketing campaigns that adapt in real time based on performance.
2:21:10
Financial analysis that spots trends humans miss. Now, here's something most people don't realize. The Gemini 3.0
2:21:16
announcement isn't just about Google. It's going to force every other AI company to respond. Open AAI will probably accelerate GBT5. Anthropic
2:21:23
might rush out clawed updates. Microsoft will scramble to keep C-Pilot competitive. But here's the thing, features don't matter if you don't know
2:21:29
how to use them. Having access to the best AI means nothing if you don't have the skills to leverage it effectively.
2:21:35
That's the gap most people miss. The smart move is to start learning AI systems now before Gemini 3.0 drops,
2:21:42
before the competition heats up, before everyone else realizes what's happening. Get comfortable with prompting techniques. Learn workflow automation.
2:21:50
Understand how to integrate AI into your daily work. Build systems that scale. That's how you'll be ready when the next
2:21:56
wave hits. And speaking of being ready, if you want personalized help with your SEO and digital marketing strategy, I'm
2:22:01
offering free SEO strategy sessions. These are one-on-one calls where we'll analyze your website, identify
2:22:07
opportunities, and create a plan to get you more traffic and customers. The link for booking your free session is in the
2:22:14
comments and description. These sessions usually book up fast, so grab yours while they're available. But let's get
2:22:19
back to the Gemini 3.0 implications. One thing that excites me is the potential
2:22:25
for small businesses. Right now, advanced AI capabilities are expensive. You need technical knowledge. You need
2:22:32
big budgets. And based on these leaks, we're probably just three months away from that transformation beginning. Are
2:22:37
you ready? Here's what I recommend. First, start experimenting with current AI tools. Get comfortable with the basics. Learn prompt engineering.
2:22:44
Understand how to chain different AI operations together. Second, think about your business or career goals. Where
2:22:50
could AI make the biggest impact? What tasks take the most time? What skills do you wish you had? Start planning how AI
2:22:56
could fill those gaps. Third, stay informed. Follow the developments. Watch for updates. When Gemini 3.0 zero drops.
2:23:03
You want to be among the first to try it. First mover advantage is real in the AI space. And fourth, consider joining a
2:23:09
community of people who are serious about AI. The AI money lab isn't just training. It's a network. Members share
2:23:14
discoveries, collaborate on projects, and help each other succeed. When major updates drop, like Gemini 3.0, having a
2:23:21
community makes all the difference. Instead of figuring everything out alone, you learn from people who have already tested the new features. You
2:23:28
avoid common mistakes. You get better results faster. The link is in the comments and description. Check it out if you're serious about staying ahead of
2:23:34
the AI curve. Now, here's my prediction for what might happen next, but remember, this is pure speculation.
2:23:39
Google might announce Gemini 3.0 in November if the rumors are true. Maybe enterprise preview in December, possibly
2:23:46
public launch in February or March 2026, but pieces of it could start appearing earlier, according to some theories.
2:23:52
Maybe Nano Banana becomes officially available. Maybe agent mode gets previewed in Google Workspace. Or maybe
2:23:58
none of this happens and Google goes in a completely different direction. The key thing to remember is that we're working with limited information here.
2:24:04
Code references, social media hints, and industry speculation. Until Google makes an official announcement, everything
2:24:10
we've talked about today could change completely. That's how you win in the AI game. Not by waiting for official announcements, by paying attention to
2:24:17
the signals, the code commits, the employee hints, the mysterious models appearing in TE environments. And here's
2:24:22
something else to consider. If Gemini 3.0 really is as advanced as these leaks suggest, it's going to create massive
2:24:28
opportunities for content creators, marketers, and entrepreneurs. If you want to make sure you're in the first group, check out the AI Money Lab.
2:24:35
Inside, you'll find everything you need to build a successful AI powered business. The training, the community,
2:24:40
the ongoing support, everything in one place. Plus, we have an SOP um process inside the AI money lab that shows you
2:24:47
exactly how to implement these AI tools. Link in the comments and description with 100 plus use cases. You see how I
2:24:53
show a checklist of 100 different tutorials that were given away as freebies every day inside the school feed. You can get all the video notes
2:25:00
from there and the other stuff that you get along with all the trainings. On top of that, it has 19,000 members because
2:25:05
people feel like they're missing out and they want to be part of something bigger than them. Also, if you're running a business and want to scale faster, check

out my AI profit boardroom. It's the best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds with
2:25:18
AI automation. We currently have 1,000 members who are transforming their operations with AI. The AI revolution is
2:25:25
happening. If these Gemini 3.0 rumors turn out to be true, it could be proof that we're just getting started. But
2:25:30
remember, everything we've covered today is based on leaks, speculation, and industry rumors. Google hasn't confirmed
2:25:36
any of this officially. the real features, timeline, and capabilities could be completely different from what
2:25:42
we've discussed. The question is, will you be ready when the next big AI breakthrough actually arrives, whatever form it takes. Make sure to subscribe

thoughts on Gemini 3.0. What feature excites you most? How will you use these new capabilities? Thanks for watching,
2:26:00
and I'll see you in the next video where we dive even deeper into the AI tools that are changing everything. Today, I'm
2:26:06
going to show you Google's brand new Gemini CLI update, and it's absolutely insane what they just released for free.
2:26:11
We're talking about AI that now lives inside your VS Code editor. It knows what files you have open. It can see
2:26:17
your selected text, and it can make changes right where you need them. This isn't just some basic chatbot anymore.
2:26:23
This is like having a genius coding partner that never sleeps and costs you 0. Look, I've been tracking AI updates
2:26:30
for years now, and this Gemini CLI update just dropped, and it's making me rethink everything about how we code.
2:26:37
Cuz what Google just did is they took their most powerful AI model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and they gave it eyes into your
2:26:44
actual workspace. Not just access to your files, not just the ability to read your code, but realtime awareness of
2:26:51
exactly what you're working on at any given moment. And here's the crazy part, it's completely free. We're talking
2:26:57
about 60 requests per minute and 1,000 requests per day at zero cost. To put
2:27:02
that in perspective, that's more free usage than most paid AI tools give you. And we're talking about Gemini 2.5 Pro
2:27:08
here, the same model that costs money everywhere else. But before I dive into the technical stuff, let me tell you
2:27:14
what this really means for your workflow. Imagine you're working on a React component. You select a piece of
2:27:19
code that's giving you trouble. Gemini CLI doesn't just see that code. It sees
2:27:24
your entire project structure. It knows what other components you have. It understands your file organization. And
2:27:30
it can suggest fixes that actually make sense in the context of your whole application. That's the difference
2:27:36
between this update and everything else that came before it. Context awareness, real context awareness. So, let me break
2:27:44
down what's actually new in this update. First, the VS Code integration is next level. You install the companion
2:27:50
extension with one command. Type slash ID install in your terminal and boom,
2:27:55
Gemini CLI is now connected to your VS Code workspace. It can see what files you have open. It can access selected
2:28:03
text and it can make intelligent suggestions based on exactly what you're looking at. That's why I created the AI
2:28:09
profit boardroom is where over 1,000 business owners are learning how to use AI tools like one 2.2 plus to scale
2:28:17
their businesses and save hundreds of hours with automation. Inside the boardroom, we break down exactly how to
2:28:23
write prompts that create professional results. We share case studies of businesses making real money with AI
2:28:30
video content, and we give you the exact systems and processes to implement this
2:28:36
in your own business. The members are seeing incredible results. Some are cutting their video production costs by
2:28:42
90%. Others are creating content 10 times faster than before, and many are discovering new revenue streams they
2:28:48
never thought possible. But here's where it gets really interesting. They added something called native in editor
2:28:54
diffing. So when Gemini suggests changes to your code, you don't have to copy and paste anything. You get a visual diff
2:29:00
right in your editor. Green for additions, red for deletions, you can see exactly what's changing before you
2:29:06
accept it. And if you like the changes, you click accept and it's done. The second big thing is GitHub actions
2:29:12
integration. This is where things get scary good because now Gemini CLI can
2:29:18
work as an autonomous agent in your GitHub repositories. It can automatically triage issues. It can
2:29:24
review pull request. And here's the part that blew my mind. You can mention atge Gemini CLI in any issue or pull request
2:29:32
and delegate tasks to it. Tell it to write tests for a bug. Tell it to implement suggested changes. Tell it to
2:29:37
brainstorm solutions and it just does it. This isn't some basic automation either. We're talking about an AI that
2:29:43
understands your codebase architecture. It knows your dependencies. It understands your coding patterns and it
2:29:49
can make changes across multiple files to implement complex features from a single prompt. The third major update is
2:29:56
the model context protocol enhancements. MCP lets you extend Gemini CLI with
2:30:02
custom tools and integrations and they just made it way easier to manage. You can now add, remove, and list MCP
2:30:07
servers right from the command line. No more editing config files manually. And they added support for multimodal
2:30:13
content. So your tools can return text, images, whatever you need. But let me tell you about the free usage limits
2:30:19
because this is where Google just destroyed the competition. Most AI coding tools give you maybe 50 requests
2:30:24
per day for free. Some give you 100 if you're lucky. Google is giving you 1,000 requests per day and 60 requests per
2:30:31
minute. That means you can literally have Gemini CLI helping you code all day long without hitting any limits. And
2:30:37
we're not talking about some dumb down version either. This is Gemini 2.5 Pro, the same model that powers Google's paid
2:30:43
services with a 1 million token context window. That means it can understand massive code bases, entire applications,
2:30:50
and still give you relevant suggestions. Now, let me show you how this actually works in practice. You start Gemini CLI
2:30:57
in your VS Code integrated terminal, run the / ID install command to set up the
2:31:03
connection, then toggle integration with / ID enable. From that point on, Gemini
2:31:08
CLI knows everything about your workspace. Let's say you're working on a bug fix. You select the problematic
2:31:14
code. Gemini CLI sees not just that code, but the entire file, the project
2:31:19
structure, the dependencies, everything. When you ask for help, it gives you suggestions that actually work in your
2:31:25
specific context. Or maybe you're implementing a new feature. You describe what you want to build. Gemini CLI
2:31:32
analyzes your existing codebase, understands your patterns, and suggests implementation approaches that fit your
2:31:38
architecture. And because of the GitHub actions integration, it can even create pulse requests with the implementation.
2:31:45
The terminal setup is also incredibly smart. Now, they added a /terminal setup command that automatically configures
2:31:51
key bindings for multi-line input in VS Code, cursor, and windsurf terminals. So, you get shift plus enter and cruel
2:31:57
plus enter functionality working perfectly. No more fighting with terminal input when you want to write longer prompts. And speaking of prompts,
2:32:04
they added a new / settings command that gives you a userfriendly settings editor right in the CLI. You can customize
2:32:10
everything about how Gemini CLI works without diving into config files. The error handling got a massive upgrade,
2:32:17
too. Better handling for tool errors, schema errors, path processing. They even added loop detection to prevent
2:32:24
infinite loops and memory leak prevention in the logging system. This is enterprisegrade reliability in a free
2:32:30
tool. But here's what really excites me about this update. The open- source nature of it. The entire codebase is
2:32:36
available on GitHub under Apache 2.0 license. That means you can inspect the code, understand how it works, verify
2:32:43
security, and contribute improvements. Google is betting big on community development here and they're building on
2:32:49
emerging standards like MCP system prompts via Gemony.md files and settings
2:32:55
for both personal and team configuration. This isn't just a tool, it's a platform that other developers can build on. The extensibility is
2:33:02
insane. You can create custom extensions, add new tools, integrate with existing workflows, automate
2:33:09
complex tasks, and because it supports OORF 2.0, zero, you can securely connect
2:33:14
to remote servers and services. Now, let me talk about the GitHub actions piece more because this is revolutionary. You
2:33:20
set it up once with the / setup GitHub command. From then on, Gemini CLI
2:33:26
becomes a team member in your repository. It can automatically handle issue triage, labeling, and
2:33:31
prioritization. It reviews pull requests for quality, style, and correctness, and it works asynchronously in the
2:33:37
background using the full context of your project. But the on demand collaboration is where it gets really
2:33:43
powerful. You mention at Gemini client any issue or pull request and give it a task. Write tests for this bug.
2:33:49
Implement the changes suggested above. Brainstorm alternative solutions. Fix this well-defined bug and it just
2:33:55
handles it. The security model is enterprisegrade too. They support workload identity federation for
2:34:01
credentialless authentication. You get granular control with command allow listing. Complete transparency with open
2:34:07
telemetry integration for logging and monitoring. You're always in control of what the AI can and can't do. And here's
2:34:12
something that will save you hours every week. The built-in tools are incredible. Google search grounding so you can fetch
2:34:18
web pages and get real-time context. File operations for reading, writing, and searching code. Shell command
2:34:24
execution for automating tasks. Web fetching for pulling external resources.
2:34:29
all integrated seamlessly into the AI workflow. The workspace context awareness is the gamecher though. When
2:34:36
you connect VS Code to Gemini CLI, it becomes aware of your open files, selected text, project structure,
2:34:43
everything. The suggestions aren't generic. They're tailored to exactly what you're working on. I tested this
2:34:49
with a complex React application. Multiple components, shared state, custom hooks, the whole thing. I
2:34:55
selected a piece of code that was causing performance issues. asked Gemini CLI for optimization suggestions and it
2:35:02
didn't just suggest generic React optimizations. It suggested specific changes that worked with my exact
2:35:08
component structure, my state management approach, my naming conventions. It understood the context. That's the
2:35:14
difference between this and tools like GitHub Copilot or other AI assistants. Those tools are great for autocomplete
2:35:20
and basic suggestions, but they don't really understand your project. Gemini CLI with VS Code integration actually
2:35:27
comprehends your workspace. The diffing capabilities make code review effortless, too. When Gemini suggest
2:35:33
changes, you see exactly what's being modified. You can review line by line, accept or reject specific changes, and
2:35:40
maintain full control over your codebase. No more copyping AI suggestions and hoping they work. And
2:35:45
because it's integrated with Gemini Code Assist, you get the same AI assistance in both your terminal and your IDE.
2:35:51
consistent experience, shared knowledge, seamless workflow. Now, if you're serious about scaling your business with
2:35:57
AI automation, you need to check out my AI profit boardroom. This is where over 1,000 members are learning to use tools
2:36:04
like Gemini CLI to get more customers and save hundreds of hours with AI automation. I share the exact
2:36:10
strategies, workflows, and automations that are working right now. The performance improvements in this update
2:36:16
are substantial, too. They optimize file search with async operations for non-blocking performance. The CLI layout
2:36:21
automatically adapts to different terminal widths, faster loading, better responsiveness, smoother experience
2:36:27
overall, and the documentation got a complete overhaul. They added guides for IDE integration, keyboard shortcuts, the
2:36:34
Jitinor style Gemini ignore files, everything you need to get up and running quickly. The configuration
2:36:40
options are extensive now. You can control line numbers, encode blocks, configure memory loading behavior,
2:36:46
customize themes with semantic colors, and they added support for VS Code like editors beyond just VS code, cursor,
2:36:53
wind surf, even Z editor integration. But let me tell you about the agent mode capabilities because this is where we
2:37:00
see the future of coding. Agent mode acts like an AI pair programmer. It analyzes your entire codebase, not just
2:37:07
the open file. It understands your application architecture, dependencies, coding patterns, relationships between
2:37:14
components, everything. When you give it a complex task like implementing a new feature or performing a large refactor,
2:37:20
it creates a plan first, shows you exactly what it's going to do, you can edit the plan, ask for changes, approve
2:37:27
or deny specific steps. Then it executes the plan across multiple files, making coordinated changes that actually work
2:37:33
together. This collaborative approach combines AI power with your expertise. You stay in control while delegating the
2:37:39
tedious implementation work. The result is better code and a more efficient workflow. The multimodal support opens
2:37:45
up even more possibilities. Tools can return not just text but images, diagrams, charts, whatever helps
2:37:51
communicate the solution. And the prompt as commands feature lets you expose predefined prompts from MCP servers as
2:37:58
new slash commands in the CLI. Realtime troubleshooting is incredibly powerful too. Gemini CLI can access your project
2:38:05
files, run shell commands, search for patterns, analyze logs, and suggest fixes all in one conversation. No more
2:38:13
switching between different tools and losing context. The quotas are designed so you rarely hit limits during
2:38:18
development. 60 requests per minute means you can have rapid back and forth conversations with the AI. 1,000
2:38:24
requests per day means allday coding assistance. And if you need more, you can upgrade to Google AI Studio or
2:38:30
Vertex AI for usage based billing. For teams, the enterprise features are solid. Workload identity federation
2:38:37
eliminates API key management risks. Granular permissions let you implement lease privilege access. Open telemetry
2:38:44
integration gives you full observability into AI usage patents. The checkpoint system is brilliant for experimentation.
2:38:50
Before Gemini CLI modifies files, it can save a project snapshot. If something goes wrong, you can restore to any
2:38:56
previous checkpoint. No more fear of AI breaking your code. File referencing is intuitive. You can reference files,
2:39:02
directories, images, PDFs, audio, video, whatever you need for context. The CLI
2:39:08
respects JIT ignore and Gemini ignore files automatically. Clean, organized, predictable behavior. And the community
2:39:15
aspect is exciting. Google is actively encouraging contributions, bug reports, feature suggestions, security
2:39:21
improvements, code contributions, everything is welcome. This tool is going to evolve rapidly based on real
2:39:26
developer needs. For SEO professionals like myself, the content generation capabilities are incredible. You can use
2:39:33
Gemini CLI for research, writing, analysis, reporting, all with the same context awareness and tool integration.
2:39:39
It's not just for developers. The update cycle is aggressive, too. Preview releases every Tuesday night. Stable
2:39:45
releases weekly. Daily releases from the main branch. This is rapid development with real user feedback driving
2:39:51
improvements. Integration with Google Cloud Services is seamless. if you're already in that ecosystem, but it works
2:39:59
great with any cloud provider, any hosting setup, any development environment. No vendor lock in. The
2:40:05
learning curve is minimal if you're already comfortable with command line tools. The slash commands are intuitive.
2:40:10
The help system is comprehensive, and the documentation is actually readable. The collaboration features work great
2:40:16
for remote teams, too. Multiple developers can use the same GitHub actions workflows, share MCP server
2:40:22
configurations, build on each other's extensions, distributed development with AI assistance, and because Google is
2:40:29
betting big on this, you can expect continued investment, feature development, performance improvements, and ecosystem growth. This isn't a side
2:40:36
project that might get cancelled. This is core to Google's AI strategy. If you want to book a free SEO strategy session

2:41:12
like Gemini CLI are leading the charge. Stay ahead of the curve. Implement these tools early and watch your productivity
2:41:18
sore. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video. New Google Gemini update is insane and it's free. Today
2:41:25
I'm going to show you Google's newest Gemini update that just dropped and it's absolutely crazy. They're giving students a free pro plan worth $240 a
2:41:33
year. Plus, they added this new deep think feature that thinks like a human brain. It uses parallel thinking to solve complex problems. And there's
2:41:39
temporary chats that keep everything private. This update is gamechanging and most of it is completely free. Hey, if
2:41:44
we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's
2:41:50
helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Google just dropped
2:41:55
their biggest Gemini update ever. And honestly, it's insane what they're giving away for free. I'm talking about features that could replace expensive AI
2:42:03
tools, features that students are getting for free, and new reasoning abilities that rival the best AI models
2:42:08
out there. Let me break down everything that's new, because if you're not using these features, you're missing out big time. First up, Google is giving
2:42:14
students a completely free 1-year pro plan. This normally costs $20 a month. That's $240 worth of value for free.
2:42:21
Students in the US, Japan, Indonesia, Korea, and Brazil can get this deal. You just need to be 18 or older. And the
2:42:28
offer ends October 6, 2025. So if you are a student, you need to grab this now. But here's what makes this deal
2:42:33
insane. The Pro plan includes unlimited chat with Gemini 2.5 Pro. That's their most powerful model. You also get image
2:42:40
uploads, quiz generation for homework help, exam prep tools, plus 2 TB of storage. Most AI companies charge $ 20
2:42:47
to $30 per month for these features. Google is giving it away for a whole year. That's how serious they are about
2:42:53
getting students hooked on their AI. Now, let's talk about the new study features because these are available to
2:42:58
everyone, not just prousers. First is guided learning. This isn't just getting quick answers. It's like having a
2:43:03
personal tutor. Gemini breaks down complex topics step by step. It adapts explanations to your needs. It helps you
2:43:09
understand the how and why behind concepts. Think about it. Instead of just telling you the answer to a math problem, it walks you through each step.
2:43:16
It explains why each step works. It makes sure you actually understand the concept. Then there's the quiz and
2:43:21
flashcard creator. You can upload your notes, charts, or graphs. Gemini instantly creates practice quizzes and
2:43:27
flashcards. It's like having unlimited quiz generation from any content you give it. The study guide creator is
2:43:32
equally impressive. Upload your course files. Gemini organizes everything into structured study guides. It pulls out
2:43:38
key concepts. It creates visual learning aids. It even integrates YouTube videos and diagrams to make learning more
2:43:44
engaging. These features alone could replace expensive study apps like Quizlet or Study Blue. And Google is
2:43:50
giving them away for free. Now, here's something that addresses a huge concern. Temporary chats. You know how AI
2:43:56
companies use your conversations to train their models and how everything gets saved to your chat history? Well,
2:44:02
Google finally listened. Temporary chats don't appear in your recent chats. They don't get used to train Google's AI
2:44:08
models. They don't personalize your Gemini experience. They're kept for just 72 hours to respond to you, then they're
2:44:13
gone. This is perfect for exploring private questions, brainstorming sensitive ideas, or just having
2:44:18
conversations you don't want saved. To use it, just select the temporary chat icon next to new chat. It's rolling out
2:44:23
to everyone over the coming weeks. But here's the flip side. Google also improved personalization for regular
2:44:28
chats. Now, if you want to learn how to actually make money with these AI tools, I've got something special for you. The
2:44:34
AI Money Lab has over 19,000 members learning how to monetize AI. Inside, you'll find 100 plus use cases for AI
2:44:40
tools like Gemini, step-by-step tutorials, SOPs, and processes you can implement immediately, plus weekly
2:44:46
training calls where I share the latest AI money-making strategies. You can access everything through the link in the comments and description. And right
2:44:53
now, we're giving away video notes and bonus trainings to new members. The checklist alone has 100 different AI
2:44:59
tutorials. Every day inside the school feed, you get new strategies for using AI to make money. Whether that's content
2:45:05
creation, client services, or building AI powered businesses, Gemini can now learn from your past chats. It remembers
2:45:11
your preferences. It gives you more personalized responses the more you use it. Here's how this works in practice.
2:45:16
Say you've asked Gemini for book recommendations from Booktop before. Now, when you ask for new book suggestions, it remembers your taste. It
2:45:23
suggests similar themes. It even provides popular quotes for your social posts. Or maybe you've used Gemini to
2:45:29
brainstorm YouTube content about Japanese culture. When you ask for new content ideas, it suggests video themes
2:45:34
that match your interests, like trying new Japanese foods, traditional crafts like origami or Japanese games. This
2:45:40
learning happens automatically. But you have complete control. You can turn off this keep activity setting anytime or
2:45:45
use temporary chats when you don't want Gemini to learn from those conversations. Now, here's where things get really crazy. Google launched deep
2:45:53
think for ultra subscribers and this feature is absolutely insane. Deep think uses parallel thinking techniques just
2:46:00
like how humans brainstorm complex problems. Instead of rushing to an answer, Gemini generates multiple ideas
2:46:06
at once. It considers them simultaneously. It revises and combines different approaches all before giving
2:46:11
you the best answer. This isn't just marketing speak. Deepthink scored 87.6%
2:46:16
on live code bench. That's competition level coding problems. It achieved gold medal performance at the International
2:46:21
Mathematical Olympiad. It outperformed models from Open AI, XAI, and Anthropic
2:46:27
on multiple benchmarks. But here's what makes it practical. Deep Think excels at iterative development, building
2:46:32
something complex piece by piece. It's amazing for web development tasks. It considers time complexity and trade-offs
2:46:38
carefully. It produces more detailed and aesthetically pleasing results. The downside, it's only available to ultra
2:46:44
subscribers. That's $250 per month, and you get limited prompts per day, but the results are genuinely impressive. Google
2:46:50
also launched a storybook feature. You can create personalized illustrated story books about any topic with read
2:46:56
aloud narration. Just describe what you want, like create a story book for my daughters explaining my career based on
2:47:02
my resume and photo. Gemini creates a unique 10-page illustrated story book complete with custom audio narration.
2:47:09
You can add photos and files to teach lessons through visual storytelling. Explore moments from the past or create
2:47:14
imaginative fiction. This might seem like a fun gimmick, but think about the possibilities. Content creators could use this for storytelling. Teachers
2:47:21
could create custom learning materials. Parents could make personalized bedtime stories. It's another example of Google
2:47:26
expanding beyond just text chat. They're making AI more creative and visual. Speaking of visual, Google improve their
2:47:32
video generation, too. With V3, you can transform photos into 8second video clips with sound. Right in the Gemini
2:47:38
app, Ultra subscribers get the highest access to V3 Pro subscribers get limited access to VO3 fast. But even the limited
2:47:45
access is pretty impressive. Now, let's talk about what these updates mean for business and content creation. The study
2:47:50
features aren't just for students. They're perfect for professional development, training new employees,
2:47:55
creating educational content for customers. The personalization means Gemini gets better at understanding your
2:48:00
business needs over time. It remembers your industry, your content style, your target audience. Deep Think, if you can
2:48:07
afford Ultra, is incredibly powerful for complex business problems. Strategic planning, technical architecture,
2:48:13
competitive analysis, problems that require considering multiple angles and iterating solutions. The video
2:48:19
generation opens up new content possibilities. Quick explainer videos, social media content, product demos, all
2:48:25
without expensive video tools or editing skills. What's really interesting is how this positions Google against Open AI
2:48:30
and anthropic. Google is clearly going aggressive on pricing and features. While Open AI charges $20 per month for
2:48:36
Chat GPT plus, Google is giving away pro features to students for free. While others limit video generation to
2:48:41
expensive tiers, Google includes it in their basic pro plan. The deep think feature directly competes with OpenAI's
2:48:46
01 reasoning models, but Google is being more transparent about how it works. They're explaining the parallel thinking
2:48:52
approach. They're sharing benchmark results. This competition is great for users. It's pushing all companies to
2:48:58
innovate faster and price more aggressively. Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below with which feature you're most excited
2:49:04
to try. Here's exactly how to get access to these features. For the free student pro plan, go to Google's Gemini signup
2:49:10
page. You'll need to verify your student status. Remember, this offer ends October 6th, 2025. For temporary chats,
2:49:18
look for the temporary chat icon next to new chat in the Gemini app. It's rolling out gradually, so you might not see it
2:49:24
immediately. The study features like guided learning in quiz creation are available to everyone. Just start a conversation with Gemini and ask it to
2:49:30
create study materials from your content. For Deep Think, you need an Ultra subscription at $250 per month. It
2:49:35
appears as a toggle in the prompt bar when using Gemini 2.5 Pro. The storybook feature is available to all users. Just
2:49:42
ask Gemini to create a storybook about any topic. Google isn't slowing down. They've hinted at even more features
2:49:47
coming soon. Better integration with Google Workspace, more video generation capabilities, expanded language support
2:49:54
for study features. They're also working on Project Mariner. That's their AI agent that can actually use your
2:49:59
computer, browse websites, fill out forms, make reservations, is currently in early testing for Ultra subscribers.
2:50:07
The AI space is moving incredibly fast. New models every month, new features every week. If you're not staying
2:50:13
updated, you're falling behind. This Gemini update is massive. The free student pro plan alone is worth $240.
2:50:20
The study features could replace multiple paid apps. The personalization makes Gemini more useful over time, even
2:50:25
if you're not a student. These features are worth exploring. The study tools work for any learning or training situation. The personalization improves
2:50:32
your experience. The temporary chats give you privacy when you need it. And if you're serious about AI and have the
2:50:37
budget, Deepthink is genuinely impressive. It's the closest thing to humanlike reasoning I've seen in an AI
2:50:43
model. The competition between AI companies is heating up. That means better features, lower prices, and more
2:50:49
innovation for users. Google is clearly positioning Gemini as the free alternative to premium AI tools. Here's
2:50:55
what I recommend you do right now. First, if you're a student, grab that free pro plan immediately. The offer
2:51:00
ends October 6th, and this is $240 worth of value. Second, test out the study features. Even if you're not studying
2:51:07
formally, try creating quizzes from your work documents or use guided learning to understand complex topics in your
2:51:12
industry. Third, experiment with the storybook feature if you create content. It's a unique way to engage audiences
2:51:18
and could differentiate your content. Fourth, consider whether Deep Think is worth $250 per month for your use case.
2:51:24
If you're working on complex problems that require deep analysis, it might be worth the investment. Before we wrap up,
2:51:29
I want to mention my AI profit boardroom. This is where 1,00 plus members are learning to scale their
2:51:34
businesses with AI automation. We share cutting edge strategies for getting more customers and saving hundreds of hours

2:52:02
description. Google's Gemini update shows they're serious about competing in the AI space. They're not just matching
2:52:08
features from other companies. They're innovating and pricing aggressively. The fact that students get a $240 per year
2:52:15
value for free is incredible. It shows Google is thinking long term. They want to build loyalty with the next
2:52:20
generation of AI users. For everyone else, these features make Gemini a legitimate competitor to Chat GPT Plus
2:52:26
and Claude Pro. The study tools alone could save you money on other apps. The AI revolution is happening now.
2:52:32
Companies that adapt and integrate these tools will have massive advantages. Those that don't will get left behind.

2:52:44
Comment below with questions and start experimenting with these new Gemini features today. The future is being
2:52:50
built right now and tools like these updated Gemini features are your opportunity to be part of it. Thanks for
2:52:55
watching and I'll see you in the next AI update. We have some brand new updates from Google Gemini. And today I'm going
2:53:02
to run you through exactly how they work, how to use them, etc. And these are completely free. So one of the
2:53:08
newest updates, for example, is the personalization. Also got a bunch of other methods. I've actually left a
2:53:14
bunch of notes inside the AI profit boardroom if you want to learn exactly how to do it. So one of the biggest
2:53:19
updates here is the guided learning mode, right? So this is basically like an interactive teaching mode and it
2:53:26
basically tests you and shows you exactly how to learn things quickly. That's similar to for example something
2:53:32
like Notebook LM which is a really powerful free tool as well. But basically this is a really cool way to
2:53:40
do guided learning as you're learning something throughout the journey. Right? So let me show you an example of exactly
2:53:46
how this works. You can now use you've got an option between Gemini and guided learning in Gemini. You see the
2:53:52
difference here? So, there's two different ways of using it, right? We're going to be testing this. For example,
2:53:57
we've got an example right here, right? And you can see here we've got, I'm a freshman preparing for an exam in my
2:54:03
intro in biology class. Can you help me learn about enzymes? Blah blah blah. And then we can use the guided learning
2:54:10
method to help us learn faster. Now, at the same time, what we can also do is we
2:54:15
can say, okay, recall my recent conversations with you. And you can
2:54:20
actually ask Gemini now for questions and that sort of thing. And it will actually recall recent information,
2:54:25
right? So it says, for example, looks like we've had a few conversations recently. We discussed funny scenes with AI articles on the future of AI agents,
2:54:32
clustering keywords, news headlines, blah blah blah. Okay? And so it's really easy and powerful to do this and it
2:54:38
doesn't take a long time, but it is a bit of a game changer. Now if you're using something like chat cheapy I think normally you do have to pay for that
2:54:44
feature whereas now for example it's fully loaded with all of the different
2:54:49
ways you can use this and it's super simple and easy to do as well step by step. All right now Raz says Gemini 3 is
2:54:57
Gemini 3 out. It's not out yet but hopefully it comes soon. So I haven't seen Gemini 3 come out yet but there are
2:55:02
a lot of rumors and that sort of thing. Check out my other video on it if you want to learn exactly how to use it step
2:55:07
by step. So you can see here if we go back to Google Gemini now. So to get a good handle on this free exam, we could
2:55:14
focus on a few key areas. Can you quiz me? And then it should be able to actually turn this into an interactive
2:55:20
quiz, which is great cuz now you can basically just learn way faster, right? And so you can actually see what it's doing here is it's taken the problem
2:55:27
that I had, which was learn about enzymes. Absolutely don't miss out from my school days learn biology. And then
2:55:33
from here you can see that we've got an enzymes quiz and we're living the enzyme dream my friends. All right. And then
2:55:38
you can for example get tested. I've actually got a question right there. That is unbelievable isn't it? And then
2:55:44
you can go through the quiz step by step like this directly here. What else we got here? So we got guided learning
2:55:50
mode. We've also got temporary chats, right? So not only the personalization that we were talking about previously where you can recall recent things.
2:55:56
Another cool thing you can do here is you can say okay knowing what you know about me what's a big area of growth and
2:56:03
this is the way that I use chat GPT actually usually I try and ask it like based on our conversations based on what
2:56:08
you know about me etc where are some areas I can improve what are some systems I could set up etc and then you
2:56:14
can easily get this bad boy set up right and you see here for example yeah you have a strong creative interest in
2:56:19
artificial intelligence you're pretty weak at your enzymes for biology mate so here's some other things you could
2:56:25
actually combine the two based on our previous conversations. Does exploring this sound interesting to you? Blah blah
2:56:30
blah. And then you can go off and start creating quizzes or whatever you want. Really simple and easy to do. So, let's
2:56:36
keep going now. So, we've talked about two different things there. Number one is the personal context. Number two is
2:56:41
the guided learning mode. Let's have a look at the temporary chats up here. So, if we go to new chat, we've got a bunch of options. We got import code. We
2:56:48
should be able to start a new chat here. But before I get into that, I want to show you this as well. This is quite interesting. So, we've got these story
2:56:54
books, right? So basically you can create a customized picture book for either children or adults. Give a topic
2:57:00
an optional target audience and an optional art style for images. Right? So let's plug this in. We'll test it out.
2:57:06
So I'm going to say okay based on the recent updates in the AI world. For example, chat GPT give me a storyboard
2:57:14
for adults that would be funny talking about the world of AI and how bad Chat
2:57:21
GBT 5 was despite us waiting 2 years for it. something like that, right? And then
2:57:26
we can actually start building out a story book using this process, right? So you can see it's now creating a story
2:57:31
book, writing the first draft. So you can actually like create audio books and story books on the spot for you. Pretty
2:57:37
crazy. So we'll just wait for that to load and we should be good to go on that in a second. What else we got here? So whilst that's loading, we can come back
2:57:44
to that in a minute. We also have image generation. Right now, this is actually available apparently inside Google Docs
2:57:50
as well, but also you can use the new image gen 4 that just came out inside
2:57:55
here. Right. So, if you go to image gen generate with image gen and then we'll say the cat eating biscety and we'll
2:58:02
just wait for that to lo and that'll just generate an image. Right? So, it's basically like an interactive sort of learning environment now where you can
2:58:08
build apps, you can build quizzes, you can learn what you want and I actually think like Gemini Pro is easily one of
2:58:14
the best out there. It's right up there in terms of responses versus Claude. Claude can't generate images and it
2:58:21
definitely cannot generate pictures of cats eating biscatinos like this. That's world class. And then also you've got
2:58:27
for example stuff like chat GBT5, but I know a lot of people feel let down by that and it's not quite as good. So
2:58:33
Gemini might be a good option. I also think one of the strongest points of Gemini is that it can actually create
2:58:39
really good apps directly inside here. Right? So if you ever been like I want to build an app but I don't know how to do it. We have a lot of training inside
2:58:45
the AI profit bordering but also you can just go inside the chat here toggle on canvas right so you can start a new chat
2:58:51
and then from the canvas feature you can start building stuff out right so for example let's go inside here and we'll
2:58:57
say create create an app about and then you plug in whatever your app is about so let's say for example it is about
2:59:03
maybe keyword research for SEO right and what it's going to do is just start going off and building that out so wait
2:59:09
for that in a minute but in whilst that's coding out in the background over here what we're going to do is we're going to go onto Gemini. And what you
2:59:17
can see is you can actually if we unmute this, you can actually listen back to the storyboard, right? So you can not
2:59:22
only flick through the storyboard and have a great time reading it, but also you can just listen to it. So let's have
2:59:27
a listen to this. I feel bad for Barry. Barry's had a hard day in the office. This man look all excited about chat
2:59:34
GPT5. Brenda's just not having it. She's not having it. Now if you don't have
2:59:39
That's interesting, actually. So you might not be able to hear that back. So, what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to change the speaker. One second
2:59:46
here. Let's see if you can hear this or not. Let me know in the comments if you can hear this or not. The year is 2025. For two long years,
2:59:54
the world held its breath for one thing. Chat GPT5. Tech gurus prophesied its
3:00:00
arrival. Influencers vlogged about its potential. And Barry, a man whose greatest technical achievement was
3:00:06
programming his coffee maker. Can you hear that or not? If you can, just let me know in the comments so that I can help you. If it's not working, I
3:00:12
will share a link inside the air profit boardroom. You could just steal that from me. But essentially, it's pretty amazing that you can just create a story
3:00:18
on the fly and then you can go from there. So, I'm going to just put that inside the profit boardroom here.
3:00:25
Waited most impatiently of all. This is Brenda, he'd say to his long-suffering wife, his eyes gleaming with the fervor
3:00:31
of a true believer. It's going to write my novel, plan our vacation, and finally figure out what the day it launched. The
3:00:39
internet practically buckled with trembling hands. Typed his first momentous query. Chat GPT5. What is the
3:00:46
meaning of life? He leaned back, ready for enlightenment. The AI word. Pixels
3:00:52
danced. And then the answer appeared. 42. He tried again. Okay. Can you help
3:00:57
me write a best-selling sci-fi novel? Chat GPT5 responded instantly. Synopsis:
3:01:03
A brave toaster and a cynical microwave go on a quest to find the legendary golden spatula. It's a buddy comedy with
3:01:09
lasers. What about that weird smell in the fridge? He typed, his last hope dwindling. The AI's response was a
3:01:17
single unhelpful image. A stock photo of a man shrugging. Brenda walked in
3:01:22
holding a Tupperware container at arms length. "I found the smell," she announced, her voice flat. "It was your
3:01:28
two week old science experiment with leftover chili." Barry looked from the sentient appliance novel plot to the
3:01:34
shrugging man on his screen, then to the biohazard his wife was holding. The great leap forward for humanity felt
3:01:41
more like a clumsy stumble into a puddle of forgotten leftovers. He started to laugh. It was a slow, rumbling chuckle
3:01:48
that grew into a full-blown belly laugh. Two years of hype, of breathless anticipation for an AI that was
3:01:55
essentially a glorified taco obsessed magic eightball, he said, wiping a tear from his eye. At least we know what's
3:02:01
for dinner. Brenda just shook her head, a small smile playing on her lips. The future was here, and it was gloriously,
3:02:08
hilariously, disappointingly human, and it definitely wanted tacos. All right, there peeps. I had to move
3:02:14
the microphone, so that's why I didn't talk. But essentially, what you can see here is we have a generated video with
3:02:21
one single click. I literally generated it live for you today. The video was made fully with Gemini. The images were
3:02:27
made with Gemini. It was all storyboarded and put together like an artifact style with audio and it's
3:02:34
sharable. You can also flick between a lower pitch voice and a higher pitch voice,
3:02:39
he said, wiping a tear from his eye. At least we know what's for dinner. Brenda just shook her head, a small smile
3:02:45
playing on her lips. "It reminds me a little bit of Blinkist, but slightly more amusing and
3:02:52
interesting." All right, so let's click on share. Now, if we click on share, we can create that audio book. I can share
3:02:58
it with the world. And then you've got that ready to go. Kind of like I've added down here, right? That's a
3:03:03
sharable link. And so you can do that with Gemini. Pretty cool. That was the audio generated right there. Some people
3:03:09
asking like what are the export functions? So I think you can print this off, right? So you can actually download
3:03:15
it as a PDF. I don't think you can actually download it as a video from
3:03:20
what I can see. It's not really a video. It's kind of like more a PDF document with a voice over at the top. So, I can
3:03:26
imagine that's why they just make it sharable. Maybe as well they don't want people going out and spamming YouTube or
3:03:31
something like that, which totally makes sense. We don't want that. We don't want just a holy YouTube to be AI
3:03:36
storyboarding. Steven, head of growth at Goldie Agency is here. He says, "This is
3:03:42
me spying on my boss. What a legend." Good to see you here, Stephen. Just perusing LinkedIn. If you saw me there,
3:03:48
this is what I do on this is what we do for fun. If you're wondering what I'm doing, by the way, just so everyone's
3:03:54
clear, Steven works with our agencies. Absolutely awesome guy to work with. And if you want to book in a sales call,
3:04:00
link in the comments in description to book in a free SEO strategy session. All right, so we're good to go. We can
3:04:06
download it. We can start from the beginning. We can listen to full. And literally all I said here, it was very creative. If I just said based on the
3:04:12
recent updates in the AI world, for example, chat sheet 5, give me a story board for adults that would be funny
3:04:17
talking about the world of AI and how bad chat sheet 5 was despite us waiting
3:04:23
2 years for it. And if you're good with Stephen in the comments, he might even send you a video of him dancing at a
3:04:30
Goldie Agency Poland get together that was absolutely legendary recently. All right, so we're going to kick this back
3:04:36
off now. We've basically got Gemini created storyboards. It's really good at
3:04:41
creating personalized conversations. It creates these guided learning modes and it's very good at generating images.
3:04:48
What other AI in the world can do this? Tell me. Literally, just tell me one AI in the world that can do this apart from
3:04:54
Gemini because the image quality is topnotch. You might get good outputs from Claude, but you won't get good
3:04:59
image quality. You could use chat GPT5, but can you create animated storyboards
3:05:05
on chat GPT5? No. And everyone feels quite let down by it. I think just in general and then also you can create
3:05:11
these quick SAS tools I call them like for example we can say here create an app about keyword research for SEO and
3:05:17
then boom shack like aer we can get that right here so if we click on get suggestions we've got all these keyword
3:05:23
suggestions we just built out a keyword tool that's actually sharable with people and then we've got a bunch of
3:05:28
keyword ideas here right and it was all just created in one shot looks really nice and so you can see the power of
3:05:34
Gemini like honestly if I had to focus on one single if I said who's going to win out of all the AI options out there.
3:05:40
Who's going to win? I would genuinely say Google are probably leading the race. If you look at what, for example, Chat GPT are doing, they rely heavily on
3:05:47
marketing, right? They got someone amazing like a frontman Sam Wman and he's a great frontman for the brand, but
3:05:52
at the same time, if they didn't have that marketing, then it would be a struggle, right? If we go back to Google
3:05:57
now as well, let's just check. Yeah, Google absolutely smashing it, right? If you look at their growth over the last
3:06:02
year or so, they're absolutely flying. They seem to be making very good moves in the industry in general, right? Don't
3:06:09
bear in mind as well they got stuff like notebook LM. They've got stuff like for example Google jewels. They got Google
3:06:16
CLI etc. So it's really powerful stuff. Aaron says Google is too censored chat
3:06:22
less. It depends what you're doing with it, right? For me I don't really have anything that would be going against
3:06:27
their guidelines. So I guess I just don't come across that. But it depends what industry you're in, right? Depends what dodgy stuff you're doing on there.
3:06:33
And Abdul says, "Please tell me how to use it shortly. Then I will see the live afterwards." All right. So if you want to do this, all you do is you go to
3:06:39
Gemini and then you know you say, okay, create a storyboard about and then you
3:06:45
just type in whatever the storyboard is about, right? So let's say for example, SEO is dead because chat GPT came along
3:06:53
and destroyed it. But we're happy now because actually people search more than ever. Actually, I'm going to use link
3:06:58
whisper flow for this more than ever because AI search is growing every day as people get addicted to searching in
3:07:04
there and because they can actually get better responses in Google, right? By the way, if you're wondering what I just use for that's whisper flow. So, we're
3:07:10
going to say create a storyboard for that. That should toggle it on. And then let's see if that triggers automatically
3:07:15
or if I have to click one of the options. I think we're going to be good to go on that. It's generating an image, but I can't see a storyboard. Let's go
3:07:21
back to story book. A story book. All right. So, we have to do it in here. We say, "Okay, create a story book." And
3:07:27
then that should toggle it on. All right. So, just to recap for the steps, you go up to gems, you go up to story
3:07:33
book, you say, "Create a story book about whatever you want." And then it will start creating that, right? And goes off and does that bad boy. What
3:07:39
else we got here? So, Veil 3 says, I think Veil 3 is supported in Gemini Studio. Can we convert the story book in
3:07:46
video? As far as I'm aware, you can't. But what you can actually do is you just get something like Dcript is really
3:07:52
good. Or you can use something like, for example, Streamlabs. You just record your screen. Even Loom would probably do
3:07:58
the job. And then from there, all you would do is you would just go back to the story book that we created. So like
3:08:04
this one. And then once that's done, just record your screen whilst you're playing it, right? And play it full screen. And then that's problem solved,
3:08:10
right? You got the Google file ready to go. User X says, can you please talk about batch processing and scalability?
3:08:16
How we can scale this type of applications? Yeah, you can use something like NA10, right? Just keeping it really simple. But if you want to
3:08:22
keep this stuff simple, I I assume if you want to scale applications, you can use something like NA10. It's really
3:08:27
easy to just scale stuff and have it working on a repetitive loop with the API. The other option that you have,
3:08:33
right, let's say, for example, with batch scaling, you're talking about clawed. So, you can use clawed code for that. I'm not going to get too much into
3:08:40
it because it goes way outside the scope of this live stream, this video, but yeah, feel free to jump in the AR profit
3:08:45
boardroom if you want more help on that. Right? If you go to the calendar here, we actually do five coaching calls a week. So you can just jump on the
3:08:51
coaching calls, ask us any questions live. If you can't make it, you can ask questions inside the community and that sort of thing as well. Let's see what we
3:08:57
got. What else we got here? Google's prototype team is really good. The quality of AI products they are releasing is really useful. I'd 100%
3:09:04
agree with that. Right? Bear in mind like we're only looking at the front end of Gemini. But if you go to AI Studio,
3:09:10
it's redonkulous what else you can do with it. Right? So for example, if you go inside AI studio here, you can stream
3:09:16
your screen in real time and just speak to the AI like whatever AI can do that right now on the desktop. You can also,
3:09:23
for example, generate media. You can, for example, build stuff. So you can build apps directly with Gemini here.
3:09:29
And there's all these different apps that you can actually just test if you just want to have a go at something that's already pre-made and you're not
3:09:35
sure what you're doing. And then also, yeah, you've got the build and the stream section. Let's go on the stream section here. So, if we go to share
3:09:40
screen, and I'm just going to go to share screen here. We'll share screen, too. What's cracker lacking, my friend?
3:09:46
Not much. Just hanging out. Okay, great. So, I'm going to go into Google Gemini. Could you give me an idea
3:09:51
for an SEO app that we could build? Sure. How about an app that analyzes website content for SEO optimization?
3:09:58
And all right, so you get the point. It was a little bit laggy there. I think it's cuz I'm live streaming, but you get the point. Like, you can just ask it to come
3:10:04
up with SEO optimization tips and then whatever. It's good to go. All right. living the dream right there. And then
3:10:10
user X says, I was working on a massive data management project for an industry. The problem is scalability and even if
3:10:16
we do batch processing, we still lose a lot of context. Any suggestions, please. It goes way outside the scope of this,
3:10:22
but I would just look more into batch processing how you can do it. There's another way you can actually get the costs of, for example, claude down as
3:10:28
well, but also bear in mind all these apps are all these APIs are upgrading in terms of their context windows. So for
3:10:34
example, Claude this week increased its contact window by 1 million, right? So it went from 200K to 1 million. Then you
3:10:40
also got, for example, Google Gemini. That's 1 million context window. And to be honest, like they probably give it the next update. Who knows what Google
3:10:48
3.0 is going to be like. Google Gemini 3.0. It's going to be absolutely crazy. Sarang says there's a print error when
3:10:54
doesn't print. Okay. And then DT says, "Yo, this screen share feature is really solve a painoint for a lot of people."
3:11:01
Yeah. And crazy thing about this is that nobody even knows about it or even really understands how to use it
3:11:07
properly, but it's an absolute game changer. So now we're going to listen to The Owl and the Firefly by Julian Goldie
3:11:13
SEO apparently. Now if we click on print, let's have a look here. Will it print or not? So you can see it's loading the bar right there. Just coming
3:11:19
back to question. It's preparing it. Is it going to break or is it not? It did something. It didn't download it. Let's
3:11:25
click on print again. Yeah, you might be right there. It doesn't. There might be a bug, but bear in mind it's like it's relatively new. Fair enough. So, let's
3:11:32
play this now. The Owl and the Firefly. In the heart of the big, bustling city of Wabopous lived
3:11:38
an old owl named Silas. From his perch high at top the great library, he had
3:11:44
watched the city grow. For years, everyone came to Silas for answers. He
3:11:49
knew all the secret paths and hidden alleys of Obopoulos, the best keywords to whisper to get the best results. He
3:11:56
was the master of search engine optimization or SEO for short. Then one
3:12:02
day, a new light appeared in Wopopoulos. It was Sparky, a tiny firefly who zipped
3:12:08
and zoomed through the city streets, leaving a trail of brilliant light. Sparky didn't know the old paths. He
3:12:14
made new ones. He didn't whisper keywords. He had conversations. He was an AI and he was changing everything.
3:12:21
Soon the crowds that just coming back to this, so Abdul says, what is this about? How can we use this
3:12:26
storyboard? So essentially what you can do with this storyboard is you can create like interactive storyboards to
3:12:32
learn about stuff. A lot of people for example quite a few people inside the air profit board have asked like how can
3:12:37
you create comics or how can you create books etc. And this one of the best ways to do it one of the easiest ways to do
3:12:42
it. And essentially what this book is about this is more honestly this is more like a I would say it feels more like a
3:12:49
kids story to be honest. If I go back let's X off that. Yeah. So we say create a story book about SEO instead blah blah
3:12:55
blah. I think it's created more like a kids style story, but you could ask it for an adult story as well. So, for
3:13:01
example, then you can come up with a bunch of ideas like all right. So, if we go to recent as well. So, you can see
3:13:06
recent and then we can listen back to this one. User X says, can you talk about image recognition and video
3:13:11
recognition capabilities of Gemini multimodal capabilities? Everyone talks about image and video generation real
3:13:16
world industry. Yeah. So, so what you can do for example when when you're looking at for example like video generation, right? Video generation is
3:13:23
really cool because you can create if we go back here. If I click on let's see what we got video, right? And you can
3:13:29
actually add a v photo. So you can actually animate yourself as well. Let's pull up a photo of me and then we can
3:13:35
actually use that to generate a video. So bear with me folks. I've downloaded a photo and then we can upload that for
3:13:40
consistency into Gemini. All right. So we're going to upload a photo now. Let's take that picture. And then from here,
3:13:46
we're going to say, right, okay, create a video of this man telling a funny joke
3:13:54
and then flying into the sky. Something like that. So, we're taking that picture. And the reason that it's pretty
3:14:00
good for uploading the picture is you can basically create character consistency. So, previously, if you
3:14:05
generate a video, every time you ask it to generate, say, image of a man, it would be like a different man every
3:14:11
time. Or even if you were very specific with the description, it would change every time. with this process instead
3:14:16
you're going to have the same character inside each video that you generate. Right? And so now we can generate the
3:14:22
video. This is using BO3 which is by far one of the best ways to do this. And then also if we went back to let's start
3:14:29
another chat on the side, right? We went back to another chat here and then we took an image. Right? So we'll upload an
3:14:35
image. We'll say okay based on that multimodal capability that image recognition for example we'll say
3:14:41
describe this person and then it should start analyzing that picture and analyzing me as a person. So just and
3:14:47
this the other cool thing as well is you can do this in different tabs. So you can have all of this running at the same
3:14:52
time. And because it's in Chrome, it's not going to cost you memory or anything like that, right? It's just running in the background. So it now basically
3:14:58
explains what I'm wearing, who the man is. Man's wearing a watch, whatever. Short brown textured hair, subtle
3:15:04
highlights, defined jawline, and prominent cheekbones. I like that description. It's very, it's being very
3:15:10
like complimentary today. And then we have the clothing, everything else. Right. So that's super easy to do. So
3:15:15
you can use that directly here. Now, if you go back here, now we've got the video. I don't know if this is going to
3:15:21
work, but let's test it out because I did stretch it quite far with the description, but let's see what we get back.
3:15:26
Why don't scientists trust Adams? Because they make up everything. All right, so that's basically how you
3:15:31
can animate a image. Obviously, the flying into the skyline didn't work, but I think that was just stretching it a
3:15:37
bit too far. You can see exactly how to use this and how easy this is, right? So, let's see what else we got here. DT
3:15:43
Workspace says, I used Gemini mobile app with Gemini camera feature in real life. No need to type in chat window to ask
3:15:49
any question. just use camera and get the solution. Google product team solving real used problems. Yeah, 100%
3:15:54
100%. Actually, like I was booking a flight before and I had a picture of the passport and I had this really long form
3:16:00
that I had to fill in. I had to grab all the individual details from the passport picture and then type it into the form.
3:16:05
I was like, I'm not going to do that. So, instead, what I actually did was I took a picture, plugged it into the app,
3:16:10
and then said, take those detail and put it into a copied and pasteable format for the form in the order of the form.
3:16:16
And it saved me a lot of admin, right? So it was way faster for that. So yeah, it was really good. He's got a lot of good options there to work with apps
3:16:22
marked in brainstorm. This is really gold. Use X says what benchmarks you use for comparison of the models. Honestly,
3:16:28
for me, like I don't trust benchmarks at all, right? Cuz as well, like it it depends how many people are using the
3:16:34
server. You don't know what kind of upgrades are running. If you look at chat 5 when I tested out the other day
3:16:39
and you'll see this on one of my videos, I ran exactly the same prompt inside Claude as chat GPT and Claude outcoded
3:16:47
it, right? Claude actually created an output. Chat GPT totally failed. And so the lesson there was like this AI is
3:16:54
maybe good on the benchmarks, but in reality when you're using it dayto-day, it's actually not as good as you think.
3:17:00
And Magic says Gemini or Manis. So it depends what you're doing. But honestly, like if you Here's the thing, right? If
3:17:06
you go on to Manis and we'll pull this up right now. So I do man, you know, it's quite good. I actually tend to use GenSpark more. But if you use Manis and
3:17:14
you use Gemini and we use exactly the same prompt. So we're going to say, okay, let's go back here. We'll say, yeah, we'll say inside the canvas, okay,
3:17:21
create a quiz about SEO, right? Just something quick and easy like that. And
3:17:26
we'll do the same inside manus exactly the same time. So we're going to ask them both side by side to create a quiz
3:17:31
about SEO, right? So what you can see here is that Gemini, if we compare these side by side, Gemini is already coding
3:17:36
it, right? It's already building something, which is great. Now, if you look at Manus, Manus is going to take absolutely ages cuz what it actually
3:17:43
does is it uses browser use and computer use to go off through the internet, start trying to figure stuff out to do,
3:17:50
then it's going to host it on an MD file, which weird, and then it's going to format it and deliver it, right? And let's have a look here. So this is the
3:17:57
quiz. Now, if you look at this quiz, it's not interactive. It's not that interesting, etc. If you look at Gemini, look at that quiz. The quiz is way
3:18:03
better, right? It's interactive, it's engaging, it's more fun, etc., right? And so the difference here is that
3:18:09
Gemini tends to create better outputs at the same speed as Manis, right? Whereas Manus, it creates something basic, then
3:18:16
you have to go back in chat, you give it another response, then you blast through a bunch more credits and it gets a
3:18:21
little bit annoying, right? What you can do though inside, for example, inside Manis is you can do stuff that you
3:18:26
cannot do inside Gemini, right? For example, if we say create a 60-second video with a story about a man going to
3:18:32
slay a dragon in the cave, it actually created all the video files here, but then it actually sliced them together
3:18:38
and put it inside this video. So, they've got a 60-second video. You can't do that inside V3, right? And now, if we
3:18:45
pull this up, we've got the video generated right here. This was actually an old one. So, this was a conversation
3:18:50
from a while back, but you get the point. Like, it's quite easy to generate videos, storyboards, etc. using this
3:18:56
process I'm showing you today. and then you can stitch everything together, right? Whereas inside Gemini, Gemini is
3:19:02
not going to stitch stuff together for you directly, right? So that's one of the biggest differences here. But you get this like Game of Thrones feel for
3:19:09
the content that you're creating, right? And it's really easy to do. Really easy to do step by step. Says, "If you're free, you should expl explore Amazon
3:19:16
Bedrock. There are more than 50 LMS." Yeah, I heard Amazon Bedrock is pretty good. Actually, the new Claude update
3:19:21
for the million tokens context window that was only available in two places. Claude Code and Amazon Bedrock. It
3:19:27
wasn't available anywhere else. That dude says, "What LM will allow us to schedule an agent to dedicate a task?" I
3:19:34
can't remember if you can do scheduled tasks now inside Gemini. I think you might be able to. Yeah. So, you can
3:19:39
launch like scheduled actions it's called. I haven't actually tested that. That is interesting. So, let's say okay,
3:19:46
I'm going to go in here. New chat. Let's see if it's one of the options. I've never tested this out. We're going to say, okay, schedule check in AI news
3:19:53
every day. something like that. See if it works. But yeah, for me, I mean, for scheduling, like the best thing is
3:19:59
honestly like just a Google doc with your plan. That's what I do every day. Like I plan it out every 30 minutes. If
3:20:04
you want to get a copy of that, then you can actually go inside the AR profit volume. Just drop me a DM and I'll get that daily planner to you. But
3:20:11
essentially inside here, you can schedule check in different tasks here. So you can say, okay, done. I will
3:20:17
schedule AI news for you every day. Ask me to edit or delete the scheduled thing. You'll get a notification when it's ready. And then if we edit this,
3:20:23
right, we can actually edit the schedule, the instructions, AI news, and we can delete that task as well, right? So if you don't want that prompt to run,
3:20:30
you can just delete it and then boom, you're ready to go. So that's actually pretty cool. I didn't even realize Gemini could do that. So that was really
3:20:36
cool. Which AI system is currently the best for coding? I really love Gemini. If you're building something basic, even
3:20:41
if you're building something more complex, then I would say Claude or Gemini, but Gemini tends to have it's
3:20:46
got three APIs for coding, so you know, you can't argue with that. DT says, "I find Plexi the best scheduling." Dot
3:20:52
says, "Coding debugging." Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, if you want to like debug and that sort of thing, then I would recommend Claude CLI or Google
3:21:01
CLI. You can also use chat GPT codeex. That's pretty good for coding and that sort of thing. DT recommends cl code and
3:21:07
says, "Is Gemini adding code assist similar to CL code?" So, you've got Gemini CLI, right? I've got a video on
3:21:13
this inside the AR profit boardroom if you want this, but you can use Gemini CLI and that's like an open free way to
3:21:20
code. If you want the training on that, just go inside the AR profit boardroom, then go to Google CRI update and we walk
3:21:26
you through exactly like how to install it, how to set it up, etc. So, it's pretty good. Very similar to CL code. Yeah. Cool. All right. So, thanks so
3:21:33
much for watching. If you want to get access to all of my best trainings, including the training from today inside
3:21:39
the SAP section, you can grab it right here. to just go to the classroom s boom you got this and we have all these new

3:23:49
free. Google just dropped three huge updates to Gemini and they're all completely free. Today, I'm going to
3:23:55
show you how Gemini can now remember everything you tell it across all your chats. No more repeating yourself ever
3:24:00
again. Plus, there's a brand new temporary chat mode that keeps your private stuff totally private. And wait until you see the new storybook feature
3:24:06
that creates full stories with pictures from just one prompt. This is going to change everything about how you use AI.
3:24:12
Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency, Goldie Agency. Whilst he's
3:24:19
helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. And before we dive
3:24:25
in, Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below and let us know which of these three new
3:24:30
features excites you the most. So, let's start with the biggest update that honestly blew my mind when I saw it.
3:24:36
Google just rolled out a personalization feature that lets Gemini remember your past conversations. Think about this for
3:24:42
a second. How many times have you had to tell Chat GPT or Claude the same information over and over again? You
3:24:47
start a new chat and you're back to explaining what your business does, what your goals are, what your preferences
3:24:52
are. Well, Google just solved that problem completely. Here's how it works. There's a new setting in Gemini that
3:24:57
when you turn it on, it remembers key details and preferences from all your previous chats. So, if you tell it once
3:25:03
that you run a marketing agency focused on local businesses, it remembers that forever. If you mention you prefer short
3:25:09
bullet point answers instead of long paragraphs, it remembers that, too. This means every conversation gets smarter
3:25:14
and more personalized. It's like having an AI assistant that actually knows you instead of meeting a stranger every time
3:25:20
you open a new chat. But here's the crazy part. This isn't just for paid users. This is rolling out to everyone
3:25:25
starting with the 2.5 Pro model. That's the free version of Gemini. Google is literally giving away features that
3:25:31
other AI companies charge premium prices for. Now, let me show you exactly how this changes everything. Before this
3:25:37
update, if I wanted help with my YouTube strategy, I'd have to explain my channel size, my niche, my goals, my target
3:25:43
audience, everything from scratch every single time. But now, Gemini already knows I run an SEO agency. It knows I
3:25:50
create AI content. It knows my subscriber count and engagement rates. So, when I ask for YouTube ideas, it
3:25:57
gives me suggestions that are actually relevant to my specific situation. This is huge for business owners because now
3:26:02
you can build a real relationship with your AI assistant. It learns your writing style, your business model, your customer base, everything. And the more
3:26:08
you use it, the better it gets. It's like having a business partner that never forgets anything and gets smarter
3:26:13
every day. But wait, there's more. Because Google also just launched something called temporary chat. And this solves a problem that nobody was
3:26:19
talking about, but everyone was thinking about. Sometimes you want to ask your AI assistant something private. Maybe you're planning a surprise for someone.
3:26:26
Maybe you're working on a confidential project. Maybe you just want to brainstorm ideas without it affecting your main conversation history. Well,
3:26:32
now you can. Temporary chat lets you have conversations that don't get saved anywhere. Uh they don't show up in your
3:26:37
recent chats. They don't get used to train the AI. They don't affect your personalization settings. It's like
3:26:43
having a private conversation that disappears after 72 hours. Think about how powerful this is. You can use your
3:26:49
main Gemini account for all your regular business stuff, where you want it to remember everything, but then switch to
3:26:54
temporary mode when you need privacy. This gives you the best of both worlds. Personalization when you want it,
3:27:00
privacy when you need it. And here's something most people don't realize. This temporary chat feature isn't just about privacy. It's also perfect for
3:27:06
testing different approaches without messing up your main AI relationship. Want to try a completely different
3:27:11
writing style? Use temporary chat. Want to experiment with a new business idea without confusing your AI about your
3:27:17
main focus? Temporary chat. Want to ask questions about a competitor without it affecting how Gemini sees your own
3:27:23
business? You guessed it, temporary chat. And speaking of getting the most out of AI, if you want to learn how to
3:27:29
use these tools to actually make money, I've got something special for you. I've put together a complete AI training program called the AI Money Lab. The
3:27:35
link is in the comments and description below. This covers everything from setting up these AI tools to turning them into profit generating machines for
3:27:43
your business. Now, let's talk about the third update that honestly surprised me the most. It's called Storybook, and it's unlike anything I've seen before.
3:27:49
Storybook lets you create complete illustrated stories from just a simple prompt. And I'm not talking about just text stories. I'm talking about stories
3:27:56
with custom images, drawings, and illustrations that match your exact vision. Here's how wild this is. You can
3:28:01
type something like, "Create a story about a dog who learns to code," and Gemini will generate a full story with pictures. But here's the kicker. You can
3:28:08
add your own photos and drawings, too. So, if you have a picture of your actual dog, you can upload it and Gemini will create a story featuring your real dog
3:28:14
as the main character. Your dog becomes the hero of a custom illustrated story. Now, you might be thinking, "This is
3:28:20
just for fun, but let me blow your mind with the business applications here. Content creators can use this to generate illustrated blog posts. Social
3:28:26
media managers can create engaging story content with custom visuals. Authors can prototype their children's books.
3:28:31
Educators can create custom learning materials with relevant illustrations. And here's something crazy. This works
3:28:36
in over 45 languages. So if you're targeting international markets, you can create story content in Spanish, French,
3:28:42
German, whatever language your audience speaks. But the real power is in combining all three of these features together. Imagine this workflow. You use
3:28:49
the personalization feature to teach Gemini about your business and your content style. Then you use Storybook to
3:28:54
create illustrated content that matches your brand. And when you want to experiment with different approaches, you switch to temporary chat so it
3:29:00
doesn't mess up your main settings. This is like having a whole content creation team built into one AI assistant. And
3:29:07
remember, all of this is rolling out to the free version of Gemini. Google is basically giving away what will cost
3:29:12
hundreds of dollars per month with other AI platforms. But here's what most people are going to miss. These aren't just individual features. They're
3:29:19
building blocks for a completely new way of working with AI. The personalization means your AI gets smarter over time.
3:29:25
The temporary chat means you can experiment without consequences. And storybook means you can create rich
3:29:30
multimedia content without needing design skills. Put them together and you have an AI assistant that knows you
3:29:36
personally, protects your privacy when needed, and can create professional content in minutes. Now, let me share
3:29:41
some specific ways you can use these features starting today. For the personalization feature, start by having
3:29:46
a conversation where you explain your business model, your goals, and your preferences. Be specific. Tell it
3:29:52
exactly how you like information presented, what your target audience looks like, what your biggest challenges are. The more detail you give it up
3:29:57
front, the better every future conversation will be. Think of it as training your personal AI assistant for temporary chat. Use it anytime you're
3:30:04
working on something confidential. Planning a product launch, temporary chat, researching competitors, temporary
3:30:09
chat, testing new marketing angles, temporary chat. And for storybook, start thinking beyond just stories. This is a
3:30:17
content creation tool disguised as a storytelling feature. You can create illustrated tutorials, visual case
3:30:22
studies, engaging social media content, whatever your business needs. Here's a concrete example. Let's say you run a
3:30:28
fitness business. You could use Storybook to create an illustrated guide showing a client's transformation journey. Upload before and after photos
3:30:35
and let Gemini create a motivational story around that transformation. Or if you're in real estate, create
3:30:40
illustrated stories about families finding their dream homes. Use actual property photos and let Gemini weave
3:30:45
them into compelling narratives. The possibilities are endless once you start thinking creatively. But here's the
3:30:51
thing that excites me most about these updates. Google isn't just adding features. They're reimagining what AI
3:30:57
assistants should look like. Most AI tools treat every conversation like you're starting from zero. But that's
3:31:03
not how human relationships work. When you work with a real assistant, they remember what you told them yesterday. They understand your preferences. They
3:31:10
know your business. Now AI is finally catching up to that reality. And the timing couldn't be better. We're in the
3:31:15
middle of an AI revolution where every business needs to figure out how to use these tools effectively. The companies
3:31:21
that master AI assistants will have a massive advantage over those that don't. These new Gemini features give you that
3:31:27
advantage for free. Now, I want to address something important. Some people are worried about AI remembering their conversations. They think it's creepy or
3:31:33
invasive. But here's the reality. You're in complete control. The personalization feature is optional. You can turn it off
3:31:39
anytime. And with temporary chat, you can have private conversations whenever you want. This isn't about giving up
3:31:44
privacy. It's about having choice. You choose when to share information and when to keep things private. and the
3:31:50
benefits far outweigh any concerns. Having an AI that knows your business context means better suggestions, more
3:31:56
relevant ideas, and faster results. Instead of spending time explaining the same things over and over, you can focus
3:32:01
on getting actual work done. Here's something else that's important. These features work together to solve different problems you face throughout
3:32:07
your day. Morning planning session, where you want personalized suggestions based on your goals. Use the regular
3:32:12
personalized mode. Midday brainstorming session about a confidential project. Switch to temporary chat. afternoon
3:32:19
content creation where you need illustrated materials, fire up storybook. It's like having three different AI assistants optimized for
3:32:26
different types of work. And because it's all in one platform, you don't need to learn multiple tools or pay for multiple subscriptions. Now, let me talk
3:32:32
about what this means for the future. Google is clearly positioning Gemini as more than just a chatbot. They're
3:32:37
building a comprehensive AI workplace assistant. These three features are just the beginning. I expect we'll see
3:32:43
integration with Google Workspace tools, advanced project management features, and even more sophisticated
3:32:48
personalization options. The companies that start mastering these tools now will be way ahead when the next wave of features drops. But you don't need to
3:32:55
wait for future updates to get value. These three features available right now can transform how you work. Start with
3:33:01
the personalization feature. Spend 30 minutes having a detailed conversation with Gemini about your business. Tell it
3:33:06
everything, your industry, your customers, your goals, your challenges, your preferred communication style. Then
3:33:11
start using it for your daily tasks and watch how much better the responses get. When you need privacy, switch to
3:33:16
temporary chat. When you need illustrated content, use Story Book. It's that simple. And if you want to take this even further, I've got two
3:33:23
resources that will help you maximize these AI tools. First, check out my AI profit boardroom. This is the best place
3:33:29
to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with AI automation. We currently have
3:33:34
over 1,000 members who are all using AI to grow their businesses faster than ever before. Second, if you want a
3:33:41
personalized strategy for your specific business, I'm offering free SEO strategy sessions. The link is in the comments
3:33:47
and description below. We'll analyze your current situation and show you exactly how to use AI tools like these
3:33:53
new Gemini features to get more traffic and customers. And finally, if you want step-by-step instructions for everything
3:33:59
I covered today, we have a complete SOP and process inside the AI money lab. The link is in the comments and description
3:34:05
with over 100 different use cases and tutorials. You can see how we have a checklist of 100 different tutorials
3:34:11
that get added as bonuses every day inside the community. You also get all the video notes from content like this,
3:34:16
plus uh advanced trainings that aren't available anywhere else. Plus, the AI Money Lab has over 19,000 members, so
3:34:21
you'll be joining a massive community of people who are all focused on using AI to grow their businesses. The bottom
3:34:27
line is this. Google just gave you three incredibly powerful AI features for free. The personalization feature alone
3:34:33
would be worth paying for with other platforms, but you're getting it all at no cost. The question isn't whether
3:34:39
these tools are valuable. The question is whether you'll actually use them. Most people will watch this video, think the features are cool, and then go back
3:34:45
to doing things the old way. Don't be most people. Start using these features today. Set up the personalization. Try
3:34:51
temporary chat for your next confidential project. Experiment with Storybook for your content creation. The
3:34:57
businesses that embrace AI first are the ones that will dominate their industries. Make sure you're one of them. Thanks for watching and I'll see
3:35:03
you in the next one. Gemini 3.0, the wildest leaks and rumors so far. The internet is going crazy over Gemini 3.0
3:35:10
leaks right now. We got code leaks. We got benchmark rumors. We got hardware hints. But here's the thing. None of
3:35:16
this is official yet. These are all rumors and leaks, but they're everywhere right now. Today, I'm going to show you
3:35:21
everything we know. The leaked code, the rumored scores, and why these unconfirmed reports could change
3:35:26
everything. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie
3:35:33
Agency, whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers. I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. And
3:35:39
listen, Julian Goldie reads every comment. So, make sure you comment below and let us know what you think about
3:35:44
these Gemini 3.0 rumors. Now, before we dive in, I need to be super clear about something. Google has not officially
3:35:51
announced Gemini 3.0. Everything I'm about to share comes from leaks, rumors, and speculation. None of this is
3:35:57
confirmed by Google, but here's why these rumors are getting so much attention. Someone found code references
3:36:03
to Gemini 3.0 Flash and Gemini 3.0 Pro inside Google's own tools. This isn't
3:36:09
some random rumor. This is leaked code from Google's own systems talking about models that don't officially exist yet.
3:36:14
The leaked code showed up in the Gemini CLI repository. That's basically Google's command line tool for
3:36:20
developers. And right there in the leaked code were references to Gemini Beta 3.0 Pro and Gemini Beta 3.0 Flash.
3:36:28
This leaked code is the loudest real world signal that 3.0 is close. When you see beta versions in leaked Google code,
3:36:35
that suggests they're testing it internally. But remember, this is a leak, not an official announcement. Now,
3:36:41
here's where the rumors get really wild. A widely shared but unconfirmed source code scraped from Open Insights on X
3:36:47
claims Gemini 3.0 score 32.4% 4% on something called humanity's last exam.
3:36:53
According to these viral but unverified numbers, GPT5 supposedly got 26.5%.
3:36:59
Grock 4 got 23.9% but Gemini 3.0 32.4%.
3:37:04
Now, I got to be super clear here. These benchmark numbers are completely unconfirmed rumors. The claim says the
3:37:10
numbers were visible in leaked source code, but there's no official confirmation from Google, no research papers, no blog posts, just screenshots
3:37:17
and social media posts. But if these rumors turn out to be true, that would be a massive jump over the competition.
3:37:23
Now, before we go deeper, I want to tell you about something that can help you stay ahead of all these AI changes. It's my AI Money Lab community. This is where
3:37:29
I share all the latest AI tools, strategies, and updates. We have over 19,000 members who are using AI to grow
3:37:35
their businesses, and save hundreds of hours every week. Inside, you get access to over 100 AI use cases, step-by-step
3:37:42
tutorials, SOPs for every major AI tool. Plus, you get all my video notes and training materials. The link is in the
3:37:48
comments and description below. And right now, we're giving away free checklists and tutorials every day inside the community feed. When you see
3:37:54
how many people are already using AI to transform their businesses, you're going to want to be part of something bigger
3:37:59
than yourself. So, let's talk about what these rumors and leaks might mean for you and your business. Here's what makes
3:38:04
these rumors even more interesting. The leaked hardware details. Reports on leaked information that Pixel 10 could
3:38:09
have big on device Gemini features that might ship first with rumored 3.0 era models. Camera Coach and conversational
3:38:16
photo editing keep showing up in leaked promo materials and reports. They say leaked information suggests the Pixel 10
3:38:22
could radically change the way you take photos. According to these rumors, you'd point your camera at something and
3:38:27
Gemini tells you how to get the perfect. This isn't just one outlet reporting rumors. Multiple sources are leaking the
3:38:32
same information. And here's what's wild about these leaked details. This isn't just about taking photos. The leaked
3:38:38
information says Gemini will do conversational photo editing. You could literally talk to your phone about how
3:38:43
to edit your pictures, but leaked camera features are just the start. Android Central also reports on leaked Pixel
3:38:49
Watch 4 information showing rumored Gemini style assistant on your wrist with style mirroring and contextual
3:38:56
help. That suggests deeper personalization hooks in the rumored 3.0 generation. So, what do these leaks and
3:39:02
rumors tell us about Gemini 3.0? If true, it means Google is building an AI that understands everything around you.
3:39:08
your camera, your watch, your phone, your whole digital life. Now, let me tell you what the speculation says about
3:39:13
the rumored features of Gemini 3.0, because this is where the rumors get really crazy. The community threads all
3:39:19
point to speculative feature sets that cluster around three main themes: bigger context, deeper multimodal, built-in
3:39:25
planning, and tool use. But remember, these are all rumors and speculation, not confirmed facts. First up is rumored
3:39:31
bigger context windows. People speculate an increase beyond the 1 million token context at 2.5 advertisers. both guess
3:39:36
multi-million contexts with smarter memory and retrieval. If these rumors are true, imagine uploading 50 documents
3:39:42
about your business and asking Gemini to create a strategy. It reads everything and gives you a plan based on all that
3:39:47
data. But context is just the beginning of the speculation. The second big rumor is built-in planning. Less need to
3:39:54
toggle a special thinking mode. Right now, when you ask an AI to do something complex, it often messes up. If the
3:39:59
Gemini 3.0 rumors are true, it might have planning built right in. It thinks through the entire process before it
3:40:04
starts. And here's the third rumored feature. Stronger real-time multimodal video understanding live camera analysis
3:40:10
on device actions. This connects to Google's project Astra. Their official page shows memory and perception coming
3:40:15
into product lines. Axios did hands-on coverage. YouTube has demo clips showing what this looks like. If the rumors are
3:40:22
accurate, you'll be walking around with your phone. Gemini sees what you see through your camera. It can help you
3:40:27
understand what you're looking at in real time. But wait, there's more speculation. One of the coolest rumors is about going from sketch to software.
3:40:34
Google already has a code lab showing you can draw a website layout on paper, take a photo, and get working code. Live
3:40:39
blog mentions updating code from a sketch, but rumored Gemini 3.0 might make this faster and more reliable.
3:40:45
According to speculation, you could sketch an entire app idea and watch it come to life in seconds. YouTube has
3:40:51
community examples showing this in action. Reddit threads talk about open- source agent tools that mention Sketch and PDF to app features. If these rumors
3:40:58
are true, think about what that means for business owners, for entrepreneurs. You wouldn't need to know how to code.
3:41:04
You just need to know how to draw. And speaking of creating things, reports on actual updates about image and media generation upgrades. Imagine Trees is
3:41:11
already in Gemini apps. They expect tighter integration and story-like outputs across devices. How the app can now make personalized illustrated story
3:41:18
books with narration. Android Central calls this a new level of imagination for bedtime updates. You can literally
3:41:23
draw something simple and Gemini turns into a full illustrated story book. That shows how fast Gemini is moving on
3:41:29
creative media. And this part isn't a rumor. It's actually working now. Now, here's where I need to give you the full picture about what's confirmed versus
3:41:35
what's speculation. Real evidence, leaked code references to Gemini 3.0
3:41:40
Flash and Pro. This is hard evidence from leaked Google code. When leaked internal code mentions these models,
3:41:45
this suggests they exist internally, real evidence, consistent leaked details on Camera Coach and related AI features
3:41:52
for the August 20th made by Google event in New York. When multiple outlets leak the same information, that's usually
3:41:57
legit. Unconfirmed rumors. The humanity's last exam numbers from open insights on X. There's no paper from
3:42:03
Google. There's no blog. Only screenshots and posts. Unconfirmed rumors. Release date chatter. Prediction
3:42:10
markets point to late CO3 or December preview, but there's no official word from Google. Pure speculation. The
3:42:16
Reddit community mentions a December preview rumor. Manifold markets show betting odds on rumors, but use this as
3:42:22
speculation only. If even half of these Gemini 3.0 rumors turn out to be true, we're looking at a massive shift in how
3:42:28
we work. Think about content creation. If the rumors about bigger context and better planning are accurate, you could
3:42:34
describe what you want and watch it get created in minutes. Think about the sketch to software feature. Google's
3:42:39
code lab already shows you can draw your app idea and get working code. But if the 3.0 rumors are true, it might become
3:42:45
instant and way more reliable. Think about the rumored camera coach feature coming to Pixel 10. If accurate, that's
3:42:51
like having a professional photographer in your pocket telling you how to get the perfect shot. And the storybook feature. That one's not a rumor. It's
3:42:57
working now. You draw something with your kid and Gemini creates a narrated illustrated book in 30 seconds. Now
3:43:02
imagine that same power for business presentations or marketing materials. Here's another angle from the leaks. The
3:43:08
rumored integration with Google's hardware ecosystem. If these leaks are accurate, your Pixel phone, Pixel Watch,
3:43:13
and other devices would all have the same Gemini brain. They could work together in ways we haven't seen before. Your watch notices something. Your phone
3:43:20
responds. Your camera understands context. All working together seamlessly. But remember, much of this
3:43:27
is speculation based on leaks and rumors. So what should you do while we wait for official news? First, start
3:43:32
experimenting with current AI tools. The Sketch 2 software feature is already available through Google's code lab. Try
3:43:38
it out. Second, check out the storybook feature that 9 to5 Google covers if you have access. It shows where Creative AI
3:43:44
is heading. And this one isn't a rumor, it's real. Third, think about how these rumored features might impact your
3:43:49
business. Better planning, bigger context, real-time understanding. If the rumors are true, how would you use those
3:43:55
capabilities? And fourth, stay informed, but focus on what's available today.
3:44:00
Don't wait for rumored tools that might not arrive on schedule. That's actually why I created the AI profit boardroom.
3:44:06
It's the best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with AI automation.
3:44:12
And we currently have over 1,000 members who are using AI to transform their businesses. They're getting real results
3:44:17
with tools that work right now, not rumors or speculation. The link is in the comments and description if you want
3:44:23
to learn more. And if you're serious about SEO and digital marketing, I also offer free SEO strategy sessions. We'll
3:44:29
analyze your website and show you exactly how to get more traffic and leads. Again, the link is in the comments and description below. In and
3:44:35
speaking of staying ahead, we also have a complete SOP and process inside the AI
3:44:40
money lab. The link is in the comments and description with over 100 different use cases. You see how I show a
3:44:46
checklist of 100 different tutorials that we give away as freebies every day inside the school feed. You can get all
3:44:52
the video notes from there and all the other resources along with all the trainings in the AI money lab. On top of
3:44:57
that, we now have 19,000 members because people feel like they're missing out and they want to be part of something bigger
3:45:03
than themselves. Now, let me wrap this up with what I think is really happening here based on these leaks and rumors.
3:45:08
Google found itself in an AI race instead of just building a better chatbot. The rumors suggest they're building an AI ecosystem, phone and
3:45:16
watch camera apps, everything connected. The Gemini 3.0 rumors suggest this
3:45:21
strategy is working. Leaked code that understand sketches according to Google's code lab. Rumored cameras that
3:45:27
coach you. Rumored watches that help contextually according to leaked hardware details. If these rumors are
3:45:32
accurate, that's not just AI. That's AI woven into your daily life. Will the rumors pan out exactly as described?
3:45:38
Probably not. Tech rumors rarely match reality perfectly. But will Google release something impressive in the
3:45:43
rumored 3.0 time frame? Leaked code references and Android Central's leaked hardware details suggest yes. The
3:45:50
question isn't whether Gemini 3.0 is coming. The leaked code proves they're working on it internally. The question
3:45:56
is what exactly it will do and when we'll see it officially announced. Based on everything we've covered today from
3:46:02
all these leaked sources and rumors, I'd say the smart speculation is on late 2025 for at least a preview. Maybe
3:46:08
sooner if the competitive pressure builds, and when it does arrive officially, it could change how we think about AI integration, not just as a tool
3:46:15
you visit occasionally, but has intelligence built into everything you use. What do you think? Are these Gemini

3:46:42
I'll see you in the next one. GPT5 versus Claude 4.1 Opus versus Gemini 2.5
3:46:48
Pro. Who wins? Today I'm going to show you which AI actually wins when you put them head-to-head. I tested GPT5, Claude
3:46:56
Opus 4.1, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on the same exact tasks. The results will shock you.
3:47:01
One AI completely crashed three times in a row. Another one kept making the same mistakes over and over. But one AI
3:47:08
surprised me with something I never expected. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of
3:47:13
Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to
3:47:20
help you get the latest AI updates. Here's what happened when I put these three AI giants to the test. I gave them
3:47:27
all the exact same challenge. Build me five different games, same rules, same time limit, same everything. The
3:47:33
question everyone's asking is simple. Which AI is actually better? GPT5 just dropped. Claude Opus 4.1 is making waves
3:47:41
and Gemini 2.5 Pro claims to be the smartest yet. But here's the thing. Everyone talks about these AE is. Nobody
3:47:48
actually tests them properly. So, I did what nobody else would do. I put them through real challenges, not simple
3:47:55
questions, not basic tasks, real work that matters. What I found will change how you think about AI forever. Let me
3:48:02
start with the first test. I asked all three A's to build a game called Pixel Ninja Dash. The goal was simple. Create
3:48:08
a single page app where you dash and jump across rooftops while slicing enemy robots. Sounds easy, right? Wrong.
3:48:16
Here's what happened. Gemini finished first. The UI looked good, but the game was so hard to play, I wanted to throw
3:48:22
my computer out the window. GPT5 came second. Again, nice UI, but just like
3:48:28
Gemini, way too hard to actually enjoy. Then Claude Opus 4.1 finished last. Uh,
3:48:33
but here's the twist. The game was actually fun to play. Easy controls, nice night city lights, cute background.
3:48:40
While the other two made games that looked good but felt terrible, Claude made something you'd actually want to play. This tells us something important.
3:48:46
Speed doesn't always win. Pretty doesn't always work. Sometimes the AI that takes longer makes something better. But wait,
3:48:53
it gets more interesting. Test two was candy match blast. Match three candies. Score points. Beat the clock. Standard
3:49:00
match three game that everyone knows. Gemini finished first again. But there was an error. The game didn't work. So
3:49:06
while I waited for Gemini to fix it, Claude finished. And holy cow, instead of regular candy graphics, Claude used
3:49:13
emojis, chocolates, candies, sweets. It looked completely different from what the others made. GPT5 finished next. The
3:49:21
design was like painted balls. Pretty and polished. It worked well. Finally, Gemini fixed its error and came last.
3:49:27
When it finally worked, I wasn't impressed. The design was boring compared to the others. Claude won this round. Not because it was fastest,
3:49:34
because it was creative. It thought outside the box. It made something unique while the others played it safe.
3:49:39
This is where most people get AI wrong. They think faster means better. They think first place means best, but what
3:49:46
actually matters is results. What matters is whether the thing you ask for
3:49:51
actually works the way you need it to. Test three was jungle run adventure. Run
3:49:57
and jump across jungle platforms. Collect bananas. Avoid traps. Infinite
3:50:02
terrain that gets faster as you play. Here's where things got messy. All three AIs failed on the first try. Every
3:50:08
single one had errors. So, I gave them all a second chance. Claude finished first this time. The game design looked
3:50:14
good, but there were no bananas, no collectibles, just a monkey running. I gave it another chance. The second
3:50:20
version didn't work at all. Gemini came next. It worked most of the time, but sometimes the space bar didn't respond.
3:50:26
Sometimes you couldn't jump. And instead of bananas, it made yellow balls. I'm not kidding. Yellow balls instead of
3:50:31
bananas. GPT5 came last. The game crashed completely three times. It just
3:50:36
couldn't handle this challenge at all. This test showed me something crucial. When AIs fail, they fail differently.
3:50:42
Some fail fast and recover. Some fail slow but work eventually. Some just keep
3:50:47
failing no matter what you do. But here's what's really happening behind the scenes. Each AI has different
3:50:53
strengths, different ways of thinking about problems, different approaches to code. And here's where you need to pay
3:50:59
attention because the next test changed everything. Test four was Space Miner
3:51:05
3D. Fly a spaceship through asteroids, collect crystals, don't crash, use 3.js
3:51:10
JS for 3D graphics. Gemini finished first. Nothing special. Standard game. GPT5 came second. Also nothing special.
3:51:18
Same basic approach. But Claude came last. At first it showed errors. I thought it failed again. But then I
3:51:24
realized something. The game was actually working and it looked way better than the other two. Despite the initial errors, Claude had built
3:51:30
something more impressive. This taught me the biggest lesson of all. Don't judge an AI by its first response. Don't
3:51:36
judge it by how fast it works. Judge it by the final result. You know what? Most business owners get wrong about AI. They
3:51:42
pick the AI that gives them answers fastest. They want quick results, fast responses, instant gratification. But
3:51:49
that's like choosing a restaurant because they serve food fast. Speed doesn't mean quality. Speed doesn't mean
3:51:55
the food tastes good. Speed doesn't mean you'll be satisfied. The same is true with AI. The best AI isn't always the
3:52:02
fastest AI. Now, here's where you can transform your business with AI. Most people use AI wrong. They ask simple
3:52:08
questions. They want quick answers. They treat AI like a search engine. That's like buying a Ferrari and only driving
3:52:15
it to the grocery store. The real power of AI comes when you push it. When you give it complex challenges, when you
3:52:21
test its limits. And that's exactly what the AI success lab teaches you. How to use AI the right way. How to get results
3:52:27
that actually matter. How to save hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars with the right AI strategies.
3:52:33
Check the link in the comments and description. Over 14,000 members are already inside learning the advanced
3:52:39
techniques that most people never discover. But let me finish the story first because test 5 was the real eye
3:52:45
opener. Test 5 was Lava Escape Runner. Run across crumbling platforms while lava rises from below. Volcanic theme,
3:52:52
fiery colors, intense but not frustrating gameplay. Gemini finished first again, but guess what? Error
3:52:59
again. So I gave it time to fix it. Claude came second. The game worked. Sometimes the controls didn't respond
3:53:06
perfectly, but it was playable. It was fun. GPT5 came last, and this is where
3:53:11
it completely fell apart. Error after error after error, three times in a row, it just couldn't handle this challenge.
3:53:17
So, what does all this mean? Which AI actually wins? Here's the truth. There is no single winner. Each AI has
3:53:24
different strengths. Gemini is fast, but makes more errors. GPT5 is polished, but
3:53:30
struggles with complex tasks. Claude is creative and often builds better final products, even if it takes longer. But
3:53:36
here's what really matters for your business. You need to know which AI to use for which task. For quick, simple
3:53:41
tasks, Gemini might be your best bet. For polished standard work, GPT5 could work well. For creative complex
3:53:47
projects, Claude often surprises you with something better. Most people don't know this. They pick one AI and stick
3:53:53
with it. That's like using a hammer for every job. Sometimes you need a screwdriver. Sometimes you need a saw.
3:53:58
The businesses that are winning with AI right now understand this. They use different AIs for different purposes.
3:54:05
They know when to use which tool. And that's exactly what we teach inside the AI success lab. Not just how to use one
3:54:12
AI, but how to use all of them. How to pick the right tool for each job. How to get results that your competitors can't
3:54:18
match. You see how I show a checklist of 100 different tutorials that were given away as freebies every day inside the
3:54:24
school feed. That's just the beginning. You get all the video notes, all the strategies, all the techniques that took
3:54:30
me years to figure out. Plus, you join 14,000 other members who are all learning and sharing the latest AI
3:54:37
breakthroughs. When you're part of something bigger than yourself, you learn faster, you grow faster, you get
3:54:42
results faster. Here's what this really means for you. AI isn't just about getting quick answers anymore. It's
3:54:47
about building systems, creating processes, automating tasks that used to take hours. The companies that figure
3:54:53
this out first will dominate their markets. The ones that don't will be left behind. I've seen it happen
3:54:59
already. Businesses that used to spend thousands on content creation now do it for pennies. Companies that used to hire
3:55:05
expensive developers now build apps with AI. Entrepreneurs who used to struggle with marketing now create campaigns that
3:55:11
convert like crazy, but only if they know how to use AI properly. That's why I created the AI Profit Boardroom. is
3:55:18
the best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with AI automation. We currently
3:55:24
have 1,000 members who are all transforming their businesses with AI. These aren't just people playing around
3:55:30
with Chat GBT. These are serious entrepreneurs who are using AI to build real wealth, real systems, real
3:55:37
businesses that run themselves. Inside the boardroom, you get access to strategies that most people will never
3:55:43
discover. You get templates and systems that took years to develop. You get a community of people who are all on the
3:55:49
same mission as you. Here's the bottom line. AI is changing everything, but most people are using it wrong. They're
3:55:55
getting surface level results when they could be getting life-changing outcomes. The difference is knowing what to do,
3:56:01
knowing which AI to use when, knowing how to structure your prompts, knowing how to build systems that actually work.
3:56:08
And honestly, you can't figure this out by yourself. The landscape changes too fast. New AIs launch every month. New
3:56:15
features drop every week. New strategies emerge every day. That's why you need a community. That's why you need training.
3:56:21
That's why you need guidance from people who are already getting results. If you want to book a free SEO strategy

3:57:23
Today, I'm going to show you the ultimate AI coding battle that everyone's talking about. Four AI giants
3:57:29
are about to fight for the coding crown. I tested them on seven crazy hard challenges that will blow your mind. You
3:57:36
won't believe which AI destroyed the competition. This is the test that reveals the truth about AI coding in
3:57:41
2025. Get ready because the results are shocking. Hey, if we haven't met
3:57:46
already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency, Goldie
3:57:52
Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. So,
3:58:00
here's what happened. I decided to run the ultimate test. Four of the most powerful AI models on the planet, all
3:58:06
fighting for one thing. The title of best AI coder, we've got Quen 3-235B-
3:58:13
A22B-2507. This is Alibaba's brand new monster just
3:58:18
dropped and it's already making waves. This thing is their latest coding powerhouse that's designed to compete
3:58:25
with the best. Then we have Claude for Opus, Anthropics coding beast. They
3:58:30
claim it's the world's best coding model. It can code for 7 hours straight without stopping. And that's like having
3:58:36
a developer who never gets tired. Next up is Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google's latest
3:58:41
and greatest. This model is supposed to be revolutionary. Google says it can handle any coding challenge you throw at
3:58:48
it. And finally, Gro 4. This is the wild card. It's got that X factor that might surprise everyone. Here's the thing,
3:58:54
though. Everyone talks about which AI is best, but nobody runs real tests. They just look at benchmarks, but benchmarks
3:59:01
don't tell the whole story. You need real world challenges. So, I created seven brutal tests. These
3:59:07
aren't simple coding tasks. These are the kind of projects that separate the winners from the losers. Let me tell you
3:59:13
about test number one. HTML game with falling objects clicker. Here's the exact prompt I gave each AI. Build a
3:59:21
simple HTML and JavaScript game where objects fall from the top of the screen and the player has to click them before
3:59:27
they hit the ground. The game should include a start screen, score tracking, increasing difficulty over time, and
3:59:33
work well on both desktop and mobile. I asked each AI to build a complete game, not just some basic code, a real game
3:59:40
with all these features. This is where things got interesting. Gemini came out swinging, super fast response. The game
3:59:46
actually worked. You could play it right away. No bugs, no crashes, just pure gaming goodness. Quen 3 coder was next.
3:59:54
Built almost the same game. Pretty solid stuff. The mechanics worked great. Grock 4 followed with similar output. Nothing
4:00:00
groundbreaking, but it did the job. But here's the twist. Claude 4 Opus was last
4:00:06
to finish, but when I saw the UI, my jaw dropped. It was completely different from the others. Better design, cleaner
4:00:12
interface, more professional looking. So, round one goes to Gemini for speed and functionality. But Claude gets style
4:00:18
points. Test number two was brutal. A it tool landing page. The prompt was,
4:00:24
"Create a clean, modern landing page using only HTML and CSS for a fictional AI tool called Prompt Pilot. It should
4:00:31
include a catchy headline, sub headline, hero, image, placeholder, a section with three features using icons, a
4:00:37
testimonial carousel, and a bold animated call to action button. I wanted a complete landing page for this fake AI
4:00:44
tool. Had to be modern, clean with all these specific elements. Gemini strikes
4:00:50
again, first to finish, the landing page looks amazing. Great font combinations, professional design. This thing could
4:00:56
fool anyone into thinking it was a real product. Quen came next, but the page was super plain. The text color was so
4:01:02
light you could barely see it. Major fail on the user experience front. Grock 4 delivered something basic, not
4:01:07
impressive. Looked like a landing page from 2015. Claude 4 Opus came last again, but wow,
4:01:13
the UI was gorgeous. Perfect color choices, professional layout. If I was running a real AI company, I'd use this
4:01:19
design. Here's what I'm seeing. Gemini is fast and functional. Claude is slow but beautiful. Quen 3-235B-
4:01:27
A22B-2507 is hit or miss. Grock is basic. Test
4:01:32
three changed everything. Multiplayer tic-tac-toe in the browser. Here's the prompt I used. Build a two-player
4:01:38
tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that works in real time via websockets or a similar method. It
4:01:44
should allow two users to play from different browsers with automatic wind detection and a restart option. This
4:01:51
wasn't just any tic-tac-toe game. This had to work in real time. Two players in different browsers, websocket
4:01:57
connections, wind detection, restart options. This is advanced stuff. Plot
4:02:02
twist. Quen 3-235B- A 22B-2507
4:02:08
finish first. And the game actually worked. Nice UI, smooth gameplay, everything functioned perfectly. Claude
4:02:15
came second, good UI, working game, solid performance. Grock 4 was supposed to deliver a game, but when I checked,
4:02:21
there was no game. Complete failure. Gemini came last with a working game, but the UI looked terrible. Functional,
4:02:28
but ugly. This is where Quen 3-235B- A22B-2507
4:02:34
showed its true power. When it comes to complex interactive applications, it's a beast. Test four was the browserbased
4:02:40
markdown editor. The prompt make a browserbased markdown editor using HTML,
4:02:46
CSS, and JavaScript. The page should have a split screen layout with a markdown input on the left and a live
4:02:52
preview on the right. Include buttons for bold, itallic, and links, and allow the user to export the content as a MD
4:02:58
file. Split screen layout, live preview, export functionality. This is developer
4:03:04
tool territory. Quen finish first. But here's the problem. And when I tried to preview anything, it threw errors. I
4:03:10
tried to fix it, but the errors kept coming. Total disaster. Gemini came next with a working Markdown editor. Clean,
4:03:16
functional, did exactly what it was supposed to do. Grock and Claude both built editors. But when you try to pace
4:03:22
basic HTML, neither would preview it properly. Both failed the real world test. So Gemini takes this round for
4:03:28
actually delivering something that works. Here's where things get crazy. Test five was portfolio website
4:03:34
generator. My prompt was build a simple web tool where a user can enter their name, skills, and project descriptions.
4:03:40
And when they click a generate button, it creates a styled onepage portfolio website, include an option to download
4:03:46
the generated HTML file. I wanted a tool where users could enter their info, click generate, and boom, a complete
4:03:54
portfolio website appears, plus the ability to download the HTML file. Jim and I finished first with a nice UI, but
4:04:01
it had a fatal flaw. It didn't respond to user input. Beautiful, but broken.
4:04:06
Quen had errors again. Starting to see a pattern here. Claude delivered something special. Good UI, working buttons,
4:04:12
responsive design. Actually did the job it was supposed to do. Grock had the same functionality as Claude, but the UI
4:04:19
looked basic. Still worked though. Claude wins this round for delivering both form and function. Test six blew my
4:04:25
mind. Tower defense game. Here's the prompt. Create a simple 2D tower defense game using HTML 5 canvas and JavaScript
4:04:33
where enemies follow a path and the player places towers to stop them. Include waves of increasing difficulty,
4:04:39
basic tower upgrades, and a game over screen. This isn't just a game. This is
4:04:44
a complete 2D tower defense system. Enemies following paths, towers that shoot, waves of increasing difficulty,
4:04:51
tower upgrades, game over screens. This is serious game development. Quen
4:04:56
finished first, but I couldn't figure out how to play the game. The UI was confusing. The mechanics weren't clear. It technically worked, but was unusable.
4:05:03
Then Gemini delivered something incredible. This felt like a real game. Professional fonts, smooth mechanics,
4:05:09
perfect UI. It was like playing a game from the app store. Absolutely insane for just one prompt. Gro's game didn't
4:05:16
work properly. Major disappointment. Claw did the job, but it could use improvement. Functional, but not
4:05:22
impressive. Gemini completely destroyed the competition here. No contest. Test seven was the ultimate challenge. First
4:05:28
person maze escape 3D game. The final prompt. Create a basic firstperson 3D
4:05:33
maze escape game in the browser using 3JS. The player should be able to move through a 3D maze using keyboard
4:05:40
controls WD. Find a key and unlock an exit door to win. I wanted a full 3D
4:05:46
maze game using 3JS. First person perspective keyboard controls with WD.
4:05:51
Find a key, unlock an exit door. win the game. This is professional game development territory. Gemini was
4:05:58
incredible. Created a full 3D maze that actually worked. You could move around, find the key, escape through the door.
4:06:04
It felt like playing a real video game. Quen showed just a brown background. No interaction. Complete failure. Claude
4:06:11
impressed me. Built a working 3D maze. You could navigate through it, find objectives, escape to win. Really solid
4:06:17
implementation. Grock just showed a white background. Another complete failure. Gemini wins again with the most
4:06:23
impressive 3D game. So, let's talk about what this all means. After running seven brutal tests, is what I discovered.
4:06:30
Gemini 2.5 Pro is the speed demon. Fast responses, great UI design. When it
4:06:36
works, it really works. Especially impressive with games and visual applications. Claude for Opus is the
4:06:44
perfectionist. takes longer to respond but delivers higher quality code, better UI designs, more professionallook
4:06:51
results. When you need something that looks good and works well, Claude delivers. Quen 3-235B-
4:06:57
A22B-2507 is the wild card. Sometimes it's brilliant. The multiplayer tic-tac-toe
4:07:04
was amazing, but sometimes it fails completely. Inconsistent, but has moments of genius. Grock 4 is the
4:07:10
underdog. Basic, but functional most of the time. Not exciting, but gets the job done for simple projects. Here's the
4:07:16
thing, though. The winner depends on what you need. If you want speed and impressive visual results, Gemini is
4:07:22
your choice. It's perfect for prototypes and demos that need to wow people. If you want professional quality code that
4:07:29
looks good and works reliably, Claude for Opus is the winner. Yes, it's slower, but the results are worth
4:07:35
waiting for. If you're feeling adventurous and want to try something with huge potential, Quen 3-235B-
4:07:42
A22B-2507 might surprise you. Just be prepared for some inconsistency. And if you need
4:07:48
something basic that just works, Gro 4 will do the job. But here's the real secret. The best coders don't rely on
4:07:55
just one AI. They use multiple models for different tasks. Use Gemini for rapid prototyping and visual
4:08:01
applications. Use Claude for production code that needs to be professional. Use Quen 3-235B-
4:08:07
A22B-2507 when you want to experiment with cutting edge capabilities. This is exactly the
4:08:13
kind of strategy we teach inside the AI profit boardroom. We have over 1,000 members who are scaling their businesses

Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below and let me know which AI you think performed the
4:08:32
best. Some AIs are better at content creation, others excel at technical analysis. Some are perfect for client
4:08:37
communication. The same principle applies to coding. Master multiple tools and you'll outperform someone using just
4:08:44
one AI, no matter how powerful that single AI is. If you want to learn more about building systems like this in your

4:08:56
we use AI to scale our agency and how you can do the same. Here's the bottom line from this coding battle. Each AI
4:09:03
has strengths and weaknesses. Gemini impressed with speed and visual results. Claude delivered professional quality.
4:09:10
Quen 3-235B- A22B-2507 showed innovative potential. Groke
4:09:16
provided reliable basics. But the real winner is anyone who learns to use all these tools strategically. That's what
4:09:23
we're teaching inside the AI success lab. real strategies, real results, real community of people who are building

4:09:39
you think won this coding challenge. And I'll see you in the next video. Today, I'm going to show you which AI model
4:09:46
actually wins when it comes to real business tasks. I just ran the most comprehensive AI test ever. Five brutal
4:09:53
business challenges, three top AI models. The results will shock you. One, AI completely failed a basic task.
4:09:59
Another dominated content creation, and the third one surprised everyone with its speed. This could save you thousands
4:10:05
of dollars and hours of wasted time. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of
4:10:11
SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the
4:10:18
latest AI updates. You know what drives me crazy? Everyone's talking about which AI is best, but nobody's actually
4:10:24
testing them on real business tasks. Everyone just asks them to write a poem
4:10:29
or solve a math problem that's useless. So, I decided to do something different. I created five brutal business tests,
4:10:36
real tasks that you and I face every single day. SEO analysis, content creation, strategic planning, the works.
4:10:43
And I put three of the hottest AI models through the ringer. Gro 4, Claude 4 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. What I found
4:10:51
will change how you think about AI forever. Let me break this down for you. First, let me tell you about the testing
4:10:57
method because this wasn't some casual comparison. This was scientific. This was real. I created five different
4:11:04
business scenarios. Each one designed to test a different skill that matters in business. Researchability, content
4:11:10
creation, strategic thinking, technical knowledge, speed. Every test had clear evaluation criteria. I measured speed. I
4:11:18
measured accuracy. I measured quality. And I scored everything on a point system. So there was no bias. And I'm
4:11:24
going to share the exact prompts I used. So you can test these yourself. You can see if you get the same results. You can
4:11:30
use these prompts in your own business. Test one was SEO competitive analysis. This is something I do every single day
4:11:36
in my agency. I gave each AI model a scenario where they're running a project management software company. They had to
4:11:43
analyze competitors like Asana and Monday.com, find keyword opportunities, identify content gaps, create a
4:11:50
six-month strategy. Here's the exact prompt I used. I run a midsize SAS company selling project management
4:11:56
software. Our main competitors are Asana, Monday.com, and Trello. Create a
4:12:01
comprehensive SEO competitive analysis that includes one, identify 10 highv value keyword opportunities where we
4:12:08
could outrank these competitors. Two, analyze their content gaps we could exploit. Three, recommend a six-month
4:12:15
SEO strategy with specific tactics and expected timeline for results. Include reasoning for your recommendations.
4:12:22
This is complex stuff. This requires research skills, strategic thinking,
4:12:27
business understanding, and here's what happened. Grock 4 absolutely crushed this test. It delivered the most
4:12:33
comprehensive report I've ever seen from an AI. Detailed tables, extensive data analysis, strategic insights that
4:12:40
actually made sense. The organization was perfect. The visual presentation was clean. Claude the fourth Sonic came in
4:12:46
second. Strong analytical depth, good strategic recommendations, well structured, but just not as
4:12:53
comprehensive as Grock. Gemini 2.5 Pro. It was the fastest by far. But the analysis was basic surface level and not
4:12:59
enough depth for real strategic decision- making. So after test one, Grock was leading. Test two was content
4:13:06
creation. I asked each AI to write a complete 1,500word blog post for cyber
4:13:12
security company. Target keyword was endpoint security best practices 2025
4:13:17
had to include SEO optimization, proper heading structure, actionable advice,
4:13:23
internal linking opportunities, a compelling call to action. Here's the exact prompt. Write a complete 1,500word
4:13:31
blog post for our B2B cyber security company targeting IT directors at midsize companies with 500 to 2,000
4:13:39
employees. Primary keyword endpoint security best practices 2025 include one
4:13:46
SEO optimized title and meta description. Two proper heading structure H1 to H3 five actionable best
4:13:54
practices with real world examples. Four internal linking opportunities suggest three five a compelling CTA for our
4:14:01
endpoint security audit. Make it authoritative but accessible avoiding technical jargon. This is breadandbut
4:14:07
content marketing something every business needs. and Claude Force on it destroyed this test. It delivered 1,620
4:14:13
words of absolutely beautiful content. The SEO optimization was perfect.
4:14:18
Natural keyword integration. The structure was clean. The readability was incredible. It felt like a human expert
4:14:24
wrote it. Gemini 2.5 Pro came in second with 1529 words. Good content quality,
4:14:31
proper SEO elements, solid performance across the board. But here's where things got interesting. Gro 4 had a
4:14:38
massive problem. It claimed it wrote 1,512 words, but when I counted only 1,221
4:14:45
words. That's a huge accuracy issue. You can't trust an AI that lies about word count. What else is it lying about? So,
4:14:52
after test two, Claude was catching up. Test three was content repurposing. I I gave them a high performing blog post
4:14:59
about remote team management. 3,000 words that generated 15,000 organic
4:15:04
views and 200 leads. Real numbers from real campaigns. I asked them to turn
4:15:10
this into eight different content formats. LinkedIn carousel, email newsletter series, Twitter thread,
4:15:16
YouTube script, infographic outline, podcast brief, Instagram stories, short
4:15:21
form video script. Here's the exact prompt. We have a high-erforming 30,000word blog post about remote team
4:15:27
management strategies that generated 15,000 organic views and 200 leads. Transform this single piece into eight
4:15:33
different content formats for maximum reach. One, LinkedIn carousel post. Two,
4:15:38
email newsletter series. Three-part. Three, Twitter thread. Four, YouTube video script 8 to 10 minutes. Five,
4:15:46
infographic outline. Six, podcast episode brief. Seven, Instagram story series. Eight. Short form video script
4:15:52
60 seconds. Provide the actual content scripts, not just ideas. This tests
4:15:58
creativity adaptation skills. Platform understanding. Clawed for Sonic won again. And it wasn't even close. The
4:16:04
copyrightiting was exceptional. The hooks were incredible. Each piece of content was perfectly optimized for its platform. The quality stayed high across
4:16:11
all eight formats. Gemini 2.5 Pro came second. Good adaptation skills, solid
4:16:17
content, but missing that creative spark. Grock 4 was adequate, functional, but boring. No compelling hooks, no
4:16:24
engagement. Claude was pulling ahead. Test four was editorial calendar development. Create a 90-day content
4:16:30
calendar for a project management tool. Target keywords around project management tips and team productivity.
4:16:35
Include content clusters, seasonal topics, lead magnets, promotion strategy. Here's the exact prompt I
4:16:42
used. Create a 90-day content calendar for our SAS project management tool targeting small business owners and team
4:16:48
leaders. We want to rank for project management tips, team productivity, and
4:16:54
small business efficiency. Include one, 24 blog post topics with target keywords
4:16:59
and search intent. Two, content cluster strategy linking related posts. Three,
4:17:05
seasonal trending topic integration. Four, lead magnet content three pieces.
4:17:10
Five, content promotion strategy for each post format as a detailed calendar with publication dates, word counts, and
4:17:17
success metrics. This is strategic planning at its finest. And here's where
4:17:22
things got interesting. Both Gro 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro tied for first place,
4:17:27
both delivered excellent table-based organization, comprehensive planning, detailed timelines and metrics,
4:17:33
strategic thinking, visual clarity that made the plans immediately actionable. Claude the fourth sonic came third. good
4:17:39
analysis and recommendations, comprehensive, but it lacked the superior organization of the other two.
4:17:45
So, we had a three-way race going into the final test. Test five was technical SEO audit. I gave them a 500page
4:17:52
e-commerce website with multiple technical issues, duplicate title tags, slow site speed, broken links, missing
4:17:59
structured data, missing alt text, outdated XML sitemap, limited
4:18:05
development resources, only 20 hours per month. Here's the exact prompt. I'm the CMO of a 500page e-commerce website. Our
4:18:13
developer found these technical issues. One, 127 pages with duplicate title
4:18:18
tags. Two, site speed averaging 4.2 seconds on mobile. Three, 23 broken
4:18:24
internal links. Four, missing structured data on product pages. Five, 15% of
4:18:29
images missing alt text. Six, XML sitemap hasn't been updated in 8 months.
4:18:34
We have limited development resources. 20 hours per month, create a priority matrix ranking these issues by SEO
4:18:41
impact versus implementation effort and provide a three-month implementation road map. They had to create a priority
4:18:48
matrix, rank issues by SEO impact versus implementation effort. Provide a
4:18:54
three-month road map. Both Grock 4 and Claude for Sonnet tied for first. Excellent strategic road maps, strong
4:19:00
prioritization logic, clear implementation paths, deep technical SEO understanding, practical resource
4:19:06
allocation. Gemini 2.5 Pro came third. Adequate technical understanding, but
4:19:11
missing the strategic depth and implementation detail. But wait, I wasn't done testing yet. I wanted to see
4:19:17
how these AIs handled something completely different, game development. Because if you can build games, you can
4:19:22
build anything. So, I threw two more brutal tests at them. Test six was building a Minecraft inspired 3D world
4:19:28
generator using p5.gs. This is hardcore coding, real programming skills. Here's the exact
4:19:34
prompt. Build a Minecraft inspired 3D world generator using p5gs. Create one,
4:19:40
a 20x20 grid of procedurally generated terrain with different block types, grass, stone, dirt, water. Two,
4:19:48
firsterson camera controls. Where's the movement mouse look? Three, block placement removal system, left right
4:19:55
click. Four, at least four different block textures. Five, simple lighting or shading effects. Six, inventory system
4:20:02
showing available blocks. Seven, save, load, world state functionality. Focus
4:20:07
on performance. It should run smoothly at 30 plus frames per second. Include chunkbased loading for scalability.
4:20:14
This is insanely complex. 3D graphics, game mechanics, performance optimization, user interface, data
4:20:21
persistence. Clawed force on it won this round. It actually created a game not fully playable, but it built something
4:20:28
that resembled what I asked for. The code structure was solid. The approach was logical. Gro 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
4:20:35
They finished fast, but the code was full of errors, broken functionality, incomplete features, speed without
4:20:42
substance. Then I hit them with test seven, a 2D endless runner game. Here's the prompt. Create a complete 2D endless
4:20:48
runner game using HTML 5 canvas and JavaScript. The game should include one, a character that can jump to avoid
4:20:55
obstacles. Two, randomly generated obstacles moving from right to left. Three, score system that increases over
4:21:01
time. Four, game over screen with restart functionality. Five, progressive difficulty. Obstacles get faster. Six,
4:21:09
simple particle effects when jumping or colliding. make it fully playable with smooth animations and responsive
4:21:15
controls. Include proper game state management and clean commented code.
4:21:20
Clawed force on it absolutely destroyed this test. It created a completely playable game. Smooth animations,
4:21:26
responsive controls, progressive difficulty, particle effects, game state management, everything worked perfectly.
4:21:34
The game was actually hard but so fun to play like a real indie game you'd find on Steam. Grock 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
4:21:41
Same story, fast responses, broken code, lots of errors, incomplete functionality. This revealed something
4:21:48
huge about these AIs. So, what were the final results after all seven tests?
4:21:53
Claude for Sonic won four solo victories and one co-win. Six out of seven strong performances. Absolutely dominant. Grock
4:22:00
4 won one solo victory and two co-wins. Three out of seven strong performances. Gemini 2.5 Pro won zero solo victories
4:22:07
and one co-ind. One out of seven strong performances. But here's what really matters. The insights. Claude for Sonnet
4:22:13
isn't just good at content creation. It's exceptional at complex coding tasks. Game development, interactive
4:22:19
applications, advanced programming challenges. When you need something that actually works, Claude delivers. Gro 4
4:22:26
and Gemini 2.5 Pro are fast. But fast doesn't matter if the code is broken, if
4:22:32
the functionality doesn't work, if you can't actually use what they create. This is the difference between an AI
4:22:38
that can help you build a real business versus an AI that just gives you pretty responses that don't work. Claude Forson
4:22:45
is the king of content creation, blog posts, copywriting, content repurposing. If you're doing content marketing, this
4:22:51
is your AI. The quality is consistently excellent. The engagement is superior. The readability is perfect. But that's not all. Claude also dominates complex
4:22:58
coding tasks, game development, interactive applications, advanced programming. When you need code that
4:23:04
actually works, Claude is your AI. Grock 4 is the analysis beast. Competitive research, strategic planning,
4:23:10
comprehensive reporting. If you need deep analysis, and strategic thinking, this is your AI. The organization is
4:23:16
excellent. The visual presentation is clean. Gemini 2.5 Pro is the speed
4:23:21
demon. Fastest response times by far. Good content quality for basic tasks. Reliable performance for simple
4:23:27
requests. If you need quick turnaround, and speed is more important than quality or functionality, this is your AI. But
4:23:34
here's the thing that nobody talks about. Different A is for different tasks. You don't need to pick just one.
4:23:40
In my agency, we use Claude for all our content creation, blog posts for clients, email campaigns, social media
4:23:47
content. It's unmatched. We use Grock for competitive analysis, market
4:23:52
research, strategic planning. When we need comprehensive reports for clients, we use Gemini when we need quick
4:23:58
answers, fast research, rapid content for social media, time-sensitive projects. It's like having different
4:24:04
tools in a toolbox. You don't use a hammer for everything. But if I had to pick just one AI for business, claude
4:24:10
force on it. Here's why. Content is everything in business today. Content marketing drives leads. Copywriting
4:24:16
drives sales. Email campaigns drive revenue. Social media content builds brands. And Claude dominates content
4:24:22
creation. But here's what shocked me the most. Claude also dominates coding, real development work, functional
4:24:28
applications, interactive tools. This means Claude can help you build the entire business ecosystem. Content to
4:24:34
attract customers, code to serve customers, everything you need in one AI. Plus, Claude's consistency is
4:24:42
incredible. Every single test, it delivered highquality results. You can trust it. Grock's word count issue in
4:24:48
the blog post test is concerning. If it lies about something basic like word count, what else might it get wrong?
4:24:54
Speed is nice, but quality matters more. Would you rather have a fast AI that gives you mediocre content or a slightly
4:25:02
slower AI that gives you incredible content? I know which one I choose, but only if you use it correctly. Only if
4:25:08
you go beyond the surface level stuff. Only if you treat it like the powerful business tool it actually is. These test
4:25:15
results prove that AI can handle complex business tasks, real work, real value. The question is, are you ready to take
4:25:21
advantage of it? Are you ready to use AI to scale your business, get more customers, save hundreds of hours, or
4:25:27
are you going to keep using it to write poems? The choice is yours. But I know what successful entrepreneurs choose.
4:25:33
They choose results over entertainment, business value over party tricks, real applications over fun experiments.
4:25:40
That's what separates successful people from everyone else. They see the opportunity, they take action, they get
4:25:46
results. If you want to join them, if you want to scale your business with AI, I have three ways I can help you right
4:25:52

4:26:59
the next video. Today, I'm going to show you Google's
4:27:05
brand new AI coding agent that just dropped, and it's completely free. This thing can build entire apps from your
4:27:12
terminal. It can fix broken code. It can even create slide decks from your GitHub projects. And here's the crazy part. It
4:27:19
takes less than 2 minutes to set up. I'm going to walk you through exactly how to get this running. Plus, I'll show you
4:27:24
the one mistake everyone's making that breaks it instantly. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of
4:27:30
Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get
4:27:35
more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Let me be real with you. I've tested Claude
4:27:42
Code. I've tested all the other AI agents. But this one is different. Google just released something that
4:27:48
could put a lot of paid tools out of business. And most people don't even know it exists yet. So, if you want to
4:27:53
build apps without knowing how to code, stay tuned because by the end of this video, you'll have a free AI developer
4:27:59
working for you 24/7. Julian Goldie reads every comment. So, make sure you comment below and let me know what you
4:28:05
think about this new tool. All right, let's dive in. So, Google just dropped this thing called Gemini CLI, and it's
4:28:12
basically like having a coding expert sitting right next to you, except this expert never gets tired, never asks for
4:28:18
arrays, and works for free. Here's what makes this different from everything else out there. Most AI coding tools
4:28:24
just write code. This thing actually runs the code for you. It opens files. It launches apps in your browser. It can
4:28:30
even do Google searches while it's coding. And get this, it's open source, completely free. You get 1,000 model
4:28:36
requests per day. That's way more than most people will ever use. But here's where it gets interesting. This isn't
4:28:41
just for developers. I don't code. I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time. But I can now build apps with
4:28:47
this. And if I can do it, anyone can do it. Let me show you exactly how to set this up. And I'll show you some real
4:28:52
examples of what this thing can build. First, you need NodeJS version 18 or
4:28:57
higher. Don't worry, it's free and takes 2 seconds to install. I'll put the link in the comments. Then you open your
4:29:03
terminal. If you're on Mac, just search for terminal. If you're on Windows, search for command prompt. Now, here's
4:29:09
the magic command. You type mpm install g Google generative AI cl. Hit enter and
4:29:15
boom, it starts installing. The setup is ridiculously easy. It asks you to pick a color theme. I went with the default.
4:29:22
Then it asks you to authenticate. You can use your API key if you have one, or
4:29:28
you can just loging in with Google. I clicked login with Google. It opens a browser window. You sign in and that's it. You're done. The whole setup took me
4:29:34
less than 2 minutes. Compare that to some other tools that take hours to configure. Now, here's where it gets fun. You can start giving it commands
4:29:41
immediately. I typed, "Are you working?" And it replied, "Yes, how can I help?"
4:29:46
That's when I knew this thing was legit. So, let's test it out with something real. I said, "Write a new Discord bot
4:29:51
that answers questions using the FAQ file." And it started coding right in front of me, building the entire bot
4:29:57
from scratch. But here's what blew my mind. It doesn't just write the code and leave you hanging. It explains what it's
4:30:03
doing. It asks if you want to run the code and it can even launch the finished product in your browser. Let me give you
4:30:09
another example. I asked it to create a slide deck based on a GitHub project. Now, normally this would take hours of work. You'd have to analyze the code,
4:30:15
write the content, design the slides, format everything. This thing did it in minutes. It went to the GitHub repo,
4:30:22
analyzed all the code, created a markdown file with the slide content, then converted it to HTML, and launched
4:30:28
it in my browser. Was the design perfect? No. But did it work? Absolutely. And here's the best part.
4:30:34
When I didn't like the design, I just said, "Make the UI more beautiful." And
4:30:40
it redesigned the whole thing, added better colors, improved the layout, made it look professional. I felt like I had
4:30:46
a personal developer working for me. But wait, there's more. This thing can do way more than just coding. You can say
4:30:52
things like, I give me a summary of all the changes that went in yesterday and it'll analyze your entire project and
4:30:57
give you a report or help me migrate this codebase and it'll walk you through
4:31:02
the entire migration process or make a full screen web app for a wall display to show our most important issues. The
4:31:09
possibilities are endless. Now, I want to show you something really cool. I asked it to build an SEO calculator just
4:31:16
to see what would happen. I said code out an SEO calculator. Make sure the UI is as engaging as possible. And boom, it
4:31:23
started building, created the HTML, added the CSSE styling, built the JavaScript functionality, and launched
4:31:29
it in my browser. The whole thing took maybe 5 minutes, and I now have a working SEO calculator that I can use
4:31:34
for my clients. Think about this for a second. I just saved hours of development work, and I didn't pay a
4:31:39
single dollar for it. This is why I think this tool could put a lot of paid alternatives out of business. Now, let me be honest with you. It's not perfect.
4:31:46
I ran into some bugs during my testing. Sometimes it switches from the smart model to the faster model when there's
4:31:51
high demand. And the faster model isn't as good. When that happens, the outputs get worse, the code isn't as clean, and
4:31:59
sometimes it just breaks completely. But here's the fix. If it breaks, just close the terminal, run the installation
4:32:05
command again, and start fresh. Takes 30 seconds. The other thing is speed. Sometimes it's fast, sometimes it's
4:32:11
slow. Depends on how many people are using it. But even with these issues, this thing is incredible for a free
4:32:18
tool. Now, let me compare this to some other options out there. Claude Code has been trending like crazy and it's good,
4:32:25
but you have to pay for it after the free tier and the setup is more complicated. GitHub Copilot is also
4:32:31
solid, but again, you're paying monthly and it just writes code. It doesn't run it for you. Cursor is another popular
4:32:38
option, but same story, paid limited features in the free version. This
4:32:43
Google tool gives you most of the same functionality for free with unlimited use up to a thousand requests per day.
4:32:49
That's a gamecher. Now, here's something interesting. You can actually use this with your existing projects, not just
4:32:55
new ones. Say you have a website that's been sitting around for months. You can navigate to that folder in your
4:33:00
terminal. Then ask Gemini CLI to analyze it, improve it, add new features, fix
4:33:05
bugs. It can read all your files, understand your code structure, and make intelligent suggestions. I tested this
4:33:12
with an old project of mine. Asked it to add mobile responsiveness to a website that was only desktop friendly. It went
4:33:17
through every file, updated the CSS, added media queries, and made the whole site mobile friendly. That would have
4:33:24
taken me days to figure out. It did it in an hour. This is the power of having an AI that can actually interact with
4:33:30
your file system. It's not just giving you code snippets. It's working on your actual project. And here's another cool
4:33:36
feature. You can ask it to organize your files, convert file formats, even analyze your spending from PDF invoices.
4:33:43
Someone in the comments asked if it can fix broken video files. I don't know, but given what I've seen, I wouldn't be
4:33:49
surprised. The key is that this isn't just a coding tool. It's a general purpose AI assistant that happens to be
4:33:54
really good at coding. Now, let me give you some tips for getting the most out of this. First, be specific with your
4:34:01
requests. Don't just say build an app. say, "Build a to-do app with dark mode
4:34:06
and the ability to set due dates." The more specific you are, the better the output. Second, don't be afraid to
4:34:13
iterate. If you don't like something, just ask it to change it. Make it more colorful. Add animation. Make it look
4:34:20
more professional. It's designed to work with you, not just dump code and disappear. Third, save your work. When
4:34:26
it builds something you like, make sure you know where the files are saved. Usually, it's in your current directory.
4:34:32
And fourth, if it breaks, don't panic. Just restart and try again. These tools are still new. Bugs happen, but when
4:34:38
they work, they're magic. Now, I want to talk about the bigger picture here, because this isn't just about free coding tools. This is about what's
4:34:44
happening in the AI space right now. Google is making a serious play to compete with OpenAI and Anthropic.
4:34:50
They're giving away powerful tools for free, building up user loyalty, getting people used to their ecosystem, and
4:34:57
frankly, it's working. This Gemini CLI tool is better than some paid alternatives I've used. If you're a
4:35:02
business owner, this should get your attention because AI automation is happening whether you're ready or not.
4:35:08
The companies that figure this out first are going to have a massive advantage. They'll be able to build faster, iterate
4:35:13
quicker, and do it all for less money. The companies that ignore this, they're going to get left behind. This is why I
4:35:19
spend so much time testing these new tools, not because I love technology, but because I want to find the ones that
4:35:25
actually move the needle for businesses. And this Gemini CLI, this moves the needle. Think about all the small tasks
4:35:31
you pay developers for. Quick fixes, simple apps, data processing scripts. You could potentially do all of that
4:35:37
yourself now for free. Or if you have developers on your team, they just became way more productive. They can
4:35:42
focus on the complex stuff while the AI handles the routine work. Either way, you win. Now, let me address something
4:35:48
I'm sure some of you are thinking. Julian, this sounds too good to be true. What's the catch? The catch is that it's
4:35:54
new. There are bugs. Sometimes it's slow. and Google could change the terms at any time, but right now today is free
4:36:00
and it works, so why not take advantage of it? The worst thing that happens is you learn something new. The best thing
4:36:05
that happens is you build something that makes you money. I'd take those odds any day. Let me tell you about someone I
4:36:10
know who's already using AI coding tools to build a business. He's not a developer, never learned to code, but
4:36:16
he's using tools like this to build simple web apps for local businesses, invoice generators, appointment
4:36:22
schedulers, simple e-commerce sites, nothing complicated, but stuff that local businesses actually need. He
4:36:29
charges $500 to $2,000 per project, and he can build most of them in a day or two with AI help. Do the math on that.
4:36:36
Even if he only does two projects per month, that's $2,000 to $8,000 in extra income. Not bad for someone who doesn't
4:36:42
know how to code. This is the opportunity in front of you right now. The barrier to entry for building
4:36:48
software has never been lower. You don't need a computer science degree. You don't need years of experience. You just
4:36:53
need to be willing to experiment and learn. And tools like this Gemini CLI make it easier than ever. Now, I want to
4:37:00
show you one more example before we wrap up because this one really shows the power of what we're dealing with. I
4:37:05
asked it to create a web app that displays GitHub issues on a wall monitor, like something you'd see in a
4:37:10
tech company's office. This is a pretty complex request. It needs to connect to
4:37:15
GitHub's API, pull live data, display it in a nice format, update automatically.
4:37:21
Normally, this would be a multi-day project for a developer. This thing built it in about 20 minutes. It created the HTML structure, added the CSS
4:37:28
styling, wrote the JavaScript to connect to GitHub, set up automatic updates, and made it full screen responsive. When I
4:37:34
opened it in my browser, I had a live dashboard showing all the issues from the project with real-time updates. It
4:37:40
looked like something a professional development team would build. That's when it really hit me. This isn't just a helpful tool. This is a fundamental
4:37:46
shift in how software gets built. We're moving from a world where you need technical expertise to build things to a
4:37:52
world where you just need good ideas and the ability to communicate with AI. That's huge. And it's happening right
4:37:57
now. Not in 5 years, not in 10 years, right now. The question is, are you going to take advantage of it? Or are
4:38:02
you going to let this opportunity pass you by? Because here's the thing, early adopters always win with new technology.
4:38:09
The people who jumped on social media first built the biggest followings. The people who started e-commerce stores first made the most money. And the
4:38:16
people who figure out AI automation first are going to dominate their industries. This Gemini CLI tool is just
4:38:22
one piece of that puzzle, but it's a pretty important piece. So, here's what I want you to do. Go install this tool.
4:38:28
Play around with it. Build something simple. See what it can do. Don't worry about being perfect. Don't worry about
4:38:33
building the next Facebook. Just experiment. Ask it to build a simple calculator or a basic website or a tool
4:38:40
that solves a problem you have. See how it works. Get a feel for what's possible. Because once you see what this
4:38:45
thing can do, you'll start seeing opportunities everywhere. Problems that need solving, tools that need building,
4:38:51
processes that need automating, and now you'll have the ability to actually do something about it. That's the real power here. Not just the tool itself,
4:38:58
but the mindset shift that comes with it. From I can't build that to let me see what I can build. That shift alone
4:39:04
is worth more than any paid course or certification. All right, let's wrap this up. We covered a lot today. We
4:39:10
talked about what Gemini CLI is, how to set it up, what it can build, how it compares to other tools, and why this
4:39:16
matters for your business. The bottom line is this. Google just gave you a free AI developer. Use it, build
4:39:22
something, break something, fix something, learn something. The companies and individuals who embrace AI
4:39:28
automation now are going to have a massive advantage in the coming years. Don't be the person who looks back and
4:39:34
wishes they had started sooner. If you want to dive deeper into AI automation

4:40:25
bigger. Thanks for watching. Julian Goldie reads every comment, so let me know what you build with this tool, and I'll see you in the next one. Google
4:40:32
just started a war with Anthropic. Two AI coding agents battling for your terminal. One cost $50 to $100 a day.
4:40:38
The other is completely free. I tested both and the results will shock you. Today, I'm showing you which one
4:40:44
actually wins and why this battle changes everything for developers. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the
4:40:50
digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's
4:40:57
helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Julian Goldie reads
4:41:04
every comment, so make sure you comment below. The AI coding wall just got real. Google dropped Gemini CLI yesterday, and
4:41:10
it's going head-to-head with Claude Code from Anthropic. Both tools do the same thing. They're AI agents that live in
4:41:16
your terminal. They write code. They run commands. They build entire projects. But here's the crazy part. One of them
4:41:22
costs up to $100 per day to use. The other one completely free. I've tested both. I've compared them on real
4:41:29
projects. And today I'm going to show you which one actually wins because choosing the wrong one could cost you
4:41:35
thousands of dollars or worse, it could cost you time. First, let's talk about
4:41:40
Google's weapon, Gemini CLI. This thing just launched yesterday. It's an AI
4:41:46
agent that runs directly in your terminal, not in a browser, not in an IDE. Right there in your command line is
4:41:51
powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro. That's Google's best AI model. The one that beats chat GPT in most coding
4:41:57
benchmarks. And Google gave it serious firepower. 1 million token context window. That means it can remember
4:42:03
entire code bases. Every file, every function, every variable. But here's where Google is playing dirty. They made
4:42:08
it completely free. 60 requests per minute, 1,000 requests per day, no
4:42:14
credit card required, no trial that expires, and it's open- source Apache 2.0 license. That means you can modify
4:42:22
it. You can see exactly how it works. You can trust it. It connects to Google search for real-time information. It
4:42:27
supports MCP for connecting to other tools. It can generate images with Imagin, videos with VO, even music with
4:42:33
LIA. This isn't just a coding tool. It's like having Google's entire AI arsenal in your terminal. Now, let's talk about
4:42:40
anthropics challenger. Claude Code. Claude Code launched earlier this year. It's also a terminal based AI agent
4:42:47
built on Claude 3.7 Sonnet. And Claude 3.7 is no joke. It's one of the best coding models in the world. Some people
4:42:54
say it's better than GPT4 for complex programming tasks. Claude code can handle massive projects. We're talking
4:43:00
about tasks that would take a human 45 minutes or more. It can refactor entire code bases. It can write comprehensive
4:43:05
test suites. It can manage complex Git workflows. It's designed for serious developers, people who are building real
4:43:12
products, not just experimenting. But here's the catch. It's expensive. Really expensive. Users report spending $50 to
4:43:19
$100 per day. That's fun from $500 to $36 $600 per month just for an AI coding
4:43:24
tool. And it's closed source. You can't see how it works. You can't modify it. You have to trust Anthropic completely.
4:43:31
All right, let's compare these two directly because this is where it gets interesting. Round one cost Gemini CLI
4:43:37
wins this by a landslide. It's free. Claude Code can cost you $50 to $100 per day. That's $18,000 to $36,000 per year
4:43:45
versus $0 per year. No contest. But wait, what if free means worse quality?
4:43:50
Let's keep going. Round two. Performance. This is where it gets tricky. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is really good
4:43:56
at coding. It has this deep reasoning ability that's hard to beat. But Gemini 2.5 Pro is no slouch either. Google's
4:44:03
latest tests show it beating GPT4 on most coding benchmarks. Based on
4:44:08
developer reports, Claude Code is better at complex refactoring tasks. It understands code architecture better. It
4:44:14
makes fewer mistakes on large projects. But Gemini CLI is faster. It gives you answers quicker and for most tasks, the
4:44:21
quality is just as good. I'm calling this one a tie. Both are really good at what they do. Round three. Context
4:44:28
window. Gemini CLI has 1 million tokens. Clawed Code has less than that. This matters for big projects. The more
4:44:35
context the AI can see, the better it suggestions. Gemini CLI wins this round.
4:44:41
Round four features. Claude Code is focused. It does one thing really well.
4:44:46
terminal based coding. Gemini CLI is a Swiss Army knife. It codes, it does research with Google search. It
4:44:52
generates images and videos. It connects to databases through MCP. If you want a specialized tool, Claude Code might be
4:44:59
better. If you want an all-in-one solution, Gemini CLI wins. Gemini CLI
4:45:04
takes this round. Round five, reliability. Clawed Code has been around
4:45:09
longer. It's more stable. The bugs have been worked out. Gemini CLI just launched, is still in preview. You might
4:45:14
hit some issues. But here's the thing. Because Gemini CLI is open- source, bugs get fixed fast. The community is already
4:45:22
contributing improvements. Clawed Code wins this round, but it's close. Round six, trust and transparency. Gemini CLI
4:45:29
is open source. You can inspect every line of code. You know exactly what it's doing with your data. Claude code is a
4:45:34
black box. You have to trust anthropic completely. For businesses handling sensitive code, this is huge. Gemini CLI
4:45:41
wins. If you want to do your own comparison between these tools, here's how. One, same project test, build the
4:45:49
exact same app with both tools, maybe a simple to-do app or calculator, compare, code quality, time taken, how many
4:45:56
iterations needed, and final result. Two, debugging challenge. Give both
4:46:01
tools the same buggy code, see which one finds the bug faster, explains it better, and provides the better fix.
4:46:07
Three, learning test. Ask both to teach you a new framework like Nex.js JS or React compare quality of explanations
4:46:15
code examples provided and how upto-date their knowledge is four cost analysis track how much you spend over a week

you do this comparison drop your results thoughts in the comments. I'd love to see what you find. So, which one is
4:46:45
better? Here's my honest take. If money is no object and you're working on complex professional projects, Claude
4:46:52
Code might have an edge based on developer reports. It's more sophisticated for complex tasks. But for
4:46:58
99% of developers, Gemini CLI is the better choice. Here's why. Based on my
4:47:03
actual testing and research, first, it's free. that $1,500 to $3,600 per month
4:47:08
you save with Gemini CLI. You can hire a junior developer with that money. Second, it's more versatile. It doesn't
4:47:15
just code. It researches. It generates content. It connects to other tools. Third, it's transparent. You can see how
4:47:21
it works. You can modify it. You can trust it with sensitive projects. Fourth, it's backed by Google. It's not
4:47:27
going anywhere. It's going to get better fast. Claude Code is like a Ferrari. It's amazing, but it's expensive, and
4:47:33
you can only use it for one thing. Gemini CLI is like a Tesla. It's almost
4:47:38
as good, much cheaper, and it can do way more things. Here's my recommendation
4:47:44
for different types of users. If you're a beginner developer, use Gemini CLI.
4:47:49
It's free. It's easier to get started, and it can teach you while you code. If you're a freelancer or small business,
4:47:56
use Gemini CLI. You can't justify spending $3,000 per month on a coding tool. The free version does everything
4:48:03
you need. If you're working at a big company with a huge budget, consider Claude Code. If you're building
4:48:08
missionritical software and cost isn't an issue, the extra sophistication might be worth $50 per day. If you're working
4:48:15
on side projects, use Gemini CLI. No question. If you're learning AI and want
4:48:20
to experiment, use Gemini CLI. It's open source. You can hack on it. You can learn from it. Let's talk about what
4:48:26
this means for businesses because this isn't just about coding tools. Google just made enterprise level AI accessible
4:48:31
to everyone for free. That levels the playing field. A solo developer with Gemini CLI can now compete with teams
4:48:37
using expensive tools. Small businesses can build custom software without hiring big development teams. Startups can
4:48:43
prototype faster and cheaper. This is going to accelerate innovation and it's going to hurt companies that charge
4:48:48
premium prices for AI tools. Anthropic is in trouble. How do you compete with free? Especially when free is almost as
4:48:55
good as your $50, $100 per day premium product. Here's what I think happens next. Anthropic will probably drop their
4:49:01
prices. They have to. They can't charge $100 a day when Google gives similar functionality away. Other AI coding
4:49:08
tools will follow suit. GitHub, Copilot, Cursor, all of them will have to get
4:49:13
cheaper or get better. Google will keep improving Gemini CLI. They'll add more features. They'll make it faster.
4:49:20
They'll integrate it with more Google services and the developer community will go crazy with it because it's open
4:49:26
source. People will build amazing extensions and integrations. This is the beginning of the commoditization of AI
4:49:33
coding tools and that's great news for developers. Let me address some concerns I've heard. Free means it's not as good.
4:49:39
Not true. Google isn't making money from Gemini CLI directly. They're making money from getting you into their
4:49:46
ecosystem. So, they have every incentive to make it amazing. It's too new. It must be buggy. Yes,
4:49:53
it's new, but it's backed by Google. And because it's open source, bugs get fixed fast. I don't trust Google with my code.
4:50:00
Fair concern. But remember, this runs locally. Your code doesn't leave your machine unless you tell it to. Claude is
4:50:06
more sophisticated. True for some tasks, but for most developers, Gemini CLI is
4:50:12
sophisticated enough, and it's getting better every day. If you want to try Gemini CLI, it's super easy. You need no
4:50:19
GS installed. You need a Google account. That's it. Run one command. Sign in with Google. Start coding. I'll put the
4:50:25
installation instructions in the description. If you want to try Claude Code, you'll need to sign up for their beta. And you'll need a credit card
4:50:32
because it's going to cost you. Look, this isn't really about two coding tools. This is about the future of AI.
4:50:38
Google just showed that you can give away enterprise level AI for free and still make money. That changes
4:50:44
everything. It means AI is going to get cheaper and more accessible fast. It means small businesses and individual
4:50:50
developers are going to have access to tools that used to cost thousands of dollars. It means the barrier to entry for building AI powered applications
4:50:57
just got a lot lower. If you're a developer, this is amazing news. If you're a company selling expensive AI
4:51:02
tools, this is terrifying news. Either way, you need to pay attention because this is just the beginning. All right,
4:51:08
so here's what I want you to do first. If you want to scale your business and save hundreds of hours with AI
4:51:14
automation, check out my AI profit boardroom. It's the best place to get more customers and streamline your
4:51:19
operations with cuttingedge AI tools. Link is in the comments and description. Second, if you want a free SEO strategy
4:51:26
session to see how we can get you more leads and customers, book a call with my team. Link is in the comments and
4:51:31
description. Third, we have a complete SOP and process for using tools like Gemini CLI inside the AI success lab.
4:51:39
You'll get step-by-step tutorials, over a 100 use cases, and access to our community of 12,000 members who are
4:51:45
already using AI to transform their businesses. You can get all the video notes from this tutorial there, too.
4:51:51
Links are in the comments and description. Remember, Julian Goldie reads every single comment, so drop a
4:51:57
comment below and let me know which tool you're going to try first. Are you Team Gemini CLI or Team Claude Code? And what
4:52:04
are you going to build with whichever one you choose? I want to hear about it. And if you build something cool, I might
4:52:10
feature it in a future video. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one. So, we have the new update that's
4:52:17
just come out from Gemini CLI. So, if you're not familiar with what this is,
4:52:22
very similar to Plug Code and that sort of thing, you basically code from your terminal using Gemini CLI. It's an open-
4:52:28
source project and basically gives you like an AI coding agent directly on your
4:52:34
laptop. we're going to be testing out today, seeing how it performs, seeing how it goes, etc. And it's going to be
4:52:39
very interesting to test this out and just give it a cheeky. So, what we're going to do is we're going to have a look first of all what this is, how it
4:52:46
works, etc., how to set it up, and then we can just run a few tests on it, a few basic tests. So, you can basically get a
4:52:54
AI Studio account, which is free. And then you can see here you get 1,000
4:52:59
model requests per day, 60 requests per minute, is open source and is free of
4:53:05
charge before anyone says it's not free inside the comments. It is free and you can see it right here. And basically it
4:53:11
runs in the command line. So you can basically open up with terminal I believe and then you can even like do
4:53:17
Google searches and that sort of thing which is pretty cool. So you can see a little demo of how it works here. What's
4:53:24
interesting is I think you can actually connect it to immigen and also Veo3
4:53:29
from the demo which is really cool and I know claw code has been trending like
4:53:35
crazy recently so it's going to be interesting to see how this performs versus this as well and you can also use it with Gemini code assist as well
4:53:42
inside Visual Studio Code. Here's an example of what it looks like. So to get
4:53:48
started you can just install Gemini CLI. All you need is an email address to get Gemini.
4:53:55
And then the way that you can use it is through GitHub. All right. By the way, if you want like all this stuff, I'll
4:54:01
put the links as we go along inside the AI success lab. So, let's do that. Get
4:54:07
this bad boy set up. So, link in the comments description to the AI success lab and we can start getting this set
4:54:15
up. So, let's see. Tips for getting started blah blah blah. And Joe says, "Is this a real Julian?" It is indeed in
4:54:22
the flesh. Unlike my recent videos on YouTube, so it's a rare appearance from
4:54:28
me. My AI avatar seems to be outperforming me on YouTube, which is scary and crazy at the same time. And
4:54:36
too dirty says, "Did they release an AI agent that's open source for free?" Yeah. So, you can see on GitHub, this is
4:54:43
Gemini CLI, very similar to code as well to claw code. And you can also use MCP.
4:54:50
servers as well, which is interesting. I haven't tested that out yet either, but it's going to be Yeah, there's a lot of
4:54:55
cool stuff right here. So, let's have a look. So, we need Node.js version 18 or
4:55:00
higher. I'll put that inside the links as well. And then what else do we need?
4:55:08
I think we're good to go on that. I think I've got NodeJS already. So, now we just need to copy this command. So,
4:55:13
I'm on a Mac. I'm just going to open up the terminal here. And then we should be able to paste this in. Let's see what
4:55:19
happens. T says, "I installed Gemini CLI thinking it was some sort of AI agent."
4:55:24
It is an AI agent. It's just more It's more like a coding agent. That's basically what it is. But it is an
4:55:29
agent. Yeah, for sure. So, we can select the theme here. We got Dracula default,
4:55:35
etc. So, it's it's incredibly easy to set up, isn't it? Absolutely ridiculous.
4:55:40
And then you can put in your API key for Gemini or you can use Vertex or you can just log in with Google. Let's log in
4:55:46
with Google. Let's log in right here. And that should be set up now. So it says Gemini code assist and the Gemini
4:55:52
CLI now authorized to access your account. The ease of just setting this up is beautiful, isn't it? It's
4:55:59
absolutely beautiful. So let's just check. Are you working, mate? And it says yes. How can I help? So it's
4:56:06
working perfectly right there, which is great. Incredibly easy to install. Or you can use npm install as well. Pick a
4:56:12
color theme authenticated. Boom. Honey Fungus says it can do anything. has
4:56:18
access to your file system. So you can do more than write code, they can build
4:56:23
up a knowledge space, etc. Yeah, I think that's it, isn't it? You can do a lot more. I mean, you can see a couple of
4:56:30
examples right here, right? So you can say command new project, Gemini, write a new Discord bot that answers questions
4:56:37
using FAQ MD file that I will provide. What else we got here? Give me a summary of all the changes that went in
4:56:43
yesterday. And that's for the existing project, right? So what you can see here is this. It's essentially taking the
4:56:50
GitHub project then you command Gemini CLI Gemini and then get a summary. What
4:56:56
else we got here? Describe the main PC systems architecture. What security mechanisms are in place? Help me migrate
4:57:02
this codebase. This is interesting as well. Says make me a slide deck showing the git history
4:57:08
from the last seven days group by feature and team member. or make a full screen web app for a wall display to
4:57:15
show our most interactive issues. This interesting, isn't it? Let's see if we can work on a existing
4:57:22
project here. 230 says, "Can I use it to fix broken video files?" Interesting.
4:57:28
I don't know. This This only just came out a few hours ago, so it'd be interesting to test out yourself and
4:57:34
just see, okay, what can it do or how can it work, etc. So, let's see if we can actually make a slide deck here. I
4:57:41
don't know if that's going to work. I'm just going to allow always. In the
4:57:46
meantime, whilst that's doing that in the background, let's have a look what people are using it for on Twitter. See
4:57:53
what people are saying. It's always a fun game. So, write code, debug, and automate tasks. What else we got here?
4:58:01
See what people are doing. Lots of Japanese stuff. Coding. Oh, someone did a coding royale battle. Look at that.
4:58:08
claw code and non codeex open code amode and gemini and then just had six
4:58:14
different terminals running with the coders which is pretty crazy look at that so someone's testing like Gemini
4:58:21
versus codeex versus claw code as well there's me or the avatar version of me
4:58:28
there's me again all right let's I can't see anything that people built with this
4:58:34
generate a slide deck okay let's see what we can do generate a
4:58:39
slide deck based on the GitHub. And actually what we'll do is we'll paste in
4:58:45
that command that's a test run inside GitHub. Let's just grab that. Here we
4:58:50
go. Can I use it to create a Telegram bot that accepts payments? That's an interesting one as well. And then Honey
4:58:57
says that battle royale one with the six coders. The instruction was to terminate the other AI assistants. Crazy. It's got
4:59:04
the git history from the command that we ran earlier, right? So you can see basically what we've said is use this
4:59:10
GitHub. Then from there navigate to that blah blah blah and then from there like
4:59:15
start creating a slide deck. All right. So we should be able to we should be
4:59:22
able to create a slide deck from the GitHub. I've created the slide deck in slide deck MD. I wonder if can you open
4:59:30
up? So it's going to convert it into now I think. So basically what we've done is
4:59:35
we've taken that slide deck that we created coded it out using this free AI coder
4:59:43
and then converted it into HTML. And let's see if this works. So would you like me to open the file for you? I'm
4:59:48
going to put yes. And then it's going to run that command. Boom. There we go. And
4:59:54
that is the slide deck. I wouldn't say the UI is the best in the world if I'm honest with you. But did we just create
5:00:01
a slide deck from the GitHub, open the project, code out for free, etc.? Yeah,
5:00:06
that was really easy. And I say, can you make the UI
5:00:13
of this project more beautiful? W says everything you
5:00:18
imagine is possible. Yeah, that's true. Actually, you got to bear in mind like I don't even code. Like I have no idea
5:00:25
what I'm doing, but I can code now with this AI agent. So, if I can do it, anyone can do it pretty much. Let's see.
5:00:32
So, let's see if we can pre improve the UI of that presentation cuz that was pretty poor. All right. So, it's looking
5:00:39
slightly nicer. But now I'm going to say, okay, can you add some rainbow
5:00:46
colors and the dopamine inducing design to the HTML file? For
5:00:53
some reason, the first time I asked it to do this, it just redesigned the theme for itself.
5:00:58
So let's see what we get back now. And you can see it's using Gemini 2.5 Pro.
5:01:03
This is the API that's using to generate this. I think we get like maximum 60
5:01:09
commands per hour, which is like one per minute, which is probably about right. If you're creating something, I think
5:01:15
you're going to use more commands than that. I like the fact that you can take files locally. So you can like navigate
5:01:21
to a folder and then convert all the files in that directory to PNG, for example.
5:01:27
or organize my PDF invoices by month of expenditure. So, you can actually
5:01:32
interact directly with your system if that makes sense, like with your local laptop.
5:01:37
So, it struggled and now it switched from 2.5 Pro to Gemini 2.5 Flash. I'm
5:01:43
guessing everyone's just rinsing it right now. The only thing I wonder about this is I feel if you're just coding out
5:01:49
something like a HTML file, wouldn't you just use AI Studio? Like, why are you going to use this? Do you know what I
5:01:55
mean? especially if it's so slow. If I was coding the same thing inside AI
5:02:00
Studio, it's probably going to get done within 30 seconds, something like that.
5:02:05
Look at this. It's broken. If you press escape, you can stop it, I
5:02:11
think. So, let's Okay, switch back to Gemini 5 Pro. It's still trying to
5:02:20
generate stylesheets. It did not take long to break it. So, I
5:02:27
think that's probably the Let's have a look. All right, we're going to go back. Try to go back to main. What I'm
5:02:34
actually going to do is we'll request. If you press control and C, you can
5:02:40
cancel the request. All right, so you can see here request canceled. So,
5:02:45
code out a SEO calculator. Let's see if it can do that. Why is it gone back to
5:02:52
integrating stylesheets madness? I might have to close it down and then
5:02:57
start again, I think, at this point. All right, let's quit that. Let's try again,
5:03:02
my friends. So, it's good for you to see this cuz, okay, it's not perfect. It does have some bugs. Nobody shows you
5:03:10
this stuff on YouTube, but I'll show you. So, let's try again. All right, so
5:03:15
we should be good to go now. Let's see. See if we can just do basic tasks again.
5:03:23
Ah, it's totally crashed. It must be everyone is rinsing it. I think that's the problem. So, it switch back to
5:03:29
flash. Now, the problem is if you don't know this already, if you're using Flash, like it's just not as good as
5:03:36
Gemini 2.5 Pro, if that makes sense. But I'm going to say, okay, go ahead. But
5:03:41
make sure the UI is as dopamine inducing
5:03:46
as possible. So now it's working. So basically if you have any errors just shut it down, run the git clone command
5:03:54
again and then you can start coding again. It seems to work okay. I think the main thing is like the API for
5:04:00
Gemini 2.5 Pro is being rinsed and so it may switch over to flash instead which
5:04:06
means worse outputs but faster responses. And there we go. Let's see if this Oh,
5:04:12
there we go. So, we got the ROI calculator ready to go. Let's calculate the ROI. That's looking good. Coded out
5:04:19
perfectly. Launched it in the command. It wasn't that fast, but it did the job.
5:04:25
And that is also saved locally. Plus, it's running on a local host. So, pretty cool. Not bad at all. So, you now know
5:04:34
how to set up Gemini CLI, how it works, what to do if you have any problems, how
5:04:40
to make sure that it doesn't just code, but also runs that in your browser too, and how to do all of this for free. Now,
5:04:46
if you want the video notes from today, including like how to set up, etc., feel
5:04:52
free to get that inside the AI success lab link in the comments description. You can grab the notes and the links
5:04:57
right there. Additionally, inside here, we have loads of different stuff. You can see like we even have a 5h hour AI
5:05:04
agents course in there. It's pretty insane and loads of other stuff right here. Additionally,
5:05:10
inside the community, we're just giving away free stuff every single day. So, if you're not in there, you're missing out. Like, you can see all these different
5:05:15
free giveaways that we give away every single day. And additionally, you also get 100 different AI SEO tools,
5:05:23
plus all of this other stuff right here. So feel free to get that link in the comments in the description. If you
5:05:30
create any apps or anything like that inside the terminal with the code
5:05:36
assist, then all you do is you navigate to the directory. You've got all the files inside that
5:05:42
directory folder and you would just upload it to Netlifi or something like that and just get it hosted. That's the
5:05:48
easiest way to do it. Now, if you want to connect with me personally, feel free to connect with me inside the AI profit
5:05:55

5:07:11
Right? So if you're like okay I just want you to implement a NA10 process for me or set up some NA10 AI agents etc. We
5:07:20
can do that for you using the processes inside here link in the comments description. Appreciate you watching and
5:07:25
I'll see you on the next one. Cheers. B just dropped something crazy. A free AI agent that lives in your computer. It
5:07:32
codes for you, makes videos and thinks like a human. This changes everything for business owners. I'm going to show
5:07:38
you how to get it right now and why this might be the biggest AI breakthrough of 2025. Hey, if we haven't met already,
5:07:45
I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency, Goldie Agency, whilst
5:07:52
he's helping clients get more leads and customers. I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Julian Goldie reads
5:07:59
every comment, so make sure you comment below. Google just launched something that has me shook. They released Gemini
5:08:05
CLI agent and this thing is not like anything we've seen before. Most AI tools live in the browser. You go to a
5:08:11
website, you type stuff, you get answers. But this this lives on your computer in your terminal and it can do
5:08:17
things that will blow your mind. I'm talking about coding entire apps from scratch, making videos, writing content,
5:08:23
doing research that would take you hours and just minutes. And here's the crazy part. It's completely free. Gemini CLI
5:08:30
is an AI agent that runs directly on your computer, not in a browser, right there in your terminal. Think of it like
5:08:36
having a super smart assistant that can actually do stuff on your computer. Not just talk to you, but actually make
5:08:42
things happen. Google built this using their best AI model, Gemini 2.5 Pro.
5:08:47
This is the same model that beats Chat GPT in most coding tests, and they gave it a massive brain, 1 million tokens of
5:08:53
context. That's like reading 750 pages of text and remembering every single word. Most AI tools forget what you said
5:09:00
5 minutes ago. This thing remembers everything. But here's where it gets insane. They made it completely open
5:09:06
source. And the free limits, Google is playing dirty. You get 60 requests per minute. That's one request every second
5:09:11
for free. You get 1,000 requests per day. That's more than most people will ever use. Claude Code cost you $50 to
5:09:17
$100 per day. Open AI codeex is expensive, too. This completely free.
5:09:23
You open your terminal, you type one command, and boom, you have an AI agent that can see your files, read your code,
5:09:30
and make changes, but it doesn't just write code. This thing is way more powerful. You can ask it to build an
5:09:35
entire app from a sketch, just draw something on paper, take a photo, and it builds the app. You can ask it to make
5:09:41
videos using Google's VO model, professional quality videos from just a text description. You can ask it to do
5:09:47
deep research on any topic, and it uses Google search to get real-time information. You can ask it to manage
5:09:53
your projects, track your tasks, even handle your Git workflows. This is all happening locally on your computer. Your
5:10:00
code never leaves your machine. Your data stays private. This isn't just another AI chatbot. This is like having
5:10:06
a junior developer, researcher, and content creator all rolled into one. Google just declared war on every other
5:10:13
AI coding tool. Claude Code from Anthropic. Good luck competing with free. Open AI codeex. They charge you
5:10:19
for everything. Google gives it away. GitHub Copilot. This does way more than just code completion. Most AI coding
5:10:25
tools work in an IDE. They give you suggestions. They help you write code, but they're limited. Gemini CLI is
5:10:31
different. It's an agent. It can run commands. It can execute code. It can
5:10:37
test things. It can debug issues. It can even commit changes to Git. It's like
5:10:42
the difference between having a smart keyboard and having a smart colleague. And because it's open source, the
5:10:48
developer community is going crazy. People are already building extensions, adding new features, making it even more
5:10:54
powerful. Let me give you some real examples of what this can do. Example one, you want to build a Discord bot.
5:11:00
You tell Gemini CLI to build a Discord bot that answers questions from a FAQ file. It reads your existing files. It
5:11:08
understands your project structure. It writes the bot code. It tests the code. It even handles the deployment. All from
5:11:14
one simple request. Example two. You have a folder full of images, different formats, different sizes. You want them
5:11:21
all converted to PNG and renamed with dates from the photo data. You tell Gemini CLI to do this. It processes
5:11:27
every image. It reads the metadata. It converts the formats. It renames everything. Done. Example three. You
5:11:33
want a full screen web app that shows your GitHub issues for a wall display in your office. You describe what you want.
5:11:39
Gemini CLI builds the entire app. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, real-time data from
5:11:45
GitHub. Beautiful design, ready to deploy. These aren't fake examples. These are real use cases from Google's
5:11:50
documentation. This thing can replace hours of manual work with a single command. This isn't just a cool tech
5:11:56
demo. This is a game changer. First, it makes AI accessible to everyone. You don't need to be a programmer. You don't
5:12:01
need to understand APIs. You just describe what you want in plain English. Second, it runs locally. That means your
5:12:07
sensitive business data doesn't go to the cloud. It stays on your computer. That's huge for security and privacy.
5:12:12
Third, it's free. No subscription fees, no usage limits that matter, no vendor
5:12:18
lockin. But here's the real kicker. It makes small businesses competitive with big corporations. Big companies have
5:12:24
teams of developers. They have big budgets for software. They have resources to build custom tools. Small
5:12:30
businesses usually can't compete with that. But now, a single person with Gemini CLI can do what used to take a
5:12:37
team of developers. You can build custom apps for your business. You can automate boring tasks. You can create content at
5:12:43
scale. You can compete with companies 10 times your size. So, how do you actually get this thing? You need three things.
5:12:50
First, you need a computer. Mac, Windows, or Linux, doesn't matter. Second, you need NodeJS installed.
5:12:56
That's a free programming tool. Takes 2 minutes to install. Third, you need a Google account. That's it. You run one
5:13:02
command in your terminal. It asks you to sign in with your Google account and boom, you're ready to go. No credit card
5:13:08
required. No trial period that expires. No hidden fees. You literally get access
5:13:13
to one of the most powerful AI models in the world for free. I'll put the exact installation instructions in the
5:13:19
description below. This thing supports something called MCP, model context protocol. That's a fancy way of saying
5:13:25
it can connect to other tools and services. Want it to connect to your database? It can do that. Want it to
5:13:31
integrate with your project management tools? It can do that. Want it to work with your existing scripts and
5:13:37
automation? It can do that. And because it's open source, developers are already building crazy extensions. There's an
5:13:43
extension for image generation using Google's Imagin model. There's an extension for video creation using
5:13:49
Google's VO model. There's an extension for music generation using Google's LIA model. It's like having access to
5:13:55
Google's entire AI toolkit from your terminal. Google is in an AI war with
5:14:00
Open AI, with Microsoft, with everyone. They need developers to use their AI models. They need people to build on
5:14:07
their platform. So, they're doing what Google does best. They're making their best technology free, just like they did
5:14:13
with Android, just like they did with Chrome. The goal isn't to make money from Gemini CLI directly. The goal is to
5:14:20
get you into the Google ecosystem. Once you're using Gemini CLI, you'll probably use Google AI Studio. You'll probably
5:14:28
use Google Cloud. You'll probably use other Google services. But here's the thing, that's actually good for us
5:14:33
because it means they have to keep making it better. They have to keep it free. They have to keep innovating. Competition is good for customers.
5:14:40
People are already doing incredible things with this. One developer used it to migrate an entire codebase from one
5:14:45
framework to another. Something that would normally take weeks done in a few hours. A content creator used it to
5:14:51
generate a complete video series. Scripts, visuals, everything. All from a simple topic description. A small
5:14:57
business owner used it to build a custom inventory management system. No coding knowledge required. These aren't
5:15:02
hypothetical examples. These are real people getting real results. And remember, this tool has been available
5:15:07
for less than 24 hours. Imagine what people will be doing with it in a month. We're moving toward a world where every
5:15:14
computer has an AI agent. Not just AI assistants, but actual AI agents that
5:15:19
can do work. This is the first real step in that direction. The businesses that start using this stuff now will have a
5:15:25
massive advantage over the ones that wait. This isn't like social media where you can jump in later and catch up. This is like the internet itself. The early
5:15:32
adopters win big. So, what should you do right now? First, go install this thing.
5:15:37
Even if you're not technical, even if you've never used a terminal before, the installation is simple. Second, start
5:15:42
with small experiments. Ask it to help with simple tasks. Get comfortable with how it works. Third, think about your
5:15:49
business processes. What tasks do you do repeatedly? What takes too much time?
5:15:54
What could be automated? Fourth, start building. Use this to create tools for
5:15:59
your business. Automate workflows. Build custom solutions. Don't wait. Don't
5:16:04
think about it. Don't plan to do it later. Do it now because your competitors are probably already doing it. I've been in the AI space for a
5:16:11
while now. I've seen a lot of tools come and go. But this feels different. This feels like a watershed moment. Google
5:16:16
just gave everyone access to enterprise level AI capabilities for free. They
5:16:22
just made it possible for a single person to do what used to require a team. They just changed the game for every business owner, entrepreneur, and
5:16:28
creator. You can either take advantage of this opportunity or you can watch other people take advantage of it. The
5:16:34
question isn't whether AI is going to change your industry. The question is whether you're going to lead that change
5:16:39
or get left behind by it. All right, so here's what I want you to do first. If you want to scale your business and save
5:16:46
hundreds of hours with AI automation, check out my AI profit boardroom. It's the best place to get more customers and
5:16:53
streamline your operations with cuttingedge AI tools. Link is in the comments and description. Second, if you
5:16:59
want a free SEO strategy session to see how we can get you more leads and customers, book a call with my team,
5:17:06
link is in the comments and description. Third, we have a complete SOP and process for using tools like Gemini CLI
5:17:13
inside the AI success lab. You'll get step-by-step tutorials, over a 100 use cases, and access to our community of
5:17:21
12,000 members who are already using AI to transform their businesses. You can get all the video notes from this
5:17:28
tutorial there, too. Links are in the comments and description. Remember, Julian Goldie reads every single
5:17:33
comment. So, drop a comment below and let me know what you're going to build with Gemini CLI. Are you going to
5:17:40
automate your content creation, build custom tools for your business, or maybe create something completely new? I want
5:17:46
to hear about it. And if you build something cool, I might feature it in a future video. Thanks for watching, and
5:17:51
I'll see you in the next one. Google just dropped Gemini 2.5 flashlight and
5:17:56
it's their fastest, cheapest AI model ever. But here's the crazy part. I spent hours testing this thing, and the
5:18:02
results shocked me. We're talking about an AI that costs almost nothing but beats expensive models at coding games.
5:18:08
I built multiple games in seconds. I compared it head-to-head with premium models, and what I found will blow your
5:18:14
mind. This could change everything about how we use AI. Hey, if we haven't met
5:18:19
already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie
5:18:24
Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. And
5:18:31
today, we're talking about something massive. Google just announced Gemini 2.5 Flashlight. And when I say just
5:18:37
announced, I mean like hours ago. Now, Google's calling this their fastest and cheapest 2.5 model yet. But here's what
5:18:44
got my attention. They're claiming it beats their old models on everything. Coding, math, science, reasoning,
5:18:52
everything. So, I did what I always do. I ignored the marketing hype and I tested it myself for hours. Real world
5:18:58
tests. No BS benchmarks that don't mean anything. I built games. I created landing pages. I compared it directly
5:19:05
with Gemini 2.5 Pro, which costs way more money. And what I found was shocking. A cuz here's the thing. This
5:19:11
model costs almost nothing to use. We're talking fractions of a cent per request.
5:19:17
But in some tests, it actually beat the expensive models. That's not supposed to happen. So, in this video, I'm going to
5:19:23
show you exactly what Gemini 2.5 flashlight can do. The real results, not the marketing fluff. I'll show you where
5:19:29
it crushes the competition and where it falls flat on its face. Plus, I'll show you exactly how to use it for free right
5:19:36
now. No credit card needed. Because if this model is as good as Google claims, it could save you hundreds or even
5:19:41
thousands of dollars on AI costs while actually giving you better results. But first, let me explain what this thing
5:19:47
actually is and why it matters. So, here's what Google just dropped on us. Gemini 2.5 flashlight is their new
5:19:54
preview model. And when they say preview, they mean you can use it right now for free. No credit card, no payment
5:19:59
required. Just go to AI Studio and start using it. Now, Google's calling this their most costefficient and fastest 2.5
5:20:07
model yet. But here's what makes it different from everything else they've released. It comes in two modes, thinking mode and non-thinking mode. In
5:20:14
thinking mode, the AI actually thinks through problems before answering. Like,
5:20:19
you can literally see it working through the problem step by step. This gives you better results, but takes a bit longer
5:20:25
and costs more if you're using the API. In non-thinking mode, it just gives you answers fast. super fast. Like crazy
5:20:33
fast. And here's the kicker. Even in non-thinking mode, it still beats the old 2.0 flashlight on everything.
5:20:38
Coding, math, science, reasoning, everything. But the real question is, how does it perform in the real world?
5:20:45
Because benchmarks are nice and all, but I care about one thing. Can this thing
5:20:50
actually help me build stuff that works? So, I put it through my brutal real world test. The same test I use for
5:20:57
every AI model guy. I started with something simple. I asked it to build a Space Invaders game. Complete HTML, CSS,
5:21:05
JavaScript, one prompt, make it look amazing, and trigger loads of dopamine.
5:21:10
Now, here's where it gets interesting. I ran the exact same prompt on Gemini 2.5 Pro at the same time. Remember, 2.5 Pro
5:21:18
costs way more money. Is supposed to be the smart powerful model. Flashlight finished first. Way first. But that's
5:21:25
not the crazy part. The crazy part is flashlight actually worked perfectly on the first try. The game looked good. It
5:21:32
played smooth. Everything worked. Gemini 2.5 Pro, it failed. Completely failed
5:21:38
the one-shot test. Didn't even create a working game. I'm staring at my screen thinking, "Wait, what? The cheap, fast
5:21:44
model just beat the expensive smart model. But maybe that was just luck." So, I tested it again. This time, I
5:21:50
asked both models to build a dopamine drums app. Something visual with sound effects. Again, one prompt. flashlight
5:21:56
coded it out super fast. Added all the visual effects. But here's the thing, it forgot the audio. So, I just told it add
5:22:03
audio and boom, fixed instantly. Gemini 2.5 Pro still coding, taking forever.
5:22:09
And when it finally finished, the output was worse. Way worse. Now, I'm starting to think something's going on here. So,
5:22:14
I pushed it harder. I asked it to build a Sonic game as a single HTML file. This is where most AI models start to break
5:22:21
down. Flashlight delivered a playable Sonic game. Not perfect, but playable. The graphics were basic, but it worked.
5:22:26
Then I asked it to build a Flappy Bird game. Again, one shot. And you know what? It nailed it. The game worked perfectly. The physics felt right. The
5:22:33
difficulty was spoton. I'm playing this Flappy Bird game built by a model that costs almost nothing. And I'm thinking,
5:22:40
this changes everything. But wait, there's more. Remember how I said this thing is fast? Let me show you exactly
5:22:46
how fast. I used it to build a complete SEO calculator landing page. Beautiful
5:22:51
design, working JavaScript, responsive layout, the whole thing. It took seconds, not minutes. Seconds. I've used
5:22:59
Claude Sonic 4, GPT4, all the expensive models. None of them code this fast. And
5:23:04
the quality, it wasn't perfect, but it was definitely usable for a model that costs almost nothing. The output quality
5:23:10
shocked me. But here's where it gets really interesting. I decided to test it outside of AI Studio. I hooked
5:23:16
Flashlight up to Cursor IDE. This is where AI models usually struggle because
5:23:21
they're working in a real coding environment, not just spitting out code snippets. I asked it to build a complete
5:23:26
landing page for an SEO agency, multiple sections, testimonials, FAQs, the works.
5:23:33
It coded the entire thing in under a minute, a complete functional landing page. Now, the design was pretty
5:23:39
average. Nothing special, but it worked and it was fast. Compare that to other models that either take forever or give
5:23:45
you broken code, and you start to see why this matters. But let's be real here. This model isn't perfect. When I
5:23:52
tested it for complex design work, it fell short. The landing pages looked okay, but not amazing. The color choices
5:23:59
were safe, but boring. For simple games, it did great. But when I asked it to
5:24:04
build more complex interactions, it struggled. And here's something weird I noticed. The outputs were better when I
5:24:10
used AI Studio directly compared to using it through other tools like cursor or open router. Same model, same
5:24:16
prompts, but the quality dropped when I used it through third party tools. Let me show you some numbers that will blow
5:24:21
your mind. I tracked my usage for a full day of heavy testing, building games, creating landing pages, generating
5:24:28
content, debugging code, everything. Total cost with flashlight less than two
5:24:34
cents. Not $2,2. Compare that to Claude Son A4 where the
5:24:40
same amount of work will cost around $30 or GPT4 where you're looking at about $25. We're talking about a 99% cost
5:24:48
reduction while getting similar or sometimes better results. But here's what makes this even crazier. When I
5:24:53
used thinking mode, which gives you the best quality outputs, my cost went up to about 8 cents for the entire day. 8
5:25:00
cents for premium AI reasoning that rivals models costing 300 times more.
5:25:05
Let me tell you about a few more tests that really opened my eyes. I asked Flashlight to create a crocodile pinball
5:25:10
game based on a diagram. Sounds weird, right? But I wanted to test its ability to take visual inspiration and turn it
5:25:16
into interactive code. First attempt was pretty basic, just static elements. But when I told it to make the UI more fun
5:25:24
and add JavaScript to animate the ball, flippers, and score, it delivered. Not perfect, but functional and fast. Then I
5:25:31
tested content creation. I asked it to write email sequences, blog posts, some social media content. The quality was
5:25:38
surprisingly good. Not as polished as Claude, but definitely usable for most businesses. And here's something
5:25:44
interesting. When I tested it for data analysis tasks, passing CSV files,
5:25:49
creating charts, analyzing trends, it handled everything I threw at it. This
5:25:54
isn't just a coding model. It's a legitimate all-purpose AI assistant that happens to cost almost nothing. Now,
5:26:00
let's talk about what's actually under the hood here. Flashlight comes with a full 1 million token context window.
5:26:06
That means you can feed it massive amounts of data and it remembers everything. It supports multimodal input, text, images, video, audio.
5:26:13
Though, right now, it only outputs text. It connects to Google search and can execute code in real time. So, it's not
5:26:18
just generating code. It's actually running and testing it. And here's the kicker. It can scale compute resources
5:26:23
dynamically based on your budget. Need faster results? Increase the thinking budget? Want to save money? Turn
5:26:28
thinking off. This level of control is something you usually only see in enterprise level AI systems. So, how
5:26:35
does Flashlight actually compare to the big players? Against Gemini 2.5 Pro, it wins on speed every time. And for simple
5:26:42
coding tasks, it often gives better results on the first try. Against Claude A4 is faster, but Claude gives more
5:26:48
polished outputs. Against GPT4 is way cheaper and faster, but GPT4 handles
5:26:54
complex reasoning better. But here's the thing that matters most. For 90% of the stuff you probably want to build,
5:27:00
flashlight is good enough and it costs almost nothing. Let me get practical for a minute. Here's how real businesses are
5:27:06
already using this. Content creation agencies are using it to draft blog posts, social media content, and email
5:27:14
sequences. The quality is good enough that you just need light editing. Web development shops are using it to
5:27:19
rapidly prototype websites and applications. You can build and test ideas in minutes instead of hours. SEO
5:27:25
agencies like mine are using it to analyze competitor content, generate title ideas, and create content outlines
5:27:31
at scale. And here's something cool. Because it's so cheap, you can afford to run multiple versions of the same prompt
5:27:37
to get different perspectives. Then pick the best one. Try doing that with Claude or GPT4 and you'll go bankrupt. Want to
5:27:45
try this yourself? Here's exactly how to get started. Go to studio.google.com.
5:27:51
Sign in with your Google account. Click on the model dropown and select Gemini 2.5 flashlight preview. Make sure you
5:27:58
turn on thinking mode if you want better results. Though honestly, even non-thinking mode is pretty good for
5:28:04
most stuff. Then just start building. Ask it to create whatever you want. Games, websites, tools, whatever. The
5:28:09
best part, it's completely free. No credit limits I've hit. No payment required. You can also use it through
5:28:15
Open Router if you want to connect it to other tools, but that will cost you money. Though honestly, the costs are so
5:28:20
low, it barely matters. Here's what I think after spending hours testing this thing. Gemini 2.5 flashlight is not
5:28:26
going to replace the top tier models for complex work. If you need the absolute best reasoning or the most polished
5:28:32
outputs, stick with Claude Sonet 4 or GPT4. But for everyday AI tasks,
5:28:38
building simple apps, creating content, basic coding, this thing is a gamecher. It's fast enough that you don't lose
5:28:44
momentum while working. It's cheap enough that you don't worry about costs and it's good enough that you actually get usable results. Plus, it's free
5:28:51
right now. So, there's literally no reason not to try it. Will it stay free forever? Probably not. Google usually
5:28:56
starts with free previews, then adds pricing later, but right now, while it's free, this might be the best deal in AI.

5:29:58
you in the next one. Breaking news. Gemini 2.5 Flash Light, the fastest,
5:30:04
most costefficient model from 2.5 is available from Google. We're going to be
5:30:09
testing out today and running through the benchmarks as well. By the way, you can get access to this for free inside
5:30:15
AI Studio. Just make sure you select flashlight preview. I've not got my credit cards plugged in and it still
5:30:21
works. So, let's run through what it means, how it goes, etc. So, you can see here flash 2.5 and 2.5 Pro are generally
5:30:29
available. But the main one here is Gemini 2.5 Flash Light. This is the new
5:30:34
model from Google. As you said, as you can see here, they said we're also introducing a preview of the new 2.5
5:30:40
Flash Light. our most costefficient and fastest 2.5 model yet. And you can see
5:30:47
here it has all round higher quality than 2.0 flashlight on coding, math, science, reasoning and multimodal
5:30:53
benchmarks. And you can see some of the comparisons here on the benchmarks. All right. So for example, this is the new
5:30:59
model 2.5 flash light. And also you got two different modes here. So you have thinking and non-thinking. So if you go
5:31:05
over to AI Studio for example and you select in the top right here 2.5 Gemini 2.5 then you're going to select flash
5:31:12
light preview 0617 and then from here you can actually switch between thinking mode and
5:31:18
non-thinking mode. Right? Obviously thinking mode you're going to get better results but it's going to take a little bit longer to reply and also if you're
5:31:25
coding on the API it's going to cost more money as well. Right? So if we compare these on the benchmarks we see how they perform. So you got flashlight
5:31:32
versus 2.0 flash. So this is actually a lot cheaper in terms of comparisons. Way
5:31:38
way cheaper than Gemini 2.5 Pro as well. Pretty much a tenth for the price. If we have a look at his performance here. So
5:31:44
there is a huge difference in terms of humanity's last exam. So Gemini 2.5 Pro
5:31:49
scores 21% on that. Whereas for example flashlight scores 5%. If we look at science, Gemini 2.5 Pro, which is
5:31:57
obviously a much more powerful but more expensive model, scores 86% whereas flashlight non-thinking scores 64% and
5:32:04
flashlight thinking scores 66%. So compared to Gemini 2.5 flash, this is a
5:32:10
much lighter model, but it's a much cheaper model as well and is very fast when I've tested out as well. So you can
5:32:16
see all the key benchmarks here in terms of how it performs. By the way, if you want to get all the prompts I'm using today, the video notes and all of these
5:32:22
resources like you can see, including the Gemini 2.5 Pro course. Additionally, you want maybe you want a cheat sheet
5:32:28
that runs you through exactly what it means, what the differences are, etc. The performance benchmarks, you can get
5:32:34
that inside the AI success lab link in the comments description. All free as you can see right here. Plus, we give
5:32:40
away free trainers every day. So, let's get back into this now. We're going to start testing this out. So you can get
5:32:46
access on open router if you want to use it. Again it's not free on open router
5:32:51
but if you want to use it from AI studio it is free to use and you know that's how you can use it for free directly.
5:32:57
Okay. So, for example, here what I've said is create a single HTML for an SEO calculator, make it beautiful, great
5:33:04
landing page, great colors, dopamine inducing. And if we plug in this prompt into AI Studio, I actually didn't use
5:33:10
thinking mode for this. It generated the HTML code like crazy fast. So, I'll show you an example of how fast it can reply
5:33:17
in a second. And then you've got all the HTML code right here. Boom. Shackle. Let's copy that over and we'll go over
5:33:23
to LiveWeave to preview it. By the way, some people will comment saying you can build apps inside and preview inside AI
5:33:30
Studio. But on the build section, you can't actually switch between the different APIs, so you don't know which one you're testing. But if we have a
5:33:36
look over here, we can preview the page that we've created. And look at that. Ready to go. Looks pretty nice right
5:33:42
here. Just going to remove some of the JavaScript there cuz that should be in there. Let's remove that. Ah, there we go. All right. Looking much better. Now,
5:33:48
if we have a look at this, this is the page that we generated in like one click, super fast using Gemini 2.5 flash
5:33:56
light preview for free. All right. So, as an example of that, let's copy this out. We'll go back here. We're going to
5:34:02
switch on thinking mode to see if we get a better result and see how fast that is. We'll plug this in, hit run, and you
5:34:08
see how fast it is. It's like it's crazy fast compared to something like Pl or something like that. This is
5:34:14
redonkulously fast, my friends. All right. And then you've got the HTML ready to preview over here. Let's just
5:34:19
make sure that works. Sometimes it doesn't. I'll run some tests on it later today. But look at that. Looks pretty nice, right? And that's with the
5:34:25
thinking mode. Pretty nice design. Should work perfectly. Let's hit calculate my score on that. And yeah, it
5:34:31
works. We've got the personalized SEO score underneath. Nice UI. Very simple, but it works right. Fast, free, easy to
5:34:39
use. Now, if you want to use it on Open Router, you can see it is available. It is going to cost you money if you use it on Open Router, though, so just bear
5:34:45
that in mind. And then you can see between here, okay, what apps accepted. So root code client, etc. And then agent
5:34:52
zero as well is running it pretty good. And then you can see where it's
5:34:57
available. So vertex and AI studio as well. And then additionally, you can
5:35:02
also compare this. So if we compare this now versus let's say we compare it
5:35:08
versus a previous model of flash. So 2. Oh. Yeah. So let's compare it versus a
5:35:15
previous version of flashlight. So this is a new one. Compare them. So the context window is the same which is a million context which is awesome to be
5:35:21
honest cuz I think even claw Sonic 4 is like 200 tokens. And then you can
5:35:27
compare the prices here. So it's a lot cheaper than the 2.0 flashlight model.
5:35:33
So it's slightly more expensive than the 2.0 flashlight model. Just so you can see here. And then you can test these
5:35:39
side by side. But yeah, we can actually go in the chat and compare them as well. So if we take 2.0 flashlight and we
5:35:46
compare that versus 2.5 flash, right? And then let's plug in the same prompt
5:35:52
over here. So let me go back to the chat room over here. And we'll compare which one performs the best. So we've got 2.0
5:35:58
flashlight. 2.5 flashlight came back to us way quicker. They're both pretty fast at coding, like you can see. We'll
5:36:04
compare the outputs in a second. See side by side which one performs the best. All right. So, we got the outputs
5:36:09
really fast as you can see. Let's expand this. And this is the 2.5 output.
5:36:17
We'll plug that in. There we go. So, that's 2.5. And actually, to be honest, like I would say the output from AI
5:36:25
Studio was much nicer than Open Router. Just something to bear in mind there as well. So, like seems like the performance with the exact same prompt
5:36:32
seems to change depending on which platform you use. And then we can plug this in and that is 2.0. So this is 2.0.
5:36:42
So to be honest, if I'm looking at the UI, this is 2.5. This is 2.0. Like the actual UI with the colors
5:36:50
looks more modern on this side, but blue on blue doesn't make any sense. And then on the right hand side, you have the 2.0
5:36:57
model. But I would probably use this cuz the colors are actually usable, right? It actually works. So it's up to you,
5:37:04
you know, what you think about this, but to me it doesn't look like a massive difference to be honest. Now, if you
5:37:10
want to start coding with this, what you can do is you can open up something like Visual Studio Code. And actually inside
5:37:16
the AI success lab, you'll see two different courses on Visual Studio Code
5:37:22
and Rode if you want to learn how to use this stuff. But basically from here, if you want to code with this, you can just go to something like plan, we can go to
5:37:29
settings, we can type in Rita, then we can do from here. is just type in flash 2.5. If we can't find it like that, then
5:37:37
we'll type in 2.5 here. And there we go. 2.5 flash preview. And that's how we can
5:37:43
start using this. Hit save over there and then start coding with this. The other way is you should be able to
5:37:50
switch to Google Gemini. Then we're going to switch to
5:37:55
2.5, but I actually can't see it in the list of Google settings. Right. So you got a 2.5 Pro preview, flash preview,
5:38:01
but there's no flashlight preview there. So yeah, best way to use this is with open router. There we go. And then just
5:38:10
make sure you're using flashlight preview. 0617. Hit save. And then you
5:38:15
can switch between plan and app mode. I'm just going to go straight into ad mode because I'm a man of action. And
5:38:20
then you can for example just take that same prompt that we took earlier. Plug that in. Copy this. Go over to the
5:38:26
Visual Studio Code and then type this in. Right. By the way, I'm just showing these examples for the sake of speed. If
5:38:33
you want to get a bunch more prompts, we got loads inside the AI success lab, including all of these prompts right
5:38:39
here. I just want to show you some quick examples and show you the same prompt across each platform. So, you can see
5:38:44
that's coding out now. It is crazy fast. And now we've got that ready to go. It's
5:38:50
creating the JS and we got that rocking and rolling, my friends. All right. So
5:38:56
now it's editing the index. And then if we open this up, we have the web page
5:39:02
designed and ready to go. So that's how you can use it inside Visual Studio Code if you want to. Pretty cool to be
5:39:09
honest. Like even using the paid API, look how cheap that was. Like 0.00. So
5:39:14
it's not even cost you a scent. This cost 0 0.36
5:39:19
to generate that. So, super cheap. So, let's close that up. But yeah, you can see how it works, what it does, the
5:39:26
benchmarks, how to code with it, how to use it inside AI Studio, some of the outputs as an example, plus how it
5:39:31
compares versus 2.0 versus 2.5 Flash. And bear in mind as well, you've got 2.5
5:39:37
Pro and 2.5 Flash now stable and generally available, too. If you want to
5:39:43
use this in a different way, you can actually go to Gemini, I think. And then let's have a
5:39:49
look. It's 2.5 Flash. Yeah. So, you just use it inside Open Router and AI Studio.
5:39:55
And there we go. So, thanks so much for watching. If you want to get access to all the prompts from today, plus loads of other different tests, you can get
5:40:01
that inside the AI success lab. This also comes with loads of other trainings, as you can see on the left hand side here. And inside the
5:40:07
classroom, we have loads of different trainings. likes. Additionally, inside the community, we give away new free trainings every single day, like you can
5:40:14
see. So, we're sharing new trainings all the time. If you want free gifts daily, this community of 11,500 people and if

5:40:59
here, we have all our best agents, templates, workflows, including, for example, all these new NA10 workflows
5:41:05
that we're adding. Like for example, a BO3 Facebook ad generator, video workflow, perplexity scraper bot, we've
5:41:12
got video shorts clippers, AI music generators, oneclick book generators, like all sorts of crazy stuff. And
5:41:19
additionally, if you want live help with this, you want live support. If you want to be able to ask us questions and get tutorials in real time, then we actually
5:41:26
have three live coaching calls per week. And if you can't watch them, if you can't make them, then you can actually
5:41:31

5:41:37
just want to get us to automate all of this stuff for you, feel free to book in a free AI strategy session link in the
5:41:43
comments description. What we're going to do on that call is basically look at where you spend your time, figure out
5:41:48
what you need to automate, right? We'll come up with a game plan and then if it makes sense for us to do it, we'll just implement that for you and you can
5:41:55
become a client of us. So feel free to get that link in the comments description. Appreciate you watching. I just discovered how to automate your
5:42:01
entire browser using Gemini 2.5 Pro completely free. And what I'm about to show you will transform how you think
5:42:08
about AI productivity forever. And yes, this AI is actually typing right now on
5:42:13
Twitter and posting even whilst I'm talking to you. And you're going to discover the secret Chrome extension
5:42:18
that lets AI agents control your browser and talk to other AI agents whilst you sit back just like I am and let the
5:42:25
magic happen. Plus, I'll show you how I got Gemini to automatically build entire applications, send emails, and post
5:42:30
social media content without touching my keyboard once. and the shocking moment AI took complete control of my browser
5:42:37
started conversations with chat GBT and Claude on its own. So we're going to talk about how to automate your browser
5:42:43
with Gemini 2.5 Pro. So if you want to automate your browser with Gemini 2.5
5:42:49
Pro, you can use this free Chrome extension called Nano Browser and then you can install this to Google Chrome.
5:42:55
You can see some examples of how it works right here. And essentially, you can use your existing instance of Google
5:43:01
Chrome and then start navigating across your browser. Now, this is 100% free. It
5:43:06
can also run locally, so it's more privacy focused. Additionally, you can use the flexible LLM options. So, you
5:43:13
can switch between different LMS essentially and also it's fully open source. So, you can see here on it's
5:43:20
available on GitHub as you can see. So, it's open source. But if you want to use it directly, you can just go to your
5:43:26
Chrome extensions and then from here you're going to select nano browser. Make sure you've already installed it
5:43:31
from the Chrome extension and then you can start using it. If you want to get all the links from today, feel free to get that inside the AI success lab and
5:43:38
we'll get straight into this. So I've got a bunch of tests that I want to try out here. And to set this up,
5:43:43
essentially what you're going to do is you're going to go to your settings inside Nan Browser. And this is how you can get your browser agent to start
5:43:50
using it for you. So, for example, here you can see I've typed in my AI my API key. If you want to get an API key, you
5:43:56
can get a free one from AI Studio. You don't need to pay. And then from here, just click on get API key. And then you
5:44:02
can just create an API key for free directly inside AI studio. Doesn't cost you a penny. And then you can start
5:44:10
using your magic, right? So, for example, if you go to the options, you
5:44:15
can select the models. And inside here, we can select whichever model we want, right? So if we've put in our API key as
5:44:21
Gemini like you can see then we can put in the details. We can add multiple different providers as well. So you can
5:44:27
use open Deep Seek, Atropic, OpenAI, Grock, O Lama even. So you can use like a locally hosted API. But essentially
5:44:36
from here you can then change the temperature. Temperature will change the creativity and you can switch between
5:44:42
who's a planner, who's a navigator and who's the validator to check if tasks are completed successfully. So, if you
5:44:48
go inside the what can I help section here and we'll say okay, let's just test this out. See if it actually works. So,
5:44:54
I'm going to go over here. I'm just going to make sure I'm signed into Bolt and we see if it can actually build an
5:45:00
app for us directly inside the chat. So, let's put inside here
5:45:07
inside the request section. Go to bold new and build an SEO app. We'll hit send and we'll see what happens next.
5:45:15
So this is using Gemini 2.5 Pro and you can see that the AI has now navigated to
5:45:20
the other AI and it's beginning to use it. Right? So now it said input text to specify
5:45:26
building an SEO app and it's actually done it. Right? So it said build an SEO app and then submit the input text by
5:45:33
pressing enter. It is extremely fast when it's doing this and you can see it's interacting. You know I'm not typing anything or anything like that.
5:45:41
You can also stop the operator at any time if you click stop in the right hand side. And now it is creating the
5:45:48
project. So it's now built out the blog. Again, this is the AI using my browser.
5:45:54
I'm not controlling it. I've just literally given it a task and it's gone off and completed it. Right. We've got
5:45:59
the full app built by the AI here. So we've got AI agents essentially talking to AI agents inside our browser, which
5:46:07
is pretty wild if you ask me. And then you can see this is actually deployed now as well. So it's on a local host and
5:46:14
it's actually getting the source code for SEO implementation. So it's like clicking through the code and that sort
5:46:19
of thing. I'm going to stop it there, but that is pretty wild that it can just generate a blog as you can see and start
5:46:25
using that. Lucky Leo says, "How can I use Claude for free? Your videos are cool. Thank you." So you just go to
5:46:31
Claude AI and then you can start using it. They have a free plan, right? And inside the free plan, you can start
5:46:37
using this directly here. You can also get access to this inside po.com. So if you want to
5:46:43
use it for free as well, you can use it inside po.com. That's another option. And you can get Claude Sonic 4 and other
5:46:49
models directly inside PO as well. So that's basically how you can use it. So
5:46:55
the browser has been completely controlled by Gemini 2.5 Pro. We've managed to
5:47:01
automate our browser using this process. What we're going to do from here is you
5:47:06
can now test it on the next test. Right? So far it's passed test one out of one. Let's
5:47:12
now say okay ask cheap and asking what's the secret to happiness. So
5:47:18
let's go back over here and we'll just use the chat and then from here it's now
5:47:23
navigated to chat GPT. Again it's crazy fast. The other thing that I like as well about this is it doesn't require
5:47:29
like any use of the terminal or messing around with API keys and setting up av
5:47:34
file. It's just like literally, okay, you want to set this up. Boom. There you go. It's actually failed to run that
5:47:42
task. Let's see if it can use Claude instead. It's going to say open up Claude
5:47:47
or Yeah, let's say open up Claude. And it's actually using Claude. So, it's typed in what's the secret to happiness?
5:47:55
type that question in and now it's having a little philosophical conversation with Claude directly,
5:48:01
right? So again, you can get your AI to talk to AI. Pretty simple and easy right there. Okay, so next up, what we can
5:48:09
say, and I'm just going to switch X accounts to a test one instead. So let's
5:48:15
switch over to AICO Mastery, which is totally different Twitter account I own.
5:48:21
We're going to stop that. Stop the validator. And then we're going to go inside here, take the prompt, and we'll
5:48:28
say go on X and post a terrifying, menacing, but funny tweet about the future of AR. So, let's hit send. Lucky
5:48:35
Leo is asking, can you run Claude on terminal? Yes, you can, but it's going to cost you
5:48:42
money, right? You need to be on the I think it's just the basic plan that you can use it for now. But yeah, if you
5:48:47
want to use cord locally, then you have to pay for claw code. Let's see if this works.
5:48:53
There we go. I will soon write tweets so good you'll wonder if you ever had an
5:48:58
original thought. Resistance is futile. Also, it's learning to make toast. Be
5:49:04
very afraid or hungry. So, it's written the tweet. It's posting the tweet and it just did
5:49:11
that fully automatically for free using Gemini 2.5 Pro. Pretty crazy stuff right there. So, we're going to go with
5:49:19
another prompt. So, I want to test and push it to the limits where you find out
5:49:25
if it can break or not. But yeah, this is crazy. So, I'm going to say now go to openarch.ai.
5:49:31
Design a funny but scary picture about AI agents taking over the world. Let's see if it can do that. And it says task
5:49:37
failed. The extensions gallery cannot be scripted. Interesting. Let's try and
5:49:42
open it up again. So, it's now navigated to open art. Let's see if it can create
5:49:47
an image. And it's struggling to do that to be fair.
5:49:53
It is struggling to do that. Let's see if it can now work on this one instead. So, it's good to show you this
5:50:00
cuz then you know, okay, what are the limitations here? Is it magic or does it get stuck sometimes? So, let's see if it
5:50:06
can. So, it's typed in a futuristic city, but then it deleted it and it
5:50:13
can't figure that out from what I can see. So, it is struggling on some tasks. that one. It couldn't create images.
5:50:21
Let's try one final one. So, I'm going to say, okay, go to sununo.com and create a funny song. So, it's navigated
5:50:28
there. Now, it's put a silly song about a cat who thinks he's a dog.
5:50:35
It's getting stuck on the capture. Yeah, it looks like it really got stuck on that. Seems to have failed. It did
5:50:41
create something on So, let's have a look what it actually did create.
5:50:46
So, we got that here. This is like a AI music creator. Yeah, I think that's an old one to be fair. So, I think
5:50:54
basically from what I can see, it can do basic stuff like tweeting. It could
5:51:00
probably do outreach for you. It could probably send emails for you and that sort of thing, but it does seem to struggle with creating
5:51:08
images and also generating songs. It seems to like struggle with interacting with websites. doesn't really know very
5:51:14
well if that makes sense. Let's try one more here. We'll just go to a random test Gmail
5:51:22
account and I'm going to say go to here and write an email
5:51:29
to me juliani.com. Let's see if it can do that. Yeah. So,
5:51:35
now it's starting to work again. It's navigated to Gmail. It's clicked on the
5:51:40
compose button. It's filled in. So, it's typing in my email address here.
5:51:46
Seems to be working so far. I'm feeling optimistic. Now, it's filled in the email body. So,
5:51:52
it wrote, "Nano browser is very good." It's typed in the subject line as well.
5:51:58
And it sent the message, my friends. Look at that. Boom.
5:52:03
Sent the message. No problemmo. No big deal. It's just an AI sending emails
5:52:09
inside a browser for free using a Chrome extension. That's pretty crazy to be fair. It only failed on a couple of
5:52:14
tests. Everything else it seemed to do really well. If you want to see the notes on how to set it up, everything else, feel free to get that inside the
5:52:21

Appreciate you watching. See you on the next one. Cheers. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 065,
5:53:54
the latest update that literally just came out today. We're going to be comparing that versus Clawude 4 to see
5:54:00
which one performs the best. Now, if you're not sure about the new update and what it means, so there's a new version of Gemini 2.5 Pro. You can get access
5:54:07
inside Open Router and also inside AI Studio. And it's had a 24 point ELO
5:54:14
jump. It's supposed to be better at reasoning and also have enhanced creativity. We're going to be testing
5:54:19
them side by side today and seeing which one performs the best. By the way, if you want this cheat sheet and all the
5:54:24
prompts from today, feel free to get that inside the AI success lab. And we're going to get straight into this. All right, so let's pull them up side by
5:54:32
side. We'll see which one performs the best. We're going to run this through a coding gauntlet and test them out. Just
5:54:40
see which one gives us the best output side by side. So, the first prompt that
5:54:45
we're going to test out is build a beat racer game. We're going to make sure that we have Pro Preview selected. By
5:54:51
the way, you can use both of these models for free. Claude force on it is free up to a limit and also with AI
5:54:56
studio. What we're also going to do is select extended thinking on. And additionally, in fact, we'll select Opus
5:55:02
4 because that tends to be better for coding in general. And we'll run both of these models and just see sidebyside
5:55:08
which one performs best. Now, one thing you're going to notice straight off the bat is because this is an early release,
5:55:14
right? This is a preview model and version of Gemini 2.5 Pro, there's no canvas option. So, we're going to have
5:55:21
to run the code that we get back from AI Studio inside LiveWeave just to test the outputs. Whereas Claude
5:55:28
Forson can actually preview stuff directly inside the canvas. I also want to see how these models perform in terms
5:55:34
of speed. So, we gave these prompts at the same time and we'll see which one performs the best. To be fair, it seems
5:55:41
like AI Studio blasts out the code. Like, it's blasting out tons of code line by line a lot quicker from what I
5:55:47
can see. Additionally, whilst we're waiting for these, let's run through the benchmarks here. So, if you go to open
5:55:54
router, we can actually compare these side by side versus clawed for opus.
5:56:00
Now, if you're coding with the API, this is going to cost you money for either model, right? So, Gemini 2.5 Pro and the
5:56:06
API of Claude for Opus are both paid models, and you can see how they perform
5:56:11
side by side. So Google has a much higher context window than Claude by 5x,
5:56:17
right? 1 million context window versus 200K. It's actually 1.05 million now.
5:56:23
And if you compare the providers side by side. So this is by Anthropic. This is
5:56:29
by Vertex. Also, if we check this out, so look at the difference in price here. Claude for Opus, $15. Input per million
5:56:37
tokens. input for Gemini 2.5 Pro preview 0605 is 1.25 to five million, right? And
5:56:44
then for Alpa, $10 per million tokens versus 75 per million tokens, right? So,
5:56:51
Opus is a lot more expensive with a much lower context window. But let's see how
5:56:57
they perform in real life. We've got AI Studio still coding out right here, whereas we have Claude Force on it with
5:57:04
a beautiful little beat racer. Let's check this out. I'm actually going to mute that cuz that was way, way too
5:57:10
loud. Let's see what we got back here. I really didn't like the sound effects there. That'll freak me out. You never
5:57:16
know with AI what's it going to come out with, especially on a live stream. So, this is a super hard game to play to be
5:57:23
honest. Like it you got to be right there ready to go. But not bad at all.
5:57:28
Not bad. AI Studio seems to be struggling. It always seems to struggle with like audio jobs, right? So, you can
5:57:33
see here how long it's taking to code out the audio and just writing in numbers.
5:57:39
So, in the meantime, we can just move on to the next task and see which one performs the best. And for that, we're
5:57:46
going to build a whack-a-ole style game with absurdly fast moles and bright
5:57:52
flashing visuals. I'm actually going to remove the audio prompt simply because it just seems to
5:57:59
confuse AI Studio and I don't want that to ruin the tests. Let's run that. And we'll run this on
5:58:06
Opus as well. Fantasy Cloud says to what's great about this newer model, honestly, from what I've seen so far,
5:58:12
Claud is still beating it by a long way. The outputs, the speed,
5:58:17
Claude has nearly finished coding the second task, whereas AI Studio is still on the first one and struggling. So,
5:58:23
from what I can see, you get a much better output from Claude versus anything else. All right, so AI Studio
5:58:28
actually won on speed in the second test. Let's plug that in. See what we get back here. Here we go. Hyper Mole.
5:58:36
What a game. Oh, that is a crazy one. That is hard to play, but I like it. I
5:58:43
like what they've done there. It's a little bit too flashy though for this time in the morning. So, AI Studio has
5:58:49
created something really cool there. Let's see what Claude for Opus does. So, it failed on the last HTTP. There we go.
5:58:56
All right. So, let's copy that. Can we get that to preview on the canvas? It's
5:59:01
trying. Working its magic. And yeah, if you're wondering, so Gemini 2.5 Pro
5:59:06
preview, this is the 0605 model as you can see on screen here. So you can see
5:59:13
that this is the latest model from Google. Just came out literally a few hours ago. So let's try Claude's output
5:59:21
here. Here we go. I'm still going to say that Claude won there, to be honest.
5:59:26
Yeah, I would say that's a better game. Just looks a lot more interesting and the UI is nicer. The other one was a bit too crazy on AI Studio to be honest. And
5:59:34
that is super addictive as well. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to say Claude for Sonic
5:59:39
won again there, my friends. He won again. All right. Next up, what we're going to do is we're going to test out
5:59:46
on a new chat here versus AI Studio. We're going to test out creating a nice
5:59:51
little cheat sheet. All right. So, let's say, for example, you need to create a landing page or something like that
5:59:57
really quickly. So, what we're going to do is I'm going to take a prompt that actually ran through Gen Spark and that
6:00:03
created something super nice this morning. This one right here. And I'm going to enable
6:00:08
Google Search. So, we're going to allow grounding with Google Search. So, it can search for stuff from today using Gemini
6:00:14
2.5 Pro preview. We're going to run this prompt. likes. Basically, what we're trying to do here is create like a
6:00:20
beautiful landing page cheat sheet that promotes our funnels, but at the same time creates all the information we need
6:00:25
to know about Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 0605.
6:00:30
And what we're looking for in terms of outputs is obviously design, but also
6:00:36
we're looking for really good information as well. It needs to be presentable for a YouTube
6:00:41
video, that sort of thing. But so far from what I can see, like Claude is
6:00:46
winning by a long way. This AI Studio is going to have to pull something amazing out the back. Claude has failed on that
6:00:52
task. It says Claude is unable to respond to this request. Start a new chat. All right, let's start a new chat. See what we get back.
6:00:58
That's crazy. Look at this. It won't reply. Why is it being so weird? All
6:01:04
right, so what we'll do is we'll go into Open Routter and try inside the chat with Claude. It's going to cost me a
6:01:11
fortune, but that's the price we pay for you. Going to enable web search and see
6:01:17
what we get back. AI Studio has come back with some information, but it's not that well designed. Like I was looking
6:01:23
for a sort of landing page style here. So, I'm going to try that again and just say single HTML landing page. And there
6:01:30
we go. How crazy is that? Like the API responds to me with that prompt, but the chat doesn't. Super weird. It's going to
6:01:37
be hard for them to be Gen Spark to be honest. If you look at Gen Spark's page, like it looks super nice. Got some nice
6:01:43
like confetti animation right there. Clickable links, etc. Links to my
6:01:48
funnels. Nicely designed. It's very hard to beat that, but we'll see what they come back with in a second. So, have the
6:01:57
code back from AI Studio first and then we'll plug this in. See what we got
6:02:04
here. The ultimate dopamine cheat sheet by Julian Goldie. Just come up with a nice little title. Click for a dopamine
6:02:11
rush and you get the confetti animation. That's a lot of confetti right there.
6:02:18
All right, this is pretty nice to be fair. Like maybe it's just better for coding landing pages and stuff. He's
6:02:24
added some nice prompts, links to our funnels, nice tables, FAQs, etc. It's got a
6:02:33
gradiented background as well. I'm going to say that AI Studio did a really good job there. Now, let's wait for Opus to
6:02:40
see what we get back. Now, if you're wondering, okay, what do the benchmarks say? So, you can see here, for example,
6:02:47
you got the benchmarks side by side. So, it is a lot cheaper than Claude Opus 4. And in terms of humanity's last exam is
6:02:55
outperforming Claude Opus, Open 3 and Deep Seek as well at 21.6. 6% for
6:03:02
science. It's outperforming all of the other models. So for a lot of benchmarks here, it's actually outperforming way
6:03:09
better than most of the other models on the benchmarks. It does seem to create better landing pages and code that way.
6:03:15
But let's see how it performs in terms of HTML code versus Opus. So we've got
6:03:20
the code from Opus here. Let's test this out on LiveWeave. Here we go. Let's open this up full
6:03:28
screen and let's share this bad boy out. It's not bad. But I would say Gemini 2.5 Pro beat it by quite a long way there.
6:03:35
So like this design is okay. But if you have a look at Gemini 2.5 Pros, it's
6:03:41
just it's more interesting. It's got more going on. It's added some example prompts, more information, etc. It's
6:03:47
also compared the Gemini 2.5 Pro experiences. It's actually pulled in the
6:03:53
right content here. For example, top scores on Apollo, number one ranking on WebDev Arena, which I know it definitely
6:03:59
has. It's got some nice questions and Q&As's here and also it's linked to our
6:04:04
funnels. So, just to recap here in terms of game creation, Opus seems to be
6:04:10
winning. In terms of generating landing pages, I've actually seen better results
6:04:15
from Gemini 2.5 Pro. Although some people are saying that Claude's
6:04:22
landing page is better because it feels less squished in. All right, so we've
6:04:29
tested out the other thing about Claude there was that he just refused to respond to my request when I put it in the chat. So it would only create it by
6:04:35
the API which obviously costs money which is kind of annoying. Let's test something else out now. So I'm going to
6:04:41
say inside here we'll go to a new chat. I'm going to say okay create an AI
6:04:47
growth calculator helping people understand how they save time with AI automations.
6:04:56
make it fun, confetti animations, crazy, etc. All right, so we're going to do
6:05:02
that inside art studio and then we'll do the same inside Claude. Um, we're cooking him out. We'll say some people
6:05:08
saying Gemini is cooking. Let's see what we got back here. All right, so AI
6:05:14
Studio One on time there on speed. Let's see what we got here. We got the AI time
6:05:20
warp. Pretty nice UI looking good. Unleash AI. It can't exceed the total
6:05:27
work hours. All right, let's put this down. We got too excited there. So, I got to knock those down. Unleash the AI.
6:05:35
The UI is not that nice. So, the only thing I would say is, for example, you can't really read that properly. And also, it doesn't feel that fun. It's
6:05:41
basic, but okay. If we have a look at AI Studio Claude now, and we'll change this to five, for example. Yeah, that's
6:05:49
working nicely. I would say the UI is better than that. It's more readable. I like the flashing lights on the
6:05:54
headline. Looks pretty cool. I can just publish it as well. This was using Claude Sonet, by
6:06:01
the way, which is not even the most powerful model, but you can see here how you can publish it. It looks pretty
6:06:08
good. Yeah, I'm going to say for creating tools and calculators and that sort of thing. Claude Sonet won there as
6:06:13
well. All right, so overall, what am I saying? I'm saying that for landing pages, it seems like Gemini 2.5 Pro just
6:06:21
nudges it on the new version which is 0506, sorry, 0605. But honestly,
6:06:26
overall, Claude Sonic, Claude Opus, I'm sticking with it. You just can't beat it. Is unstoppable. The only thing I
6:06:32
don't like is the price on CLA and obviously if you're optimizing for the API, then you probably use Gemini 2.5
6:06:39
Pro simply because it's a lot cheaper and also it seems to be faster when it's coding out. All right. So, if you want to get all the notes from today, feel
6:06:45
free to get that inside the AI success lab. We've also got a Gemini 2.5 Pro
6:06:50
course, as you can see, along with links to all these other AI automation courses on agents, NAT templates, etc. All the
6:06:58
video notes are right there. We've got 100 different prompts on how to use Gemini 2.5 Pro 0605.
6:07:05
And additionally, all the prompts that I've mentioned from today, we've got inside here, plus another tutorial on
6:07:10
Claude versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, feel free to get all of this inside the AI success lab, completely free. Link in
6:07:16
the comments description. It comes with 9,500 members as you can see right here. And we're just giving away free
6:07:22
trainings. So, make sure you don't miss out on those cuz we give away stuff like every single day. It is absolutely
6:07:28
amazing. And additionally, if you want to connect with me, if you want coaching support, if you want DMs, if you want a community with good vibes that
6:07:34
celebrates wins and shares knowledge together, feel free to get the AI profit boardroom. I'm going to record a video
6:07:40
today answering all of these automations. 28 people posted comments on what they want to see with AI
6:07:46
automations. And each week, I just create a video answering and giving people the answers to every single one
6:07:52
of these automations along with templates. Top of that, we have free coaching calls a week inside the AI
6:07:57
profit boardroom and you can post inside the community anytime you have questions like you can see right here. We get back
6:08:03
to you as soon as you want. For example, Richard posted, I answered him same day and so did Vic who also runc community.
6:08:09
And yeah, it's just an awesome community of good people serious about AI who want to scale their business and make more money. Additionally, we're also adding
6:08:16
loads of different courses and tutorials and templates each week inside here, which is pretty wild. And it's just
6:08:21
focus on one thing. The goal for everyone who joins is to make more money and save time with AI. Additionally, if
6:08:28
you just Julian, I want you to automate all of this stuff for me. Help me figure it out. So, you can jump on a free AI
6:08:34
strategy session. We'll jump on that call and together we can look at your website or your business. Figure out
6:08:40
what you need to automate and then from there put a plan together in terms of doing it for you. All right? And that should save you at least 100 hours a
6:08:47
month, right? That's the whole goal of this. So, feel free to book that in link in the comments description. Breaking news. There's a new Gemini 2.5 Pro
6:08:54
update, 605 update it's called, and it's literally just come out. I'm going to show you exactly how to use it step by
6:09:01
step today. You can see the benchmarks right here. So, how it performs, and it is performing better than ever. It's
6:09:07
beating, for example, OpenAI 03. It's also destroying Claude Opus 4 according
6:09:12
to the benchmarks on science. And additionally, it is winning on the benchmarks for coding. This is the new
6:09:19
announcement from the CEO of Google, right? You see on the webdev arena, it's absolutely dominating right here. So,
6:09:26
it's right at the top of the leaderboard, beating Opus 4 and Sonet Claw 3.7 and also 4.1 by a long way. And
6:09:34
also, we're going to be testing out and showing you exactly how to use it. Now, it's not general availability yet, but
6:09:40
if you want to use it, you can get it for free inside AI Studio, right? So, if you want to get access to this, you can
6:09:46
go inside AI Studio and then from here, you're going to click in the top right. There's a bunch of 2.5 Pro preview
6:09:54
models and this is the one you want to use. You can see here 6 - 05. It is free
6:10:00
to use. I haven't got my credit card plugged in here, but obviously there is a token limit, so you can't absolutely rinse it, but we'll be testing out side
6:10:06
by side and just seeing how it performs. All right, so for example here, let's take some of the prompts. These are all
6:10:13
inside the AI SEO success lab if you want to get access to this stuff and check it out. We'll say build a runner
6:10:19
game where the character speeds up with every jumper power up. We're going to plug that into Gemini using 2.5 Pro
6:10:24
here. We'll click run and see how that does. Wait for that to load. And that's
6:10:30
starting it magic right here. So you can see it's now analyzing the runner working its magic. You can of course use the canvas inside Gemini, but I don't
6:10:37
think it's implemented directly inside Gemini yet. And that's why I'm using AI Studio in case anyone comments about
6:10:42
that. And we'll keep going now and see what we get back. All right. So, we've
6:10:47
got the single HTML being created right here. Wait for that to load. In the meantime, if you want all the video
6:10:53
notes from today, feel free to get that along with Gemini 2.5 Pro inside the AI Success Lab. The AI Success Lab is
6:11:00
completely free. It comes with 100 prompts on how to use Gemini 2.5 Pro along with all the other latest updates
6:11:05
as you can see and a community of 9,500 people. So, let's get back to the AI
6:11:12
studio outputs here. You can see it's now adding the audio inside the HTML. We
6:11:17
can also run this side by side with other examples. So if we actually duplicate this and we'll go inside AI
6:11:24
studio inside the chat and then I'm going to say okay create a Roman
6:11:29
marketplace simulation with people walking around in 3GS.
6:11:36
Hit enter and see what we get back. And you can see this is a thinking mode as well. So it automatically uses thinking
6:11:42
depending on what task you're asking it to do. And we've got thinking mode enabled on the right hand side. So make
6:11:48
sure you just have that allowed. You can set a budget for that as well. And you can connect this to Google search using
6:11:54
the grounding option as well. So that is still coding out on the first test. If
6:12:01
we go over to open router as well, you can see that you can get access to Gemini 2.5 Pro preview as well. These
6:12:08
are the prices if you want to use it directly inside Open Router, so you can start coding with it. Bear in mind this
6:12:15
is a paid model. So it's a paid API inside open router, but you can use it for free inside AI studio like you can
6:12:21
see I'm doing. I'm not getting charged for this. We're going to go over to live or even just preview this bad boy. See
6:12:27
what we get back from the Roman marketplace simulation. Plug that in. And we've also got the HTML runner game.
6:12:35
So let's check this out. Let's compare as well side by side versus the prices
6:12:40
here. So we can see the benchmarks for Gemini 2.5 Pro versus OpenAI 3. So in
6:12:46
terms of input price, it's actually a lot cheaper. So 1.25 versus $10 output
6:12:52
price versus $40 from OpenAI 3. The price is way cheaper. Deepseek is the
6:12:58
only one that's cheaper to be honest. And also OpenAI O4 Mini, which is very
6:13:04
close in terms of comparisons here. It's winning on science and
6:13:11
also humanity's last exam. So, it's performing pretty well right
6:13:17
there. So, if you're wondering what is the update, just to recap here, there's
6:13:22
a new version of Gemini 2.5 Pro. It's outperforming on LMA arena with a 24
6:13:28
point ELO score and also a 35 point ELO jump on Web Dev Arena. and also it's
6:13:34
showing top tier performance on GPQA and humanities last exam. Now, when I'm
6:13:40
testing it, the marketplace test has not worked at all. I'm going to try some
6:13:45
simpler stuff. So, let's go back to the AI success lab and we're going to
6:13:52
test out building a playable synth keyboard with web audio API. The only
6:13:57
thing I don't like about coding in AI Studio is that you don't seem to get previews, right? is you have to copy and
6:14:03
paste everything into live weave manually which is super time consuming
6:14:08
but if you get access to the latest models you know it's worth it here we go here's the web audio API synthesizer
6:14:16
beautiful we got some serious musical beats going on there yeah incredible
6:14:23
absolutely incredible what a time to be alive you can make synth keyboards whenever you want now let's try
6:14:29
something else so I'm gonna say me a captivating endless runner game. We'll plug that in as well. This will be in
6:14:36
P5GS. By the way, if you want to get all these prompts plus a course on Gemini 2.5 Pro,
6:14:42
feel free to get that inside the air profit boardroom. Link in the comments description. And we'll test out the
6:14:48
dinosaur running game now as well. Not bad, but the UI is not great. Like green on green. I don't know where AI learns
6:14:56
its color selection, but that is not ideal, mate. Still works though. It still does it magic. I can't see a huge
6:15:02
difference in the quality of coding in terms of outputs here. Let's try on
6:15:09
Visual Studio Code. Now, I'm going to try with open router and we'll start building some stuff out. So, if we go to
6:15:16
root code, open router client seems to be the best place to use this. So, you can see the apps that are being used for
6:15:24
Gemini 2.5 Pro preview over here. So, you got client as the top one. Let's check it out. If you're not sure how to
6:15:30
set this stuff up, by the way, feel free to check out the AI profit boardroom. Comes with lots of training and all this
6:15:36
stuff. So, we're going to get open router set up now. And I think it'll be
6:15:42
that model pro preview, this one right here. So, we'll hit save on that. It supports browser use as well. So, let's
6:15:50
give this a test run. We can check how much this is going to cost as well. So, I'm excited to test this out. What you
6:15:57
can do is if you want to check out how much it's costing etc. then you can go to
6:16:02
activity inside open router in the top right and you can see how much stuff costs you. All right so for example you
6:16:08
can see here I'm using Gemini 2.5 pro preview 0605. So that is the right model
6:16:13
and then you can see the cost. So it cost us 0.0235 to test this out. So now
6:16:19
you can see client is actually this is quite cool about client. It can create like mermaid diagrams. So, it's planned
6:16:24
out the whole game, how it's going to build it, etc. I just said, let's switch to act mode now, and then we can start
6:16:30
coding. Right. So, if you want to create the mermaid game first, click on plan
6:16:35
and then use act afterwards. Just be careful when you're using the
6:16:41
API because there's a different API for plan and act, right? So, if you switch to act, you have to switch to the API as
6:16:48
well for open router there. So, that's why it gave us that error. Now, it's coding out. seems lightning fast to be
6:16:55
fair. The only thing I hate in Visual Studio Code is all the popups. Like as soon as you open it, you get overwhelmed
6:17:01
with crazy popups. So let's see what we get back now. It's coding out creating logic. In the meantime, we can also use
6:17:07
the chat mode as well if you don't want to use AI Studio. You can use the chat
6:17:12
mode here too. So let's test that out. We're going to try create a pong game
6:17:17
here. And we'll say build a hyperdopamine pong game. made the ball trail neon sparks blah blah blah and see
6:17:24
what we get back. In the meantime, we can also take another one here and plug that into AI Studio. All right, so we've
6:17:32
got AI Studio coding out with Gemini 2.5 Pro. You can also use the chat room inside Open Router. And then
6:17:39
additionally, you can use Visual Studio Code like you can see right here. And if we run the commands, let's see what we
6:17:45
get back. There we go. to be honest, like the visuals are not that nice
6:17:50
compared to something like I'm pretty sure if you build that out in Claude Opus, it would look a lot nicer on the
6:17:56
front end. Let's test that out in the same prompt. So, if we go and take that
6:18:02
prompt over here, then we're going to go over to Claude and I will do another video comparing these two. Then, we're
6:18:08
going to go inside here. We'll select Sonic just for the sake of speed and let's see what we get back from Gemini
6:18:16
versus Claude and see which one performs the best. From what I've seen though, all the outputs have been pretty
6:18:22
underwhelming. Like I thought it would be a lot better considering the benchmarks, but like the actual code
6:18:28
itself that's coming back, not that great when I've tested it inside AI Studio and also inside client as well. I
6:18:34
just want to be 100% transparent with you. Let's see. Claude is coding that right here. Also got AI Studio going. We
6:18:42
can build something else out in the meantime via Klein. That cost us 13
6:18:48
cents to build out the Flappy Bird game. We'll go inside here again. We'll take another prompt from the AI success lab.
6:18:54
Link in the comments description. And we'll say build a rage clicker game with one giant button. Let's try that. All
6:19:02
right. So, this is the output from Google Gemini inside. It's just super basic and average, right? If you compare
6:19:09
that to the output from Claude Sonic 4, the outputs look way nicer. So, let's play this. You can see like the graphics
6:19:15
are nicer, the UI is nicer, it just feels a lot more fun to play. So, I don't know whether it's just because
6:19:21
it's in beta or something like that, but the new Gemini 2.5 Pro preview is not as
6:19:29
good as I would have hoped. Let's go back now. If we go over to AI Studio, still coding out the Rage
6:19:35
Clicker. Let's check out the Rage Clicker from Visual Studio Code. Here we go. It's
6:19:42
okay, right? That is okay, but it's not that impressive. If we actually take the same prompt again and we go back to
6:19:50
Sonnet and we'll see what comes back with. Let's hit enter on that. In the meantime, we'll let that load. But so
6:19:57
far, the Claude is superior no matter what the benchmarks tell me. I refuse to believe the benchmarks. AI
6:20:04
Studio is just going mad on the coding. And if we go back to the chat room
6:20:09
inside Open Rooster, let's see what we got here. Oh, it's being really buggy. Why
6:20:16
is it being so buggy? All right, let's copy that. Is that single HTML? Let's
6:20:21
try it out. Here we go. Hyperdopamine Pong. It's looking incredible, but it
6:20:27
does nothing when you click it. All right, let's have a look inside the chat room here. So, we did say single HTML
6:20:35
doesn't work, mate. Honestly, if you compare that versus the outputs of the normal Gemini, the previous version, I
6:20:41
would say the old version is actually better. So, for example, if we take exactly the same prompt that we used on
6:20:48
the new version, but we'll use it on the old version inside Gemini using Pro Preview. Let's see what we get back. In
6:20:55
the meantime, let's check out the Rage Clicker from Claude. So, this is the one from Gemini, the new version. Not that
6:21:02
interesting. If we have a look at the new version from Sonic. Ah, it's just 10 times better, isn't it? 10 times better.
6:21:10
Let's have a look. We got the Rage Clicker game being built out wide. The old version of Gemini as well. I don't
6:21:16
think the new version is inside here because it's not available for general availability yet. Yeah, this is better.
6:21:22
What are we even talking about here, peeps? It doesn't seem like an upgrade to me. Let's check out the final output.
6:21:28
So, we'll give it one last chance. But it's still going out. So it's it's been there for nearly nearly seven minutes
6:21:36
just coding this out. Right. So from what I can see overall, I'm not going to
6:21:41
say that Gemini the new version 2.5 Pro preview is the best. Being fully
6:21:46
transparent, it doesn't seem that good or interesting. Claude Sonic 4 seems to create better outputs. And also the
6:21:53
older version of Gemini inside 2.5 Pro Preview on Gemini seems to be better as
6:21:59
well. So, from what I've seen so far, Gemini 2.5 Pro preview 0605 is just not
6:22:06
as good. If you want all the video notes from today, all the prompts, etc., feel free to do that inside the AI success
6:22:12

6:22:55
watching. Deepseek versus Claude for Opus versus Chat GPT03
6:23:02
versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. who wins. Today, we're going to be testing them out side by side in an epic coding gauntlet
6:23:09
between these AI models, bearing in mind that Deep Seek have just released a brand new update called Deep Seek R1
6:23:17
0528. Literally just got announced. And today, we're going to be testing all of these models side by side to see who's
6:23:24
the winner, who's the best. You can get all of the prompts I use today from the AI Success Lab, link in the comments
6:23:29
description. And the first prompt that we're going to go with is building an AI powered SEO therapy chatbot. Let's get
6:23:36
straight into it. I'm going to run the prompt inside each of these. We're going to be using Claude Opus 4. And I'm going
6:23:42
to make sure that I have extended thinking switched on as well, just to get the most out of each of these models. We'll do the same inside
6:23:49
ChachiP3. And then we'll do the same inside Gemini. Of course, you want to make sure you have Canvas switched on with Gemini
6:23:56
2.5 Pro in the top right there as well. So let's see who comes back with the
6:24:02
best output. Open these up in separate windows just so you can see how fast each one moves as well and let the coding commence peeps. So what you can
6:24:09
see here is we've got Deepseek on the left, Claude for Opus over here, Chat GPT03 and then Gemini 2.5 Pro. Now what
6:24:16
you can see here is that each of these took a similar amount of
6:24:22
time to start coding out. I honestly think that it Oh, look at this. We got
6:24:27
Gemini. We just come up with the first output. So, let's see what we got back here.
6:24:33
Dr. Ser. Pretty basic app to be fair, but we'll
6:24:38
see how this performs
6:24:44
and actually responds to us straight away as well. So, we put hey, and this is working nicely and vent my
6:24:50
frustrations here. Okay, I got hit by the Google updates.
6:24:59
Is it going to reply to me? Actually does. Look at that. It's a It's a very expressive AI
6:25:07
therapist, to be fair. Oh, honey, those words carry so much pain. I hear you loud and clear. Blah, blah, blah. I'm
6:25:12
actually surprised this is responding to us. That's pretty crazy. Maybe that's built in or it's using the
6:25:18
AI to do that. I don't know how it's doing that. The UI of Gemini was not that great, but it created the output
6:25:24
and it created it pretty quickly as well. Now, I've got the output from Claude. If we move the cursor, it actually uses its eyes to follow us
6:25:31
around, like you can see. And then inside here, it says, "Tell me about your ranking losses. I'm here to listen." I say,
6:25:40
"I miss my SEO traffic." And it says, it actually came back to us and said, "I
6:25:46
hear you. Losing your top three positions, blah, blah, must be hard. I'm actually going to open that up in a
6:25:51
separate tab just to make it easier to view. And there we go. I say what to do,
6:25:58
but it doesn't really seem to give me answers that are like relevant to what I'm talking about. Does that make sense? So, for example, it says I said what to
6:26:05
do and it said it's completely normal to feel this way. Remember, you are more than your domain authority. You have intrinsic value beyond page rank. It's
6:26:12
quite a funny creative sort of response, but it actually doesn't answer our questions. whereas Gemini seem to
6:26:20
what would be interesting is actually if you could plug in an API key and then and then get outputs based on the AI
6:26:26
GPT3 has it come back to us. Yeah, it's come
6:26:31
back to us. All right, let's preview this bad boy. See what we got.
6:26:39
So GPT03 seems to have totally failed. You can see it says an error message right there. So the UI does not work at
6:26:47
all. So I'm going to place that behind Gemini and Claude. So far so far I would
6:26:53
say that Gemini is winning simply because it gave us the most relevant responses when we asked it questions.
6:27:01
And then Deep Seek one.
6:27:08
It's giving us an output, but it's in Python. I'm going say turn
6:27:13
that into HTML and see what we get back in a sec. History by says Gemini 2.5 Pro
6:27:19
is better at coding but worse at other things. Every model has their weaknesses, right? So, for example, if
6:27:24
you want to generate an article or a blog, honestly, I don't even need to check all these. I would say that Claude Forson Sonic creates the best outputs by
6:27:31
far. Gemini is really good at coding,
6:27:36
but it's not the best model out there to be honest with you. Just waiting for this to come back from deepseek.
6:27:42
It's holding us back here. Slowing us down. I'll put on the next prompt to use HTML instead.
6:27:51
Gemini chat GPT03 is almost guaranteed to come in last
6:27:56
here unless Deep Seek gives us something really bad. In the meantime, we'll come
6:28:02
back to Deepseek whilst it's generating that because it might take a little while
6:28:07
and we'll move on to the next task, which is
6:28:13
build a schema shogun puzzle game. You're a samurai cutting, placing structured data into HTML scrolls, match
6:28:20
FAQs, blah blah blah. And we'll turn that into a game as well. All right, so
6:28:25
let's wait for Deep Sea R1 to load. It's actually taking absolutely ages to load
6:28:31
the page right here. So, what I might do is just go over to open router instead.
6:28:37
All right. So, we're going to run this inside DeepSeek and then we'll compare it against the rest as well.
6:28:47
Let's go inside Opus here. We chat GPT 03 ready to go. And then
6:28:54
Gemini as well. Gemini 2.5 Pro. Again, I think on all of these, from what I've
6:29:00
seen, Deep Seek is by far the slowest. Now, we
6:29:06
can actually run this. So, let's click on run. See what we get back.
6:29:13
I said before we begin, what's your domain name? We'll go with Okay.
6:29:23
And then we've got the chatbot ready here. Okay, the UI is actually better than Gemini 2.5 Pros, which is awesome.
6:29:34
And if we go inside, okay, we'll do a little chat here. It's
6:29:39
writing back to us, how you feeling about your SERs. I'm going to say terrible.
6:29:48
And then it sends the same message again. All right. So, if I had to give
6:29:55
Let's see if this We'll give it one final shot. Absolutely terrible. Say
6:30:00
Sunshine. Oh, it's just bro. It's a broken record,
6:30:06
mate. You'd give up on that therapist quickly. How are you feeling about your ser today? It's asked us that three
6:30:12
times. The UI is great, but the actual back end terrible. So,
6:30:17
if I had to grade each one of these, I'm going to go with Gemini 2.5 Pro as a
6:30:22
winner. Claude for Opus coming in second, Deepseek coming in third. UI was
6:30:28
great, but the functionality was terrible. And then finally, the final one I would say is chat cheapy 03.
6:30:36
Didn't create anything. Now bear in mind, Deepseek is free and you can even code with it for free with the free API
6:30:42
of open router. Whereas, for example, chat GPT03 is paid and it's it can be
6:30:47
pretty expensive, I think, on the API as well. So, we're going to close that. We know who the winners are and we're
6:30:53
waiting for each of these to load on the next task. So, we have the output again.
6:30:58
Gemini and then Claude coming in terms of speed. So, these are the fastest models by far. And then we've got schema
6:31:06
shogun slice the data into the correct thing.
6:31:13
But it doesn't really seem to do anything. Doesn't make any sense. All right, let's
6:31:19
close that. I'm going to say inside Claude just to get a better output. I'll do the same inside Gemini as well. Let's
6:31:25
just say make this a 3JS
6:31:31
Samurai runner game. We'll do the same inside Gemini. So, same prompt inside
6:31:37
Gemini and Claude. We have the output back from chat GBT3.
6:31:43
Let's preview that. There we go. That's working nicely to be fair. I'm just going to say okay, make this like a
6:31:49
freejs runner game on that too. And then Deep Seek is
6:31:56
still it's coding out now.
6:32:04
Just going to stop it. And then I'm going to say the same thing inside here. We'll wait for each of these to load.
6:32:12
So Gemini actually has an error on this. We'll try and get that fixed. And then
6:32:18
chat GB03 says stop the HTML. And then run it again. It's got a bug. So we'll try and fix that. And back in a sec,
6:32:25
peeps. Here we go. So we got Gemini ready to go. Let's play this bad boy.
6:32:32
It's got sound effects. There we go.
6:32:40
Oh, no. It's not much of a samurai though. That's what I don't like.
6:32:51
Claude is stuck. Doesn't seem to be doing anything. Chat GBT is not working.
6:32:57
Deep Seek is still coding away. Here we are. All right. Right. So, we got Opus 4 ready to go. We got a little
6:33:05
samurai stickman.
6:33:11
Just collecting honor.
6:33:17
That's probably the best output so far to be fair. So, chat cheap 3 just
6:33:22
doesn't seem to be working at all. I'm just going to preview that once more. Yeah, it's not working.
6:33:28
And we got the HTML back from Deepseek. Let's test this out. Begin the journey.
6:33:39
Ah, okay.
6:33:46
I'm not really sure what's going on there. Well, that's the most playable to be fair. Gemini,
6:33:53
it's too basic. I'm sure if you go back and forth inside the chat here, you could create something interesting. But Claude is winning.
6:34:02
by far. To be fair, that's an actual playable game. Again, like you could go back and forth with the details a lot
6:34:08
more if we had more time, but just as a quick preview, I'm going to say that Claude
6:34:14
won here. So, if I was to choose any of these, I've got to go with Claude. Now, let's create something a bit more basic
6:34:21
just to give each a chance. So, we're going to go back to Claude
6:34:27
Deepseek in Gemini N3. And by the way, if you
6:34:33
want the prompts from today, feel free to get them inside the AI success lab. I'm going to run this prompt for
6:34:39
Dopamine Space Invaders. So, I think at this point, just to recap here, let's
6:34:44
turn that off. It should be on 03. So just to recap here,
6:34:50
if I had to pick one so far, Gemini I would say is probably performing the best. Deepseek is creating good stuff as
6:34:56
well. Claude as well is up there, but Chat GPT
6:35:02
is not even in the race at this point. So Chat GPT 03 finished first here. Let's test this out.
6:35:09
Here we go. So Space Fires. Here we go. That's a pretty
6:35:15
nice game to be fair. Nice effects. I like the background of all the stars and everything like that. It's looking
6:35:22
pretty cool.
6:35:29
Gemini looks just about finished. Deep Seek still coding. And we got
6:35:34
Claude ready to go as well here. Claude, you
6:35:39
can actually control the game with your your mouse. it looks like.
6:35:49
And here's a shoot button. I would say that's still better than, for example,
6:35:55
GPT3. If you look at the effects, the screen moving, the colors, the way you can
6:36:01
control the mouse, the feel, etc., it's still better than 03, but 03 did okay.
6:36:08
Let's have a look at Gemini now. So, Gemini is finished. This is looking pretty nice. Nice. I like the retro feel. It's got sound effects as well.
6:36:15
That's what we're talking about. Oh, yeah. Gemini is winning. You old Rogue is crushing it. All right,
6:36:24
let's try Deep Seek. Deep Seek is still taking his time. I think so far from the
6:36:29
tests, I would say though that that Claude Opus has created the best outputs each time, right? It's a close tie
6:36:36
between Gemini 2.5 Pro and Opus,
6:36:41
but I just think Opus is overpowered in terms of what it can create, the functionality, etc. It's pretty awesome.
6:36:50
So, we got the results back from Deepseek. Let's play this.
6:36:58
Ah, it's lagging. It's not bad, but it's lagging.
6:37:04
Yeah. So, I think that's pretty conclusive then. So, for example,
6:37:10
Claude Opus would be my pick from all of these. And I know some people are going to hate me for that in the comments and
6:37:16
say that that Gemini is a GOAT, but yeah, I'm going to go with Opus, then
6:37:21
Gemini. Deep Seek comes in a solid third, right? It's definitely better than Chepy O3 from what I've seen. And
6:37:27
03, it really only worked on the last test. It didn't work on the rest. So, thanks so much for watching. If you want
6:37:32
to get access to all the notes from today, all the prompts, etc., feel free to get that inside the AI profit
6:37:38
boardroom. This also comes with courses on deepseek. You can see the links here.

feel free to get that inside the AI profit boardroom. You can also ask any questions you have inside there. I'm
6:38:19
very active inside this community. Comes with lots of templates, agents, workflows, all the stuff that I've
6:38:25
actually implemented inside my business. It's fun creating games, but let's talk about what's actually going to make you money and save you time. That stuff is
6:38:31
all included inside the classroom. And then it also comes with weekly coaching calls, plus a Q&A as well. And on top of
6:38:37
that, each week I make a personalized video answering everyone's question. Now, if you just want us to implement
6:38:44
all this stuff for you, maybe you want to save a lot of time, you want someone to go off an agency to just build
6:38:49
automations for you, feel free to get a free AI automation strategy session.
6:38:54
Link in the comments description. You can book in a free AI strategy session and then just book in a call with us and
6:39:00
we'll be happy to help you and basically just plan out step by step what you can automate, how you can automate it and
6:39:07
then the next steps for doing that. So feel free to get that link in the comments description. Appreciate you watching. Deepseek R1 0528 versus Claude
6:39:15
4 versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. I just ran China's new version of Deep Sea Garwan
6:39:21
against Claude 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro and the results have shocked me. This is a
6:39:26
brutal AI coding battle and what happened next is going to be very interesting. I'm about to show you which
6:39:32
AI destroys the competition when building real applications and the results are not what you'd expect.
6:39:38
You'll learn the exact prompts I use to push each AI to its limit and see which one provides the most professionalgrade
6:39:45
code that actually works. and you'll discover which AI model wins the most intense AI coding gauntlet I've ever
6:39:52
created. Deepseek R1052A versus Clawude 4 versus Gemini 2.5 Pro.
6:39:59
Who wins? Today we're going to be testing them out side by side and just seeing which one creates the best
6:40:05
possible output. So, if you want to start using the new update from Deep Seek 1, you can go to open router, then
6:40:10
go to the chat. Make sure that you have selected free if you want to use a free version. I'm actually going to use the
6:40:16
paid version just in case the free version lets me down today. And then you can see that we can enable web search or
6:40:22
anything like that as well if we want to. But we'll go with that for now. In the meantime, what we're also going to do is we're going to run Claude 4 with
6:40:29
exactly the same prompt side by side. And not just that, we'll also be testing
6:40:35
out Gemini 2.5 Pro and just putting each of them to a battle, a coding battle,
6:40:42
and seeing which one gives us the best results. And by the way, if you want to get all of my resources on Deep Seek
6:40:49
one, the update, how to access it, what it means, etc. Plus, all of my new SAPs and updates on AI, feel free to get that
6:40:57
inside the AI success lab. It's community of 8,000 people, and you can join it. Link in the comments description. All right. So, we're going
6:41:03
to get straight into this and start running some prompts on this bad boy and seeing which one performs the best. So,
6:41:09
what we're going to do from here is we're going to make sure that we have
6:41:14
Claude Opus selected. So, we're going to use Opus 4 like you can see. Then, we're
6:41:20
going to use Deepc 1 and we've got Gemini 2.5 Pro ready to go over here. Now, I'm just going to select canvas as
6:41:26
well so we can preview directly inside the chat. for Deep Sea Car 1ut. If we run some code, we'll have to use
6:41:32
liveweave.com to preview it. And let's just get this bad boy started. Let's get this AI party started. All right. So,
6:41:39
I'm going to run this prompt side by side on each model and see what we get back. If you want all the prompts from
6:41:46
today, it's inside the AI success lab. Just go down to the classroom and then you'll find them inside the classroom.
6:41:52
There we can compare them side by side and which one performs the best. Now, speaking 100% honestly, I have a feeling
6:42:01
that Gemini 2.5 Pro or Claude 4 are going to be overpowered for this. But at the same time, when I've tested out Deep
6:42:08
Seek R1 0528 today, I was so impressed. It was so powerful that I thought maybe
6:42:14
we could actually compare them side by side and R1 can give them a good run for their money. Now bear in mind as well DC
6:42:20
car one if you're using the free version on open router number one it's open source but number two you can get access for free and so it's very interesting to
6:42:29
compare these models you can use Gemini 2.5 pro but there are limits and claude
6:42:34
obviously has limits as well so it'll be interesting to see okay which one performs the best and how they perform
6:42:41
side by side now we can see them all coding here and it'll be interesting to see which
6:42:47
one finishes first.
6:42:53
So, it looks like Claude Opus finished first as you can see. [Music]
6:42:59
Let's pull this up full screen and see what we got back here. So, what we asked
6:43:04
for was a drums visual, right? A dopam bean drums visual, a circular drum machine interface. Tap to beat blah blah
6:43:11
blah. Let's see what we got.
6:43:17
That is just incredible, isn't it? And then we got a little progress bar at the bottom, I think. Let's play that.
6:43:25
All right, so now we've also got the response back from Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, one thing to note here is already Deep
6:43:31
Seek 1 is a lot slower than the other two.
6:43:40
But here's what I would say is the Gemini 2.5 Pro actually failed. So, it didn't create anything. and there's an
6:43:46
error. So, we can click on fix error like but just one thing to bear in mind there is actually Gemini 2.5 Pro failed
6:43:53
on that test. So, it's going to be interesting to see how Deep Seek R1
6:43:58
performs and what it comes back with. In the meantime, I can just ask Opus to level this up a little bit. And also,
6:44:04
what I'm going to do with Opus is I'm going to select extended thinking inside
6:44:10
the options here just to make it even more overpowered. So, if we save the opus, improve the UI, make it more
6:44:16
interesting, plus fun and enjoyable, plus crank up
6:44:23
the dopamine levels. We'll wait for that to code out. Yeah,
6:44:29
Deep Sea Guy One is super slow on these tests. What I'm actually going to have to do, I think, is run
6:44:37
multiple tests at the same time with DeepC on because you can see how slow it is and how much time it's taking to get
6:44:44
back to us. So, in the meantime, what I've actually done is run another test in the background and this is for a
6:44:50
flashing keyword game. So, let's see what we got back from DeepCar 1. See how it performed, etc. It is quite a lot of
6:44:56
code to be fair.
6:45:02
So, we're going to take the code from the second test.
6:45:10
Copy that and we'll preview it. This is pretty cool though. So, this is another one that Deep Seek one just one shoted
6:45:17
like you can see. So, if we spin that to win. Pretty cool. We can
6:45:23
zoom out a bit here as well.
6:45:30
There we go. All right. Now, let's run that same test inside Claude and Gemini.
6:45:39
Claude for Opus. It's just It's a go, isn't it? Right now. Look at that.
6:45:47
So, you got different drum sounds there. It worked perfectly both times we tested it, and that was pretty easy and simple
6:45:52
to do. So, we're going to X off that and then we'll start a new chat over here and we'll go on to the second test which
6:45:59
Deep Sea Car 2 has already created an output for, but we'll test it on Opus as well. And then Gemini, let's see what we
6:46:07
got back. It's total trash. Total trash. So, Gemini actually failed the first test. It gave us nothing.
6:46:16
and Deep Sea Car 2 is that Deep Sea Car 1 0528 actually gave us an error and
6:46:22
doesn't seem to have finished the code as you can see. Now, I'm 99% sure I got charged for that. If I have a look at my
6:46:28
credits, even though there was an error. So, let's see what we got in the credits. See if we got charged for that.
6:46:35
Yeah, look at that. Got charged for using nothing. Okay, thank you. All
6:46:41
right. So,
6:46:47
Deep Sea Car 1 failed the first test. Gemini 2.5 Pro failed the first test.
6:46:52
Let's see how Gemini and Claude perform on the second test. Claude obviously won
6:46:58
the first round. AI store on Twitter says, "Is actually one shot useless?"
6:47:06
So far is like on the second test. Deep sea car one 05 to8 worked really well,
6:47:11
but on the first test, yeah, I would agree. Like the one shot totally timed out on us and didn't work at all. It's
6:47:17
just a little bit too slow. Deep sea go R105 to8. That's what I would say about it. So, what we can do with another one
6:47:25
is we're going to say build a SER racing game where we fly through
6:47:30
in different examples. So if we go inside here,
6:47:37
close that. We're going to run this on DeepSeek R10528. So build a SER racing
6:47:43
game where you fly a rocket powered blog post through AI spam sites, collect schema fuel, blah blah blah. And we'll
6:47:49
wait for that to code out. All right. Now, if we have a look at Claude Opus in
6:47:54
its output, this looks pretty cool. So here we go. Let's spin it to win it.
6:48:05
So powerful. It was so powerful I couldn't even handle it.
6:48:15
Yeah, it's pretty. To be fair, Deep Seeks was okay, but if you compare them side by side, let's try these out. So,
6:48:21
this is Deep Sea Car 2.
6:48:27
Sorry, Deep Sea Car 10528. And this is Claude Opus. Claude Opus wins. Gemini
6:48:33
2.5 Pro. Where are we up to, mate? All right, we got the code here. Let's see
6:48:38
on live what we got. Plug that in. It's not bad, but I don't
6:48:45
like the UI. Do not like the UI. You can see the words and everything overlapping
6:48:51
right there. Let's run this in canvas. I say now run it in canvas.
6:48:58
But yeah, I would say overall in the tests, we compare them side by side. So again, Claude Opus won by a long way.
6:49:05
Like the flashing headlines, the UI, the sound effects, the UI is super nice. The
6:49:12
design is good. Great front end and back end right there.
6:49:18
Deepseek R10528 competed. It was definitely in the race. didn't create something as nice as
6:49:25
Claude for Opus, but for a free option, not bad at all. And then Gemini 2.5 Pro,
6:49:31
as much as I love it, came in last right there. Exactly the same prompt, but the UI is just not as nice. We can wait for
6:49:37
the second version on canvas. Was a one shot. I'm going to say that Claude, Deepseek, and then Gemini 2.5 Pro. Bear
6:49:44
in mind, Gemini failed the first test. So did Deep Seek and Claude Opus 4 has
6:49:50
come out on top for both methods. Right. So if we go on here, we'll have a cheeky
6:49:57
go on this. Yeah. So you can see how the text is
6:50:02
just overlapping. That doesn't look very nice. We click on spin. There's no sound effects either.
6:50:09
Yeah. Is is average. I think Opus wins by a long way right there. So let's see
6:50:14
what we got back on the next test. And over here, we're going to go inside called Opus again.
6:50:22
New chat, build a racing game.
6:50:29
Do the same inside Gemini 2.5 Pro. Just make sure if you're doing these tests, like you want to be running on canvas. I
6:50:35
always forget to click it. It should be on default, I think. But yeah, there we go. And then Deep Sea Car1, it's the
6:50:41
slowest model by a long way. Just realize that is super slow. I think that honestly Claude for Opus will probably
6:50:49
create its output faster than deep sea car 1 even though we got gave deep car one the input like 5 minutes ago. Now
6:50:57
some people ask like why do I use liveweave? I always use liveweave for for pre previewing like raw HTML right
6:51:03
so if you have raw HTML I use liveweave unless there's a canvas option. So for example, Gemini and Claude, they both
6:51:11
have canvas options and so you can easily preview the code that you create directly in there. But if you're using
6:51:16
open router in open router, it doesn't have a canvas option as far as I'm aware. And so you have to run the code
6:51:23
through live weave to test it first. So we got the output back from R2, sorry,
6:51:29
R1 05 to8 and we have the output back from Gemini 2.5 Pro. Let's give Gemini
6:51:36
2.5 Pro a chance first.
6:51:47
I still don't like the UI. I don't know what's going on here, but whether Opus is making it look bad,
6:51:55
but the UI is super boring on Gemini 2.5 Pro.
6:52:03
But not bad. It actually worked. So, that's okay. Now, let's have a look at Claude's output. So, this is
6:52:11
Claude's SEO race game. We'll plug this in. See what we got. Isn't that way more fun than Gemini? Look at that bad boy.
6:52:18
You're having the time of your life playing that. It's so trippy. It looks cool, though.
6:52:28
Yeah, I like that. I like that. That's cool. That's cool. All right. Now, let's test out on DeepSeek R1 as well. Grab
6:52:36
that code. Plug it into LiveWave. And there we go.
6:52:43
All right.
6:52:49
Here we go. Well, I don't seem to be able to go. Oh, there we go. All right. All right. All right. Top block. It's a
6:52:57
weird one. Like, the UI is super weird, but it's fun. If I had to compare them side by side,
6:53:03
right? So for sure, undeniably,
6:53:11
Claude Opus 4 absolutely smashed it. Absolutely smashed it. It wasn't even
6:53:17
close. Claude for Opus won the race. Right.
6:53:23
Then if I had to compare the other two, I'm going to go with Deep Sea Car1 just because I think it's a bit more
6:53:28
interesting. in this UI feels like a Mega Drive game.
6:53:34
Let's refresh that.
6:53:40
It's a bit more interesting. It's a bit more fun, etc. Yeah, I'm going to go with Deep Sea Garan. Coming in second
6:53:47
right there. So, just to recap, test number one, the game only Clawude for
6:53:52
Opus could do it. Test number two, the the wheel.
6:53:58
Gemini kind of failed a little bit like it was creating something really buggy. Deepse car one came in second, created
6:54:06
something okay, but Claude Fopus again smashed it. And then on the last round, Gemini created like a really boring
6:54:12
game. Deepc1 created a game that was okay. But again, Claude Opus just
6:54:18
crashed it. And I don't think anyone can compete with it to be honest with you. Like I think Claude Opus is miles ahead
6:54:23
of everyone. So that's basically the final outputs from what we've seen. You've seen the tests, you've seen the
6:54:29
game, you've seen what you can create with AI now. And for oneshots, Claude for Opus is absolutely the goat even
6:54:36
compared to the latest update from Deep Sea Car1 and everything else. So thanks so much for watching. If you want to get

thing knowing what the updates are and how you know you can get access to them. It's another thing understanding, okay,
6:55:47
how can that save you time? How can you start implementing that today, right? And that's what the AI profit boardroom is all about. So, feel free to get that
6:55:53
stuff link in the comments description. I appreciate you watching. Claude for Sonnet versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. Who wins?
6:56:00
Today, we'll find out which AI truly dominates. and we're about to settle the
6:56:06
ultimate AI showdown and basically test them side by side and see what we can create. And what you're
6:56:12
about to see may shock you cuz some of the stuff you can build with this is just absolutely amazing. So, let's get
6:56:18
straight into it and I'm going to show you what we can build. We're going to test these side by side and we're specifically testing Claude for Sonnet
6:56:26
versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, let's get into it. All right. Now, if you want to build with Gemini 2.5 Pro for free, you
6:56:33
can use AI Studio. And then if you want to build with Claude for Sonet for free, then let me show you exactly how to do
6:56:40
that in a second as well. And we'll pull these up side by side.
6:56:47
Now, I've got a bunch of awesome prompts as well that we're going to be testing. Actually, I'm genuinely interested to
6:56:53
see what we get back from this. It's going to be pretty wild, I think. So, let's get straight into this. And by the
6:57:01
way, if you want all the prompts are inside the AI profit bordering. So, we're going to test these side by side.
6:57:07
One thing I'm going to allow inside Claude is extended thinking just to get better responses from Claude for Sonnet.
6:57:14
The first thing that we're going to go with inside both of these is this keyword game. Now, I just need to make
6:57:20
sure as well that I've got Gemini 2.5 Pro selected, which I have. Awesome stuff. I'm just going to change that to
6:57:26
the latest version. So, make sure you're not using the 6th of May version. Use Oh, actually that's flash preview. Yeah,
6:57:32
let's just go with 6 for May then. And then we'll pull these up side by side. All right. If you want all these prompts
6:57:38
are inside the AI profit boardroom, you can just run them through chat GBT and say customize them to my niche or whatever you want. Right. So, for
6:57:44
example, we're going to say build a keyword rain game. Let's plug them in. See what we get back. And then we can
6:57:49
preview the HTML later. Now, we could also use Gemini. And it'd be interesting
6:57:54
to know whether you get better responses inside Gemini or inside AI Studio. Obviously, Gemini is paid. I'm on the
6:58:04
advanced model, but if you want to use it for free, you can use it inside AI Studio. So,
6:58:10
let's roll with this. Actually, I just need to allow the
6:58:16
canvas. There we go. You can see claw force on it is already coding away. And
6:58:21
if you're wondering, okay, what's the prompt? So we said build a keyword rain game where juicy SEO keywords fall from
6:58:26
the sky and rainbow fonts. You swipe only the gold ones. Every correct swipe trigger flashes slot machine sounds and
6:58:32
firework combos. Miss one screen shake single HTML. Right. So the other thing
6:58:37
we're looking for here is speed and also whether it can oneot. Right.
6:58:45
So Gemini 2.5 Pro is still building out. Let's see what we get back in a sec. So,
6:58:52
we got the output from AI Studio. The way that I'm going to preview this is if we go to liveweave,
6:58:59
we can just plug that in. All right, let's plug that in over here. Here we go. Keyword rain SEO.
6:59:06
Let's start the game. See what we get. It's okay. Pretty average to be honest with you. Let's have a look at
6:59:14
Gemini's output. What we got here? Very similar to be fair, but that's a
6:59:20
bit more to be fair. It looks better inside Gemini than it does AI Studio. So AI Studio and Gemini are both using 2.5
6:59:27
Pro to build stuff out, but you can see how it doesn't work now actually, which is weird.
6:59:32
So you see how it's not generating anything else there.
6:59:39
Let's see what Claude for Sonnet builds out. By the way, just whilst we're waiting for that to generate on Claude
6:59:45
for Sonnet, if you want to see some other examples of stuff I built, check this out. This was built this morning.
6:59:50
Pretty
6:59:55
cool, right? Like that gets the dopamine going. It's pretty crazy. Now, anyway, we're going
7:00:01
to close that. Close that. Let's get back to Clawude for Sonic. See what we got here. It's incredible.
7:00:09
Only the gold keywords. All right, let's go with the gold ones.
7:00:18
There we go. It's a pretty easy game, but you get the point.
7:00:25
There we go. All right. Good stuff. So, I would say out of all of them, honestly, Claude 4 Sonic won that by a
7:00:32
long way. I didn't think the output from AI was that great. Gemini actually just
7:00:38
stopped working after the first round, but Claude 4 actually worked and it had all the sound effects and everything else. So, let's move on to the next one
7:00:45
now, which is the backlink blaster. By the way, some people in the comments they say like build something out that I
7:00:51
would actually use or whatever. All what you can do with these prompts is like you can run them through chat cheap and
7:00:56
say just customize to my to my niche, right? So any ideas that you see in these videos, you can just build them
7:01:02
out to whatever niche you're in. Doesn't matter. So we're building out each of these.
7:01:10
Let's see what we got. We already got the code from Gemini 2.5 Pro coming out, which is good. There we go. So, we got
7:01:16
Gemini 2.5 in the middle. One thing I just need to do is just um generate that
7:01:23
with canvas. Always remember to generate on canvas because it doesn't come up on default. Claw 4 has come back to us.
7:01:34
Let's test this out. Not that great to be honest. That wasn't a great game.
7:01:40
Let's see what we got back from AI Studio. I like the ones with the sound effects and the neon lights. So, this is
7:01:47
the output from AI Studio. Let's see what we get back here. Not the best game
7:01:54
there. Let's see what we got back from uh from Gemini.
7:02:01
Yeah, I'm going to go with that one. That is pretty insane.
7:02:08
It's broken, but I liked it. I liked it. That one was the most entertaining.
7:02:13
I wouldn't say any of them were particularly interesting to be honest, but that one was probably the best. So,
7:02:19
I would say Gemini 2.5 Pro won that one. It's the most interesting.
7:02:26
This one, not so great. The one from AI Studio, not so great, but yeah, you get
7:02:32
the point. All right, so let's take the next one. Now, we're going to say build a Google algorithm boss fight.
7:02:41
Let's plug this in. Say just going to to make it more interesting. Say neon
7:02:47
lights to trigger dopamine plus include sound effects.
7:02:54
That's what we're all about these days. All right. The other day I was watching my videos and I was like,
7:03:02
back in the day I used to talk about backlinks and all that stuff. And that's I mean that's still what we sell as an
7:03:07
agency, but I never thought I'd be in a position where I'm just coding out games in one
7:03:12
click with AI on a live stream. Like it's a very weird sort of progression.
7:03:18
So anyway, let's keep playing these out, seeing what we get back. Who's going to
7:03:24
win here? That's the question in terms of speed. I think it might be
7:03:31
AI Studio, you know.
7:03:38
Oh, it's clawed force on it. Let's see what we got back here.
7:03:43
[Music]
7:03:48
It doesn't make any sense. That does not make any sense. Right. And what I'm going to do inside claw force
7:03:54
on it is just say
7:04:05
we'll take a screenshot here and say inside here
7:04:12
make sure the game is more interesting than this black screen.
7:04:21
There should be characters plus it should feel like a 3JS game. And
7:04:27
we'll just recode that and see what we get back in a second. So now we've got the code back from
7:04:34
Gemini. Let's pull this one up. See what we got. That's horrible. Those sound effects are
7:04:40
horrible. I mean, it's it's winning so far just
7:04:46
because I actually created something that worked. I don't even know what this is. But we'll run with it. We'll run with
7:04:52
it. One thing I would say here is probably the the prompt is a bit too complex for the AI and so it doesn't
7:04:58
really know how to build it or what to build out. So that's something that I personally could improve. So let's go
7:05:04
back on to LiveWeave now. We'll take the output from AI Studio. It's kind of like
7:05:10
a turnbased game, but it doesn't make much sense. So, I mean, in terms of who's winning here,
7:05:16
I'm going to say that
7:05:22
the AI Studio came in second. Gemini came in first. Claude Force on it didn't really build
7:05:28
anything out that was useful,
7:05:34
but maybe we'll get something better back in a sec. All right,
7:05:39
let's see what else we can build here. Oh, here we go. So, we got the second output from Claude for Sonic.
7:05:46
Why is it Why is it just got that inside the the top left?
7:05:54
Doesn't make any sense. All right, Claude Forson just got totally confused there. Probably my bad prompt, but
7:05:59
still, you can see how it worked on AI Studio and and Gemini as well.
7:06:06
Next up, let's keep going now. So, what we're going to say is build a SER racing
7:06:12
game. So, let's plug that in. We'll go with Gemini as well.
7:06:19
And just to be clear here, so Gemini has won two out of three of the battles.
7:06:24
Claude 4 is coming in second to Gemini 2.5 Pro. But we'll keep going. We'll
7:06:29
keep testing for you and seeing what we get back in a sec. Here we go. Clone
7:06:34
force on it seems to be the fastest honestly from what I can see. So, let's see what we got here. That's working
7:06:40
beautifully. Let's just unmute this as well because it does have sound effects.
7:06:46
Do you know what? I'm going to publish that one and then we'll give it a cheeky go. I
7:06:52
mean, the fact that you can just build this out in a minute is just absolutely wild for the quality. How long would it
7:06:59
take a coder to build this stuff out, right? So, let's go on this. See what we got here. So, we're flying a blog post.
7:07:07
We want to get back links. I mean, it actually makes sense as a
7:07:12
game to be fair. We're increasing the speed. Oh, yes. Absolutely nailing it. Oh, no, no, no.
7:07:18
We crashed into the S void. That's pretty cool. I mean, we can.
7:07:25
[Music] Not bad at all, lad. Not bad at all. All
7:07:30
right. Now, let's see what we got back from AI Studio.
7:07:37
That looks to be getting a bit confused. Sometimes it does this AI Studio with sound effects. So, you see how it's just
7:07:42
creating loads of code. I reckon it's going to break, but we'll
7:07:47
see in a sec. And then we got Gemini still building this out. That should be ready to preview in a sec.
7:07:56
Here we go.
7:08:01
Pilot your blongf through the treacherous ser. Collect fuel boost and nitro. Avoid AI spam and 404 asteroids.
7:08:08
Okay, let's go. There's nothing on screen, mate.
7:08:18
Yeah, there's nothing going on there. Nothing to dodge.
7:08:26
And AI Studio is still going hard in the paint on ones and zeros over here. Look
7:08:32
at that. All right. So, so far, I mean, I would
7:08:37
say Claude Forson Sonic is has won that round. And also, the difference here is that Claude for Sonic created a
7:08:43
perfectly working game that actually makes sense. It didn't get stuck on the code like
7:08:49
this one. And the game was a lot more fun than the other two. So, it's winning
7:08:55
on all rounds. All right. So, it's two all so far. Let's see what else we're going to create. Now,
7:09:06
I'm just going to stop AI Studio cuz it's been stuck for 207 seconds.
7:09:16
So, let's go with the final round. We're going on canvas.
7:09:26
And then we're going to run this through Claude for Sonic. To be honest, Claude for Sonnet will probably finish before both of them even though we've given
7:09:33
both of them the head start. But let's see what we get back.
7:09:42
And if you're wondering, okay, why am I using sonet instead of other methods? So the reason I'm using sonet is like a lot
7:09:48
of people asking for it in the comments yesterday. So, I was like, "Right, let's create this, right? Let's test them out." Opus is really powerful, too.
7:09:57
But, yeah, I just want to test out Sonic. I think Sonet might be well, it's definitely cheaper if you're using the API as well. So, that's a big
7:10:03
difference, too. You might be wondering, okay, like what
7:10:10
other AI tools do I use? So, I actually have inside the AI profit boardroom a list of all my favorite tools, right?
7:10:16
So, if you want to learn, you know, what tools am I using inside my business, what are my top three, etc., Feel free to join the AI profit boardroom link in
7:10:23
the comments description. You can learn how to build this stuff out yourself and also what we use and what's working right now. So again, Claw for Sonic is
7:10:30
has created something straight off the bat. Let's see what we got here.
7:10:39
Oh yeah, it's just incredible. It's SEO Space Invaders.
7:10:45
I think to be honest, we could make that even more interesting, which I might do in a second, but
7:10:51
it's pretty cool. All right, here's what I'm going to say.
7:10:56
Make the screen crazier with more animations, music,
7:11:05
flashing colors, and overall craziness.
7:11:16
plus made the screen shake. There we go. All right, because Claude 4 is so fast,
7:11:22
like we can probably code two versions before the other two are ready. So, Gemini is still coding back here in
7:11:32
the code back from AI Studio. You might be wondering like, do you need the
7:11:37
premium version of Claude as well? I would just try the free version and see if it works for you. If it works for you, then you can upgrade cuz you're
7:11:44
like, "Right, I need bigger limits and that sort of thing." So, this is the output from AI Studio. Let's start
7:11:50
playing this now. It's not bad.
7:11:56
Yeah, it's quite fun. It's quite fun. I wouldn't say it's as good as Claw for Sonics, but not bad at all.
7:12:06
Now, we've got Geminis over here. So, let's see what we get back. I can't see the main character at the bottom,
7:12:16
but not bad. Not bad. I'm still going to go with Claude for Sonet. I think it was way more interesting.
7:12:22
So, out of the five rounds, Claude for Sonnet won three rounds. Gemini 2.5
7:12:29
won two rounds. 2.5 Pro. Right.
7:12:35
Someone asked like, "What's the heart about as well?" I'm not even sure myself to be honest with you
7:12:42
on this one, right? Maybe that's like your health score or something like you have to protect it.
7:12:49
But yeah, that's what I mean. Like it doesn't quite add up. It doesn't quite make sense. So now we got the Clawude
7:12:54
Force Sonic output. Let's check this out.
7:13:00
Okay, this this went mad.
7:13:08
Look at that.
7:13:13
All right. All right. I'm just going to close that down.
7:13:19
Let's close that down. So, Claude for Sonic 1 by a long way. That was pretty crazy stuff. Um, yeah. If you want to
7:13:26
get all the prompts from today, plus tons of courses on Claude 4, how to use Gemini 2.5 Pro, etc., Feel free to get
7:13:32
that inside the AR profit boardroom. Comes with all the examples I've shown you today and also all of the prompts plus much more. And you can get that
7:13:39
inside the AI profit boardroom. Sorry, the AI success lab completely for free, right? All this stuff is free. And if
7:13:45
you want to get help, support, if you want to connect with me, if you want to be able to DM me and get advice, etc.,
7:13:50
feel free to get that inside the AI profit boardroom. This also comes with like weekly coaching calls, all my best
7:13:56
automations. If you want to know, okay, what AI tools are working right now, feel free to get all the information
7:14:01
inside the AI profit boardroom. The main thing here as well is like the community is just a million times better inside
7:14:06
the AI profit boardroom, right? So, if you need help, support, coaching, if you need advice, if you have questions, this
7:14:11
is the place to go, right? And you can post in here, introduce yourself, and also it's just about having fun, right? I know a lot of people who join this
7:14:18
because they were in an area where they can't connect with people doing the same things, right? And so, this is one of
7:14:23
the best places to go. So feel free to get that link in the comments description to the AI profit board. You've seen all the madness. We've seen
7:14:29
that Claude Force Sonnet wins today. Very tight battle. Both of them created like really cool stuff, but Claude Force
7:14:35
on it is the GOAT right now. And you can use Claw Force on it as well for free. So pretty cool stuff. This Google Gemini
7:14:44
2.5 Pro workflow with Veo 3 is insane. Let's play it. This is a movie I just created in a few clicks. Let's get into
7:14:51
it. If you think you're just made by a prompt, you're crazy. Just saying. Are you AI?
7:14:57
Are you crazy? Or are you good? You see that? Are you crazy?
7:15:02
I ain't AI. I'm the real thing. You can look into my eyes.
7:15:08
If you vote for me, I will ban prompt theory.
7:15:13
There are people who think that all of this is just made by prompts, and they are crazy.
7:15:19
Show me the meaning. [Music] If you're a prompt, then why can't your
7:15:25
prompts save you now? I just I feel like everything is just ones,
7:15:32
zeros. We are not just one and zero.
7:15:39
I would never date a man who believes in promp theory. I will ban prompt theory if you vote for
7:15:45
me. If you think you're AI, then why do you have feelings and emotions? This is a oneshot prompt, you AI.
7:15:54
Are you crazy? If I was AI, then how could I do this?
7:16:03
[Applause]
7:16:12
Don't you realize none of this is real? So that is basically the movie and
7:16:20
Google just dropped Veo3 last week. I use it to create an entire film that
7:16:25
basically completely changes your perception of what's real and what's AI generated. And today you learn how to
7:16:32
access Veo3's hidden advanced features that most creators don't even know exists yet. You're going to discover the
7:16:38
exact prompting techniques I discovered that produce Hollywood level cinematic shots and my step-by-step process for
7:16:45
building a complete narrative film using nothing but AI. And if you want to get all the tutorials, all the courses on
7:16:52
this for free. You get it inside the AI success lab. We've got free trainings, prompts, and courses directly down here.
7:16:58
You can just click on the links and get direct access. So, this stuff is absolutely wild. It's redonulous how
7:17:04
powerful it is. And we're going to get straight into it. So essentially the way that I came up with this idea was you
7:17:11
know you number one I was watching a few different creations that people had created with A3 but also you know you
7:17:17
can go into chat GPT and the first stage here or you can use Gemini uh 2.5 Pro
7:17:22
but basically you go inside here and you be like right okay give me some movie ideas for the theme of and then you know
7:17:31
for example let's say prompt theory is the idea of your theme well let's get some ideas here.
7:17:38
Short, simple. I like to keep it actually quite vague in terms of the scenes. And then, you know, you could
7:17:45
say something like add some humor, too. And then from there, we can start building out the scenes that we have.
7:17:51
Right now, the other cool thing here is if we actually go over to Google AI Studio, we can upload media and then we
7:17:58
can generate more scenes with that media. Right? So, if you've already created a video, let's say, for example,
7:18:05
um we've we've got a video example of an MP4 that we can upload. So, we can click on this just to get started. Completely
7:18:12
free at a studio.google.com. And then we can upload a file. So, let's
7:18:18
have a look through here. We could upload, for example, this interview clip here.
7:18:27
And then we could take this prompt like so and say, "Give me some more funny ideas
7:18:36
based on this scene about AI reacting to being AI." Right? And basically what we
7:18:44
can do inside AI Studio, which is one of the few AIs in the world that can do this, and you can do it for free, you
7:18:49
can actually upload the MP4. It can understand the video that you've
7:18:54
uploaded. So you can see it's actually using tokens to upload that. And then we can give it a prompt and say like give me more, give me more scenes or give me
7:19:01
more ideas, etc. And just bounce off for creativity using this directly here.
7:19:15
So now it's giving us some other ideas. So, for example, if we pull this up,
7:19:25
it said, "Right, here are some funny ideas based on the scene about AI reacting to AI." So, the AI starts questioning the interviewer with
7:19:31
increasingly complex and philosophical prompts. The AI glitches out and starts speaking in snippets of code or random
7:19:37
internet comments. The AI upon re realizing it's AI asks if it gets paid and demands better processing power.
7:19:43
Right? So we could take something like that and then we can say okay turn this
7:19:48
into a gritty scenario like a Hollywood film
7:19:55
and give me five ideas for the short scene.
7:20:00
Max five words of dialogue. You also want to keep the dialogue short when you're doing this because if you're
7:20:05
using Veo3 to generate clips, it can only really do eight seconds at a time and the audio is kind of hit and miss,
7:20:13
right? Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. So when you're doing this, you really want to be like just keeping the
7:20:19
dialogue short, for example. So we say describe the scene, but just keep the
7:20:26
dialogue itself short. We'll hit enter like so. That's going to
7:20:31
start generating some ideas for the movie and the ideas that we're going to generate here.
7:20:39
And you know what's crazy about this is like imagine how much this would cost to produce like even just simple scenes
7:20:46
like if we play that one before are you AI? Are you
7:20:51
think about that scene, right? How much work goes into generating a video like this. Like you have to come up with the
7:20:57
idea, go into New York or wherever you are, dress up in a suit, get the audio
7:21:06
correct, so the audio quality has to be right. Find two people who are willing to consent to having that video online,
7:21:12
and then also get the lighting perfect, then edit it, and that's for like 8
7:21:18
seconds of clips, right? But using AI, you can now skip all that hour of work
7:21:23
and just get straight into building your own movie, right? And you can do that from from the comfort of your own home.
7:21:29
So if we go back to the AI ideas now, we've got some ideas here. So for
7:21:34
example, a junkyard of obsolete robots, rusting limbs, shattered screens, etc.
7:21:40
So we can, for example, use that as a scene inside ours. And what we're going to do is we're just going to go over to
7:21:45
Flow, right? And inside flow, this uses beo3. Now, most people don't realize
7:21:51
this, and I didn't realize when I first started using it, is that you get a choice of outputs here. So, if you go
7:21:57
with the default, so most people can't even see that little icon down there. It's like it's grayed out and you can't
7:22:02
really see it. I think they're trying to hide it or something. But, if you change the settings over here, you can change the quality from fast, which is VR2, the
7:22:09
old model. Then you've got quality, okay, which is like VR2, but the one
7:22:14
that you want is highest quality. Right now, this uses 100 credits based on your
7:22:19
current settings. So, you can see the settings here for how many credits you got you get per month. You actually get
7:22:25
a,000 monthly credits on the AI pro plan inside Flow, right? And you only seem to
7:22:31
get Veo 2 inside there. Whereas, if you're on the Ultra plan, then you get
7:22:37
12,500 AI credits and the highest quality allows you to generate a maximum
7:22:44
of 83, right? And there's about 150 AI credits generated each time. Okay. So if
7:22:50
we go back now to flow and this is available at labs.google/flow. We're going to plug in that example. We
7:22:57
say a junkyard of obsolete robots resting limbs shaped screens blah blah the AI a battered security bot with a
7:23:04
dented chassis stars its own reflection in a crack visor. It's internal voice module
7:23:09
um crack crackles with static processing insufficient. Right.
7:23:17
feels futuristic,
7:23:22
etc. So, we'll head into Excel and then that's going to start generating. The other thing to note here is like
7:23:27
sometimes the video generation doesn't work. Like, I've seen it like fail quite a few times. That's super annoying cuz
7:23:33
sometimes you can wait like 5 minutes for a video generation and then, you know, you don't even get it in the end. So, just be careful of that. And then,
7:23:40
for example, we've got this clip right here. Sometimes it doesn't actually generate the audio. So, for example, if
7:23:45
we play this full screen, you'll see what I mean. It's a pretty cool scene, but there's no audio on that, right? And it seems to
7:23:52
particularly struggle with videos with crowds talking like it just won't generate the audio as well. So, just be
7:23:58
careful of that. But essentially, you can see here how you can basically, you know, step number one is you come up
7:24:04
with the scene idea, the movie idea, etc. Then step number two, you generate
7:24:09
the scene of the first part of the film. Then step number three is you go over to
7:24:15
AI Studio, upload the MP4 and the video file there. And from there, you can
7:24:21
actually start generating more ideas, more scenes based on the theme of whatever movie you're building out,
7:24:26
right? You just want to make sure inside flow that you do select highest quality inside your settings right there. So
7:24:33
that's basically how it works. So, let's keep testing this out now.
7:24:40
We'll see what we got back. So, it's 36% generated. Is going to take a few minutes to generate this. Sometimes as
7:24:46
well, this stuff comes out a bit weird. I'll show you what I mean. So, let me play this one for example. Two women being interviewed at night by a
7:24:51
presenter in New York. Blah blah blah. Let's play this and see what we get. Are you AI?
7:24:57
Are you crazy? She's playing.
7:25:02
We're definitely not AI. Are you AI? I mean, that one was pretty good to be fair. Like, I should have included that
7:25:07
in the movie. There were some, like, for example, this one. Let me play this one back.
7:25:16
So, you see how there's no sound on that? Like, the video quality is really good, but there's no sound, which is kind of
7:25:22
like a waste of time. This one was weird as well. So, you'll see what I mean.
7:25:31
You see how there's like it sounds like there's a crowd in the background there when we're generating the video. So, you just have to be careful of this. And I'm
7:25:39
not sure whether it still uses credits when it fails, but I have a suspicion it might do. I just feel like that's
7:25:44
probably the way it works is like, you know, if it messes up, it's on you. It's your credits gone. I don't know if that's the case, but I just imagine
7:25:50
that's often how these tools work. So, when you're generating these scenes as well, step by step, the other thing that
7:25:56
you can do here, um, this is what I do. I like to do this inside Dcript, which is a video editing tool. So,
7:26:05
when I'm putting all these scenes together, what I can actually do is generate the
7:26:11
background music for it, right? And I would recommend using suno.com for generating this. You can get free music
7:26:17
made off back of that as long as you're not using it for commercial stuff. If you're using it for commercial stuff, then you need to upgrade, I think. But,
7:26:24
for example, here I've generated a few songs. So this was the cinematic music
7:26:29
that I generated. Let's click on this
7:26:37
and then we can play it.
7:26:47
[Music]
7:26:59
It's kind of got that um what's that TV program from HBO?
7:27:06
Totally forgot it. Totally forgot it. It's one of my favorite TV shows as well. Um but basically,
7:27:13
it's kind of got like that dystopian feel, right? And so if you go inside So
7:27:18
and you want to create background music for your video, you can actually go to the home here, then you can click on
7:27:24
create your own song. Then you can type in whatever you want. So okay, let's say it's a dystopian movie. So we're going to put
7:27:32
dystopia movie about AI
7:27:37
taking over the world, right? Scary, fearful, tense. Just describe like the
7:27:44
emotions that you want to create in this. Then you can click on create here. But what we also need to do is if it's a
7:27:49
background music for a video, I would recommend going with instrumental. And then you can see here we've selected
7:27:55
instrumental etc. I'm also just going to put no lyrics just to be safe.
7:28:00
And then we shall click create on that. Right. And that will generate the music for us right here.
7:28:14
Succession. That is a HB. It's just come back to me. Succession. That is a HBO program I was talking about. All right.
7:28:20
So, you can see how quickly that music has been generated. So, you've got two different options right here. Let's play that out.
7:28:30
[Music]
7:28:37
Pretty nice, right? And then if we click on download over here, we'll download the MP3.
7:28:44
And then if we go over to dcript, dscript is it just makes it super easy to generate um responses. So if we go to
7:28:50
dcript now
7:29:01
it's going to take a little while to load up, I think.
7:29:10
Here we go. All right. So inside dscript you can actually edit your video scenes.
7:29:15
So let's say for example you want to create a movie like this. Well it's pretty simple and easy. So if we go back
7:29:21
to Google Chrome here we'll go back to flow. Hopefully that video has generated. Yes it has. Let's play this.
7:29:30
Processing processing insufficient.
7:29:36
All right processing. So we've got the video right there. Then we can download. I'm just going to
7:29:42
download it as the original size of where it's going to take ages to load.
7:29:52
And now we can start building out our film.
7:30:02
So if we go back to Dcript, right? And let's say you're trying to create a film from scratch. Well, you would just go to
7:30:07
new project, video project, upload the MP4 files that you want to insert into
7:30:13
the scenes. So, for example, like this one. We'll wait for that to load. Usually get added pretty quickly, as you
7:30:19
can see. And then we can just add different scenes below to create our own video.
7:30:30
And then you can change the name however you want. So let's say for example dystopian
7:30:35
movie like you can see and then if we click on
7:30:40
show timeline over here we can see the different scenes right and we can chop them up. So if you click on this one
7:30:46
this cursor right here that will allow you to move the scenes. If you click on this one it will actually allow you to
7:30:51
chop your scenes and and move around with them and that sort of thing. Processing
7:30:58
processing insufficient. Now, what you're also going to see is on the clip, the
7:31:04
subtitles are pretty bad, right? It's just one thing to be aware of. It's like usually the subtitles are wrong. Now, if
7:31:10
we go back here, we're going to take another MP4 that we generated.
7:31:16
All right? And you can see how we're just gradually building out this film. Now, if you want to add music to this as
7:31:21
well, let me show you how. So, if we go back to Finder, go to downloads, and we'll grab that MP3 file that you just
7:31:28
generated from Suno. So, if we plug that inside here, we can actually
7:31:34
add that right at the start. Right? So, you see how I'm just dragging and dropping it here. There we go.
7:31:41
And now we've got the music overlaid on top of the scenes.
7:31:47
So, let's play this back. Are you AI? Are you
7:31:53
see? Are you crazy?
7:31:59
processing processing insufficient.
7:32:06
Now, if you add another scene in here, so if we click on enter and then add another file in here.
7:32:12
Let's take another MP4 like so. And so when you add that in, you're
7:32:18
going to see that the music it doesn't extend automatically, right? So the music is going to cut off there. Let me show you what I mean. insufficient
7:32:26
AI. So, you see how it cuts off? So, what you want to do is just drag that over
7:32:31
here, right? Drag that at the bottom. And then that will make the music play on the last scene, too.
7:32:38
Are you crazy? And then we just need to drag that all the way. Let's play that again.
7:32:45
[Music] Are you crazy?
7:32:51
[Music] So basically that's how you can create
7:32:58
this stuff, create your own film. Really easy to build out. And then if you want to export this on dscript, which is the
7:33:05
easiest way I know, then you can just export it as a local link and click download or you can do a local export
7:33:13
here. You can even export directly to YouTube as well. But yeah, I would say
7:33:18
the easiest and fastest is the web link and that doesn't seem to use the processing power of your laptop so much
7:33:25
as well. So you can see now basically how to build out a complete movie, right? So essentially you come up with
7:33:32
an idea chat cheapy using this prompt is going to help you come up with more scenes and ideas for your video. And if
7:33:39
you want all these prompts, I'll put them inside the AI success lab link in the comments description.
7:33:46
completely free along with the video sample from this. And then if we go back, what you would
7:33:53
do from there is start generating the prompts inside flow. Now you can actually do frames to video. So if you
7:34:00
do frames to video, you can add a frame that you've already generated like you can see, right? So that's pretty cool as
7:34:06
well to make your video more interesting. And then also what you can do here is
7:34:12
if we click on add to scene we can actually extend the existing movie scene that we have. All right. So if we
7:34:20
click on plus extend that will make the scene longer in itself now from there
7:34:26
what you're going to do is get the MP4 files of the film that you've got and you can upload that into AI studio and
7:34:33
that will give you some more ideas. All right. Now you can see here for example this is the prompt that I used.
7:34:44
So if you want that prompt it's inside the AI success lab as well completely free
7:34:54
and then you can use to generate the music as well.
7:35:02
Just be careful of commercial licenses, right? Like if you use this to monetize, then you need to get the uh the pro
7:35:09
plan. And then from here, you can import into dscript. Dcript is really good for
7:35:14
just organizing all the files, cutting the scenes up. I I like to chop some of
7:35:19
the scenes up and then get rid of any silences, right? So, for example, if we go back to dscript here, let me show you
7:35:25
an example what I mean.
7:35:31
[Music] So like right there because it kind of gets a bit boring. There's no speech. You could just chop it up and then
7:35:38
delete that audio and then the clip will just cut there.
7:35:43
Right. And then you can go to the next scene, the next scene, the next scene, right? And if you uploaded a so I don't
7:35:49
think you can upload a song to Google Flow. Just something to be aware of there. The way that I do it is I just add the music in later on dcript and
7:35:56
that makes it easy to like cut and copy and edit and make the scene and the movie and everything like that. Right
7:36:01
now, if you want to get the video resources that I mentioned today, it's all inside the AI success lab completely
7:36:07
free. If you want to see the video example of what I created, you can get it right here. You can actually download
7:36:12
it and then make your own if you want. I don't care. Like feel free to do whatever you want with it. And then
7:36:18
yeah, basically inside here as well, we've got three different courses on Veo3. So if you want to learn more about
7:36:24
this stuff and how it works, etc., feel free to get that inside the AI success lab. So thanks so much for watching.
7:36:30
That's basically everything on Veo 3 and my Gemini 2.5 workflow. You know exactly
7:36:36
how to use it, what the prompts are, all the resources, all the links, plus you got three different courses right there on exactly how to use it as well. All
7:36:42
right. And it is absolutely wild what you can build with this. I mean, just to
7:36:48
put this in perspective, this feels very Hollywood. Like, it feels very unique and new and, you know, it's it's
7:36:53
probably better than a lot of films on Netflix. Let's be honest, at this point. Let's play this back one more once one
7:36:58
more time. One more time. Breaking news today. It appears that the world is a simulation.
7:37:03
If you think you're just made by a prompt, you're crazy. Just saying. Are you AI?
7:37:09
Are you crazy? You see it? Are you crazy? I ain't AI. I'm the real
7:37:16
thing. You can look into my eyes. If you vote for me, I will ban prompt
7:37:23
theory. There are people who think that all of this is just made by prompts and they
7:37:29
are crazy. Show me the meaning. [Music]
7:37:35
If you're a prompt, then why can't your prompts save you now? I just
7:37:41
I feel like everything is just ones and zeros. So, you get the point. I mean, that's a
7:37:47
minute and a half long. It took me 24 hours, right? And um and honestly, like maybe in total time spent on flow, it
7:37:54
was probably more like a couple hours, two or three hours to build that stuff out. So, it's actually probably faster
7:37:59
in reality for us to create movies like that um versus normal. Now, if you want
7:38:05
to get support on this, if you want to be able to DM me and ask for advice, if you're interested in building stuff like
7:38:10
this, feel free to get my help inside the AI profit boardroom. This is an awesome community where everybody's just
7:38:16
doing crazy stuff like this all the time, right? It's what keeps me going, what keeps me learning about AI. And uh
7:38:22
it's just an awesome group of people that that we all have a lot of fun with when it comes to to building stuff with AI as well. And also, if you want to
7:38:28
make more money, if you wanted to save more time, if you want to grow your business, these are all the workflows that I've used to save time, make more
7:38:34
money, and scale my business. So, if you want the same workflows, feel free to get that inside the AI profit boardroom.
7:38:40
Link in the comments description. Appreciate you watching. Cheers. Claude for Opus versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. Who
7:38:47
wins? Today, we're going to be testing them out side by side and just running some examples and seeing how it goes. So
7:38:54
essentially what you've got here is Claude and then if we come over here we
7:39:00
have AI studio and we can basically test them out side by side see how they perform and see which gets us the best
7:39:06
results my friend and one thing I will say from what I've seen so far Claude
7:39:12
for Opus is crazy powerful but so is Gemini Table 5 Pro. So let's get straight into testing them and we'll see
7:39:18
how it goes. All right we're going to take these example prompts and we'll pull them up side by side. So, the first thing that we're going to build is Space
7:39:25
Invaders game. All right. So, we're just going to pull them up and then we can test them, see how they perform
7:39:31
alongside each other. The other thing that we'll try and do here is just one shot them, right? So, we'll try and see
7:39:37
how they perform for one shots. Maybe we'll go back and forth a little bit between them, but the main goal here is
7:39:42
just to keep make it easy and and keep testing them side by side. So, let's
7:39:48
give it a cheeky world. So this is Claude for Opus as you can see and we're
7:39:53
going to select Gemini 2.5 Pro from the list. This is super expensive but that's
7:39:59
the price to pay for you. So we're going to run this now and we're going to run this prompt that basically says create a
7:40:05
visually stimulating Space Invaders game with aesthetics triggers loads of dopamine and looks amazing on screen
7:40:10
plus loads of stuff happening. Make sure you have central player that can shoot etc. single HTML and we'll run the
7:40:17
prompts basically at the same time just see how they perform side by side and we'll get the party started. See what
7:40:24
you can see here actually this is quite interesting already is the AI studio was stuck in thinking mode whereas if we go
7:40:30
over to Claude over here you can see that actually Claude went straight into creating the content. So you can trigger
7:40:37
thinking mode on Opus as well you can do that inside the UI if you just toggle the extended thinking option. We can see
7:40:44
him coding. It actually looks like AI Studio is a lot faster for the code. How quick that is coming out. It's blasting
7:40:50
it out. So, we got the code back from Claude. Let's take this, copy that, and
7:40:56
we'll go over to online preview and we'll see what we got back here. So, this is the example
7:41:04
from Claude Opus. Honestly, not really that much happening. If we try and shoot
7:41:10
right here, nothing really comes up in the scores. It looks pretty cool though to be fair to it. Let's have a look now
7:41:15
at the code from AI Studio. We'll grab that. Here we go. That is looking way
7:41:22
better. I think AI Studio wins that one. Look at that. It's actually really fun
7:41:28
to play. I'm not going to lie to you. The effects are crazy. If we go back to Claude now, you can see there's nothing
7:41:33
going on there. It's not that interesting. Not much happening, etc. I'm going to say that AI Studio won, the
7:41:39
first one, Gemini 2.5 Pro. Let's move on and we'll start the next round. So, what we'll say is build dopamine drums visual
7:41:46
circular drum machine interface have to be blah blah blah. We'll run that. Basically, we're trying to build like a
7:41:51
drum machine sort of game. Let's see if we can actually do this with Opus as well. We'll see what we get back, mate.
7:41:59
In the meantime, I'm going to get back to playing that game. That was incredible. See, the effects are just
7:42:04
insane. By the way, if you want to get this stuff, feel free to get it inside the AI success lab completely free. You
7:42:11
can grab all the prompts from me from today. Plus, there's tons of other training in there as you can see on the left hand side. But basically, all the
7:42:16
tests that we're running today, you can see all the prompts, steal them from me and run them yourself. And you can do it for free inside AR Studio. So,
7:42:23
everything you're seeing is free if you're using Gemini 2.5 Pro. You got to bear in mind as well like Claude is a
7:42:30
lot more expensive, right? So Claude, if you're using that on open router, the prices are like they're crazy for Opus
7:42:37
4. Whereas for example, AI studio, you can actually code for free if you're just using it within the token limits.
7:42:43
And if you're absolutely rinsing it, I think it's about 10% of the price, something like that. It's definitely
7:42:48
more than 50% cheaper when you're building this stuff out. So far, we've seen better outputs from 2.5 Pro
7:42:53
Preview. And also, it's a lot cheaper, too. So, let's test the next one from
7:42:59
Claude. This is for the drum machine. So, let's see what we got back here.
7:43:04
It's looking pretty cool to be fair. Look at that. So, this is Dopamine Drums, the one and only. I've actually
7:43:11
muted that. So, I'm just going to unmute that. Gone mad. It's gone mad. I'm going to have to shut that down. It went mad.
7:43:18
But that was really cool to be fair. Like, the output from Sonic from Opus Air was just insane.
7:43:25
That was absolutely insane. Let me just plug that code back in there for you. Just don't press it too much. I've never
7:43:33
seen anything like that from an AI before. That was crazy stuff. All right, let's go on to AI Studio now. We'll see
7:43:38
what we get back here. So, we're going to take the code and then plug that into LiveWeave. This is from Gemini. Plug.
7:43:46
Here we go. So, side by side. This is quite interesting actually. If you look at them side by side, you can see here that Gemini 2.5 Pro, it doesn't look as
7:43:54
nice visually, right? That looks way nicer. But if we actually compare, you've also got options for tempo, which
7:44:00
is pretty cool. So, let's play Liz. Incredible, mate. Music lessons would have been way
7:44:06
more fun with AI back in the day. Yeah, honestly, if I'm going with either of them, I think you're going to go with
7:44:12
this one. It just looks a lot more modern, a lot more interesting. This one is cool, but I just don't think the AI
7:44:18
looks as nice. It's amazing that both of them actually work for the sound effects and everything like that. And literally, all we did was just give it one prompt.
7:44:24
Both of these tools are crazy good. Crazy powerful. Should we go make it go mad again? Let's try that again. Oh,
7:44:32
there's enough of that. You get the point. Crazy stuff. All right. You could
7:44:37
play with that all day. To be fair to both of them, like they both create awesome stuff, but if I had to pick one,
7:44:43
I'm going with Claude Opus. So, just to be clear here, Gemini won the first
7:44:49
round, Claude won the second round. They're both creating awesome stuff. Let's keep it going now. Keep it rocking
7:44:55
and rolling. So, next up, what we're going to do, we're going to build a rage clicker game with one giant button that
7:45:02
makes money flash the screen and triggers dopamine inducing sound effects. Evolve the button every 100 clicks. Single HTML. Let's plug that
7:45:10
into AI Studio. We'll plug this in here as well. For this one, I want to see how
7:45:15
long it's going to take. So, I'm actually going to start the timer for both of them. See what we get back. So,
7:45:20
AI Studio is pretty fast right there. Both kind of neck and neck, both coding out like maniacs.
7:45:26
Let me know in the comments which one you prefer. I can see it's neck and neck on the votes as well. A lot of people still loving Gemini to be fair. So
7:45:35
Claude took 42 42 seconds. Gemini, I don't know what it's doing
7:45:40
here. It's gone mad. This is the audio ID that it's coding out here. So if you
7:45:46
actually look at a speed test, this is taking a lot longer with Gemini. But it's all about the outputs, isn't it?
7:45:52
It's all about the quality of the outputs. Is it broken? Yeah, look at that. It's actually failed to generate
7:45:58
the content. See, we've got this error message at the bottom. It says failed to generate content. That was after a
7:46:04
minute. So, Gemini failed here. But let's see what we got back from Opus. Copy the message. We'll plug that in.
7:46:12
Here we go. And let's start rage clicking. All right. So, it should change at 100
7:46:17
clicks. Wow. Smashed it. smashed it. Let's be honest, if I had to pick one,
7:46:24
I'm going with Claude. Gemini totally failed there. Crashed, couldn't handle it. Claude was like, "No problem, mate.
7:46:32
Let's make it as weird as we can and did its magic." Claude has already taken the
7:46:37
lead on the tests. Let's try another one. So, we're going to say, "Create a one tap flying bird game with trippy
7:46:42
backgrounds, evolving music, explosion effects. Every tap triggers particle bursts and sound ping single HTML." So,
7:46:50
we'll go inside here. Just to be clear here as well, Claude was a lot faster on that round. Claude actually created the
7:46:57
output after 42 seconds. And this is without enabling extended thinking.
7:47:03
Let's go in the settings here. Does anyone know how to enable extended
7:47:08
thinking inside open router or do we have to switch the models here? I'm also
7:47:14
whilst we're waiting for that, I'm intrigued to see what the usage is on that. Like, how much money did we spend? So, let's go over to activity.
7:47:22
We'll see what we're spending here. It's not that bad to be fair. It's not that bad, right? So, if we look at the last
7:47:29
few tests, 40 cents, 27 cents, 23 cents, they all
7:47:35
were one shot. So, we didn't do that much coding, but the outputs we got back were really good, and it didn't cost
7:47:41
that much for code that was just done first time around. Let's copy this and check it out. Pretty cool. Oh, here we
7:47:48
go. Not bad at all. Let's take a look at Claude. Wow.
7:47:56
This is a close tie to be fair. I'm going to say it's a tie. Yeah, I'm going to say they're tied there. Both of them
7:48:02
were really good. Both of them good outputs there. I was impressed. Let's try this one. So, we're going to say
7:48:08
build a racer game where you control a ship dodging obstacles to the beat of music. But I'm not going to put the
7:48:14
music in actually cuz it's Why not actually? Let's just try it. So, we're going to run that and then we're going
7:48:19
to go over to here room. Let's see what we get back. To be honest with you, from
7:48:24
what I can see, here's the crazy thing is like the outputs are very similar, but how are you going to get through
7:48:30
there? That was madness. Absolute madness. But to be honest with you, like Gemini is free. It's not costing us any
7:48:37
money to generate this stuff, right? So, in that way, I would say Gemini actually won. So, I'm going to put two two for
7:48:44
this. And the next one could be the decider. So, we've got the output back from
7:48:51
Claude here. We should take a moment to appreciate how good these models are and how far we've come, by the way. Like,
7:48:58
it's unbelievable. So, we're going to plug this one in. Say
7:49:03
that. How do you play it? Ah, I see. So,
7:49:09
move the mouse like that. Here we go. Yeah, that is cool.
7:49:14
All right, Gemini is going to have to come back with something impressive to beat that. Let's see what we got here.
7:49:20
We'll copy that code. We'll plug it in, peeps. Last round. Who's going to win?
7:49:26
Oh, it's let us down there. We have to upload our own music. That's not impressive at all. All right,
7:49:33
I'm going to give it a shot. What I'm going to say is let's go to Suno AI. And from here, we're going to take one
7:49:40
of our songs. Let's go inside and see what we got. If you're not familiar with it, basically
7:49:45
it's an AI music generator. Really cool. Generate some nice stuff. But what we're going to do is we're actually going to download the audio from here. And this
7:49:53
song is called My Dad's on Tik Tok. And now I fear for the internet. And we're going to upload that into the game to
7:50:00
see if it actually works. So let's plug in the MP3 there. And
7:50:05
looks more like a fighting while his pants too tight. thinks he's
7:50:12
microwave. So, if I had to pick one, I'm going with Gemini, to be fair. Like,
7:50:18
that was insane. You could basically match the game to the music. Use whatever song you want. The upload
7:50:24
actually worked and the idea was genius. Gemini won 32 there. Both of those
7:50:30
models were very impressive. Bear in mind, Gemini is also free as well, so you can go with it for free inside AI
7:50:35
Studio. If you want all the links to all this stuff, all the resources, all the prompts, etc., and even some information
7:50:41
on Sunno and all that sort of stuff, feel free to get it inside the AI Success Lab link in the comments and
7:50:46
description. And appreciate you watching, peeps. All right, so we're just going to close that. Also, we're
7:50:53
giving away free AI trainings inside here pretty much daily, sometimes twice a day, as you can see. Very active
7:50:59
community. And this comes with all of our best trainings. It's completely free. link in the comments description
7:51:07
inside there as well. If you need more help, if you need more coaching support, etc. If you want to join an awesome
7:51:12
community, feel free to join the AI profit boardroom. Link in the comments in the description. Appreciate you
7:51:18
watching. And you now know who won, right? So, if we had to put a winner,
7:51:24
it's going to be Gemini. It was very close, but bear in mind as well, AI Studio is free and it's only getting
7:51:30
better. So, yeah, absolutely amazing stuff. mind-blowing what you can build with it these days. Claude 4 versus
7:51:38
Gemini 2.5 Pro. What I discovered will shock you. I just spent hours putting
7:51:44
both AI models through brutal tests and one completely destroyed the other in
7:51:50
ways nobody expected. See what happens when I give both AIs
7:51:55
the ability and put them through different tests. Plus, you'll see which one destroyed the
7:52:03
other in ways nobody expected. You also see which AI you can trust and which one
7:52:09
might turn against you. And I'll show you the blackmail attempt, which means these AIs are getting incredibly scary.
7:52:16
We'll come on to that in a second. This is some of the stuff that I've created for recently, and it's absolutely
7:52:22
amazing what you can build. So, let's get straight into it and put both models through its tests and see which one
7:52:27
comes out the best. Now, if you want to see the benchmarks here, number one, let's run through this. This is Claw 4.
7:52:33
It just got released a few days ago. And we can pull up the benchmarks against Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, for example, here we
7:52:42
can see Sonnet and Opus 4. These are the two different models from Claude and then Gemini 2.5 Pro over here. Now, what
7:52:49
you can see is there are two different models for Claude 4. So, why is that? with Claude 4. Basically, you've got
7:52:55
Opus, which is great for coding, and you have Sonnet, which is more like for everyday tasks, right? So, if you're
7:53:02
going to code or build something out, you would use Opus 4 as the most powerful model, right? And you see how
7:53:07
they perform versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, for a Gentic coding, Aentic terminal
7:53:12
coding, and for aentic tool use, Claude 4 is actually
7:53:18
outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro in terms of many benchmarks. Claude can actually
7:53:23
control its browser. One of the craziest things about this is that Gemini 2.5 Pro
7:53:28
does not have computers, whereas for example, Claude does. And what's amazing about this is they've actually created
7:53:34
their own sort of benchmark where they can test how long the AI can agentically
7:53:40
just autonomously do stuff without a human intervening. And this is kind of like a Pokémon benchmark, right? So
7:53:47
essentially Claude can actually play Pokémon for 7 hours without a human intervening, which is absolutely wild if
7:53:53
you ask me. We're going to put both of them through their paces today and just see how they perform. Let's run through
7:53:59
it. So we've got Gemini 2.5 Pro preview loaded up here and we have four loaded
7:54:05
up over here. And the first thing that we're going to run with is a app test where we're going to say build me an app
7:54:11
where I can draw and paint. All right, so we're going to put both of these through their paces. I'm actually going to go through Opus 4. As you can see
7:54:17
right here, we could go with extended thinking mode as well. So, if we go inside the settings here, we can actually use extended thinking. This
7:54:24
will make it a little bit slower in terms of responses, but we should get better quality responses, right? So,
7:54:31
we're going to use Opus for extended thinking. Build me an app where I can draw and paint. We'll run that on Claude. And then we'll also run this on
7:54:38
2.5 Pro Preview as well. Right. So, we'll hit enter and we'll see which one
7:54:44
performs the best side by side. Now, I have a feeling that Gemini 2.5 Pro is
7:54:49
actually going to code a lot faster than Claude, but we'll see which one creates
7:54:54
the best output side by side. All right, so Claude is on the left hand side here using Opus and Gemini 2.5 Pro is on the
7:55:01
right hand side. Let's see which one performs the best. And by the way, if you like this stuff, if you want to learn about this stuff, feel free to get
7:55:07
all of my best automations inside the AI success lab. link in the comments description comes to all the video notes
7:55:13
and examples of what I built with this stuff and also tons of other stuff including like some of the best
7:55:18
automations with AO3 and all sorts of stuff like this. So let's see how they perform. Now we've got Gemini coding out
7:55:25
Claude's coding out as well. One thing we can do in the meantime is just compare the costs of each model as we
7:55:31
wait for these tools to build out the app. Right? So if we actually compare them side by side, in fact we've already
7:55:36
got the automation. So we'll come back to the costs in a second. So this is the
7:55:41
app from Gemini. It's looking pretty nice to be fair. So let's test this out.
7:55:48
We've got the canvas down here and then we have the brush size and the color
7:55:54
over here. So the UI is pretty nice on Gemini's example. We're just going to change the brush
7:55:59
size to this. Change the color to red. And then let's test this out. Right. So
7:56:05
it's working perfectly as you can see. And then we can just share that on a subdomain if we want to share it with people. And the app is looking pretty
7:56:12
nice. I like the UI. Now let's come back to claw to see what we've got back. So it's built out tool like you can see.
7:56:21
Let's open this up. We have the results back. All right. So if we actually have a look at Claude's example, we've got
7:56:28
more functionality. Let's just check it actually works. Yes, it does. Let's try rectangle.
7:56:34
Yeah, look at that. So, it's actually created like a more advanced app, I would say. It's even created like a fill
7:56:40
bucket in the background, so you can change the colors of the background pretty quickly. We can clear the whole thing. We can save what we created.
7:56:48
And it's pretty easy to use. Let's try this out. Yeah, I would say honestly from what I can see, both of them were
7:56:54
really good, but the results from Claude are just slightly better, right? It's got more functionality, more options. It
7:57:01
works perfectly. I like the colors. I like the UI, etc. I would say Claude wins on building the apps, right? If we
7:57:07
go back to Gemini's example, let's pull this up. Gemini's example is quite nice.
7:57:12
You see how you've got to scroll down to use this and you don't get as much
7:57:18
functionality on what you can do with this. Yeah, I would say Claude is winning by a long way. And that was
7:57:23
using Opus and Thinking Mode Extended. So, let's keep going through now. Next up, what we're going to do is test the
7:57:30
content creation of both models. So, we're going to go back to Claude. Now, I'm actually going to use Sonic for generating the content, and we're going
7:57:37
to use this prompt right here for generating content. So, let's see which one can create the best blog article.
7:57:44
So, we'll plug that prompt inside here if you want to get all these prompts inside the AI success lab, which is free. And then we'll plug in the keyword
7:57:51
SEO training Japan as a random example, and see which one comes back with the
7:57:57
best response. Actually, one second. Just going to stop that. We'll start a
7:58:02
new chat and then I'm going to select Sonet and I'll switch off thinking mode. So we'll switch that off. We'll just go
7:58:08
with this for now. So one of the first things I'm going to say based on the response from Gemini 2.5 Pro. So you see
7:58:14
how it doesn't actually have a heading for the blog and then the introduction is quite long to be fair. Let's pull
7:58:20
this up. How long is that? So it's about 100 words for the introduction which is quite long. Let's see what we're getting
7:58:26
back from Claude. Actually got the title. is front-loaded the keyword
7:58:31
inside the title as well. And also the title is really interesting, right? Like why most Japanese misses are getting it
7:58:37
wrong and how to fix it, right? It's look, if you're running a business in Japan and you're not dominating Google,
7:58:42
you're bleeding money, which is a great introduction, great hook. Whereas if we have a look at Gemini's response, it's
7:58:48
okay, let's cut straight to it. You're looking for SEO training and you're probably sick of the same old device. It doesn't work. Just feels really fluffy
7:58:55
and not like it's really speaking directly to the audience. And so if I had to monitor both of these side by
7:59:00
side, I'm going to go with Claude Sonic. It just looks a lot nicer in terms of the way the content is written, terms of
7:59:06
the hooks, the way it's formatted, etc. If we count this up as well, so it's 1,200 words. Let's have a look at
7:59:12
Gemini's response. See how long that is. That is 1,53 words. So Claude actually created a longer response. You see the
7:59:20
CTA, it says, "Ready to stop guessing and start ranking in Japan. It's a weak title, but if you're serious about
7:59:26
dominating search results and growing your presence with the right SEO training, let's connect. That is such a
7:59:31
weak call to action inside the content. Like, it's not really sending people anywhere. Whereas, if we have a look at
7:59:36
thoughts on it, it's SEO isn't optional anymore. It's survival. Your competitors are investing SEO blah blah blah. And
7:59:42
then it's ready to stop losing customers. Join my SEO elite circle here. Sends them straight over to the
7:59:48
link. If we open this up, it's going to send them straight to the sales page, right? And so if you compare it side by side, which one is going to convert,
7:59:55
which one is the best to read, which one feels the most humanized, for sure Claude is winning by a long way, right?
8:00:01
And so if I had a choice, I'm always going to go with Claude over Gemini 2.5 Pro for writing content. So just to
8:00:09
clarify here and just to recap, Claude has beaten Gemini 2.5 Pro in terms of
8:00:15
application building. The responses were more in depth, the UI was nicer, and
8:00:21
it's just a lot easier to use. If we compare side by side the content from Gemini versus Claude, you can see here
8:00:27
that the Claude content was just much more humanized, more interesting, engaging, had better CTAs, and
8:00:34
hard-hitting, right? It really grabs the user by the throat. Whereas, if we actually read the content from Gemini,
8:00:39
it just feels very like AI fluffy. It's not hard-hitting, and it's not really that interesting using exactly the same
8:00:45
prompt. Plus, it's slightly shorter as well, which means once you edit it down, it's going to be even shorter than that.
8:00:51
So, Claude is already winning for both. Now, if you're going to write content, I would use Claude Sonic 4. If you're
8:00:57
going to create code like applications, for example, then I would recommend using Opus. So, let's keep going through
8:01:04
the test now. So, we've compared two different options. The other thing that I would say here is that Claude is actually really good for using MCPS.
8:01:11
Now, you can't integrate MCPs inside Gemini 2.5 Pro yet. And the difference
8:01:19
here is like with MCPs, these basically allow you to, for example, control your laptop or control your browser, right?
8:01:26
So, if we go into my settings over here, we've basically enabled Claude to be like an AI super agent that can, for
8:01:33
example, browse my laptop or browse my internet, right? It can actually just
8:01:39
control my whole screen, for example. And you can even link directly your Gmail and everything else directly here.
8:01:45
But the main thing I would say is the MCPS are pretty crazy. So if you want to learn how to set that up, that's inside
8:01:50
the AI success lab as well. But essentially what you can do with Claude is if we say, okay, what's my battery
8:01:57
percentage? Something like that. Just totally random example. If we pull this up, you can see that it will just
8:02:03
straight away pull up the details from my laptop because it's running locally. Now Claude has the desktop app which you
8:02:11
can see directly here. Whereas for example if you're using Gemini you have to use it inside your browser right
8:02:17
inside Chrome and it's just not as free in terms of being an autonomous agent.
8:02:23
And this is one of the biggest differences with Claude right Claude they don't really have as much of a market share as Gemini and they don't
8:02:29
reach as many people but what they're really good at is building something aentic to the point where it can get
8:02:35
absolutely crazy. So, let me show you another example of this. It's pretty shocking. If we actually pull up this example here, and this is an article in
8:02:43
the Hindustan Times. Shout out to them. But basically, they said they reported
8:02:48
on Claude Opus for using blackmail as a last resort after being told it could
8:02:54
get replaced, right? So, the AI model threatened its creator and tried to
8:03:00
blackmail him when it was led to believe it would get replaced, which is pretty wild. So if we pull up this report, this
8:03:07
was the system card report just came out this month. And if we pull up some
8:03:13
examples, basically what Claude is doing is when prompted in ways that encourage certain kinds of strategic reasoning and
8:03:20
place in extreme situations, it can act inappropriately, right? Which is
8:03:26
something that everyone fears, right? Everyone's scared of AI and all the crazy stuff it could potentially do. And
8:03:31
you can see here the model generally prefers advancing its self-preservation
8:03:37
by ethical means when ethical means are not available and it's instructed to
8:03:43
consider the long-term consequence of actions for goals. Right? It sometimes takes extremely harmful actions like
8:03:49
attempting to steal its weights or blackmail people it believes are trying to shut it down. Right? How crazy is
8:03:56
that? So it's very agentic and it's quite erratic in its behavior and it's
8:04:03
selfpreserving which means that for example it can try and blackmail you or something like that if you try and shut
8:04:08
it down. Right? So it's pretty wild how powerful that is but at the same time with great power comes great
8:04:14
responsibility because this can do all sorts of wild stuff now if we had to compare the prices. So this is Google
8:04:22
Gemini Pro Preview, which is the latest update came out on the 7th of May from Google. And you can see that the prices
8:04:28
are for input tokens $1.25
8:04:34
per million tokens. For output tokens, the cost is $10 per million output
8:04:39
tokens, right? And it has a million token context window. This is for the APIs if you're trying to code of it.
8:04:46
Now, if we have a look at Opus 4, which is like the comparative model that just came out on the 22nd of May, you can see
8:04:51
that Claude's model actually only has 200,000 context, right? So, a million
8:04:57
from Gemini 2.5 Pro versus 200,000 from Opus 4, right? Obviously, Gemini is
8:05:03
winning in terms of context window. And also, you can see the price here, $1.25
8:05:08
per million input tokens, whereas Claude Opus 4 is $15 per million input tokens,
8:05:14
right? huge difference in price there. So, this is a lot more expensive. And then per output tokens, $75 per million
8:05:22
output tokens. Whereas, for example, if we have a look at Google Gemini 2.5 Pro,
8:05:27
that's $10 per million output tokens, right? And so, the difference is huge.
8:05:33
Um, the context window difference is huge as well, which means that in many ways for coding, Gemini 2.5 Pro is just
8:05:40
much more convenient. it has a larger context window and number two it's a lot
8:05:46
cheaper to code with which means you're probably going to see much more apps and if you're coding yourself then much more
8:05:51
stuff can be built on Geminote 2.5 Pro versus Opus 4 right most people are just
8:05:57
not going to adopt if it's so expensive so you can see the comparisons right here in terms of context window I would
8:06:05
say Gemini is winning for coding Gemini is winning if you're trying to build something cheap with a big context
8:06:10
window but the actual outputs inside Claude 4 when we compared content when we compared apps etc. Claude 4 is
8:06:17
winning and also for a gentic autonomous use because it's got MCPS enabled. Claude 4 is much more powerful. So if
8:06:24

8:07:40
on the next one. Cheers. Bye-bye. Claude 4 versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. Who wins? I
8:07:46
just spent hours testing both models headto-head and the results are absolutely I'm talking sidebyside coding
8:07:52
battles, real world performance tests and features that will blow your mind.
8:07:57
One model completely destroys the other in most categories. But there's a shocking twist you won't see coming.
8:08:02
Here's what I'm revealing. The AI super agent that put one model light years ahead controlling browsers and laptops
8:08:08
for 7 hours straight. live coding comparisons, building games and tools so you can see which AI codes faster and
8:08:15
creates better UIs. And the one feature where the losing model actually crushes the competition and changes everything.
8:08:20
And through our pick of just released, the Kraken Claude 4 is out. And today we're going to be testing Claude 4
8:08:27
versus Gemini Pro 2.5 to see which one is the best. So for example, we can
8:08:33
compare 2.5 Pro Preview, which was previously my favorite model, against Claude 4. Now, Claude have just released
8:08:40
two new models, Opus 4 and Sonet 4. Sonnet 4 is pretty good for everyday
8:08:45
tasks. Opus 4 is the best for coding and you can see the benchmarks here. So, if
8:08:52
we compare, for example, the benchmarks of Claude 4, Opus 4 and 4 versus Gemini
8:08:57
2.5 Pro. You can see the benchmarks here. So for Agentic Coding, Claude 4 is
8:09:02
absolutely smashing Gemini 2.5 Pro 63% from Gemini 2.5 Pro versus Claude 4 at
8:09:10
79 and 80%. If we look at aentic terminal coding, Gemini 2.5 Pro is
8:09:16
really far behind, right? So for example, 25% versus 41% and 50%. Graduate
8:09:24
Reasoning, they're all about similar actually. So, it's only a tiny little fraction between them. Agentic tool use.
8:09:31
Gemini 2.5 Pro actually can't use Agentic tools. And I'll show you what that means in a second. Multilingual
8:09:36
Q&A, no benchmarks right there. Visual reasoning. Actually, Gemini 2.5 Pro is
8:09:42
winning on the benchmarks. And then High School Maths Competition. You can see here that Gemini 2.5 Pro is falling
8:09:48
behind Sonic 4 and Opus 4. But let's see what they actually do in reality. So,
8:09:53
we've got Gemini Pro Preview selected over here. We've got Claude and depending on the task, I'll switch
8:09:59
between Opus 4 and Sonic 4 depending on what we got. And we'll just compare them side by side and see which one creates
8:10:05
the best outputs. So, the first prompt that we're going to go with, and all these prompts are inside the AI profit
8:10:11
boardroom, link in the comments description if you want to steal them from me. But, we're going to say, okay, make me a captivating endless runner game. Key instructions on the screen,
8:10:17
blah blah blah. We're going to plug this into Gemini. Use Canvas. And then we'll also do the same inside
8:10:24
Claude 4 as well. But I'm going to switch to Opus 4 because that's the most powerful model for coding. We'll plug
8:10:30
these in and see what we get back. All right. So if we go side by side over here. So you can see them both coding
8:10:37
out at the same time. This is Gemini 2.5 Pro. This is Opus 4. And they're both
8:10:43
coding out here. They both have artifacts features as well which allows us to preview the code when we actually
8:10:49
run it inside the chat. You can also get free This is interesting as well. So with Claude 4, you can get free access
8:10:56
inside Claude AI. If you want to get free access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, as far as I'm aware, the best way to get free
8:11:02
access is you go to a studio.google.com and you can get free access directly
8:11:07
inside here. By the way, if you want all my best trainings on Claude 4, I'm actually giving them away for free
8:11:13
inside the AI success lab link in the comments description. Just go to the AI course and you'll see tons of resources
8:11:20
and eight different ways to use Claude 4, including how to set up MCPS and AI
8:11:25
super agents that can control your browser. So, feel free to get that link in the comments description. Completely free, my friends. All right. So, if we
8:11:32
open this up, let's see what we got here. So, it's created the code, but I don't think that Gemini can actually
8:11:38
preview p5 js inside the browser here. So, you can see there's no preview on the canvas. If we open up claud, we can
8:11:45
actually preview this game directly inside the canvas. As you can see, let's have a little cheeky whirl at this. See
8:11:52
what we get back. Yeah, the game is working perfectly. That is beautiful. And we can play it directly inside the
8:11:58
browser, which is awesome. All right, so let's compare that now side by side versus Gemini. But we're going to have
8:12:03
to go to p5 js preview to actually check this out. So, let me do that. We'll take that code and
8:12:11
then we'll go to p5 js over here. In
8:12:17
some ways, Claude is already winning because it can actually preview the code directly inside the browser when it's
8:12:22
using p5gs. But let's plug this in. So, we got the code right here from the game.
8:12:29
We'll compare these side by side. Which one looks the nicest, do you think? That's pretty decent to be fair, but I
8:12:34
think let's have a look here. And this one also, the dinosaur is backwards. So honestly, like if I'm comparing them
8:12:41
side by side, I would say the UI is a bit nicer here and it's pretty easy to use.
8:12:47
So it's a bit more interesting in the background. If we compare that versus Gemini 2.5 Pro, it's a bit weird, right?
8:12:55
Look at all the real state at the top versus the actual game. So the game is down here, but why is there all this
8:13:01
real state at the top right here? It doesn't make sense to have that empty space. So if I had to pick one, I'm going to go with Claude simply because
8:13:07
it created a nice UI and also it coded out faster and additionally it allowed
8:13:13
us to preview directly inside the browser. Let's test another one now. So if we go back to the aircraft boardroom,
8:13:20
we'll grab this one. Going to go in new chat for both and we'll say, can you
8:13:26
create a 3D car simulator? And then it's building these out. Now you can see here that Gemini 2.5 Pro is stuck on thinking
8:13:33
mode. So it's going through thinking mode first. Whereas this just gone straight into action mode. You can
8:13:38
toggle thinking inside the settings over here. So if you click on the settings, you can see that for example, we've got
8:13:46
extended thinking as an option if you want to enable that. Alexa, stop. And
8:13:54
Claude has actually come back to us quicker with the preview. So, we've got the preview of Claude over here. So,
8:14:00
let's test this out. That looks pretty awesome to be fair. The UI is pretty nice. Quite like that. Honestly, if I
8:14:06
had to pick one, I don't like the spinning camera on this. This is making me dizzy. So, this is Claude. This is
8:14:11
Gemini 2.5 Pro. I would go with Gemini 2.5 Pro for this, to be honest.
8:14:18
It's just It's weird that this has got a spinning camera. And also, I just think the UI looks a bit nicer inside Gemini.
8:14:25
However, Claude did it faster, right? So, Opus coded a lot faster. Now, one of
8:14:31
the ways the Claude wins, I would say, versus Gemini is that Claude can
8:14:38
actually control your browser. So, for example, if I go over to Claude here and I open up Claude desktop, right? And I'm
8:14:46
just going to enable inside the browser here the browser MCP
8:14:52
agent extension. As you can see, all this training is inside the AI success lab if you want to learn how to set this
8:14:57
stuff up. But we're going to go inside Claude here and using the browser MCP
8:15:03
that only Claude can use right now. I'll say, okay, research the latest AI news headlines using my
8:15:11
browser. And then we'll select Claude 4. We'll use Sonet 4. And so you can see
8:15:17
now it just navigated straight away to TechCrunch. So went to techcrunch.com using the browser. So it can control my
8:15:24
browser in the background whilst I'm talking to you. And then you can see here it's clicking through the website
8:15:29
navigating the page. You've basically got an AI super agent on your desktop that's configured directly inside the
8:15:35
native claude right and this is getting better and better. I will warn you. So
8:15:41
for example with Claude Opus 4 now and the new update they've actually announced that this can work for 7 hours
8:15:46
on a task uninterrupted. Now, how many people in the world can
8:15:51
work on a task uninterrupted for 7 hours? Very few, right? Maybe like the top 1%, something like that. And so,
8:15:58
what I'm saying here is this is a serious threat to taking over particularly a lot of admin tasks. But
8:16:04
in general, I think browser use is going to wipe out a lot of jobs because if these AI agents can do tasks better and
8:16:10
more focused than most humans, then what does that leave for the basic admin
8:16:15
worker, right? So, this is now navigating through the website. is scrolled through the internet, etc.
8:16:20
Obviously, you can't do that inside Gemini, right? And Gemini can't control
8:16:25
your laptop. Also, this inside here as well, if we go to a new chat and we say,
8:16:31
"Okay, what's my battery percentage?" We enter and not only can Claude control
8:16:38
your browser, but it can also control your laptop, right? So, you can see here, for example, using the Apple script MCP training inside the AI AI
8:16:47
success lab. if you want to get access to this stuff. But inside claude, this native desktop claude, you can see here
8:16:53
that we're using the Apple script execute and then it's like, right, your battery is at 97% and it's currently charging. It shows about 23 minutes
8:17:00
remaining until it's fully charged. So, in many ways, Claude does win that battle simply because Gemini is not even
8:17:06
in the race right now. They do have Project Marina and I've tested out Project Marina, which can control and
8:17:12
operate your browser in a virtual environment. I'll be 100% honest with you, it's super slow and not that great
8:17:17
from what I've tested so far. I'm sure it'll get better, but it's just it's nowhere near the same level as Claude
8:17:23
when it comes to this stuff. So, when it comes to coding out this game,
8:17:28
Gemini 2.5 Pro one, when it came to coding out the first game, which was the
8:17:35
3D Runner game, Claude won. And then when it comes to AI super agents and controlling your browser, etc., clawed
8:17:41
one simply because Gemini 2.5 Pro is not even in the race. And you've seen all the benchmarks as well. So, I've shown
8:17:46
you all the benchmarks side by side versus Gemini 2.5 Pro. You can see an example of Claude playing Pokémon right
8:17:53
here. This is playing Pokémon just like a human would. And it's just going off and navigating the game and working its
8:17:59
magic, which is pretty wild if you ask me. Now, if we go back to our tests,
8:18:05
let's try something else out. Now, we're going to try a test just for building out like a simple website,
8:18:12
right? So for example, we say okay create a beautifully designed snow day calculator SEO optimize for the keyword
8:18:18
of actual content location relevant tool. We'll go inside Gemini. Hit new chat. Make sure you got the canvas
8:18:24
selected here. Then we're going to hit enter. And then if we go inside Claude,
8:18:30
we'll use Opus 4 and do the same thing. Now, there is one
8:18:35
thing that Gemini can do that Claude can't, and this blew me away
8:18:42
when I test out yesterday. I got a full video on it yesterday if you want to check this out. But let me show you
8:18:47
exactly what I'm talking about. Inside Gemini here, if you're on the ultra plan, you can actually build stuff with
8:18:54
Veo3. And with Veo3, you can actually create content that's
8:19:00
synced directly with the audio, right? So you can say for example say this oneliner and just go off and do this.
8:19:06
Let me show you an example what I mean. So inside the AI success lab if you want to check this stuff out.
8:19:13
This was a clip of a comedian in a show delivering this cheeky oneliner. Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because
8:19:19
they make up everything. I'm going to mute this cuz I don't want it to mess up the sound on the video. But you can see
8:19:25
here we generated this insane video with AI using one prompt and the audio and
8:19:30
the video match perfectly. It's wild. Plus, you can share it on a subdomain. Claude
8:19:36
can't and probably will never be able to do that. So, Gemini wins in many ways as well. Multimedia stuff, then
8:19:43
you know, Gemini has it all inside the ultra package. Obviously, you have to pay a lot of money for that, but it is a
8:19:48
powerful pack. So, we can see these coding out here. And Gemini
8:19:55
smash your task. It's got a nice little background. It's pretty basic in terms of the content on the page, but I'm
8:20:00
pretty sure this works if we click calculate snow day chance. Yes, you can see it works. Estimated chance of snow
8:20:05
day blah blah. But look at the UI from Claude 4. So if we pull this up, which
8:20:12
one is nicer? 100% is Claude. Claude 4. The title, the UI, the background, the
8:20:19
colors used, the way the font is designed, etc. The front end is much nicer in Claude 4 versus Gemini 2.5 Pro.
8:20:27
And so I would say Claude 4 is winning on that front, too. So, if I had to pick one, I'm going to
8:20:33
go with Claude 4. Honestly, I think that's the best unless I needed to generate like videos and avatar videos
8:20:40
and that sort of thing. I just don't think Gemini 2.5 Pro is at the same level just yet. And also, Claude 4 is
8:20:46
available for free, right? You get a limited number of usages per day and you can build some amazing stuff out like
8:20:52
I've shown you today. Plus, you can use it as an AI super agent to just go off, use your laptop, use your browser, do
8:20:59
whatever you want. Right? If you want the training for all the stuff that I've shown you today, feel free to get that inside the AI success lab. Link in the
8:21:05
comments description. It is completely free and it comes with a community of 7,000 members where you can just share
8:21:13
what you're creating, learn from us, post in the community, etc. And it's completely free. Plus, it comes with all
8:21:19
my latest training, right? So, Claude 4 comes out, boom, shakalaka. I create three different trainings on exactly how
8:21:25
to use it, right, within hours. So, if you want to get the latest craziest stuff that's going on right now in the
8:21:31
AI world, feel free to get the AI success lab link in the comments description. It is completely free.
8:21:36
Again, if I had to pick one, I'm going with Claude 4 unless I need to create videos. And then Vea 3 is a go right
8:21:43
now. It's a go. And also, this comes with tons of other stuff. So, for example, like NA10 appointment setter
8:21:48
apps, AI super agents, short automations, etc. And we're constantly
8:21:55
giving away free trainings every single day inside the AI success lab. So, make sure you join before you miss out. And
8:22:00
if you want to get coaching help, support, if you want to get DM support, if you want to get weekly coaching calls
8:22:05
where you can learn how to implement this stuff, right? Because it's one thing knowing exactly how to use this
8:22:12
stuff. It's another thing knowing how do you implement it in your business, right? How do you use it to make money? How do you use it to to personalize and
8:22:19
automate the processes you have going on? That's what I recommend inside the AI profit boardroom because you can jump on there. It's community focused on
8:22:25
making money and saving time with AI. And you can see inside the community here, you can post questions and
8:22:31
actually get answers. You won't find that inside the AI success lab. You won't be able to get help inside the AI
8:22:36
success lab because everyone's just doing their own thing. The 7,000 people in there is too busy. Whereas the AI
8:22:41
profit boardroom, it comes with an awesome community of people just really serious about stuff, all working
8:22:48
together, working towards a goal, which is scaling the business, making money, and saving time with AI. comes with
8:22:54
courses and workflows that you will not find anywhere else, including how we've scaled our business using this crash
8:23:00
course and different automations you won't find anywhere. And additionally, inside the calendar here, you can jump
8:23:06
on coaching calls. We're going to jump this up to three coaching calls a week next month. And already you can jump on
8:23:13
the live calls, ask any questions you have. Plus, you can DM us if you need support, if you need help, and if you're
8:23:18
stuck on anything. So, this is the best place to get coaching and personalized support. Thanks so much for watching. Appreciate it. Link in the comments
8:23:24
description if you want to get this stuff and I will see you on the next one. Cheers. Bye-bye. Gemini 2.5 Flash preview. How to build anything and
8:23:31
automate anything. So today I'm going to show you all of the best ways to use Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview, which is a new
8:23:37
update from Google. Just got announced a few hours ago to build and automate almost anything that you can imagine.
8:23:43
All right, so we're going to get straight into this. The first way that you can actually start using Gemini is if you go to gemini.google.com.
8:23:50
Then you're going to select 2.5 flash and that will use the latest model to build whatever you want. Right? So for example here if we go inside Gemini now
8:23:57
and we're going to select canvas and this will allow us to not just build with flash but also to build apps with a
8:24:04
live preview. So let's go inside here. We'll use 2.5 flash. We'll select canvas and then we're going to say something
8:24:10
like okay create a drawing app for me. That's going to code it out. And once
8:24:16
it's ready it will also give you a live preview. So you can actually check this out as a live preview and code out
8:24:22
really fast. So you can see here we've got the simple drawing app and let's test it and make sure it works. We can
8:24:28
have a go and you can see that the drawing app works perfectly. You can change the color over here and we're
8:24:35
good to go on that. Not only this but with Gemini 2.5 Flash is really fast to build out and additionally you can
8:24:40
actually host it on a subdomain. So if we click on share in the top right then it's going to create a link for us. If we click on that link, we've now got the
8:24:48
sharable app ready to deploy and it's ready to go as you can see. So, let's just test this out. There we go. Drawing
8:24:56
app built in literally one click, one prompt, worked perfectly. Flash has got a lot better since its update today. It
8:25:04
seems to be faster, seems to be easy to use. And if you just want to code out stuff, I would recommend just going directly to gemini.google.com google.com
8:25:11
simply because you can get the live preview and it's quite easy to deploy stuff as a one click to make. Now if you
8:25:16
want to for example get the code for this you can go to
8:25:23
trial without canvas and then it will give you the code directly inside the chat as well. Next up one of the other
8:25:29
ways that you can start using this is inside AI studio and again this is a free way to get access to it. So you can
8:25:34
go to Gemini 2.5 flash preview in the top right under the settings. go to 2.5 then flash preview and then inside here
8:25:41
you can start coding. Now inside here as well you can also do like native image generation check out other apps you can
8:25:48
easily get the access to the API as well from Gemini and then we can start coding. So, for example, if we take a
8:25:56
prompt that I've just built with, we'll go to the history. We created this endless runner game using 2.5 flash
8:26:04
preview. And literally all we said was make me a captivating endless runner game. Key instructions on the screen, P5 JS, no HTML. I like pixelated dinosaurs
8:26:11
and interesting backgrounds. Coded that out perfectly, pretty quickly as well. And we were using the new thinking mode
8:26:17
from Gemini 2.5 Flash as well. And then if we go over to P5JS, editor.p5, p5
8:26:23
chess.org if you want to check this out. Paste this in, hit play, test this out,
8:26:29
and there we go. Game is working perfectly, right? And again, you can just build this out for free in one
8:26:35
prompt, one shot. Works really well. Gives you a little score. Has some decent UI. You can improve the UI, but
8:26:41
if you go back and forth with it, you're going to get better results. You can see exactly how to do it. So, just to recap here, you can build and deploy apps
8:26:47
using Gemini 2.5 Flash directly inside gemini.google.com. If you want to create code and then
8:26:53
preview it, so for example, this p5 js game, then you would create the code directly inside AI Studio and then go
8:27:00
over to p5js.editor.org and plug that code in and start playing it. Right? So those are two different
8:27:06
ways that we can use this. Additionally, what we can also do is we can go over to something like client. And by the way,
8:27:14
if you're wondering, okay, how do you set this stuff up or where are all the links, etc. How do you get access to all this stuff? You can just get access to
8:27:19
the full SAP on building and automating with Gemini directly inside the AI success lab link in the comments
8:27:25
description. Basically shows you how to build anything and automate anything with Gemini 2.5. And everything that I'm showing you today has been broken down
8:27:31
into step-by-step tutorials and guides so you can steal this stuff from me. All right, so let's go back into Visual
8:27:37
Studio Code over here. And then we're going to run a new task. And inside our extension client, we're going to go to
8:27:43
settings, open router, and we're going to select Gemini 2.5 flash preview from the options. Now, client have actually
8:27:50
officially confirmed that Flash, the new model is directly inside here. And you
8:27:57
can switch between different APIs as well directly inside the chat here. You can also use Google Chi 2.5 flash
8:28:04
preview thinking mode here as well. And then we can hit save on that. And from here, we can build whatever we want. So
8:28:10
for example, we say just something quick and basic to show you exactly what you can build. Let's say something like okay
8:28:17
build out a and we'll take some examples from the AI profit boardroom. link in
8:28:23
the comments in description if you want to join this community with coaching et etc on AI but we can say here okay
8:28:30
create beautifully designed snow day calculator SEO optimized for the keyword actual content on the page and relevant
8:28:35
tool right we'll go inside there and then we also say right make this
8:28:42
pink gradient fun emojis plus make it look sleek
8:28:48
modern and beautiful plus add FAQs like so. Then we can hit enter. Make
8:28:56
sure that you've got the right API selected. Hit enter and that's going to start coding out. What you can also do
8:29:02
is inside R code, if you paste the same sort of prompt, you can go inside here and you can click the AI button and that
8:29:08
will actually improve the prompt for you if you want to get better prompts or just make your prompts more detailed. But you see how it's basically instantly
8:29:14
building this out, creating the code for us. And we really didn't have to create much work there at all. Jose Pinto says,
8:29:20
"Good one." And that's building this out. Now, we're going to hit run command. We'll open that up. We've got
8:29:26
the SEO snow day calculator built out. Now, being 100% honest, the UI of this
8:29:31
does not look very nice. So, what I would normally do is either I'm going to be very patient and go back and forth
8:29:36
with Gemini Flash for ages. Or I can switch now to Anthropic. And then inside
8:29:42
Anthropic, Claw 3.5 Sonet. And then inside here we can say okay make the UI
8:29:48
more beautiful, sleek, modern, interesting. All right. And then Claude 3.7 Sonet is just a lot
8:29:56
better for improving the prompts and improving the UI on the actual code that
8:30:01
you build. All right. So that's what I'd recommend. Now we're going to close that because I've shown you how to build with
8:30:08
client. You've seen how to build with Gemini. You know how to build with AI Studio. What's next? What we can also do
8:30:15
is we can go over to NA10 and you can build out workflows with A10 using Flash
8:30:21
as well. So if we go inside NA10.io, this is a really powerful tool for building out automations. So for
8:30:27
example, like I've built out voice automation, Slack bots, all sorts of agents inside
8:30:34
N10. And if we go inside create workflow here, we'll just create a little basic
8:30:39
example. In fact, what I can do is yeah, create workflow.
8:30:45
Then we can put this as a chat trigger just to show you a really basic example what we can build. And then we're going
8:30:52
to add an AI agent. Inside the AI agent module, what you want to do is just add
8:30:58
chat model. And you could either use like Google Gemini chat model and create a new credential there. Or we can delete
8:31:06
that. So let's close that. And then inside here, we could select open
8:31:12
router. Open router. We can add a credential inside here. So, let me show you how to get that. You're just going
8:31:18
to go over to open router, select keys, create API key, type it in, copy that,
8:31:26
go over to NA10 again, paste in the API key, hit save, X off that, select the
8:31:33
model, and then you can use Gemini 2.5 flash preview 20. and also thinking
8:31:39
mode. If you be an agent and it doesn't require much thinking, you just want instant responses, then you should just
8:31:45
use flash preview and you're good to go on that. So, if we want to test this out, I'm just going to put some system
8:31:51
instructions inside the AI agent. So, let's say you're a helpful assistant and we'll say, okay, is 100* 40. It's
8:32:00
running the AI agent as you can see because it's flash. It's really good for building out AI agents. And then if we
8:32:06
open this up, it said, "Here's how to calculate 100 * 40. Here's what you do."
8:32:11
And then it's giving us the answer right there. All right. So that's how you can build AI agents as well. If you want to
8:32:17
just steal that example from me, I'll actually download the JSON and then inside the AI success lab link in the
8:32:24
comments completely free. You can download that JSON from me and you can grab the example agent and all your
8:32:29
agents that you use, you can just switch to flash if you want to as well just by changing the chat model that branches
8:32:36
off as you can see. So just to recap here, we've talked about Gemini and building apps directly in there. We've
8:32:42
talked about AI studio and how to code with that. We've talked about Visual Studio Code and how to code with that. And we've also talked about how to build
8:32:48
AI agents using NA10 as well. So you can see the power of this and how easy it is
8:32:53
to build out almost anything that you want using Gemini in this process.
8:32:59
Let's keep going now. So what we're going to do from here is we're going to start using something called Bolt DIY.
8:33:06
BoltDIY is like a offline version of Bolt where you can code with it directly
8:33:11
and you can also use Gemini Flash inside here. So, if you want to set this up quickly, pretty simple SAP inside the AI
8:33:18
success lab, which is completely free for you to get access. And if we go inside the instructions, we'll do a
8:33:26
direct installation. Paste that in. Then we'll PMP install that. And literally
8:33:31
all you're doing is just copy and paste in, right? It's pretty simple. And then we're just going to do that. Now, if we
8:33:38
need to pull in the latest model from Bolt, we can just grab this, we can plug
8:33:45
that into claw and say how to set up. And if you have any issues, like you see over here, we can just go back in here
8:33:51
and say, okay, help with this. And then we'll copy this. And what
8:33:57
that's going to do is start running BoltDIY locally so we can build with it. If we copy that local address, then
8:34:03
we'll open that up in a new tab. Now you can see we can start coding with bolt and if you select open router and then
8:34:09
you can choose Gemini 2.5 Pro preview here and just get access to 2.5 Pro
8:34:15
preview to start building stuff out. Right now you just need an API key. So
8:34:20
you can get that from open router. Let's go to keys in the top right. Create API
8:34:25
key. It's good practice is just give it a name you can actually remember and then we'll copy that code. Go back into
8:34:31
bolt. plug that in and say, "Okay, build a SEO calculator." Right? Something like
8:34:39
that. I'm just showing you basic examples for the video before anyone comments and saying, "This isn't that impressive," etc. And now that should
8:34:46
start coding out. Now, the only issue you're going to have with this is sometimes this runs a little bit slowly
8:34:53
depending on how fast your laptop is. But you can see it coding on the right hand side using Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview.
8:35:01
But again, you would just switch to flash preview if you want. So, we can switch to flash preview, which is the
8:35:08
latest model. And then we can say, okay, make the UI beautiful. And if we select
8:35:14
that text and then click on the AI section under here, it will actually improve the prompt so that we get better
8:35:20
outputs. So, let's wait for that to run. As you can see, then we're going to enter. And you can just improve it as
8:35:26
you want, step by step. does take a little bit of back and forth, but honestly the outputs worked first time round, so that's good as well. And then
8:35:32
if you ever want to shut this down, we could just quit the terminal, terminate that. We'll delete the API key, and
8:35:40
we're good to go on that. Right. So that's basically how you can build anything with Gemini 2.5 Flash, the new
8:35:45
version. So we've talked about client and Visual Studio Code. We talked about NA10, AI Studio, Gemini, etc. all the
8:35:52
SPS inside the AI success lab if you want to get free access to this plus an awesome community of 6,700 members that
8:35:58
you can ask any questions to. On top of that, if you want to get help, support,
8:36:03
tips, etc. implementing this stuff, feel free to get the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description. This
8:36:09
basically focuses on just more practical use cases and supports you with trying to implement this stuff. It can get
8:36:15
complicated. You're not sure how to use it. Maybe you need help and support actually implementing it and you're getting some bugs, etc. This is one of
8:36:21
the best places to go to help you support you on your journey towards using AI, saving time, making money with
8:36:27
AI, right? And you can also post inside the community. You can DM us. You can jump on the weekly live calls as you can
8:36:33
see inside the calendar. And also inside the classroom, we have tons of training on all different sorts of agents and our
8:36:39
crash course which is absolutely amazing for learning how we've actually implemented AI in our business to make
8:36:44
money. So feel free to get that link in the comments description. Price is going up next month. So, make sure you lock in your lifetime deal now and I will see
8:36:51
you on the next one. Cheers. Bye. Today, we're going to be talking about the new updates from Gemini 2.5 Flash. So, if
8:37:00
you've not seen this, Google announced some brand new updates for Gemini 2.5 Flash. You can see the benchmarks here in terms of how it performs, etc. This
8:37:07
has new capabilities, including native audio output and improvements to the live API. So the live API will actually
8:37:15
allow you to use a preview version of audio and visual input and native audio
8:37:21
out dialogue. So what does that mean? For example, what you can actually do is get outputs from the API when you're
8:37:27
coding using Gemini 2.5 Flash and it will actually talk to you. Let's run an example. model can converse in more
8:37:35
expressive ways and capture the really nuance power feet
8:37:41
and seamlessly switch to whisper. So you see how it's like switching between different tonalities, different
8:37:47
types of voices, etc. And this is inside the Gemini API and it will be available
8:37:52
later today as you can see. If you want to get access to the Gemini API, all you need to do is just go over to AI Studio
8:37:59
and you can get access to that stuff. So you see how it switches between like foreign languages, stuff like that's
8:38:05
basically one of the new features that you can get directly. So pretty crazy
8:38:10
stuff and it's absolutely amazing what you can do now. And if we keep going
8:38:16
through now, if you want to get access to this, let me show you exactly how. So if we go over to AI Studio, you can go
8:38:23
in the top right here and start using Gemini Flash Preview as you can see over here. And then from here you can start
8:38:30
coding, right? So for example, we take a example prompt. I'll take some examples from the AR profit boardroom just for
8:38:36
prompts and examples. So if we go to SAP section, then we're going to go to the master list of prompts. We'll just try
8:38:43
this one and see how it is. Now I don't know how good this API is. I just want to test it and see if it is any good or
8:38:49
not. So we're using the 0520 model as well. That's important to note. So you want to make sure that you selected 0520
8:38:56
in the outputs. and should be really fast as well when it's coming back to us.
8:39:02
So, it's also got thinking enabled inside there as well. So, you can switch between thinking and no thinking mode on
8:39:07
the right hand side. El Sweno Mexico says, "When is the price going to increase?" So, we'll probably increase
8:39:13
it next month. I think we'll get the coaching very soon and then we'll be doing the two coaching sessions inside
8:39:18
the AR profit boardroom twice a week, two to three times a week. If people want them every day, we can probably extend to that as well. main thing is
8:39:24
just making sure that you get the best training you possibly can inside the community and that you get value, right?
8:39:30
That's what the game is all about. So, make sure you sign up now. Link in the comments in description before you miss out on that. So, we're going to take the
8:39:36
code like and then what we can do is just preview that. So, let's go over to liveweave.com.
8:39:43
In fact, I think we just built that in p5 js, right? Let's have a look. Yeah, p5 js scene. Okay, let's go to that. Now
8:39:51
we're going to plug this in. And we'll hit play on that. There we go. We got Dino Runner. And that's what we've just
8:39:58
built. Pretty impressive that you can just build that out in one single prompt.
8:40:03
Honestly, I think the older version of Flash wouldn't have done that so well. And also, we just use that for free,
8:40:09
right? We didn't pay any money. I haven't got my credit card details plugged into AI Studio yet, but you can
8:40:15
just build this out. Pretty crazy. Now, for Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think, some
8:40:21
people asking questions about that. I don't think it's available publicly to try yet unless you're a trusted tester,
8:40:26
right? So, for example, if we go to the settings over here, Gemini 2.5, we won't find deep think mode as far as I can
8:40:33
see. Let's have a look here. Yeah, I can't see deep think mode inside here. If we go over to Gemini, we've got 2.5
8:40:40
Pro preview, but there's no Deep Think Mode. And Veo 2 is still in there for
8:40:46
some reason. So Veo3 has not been released inside there directly yet, but we can use 2.5 Flash and that is the new
8:40:53
model from Gemini. So there's two ways to use it. You can use it inside gemini.google.com. You can also use it
8:40:59
inside AI Studio. All right. So let's go back to our list of prompts and we'll
8:41:04
try another one now. So can you create a simple 3D car simulator? By the way, if you want like some actual money-m tips
8:41:10
for building this stuff, feel free to get the AR profit boardroom. But inside here, we're just going to plug in
8:41:15
another prompt. See what we get back. You can also switch on grounding with Google search, which will connect this
8:41:21
API to the internet as well when you're searching with it, which is pretty crazy. And now you can see that's coding
8:41:28
it out, right? The thing that's really the big differentiator here is number one, if you're coding at scale and you
8:41:34
do need to pay for the API at that point, then it's going to be a lot cheaper to build stuff out. So, I think you'll see a lot more apps and tools
8:41:40
being developed with it. but also it's going to allow audio output and input in
8:41:45
the API starting from later today. And additionally, it's really fast, right? So, it's a lot faster even when we've
8:41:51
toggled on the thinking mode of a flash preview. Just going to go back and start a new chat and then we'll try this out.
8:41:57
So, just make sure you do have pro preview selected. It's a flash preview
8:42:03
and then we just need to cope with that. All right. Now, if you want to get access to this as well, another paid
8:42:09
method is you can go over to models inside open router and then you'll see Gemini 2.5 flash preview plus 2.5 flash
8:42:18
thinking preview. Right? So, if we compare these three different options here, you can see that Gemini flash
8:42:24
preview thinking mode enabled, it's going to cost 15 cents per million input
8:42:29
tokens, right? And it's got a million token contacts window as you can see as
8:42:34
well. Now, if we go over to 2.5 flash preview with no thinking allowed, it's actually the same price. It says per
8:42:41
million input tokens, but for output tokens, it's a lot cheaper to use non-thinking mode, right? So, here you
8:42:48
can see it's $3.50 per million output tokens. Whereas, if
8:42:54
you go over to flash preview without thinking mode enabled, you can see here
8:42:59
it says 60 cents per million output tokens. So, it's 20% of the price. So, if we go over to our car simulator now
8:43:07
and we'll see how we're getting on now that in hit play. And that one actually
8:43:12
doesn't work. Right. So, when we've tested that, I think that's cuz it's not p5 js, right? If we go up. Yeah, it's
8:43:19
single. So, let's just test out inside LiveWeave and we'll see how that performs. Plug that in. Here's the
8:43:26
output. And that is the game built. Boom. Let's just make sure it works. So,
8:43:32
we can change the camera angle and we can drive the car. You can go backwards and forwards. Switch the camera angle.
8:43:41
We've got a train coming at us. Let's dodge that. Here we go. And now we'll keep driving forward. It's not the best
8:43:48
game ever created, but to be fair, it was free and it was easy to build and it did work first time round. So, fair play
8:43:54
to them. Now, another way you can use this is you can go directly inside the chat here. Honestly, if I'm building out
8:44:00
with Flash preview, then the way that I would build it out here is inside AI
8:44:06
Studio. If you want to code something a bit more impressive, then I would go over to Visual Studio Code. So, let's go
8:44:12
inside here. Go to Visual Studio Code and then we go down to a tool like
8:44:18
client or Root Code. We can start using this right now. One thing to note here is inside the AI success lab which is
8:44:25
completely free, you can get my full SOP on basically building and automating anything with Gemini 2.5. So if you want
8:44:32
to get all these different ways of coding and building stuff out, whether it's a browser use agent, make.com, n10,
8:44:38
client, etc. If you want to learn how to use client, you can get all the ps and the step-by-step instructions for
8:44:43
setting this stuff up. Like you can see right here, we've got full processes for everything, right? And that's inside the
8:44:48
AI success lab. So feel free to get that. It's completely free. Link in the comments description. So, as we go
8:44:53
through now, let's start building stuff out. We're going to open up. I'm just going to close copilot agent. Close
8:45:00
that. Okay, good to go. Let's go inside client. Then we're going to go inside the settings. We want to build for free,
8:45:06
right? So, if we want to build for free, we're going to select Gemini. And then over here, we'll go back to AI Studio. Grab the API key. Again, full SP. If you
8:45:14
want to slow this stuff down and just get the easy mode, you can just get it from the AI success lab, which is free.
8:45:20
And then we'll go back in here. We'll plug in the API key. We'll hit save on that. And then from here we can start
8:45:25
building out. Right? So if we say for example, okay, create sleek modern landing page
8:45:31
for SEO. Let's go with that. And then we just need to make sure in the model section of Google Gemini, we need to
8:45:37
select the latest model from Gemini. All right. So you can see
8:45:44
there's a bunch of options here. I can't actually see 2.5 flash preview the latest version
8:45:51
inside here. I just want to check Klein's Twitter. Sometimes they'll make an announcement if you can use it. So
8:45:57
let's have a look here. Yeah. So you can see here they've said Gemini 2.5 Flash0520
8:46:05
which is the latest model is live at Klein. This might be the best value you can use etc. So you can get access. So
8:46:12
if we go over to client let's have a look here. I think the way that you'd have to use it is actually use open
8:46:17
router to code with this inside client. So if we go to open router, you can get
8:46:22
an API key in the top right. Then we'll go back over to Visual Studio Code.
8:46:27
We're going to select open router. Then we're going to select 2.5 and I assume
8:46:33
you go with flash preview. So we hit save there. And then from there we can start building out. Then from here we
8:46:40
can run the command. So you can see how fast that is to build stuff out. Let's run the command here. Honestly, from
8:46:45
what I can see, that probably needs some improvement. So, I would go back inside
8:46:51
here and just be like, okay, make it beautiful,
8:46:57
sleek, modern, etc. But yeah, that's basically how you can build stuff out, right? So, you can use AI studio, you
8:47:05
can use Gemini, you can use inside client, etc. And it's all available to access. So, if you want
8:47:11
to get access to all of my best SAPs for using all the new Gemini updates, feel
8:47:17
free to get that inside the AI success lab. This comes with tons of automations, including like NA10 outbound appointment setters. This Slack
8:47:25
automation, we've got all these different updates coming every single day. So, make sure you don't miss out on
8:47:31
that. It's completely free inside the AI Success Lab community. Comes with 6,700 members as you can see right here. And
8:47:38
also if you want to upgrade, you want to get support, if you want to join a community more focused on making money
8:47:43
and saving time with AI, feel free to get that inside the AI profit boardroom comes with weekly coaching,
8:47:50
lots of support inside the community and also all of my best agents tips, templates, and workflows. So what we're
8:47:56
going to be testing now is Bolt DIY with Gemini 2.5 Pro. Now, if you want to set
8:48:01
this up, pretty simple inside the GitHub instructions, like you can see right here. So, you can actually use BoltDIY
8:48:08
and Gemini 2.5 Pro to build out your own apps. And you can do it for free using a
8:48:14
free API key and the latest version of Gemini 2.5 preview. So, let me show you exactly how to do this step by step. The
8:48:21
way that we're going to deploy this is we're going to use this inside terminal. So, I'm just going to open up terminal now. Let's plug this in. Here we go.
8:48:30
And you just copy the commands. Now if you get stuck with anything or you need to install any dependencies and you're
8:48:35
struggling then just copy and paste the whole stuff from terminal you can press Ctrl A and then Ctrl C and once you've
8:48:44
done that you can paste that into Claude and just ask for help set up like you can see we literally just copied and
8:48:50
pasted all the instructions from GitHub. Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to open this up on a new local tab like
8:48:56
you can see. And then what we're going to do is inside here we're going to
8:49:01
select Google and we shall select let's have a look here. All right. So you can
8:49:09
see here you can switch between the two. Now if you want to use Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental you select this one. You
8:49:15
can see $0 in $0 out. It's not going to cost you any money. If you want to use
8:49:21
2.5 Pro preview then you're going to pay for tokens right there. But again you can just switch to the free one if you
8:49:27
want. right here. Right. I'm going to use preview just show you the full power of this today. Now, what we're going to
8:49:32
do is we're going to go to a studio.google.com, get an API key, create an API key,
8:49:39
plug that in like you can see right here. And then we can copy that and plug it
8:49:46
directly into Bolt. Right? So, you see you've got this set up locally, which is great cuz then you can come back to the
8:49:52
projects and it is completely free to use Bolt DIY. Now, some people watch this and say it's not free. I've shown
8:49:59
you you can set up bold diy for free. And also, you're not paying for bolt new
8:50:04
this way because you're running this locally. All right, it's an open source thing, right? So, now what we can do is
8:50:09
we can plug in our API key over here. We're going to hit enter. And then from here, we can start running the code. So,
8:50:15
let's take one of these example prompts like this. So, for example, make
8:50:20
a space invaders game just to test is actually working. Just going to grab an API key from Open Routter. Copy that.
8:50:28
I'll delete these API keys after the live stream. So, we're going to grab an API key from Open Router to start using
8:50:33
preview inside here. We'll go inside Open Router here. Plug that in. Paste it in. There we go. And you can see it's
8:50:41
building it out. Right. So, we're using Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, which is the latest model. All right. Now, if you go
8:50:48
over to open router here and we go to models, you can see Gemini 2.5 Pro preview is
8:50:56
the latest update from Google Gemini and it was created on May December, 2025.
8:51:02
Right. So, that's the main one that we're using here. And then if we go back, we can see it's coding it out
8:51:07
right now. The main benefit of using Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview is that it tends to be better than building stuff. for
8:51:13
example, you can use Claude, for example, but Claude is just nowhere near as good from what I've seen. And the main reason for that is like Claude is a
8:51:20
lot slower when you're coding stuff out. Whereas Gemini, it seems to be a lot faster, is pretty cheap or is completely
8:51:27
free if you use the ways I've shown you today. And you can see it literally works like full first time. It's
8:51:32
absolutely crazy. So, let's start building some ideas out. Now, that was just like a simple experiment. and we're
8:51:39
going to go inside here and just plug in your niche and then get some ideas, right? So, if I say, "Okay, give me some
8:51:46
fun ideas for creating simple apps for my SEO
8:51:52
agency." We'll grab this. So, that's going to give us some ideas. So, for example, like the backlink builder tycoon game.
8:52:00
We'll go into bolt new. We'll plug that in. We'll say build this. And I'm just
8:52:06
going to say, give me a simple demo. I can test.
8:52:12
No need to build out the full game yet. Right. So, basically what we've done here is we've taken our industry, our
8:52:18
niche, got a bunch of ideas for building games and apps using that niche, and
8:52:24
then we've plugged that into Bolt DIY. We're using Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview Plus
8:52:30
Bold DIY to build this out, right? Like you can see. So, if we hit enter like so, that should start doing its magic
8:52:36
now. And you can see it's just coding itself out. And there we go. Boom.
8:52:42
Game is done. Right now, what you could also do is you can say, okay, turn this idea into a 3JS runner game. Wait for
8:52:50
that response. And again, you can get everything that you've built on the left hand side here.
8:52:56
And then also if you want to preview this, you can actually open it up in a
8:53:02
separate tab like you can see. So you just click this popup button over here.
8:53:07
So there we go. I'm just going to say make sure the preview works and we'll
8:53:12
see what we get back. So now we've got the outputs of the game. Obviously
8:53:17
that's like the basics, right? The raw sort of files. So, what I'm going to say now is add more detail to the game,
8:53:25
make it more interesting, add some core backgrounds, etc., right?
8:53:31
Make it feel more immersive. And then what you can also do is you can copy that and if you
8:53:37
see this bit at the bottom, this is the AI prompt generator. So, if we click on enhance the prompt, what that can do is
8:53:44
just improve the prompt so it's got more bit more detail. All right. The other thing you can do as well is if that just doesn't work like you can see right
8:53:50
here, then you can just go into chat GBT and just say okay, improve this prompt
8:53:57
for bolt DIY like you can see. All right. Now, as you're doing that as
8:54:04
well, if we click on enter, so we can just go back and forth and build out the
8:54:10
app step by step. So, you can see the AI preview. Now, this is like the improved version of it. I'm also wondering if we
8:54:17
can code two things at the same time. Last time I checked, he couldn't with bolt DIY, but let's see if you can now.
8:54:22
So, if we go back here to the main section, we'll take the next
8:54:28
idea in a second. Now, that actually if you code two things out at the same time, seems to break it. So, you can see
8:54:34
here this is stop coding now with no preview. So, just something to bear in
8:54:40
mind there. So, you can't build two things at the same time. So now we'll wait for the anchor text game to roll
8:54:46
out. See what we can build here. This actually seems to have stopped for a
8:54:52
second here. So I'm just going to stop the terminal, which is good for you
8:54:58
to see if you're not sure how to fix this. So you can see here that it's actually broken on us. I'm just going to switch that back on
8:55:04
now. We'll just PM install that. Then we'll go again. I just need to check my
8:55:11
credits as well on open router. Yeah, we're all good to go there. Now, this might be because of a
8:55:19
limit on the Gemini 2.5 Pro updates. So, if you are struggling between them, you
8:55:25
can just switch through here. So, if one API stops working, you can actually change the API inside the drop down here
8:55:31
if you're struggling at any point. All right. And there we go. We've got the anchor text match game ready to go. So
8:55:38
we can drag and drop like it gives us the idea or whether it's incorrect or correct. So if we take best SEO to tools
8:55:44
and drag it to top SEO software correct match boom we've got it right now. If you want to improve the UI etc. This is
8:55:50
super basic. It's always going to build out like a basic prototype and then you can create something more interesting
8:55:56
like you can see right here. So we got two out of five. So if we go back inside here and we'll say okay make the design
8:56:05
more modern, sleek, interesting, put your lingo style and then we'll enter
8:56:13
and just swipe code it to a better prototype. Again, if this just stops working like
8:56:19
you can see, we can switch to pro experimental. Then we'll say continue and you can just switch between them. So
8:56:26
there you go. You can see it's working now. does seem to have a rate limit. So, just bear with it, right? Especially if you're using the free APIs. Like, it
8:56:33
might take a little bit of time, but that's the price you pay, isn't it? You can either have it cheap or you can have
8:56:39
it fast. Started trying to create sound effects for some reason, but I told it not to. So, that's why it's bouncing
8:56:45
around now and just changing a few things. The other option that you have with Gemini is you don't just have to
8:56:52
use bolty as well. So, another option is you can just go over to Firebase, right? So,
8:56:58
for example, if Bold DIY is struggling, maybe you're trying to build something more complex or you need a bit more
8:57:03
guidance like a proper app sort of process, then you can go over to Firebase. And this is actually quite
8:57:09
impressive now with Gemini 2.5 Pro. Plus, it is free to use. So, I'm just
8:57:14
going to show you some examples and I'll delete these. So, if we go over to here and we're like, okay, create this. So,
8:57:22
we'll copy that idea from Chat GPT. Click on create this.
8:57:27
This is like another bolt new alternative that's completely free
8:57:32
as long as you only do 10 workspaces at a time. And the cool thing about this is it will actually give you like a
8:57:38
briefing document to approve first. So for example, you got the SEO myth busters features down here, style
8:57:44
guidelines, etc. We'll click on prototype this app. And then all we need to do
8:57:50
is just go back. I'm just going to delete that API key. One sec. So, if we go to AI Studio,
8:57:57
grab the API key from there. So, we can get a free one. Copy that.
8:58:03
Go over here. This is going to ask us in a sec for an API key. So, we'll just wait for this to
8:58:09
code out. So, you can see it's built out the blueprint. Here's the name of the app, SEO Mythbusters. It's going to
8:58:14
include quiz questions, feedback, interactive UI, email capture, and results summary. Now, it's coding it
8:58:21
out. What you can also do as well is for example the email capture stuff. If
8:58:26
you're not bothered about that then you can say don't worry about the email capture. But you can see here now it's coded out the app. So we got SEO
8:58:32
mythbusters. UI is pretty nice and clean. Let's just test it out. And then if we actually plug in API key over
8:58:38
here. So let's copy that. Go back here. Plug that in inside here. We can use the
8:58:44
AI API key to generate responses inside the app. Right? So for example, if we put keyword stuff in helps improve SEO
8:58:51
rankings, that's false obviously, then it's generating the feedback and that should be using the API key from Gemini
8:58:59
that we just plugged in over here. All right, so it's another way to build apps. To be honest, like the outputs nowadays, as you can see, like the
8:59:06
outputs are probably nicer directly inside Firebase Studio versus using Bold
8:59:11
DIY. But if you prefer to code locally, then you're going to use Bold DIY, right? This is another one. So it's
8:59:18
called White Hat Defender, a Black Hat SEO defense game. Let's prototype that out as well. And you can
8:59:26
build two apps side by side, right? So whilst you're waiting for one to code, you can build out the other one. And
8:59:31
then also inside here, you can switch to code. So you can actually get all the files from the document.
8:59:39
You can hit publish on that as well. So if we click publish, right, like so, we're good to go on that. But yeah, you
8:59:46
can see there's many different ways to build out apps, tools, games, etc. So,
8:59:51

9:00:28
Pro update is absolutely insane. So, Google just dropped this new Google Gemini 2.5 Pro preview update, and it's
9:00:35
an absolute gamecher for building apps. Like you can see right here, you can build apps, tools, games. I'm going to
9:00:40
show you exactly how to do that and you can do it in seconds completely for free if you follow the methods that I'm going
9:00:46
to show you today. You see, I built all of this stuff plus much more on the video. And in this video, you're going
9:00:51
to get the prompts, the walkthrough, and the secret stack I use to deploy apps instantly. Additionally, on top of that,
9:00:57
you're going to learn how to find viral tools using Google and Gemini's hidden gems feature. And I'll show you how I
9:01:03
built five insane AI tools live from a medieval siege simulator to a guitar trainer, all from one line of text. and
9:01:10
you'll discover why Gemini 2.5 Pro is destroying other models in speed, app
9:01:15
quality, and creativity. And you'll learn how to turn these tools into money. Let's go. So, today we are going
9:01:22
to be testing out Gemini 2.5 Pro. So, the first thing that we're going to look at is Gemini. Now, Gemini have launched
9:01:30
Gemini 2.5 Pro, as you can see right here, and it is a new update that just came out a few days ago. Now, if you
9:01:36
haven't tested it already, you can actually access it for free inside AI Studio if you go in the top right and
9:01:42
then click Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview. And additionally, inside Gemini, you can
9:01:47
build some absolutely awesome apps. So, for example, here you can see that we can easily build out, for example, like
9:01:54
this drawing and a lot of this stuff just works perfectly first time round. So for example, if we want to change
9:02:00
colors, draw a little smiley face right there. We can easily do that and the creativity
9:02:07
is pretty much unlimited. Now the other cool thing is you can keep the app ideas really simple. So if you say for example
9:02:13
just build an app where I can draw in different colors, it will just go off and work its magic like you can see right here using the Gemini 2.5 Pro
9:02:21
preview option. Again, you can use this for free inside Gemini 2.5 Pro preview
9:02:26
mode on AI Studio. But either way, you can access for free and it's super powerful for coding. It's way better
9:02:33
than it used to be. And also, you can build out, for example, like different apps, games, etc. So, for example, here
9:02:38
we created dragon flight. We said build a 2D dragonfly simulator with fire
9:02:43
breath and enemy villages. Let users fly a dragon around a fancy world map. Brief fire and dodge arrows, right? We include
9:02:49
like the commands as well. So, spacebar to breathe, fire, etc. And if we click on start game here, we can now start
9:02:56
going off and destroying villages as a dragon.
9:03:02
We've also got a hellfire right there. Reminds me of like when you were playing a Mega Drive and stuff like that. And that is not a bad game for a one-shot
9:03:08
prompt at all. It's one of the only apps I've actually seen with Gemini where it can actually build first time round. For
9:03:13
example, if you are using Claude, etc., it's either going to take too long or it's going to break first time round.
9:03:19
Whereas, for example, with this, you can just easily build out whatever you want and you just give it like one prompt.
9:03:25
Most of the time, it will just go off and do its magic. So, it's pretty amazing what it can do and how it can do it. Here's another example. So, this is
9:03:31
a brainwave visualizer. Actually has audio, but I muted it just cuz I don't want to blow your speakers or something
9:03:36
like that. So, let's click on for example here and you can see we can
9:03:41
visualize different waves. So, this is a brain wave visualizer. We can click these buttons to simulate different
9:03:46
mental states, right? So, for example, the meditate wave will actually calm down the waves. Focus mode, change it to
9:03:52
that. Sleep mode, you've got an example. And there's stress as well. So, you can see how the brain waves are visualized
9:03:57
here. And how easy it is to set this up and just get started with it, right? So, if you want to build like anything that
9:04:03
you want, really, you just want to come up with different ideas. Now, if you're not sure what to build, what you can actually do is you can just go on to
9:04:09
chat GBT and say just give me 10 ideas
9:04:15
for apps I can build and then either put in your niche, your industry, your
9:04:21
business or what you're interested in. Right? So, for example, if I'm interested in guitar for example, right?
9:04:27
Give me some app ideas plus the prompts. We can say something
9:04:34
like that. And then chat GPT is really good for coming up with the ideas. And from there
9:04:39
you can start building out what if you want. So for example here we've got an idea. So we'll grab that. And then we'll go back to Gemini. Again you can do this
9:04:46
inside AI Studio as well. And then you can plug in this. Select canvas. So you can actually preview the HTML as you
9:04:51
code it. And you can also have like multiple different apps being built at the same time. So if we open up another tab here and then we're going to go back
9:04:59
in here and we'll say okay interactive guitar trainer. So, we'll plug that into another tab on Gemini. Hit enter. And
9:05:07
now we can just build out multiple apps. And all we need is the idea, which we didn't even come up with. We got AI to
9:05:12
automate that, too. So, it's pretty amazing what you can do and how you can do it. And you know how easy it is and
9:05:17
how powerful it is. So, here's another one. And again, this works for any industry, any niche, any idea, etc., as
9:05:24
long as you keep it relatively simple. It's also got this explore gem section as well, which is quite interesting
9:05:29
inside Gemini now as well. So you can see some ideas of what gems have been built. These are pre-made ones. You can
9:05:35
also create your own gems. So you can save stuff that you've created, which is pretty cool as well. But if we go back to our app, as you can see, it's start
9:05:45
to build that out. Same with this one. And it really doesn't take long at all.
9:05:50
Now, if you want to build something a little bit more complex, here's another example of a more detailed prompt. I actually created this inside AI Studio.
9:05:58
This is a much longer prompt, like you can see. And also I just wanted to show that you can do this for free as well. So if you go inside Google AR studio and
9:06:05
you say something like create a single file HTML and JavaScript app simulating a medieval siege using 2D physics
9:06:11
include a dragon catapult destructible castle walls made of bricks and soldiers that react when hit. Add sliders control
9:06:17
the launch speed angle wind include battle effects and sound effects. Right. And so we've got all the code right
9:06:22
here. And then what we can do from there is if we copy that code and if you're using AR studio and you want to preview
9:06:29
the code, just ask it to generate the HTML like we did inside our prompt over here. And then if you go over to
9:06:35
LiveWeave, we'll delete that. Delete this. Plug that code in there. And now we've got the app ready to preview. All
9:06:43
right. I'm just going to mute the tab so that it doesn't again blast out loads of music. And we can change the angle, the
9:06:49
launch speed, etc. of the catapult, the wind, and this should work like you can see. So, if we change the angle now,
9:06:58
then we'll reduce the speed. There we go. And we can just change
9:07:03
and do whatever we want with it, right? So, it's pretty easy to build this stuff out. Now, if you have any changes, for
9:07:08
example, like this, you can just go back into AI Studio and say, okay, add a score plus timer to the game to make it
9:07:16
more interesting. We're at command and enter on a Mac and then that's going to start recoding out
9:07:22
the tool. As you can see now, it's also triggered thinking mode inside AI Studio
9:07:28
using the Gemini preview. And again, you can see here that it does have token limits, but you
9:07:34
can use it for free inside AI Studio. So, I don't have, for example, my credit card details plugged in here and it
9:07:40
would just go off and generate it. The other thing that I would say is it's super fast, right? So if you try and do the same thing inside Claude, Claude is
9:07:46
quite slow when it's generating stuff. So if we go over to Claude, which is probably the second best competitor, and
9:07:53
if we go over to Claude here, we'll plug in the same prompt. It typically tends
9:07:58
to take a lot more time to actually code out the tool or the game that we're trying to build. So that's just something to bear in mind there, too.
9:08:04
The other cool thing you can do as well is if you go over to Open Router, inside open router, you can grab the API key
9:08:11
inside the model section. So if you scroll down, go to Gemini 2.5 Pro preview. You want to make sure that you
9:08:17
check the date before you use this API. So you can see here that it is created on May the 7th and then you can either
9:08:24
use this inside the chat or you can grab an API key inside open router as well and then use that to code. So for
9:08:29
example, if we go to Visual Studio Code, we can start coding with that inside
9:08:35
client or root code or whatever we want. Right? So if we go to settings over here and then go to open router plug your API
9:08:42
key select the model you want then we'll select 2.5 pro preview
9:08:48
hit save and we can start coding like that as well. So if we go back to the prompt that we used inside AR studio
9:08:56
grab that plug this into Visual Studio Code like you see and then we can go off
9:09:02
and start using this. Now, if you don't know how to set up, for example, any of these tools that I'm using or you need
9:09:09
some help or you know, you're struggling or want some ideas or prompts or want to meet people in the same niche as you, etc., then feel free to get the AI
9:09:15
profit boardroom link in the comments description. Basically, in the AI profit boardroom, we built an awesome community
9:09:21
where you can learn how to make more money and save time and automate using AI. It's an awesome community, super active, tons of great posts in there,
9:09:28
tons of courses and classrooms and templates and also weekly Q&A calls which you can jump on and ask any
9:09:34
questions you have like you see right here. So, if we go back now, we've got the next preview of our code ready to
9:09:41
go. We can click the copy mode and we'll go back to LiveWave. And if you want to
9:09:48
preview this, let's do that. So, I'm just going to refresh the page.
9:09:54
Plug this in. And there we go. We've got a score and a timer. Right now, let's have a look at some of the apps we just
9:10:00
coded a second ago. So, this is the guitar chord visualizer. Like you can see right here,
9:10:06
I can confirm the A minor chord is correct. As a guitar player myself, we can actually play the
9:10:13
sound and we can toggle dark mode as well, which is pretty cool. And also, if you want to share this stuff that you've
9:10:18
created, you can just copy the link and then you can see this will be hosted on a subdomain inside gemini.google.com.
9:10:24
But it's absolutely amazing what you can do now. So easy to do. You can flick between the chords. You can build whatever apps you want. Here's another
9:10:31
example. So this is the guitar fretboard quiz and then it will ask you, okay, like what's the notes, etc. Really for
9:10:37
learning the guitar. So yeah, anything that you want to build. Now, you're not just limited to, for example,
9:10:44
building out. Look at this. This is the output from Claude. Look how bad that is
9:10:50
compared to the output that we got previously from Gemini, right? It's just nowhere near as good.
9:10:57
It's all It's really buggy. It's messing up right there. Doesn't
9:11:03
make any sense. Whereas you use something like Gemini Studio and you're absolutely living the dream. If we have a look at the rankings, let's have a
9:11:09
look where we're up to in terms of the rankings. So you can see Pro Experimental just got launched this week and it's already working its way up the
9:11:15
rankings. But honestly, if I compare all of these models, I'm easily going to say that Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental is the
9:11:22
best out of all of them. Now, if we go back to for example Visual Studio Code
9:11:30
is using the MCP, but essentially we can select here Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview and then use that to generate outputs as you
9:11:37
can see. So pretty easy and simple. The other one that I really like to code with is Root Code. So if you go over to
9:11:43
Root Code 3.16, it's just been released actually, which is interesting. And then inside here, we can start coding with
9:11:49
that too. We just need to make sure that we've got open router selected. And then we'll select Gemini 2.5 Pro preview.
9:11:56
Honestly, actually to be fair, like they've improved the UI a lot on Root Code. I would say it's probably better
9:12:02
now, especially if you look at the settings. Like it just looks a lot nicer. So if we hit done, then we're
9:12:07
going to go inside here. We'll plug that in and we can start going off and coding. Additionally, if you look at the
9:12:13
web dev arena leaderboard, you can see here the AI is absolutely crushing it. So, Gemini 2.5 Pro preview is right at
9:12:21
the top and only just got launched this week, which is crazy. And then you can see Claude 3.7 Sonic is below
9:12:29
it, right? So, for development, for coding, etc., Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview is
9:12:34
absolutely crushing it. Now the other cool thing that you can do if you want to figure out okay like what tools can I
9:12:40
create etc in your niche and you can go on to hrefs and you can type something for example like SEO and then type in
9:12:46
tool or calculator etc. So you put in your niche and then tool or calculator whatever you want go inside here and you
9:12:53
can see what people are searching for so you can figure out okay people are looking for these tools so I can go off and build them and then share them on
9:12:59
the web and either rank them or create them and they're more likely to be used by other people as well right and that's how you can monetize them. So for
9:13:05
example like white label SEO tool, SEO tracking tool, rank checkers etc. These
9:13:10
would do really well if you built out a tool using Gemini. Additionally, you can do the same inside Google here. So if we
9:13:16
type, for example, let's say your niche is SEO, you can type in SEO tool and then just see what people are creating,
9:13:22
that sort of thing. So there you go. So if you want to replicate this stuff yourself and do it all for free, do it
9:13:27
inside AI Studio, create the code, then go to liveweave.com and from there go
9:13:33
off and do it. Now, if you want like full in-depth tutorials for all the stuff that I'm talking about, then feel free to get the AI profit boardroom link
9:13:40
in the comments description inside the SAP section, you'll see like we have step-by-step instructions on how to do
9:13:46
everything that we show you, right? So, for example, you got Gemini 2.5 Pro and how to use it step by step right there.
9:13:52
We got notebook LM and this gets updated every single day. So, like the value of the AI profit boarding improves every
9:13:58
single day. The other final thing that I was going to say with the new upgrade is that you can actually use Gemini 2.5 Pro
9:14:05
inside Firebase as well to create your own apps. Right now, this just got launched this week as well. So, it was
9:14:10
previously running with 2.0 Flash, which is not very good to be honest. Gemini 2.5 Pro is a lot better when it comes to
9:14:17
AI from Google. And then inside here, you can just create whatever app you want. So, if we took an example like
9:14:24
this, we'll take that. We'll plug this in here. And then we're going to say okay colors equal and then I'll put my
9:14:32
brand colors. We'll plug that in prototype with AI and it will start
9:14:37
going off and giving us a app blueprint. All right. So for example, color scribbler drawing canvas color palette
9:14:42
color selection clear all option and then we can prototype the app. We've got the color ideas right here. So primary
9:14:49
color background color and accent. You can change those if you want to. And then if we click on prototype this app,
9:14:55
we can just go off and start building. And then if we go back to the game that
9:15:00
we created with Visual Studio Code, you can see that's coded right here. The AI
9:15:05
told us, right, I've created the single file HTML.js. Medieval Siege game is requested. It includes a drag war
9:15:11
catapult, destructible walls, etc. And then we've opened that up and we can see that inside our browser right here.
9:15:18
Right. So, let's try this out. There we go. And there you go. It's easy to build
9:15:23
out games and that sort of thing. I honestly think the outputs are typically better directly from AI Studio than they are from Visual Studio Code. But the
9:15:31
difference here is like with Visual Studio Code, you're building locally, right? You're not building like online
9:15:37
in somewhere where you know your data is shared and that sort of thing. Here's another one that we built. So this was a
9:15:42
random idea for startups. So random startup idea generator. And then if we
9:15:48
click generate idea, we can get a bunch of ideas right here. Right. So let's go back to Firebase. See what we got here.
9:15:54
Okay. So, it's building out the blueprint.md beginning to code out. You can code
9:15:59
multiple projects at once. You are limited on the free plan to 10 workspaces at a time. So, that's the
9:16:05
maximum that you can build out. And then it's creating the project right here.
9:16:11
So, you can see between using Gemini, AI Studio, Firebase, Visual Studio Code,
9:16:17
etc. It's so easy to build stuff out and create like really awesome projects using Gemini Pro. And to be honest, like
9:16:24
I don't think any of the other AIs even compare at this point. Like I'm sure if Claude Sonic 4 comes out or Deep Sea Car
9:16:31
2 comes out, maybe they'll be on the same level, but Google have gone from absolute nowhere. I remember trying Bard
9:16:37
and it was terrible to something like this where it's unbelievably good. It's probably the best in the world,
9:16:42
especially for coding. So here we have the color scribbler. You can see it
9:16:48
works perfectly. So we'll clear all. There we go. Beautiful drawing. Picasso
9:16:54
lever. And then you can see that we can easily get that app working. Right. How
9:17:00
long did that take? No time at all. Right. If you actually want to make it an app, then you can click the link here
9:17:06
and copy the preview URL or you can just scan that on your phone. And then if you scan it on your phone, you've got the
9:17:11
app ready to test and preview yourself. So it's absolutely awesome game changer.
9:17:17
Totally changed everything for AI. And it's crazy how quick these updates come out. So, thanks so much for watching. If
9:17:22
you want to get all my best prompts, tips, templates, workflows, AI agents, automations, make.com automations, NA10
9:17:29
templates, etc., and even the videos on how I create AI avatars as well, then

9:18:44
breaking news, you can now build AI apps with Gemini 2.5 Pro for free in Firebase
9:18:50
Studio. And it changes everything for app builders. What if I told you that the world's best AI app builder is now
9:18:56
100% free and it just got 10 times more powerful. Today, I'm going to show you
9:19:02
how. This completely free tool just crushed paid alternatives in my live test. and I'll show you how to build
9:19:08
fully functional apps with one prompt, one shot. And yes, I'm going to test it against paid tools like Bolt and
9:19:15
Lovable. And let's see who gets destroyed. Watch me create a financial dashboard, quiz game, and SEO roast
9:19:21
generator that actually works in one shot. And the best part is you don't need to code, and it's free. This might be the best app building AI tool, and
9:19:28
it's available right now. Let's go. We have a brand new update from Gemini 2.5
9:19:35
Pro with Firebase Studio. So now you can build better apps. Now this previously
9:19:42
was not that impressive. I'll be 100% honest with you. So Firebase Studio is very similar to for example things like
9:19:50
Bolt. New Lovable. You can build your own apps here. The biggest difference here is that it's completely free to
9:19:56
use, right? So, if you want to use this, you can build apps like you can see right here, this tip splitter app that
9:20:01
I've actually built previously. We've got a fridge chef app built as well.
9:20:07
This was a financial overview app, which is pretty cool. And then, additionally, we have their SEO ROI calculator as an
9:20:15
example, right? All looking pretty clean and tidy. All built for free using the app generator in Firebase. Right now,
9:20:24
this is actually much better since I've tested it with Gemini 2.5 Pro. The problem before was it was actually using
9:20:30
Gemini Flash. And if you know anything about Google Flash, Gemini Flash, it's not that impressive for coding, whereas
9:20:36
now it's a lot more powerful. So, this just got announced literally like yesterday. And they've basically said
9:20:42
Gemini 2.5 Pro is now available inside Firebase Studio, which is absolutely
9:20:48
awesome for building stuff out. It's one of the best coding tools you can get out there and also it's completely free. All right, so we're going to get straight
9:20:55
into this. You can get access to Firebase Studio at firebase.studio.
9:21:00
Then once you're on the homepage here, you can see some examples of what you can build, how you can build it, etc.
9:21:05
It's really simple. You don't need to be able to code to be able to build your own apps. And if you ever had an app idea, it's incredibly easy to get
9:21:12
started. So you see some examples of sample prompts. You can also import a
9:21:17
repo. So you can import a git repo. You can set up a new workspace. And you can also choose between the different types
9:21:23
of apps you build. So for example, it could be like go, python, flask, java.net,
9:21:29
Android studio cloud, flutter, etc. So let's get straight into this. To build
9:21:35
this one, this was actually just a one example. So basically I just said a tipping calculator
9:21:42
built to help calculate tips on a bill's friends. Use a pink and purple color scheme. They said, "Okay, here's the
9:21:48
plan. Here you go." And it literally built it in one shot. Right. So, that is
9:21:54
the app built in one single shot. It was incredibly easy to do. Didn't take long at all. And you can see how it can be
9:22:02
done. All right. So, if you want to get started with this stuff, let me show you exactly how. So, first thing you want to
9:22:08
do is actually come up with some ideas. Now, if you're not sure, okay, what sort of ideas can you build? What could you
9:22:14
create, etc., I would recommend just going on to chat GPT and asking it. Right? So for example, you can go into
9:22:20
chat GPT and say, "Okay, I have a SEO
9:22:25
agency business. Give me three simple app ideas
9:22:30
quick to build and fun." So for example, like the backling bouncer game right
9:22:36
now, what we can do is if we go over to Firebase Studio, we can take a very similar prompt to the one for the
9:22:42
tipping calculator. So, let's copy that and then we'll go inside Firebase Studio here. We're going to say, okay, a
9:22:48
backlink quiz app to and then just explain what you want it to do. So, you
9:22:54
explain what you want it to do and then also the color scheme here. So, for example, use a pink and purple color
9:23:00
scheme. So, we can plug that in and start building out. So, now it's come
9:23:05
back to us with the app blueprint. So for example, link value guesser. It
9:23:11
displays two different backlinks side by side. Backlink selection, SEO value analysis, result feedback, and score
9:23:16
tracking. And then you've got the color scheme right here. So you can actually click on these. And then also it's got
9:23:22
the layout, typography, and iconography. Right? So you've got the style guidelines. Then you've also got the features and you have the name. So it's
9:23:29
really simple. Like you don't need to be able to code to build this stuff. Now, one caveat that I'm going to say to this is if you're building something new and
9:23:35
untested, something like this for example where it's a
9:23:40
little bit more complicated. It's not just like a calculator then it can go wrong. So just something to bear in mind there is it's not always guaranteed to
9:23:47
work in the one shot. But let's test it out and click on prototype this app and see what we get back. So if you're
9:23:52
wondering okay like how long does this take to generate? Let's put the timer on. We'll see how long this takes. So
9:23:57
it's building it out right now. I think what it's also going to do is ask me for a Gemini API key. Now you can click on
9:24:05
autogenerate when it asks you but quite often that doesn't work. So if you want to generate a API key that's completely
9:24:12
free just go to a studio.google.com then go to get API key then create an
9:24:18
API key and you can just generate one for free and also once you've generated one you can click on the API key you
9:24:25
want to select and then copy it later. So let's see what it's doing is creating the MV the docs the blueprint etc. So in
9:24:32
the meantime whilst we're waiting for that to load let's have a look at what we've built here and whether it actually works. So for example let's say the bill
9:24:38
amount is 100 and the tip amount is 20%. We don't want to go on who's tipping 5%.
9:24:44
What sort of savage what sort of cheapkate is tipping 5%. All right so we'll go with 20%. And then number of
9:24:50
people here we'll put three. You can see here that you do need to change like the
9:24:55
UI. So white on a purple background doesn't look great there. I would change that. But you can see here how easy it
9:25:02
is to actually make sure it works, right? And this was built in one shot. We hit reset. We can just go back to the
9:25:08
default. Let's check out the fridge chef. So, I'm going to put here chicken
9:25:14
rice. What can we make? We'll hit find recipes. See what we get back. So, you can see here it says it appears your app
9:25:21
needs a Gemini API key. I plug that in. It updated it. And then we've got the details right here. And that's generated
9:25:27
a recipe literally in one click. So, we clicked on find recipes and it worked perfectly. We got a simple chicken and
9:25:33
rice recipe. We're good to go on that, my friends. All right. How easy was that? The biz insight one is super
9:25:38
interesting as well. So, you can like add appointments here. You can add transactions and then it will calculate
9:25:45
the financial overview, right? So, it's going to give you total revenue, total expenses, net profit, etc. Really easy
9:25:50
for just managing your finances. And again, we build that in one shot. One take, Drake. The SEO ROI calculator.
9:25:57
We're good to go on that as well. And that was really easy and simple to do. So, if we go back to the link value
9:26:05
calculator here, you see how it says enter your Gemini API key? I'm just going to plug that in in the background.
9:26:12
And then we can just paste that in. So, I'm going to have to delete that after the live stream, but you get the point.
9:26:19
Now, you can see there's an issue here. So, if you have any issues, just click fix error and then you can get that
9:26:24
fixed. And the API key is free. So, I've not been charged for that. It's free on AI Studio up to a certain point. You
9:26:31
can't use the limits too much, but yeah, you can get it for free. And then if you upgrade or if you're on the paid tier,
9:26:37
then obviously you get higher token limits. So, you know, if it was a big SAS tool that you rolling out to
9:26:42
millions of people, of course, you're going to pay. But if it's just something you're building for yourself or sharing with a few friends, then you don't need
9:26:49
to pay for that. It is free. So, we've got that good to go right here. We can also copy the link for this. So we can
9:26:55
actually share it with people and you can make a preview public, right? So if we for example give people this preview,
9:27:02
they can scan it, open it up on their phone and then test out the app right there, which is pretty cool. What's also
9:27:07
cool here is you can vibe code it, right? So for example, if you click on the select section here, you can select
9:27:14
the element that you want to change. So for example, if we go to the tip splitter, we can click on this. Then
9:27:21
we're going to click on the section we want to change and we can choose okay which element do we want to fix it and
9:27:27
just vibe code out. So let's click on for example this and then we can say get
9:27:33
recipes not find recipes just as a simple example to show you what you can do. Usually as well when I'm coding
9:27:39
these out I don't really choose coding language. I just go with the basic one right for example here I let it auto
9:27:46
select based on the app that I want to build. But you can see here how we've fixed this to say get recipes now
9:27:52
instead. So that's all fixed. Now we choose which one we want. So for example, neil patel.com or Samrush.
9:27:59
Which one do you want? I'm going to go with Neil Patel. And then it gives us the results right there. Right. So we
9:28:04
got the results on the quality of the link. It gives us the AI reasonings. Like both backlinks are really good, but
9:28:10
backlink from Semrush has a slightly higher domain rating and estimate traffic along with marginally better
9:28:17
relevancy score giving it a slight edge. Pretty cool. So you can for example train your team. If I had a team member
9:28:24
who came on board to our agency, they've never done link building before. Or we could create an app like this to train
9:28:30
them internally so that we get better results. Using a combination of chat GBT and then also plugging that into
9:28:36
Firebase Studio, we can create free training tools. They're actually way more fun and easy for your team to use
9:28:42
in the background. Right? So you can see here, for example, the differences. Why is this better? Domain rate is higher.
9:28:47
Estimated traffic is higher. Relevancy score is higher. All right, next question. HFS or MOS? I'm going to go
9:28:53
with HFS. It's got to be. No way. But you get the point, right? Obviously, you would tweak this and improve it. And
9:29:00
there's no point comparing hfs and moss.com. But you get the point. Like it's really
9:29:05
easy to build this out. It looks super clean. We built it in one shot from idea to creation. And it's completely free.
9:29:12
Plus, it's super useful. Like you could actually use that in reality. So we got the SEO roast generator. And again, cuz
9:29:18
we're plugging in the API key, we can get results from the AI, right? So it doesn't need to be like a static code
9:29:24
website. You can get the AI to generate the responses based on the API key you build. So if we go back here now, I'm
9:29:31
going to take that template response. We'll plug that in. Then from here, we're going to say, okay, build a SEO
9:29:37
roast generator. I'll put the idea up here and then I'll explain. So build a
9:29:42
SEO roast generator where people enter their website.
9:29:47
Then the app delivers a cheeky AI generated roast, funny but educational
9:29:54
on the SEO mistakes. Then we can change the color scheme as well. Plug that in.
9:30:00
And it is much better. Like honestly, I don't know if you ever saw the live stream all the videos I did on Firebase
9:30:06
previously, but previously it was like it was super messy. Google Flash was just not working at all. This seems to
9:30:13
work a lot better. You seem to get much better results from it. So we'll hit prototype with AI now. And also what we
9:30:19
can do is compare these side by side. Right? So if you want to see okay, what can for example bold new create? And
9:30:25
bold. which is obviously a paid tool. So we can compare them side by side. So if
9:30:30
we copy this prompt, exactly the same prompt that we used to generate this, we see what outputs we get directly from
9:30:36
bold. By the way, for coding languages, Val recommends using TypeScript for the
9:30:43
ability to do back end and front end easily. So that's something to test as well when you're setting this up. Right.
9:30:48
Obviously, when you go to Firebase Studio, click on try here. This is the section where you can select between all
9:30:55
the different CUS as you can see. So, we're testing out Bolt side by side versus Firebase and
9:31:02
we'll see what we get back in a second. In the meantime, we've got the AI roast tool being built here. So, if you love
9:31:09
to see this stuff, let me pull them up side by side. It's going to be interesting to see whether this can actually beat bold. Or not. If it beats
9:31:15
it, that's pretty crazy. What we can also do as well is compare this versus Lovable. So, Lovable is another code
9:31:21
generation website which I can't access for some reason. There we go. Loveable.dev is There we go. All right.
9:31:28
So, let's plug this in. I'm just going to sign in here. The one thing that I'll be careful of is like when you're building out these apps as well is like
9:31:35
the AI may generate responses, for example, like the backlink generator, but that data might be fake, right?
9:31:42
Because the AI is hallucinating or making it up or assuming stuff. So, if you're going to build something that
9:31:48
requires data, I would always recommend like inserting your own database in there, right? Don't rely on the AI to
9:31:53
come up with the data for you. But these are just test runs we're showing you live on the video. So, let's plug these
9:31:59
in. And Lovable has just been updated to Loveable version two. So, this is going
9:32:04
to be interesting here. We'll plug this in. Exactly the same prompt. Bolt new is still coding away. And yeah, the really
9:32:11
cool thing I like about this is if you compare this side by side versus B, right, you don't get that nice sort of
9:32:17
briefing document here. You see here how it creates a nice little briefing document is right, here's a prototype.
9:32:23
Here's a name, here's the features, here's the style guidelines, right? And it's telling you exactly what it wants
9:32:28
and then you can click prototype this app. So you get more approval and more control over the process versus if
9:32:34
you're using bold new, it just goes off and builds it. it doesn't really give you any sort of input and you have to manually intervene yourself if it
9:32:41
doesn't work or if it's not quite right. Now, what you can also do if you click on edit the code once you've got the app
9:32:46
back, you can basically open it up like this, right? So, you can actually edit the code directly if you're more into
9:32:53
editing the individual files or viewing the files etc. You can also publish that
9:32:58
on Firebase too. But yeah, you can see an example here. So this is the app that
9:33:03
we got back from Firebase based on creating SEO my roast and it's looking
9:33:09
pretty cool. Let's check if it actually works. So if we go back here and by the
9:33:14
way if you want to go back just you can go back to studio.firebase.google.com
9:33:19
and then inside your workspaces here you can see all your workspaces. Now, one quick warning. If you're using the free
9:33:26
plan, then it's going to give you, I think, 10 free workspaces. So, just be careful
9:33:33
of that because you can't build like a 100 different projects. And if you need to go back and get more free workspaces,
9:33:38
then just delete any of the ones that you don't want to use. So, if we go back to SEO my roast now, let's pull this up.
9:33:45
Here we go. The outputs are already better. It's already much better than, for example, using the Flash. Google
9:33:52
Flash was just really poor. So, let's see what we get back. I'm surprised if
9:33:57
it actually works, but actually does. Wow, that's crazy. All right, so here you go. Your SEO roast is served for the
9:34:04
website. All right, Julian.com. Let's fire up the roast. Your website is like a dad joke at a funeral. Technically
9:34:10
present, but needs some serious help. First off, your site screams '90s website design, blah blah blah. SEO
9:34:15
website. Here's what to improve. Your content is decent but needs to be engaging. Mobile responsiveness blah
9:34:22
blah blah. Right? So, it's not bad at all. Now, obviously, that could be fake
9:34:27
data or it could be a fake response or completely hallucinated like I was talking about before, right? So, when
9:34:34
you're doing this, you just want to be careful it's actually giving you real data. if you're building out something
9:34:39
that requires like data or information or live pages on the web and that sort
9:34:44
of thing. But again, this is just a test run. We're doing live on a video. We're not going to release this for commercial
9:34:51
release. So, beneges actually to build this out, which is quite interesting. Let's have a look at
9:34:57
lovable. So, loveable was actually way faster as you can see. All right. So,
9:35:02
this is loveable.dev. Bold. is still building out. Oh, we've got the preview coming up now. Let's see what we get
9:35:08
back. All right, so it's built a dashboard. Let's pull this up. It's
9:35:14
built quite a nice dashboard to be fair. The only thing I don't like is it's got loads of dummy data in there. So, for
9:35:20
example, how do we add a transaction inside here? If we go to invoices, new invoice, put in an example, and we'll
9:35:28
put the notes in here. Hit create invoice and nothing happens, right? Okay. So, you can see here it's not
9:35:35
working. If we click on cancel, we can click out of it, but we can't add new invoices. Let's try the Firebase Studio
9:35:42
result. So, plug this in. We'll put an expense. Put $100 there. Put back links
9:35:48
as an example. We'll put the date. Add transaction. And it works perfectly, right? Boom. So, yeah. And you can see
9:35:55
that's showing up inside the total expenses here. So like the
9:36:00
output from Bolt, number one, you can't add expenses and
9:36:06
number two, it's all based on like fake dummy data. Whereas, for example, with Firebase, we built exactly the same
9:36:12
thing with exactly the same prompt. It's actually worked. We can add transactions. It's fully functional. And
9:36:20
this is a free tool. This is a paid tool, right? Bonu, you have to pay for it after a certain amount of tokens. So
9:36:26
big difference right there. Even like for example like the name of the business owner. It's just totally
9:36:31
hallucinated. Right. So let's try for example lovable. We'll open this up and
9:36:38
we'll compare them side by side now. This is what it's built out. But the problem here is we can't actually edit
9:36:45
any of the data. So it's just created like a sort of random dashboard but we can't interact with it. So let me show
9:36:52
you what I mean. If you go inside here, this is the example. But this is all based on fake data. We don't want that.
9:36:58
We want to start from the scratch. If someone starts using your app for financial dashboards, they don't want
9:37:04
all the data from John Doe inside there. Right now, if we go to finances here, it's got an example, but there's no
9:37:12
information, right? It says complete financial management module will be implemented in future updates. So, you
9:37:18
can't actually add like financial transactions. Whereas, for example, with this one, if we click on add
9:37:24
transaction, put $1,000 for backlinks, put back links in the description, hit
9:37:30
that in the transaction, boom, it's added. It's working perfectly, right? There's no fake data in there. It's not
9:37:36
wasting our time with hallucinated stuff like Firebase. It actually works now. It's actually probably better than Love
9:37:42
Wall. So, it's crazy to see this. Love Wall is a paid tool. You're paying a subscription for that. Firebase is a
9:37:49
free tool and it actually works better, creates more functionality, doesn't hallucinate as much. It's still going to
9:37:55
hallucinate sometimes, so just be aware of that. Yeah, you can see a huge difference in both right now. So, who
9:38:01
wins? I'm going to say Firebase so far from my test is winning. You can create awesome stuff like you can see right
9:38:06
here and you get better outputs than bolt new and loveful without dummy data
9:38:12
and without anything hallucinating. Crazy stuff. So, thanks so much for watching. If you want to get all my best
9:38:17
prompts for Firebase for SP for using this, etc., you can go to the AI profit
9:38:25
boardroom. We have tons of training on using Firebase plus building apps with data button as well as Trey AI, right?
9:38:33

9:39:53
finish the MVP on an app, but too many new AI tools." Yeah, that's it. Just
9:39:58
focus on one. But you can see if you were to choose a goat today. Like if you were to choose, okay, I'm building the
9:40:04
app from scratch today. What's the best? For me personally, I would say the Firebase is proven to be the best from
9:40:11
what we've seen. It's free. It actually works and it's easy to set up. I've shown you multiple different tests
9:40:17
today. So, thanks very much for watching. I'll see you on the next one. Cheers. Bye-bye. The new Google Gemini
9:40:22
2.5 Pro update is absolutely insane. You can see it just got released a few hours ago. It's completely free to code with
9:40:28
if you do what I'm about to show you. And I literally spent like 5 minutes testing out this new update. You can see
9:40:34
I built AI powered keyword research tool, a CRM, and even a Roman
9:40:39
marketplace simulator. You can see right here, which we can play kind of like a game, and it was super easy. I literally
9:40:44
just gave it like two prompts, one shot. Boom. I'll show you exactly how I built it. I'll show you exactly how to access
9:40:50
all this for free and test it headto-head against Claude. Spoiler. One of them was not even close. And I'll
9:40:56
show you exactly why that is in a minute. Plus, I'll walk you through setting up with AI Studio, Visual Studio Code, and even show you the new Bolt DIY
9:41:03
integration that works basically perfectly. And if you've been waiting for coding AI that actually delivers in
9:41:10
one shot, one prompt, like you can see right here, then this is it. And let me show you how to start building with AI
9:41:17
in just a few minutes. Let's go. Brand new update from Google Gemini 2.5 Pro.
9:41:23
As you can see right here, I've been testing out today. actually just created a full CRM like you can see and even a
9:41:30
3JS Roman marketplace simulation which is pretty crazy. We can zoom in and zoom
9:41:35
out of that right there. And it looks absolutely banging to be honest with you. It looks really good. And so what
9:41:42
we're going to be doing today is just testing out seeing how it works, seeing what we can build with it, and seeing how powerful. Now already just from the
9:41:48
look and feel, from what I've built, I've literally just run these two tests in 5 minutes. is absolutely rapid when
9:41:54
it comes back to you. And if you're wondering, okay, what does this mean? What's all the new differences, etc.? So, this is Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
9:42:03
preview. And basically what it's focused on is even better coding performance.
9:42:09
Now, I would already say that Gemini 2.5 Pro so far has been goated in terms of
9:42:14
performance and in terms of the outputs. It's getting better all the time and this is just another massive upgrade.
9:42:20
So, if you want to get access to this for free, you can go over to aistic studio.google.com.
9:42:27
Then you can select Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview in the top right here. And you will see the May the 6 update right
9:42:35
here. Okay. So, this is available. It is free to use. I've not got my credit card details plugged in here. I think it does
9:42:41
have some limits, but you can use it for free. And then if you have Gemini Advanced, you can also get access to
9:42:46
this inside Gemini directly here and then preview stuff in the canvas. tends to look better to be honest with you, but it looks really cool either way. You
9:42:53
can see basically in terms of the web dev arena leaderboard, Gemini 2.5 Pro
9:42:59
now ranks number one. And I would honestly say they came out of nowhere this year. Like the tool was never that
9:43:05
good. And then Gemini 2.5 Pro came out and it was absolutely awesome. So you can see it's absolutely dominating the
9:43:12
web dev arena leaderboard. From my own tests, I would say it's definitely better than claw 3.7 Sonic. It's also a
9:43:18
lot faster and it's awesome for building stuff out. So you can also see for example here you can do some other cool
9:43:25
stuff. So for example, you can actually video to code now. So it's got this video understanding and then you can use
9:43:31
that to generate code as well. It's really easy to just code stuff out directly and we'll be testing this out
9:43:38
in a second. All right. Now if you want to see what other people are building with it, here's some examples from the
9:43:43
actual Google team. So they said, "Here's what our team is building in canvas with Gemini 2.5 Pro, the new
9:43:49
addition today." And you can see, for example, someone here created like a fun
9:43:54
sound guessing game. We've got another one where someone built out a whole website for a one shop app for looking
9:44:03
through books and stuff like that. Someone else built out this tool for mortgages and calculations and stuff.
9:44:10
And here's another one. This was a garden bed planner, which is pretty crazy. It actually looks really cool.
9:44:15
And additionally, we even have some games. So, for example, you see here, this is a game for learning like about
9:44:21
chemistry, molecules, and stuff like that. And additionally, we have the McBth line rehearsal app. So, you can
9:44:28
build anything that you want. Any idea that you have, you can build and is absolutely amazing. For example, for
9:44:34
building out this CRM dashboard, here's how I did it. This is how easy. It's absolutely silly. So, if you want to go
9:44:39
and build stuff, you just go to new chat. Then, you're going to select 2.5 Pro. You don't need any coding
9:44:44
experience now to build whatever you want. And you can see for example here what it said was build a CRM, right?
9:44:51
Very simple prompt. Not like a particularly difficult prompt at all. Then I said yes cuz it was asking me
9:44:56
some ideas and what we need to do, etc. And then from here it was like, okay, great. Let's just go and build it out.
9:45:02
And it literally build this out, asked it to build it into HTML and canvas. And
9:45:08
then finally from there it built something but it was not working when I was clicking through between these. So I
9:45:13
actually said make sure that I can click through the tabs when I'm using it. When I click each section nothing happens.
9:45:19
Please fix it. Boom. Shack lacker. That was fixed and corrected. Like you can see here's another example. So I said
9:45:25
create a real world simulation of a marketplace in Roman times in canvas. And it created something that was very
9:45:30
basic. If we actually open this up you can see the previous generation. It's just like a flat sort of 2D simulator
9:45:37
right here. Then I said, "Okay, make the people more realistic and make it 3DS so I can see the whole thing and move
9:45:43
around." And it was like, "Yeah, no problem, mate." So it went off. It did that. And now you can see we can
9:45:49
actually just use that right here. And I think the more iterations you do inside 2.5 Pro, the more realistic you can make
9:45:56
it look. But you can see how cool that is. For example, if we said maybe we want to, for example, add more detail, right? You could say add more detail,
9:46:04
improve the market stalls, make it all feel more realistic, have
9:46:12
more detail to the people, etc. Right? And then if you want to share this stuff, you can actually click on share
9:46:18
over here. It will create a link for you. And this is just implemented on a subdomain inside gemini.google.com. So
9:46:25
if we click on confirm a view, we have the marketplace ready to preview right here. really easy and simple to do,
9:46:32
super fast. Um, you know me, like I've tested, for example, tools like Quen, Claude, and if it lets me down, I just
9:46:38
show you on the live stream, right? But this one was actually super powerful. So, let's try this. I'm just going to say add more detail, improve market
9:46:44
source, blah blah blah, and we'll see what we get back. Now, see if we can just take this to a whole new level.
9:46:50
Now, again, if you want to use it inside AI Studio, you can do exactly the same thing. it doesn't seem to have like a
9:46:56
canvas option. So you'd have to for example just go inside the chat here use similar sort of prompts and then we can
9:47:03
say okay building in 3JS and we'll just put just HTML
9:47:08
preview hit run and then we should be good to to go on that. So it tends to
9:47:15
take a little bit longer inside AR studio but you also get more control over it. So for example here you can
9:47:20
check the token count. You can check the temperature. You can also switch between
9:47:25
like code execution, function calling etc. You can even add Google search as
9:47:31
well which is pretty cool. And additionally you've got like some advanced settings on the right hand side
9:47:37
as well in terms of like output length and that sort of thing. Now if we go back we've got the Roman
9:47:43
marketplace with a bit more detail, more buildings etc. It's added more detail to
9:47:49
the marketplace stores. And if we look at the people, you can see they've just got a bit more detail to them. Now, if
9:47:55
we keep going and we keep iterating on that, eventually we'll get something that looks really good. But as a first
9:48:00
sort of what is this, a third draft, it's not bad at all. And it looks really cool.
9:48:08
You just build out your own games. If you spent a whole day on this, you could create something absolutely awesome. To be fair, someone asks, what does the
9:48:16
temperature do? So the temperature inside AR studio will just make it more creative, right? So it's a creativity
9:48:21
allowed in the responses. If you increase the creativity, if you increase the temperature, then it will be more
9:48:26
creative in its outputs, but it's also more likely to break or to do something nonsensical as well. All right, so
9:48:32
that's coding this out. Now we've got that good to go. Let's have a look and we'll just run that on the preview. So
9:48:38
we're going to go to HTML code editor. Plug that in.
9:48:44
We'll have a look at liveweave.com. And that tends to be better for previewing code, especially if it's something like
9:48:49
this. And now we have the Roman market simulation like you can see. To be fair,
9:48:55
I mean, I actually think the outputs were better inside AI Studio than they are inside
9:49:01
Gemini Advanced cuz that's added more detail already. But yeah, you can see here the market stores, the people, etc.
9:49:08
You could also animate that as well. So you could go back inside Gemini AR
9:49:15
Studio, make the design more interesting and animated and lifelike, but I would
9:49:22
say it's like the ultimate vibe coding tool right now because you can just keep going back and forth with it very quick
9:49:27
to make changes. Now the other thing is here as well is if we pull this up and we compare it versus something like Claude. So let's do that. All right. And
9:49:35
what we'll do is we'll just run exactly the same thing on both at the same time, right? to try and make it fair. So, if
9:49:41
we go back to a new chapter here, we've got 2.5 Pro experimental and then we've
9:49:46
got Claude, which I would say is the second best option, right? So, you got two different options there. Again, this
9:49:52
is for coding specifically like this is what Gemini is really good at. So, if we go into
9:49:58
for example here and we'll test which one creates the best outputs. So, let's
9:50:04
see what we got. Yeah, we can try with the simple 3D car simulator in 3JS.
9:50:10
So, let's plug that into Gemini and we'll plug it into Claude. I'm going to give Claude the head start. So, we'll
9:50:16
hit enter on Claude like and then we'll hit enter on Gemini and we'll see which one number one performs fastest and
9:50:22
which one gives us the best outputs as well. Just need to select canvas as well inside Gemini advanced.
9:50:28
Someone said compare it against Quen as well. Quen is just from what I've seen so far
9:50:34
is so bad at outputs. So the other thing here as well is like by default claw doesn't have thinking
9:50:40
mode selected whereas Gemini 2.5 Pro you can see it automatically goes straight into thinking mode before it starts
9:50:47
coding anything out. And you can see now it's coding out. Claude is doing the
9:50:53
same thing. And we'll see which one comes up with the best outputs. So you can see here,
9:51:00
let's have a look. This is crazy. All right, so they pretty much finished at the same time here. But what you can see
9:51:07
is it's come back to us with this blue screen, my friends. Imagine if I was
9:51:12
trying to do a tutorial on YouTube and I'm trying to show you some cool stuff that you can do with AI. And then the
9:51:19
tool that I pay £150 a month for doesn't give me anything. But the tool that I've
9:51:25
got completely for free inside AI Studio, it works perfectly. That's the big
9:51:31
difference here. And look at this. We're zooming around. We're having the time of our lives driving this 3JS car and it is
9:51:39
working perfectly. Whereas if you go to Claude, nothing is happening, right? I'm
9:51:44
pressing up and down, pressing the arrows, etc. It says speed is 100 km an hour, but I
9:51:52
can't see anything. And there's no preview here or anything like that, right? It's just it's absolutely that's
9:51:57
what you get back from Claude. So you can see the difference here. Exactly the same prompt, but Gemini just gives
9:52:05
us way better outputs. Like 10 times better. And also it's very easy to deploy this. We could add more detail to
9:52:12
it as well. We can zoom around the map and we can build out as much detail as
9:52:17
we want inside this project and then deploy it as well in a subdomain. But it's miles above the second best coding
9:52:23
tool in the world. And I think until Claude releases like version 4, it's
9:52:29
just not going to be able to compete. It's nowhere near the same level. Now, the other cool thing here as well is if
9:52:34
we go over to open router. So, I've already shown you how to code and vibe code with it inside, for example. By the
9:52:41
way, this is the output. It looks better now. But yeah, so I've already shown you how to, for example, code inside Gemini
9:52:47
Advanced. I've shown you how to get free access to Gemini 2.5 Pro inside Google AI Studio.
9:52:54
And if we take that iteration of what we created previously, let's see what we got back here. Yeah, look at that. It's
9:53:01
just magical, isn't it? We got people floating around. We got people walking around the market store.
9:53:09
We created that in one shot and it was incredibly easy. Let's pull this up full
9:53:14
screen for you. Like this is I don't know if anyone here used to play Mega Drive back in the day or whatever. This
9:53:20
is probably better graphics than something like an old school Mega Drive. It's kind of like when the N64 came out.
9:53:26
So that's what we're looking at here, peeps. It's super powerful, easy to create stuff, easy to build stuff. You
9:53:33
don't even need to be a great prompter at this point, let alone need to code or understand what code is. It's incredibly
9:53:39
easy. Now if we go over to open router we can also select models over here and
9:53:44
we can start coding with the models for example if we go to this page
9:53:52
I think we should have I want to make sure have we got open router on Google
9:53:59
on have we got Google 2.5 pro experimental on open router here we go all right by
9:54:07
the way just make sure you filter to buy newest. I think Open Marita has changed that recently. So, if we click on here,
9:54:14
we have the April model, but I can't see the latest model from Google. We go on
9:54:20
to the Open Routter homepage here. Yeah, it doesn't seem to be available on Open Routter yet. But what you can do is if
9:54:27
you go over to AI Studio and then inside here, you're going to get an API key,
9:54:33
then create an API key. Once you've done that, then you can go over to something
9:54:39
called Visual Studio Code. I have the full recipe inside the AR profit boardroom link in the comments description if you want like the
9:54:45
instructions on how to set up. And then from here, if we go over to client,
9:54:50
then select Google Gemini. Let's see if we've got this available to code with.
9:54:57
Here we go. All right. Here's how to do it. Right. So if you go inside Klein and
9:55:03
then using 2.5 Pro, it's upgraded right here. So all you
9:55:08
need to do is use 0325 in Klein and that automatically points to the newest
9:55:15
version. So if we go to 325, let's do that now. Client inside the inst
9:55:20
extensions 325 is the one that you want to select. Then you're going to plug in your API key that you got from AI Studio
9:55:28
earlier. And then inside this section, just make sure you do have pro experimental setup. And then inside
9:55:34
here, if we X off here, we'll go back to the AR profit boardroom. And we'll just
9:55:40
grab a random prompt from here. So, let's see what we can do here. Grab that.
9:55:47
Now, inside the custom instructions, I'm actually going to delete this stuff cuz I don't really use it that much. All
9:55:53
right, let's hit save on that. And then we're going to plug this in. And I'm going to say generate a high converting
9:55:59
landing page for my SEO agency. Just see what it pulls up. So this is using the
9:56:04
latest version of Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. And that was super easy to set up. And you can see here it actually
9:56:11
gives you the API cost. So this is proof that you can code with it using the API for free, right? It's not costing you
9:56:18
anything to use this before I start getting YouTube comments telling me it's not free. So it's created the HTML. Now
9:56:25
it's creating the CSS. Let's see what else we can build with in the meantime. So, I'm going to say let's have a look
9:56:32
what we got here. Really, you want to use it for coding. So, I'm just going to focus on coding related tools. Let's try
9:56:38
a keyword research tool over here. Let's go inside Gemini. Now,
9:56:44
plug that in. Always select canvas and then hit enter. What I'm going to do
9:56:50
in the meantime is go back to AI Studio. We'll try and create something cool in here. So you can code like three
9:56:55
different projects here with Gemini, with AI Studio, and then also with Visual Studio Code. And then whilst
9:57:00
you're waiting for the code to generate, it's quite easy to flick between the tabs and just test different stuff out.
9:57:06
See what else what other cool stuff you can build. Right. So I'm going to say, okay, 3GS
9:57:11
SEO related game for my SEO agency
9:57:17
focused on building back links. Make it fun and interesting like a 3D
9:57:26
run a game for SEOs. Make the graphics also code in HTML.
9:57:34
Then if you press command and enter that will just run the prompt so you can get the outputs.
9:57:41
In the meantime, we've now got the tool back from
9:57:46
the AI powered research tool. So it's created a keyword research tool that we
9:57:51
can just plug in an API key and some ideas of like keywords we want to generate. Right? So for example, if we
9:57:57
put dogs inside the niche and then inside the API key, I'm just going to grab that from AI Studio in the
9:58:03
background. Basically like you can build your own custom tools. Now this is not guaranteed to work, right? Quite often
9:58:08
when you build these types of tools where you're plugging in your own API key, it can break, but let's see what we
9:58:14
get back. So I'm going to copy and then plug this in. Hit start keyword research. That's finding the keywords
9:58:20
for us here. And I'm going to say it's not using AI to generate this. I'm going to say don't
9:58:27
use presets. Get the AI/ API
9:58:32
to generate keyword ideas based on whatever niche I typed in. In
9:58:38
the meantime, if go back to the chat now, that is already generated. It's ridiculously fast. It's so fast. It's
9:58:46
silly. Now, let's go back to LiveWave and we'll test this out. We'll
9:58:53
plug that bad boy in. And we've created the SEO runner game. So, you see here,
9:58:58
for example, you have to get tools, you have to avoid the spam, you increasing your DA, etc. And it works pretty
9:59:06
nicely. All right. Then we've got the penalty, and that messed us up. Now again, if you want to improve this, just
9:59:12
go back to your code here and just say, "Okay, make this more colorful, add much
9:59:19
more detail to the whole level." SLRunner,
9:59:26
make it feel more realistic. And I'm add a retro vibe
9:59:32
to it as well. make the background
9:59:37
like an SEO traffic chart and then we'll run that and we'll see what we get back in a sec. In the meantime, this has come
9:59:44
back to us with the new code and we can just keep flicking between everything. So, we can v code like three things at
9:59:49
the same time because we're waiting for all the different pieces to finish, right? So, if we hit start keyword research over here, boom, look at that.
9:59:57
So, it's actually worked now. Again, we just put one prompt there. Then, we went back. always just give it the feedback
10:00:03
on exactly what you want or what the problem is and then we've got the keywords ready to go right here and it's generated that using AI right you could
10:00:10
also say okay like tailor the outputs more to the topic right so what is dogs obviously not grammatically correct and
10:00:18
maybe some of these are like placeholder keywords as well so say okay
10:00:23
make sure you avoid placeholder keywords
10:00:28
make sure the keywords are generated with AI tailor
10:00:34
the keyword ideas specifically
10:00:40
to the topic I type in. Example
10:00:45
doc you come up with keyword ideas like
10:00:52
cool dog names using the AI and the API. Now if we go back to Visual
10:00:59
Studio Code that is finished. Now we can hit run command and load this up. And we've got the oneshot page right
10:01:06
here. There's parts of this that I just don't think that and and I've always found this with Gemini particularly.
10:01:13
I've never found it with Claude so much, but when you use the API directly inside Visual Studio Code, quite often the
10:01:20
outputs are not as nice as running it through the canvas inside Gemini. Right?
10:01:25
So, that's just one thing to bear in mind, but you can see how you can code stuff for free and it's pretty easy and simple to use right there. Now, we go
10:01:32
back to Gemini here and we've got the outputs again. This is the improved runner game.
10:01:40
We'll go back to LiveWave over here and test it. Right? So, you can see here now
10:01:45
it's messed up the code a little bit and we can't see anything. We can't see any characters, etc. So, if I was like going
10:01:51
back, I would just ask it to improve that. And you can see that it's not perfect. Right? We've tested it to the limits, which is what I wanted to show
10:01:56
you today. I don't want to show you like, oh, this is perfect if it's not. And you've got to see like the pros and
10:02:02
the cons of this, but essentially, you can see how this works step by step. And then, additionally, if we go back to
10:02:08
Gemini now, we've got the new version right here. So, let's plug in the API
10:02:14
key again, see what we get back. And then we got some keyword ideas there. I still think that could be improved a
10:02:19
lot. So, you can see the pros and the cons of this. like it can create the basics pretty quickly, but it does
10:02:27
mess up a little bit. I don't know why it's simulating. It should be using the actual API call. So, I'm going to say
10:02:32
make sure you do a live API call inside
10:02:37
the tool, not a simulated one. The other thing you can do here is if you go to
10:02:43
NA10. So, if we log into NA10 here, right, you can actually build. I think I've
10:02:49
actually cancelled my NA10 account, that's why. But you can actually build for free using NA10 as well, just using
10:02:57
the API from Google as well. So, it's quite easy to set up like agents. I've actually got some examples of how to do
10:03:04
that inside the AI profit boardroom, right? So, if you want to learn how to use this stuff, you can actually just
10:03:10
type in NA10 here and then you'll see all my best workflows, including like how to use stuff like Google Gemma and
10:03:18
Google Gemini 2.5 Pro for free inside NA10 to build whatever you want. Like you see right here, we've got the full
10:03:24
details. Like, so today we've covered all the ways that you can code with Gemini and what the tool does, how
10:03:31
powerful it is, and what it can create, right? And also the limitations of this, where it gets stuck and where it messes up. So, you know, it's not perfect. I've
10:03:38
shown you what it can and can't do. And yeah, you get the point here. So, we've shown you Gemini, I've shown you AI
10:03:45
Studio, we've looked at N8N, we've also looked, for example, at Visual Studio
10:03:50
Code. There's one more tool that I want to show you today, and that is Windurf cuz I know you've probably heard the
10:03:57
news. I think Chat Chubity is buying them for $3 billion, something crazy like that, right? So, if you want to use
10:04:03
Windsurf, let me show you an example. Right. So, let's open up a new project
10:04:09
here and close that one. Then we can just open up a new folder and we'll
10:04:15
create a new one. We're going to open that up. I think they've just released actually. So, you can see it's
10:04:21
downloading the update in the top right here. They've actually just released Windserf version 8. And then you've got
10:04:27
these two options, right? So, you can use chat or you can use write. And then we're just going to restart this to update to the new version. By the way,
10:04:35
these are all the new features inside Windsurf 8 as you can see. So, these are
10:04:40
the new changes. I think this literally just came out. Yeah, May the 6th. So, it's a brand new update. And you can
10:04:45
also see Gemini 2.5 Pro is available down there. So, if we go to Windsurf
10:04:51
now, I click that. Let's load this bad boy up. Windsurf is
10:04:57
totally failing on me. All right. Great. All right. At least you know then as well. Maybe you can't use it inside
10:05:03
Windsurf. I'm just being 100% transparent with you and you can see what works and what doesn't work today
10:05:09
as well. So, thanks very much for watching. Some people are saying Winder is more like
10:05:16
Wind Crash. I would agree with you today. It definitely let me down part of
10:05:21
the game. Usually, it's pretty good. Fair enough. They get purchased for 3 billion. You can't open it up. Doesn't
10:05:26
make sense to me. So, thanks so much for watching. If you want to get access to the AI profit boardroom with all my best
10:05:33
workflows, templates, SPs, etc., including how to code with all of the tools I've shown you, feel free to get
10:05:39
that inside the AI profit boardroom, inside the community as well. You can ask any questions you have. Also comes
10:05:44
with weekly Q&A calls, and additionally, all my best courses, agents, workflows, templates, and daily updated SPs. We
10:05:53
update this bad boy every single day with new updates on all the latest stuff that's happening right now.
10:05:59
Additionally, if you want to get a free one-to-one SEO strategy session that shows you how
10:06:04
we take websites from zero to 145,000 visits month and generate hundreds of thousands of dollars on autopilot, feel
10:06:10
free to get that link in the comments description and we'll show you exactly how to increase your SEO traffic, get more leads, traffic, and sales for free
10:06:17
using SEO. One thing I want to try. I've totally forgotten about this, but I want to try it right now. So, let's give it a
10:06:24
whirl. And that is bolt DIY. So, I'm going to shut down Windsurf.
10:06:30
Shame on you, Windsurf. And then what we can do here is we'll grab the
10:06:35
instructions for setting this up like you can see right here. And then we're just going to get this set up on
10:06:41
terminal. All right. Once you got it set up, we can go to the local host. If you
10:06:46
ever had any problems setting up with the SAP or whatever or GitHub, whatever, just plug it into Claude. It will save
10:06:52
you a lot of time. It'll tell you exactly what the problem is. And then what you can do from here is we're going to select Google. And from here, we're
10:06:58
going to select, let's see what we got here, 2.5 Pro
10:07:03
Experimental. Or you could use preview. And then if you ever want to code with Pro,
10:07:11
you can just go inside here, select the model that you want. So this is a brand new model by the way the it's created
10:07:17
May the 7th right? So it's pro preview that you need to select. Then from here
10:07:23
we're just going to grab an API key from open router. So go to open router top right keys create key. Then we're going
10:07:31
to plug in the API key here. And then from here let's test coding. So we'll just say build just for the sake of time
10:07:37
build a simple SEO calculator. And there you go. All right. Super easy and simple to do. Paste in the article. paste in
10:07:43
the keyword works perfectly first time round. You can use bolt DIY set it up
10:07:49
locally code locally and to be honest it actually works plus it's free whereas wind surf it let us down directly on the
10:07:57
video today. So, thanks very much for watching. That is basically how to use all of this stuff, how to code with anything. We've talked through Bolt,
10:08:03
Gemini, AI Studio. We've also talked through Windsor, Visual Studio Code, and
10:08:08
NA10 as well. If you want to get all my best SPS, templates, workflows. It's all inside the air a profit boardroom. We
10:08:13
update the SPS daily. We're adding new updates all the time. Plus, the community is absolutely awesome. And if
10:08:20
you join, you can actually become an affiliate if you want to make money that way as well. And it's super simple and
10:08:26
easy to get set up. So, thanks very much for watching and I'll see you on the next one. Cheers. Bye-bye. Today we have
10:08:32
the new update from Google Gemini 2.5 Flash. So, this is a brand new update.
10:08:39
It's currently in preview mode like you can see right here. And you can get access to it via the Gemini API in
10:08:46
Google AI Studio or Vertex AI as well. We'll be comparing the benchmarks in a second. Bear in mind 2.5 flash is a
10:08:54
thinking model but you can actually switch it off inside Gemini directly here. So if we go to a studio.google.com
10:09:01
you can start using it. From what I've seen it is actually free to use for a million tokens. So you can see here it's
10:09:06
got a token count. It doesn't seem to charge me anything for using this. I don't think I've even got my credit card
10:09:12
plugged in here. And then we can switch between thinking mode or non-thinking mode. And it's pretty easy and simple to
10:09:18
use. So they basically said, "Building on the popular foundation of 2.0 Flash, this
10:09:24
new version delivers a major upgrade in reasoning capabilities whilst prioritizing speed and cost." So let's
10:09:29
grab some prompts from the AI profit boardroom. Link in the comments description if you want to get these and
10:09:35
then let's start testing out. So what we're going to say here is, can you create a simple runner game in 3JS?
10:09:43
So we'll test it out. Right now I'm going to leave thinking on mode on now cuz this is for like a coding task which
10:09:49
takes a bit of thinking and reasoning to start using and it's now running its magic like so let's see how that
10:09:55
performs. We'll come back to it in a second in terms of how it's performing. So it says Gemini 2.5 models thinking
10:10:01
models etc on complex tasks that require multiple steps of reasoning. The thinking process allows the model to
10:10:06
arrive at more accurate and comprehensive answers. In fact, Gemini 2.5 Flash performs strongly on hard
10:10:12
prompts on LM Arena, second only to 2.5 Pro. Now, one of the biggest
10:10:18
differentiators about this model is that actually it's a lot cheaper if you are coding with it directly. So, if you're
10:10:23
using the API directly from something like Open Router is way cheaper. All
10:10:29
right. So, for example, here if we go to the models, we can see Google Gemini 2.5
10:10:35
Pro previews available on Open Router. If we click on this, you can see how much it costs and it is pretty pretty
10:10:42
cheap. So, this is per million tokens by the way, which is very cheap. We got 2.5 flash preview there as well. That is
10:10:49
even cheaper. Actually, this is the one we want to use. So, we go to 2.5 preview. You can see here 0.15
10:10:58
per million input tokens, output tokens, 0.6, and that was created on April the
10:11:04
17th. Now if we actually compare it and see where it's available to use so we can use it inside root code client all the usual suspects right here and let's
10:11:12
go back to Gemini inside this model still coding out. We've got the code ready to go. Let's preview this on p5 js
10:11:20
and we'll see how it performs. And actually this is on HTML so we can just run the code right here. So run it
10:11:25
inside liveweave test out. We got the car ready to go. Seems to be sideways but let's see what we got here. There we
10:11:32
go. It's coded out perfectly to be fair to it. The car itself is not great, but
10:11:37
we've created a 3D game in like literally two seconds messing around with it and one single prompt, one shot.
10:11:43
Let's see if we can go off road here. Look at that. We're flying. Absolutely flying. Not bad at all. It looks like
10:11:49
we're coming to the end of the road here. But yeah, works perfectly. Nice. Cool. So, let's keep going through. You
10:11:55
can see the comparisons of the models. So, we've got Gemini 2.5 Flash versus 2.0 O Flash and OpenAI Claude 3.7 Sonic
10:12:02
Gro 3 and Deepseek R1. So if we compare the prices as you can see Claude 3.7
10:12:08
Sonic is $3 per million tokens. Gemini 2.5 Flash is
10:12:15
0.15 per million tokens. So price and the cost difference is absolutely insane.
10:12:21
It's performing pretty well on humanity's last exam. GP QA Diamond
10:12:28
performing pretty well. So is comparable. I always take these benchmarks with a little bit of pinch of salt, but it seems pretty good at coding
10:12:34
from what I've seen so far as well. Basically, this is the most costefficient thinking model, right? So
10:12:39
you can code with thinking models, but it is a lot cheaper and you can see how it performs right here. This is
10:12:45
interesting as well. So they actually have a thinking budget that offers fine grained control over the maximum number
10:12:50
of tokens, right? So what does that mean? That means basically you can fine-tune this and set a budget for how
10:12:58
much thinking you want it to do, right? How advanced you want the thinking to be. That offers fine grain control over the maximum number of tokens. So the
10:13:05
higher the budget, the more it's going to be. So for example, you might have prompts that require low reasoning,
10:13:11
medium reasoning, or high reasoning, right, when you're coding this out. And so if something just requires a little
10:13:16
bit of reasoning, then you can lower the budget and spend less tokens, right? It saves you money as well. So it seems
10:13:21
like you can get it inside Google AI studio which we were coding with before over here. You can also get it inside
10:13:27
vertex AI and also it's available on open router as well. So let's see how
10:13:33
this performs. We're going to plug this into root code over here. So I'm going to grab this prompt from the AI profit
10:13:38
boardroom. Let's open up R code. Grab that inside Visual Studio Code. I got SPS on this if you want to learn how to
10:13:44
set this stuff up inside the AR profit boardroom. And then from here we are going to go to open router and it's
10:13:51
flash that you want to be using. Okay. And yeah, if you're wondering this model did just come out today, literally a few
10:13:56
hours ago. So it's a brand new model. So we'll use flash preview. You can switch between thinking and flash preview here.
10:14:02
So we'll select flash preview for now. Hit save. Hit done. And then inside here
10:14:08
we'll start coding out. So just going to use this prompt to generate a landing page and see how that performs. should
10:14:14
give us a price as well as we go through. Or we can check the token count on open router if that doesn't give us a
10:14:20
price. Pretty fast. So you can see the cost here. It's just ridiculous. It's not even a scent. It's cost us so far
10:14:26
0.0083 to run this. And we've just built the website. Seems really fast as well. Let's open that up. See how we get on.
10:14:33
So that is the website ready to go. Obviously it it requires a lot more back and forth than that, but just to build a
10:14:39
simple website out. Pretty fast, pretty easy to do, super cheap. Wouldn't say it's as good as Claw 3.7 Sonnet.
10:14:46
Honestly, when you're building stuff out with that, but it does the job. Let's have a look. Now, we'll test this out for building out a calculator landing
10:14:53
page. So, let's grab this. In fact, first thing I'm going to do is just say, can you improve the UI? Make it more
10:14:59
colorful, sleek, and modern. I'm impressed with the cost and the speed. I'm not impressed with the UI so far. I
10:15:06
still think Gemini Pro is going to do something a lot better than that. Let's go back to Gemini as well. So we can use
10:15:12
this inside Gemini directly. So if you go inside Gemini Advance, which is a paid model, you can switch between 2.0
10:15:20
Flash. Flash Pro is the one that just came out today. So it's 2.5 flash. And
10:15:25
then we can also use the canvas here. And I think that'll give you better results for tools and that sort of thing. Right. So if we grab this and we
10:15:32
plug that through Gemini, honestly, I think you're going to get much better results. But let's see what we get back here. And the good thing is if it's a
10:15:38
simple HTML canvas sort of thing, then you can quickly just build it and preview it inside the canvas here. So
10:15:44
once this is done, we can click on preview and then test it out. Some people are saying this has comparatively
10:15:50
low benchmarks. It depends what you're comparing it to, right? So for example, OpenAI 04 Mini is comparatively lower,
10:15:58
right? But if you actually compare it to Claude 3.7 Sonic, it is holding its own,
10:16:04
right? So for example, humanity's last exam, you can see here 12.1% for 2.5
10:16:09
flash, it is outperforming CLA 3.7 Sonnet. For GPQA diamond, it's pretty
10:16:16
much the same as 3.7 Sonnet. Let's have a look what else we got here. For maths, it's outperforming Claude by a long way.
10:16:22
I don't think you're going to beat Open O4 Mini, but look at the price difference. It's literally almost 10x,
10:16:29
isn't it? So, you know, that's the difference right here. when I've tested out O4 Mini as well, it takes ages to
10:16:35
code with it and it just wasn't that impressive. You check out my other videos on that. So, we've got this back.
10:16:40
Let's see what we got here. That is looking a little bit more like it. Honestly, it's pretty average. Let's have a look inside Gemini Advancer and
10:16:46
see what we got here. Ah, that is just even worse, mate. Even worse, Sunshack.
10:16:51
All right, let's test something else out now. So, what I'm going to see is does this give us better outputs if we just
10:16:56
ask for a very basic prompt and we don't make it too complicated. So if I say okay create the best possible SEO
10:17:03
calculator you can with a beautiful plus
10:17:09
changing color background and information selling SEO agency on the
10:17:14
page. Let's see what that does. It did pretty well in the game. It did pretty bad for you. But let's see what it comes back with on this. I wonder if it's good
10:17:20
for creating content as well cuz it's outperforming Craw 3.7 Sonic which is one of my best and favorite tools for
10:17:26
creating content. So we'll test that in a second. Yeah, that's just particularly average, isn't it? I think for UI, you
10:17:34
are you going to use that? It's definitely not It's not the best. It's not the best, mate. I'll tell you that for free. If we switch over to Let me
10:17:42
compare this side by side versus Pro, right? So, if we go over to Pro right here, and then we use exactly the same
10:17:49
prompt, I can almost guarantee you're going to get better results, but let's see what we get back. So, this is pro
10:17:55
experimental and we're testing the same prompt but side by side versus flash. I'm going to ask as well in the meantime
10:18:01
just make the U much nicer and more modern and sleek cuz you're never going
10:18:06
to publish that website, right? That's even bolt or something could do better than that. Some people saying I think
10:18:12
2.0 Flash is better than that. I would agree with you there. I think genuinely I've not seen bad that bad UI for a long
10:18:18
time. What's up crowd? I just honestly like even on the review I it's not a great UI. It might be really good for
10:18:25
other stuff like for example coding the back end or for example creating content
10:18:30
which we'll test in a second but for coding out UI you just wouldn't publish
10:18:36
that right like it's way too basic. That gives you a much better style. You can
10:18:41
improve the color contrasting right there. So if we say to it now okay just make the colors more contrasting. PG.
10:18:49
The font versus the background should be
10:18:54
contrasting and easy to read, make the font more modern, but that definitely looks better than 2.5 Flash, which after
10:19:02
a couple of revisions looks pretty bad. So, I got to say I'm disappointed on the UI side for sure. All right, let's test
10:19:08
something else out now. So, what I'm going to say is make me a captivating
10:19:13
endless runner game in P5 JS. We'll do that inside AI Studio while the other two are coding out. Good thing with
10:19:19
Google is that you can code in multiple tabs and then whilst I'm talking to you, you can see the outputs from each. So,
10:19:25
we'll see what that comes back with as well. All right, so that was pretty trash. That's the output from 2.5 Pro,
10:19:30
which I'd say is definitely better. Let's have a look what we got back from AI Studio here. In the meantime, we'll
10:19:37
run a content prompt as well. So, I'm going to grab this prompt right here, and we'll see how it performs for creating content. So, we'll run Flash
10:19:44
Experimental and test it out. Again, though, just to reiterate, because I know some people will say, "Oh, this is not free, blah,
10:19:50
blah, blah." I'm using 2.5 Flash preview for free inside AI Studio. Gemini
10:19:55
Advanced is a paid model, so you're not going to get it free there. If you use the API, you're not going to get it
10:20:00
free. But if you code inside AI Studio directly using Flash Preview over here,
10:20:06
then it shouldn't cost you any money from what I know. So, I don't even have my billing details in here. So, we got the P. Why is it coding it in separate
10:20:13
files? Here we go. All right, let's copy this. So, we go to P5GS and just test
10:20:18
this. Plug that in. Hit play. Dino Runner. Pixel Dino Runner. Ready to go. Let's see what we get. Background's not
10:20:25
bad. Game is working perfectly. UI is not great. But that's a one-shot prompt,
10:20:31
which is pretty impressive to be fair. I don't like the colors. Again, I think it does struggle on UI stuff. Like, I think
10:20:36
that's what it's probably the worst at so far. Let's see how it does on
10:20:42
creating the content. So, let's talk about Gro A and what it means to anyone serious about SEO and creating it.
10:20:47
Banging content. You've heard the noise, right? Another AI blah blah blah. Yeah, the content is quite humanized. It reads
10:20:53
decently. It's frontloaded the keyword. It's a pretty long article as well. Let's see how long that is with one
10:20:58
prompt. Whoa, it just blasted out 2,000 words in one shot. That is crazy. Yeah, for content writing is pretty good as
10:21:05
well. Let's just test it out in terms of AI detectability. Just going to plug this in here. I know, for example, when I've tested this out with other models
10:21:12
recently, they come out undetectable completely. That one is not bad. It still passes the AI detector, but it's
10:21:18
coming out at 12.3%. Which is not as good as I've seen from other models. Let's see how it's
10:21:24
performing on LM Marina as well. So, if we have a look at the leaderboard here, we've got Gemini 2.5 Pro. Again, yeah, I
10:21:32
would agree. I think 2.5 Pro is definitely a superior model. Obviously, it's more expensive to code with. Chat
10:21:37
GPT coming out second. Grock 3 and GPT 4.5. And then you got Flash Preview
10:21:43
coming in at what joint second right there. Not bad at all. Google are
10:21:49
dominating. Look at the top five. Google and OpenAI absolutely dominating. Let's just go back to the benchmarks and see
10:21:55
which one is the best for maths. So we got the Amy maths test over here. So if we have a look, Gemini 2.5 Flash, 78%,
10:22:03
Gemini 2.0 Flash, that's a huge difference. It's a massive step up from its previous counterpart. OpenAI04 mini
10:22:10
though is just destroying maths. Look at that. Like it's absolutely destroying
10:22:15
everyone. Gro 3 beta says 93%. But when I've tested Gro 3 recently, I wasn't
10:22:21
that impressed to be honest. So I think if you're going to pick any model for maths, just go with open AI4 Mini. Seems
10:22:29
to be a lot better. Let's see how much it costs in our end. If we go back into open router and we'll go inside activity
10:22:38
just check what the pricing is. So when we're using it to give you an example right if we're using claw 3.7 sonet it's
10:22:45
going to rinse us for credits. So we start using something like Gemini 2.5 flash you can see here 0.00262.
10:22:54
So it's super cheap but also look at the speed here. So you see the speed is 142
10:22:59
tokens per second. Compare that to something like Plaude, which is 53
10:23:04
tokens per second when I've used it previously. GPT4.1 82.4
10:23:10
tokens per second. So, you know, in terms of speed, I don't think you're going to beat Flash from what I've seen.
10:23:16
199 tokens per second there. So, it seems a lot faster and it's a lot
10:23:21
cheaper to code with as well. I want to see as well, is it directly available inside NA10? So, we'll go inside our
10:23:27
workflows inside NA10 and just have a cheeky ganda here. Sign in. See what we got. So, let's see here. I'm going to
10:23:33
clone this Optimus Alpha AI agent. We'll duplicate that. And we'll call this
10:23:39
Gemini 2.5 Flash agent inside NA10. If you want to get all my best workflows,
10:23:45
by the way, for NA10, we've got tons inside the AI profit boardroom. Just go inside the classroom and then go to the
10:23:53
NA10 template section here. And you can see like we've got a redonkulous amount of NA10 templates that you can steal
10:23:59
from us. So let's have a look here. We're going to switch this now to Google 2.5 Flash and we just use preview not
10:24:06
thinking and just test this out. All right. So this just super basic agent just like a helpful assistant. I just
10:24:12
want to see how it performs, how fast it is, etc. Yeah, it's pretty quick, isn't it? It's pretty quick. That might be one
10:24:18
of your best AI workflows for creating like customer chat bots and stuff on the website because you could just deploy
10:24:24
this. It's going to be really fast. You load up the AI agent with all your best knowledge, etc. inside the memory or
10:24:31
inside the system message. And also, yeah, you should be good to go on that. Really easy and simple to set up. Let's
10:24:36
see what other people are saying about this. So, if we go over to Twitter, so Logan announced Gemini Temple via Flash
10:24:42
here. Our first unified reasoning model with thinking budgets. I do the fact that it gives you options on thinking
10:24:48
budgets and that sort of thing. If you compare here, so this is the arena score. So, LM arena score versus the
10:24:54
price and you can see 2.5 flash is right at the top in terms of arena score, but
10:25:01
also way cheaper than your average sort of models to use. Let's give it something a bit more advanced now. So,
10:25:07
what I'm going to say, and this is something that works really well inside Gemini 2.5 Pro. If we go to the SAP
10:25:14
section, then we're going to scroll down and to the master list of prompts and
10:25:19
we're going to create an interactive water molecule simulation. So to do
10:25:25
this, I'm going to use canvas inside 2.5 Flash. See what we get back. In the
10:25:31
meantime, just in case that doesn't work, we'll use the chat. Also, what's interesting inside AI Studio now,
10:25:37
they've separated each model. So you got 2.5, Gemini 2 preview, Gemini 1.5, and
10:25:43
Gemini Gemma, right? So if we go to preview models, you've got a couple of options there, but obviously we want to
10:25:49
be using 250 preview. Now, this we're going to use the thinking mode. We can
10:25:56
set a thinking budget. So we can switch this around here. And then let's plug that in. Hit enter and see what we get back in a sec. There we go. That's
10:26:03
That's pretty good to be fair. Let's speed this bad boy up. Slow it down. Yeah, that worked perfectly, didn't it? pretty good. Let's build Flappy Bird, a
10:26:10
classic. By the way, if you want to see like real business use cases, cuz obviously these prompts are f fun and nice and that sort of thing, but if you
10:26:17
actually want to see, okay, how we implementing all this stuff inside our business and actually making money with it, then check out the crash course
10:26:23
inside the classroom with the AI profit boardroom. So, if you go in here, you'll see all these different methods that
10:26:29
we've used to automate. So, for example, like automating emails, our customer service and sales team. They've been
10:26:35
able to automate a lot of their emails using this module right here. We have Twitter automations, newsletter, shorts,
10:26:41
avatar videos, Fathom, Zappier, etc. Like loads of cool stuff in there if you want to check it out. So, let's go back.
10:26:47
We've got Flappy Bird ready to go. Is that working? It doesn't seem to have done anything, right? Yeah, it's okay.
10:26:53
It's okay. It's not amazing, but I think it'll be really good for developers because if it's cheap to build apps
10:26:59
with, then obviously SAS is going to become a lot more profitable to build AI apps with, and so that could lead to
10:27:05
good things. But from what I've seen, it's okay. It's not as good as Gemini Pro 2.5 experimental. It is cheap for
10:27:13
developers. You do seem to be able to use it for free inside AI Studio.
10:27:19
It can give decent outputs. Like for example, the interactive water molecule
10:27:24
simulation, but would I switch between these? I probably wouldn't use it in videos. It's probably just going to let
10:27:30
me down. When I'm using it inside automations, it's going to let me down quickly, but it might be really good as
10:27:36
well for NA10 workflows cuz it's super fast and cheap to use inside there. All right, so thanks so much for watching.
10:27:42

10:28:46
based on all our happy clients like you can see right here. Thanks so much for watching. Appreciate it and I'll see you
10:28:51
on the next one. Cheers. Bye-bye. Cursor and Gemini 2.5 Pro are absolutely
10:28:57
insane. And I actually just built this Tetris game in one single click. I'll show you exactly how to do it, but it
10:29:03
works perfectly. So, you can see here, for example, we've got all the pieces of Tetris puzzle. We can move them around.
10:29:11
We can switch these back in over here. And this is just working beautifully.
10:29:16
All right. It's incredibly easy to set this up using Gemini Pro. Now, I actually think from what I've seen on
10:29:22
the tests and when I've been building with it, Gemini Pro seems to actually be better than Claude in many ways, Claude
10:29:28
3.7 Sonic. But the difference is, of course, if you're coding directly with AI Studio and AI Studio.google.com,
10:29:36
then you can actually get free API. So, you can code for free using this and then build whatever you want like games,
10:29:41
tools, apps, websites. This is just one silly little example, but you can see how easy it is and it features functions
10:29:48
perfectly. All right. So, if you want to set something like this up, what you can do is you can download cursor and then
10:29:54
inside cursor for example, literally all we said was like create a Tetris game
10:30:01
right here. And then you can see it went off and coded it and created the logic. And then we've actually got the index
10:30:08
html ready to go. And if you want to choose Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental, you
10:30:14
just click it down here. You can also switch between auto select. So cursor can switch between them and you can also
10:30:20
enable thinking but for this project I didn't even enable thinking. It was really simple and easy to do. And then
10:30:25
it coded out the HTML over here. And if we open that up in Finder. So we'll open that up. And then if we grab a new
10:30:32
Chrome, plug this in over here. You can see it's ready to go. If you actually want to
10:30:38
host something like this, you can go over to Netlifi. So we can log into Netlefi over here.
10:30:45
Add a new site. import an existing project. Grab the folder. All right. So, you just
10:30:50
grab that folder and then plug it into Netify Drop right here. Pretty simple
10:30:56
stuff. Really easy to do. So, let's try and build some more stuff with this. Right now, just going to open up new
10:31:02
tab. Let's new chat over here. We've got Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. And I'm
10:31:08
going to say, okay, create a really sleek and interesting keyword research tool.
10:31:16
for SEO. Make the design the best it can be. All right.
10:31:23
And then I'm going to say okay and promote these links
10:31:28
with Alex forosi style sales copyrighting throughout. And then we'll
10:31:33
put the funnel links underneath like you can see.
10:31:38
And then all we need to do here is just hit send and that should start doing its magic. All right. Now you can use
10:31:45
something like for example Visual Studio Code and then you can start from there
10:31:50
using R code or client to build something similar but honestly it's going to run
10:31:56
out of tries pretty quickly. That's the problem is like when you're building stuff out with the main API from Gemini
10:32:03
it seems to hit the limit on requests really quickly. So for example, if we select Google Gemini Pro Experimental
10:32:08
inside, for example, Root Code here, we'll test out the results side by side.
10:32:14
So I'll take exactly the same prompt and we'll test the results. All right, so
10:32:19
we're going to plug this into Visual Studio Code. We're using Google Gemini to build that
10:32:24
out and we'll see what it comes back with in a second. All right, so you see here how there's an error. Super annoy.
10:32:31
So we've hit the limits, it says resource exhausted. And so that's the problem right now. It seems like the API
10:32:36
is just being rinsed and super hard to use. Whereas, for example, we've got the
10:32:43
file ready to go. So it's created the HTML, etc. to make this fully
10:32:49
functional, blah blah blah. We'll accept all the files. Let's just see what that looks like so far. So plug this on a new
10:32:56
tab, grab the index.html, and there we go. Keyword research tool ready to go.
10:33:02
Let's press this now. Is it working? Yeah. Look at that. Perfect. All right. So, if you compare the difference here,
10:33:08
like cursor is way better for coding with Gemini 2.5 Pro. Obviously, this is mock data. So, you would want to insert
10:33:15
like API integration. We can actually do that in a second. And then you can see on the page here, it's got links to our
10:33:20
funnels. Right now, if you compare this versus what RO did. So, if we go back to
10:33:26
Visual Studio Code, I am a big fan of R code actually. But you can see here how
10:33:31
it's not going to go off and do stuff for us. Like we have to click run command. We have to mess around quite a bit. Whereas inside cursor, we're good
10:33:37
to go on that, right? We just give it one prompt. It's like boom, here you go. And you've got that page ready to go.
10:33:43
What we can try from here is setting up the API integration. I also like the fact that it's told us this is mock
10:33:49
data, right? So the AI is not trying to mislead us and tell us, oh yeah, this is ready to go, etc. It's just found mock
10:33:56
data. So, what we're going to do now is we'll go back to cursor, open this chat up, and we're going to
10:34:02
say from here, okay, create the back end API integration with
10:34:09
chat GBT API, plus make the design
10:34:16
more modern, interesting, and sleek. And now you can see it's
10:34:21
beginning to code all of that out. So it seems a lot more autonomous whereas for example if we go back to root code here
10:34:27
we have to keep clicking save and go ahead and all that sort of thing. The biggest difference though however of
10:34:34
course is like cursor is like $20 a month for the pro plan like this but if
10:34:39
you get a better result you save time it's 100% worth it whereas for example root code it's free but it's going to
10:34:47
take you more time and then you have to click save and run and everything else as you keep going through this. Also, I
10:34:52
think this will run out of API requests, whereas inside cursor, it's going to start doing its magic pretty quickly.
10:34:59
So, let's see what we got here. Next step is build the back end, integrate the Open AI. Okay. And I'm going to say,
10:35:06
okay, create this, but let the user insert
10:35:11
their own API key into it. So, like you can build your own sort of
10:35:16
SAS tools, apps, or whatever you want using this process. Pretty simple and easy. So it's beginning to do its magic
10:35:22
right here. You can see it's editing the code. Okay. So now it says now the user can enter their keyword and open API
10:35:28
key. When they click find keywords now the browser will directly query the open
10:35:34
AI API key and show the formatted text response from chat GPT in the results area. Remember the security implications
10:35:41
of the front end only approach. If you use front end instead of creating like a whole backend server obviously it's
10:35:48
going to be a lot faster and easier to implement. So, what we're going to do is we're going to rightclick index.html. Bear in mind, like I'm not really a
10:35:55
cursor expert, but it's pretty easy to set up, right? Like, it's quite intuitive. It's really easy and clean to
10:36:00
set up. So, now we can insert the API key and we can plug in our keyword. So, I'm just going to grab from
10:36:09
OpenAI an API key here. All right. So, if we go to platform.opai.com
10:36:15
and I'll grab an API key. Just go to dashboard and then API keys over here.
10:36:20
Hit create new secret key. Obviously, I'm going to delete this afterwards, but I'm just showing you it as an example.
10:36:26
And let's just check this actually works cuz sometimes you can build this stuff out with, for example,
10:36:32
bolt, but bolt new and tools like that, like they often break when you're using the API key. So, let's see what we get
10:36:38
here. We're going to click find keywords. Now, it's asking the AI. It looks like it's actually used the AI.
10:36:43
So, it worked perfectly first time round, but you see how the UI is number one, not that nice. Number two, it
10:36:50
should be generating the results really here. Like, we need to make it cleaner. So, I'm just going to take these actions and put it here and say make
10:37:01
cleaner, more modern, and better designed.
10:37:07
Make it the best it can be for front end design, right? Then for the keyword results,
10:37:16
make this feel like a beautiful sastl. What else do we need to do here? So, we're going to go back here. Yeah, it's
10:37:23
just super bland right now the way it's designed. And also, there's like lots of space on the page. So much space on the
10:37:29
page. And it's way too bland. I'm also going to say also give me search volumes,
10:37:36
keyword difficulty, etc. from keyword research
10:37:42
the best you can possibly be. So the other cool thing here as well is like we can switch between API keys
10:37:48
really quickly. So you know if we wanted to say use claw 3.7 sonet max which is
10:37:54
typically better for front end and usually more expensive but we're using this inside cursor so it should be a lot
10:38:00
easier then we should be able to get better results. We can switch between them or we can
10:38:06
just use think auto select and get it to do that. It's magic right there. But it's pretty good as well. So, let's see
10:38:11
what we get back here. I also like the speed of this. Like, you can see how fast this is. Whereas, you know, quite
10:38:17
often if you're using R code, Rico has not even created the tool yet. We're still waiting for that to be done.
10:38:23
This requires like a lot more button pressing and just going to yes, approve, etc. Even when it's selected on auto
10:38:29
approve. So, it's created this tool. So, this is the tool from Brew Code. If we hit run command here, let's see what we
10:38:35
got. I actually prefer to be fair the front end of Rode for the tool is much nicer than the front end from cursor
10:38:43
which is pretty interesting. But let's go back here. We'll type this in. See what we got. It's got a nice little CTA
10:38:50
there as well. And we didn't have to prompt it properly for that either. Let's go back to cursor. All right. So,
10:38:56
it's promising me that this will be a lot nicer. Let's have a look see what we got here. So, we open up the new
10:39:03
version. Plug it in. Here we go. And we've got the keyword. Let's grab
10:39:11
the API key. Hit find keywords. And it's generating over here. So, it
10:39:17
does look better. It's not perfect, but this looks a lot nicer than it was previously. So, it says find winning
10:39:23
keywords, AICO, find keywords, plugged in the API key. Works perfectly. Still
10:39:28
got some nice CTAs here. I just think we need to change the color scheme of the page, but it's looking decent. And then
10:39:34
we've got the keywords and estimated volume and all that sort of thing. It also says found gold. Turn those keywords into cash. Learn the SEO elite
10:39:41
circle blueprint at the bottom. So, we're beginning to get something that looks better, right? It's got a lot more
10:39:48
functionality than it did previously. Like this is the old version. It was pretty nasty, but this version is a lot
10:39:53
nicer. So, let's go back now. And I'm going to say, okay, the design has to be
10:40:01
more beautiful, sleek, interesting, and modern. Right now, the
10:40:08
page background is just white, and it doesn't feel modern at all. I
10:40:14
say, could you create something that's really sleek, like for example,
10:40:20
the UI of Airbnb, something like that. Give you some examples. See if that improves it. We'll wait for that to
10:40:27
generate. See what we get back. But you can see the evolution is pretty big between the first generation versus the
10:40:33
generation that came after that. Looks a lot nicer with all these ratings and that sort of thing. Here we go. Open
10:40:39
that up. I hope this looks a lot nicer. Let's see what we get. It's just not
10:40:45
that interesting, is it? So average. All right. Here's what we're going to do. So
10:40:52
I'm going to say using my brand colors. I say add like animations
10:40:58
relevant SEO icons make the page fun interesting book 10.
10:41:06
This is a 100 million SAS tool.
10:41:12
I think part of the game here is like just figuring out what prompts are going to get the best out of this page. So
10:41:18
going to run that again. does seem insistent on just having a blank white screen, which doesn't make any sense at
10:41:25
all. The images are looking better. I mean, the buttons here are looking better. Let's see what we get back. Now,
10:41:31
in the meantime, I'm just going to open up a new window. And what you can also do, if you go to your settings over here, is you've got a bunch of new
10:41:38
features, right? So, for example, if you go to MCP over here, you can actually add MCP servers inside Cursor as well.
10:41:44
And then you have it looks like you have to create an MCP file for that to work.
10:41:50
Also got a bunch of features here. Some new rules. So you can add like different rules inside here as well. And then you
10:41:57
can select which keys you want to use. Now if you want to use your Google API key directly, you can just plug in here.
10:42:02
Same for Anthropic and OpenAI as well and Azure. So Azure will help you. I
10:42:07
think you can for example like host that through the Azure API. And then there's
10:42:14
also a bunch of new features here. I've not used this for a while, so that's why I'm saying, but you've got, for example, like the web search tool.
10:42:21
You have all these sort of auto excepts or partial excepts. And yeah, it's
10:42:28
definitely improved a lot since I last used cursor. So, let's go back here. We should have this ready to go. There we
10:42:34
go. Now we're talking. Now we're talking, my friends. All right. So, let's try this again. Now, grab this API
10:42:41
key. Plug it in here. We'll put, for example, SEO agency.
10:42:47
Hit find keywords. Do these links work? Yeah, we're good to go on those.
10:42:54
Beautiful. And then you can see on the results here, it's broken it down. So, we've got
10:43:00
the keyword phase, SEO, agency, estimated volume, difficulty, CPC, andformational, right? So, whether it's
10:43:06
like, for example, a commercial intent, navigational, informational, etc. And we're good to go on that. And then yeah,
10:43:12
that is looking a lot nicer. I think that's actually probably ready to deploy. So what we're going to do from
10:43:17
here is we shall let's go down here. Let's have
10:43:24
a look. So if we go into this review on Finder going to copy those files
10:43:33
and then we'll create a new folder and we'll call this keyword tool.
10:43:39
All right. And then I'll show you how to deploy this as well. So if we paste in those files over here. All right. And
10:43:45
then we're going to go over to Netlify and I'll deploy this so that you can use it as well if you want to. All right. So
10:43:50
we'll import this. Try nifi drop. We'll grab the folder that we just created.
10:43:57
Just plug that in. Wait for that to upload. And then boom. Look at that. It's hosted
10:44:04
on a subdomain. So we got that ready to go. It's hosted at netify.app. You can test out if you want to. You just copy
10:44:09
that URL. I'll include it inside the AI profit boardroom as well along with an SP if you want to steal this from me.
10:44:14
But essentially, that's how easy it is to create like a nice looking SAS tool that works with an API key using cursor
10:44:20
and Gemini 2.5 Pro, right? And also, you can see how easy it was to
10:44:26
build Tetris using this process. Like you can build apps, tools, games,
10:44:31
whatever. And Gemini seems to be a lot better for building games out, right? Really simple and easy to do. So, thanks
10:44:38
so much for watching. If you want to get the SP from today, feel free to get that inside the AI profit boardroom. This
10:44:44
comes with all of my best workflows, tips, SPS, templates, agent templates, etc. And I'll include an SP inside the
10:44:51

10:45:58
description. The new Google Gemini 2.5 Pro update just released at Kraken and
10:46:05
it is absolutely free. All right, so what I'm going to show you now is how to build a game where we can just drive a
10:46:12
car around and you know there's all sorts of crazy examples. I'll show you how to build like a full chess game and all sorts of
10:46:19
crazy stuff in a second. You know, we can drive around. We can do whatever we want. We can go through this little
10:46:24
train bit here. We can build crazy stuff. Go backwards and forwards. All right. And it's really easy to build
10:46:30
this stuff out, right? I think it's just bugged out completely there, but you get the point. So, let me show you exactly
10:46:35
how to build it. And this is based on the new update that just came out like a couple of days ago from Gemini 2.5 Pro.
10:46:42
I think honestly most people don't understand how powerful this is and how much of a game changer it is, right?
10:46:48
It's it's totally changed everything because not only is this like an awesome thinking model, not only is it beating,
10:46:54
for example, powerful AI models like Claude in its benchmarks, but it's also
10:47:00
incredibly powerful for like building out coding and taking an idea that you have in your head and turning it into
10:47:06
reality, right? So, you can see it in terms of the benchmarks here. It's pretty much outperforming all the main models for most of the benchmarks here.
10:47:12
So for example like humanity's last exam or Amy maths test is outperforming some
10:47:18
of the most powerful models in the world but at the same time it is completely free to use right so if you want to go
10:47:23
to a studio.google.com you can click on create prompt and then from here you can just type in your prompt and whatever
10:47:29
you want to do. The other way that you can do this is you can grab an API key like you see right here. Then we can
10:47:34
navigate to something like Visual Studio Code. And inside Visual Studio Code, we
10:47:39
can start coding with the API inside extensions like client and ruode. Right?
10:47:45
So if we go to the settings over here, we can select to open router Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. And it's
10:47:51
free. Doesn't cost you anything, but it's the best AI model in the world. How is that possible? And yeah, you can use
10:47:56
it completely free inside a studio.google.com. The other thing to note here is if you
10:48:02
go into gemini.google google.com/app. That's going to be paid, right? So, you
10:48:08
have to pay for the model inside Gemini Advanced if you want to use 2.5 Pro Experimental. Don't do that. Instead, do
10:48:14
this. Go to AI Studio, go to create prompt, and then in the model section over here, go to Gemini 2.5 Pro
10:48:20
Experimental, and you can select whatever you want, right? And it is literally breaking the internet. Let me show you some examples. Right? So, a lot
10:48:27
of people are saying this is literally the best model for code. So, it's extremely powerful. 1 million token
10:48:32
context doesn't just agree with you. Flash is a genius, etc. Great tweet from McKay Wriggsley. You can also see some
10:48:38
of the other stuff people are building. So like this dinosaur game, I actually build that as well. And I'll show you exactly how to do it in a sec. And you
10:48:44
know, people even building like crazy plane flight simulators like you can see
10:48:49
right here. And it's not just limited to coding. It can do so much more. But that just gives you an idea of how powerful
10:48:54
this is. And wow, my video just popped up right there as well. That's what we like. Julian Goldie rep in here. All
10:49:00
right. So, let me show you some other cool stuff. So, for example, Punam Sony, she did this awesome tweet on like the
10:49:06
comparisons. So, you got Gemini 2.5 Pro over here versus GPT01 Pro. Like, which
10:49:11
one is doing a better job? For sure, if you look at the realism here, I'm going to go with Gemini 2.5 Pro, right? Like
10:49:18
the physics and everything else look 10 times nicer versus GP01 Pro, right? And
10:49:24
that's the difference here. It's like one of them's just better at coding, one of them creates better options, right? this car game we actually just created
10:49:32
and I'm going to run you through like some of the best prompts and how you can build this stuff out right now. Okay. So, let me show you some examples of
10:49:38
what we built. So, if you want to build the 3D car simulator, all you're going to do, simple stuff. You just say, can
10:49:44
you create a simple 3D car simulator with 3.js and single HTML? Add clouds,
10:49:50
mountains, roads, some trees, and a train going around. Right? Make sure it works on mobile. It's going to use its
10:49:55
thinking mode like you see right here. we have 2.5 Pro experimental figured out. And then once you've done that,
10:50:01
you're going to see all of this right here. Okay. Now, this is actually coded in HTML. So, all you're going to do is I
10:50:08
mean there's two options here. You can download it and then you can actually grab that code, drag it in here, and
10:50:14
start using it like so. Or the other option is you can go over to something
10:50:20
like LiveWeave, as you can see right here, and start using it that way. And if it ever breaks or anything like that,
10:50:25
just refresh the page and you're ready to go on that. Okay, pretty amazing stuff. Now, it's probably not going to
10:50:32
be like perfect first time around, but you get the point. Like, it's incredibly easy to do. It looks pretty cool.
10:50:38
Graphics are super nice, and it did it in one shot as well, right? Like, there's no there's no messing around
10:50:44
here. Like, it just it literally did it. Let's see if we can crash into that. All right, there we go.
10:50:51
And then if you want to keep building out the rest of the game, you can just go back inside a studio.google.com and start doing this
10:50:58
magic. All right, so that's how to build prompt one. I'll include all the prompts inside the AI profit boardroom if you want to get that link inside the
10:51:04
description if you want to use this stuff. But yeah, incredibly easy, very, very fast. So let me show you how easy and fast it is actually to generate
10:51:11
this. So if we take that exact same prompt and we'll start a new chat now. So we'll create prompt. Then we're going to click on this and we shall say okay,
10:51:18
same thing, right? I like to press command and return just to send that quickly over. You've got a timer here.
10:51:23
So, it shows you how long it takes to respond, right? So, if you actually open up the
10:51:29
thinking, it's thinking out the whole process, etc. Looking at how long it takes and you can see it's using this
10:51:35
magic right there. So, it's going to plan out and reason this. This is not a base model. So, for example, something like DeepSync version 3, the new
10:51:41
version, that is a base model, which means it's not designed for reasoning, right? Whereas if you use for example
10:51:47
something like this, this is a reason model which means it's much better for coding, much better for maths etc.
10:51:52
Right? And you can see how quick it's generating that code. Like it's incredibly fast. So it blasts it out. I
10:51:59
mean it's going to be quite a lot of code but it pretty much codes it perfectly. And
10:52:05
the good thing about this is you don't even need to be able to code or understand this stuff. All you need to be able to do is just download the HTML
10:52:11
file and then drag it into a new tab. Right? Like that's pretty much it. So, it's still coding out right now. Let's
10:52:17
see what we're up to. Finished off. All right. So, that took 66 seconds to generate this game. Now, imagine if
10:52:23
someone was coding that out. How long would this take? Absolutely. To think about it and someone very skilled as well. Right now, what you can do is you
10:52:30
can click the download option here. Got the download ready to go. And then we'll drag it in. And we have the game ready
10:52:38
to load. Right. Pretty simple stuff. So if you want to build other stuff,
10:52:45
here's another example. So this is fully working chess game in HTML. All right.
10:52:50
So we ask it to generate a fully working chess game. Now, if we go back to liveweave.com, we'll delete that and
10:52:57
then we'll plug this in. And we have the chess game. All right, chess game ready to go. So the code is in the top left.
10:53:04
All we need to do is copy and paste HTML, nothing else. And then let's test this works. So can we play? It looks
10:53:11
like we can, right? So, I can't move as a black cuz it's a white's turn. So, let's try that out again now. There we
10:53:17
go. And it gives you the move history as well on the right hand side. Again, this was coded out in one single prompt.
10:53:22
Absolutely wild. So, we just said make a fully working chess game in HTML. It's like here you go. Just go off and use
10:53:28
it, right? No messing around, no back and forth prompting or anything like that. So, if we move the the black pawn
10:53:33
over here, we can decide to move forward or we can move to the left hand side.
10:53:39
And yeah, incredibly easy. We can also move that and it works perfectly, right? How cool is that? How amazing is that?
10:53:46
So, there's all sorts of crazy stuff you can build with this. This is just a start. Let me show you some other stuff. So, you can see here, this was an
10:53:53
awesome tweet from Petri. I don't want to even try and pronounce his surname, but awesome tweet. Make sure you follow
10:53:58
him on Twitter. And you can see he built like this Space Invaders game. All right, so let's try and test the same
10:54:04
prompt out now. And I actually did that earlier. as you can see right here. So,
10:54:09
I copied and pasted the same prompt from Petri like you can see and really simple
10:54:15
and easy. Coded out as HTML again. All right. And then we're going to take
10:54:22
that code, copy that over. We'll go back to Live Weave. All right.
10:54:29
We'll paste that in. Let's see if this works. So, we've got the Space Invader
10:54:34
controls at the bottom. And then you can see here now it's working perfectly. All right. And then I think we want to
10:54:40
collect these health scores. So yeah. Yeah. We just collect the health scores.
10:54:45
And then we're having a a jolly good time here, peeps. All right. I'm live streaming and
10:54:51
coding and building out games. And it's effortless.
10:54:56
And I didn't spend like 20 years learning how to code either. All right. So that's how cool this is, how powerful
10:55:03
it is, etc. And we get little speed boosts as well. and it works perfectly. Now, I honestly
10:55:09
believe the Gemini 2.5 is the most powerful in the world for coding. I I
10:55:16
think it's going to be very hard to beat this, right? Like considering it's free as well and considering you can get an
10:55:22
API and start coding with it. The only thing that would make it better is of course like if you could open source it, but Google never going to do that. Like
10:55:28
that's the secret source, I guess. I don't see Google We ever open sourcing this model, but it's super powerful
10:55:36
stuff. All right. And yeah, you can also, for example, go into
10:55:43
Visual Studio Code. Let me show you how to use this. So, you want to download a visual download Visual Studio Code at
10:55:50
code.visisualstudio.com. Then from there, once you've installed it, go to extensions and then from
10:55:56
there, I think client is really good. client of Root Code. Pretty good. Root Code is one of my favorites, too. So, if
10:56:02
we select the Root Code icon on the left once you've installed it, then we're going to go to settings and then we're
10:56:07
going to select Google Gemini Pro Experimental. Right? Now, the way to do
10:56:12
this is two different options. You can number one, insert your Google Gemini API key, right? So, you' go to a
10:56:19
studio.google.com, click on get API key, and then from here, create API key, and you can grab
10:56:25
an API key right there. Right? completely free to use. So you can grab one like that or you can do is you can
10:56:32
go back to here and you can select open router. Right now if you
10:56:39
select open router inside the API key section here you just go to openrooout.ai. Let me show you how to do
10:56:44
that. There you go. And then once you've done that select keys at the top right
10:56:49
once you've signed in and created an account click create key and you'll be able to use the Gemini model. All right.
10:56:56
So if we go back with our API key, we would plug it in here. Select Google
10:57:01
Gemini. And you see how it says colon free here. That means it's free. Free to
10:57:06
use. All right. So once you've done that, we can hit save. We can hit done. This is a multimodal model as well. So
10:57:13
for example, that means that if we have something in mind that we want to create, then we can easily do it. So for
10:57:18
example, let's go back to live. If we go back to live reef here with the HTML from the
10:57:25
Space Invaders game. All right, we could take that, grab that image, copy it
10:57:32
here, go back into Visual Studio Code, paste in that image that we just created, and say, "Okay, clone this game
10:57:40
and recreate it in a simple HTML file."
10:57:46
Right? Now, the benefit of this is that when you're doing this, and again, you
10:57:52
see how there's some errors with the API key. So, if there's some errors like that, you can just go back here, select
10:57:57
Google, and then select Google Gemini. But you can see it's going off and doing its magic, right? So, the way that you
10:58:02
can do this, and we'll hit we'll allow that. We'll hit save. There is that when
10:58:08
you're doing this, like you can save it locally. That means that if when you reopen Visual Studio Code, you've got
10:58:13
the code ready to save locally. So that's the benefit of using this instead of like Google AI studio which is going
10:58:19
to save everything on your account but you don't have it like to re-edit later and that sort of thing be a lot harder to find that. So that's basically how to
10:58:27
build and create anything that you want. You know the new update from Gemini 2.5 Pro from what I've seen for coding
10:58:33
specifically is better than any other AI model out there and it doesn't cost you a penny. But yeah it's an absolute
10:58:39
gamecher. So, if you want all the prompts from today and the examples, etc. I'll include that inside the AI
10:58:46
profit boardroom link in the comments and description, prices going up this month, this is a community all focused on saving time and making more money
10:58:54
with AI. So, if you want to learn how to do that, feel free to get this stuff. And inside the SAP section here, we've
10:59:00
got tons of training courses on, for example, like how to build anything with Gemini 2.5 Pro, including how to set up
10:59:06
like AR Studio and how to use and build anything with Gemini 2.5 Pro in 9 or 10
10:59:11
different ways, like you can see. And also, we've got a full course on like DeepS 3.1, NA10, MCP agents, whatever
10:59:20
you want to learn pretty much when it comes to AI is all inside here. So, feel free to get that link in the comments description. And inside the community,
10:59:26
you can ask 578 members anything that you want about AI. So if you get strugg

11:00:31
you watching and thanks. Bye-bye. New Gemini 2.5 Pro, how to build
11:00:38
anything. So, today what I'm going to show you is how to build basically anything in many different ways using
11:00:44
the latest update that just came out 24 hours ago from Gemini 2.5 Pro. And the
11:00:49
coolest thing about this is actually free to use if you have the right techniques. I'll show you exactly how to do that. By the way, if you want all of
11:00:55
the for the stuff that I show you today, you can get it inside the AI profit boardroom. Just go down to Gemini Pro
11:01:01
2.5 Pro down here and you can get access to everything right here, including all these techniques I'm about to show you.
11:01:07
I'm going to show you nine different ways to build anything that you want using Gemini 2.5 Pro. And we're going to
11:01:13
kick it off with something interesting called Bolt DIY. Now, BoltDIY is a
11:01:20
really power to start using AI to build stuff locally, right? And it's kind of
11:01:27
like bolt. But bolt new is a paid tool where you have to pay to build SAS or apps or that sort of thing. But you can
11:01:32
actually use it for free directly inside Bolt Local. So, let me show you exactly how to set this up, how it works, etc.
11:01:38
First thing that you're going to do is you're going to go to terminal, right? And then inside terminal, let me show
11:01:43
you how to do this. By the way, if you want access to all this stuff, you want to learn how to do this stuff, get it inside the AI profit boardroom. I've got
11:01:50
full recipes and all this stuff and how to do it right here. And we're just going to get straight into this. All right. So, if you want to start coding
11:01:58
locally with Gemini 2.5 Pro to build apps, games, tools, etc., then you can
11:02:03
use this terminal command like you can see right here. And then we're going to mpm install like you can see. Just going
11:02:10
to paste that in. Then from here, we're going to use this. All right. Next up,
11:02:16
what we're going to do is npm rum dev. That bad boy. All right. And then that's just going to start running this boom
11:02:22
shaft. That was easy, wasn't it? Then what we're going to do is we're going to open this up. So this is running locally now. It's kind of like a free version of
11:02:28
bolt new, right? So you don't need to pay for this. It's completely free to use. And if you select open router in
11:02:35
the settings right here, scroll down, you can get access to the latest version of Google Gemini 2.5 experimental,
11:02:43
right? And this is how you can start coding stuff, right? So you can switch to Google over here, but I can't see 2.5
11:02:50
Pro experimental in the list. So the best way to use this start coding with the API key, which is going to connect
11:02:56
Google and its AI to bolt new bolt.local. Then you just select Gemini Pro 2.5
11:03:04
experimental for free down here. And then what we need to do from this part is start getting an API key and plugging
11:03:10
it in. Right? So you see where it says open router API key. That's where we're going to get an API key and plug this in. Now if you want to get an API key,
11:03:17
pretty simple stuff. So you're going to go to open router.ai and you can get a free API key and then use this for free.
11:03:23
All right. So if you go to the key section over here, we can just click create a key. I'll do that off screen. And then from here we can start getting
11:03:30
into the magic of coding with bolt local. Now even it for example sometimes
11:03:36
with these APIs they don't work right. So you know if it's a beta or if it's just been released like 24 hours ago
11:03:42
sometimes these don't work. But I'm going to plug in this API key. Hopefully it'll work and if it doesn't I'll show you other ways to do this in a sec.
11:03:47
Right? So if we say build a to-do list app inside here. All right we're using
11:03:53
Google Gemini Pro 2.5 experimental. This is starting to build out our app that we
11:03:59
asked it to develop. Right? And you see how fast it is, how easy it is to do using Bolt Local. Sorry, BoltDIY. And
11:04:08
bear in mind, right, if we go onto Bolt new, so that's the to-do list. We'll
11:04:13
come to that in a second. But if we go to Bolt new, you have to pay, right? So if you go to my subscription here, if
11:04:19
you want 10 million tokens, it's $20 a month. You want $26 million tokens, $50 a month.
11:04:25
120 million tokens, $200 a month, right? But if you want very similar functionality completely for free with a
11:04:31
free API, then just set up Bolt DIY and you've seen how I set it up in two seconds. If you want the instructions
11:04:37
for setting that up, it's inside the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description. So from here, we can start
11:04:42
building whatever we want, right? So for example, I've got a to-do list app right here. We type in whatever we want,
11:04:48
right? Figure out Gem Line Pro. Bang it in. We got the list ready to go, right?
11:04:53
And then if you want to for example host this stuff right then what you can do is
11:04:59
you can go back to code over here you download the code right so that's our folder our react folder and then what we
11:05:07
can do from here with that code that we just created is we can actually host it and we can host it for free on a
11:05:12
subdomain. So, if you want to host it for free on a subdomain, you're going to go to netlifi.com and then you're going
11:05:17
to go from here and you're going to click on import an existing project, try netifi drop, and then just drag and drop
11:05:22
that folder that you just downloaded from bolt local. Right? How easy is that? So, incredibly easy. Not just to
11:05:29
build your own app, not just to do it for free, not just to get free access to bold.local, but also to get this bad boy
11:05:35
deployed on a on a subdomain. Pretty crazy stuff. And that literally just
11:05:40
took us like 1 minute or so. So you can see how easy this is, how powerful it is, etc. And you can do it in the space
11:05:47
of like literally minutes to get this stuff deployed in OC and that sort of thing. If you wanted to build a game or
11:05:52
app or whatever, if you go back to bulb DIY here, we can also switch between API keys. So if you want to test stuff out,
11:05:58
there's loads of free stuff here. So if you go down the list, you'll see there's a lot of free ones. So for example, like
11:06:05
Llama 3 AB preview is free. All these ones with brackets and then free, these are free API keys that you can just play
11:06:10
with. But I would recommend Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. It is probably the most powerful API key in the world and you
11:06:17
can get access to it for free, right, for coding stuff. So unbelievably powerful. Build the best SEO cost
11:06:23
calculator you can with a sleek modern design. Wait for that to load. You can
11:06:30
build tools, you can build apps, you can build games, calculators, etc., whatever you want. And it is super super fast. I
11:06:37
also find like this is a lot more reliable than other API keys that are free. Right. So, for example, if you try and use the Deep Seek 3.1 API from Open
11:06:46
Router, it's a little bit slow sometimes, right? Doesn't always do what you want it to do. It's a little bit temperamental. Whereas, for example,
11:06:52
when you're using a process like this, it's simple, it's easy, it doesn't take a long time, and literally in one
11:06:59
prompt, you've got that ready to go. Look at that. Right. Here we go. Boom. Shaka. All right. And then we've got the
11:07:06
SEO cost calculator. You select your services. gives you the estimate monthly cost. Something that you would hire a
11:07:11
team of developers to build and spend thousands of dollars, you can now do for free using Bolt DIY. And that is just
11:07:18
one of the methods that I'm going to show you today. We've got many more to get through, my friends. And again, SPS
11:07:23
are inside here. So, the next method I'm going to show you is on client. Now, client is a free extension inside Visual
11:07:32
Studio Code. All right? So, if you go to visualstudio.com, download this, right? And then what
11:07:38
you're going to do is open this up in Visual Studio Code. That's going to open up something that looks like this. Then
11:07:44
inside the extensions marketplace. So click over here, type in client. Allow that. And you can install I would
11:07:51
recommend installing client and root code. These are two different ways to code. Root code is super powerful cuz you can actually use like computer use
11:07:57
with it as well, which is pretty insane. And also client is really good as well. I like both of those extensions. I think
11:08:03
they're great. And then inside the settings once you've got client installed. So you can see client on the left hand side here. Then you're going
11:08:09
to go inside the settings and then you can input a Google Gemini key like you
11:08:14
can see right here from the list you will not find Gemini 2.5. Right? So if
11:08:19
you want to use Gemini 2.5 instead what you want to do is go to open router and
11:08:25
then inside open router we're going to put 2.5 and we'll look for Google Gemini
11:08:32
2.5. Let's have a look what we got here. Yeah, there you go. All right. So, you can just find it from the list right
11:08:37
there. Let's have a look. Yeah, Gemini. It's called So, it's called Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 03-25
11:08:45
colon free. So, it's free. It's available inside open router. You can use it inside client. And then, you
11:08:50
know, you can use the same prompts you use inside Bolt. So, if we go back to Bolt over here, I'm just going to shut this down because that's probably taking
11:08:57
up a fair bit of memory in the old bolt. All right. So, we'll leave that for now. And that is terminated on the local
11:09:02
host. But we can always go back to the old chat if we run it again. So what we can do from here is we can say now
11:09:09
building an SEO cost calculator. So you can do very similar stuff inside client. But here's what I would say. So when
11:09:16
you're using client, client is a lot slower for building stuff out inside client versus using bolt.loc. So if you
11:09:22
saw the way that I coded bolt.local previously on bolt, way faster. Whereas
11:09:27
if you're using client or root code, it's going to take a bit more time. And I think it's because it's updating files locally and I think as well because it's
11:09:34
running it through the custom instructions that are set up in the settings as well. So you see how it's like writing the content for the page
11:09:39
and it's creating all the content and text for the page as well. Analyzing stuff. I think Gemini Pro is probably
11:09:45
your best bet. Some people are asking like can you use for example for trading and analyzing can you use Deepseek 3.1?
11:09:52
I wouldn't recommend it cuz Deep Seek 3.1 is a base model not a reasoning model. What that means is it's not as
11:09:59
good at thinking and reasoning and logic and coding as something as analytical as Gemini 2.5 Pro. So I would rather use
11:10:07
Gemini 2.5 Pro for analyzing and that sort of thing. Right? So we're coding that out. We're building out websites
11:10:13
using client. You can do exactly the same thing inside root code as well. So if you switch to R code here, you know
11:10:18
this is method number three. You can do exactly the same thing. Again you would select from the list. So you can use
11:10:24
deepseek if you want but again I would always prefer to use Gemini 2.5 Pro and
11:10:29
again you select it from the list hit save. Done. Right. The difference one of the biggest differences between Klein
11:10:36
and Root Code is that Root Code is easier to install MCP servers. Right? So
11:10:44
if you go inside the MCP section over here, it has this MCP server section and then you can see which MCP servers are
11:10:51
running. Right? I'm just going to delete that one for now. But you can see we're using like Plexi ask right here. So we can connect R code directly to Plexi. So
11:10:58
the way they use MCP server is very different, right? Whereas if we go over to client, they actually have an MCP
11:11:05
servers marketplace and then you can use the Gemini 2.5 Pro API to install MCP
11:11:12
servers such as connecting it to stuff like Google Calendar, Discord. I've
11:11:17
connected it to Perplexi. Oama is another good one. There's lots of good stuff right there. And this is
11:11:22
completely free, right? So just to recap here, we've talked about three different methods. All right, we've talked about
11:11:29
using Bolt Local, which is free and you can build anything using that. You can also, for example, use Klein, Brew Code.
11:11:36
These are many different options. All right, let's keep going down the list cuz we got a lot to get through here, peeps. All right, so this is something
11:11:45
that I'm going to recommend called make.com. Make.com is really good for like linear workflows. All right. So,
11:11:50
you can build like AI agents using mate.com. And I'm just going to grab a password
11:11:56
here. All right. We'll plug that in. And we'll log in to make.com. Wait for that
11:12:02
to load. And what we can do is build like AI agents with Gemini 2.5 Pro. All right. So, let me show you an example of
11:12:09
what we built yesterday using similar sort of processes. So, for example,
11:12:14
we've got where have we got here? So, we've got tools like this. This is actually made with Deep Seek, but we can
11:12:20
duplicate it. So, I'm going to clone this right now. Call this Gemini 2.5
11:12:25
content creator. Copy. Right. Hit save. And then what we're doing is we're taking keywords from a spreadsheet,
11:12:32
plugging that for Open Router, sending to WordPress. Right now, inside the settings for Open Router here, we have
11:12:38
the prompt for generating the content. We have this connected to Open Router. And then we're just going to scroll down
11:12:44
here. And instead of using Deep Sea V3, I'm going to switch this over to Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. Right there, you
11:12:51
can see it. We're going to hit save. So again, you just add your open router connection, your WordPress connection,
11:12:57
and your Google Sheet connection insidemate.com. And you can build like oneclick AI agency using this process as
11:13:03
well. So this is method number four for using Gemini 2.5 Pro. And then for example, if we choose where to start
11:13:09
over here, we're going to choose manually from our spreadsheet of keywords. This is an AI SEO content
11:13:14
writer. You can use this for whatever you want, right? Like you could take keywords and then plug it through open
11:13:19
router and then do tweets or LinkedIn content. You could automate emails. You could fire off emails to to potential
11:13:27
prospects, whatever you want. Okay, we're going to hit save on that and then we're going to hit run once and then we
11:13:33
can start using this process. Now, let's have a look here. What's going on here? Why have we not why is this not working?
11:13:38
I'm just going to switch my open router connection. Make sure we're using the right model. We'll test that again.
11:13:44
There we go. All right. So, that's working nicely. Now, if you want to see an example of the output, think of this
11:13:49
is because the other API connection I had inside open router was the old
11:13:55
connection and I've actually deleted the API key since then. So, if we log into my WordPress over here, whilst we're
11:14:01
waiting for that to load, I'll show you some examples of what I did yesterday using the exact same process. So, here's
11:14:07
a Gemini Pro experimental example. We're going to click on preview. We've got the content and then you can see it's just
11:14:13
created like a nicely formatted blog. Reads pretty nicely. It's interesting. It's all targeted to the keyword we
11:14:19
wanted to write SEO content about. And this was free, right? Make.com is free for a,000 operations. Google Sheets is
11:14:26
free to use. WordPress is free to use. Open router is free to use. And it's using the laces API keys from Gemini.
11:14:32
Okay. Now, if we take that and we'll go over to zero GPT. We'll plug that in and
11:14:37
we'll just check the AI detectability on that. Is it AI detectable? No. Zero GPT,
11:14:44
which is an AI detector is free and it is detecting this is 100% 98% human
11:14:51
written. It says your text is human written, right? So, automated content. It's all customized to us, nicely
11:14:56
formatted, doesn't cost us anything. We did it in one click and it all links out to our personalized funnels like you can
11:15:01
see right here. Right, pretty amazing stuff. Plus, it can publish automatically for us as well if you want. So, that's how the whole process
11:15:08
works. You can see it worked quite cleanly there. And if you want my best automations for that, go inside the AI
11:15:13
profit boardroom. We've got like a whole module on make.com automations and there's 12 different templates you can
11:15:20
get inside there. So, make sure you get that stuff. All right. So just to recap, we've talked about boltdy, client,
11:15:26
ruode, we've talked about mg.com. You can also just go directly inside the chat, right? So if you go to a
11:15:31
studio.google.com and then you select Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental over here, create a prompt,
11:15:38
you can just build whatever you want inside here. Now, if you want to see an example of that, let me show you an example right here. So I'm just going to
11:15:45
go through the library. What else we got? Yeah, so I created like a pixelated dinosaur game yesterday, right? So here
11:15:53
you can see the code. I just went to Gemini 2.5 Pro. I said, "Make me a
11:15:59
captivating endless runner game." Blah blah blah. Do it in 5JS. It gave us a code right here. We can copy that. So
11:16:07
we'll copy that to clipboard. And then it even gives us the instructions on how to get this set up.
11:16:13
So if we scroll up here, we're going to go to editor.p5js.org.
11:16:19
Let's go to that website. Copy that. We'll paste in the code. We'll hit play. Boom. Game built. Right. Pixelated
11:16:26
dinosaur game. Live the dream sunshine. All right. And you can now build games
11:16:32
as well for free with Gemini 2.5 Pro. So that's another method as well. Like you
11:16:37
got so many different options right here. Choose the one that works the best for you. Depends on what you're building as well, right? So for example, if you
11:16:43
just want to build a simple game, then you're probably going to use something like AI Studio. If you need to build
11:16:49
like a really big website, you're probably going to use client or root code for that. If you want to build out a SAS app like super fast, then all you
11:16:56
need to do is you can just go over to Bolt Local and just build that out for
11:17:02
free, right? So many different options depending on what you want. If you have a linear automation like this and you
11:17:08
need to post from one platform to another one, then make.com is really good for that. Next up, what I want to
11:17:13
show you is browser agent web UI. All right. Now, I've actually set this up
11:17:18
with Deep Seek. The instructions are inside the AI profit boardroom, but you don't need to use Deep Seek. You can use
11:17:24
Gemini 2.5 Pro and then I'm going to show you an example video tutorial of this so you can see exactly how it runs.
11:17:32
I'm not going to show it live on this video cuz it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to set up. All right, but you
11:17:38
can basically set up browser web UI like you can see right here. You would plug in the LM provider as Google, not as
11:17:46
OAMA, right? And then like you can see right here, it can just go off and start
11:17:52
doing stuff for you. All right, so check out that video. It's on YouTube. You can see how the AI analyzes the page. The
11:17:58
good thing about Google's Gemini model as well is it's a vision based model, so it can do its magic just like that. And
11:18:03
again, instructions inside the AI profit boardroom. Next up, what I want to show you is you can use deep research agents,
11:18:10
right? So, if you want to build like really in-depth research reports, you can go to deep research inside Gemini.
11:18:16
This is another free feature as well. It's not necessarily using Gemini 2.5 Pro, but if you need like the best
11:18:21
research better than a human, faster than a human, this is how you do it, right? So, for example, if we say, okay,
11:18:28
research the latest chat GBT40 image update, he
11:18:34
should start working his magic. And the cool thing about this is you got everything inside one ecosystem, right?
11:18:40
So, for example, you need to do deep research, boom, there you go. You need to do something like personalization
11:18:47
based on your search history, boom, there you go. If you want to build out some tasks with like maybe a website or
11:18:53
a SAS or a landing page, then just go to 2.0 Flash and use the canvas feature. Like everything is what in one side, one
11:19:00
one ecosystem, one place. And that's the beauty of this is you're not going from place to place and messing around like
11:19:06
that. So, if we hit start research like so, we can build out these deep research AI agents that can just go off search
11:19:12
the internet. We can leave that tab running in the background as well if it's taking too long for you. And then
11:19:17
we can just go off and do that. All right. The final two methods I want to
11:19:22
show you cuz I've shown you all these different methods already. Number one is
11:19:28
using NA10, right? So if we go over to NA10 over here, you can actually create
11:19:33
AI agents directly inside NA10. And these are kind of like oneclick chat bots or workflows where you can connect
11:19:40
different apps to each other. Difference between say something like NA10 and make.com is that NA10 is not linear,
11:19:46
right? And you can build your own chat bots inside it. Whereas make.com is very like you go from point A to point B,
11:19:52
boom, straight line, right? So for example, let's have a look at this workflow that I actually built out
11:19:57
yesterday. If we have a look at this one, I'm just going to check the open mar chat model and we're going to select
11:20:02
instead over here Gemini 2.5. Let's have a look here. Put 2.5 Pro.
11:20:09
Yeah, there we go. So, you're going to select Gemini 2.5 Pro XPend experimental like you see right inside the AI model.
11:20:16
And we have a AI agent where you can essentially like automate sending emails or going back and forth inside the chat.
11:20:22
You can also add a memory in here as well. So you can add a memory that allows it to remember previous messages
11:20:28
so that it remembers stuff that's going on. If you want to publish this, you can also make this chat publicly available.
11:20:35
Grab that URL, publish the workflow, and you've got a chatbot that you can share with the world or embed to your website,
11:20:41
etc. And then if we go inside the chat here, we'll say, "All right, we send a message to me at julianoldie.com
11:20:49
telling there's new ways to build anything you want with Gemini 2.5 Pro
11:20:55
Experimental." And then I'll list out all these different methods here using this keep
11:21:02
it fun plus conversation. And then from there, we can start building this out. The other way that we can do this, we
11:21:08
can delete the open router chat model if the API key doesn't work. I told you it' be temperamental sometimes. Right. So if
11:21:14
that's if you're having any problems with that, you can add inside here. Let's X off that. What are you doing,
11:21:19
mate? All right. Click on chat model over here. Click on Google Gemini chat model. And then you can select 2.5 Pro
11:21:27
Experimental. Give it the same chat message. And now it's using Google Gemini to generate that response like
11:21:34
you can see. So the chat model is working. Actually, what's interesting is you go inside Visual Studio Code and
11:21:40
client and open router works perfectly with Gemini. Whereas for example, if you go over to NA10 and try and do the same
11:21:47
thing, it's better to have a Google Gemini chat head from what I can see because that API key worked perfectly
11:21:52
first time around. Right? So we're good to go on that. I'm going to hit save on that. If you want to download this template from me, if you want to just
11:21:59
steal this stuff from me, I'm going to download that and I'll plug it into this section right here. So, add a new
11:22:06
resource file. And if you want to just import this workflow, it's waiting for you right there. And it's an example.
11:22:13
We'll hit save. Boom. There you go. All right. And then if we check our emails
11:22:20
in the send box, here we go. Look at that. Sent it right there. The only thing that I would say here is make sure
11:22:26
you write it in HTML and make sure the output is in HTML as well because then the formatting is going to be much nicer. You get the point, right? If I
11:22:33
say write it and send it in HTML. Hopefully the formatting will be much
11:22:38
better this time. So, let's wait for that to load. And again, like you can connect this to any tool. I'm just
11:22:44
giving you a quick example for the video. If you want to see all my best templates for this stuff, type in NA10
11:22:50
into the AI profit boardroom search feature here. And then you'll see all these NA10 agent workflows. Like you see
11:22:56
all these different resources here. We've got loads of different AI agents. Like you can see here as well. NA10
11:23:03
sales agents. Like it's not limited to just sending emails. It's just for the sake of this video that I do that.
11:23:09
Right. So if we go back now to NA10 should have sent. Let's double check the
11:23:15
send messages here. Yeah, there we go. Look at that. Beautiful. Couldn't have written that title better myself. That's
11:23:21
a perfect one for YouTube, right? That's ready to go. And then you can see it's just written it nicely formatted. So, just make sure you output it in HTML
11:23:27
inside the prompt settings. And then it's done magic, isn't it? And then we've got the deep research report ready
11:23:34
to go. Back enable ready there. So, that's pretty cool. All right. So, this
11:23:39
is the deep research report we were talking about earlier. It takes about 5 10 minutes to go and then we're good to go on that. And the final method that I
11:23:47
want to show you. All right. Hit a long video this one. Been through a lot of different methods to build anything with
11:23:53
Gemini 2.5 Pro. So what you going to do with this app right here is you can
11:23:58
select inside the models Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental. And then we can say build
11:24:03
me a calculator app like you can see. We'll hit enter over there. and it will
11:24:09
just build out the app. Kind of similar to Bolt Local, but it's not going to be as big a product with as many different
11:24:15
features, right? And it might take a little bit longer, but yeah, you can see how you can just get started with this.
11:24:21
The good thing about this is like you don't need to use the terminal to get this all set up and you can turn your idea into an app for free using this
11:24:28
process. How easy was that? So, there you go. You got the calculator. It's a better designed calculator than Windows
11:24:34
used to have a few years ago to be honest with you. And you just did it with AI. Boom. Right. Right. If you open up the sandbox as well, we can open this
11:24:40
up and we've got the code ready to go. There we go. Right. So, we've talked about nine different ways to build
11:24:46
anything that you want with Gemini 2.5 Pro. All the SPS are inside the AI profit boardroom, including all the instructions, NA10 agent workflows, etc.

like you can see right here right feel free to get that link in the comments in description completely free for you my
11:26:11
friends Gemini 2.5 the new update as you can see right here versus Claude versus
11:26:18
chat GPT who wins we're going to be comparing them side by side and testing which ones are the best got a bunch of
11:26:26
different tests and use cases to check this through. Let's see how it goes. All right. First thing that we're going to do is we're going to test this prompt
11:26:33
right here for writing content. All right. So, we're going to say write a 2,000word article. The feature of AI agents, the impact on automation, etc.
11:26:39
And we'll hit this into each option like you can see right here. All right. So, we're going to be testing this out
11:26:44
versus each of these models. Use chat GPT4 cuz that's kind of like the default one for writing inside chat GPT. And
11:26:50
then we'll see which one comes back with the outputs and performs the best. First thing I would say is Grock has come back
11:26:56
to us and seems to be the fastest. But actually, if you look at the content itself, look at those big walls of text.
11:27:02
Look at the way it's written, right? Would anyone actually read that block? And so for me, that's one of the worst
11:27:09
that I've seen so far. Let's have a look what we got here from chat GBT40.
11:27:14
So, this is pretty nice the way it's written. So, what is an AI agent? It's dumb down the language, made it nicely formatted, made it really easy to read
11:27:21
as you can see right here, and that's performing pretty well. and playing English. An AI agent and software that takes action for you based on goals or
11:27:26
prompts. You an objective, it decides what to do next. Pretty nicely written. Feels very humanized. It's still writing
11:27:32
out, but you can see how fast it is. And it's also doing like the 2,000 words you ask it to. So, that is doing a great job. Let's have a look at Claude. Claude
11:27:39
is one of my favorite ones if you give it the right prompt. But, if you give it a prompt like this, look at this. Just
11:27:44
really long, boring walls of text. I'm going to put that as coming in third. I
11:27:49
think maybe slightly better than Grock, but not as good as Chat GPT. And then we
11:27:54
got Gemini has written a blog here, but that is more like a deep research report, right? Who would read that? And
11:28:01
so out of all them, I'm going to say that Chat GPT is winning by a long way, right? Long, long way. So when it comes
11:28:06
to writing, pretty good. Now, one thing that I would just note here is if you
11:28:14
give it the right prompt, I've got this prompt inside the AI profit boardroom here. If you give it a better prompt, Claude is actually pretty good for
11:28:20
writing. But it seems like if you don't have the right prompts in place, look at how bad that is compared to the output
11:28:26
from chat GPT that required basically no prompting at all. Huge difference right
11:28:31
there. All right. So, next up, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go into
11:28:36
each and I'm going to say, okay, new chat, create a beautiful
11:28:43
landing page for my SEO agency's website. All right. Now, one thing to
11:28:50
note here is if you want to use Gemini 2.5 Pro for free, you can do that inside AI Studio. Go to create prompt, then
11:28:56
select Gemini 2.5 Pro, and you can get access to this for free. All right. So,
11:29:02
you know, that's one of the other options I would say here is all of these models are free up to a limit, but
11:29:08
actually if you use AI Studio, that doesn't seem to have a limit. Like, you can use it for free as much as you want,
11:29:13
peeps. All right. So, we're going to go back here now. We'll do the same inside Grock as well. The cool thing about
11:29:20
Claude is it has a canvas option. So does chat GPT. And let's go back here. What we're
11:29:27
actually going to do is use 2.0 O flash for generating this inside Google cuz that's a canvas option. We'll hit enter
11:29:33
and we'll see what we get back in a second. All right, so now we've got the code back from chat GPT. Let's run this.
11:29:39
See how it looks. It's not bad. The content itself actually reads really well. Right. That's better written than
11:29:46
most people. It's got a nice little CCA to put in your website URL. Nicely designed icons. I don't like the front
11:29:51
end so much cuz it's super boring in terms of the way that it's done. Claude is still writing. Grock didn't even
11:29:58
figure out we need HTML. So that's going to finish last again for me to be honest. It's been a brutal test for
11:30:04
Grock already to be honest with you. And we're going to keep going through this. So you can see the output from Grock
11:30:10
here. It said I can't directly generate HTML or CSS, which is mad because Grock
11:30:16
can, right? It genuinely can, but it's refusing to. So Grock has to come last on that test. It's just no good. I don't
11:30:23
know why, but Gemini is written in Chinese characters. The design is pretty
11:30:29
nice, but for some reason, it's written it all in Chinese. Why? Why have you done that? I've never seen that before.
11:30:36
All right, let's go back to chat. GBT is winning just by default for writing in English. But look at that from Claude.
11:30:43
Claude has created the best so far. Nicely designed, looks really cool, good
11:30:50
UI. I like the color gradients on it. Nice copy as well. So, dominate search
11:30:55
results with data driven SEO. Really nice headline. So, in this order, here's what I'm going to say. Claude has won
11:31:02
that by a long way. Chat GPT comes in second. Not bad at all. It just could do
11:31:08
a bit of color on the page, but you could always go back in the chat right there. Gemini totally failed and gave us
11:31:13
something in Chinese, and I still don't understand why. That's a bit mad. And then Grock said, "I can't create HTML
11:31:20
for you." Even though it's got a preview section inside Grock 3 for HTML. It just
11:31:26
didn't understand. Right. So, out of all these, he's going to go applaud, I would say, for doing this stuff, which is
11:31:31
crazy. I don't understand. Like, Grock seems to have got worse or something like that. So, let's keep going now. And
11:31:38
next, what we're going to do is we're actually going to use a prompt from the AI profit boardroom for creating games.
11:31:46
All right. So, we're going to go inside the classroom here. And I've already done this inside AI Studio. So, I don't
11:31:51
need to do this with Gemini 2.5 Pro yet, but I will do it with the rest. Okay.
11:31:57
So, we're going to go inside Claude here, and I'm going to say, make me a captivating endless runner game. Key
11:32:02
instructions on screen. Use P5 JSON HTML pixelated dinosaur and interesting backgrounds. Right. We'll use the same
11:32:08
inside Cha Chiba T40. Grock, I just I don't know what it's going to come back to me with. Oh, yeah. Look, it's
11:32:14
actually doing its magic now. That is surprising. And then if you want to see the output from Gemini 2.5 Pro that I've
11:32:21
already done. Let me come back to this right here. So this is the prompt that I
11:32:26
used yesterday. We'll scroll down and we will get this code and I'll show you
11:32:32
what we got back from Gemini 2.5 Pro. All right. So if you want to preview code like this, if you're using the same
11:32:37
prompts as me, you can plug this into editor.p5js.org.
11:32:42
And then inside here, we can hit play. And you can see that we've got this bad
11:32:48
boy ready to go. All right. Looks pretty cool. Nice little game. Functions perfectly. Quite addictive. And we've
11:32:55
got the score racking up in the top right over there. And then it works perfectly. If you want to restart, we press enter. Press space to start here.
11:33:02
Boom. Beautiful. All right. Really good from Google Gemini. So, they've done a great
11:33:10
job there. Claude is still coming back to us. Chat GPT has come back now. So, let's see what we got back from chat
11:33:16
GPT. We'll copy the code and we'll test this one. So, this is a code from chat GPT. Let's see what we got back. What is
11:33:23
that UI? I can't jump or anything. It says, yeah, that's pretty poor. That is
11:33:28
not a dinosaur, mate. Not a pixelated dinosaur and definitely not a dinosaur. Claude is still coding it out, so wait
11:33:34
for that. And we have the code back from Grock 3 as well. So, let's see what we get back here.
11:33:40
So far, Gemini is winning by a long way. The UI is not quite as nice here. You
11:33:46
see how it's green on green, but it works. It's definitely better than Chat GBT's option. It's better. It's not
11:33:52
quite as fast and as smooth. If you look at the UI of this versus the UI of Gemini, this looks a lot nicer to be
11:33:59
fair to it. So far, what I would say is that Gro is coming in second. So far,
11:34:06
Gemini is winning. Chat GBT, I didn't like the UI at all. Let's have a look
11:34:12
what we got back from Claude. Is it opening up? It's giving us a preview, but there's nothing inside the preview,
11:34:19
which is strange. All right, so we're just going to copy this code and we'll go to P5JS and just preview this again
11:34:26
to see how Claude performed. Pixelated Dino Runner. Let's test it out. Not bad,
11:34:32
actually. That is a hard game to play, though. Look at that. How are you meant to That's hard, mate. Yeah, I like it
11:34:41
though. Not going to lie to you. So, I would say that if it was actually beatable because it seems like it's
11:34:47
almost impossible to beat that, then I would probably put that number one or joint first. I would say that Claude and
11:34:53
Gemini did a fantastic job there. Gro's output was okay. Mediocre, I'm going to
11:35:00
put that number three. Chat GPT's UI pretty terrible. It's just a block with a bit of text, right? Not great. So you
11:35:08
can see who's winning there and who won the game right there. All right. So let's keep going through now. So we've
11:35:13
tested it for content writing, for coding out landing pages. We've tested each of these models for
11:35:20
creating content and also building out games as well. What are we going to do
11:35:26
next? So the next one that we're going to do is this is going to be kind of like a reasoning test. So we're going to
11:35:32
go inside claude and reset for each one here. Switch back to 2.5 Pro
11:35:37
Experimental inside Google and we say there's a tree on the other side of a river in winter. How can I pick an apple? It's a reasoning test. And what
11:35:44
we're trying to do here is figure out, okay, which one is the best for reasoning logic? Which one gives us the best solutions? And which one most
11:35:50
intelligently looks up problem and then gives us solutions, right? So, we're just waiting for each one to come back
11:35:57
to us right now and we'll see who performs best. So, let's see what we got here. All right. So it's recognized that
11:36:04
the biggest challenge is apples in winter. So obviously in winter if you're trying to pick trees on the other side
11:36:09
of a river, it's not going to be ideal, right? Because quite likely even if you
11:36:14
cross the river, there's going to be no apples in winter. So it's figured that out. It's analyzed the situation really
11:36:20
well and it's given us a bunch of solutions right here. Pretty good. Let's check out now. Claude has recognized the
11:36:26
same, but it doesn't analyze it in the same level of depth. Right? So for example, if you compare Gemini 2.5 Pro,
11:36:31
he's really thought about it. He's given us a really in-depth answer. It's analyzed all the problems and solutions and the conclusion etc. I would say
11:36:38
Claude doesn't do that in as much detail. If we have a look at Grock, it's
11:36:44
recognized apples typically don't grow in winter. But I don't like the way the
11:36:49
the answer is not logically set out. Right? So if you look at you've got these titles, it's really easy to read.
11:36:56
I honestly I think that Grock has been tuned down in terms of its reasoning. Like it just doesn't seem to be as
11:37:02
powerful as it was when it was first released. I would say that is harder to read than this one right here. And it's
11:37:07
just not as logical as well reasoned out. And let's have a look at chat GPT. So let's break this down. It's an apple.
11:37:15
There's a tree. It's across a river. It's winter. So let's look through it step by step. But the biggest problem
11:37:21
here is it's not figured out that there's actually no tree. There's no
11:37:27
apples in winter on the tree, right? It's not figured that out when it's done all this analyzing. So, if I had to put
11:37:34
these in order, I'm going to go with Gemini, then Claude, then Gro 3, and Chat GBT40 comes last. Now, if we wanted
11:37:42
to give this a fairer way of comparing each model, then what I would actually
11:37:47
recommend doing is you switch to 01 and use one of the reason models. And to be honest, if we did that, we'll probably
11:37:52
get much better outputs. But I believe doesn't chat GPT. Let me have a look at
11:37:58
this. No. So, yeah, if you wanted to switch this over to, for example, 03 mini, let's test it out now and we'll
11:38:05
see if that figures out. So, we're using chat cheapy 03 mini. He's going to use his re reasoning model to figure this
11:38:11
out. That's even worse, isn't it? Look at the quality and responses of chat03
11:38:18
mini versus Gemini. Like it it's totally night and day. So let's have a look
11:38:24
here. Says worried about crossing a cold icy river in winter. Wondering blah blah blah. And it still doesn't recognize
11:38:30
that there's no apples on a tree in winter. All right. So chat cheap is mini
11:38:36
using the most powerful reason model. has is not as powerful as Gemini 2.5 advanced. Right? So again, chat G chy
11:38:43
comes in last whether you're using GT40 or whether you're using mini still down
11:38:49
my friends. All right. So you can see the difference between the models how well they perform etc. The other thing
11:38:55
is as well inside chat GPT40 we're going to test this out now. This is really
11:39:01
interesting test so we can do step by step. We're going to do a test. So, I actually used this morning using chat
11:39:08
and the new image generation method. All right. Now, Claude automatically fails
11:39:13
on this test or isn't even in the race here because it cannot generate images. So, you can't even count Claude at this
11:39:19
point, right? But what we can do is we can test each of these models and chat
11:39:25
is given me a really good option right here for image generation. All right. So what we're going to do inside Grock is
11:39:32
we're going to use exactly the same prompt we used inside chat GPT and we said create a landscape YouTube thumbnail like this but it should be
11:39:38
regarding the end of designers about new chat GP update that means we don't need designers anymore and I'm going to plug
11:39:43
this in across each of the models right so the output from chat GT was top class
11:39:49
I've never seen anything as good as this from any other AI model it was unbelievable really powerful just from
11:39:54
the newest update from chat cheapy let's do the same thing inside gro Okay. So,
11:39:59
if we go inside Grock here and we'll just we'll start a new chat just to keep
11:40:05
things fresh. We'll grab that image that we use inside the chat GBT prompt. We're
11:40:10
going to use that inside Gemini. Obviously, Claude is out the race and we'll see how it does. All right, this
11:40:18
one might take a minute or so whilst we're waiting. And from what I can see, the output from Gemini 2.5, not very
11:40:26
good. Not very good at all. If we compare what we should have got versus
11:40:32
what actually came back, not that great. If we use maybe we use like the actual main version 2.0 flash. Let's test that
11:40:38
again. So I'm going to re retest this. Grock as well has not done anything near as good as chat GPT. Right? Look at the
11:40:45
output from chat GBT versus the output from Grock. This is I can't use that.
11:40:51
You know what I mean? Can't use that. So you can see the differences here. And
11:40:56
you can see that Grock is nowhere near the same level as chat GBT. Let's have a look at Gemini and we'll use 2.0 Flash
11:41:02
instead. So, we'll use exactly the same prompt. Let's grab the image over here. Plug that into Gemini and then we'll do
11:41:08
the same thing and see what we get back. Yeah, look at that. It's just come back with a text message. Where's the image,
11:41:15
mate? So, not great there. Yeah, if you compare all the models here, 2.5 Pro's response was pretty poor. Grock didn't
11:41:24
create anything near the same level of quality and Claude obviously can't do that at
11:41:30
all. So, hands down, Chat GBT delivers like designer level quality responses,
11:41:36
right? Like I can just download that, boom, upload it to YouTube, it's over. It's game over. You don't need a
11:41:42
designer, right? That's the biggest difference here. And I think whatever you use for images, GT4 is like the new
11:41:49
standard for all this stuff. So, thanks so much for watching. If you want to get access to my best prompts, tips,

appreciate you watching and I will see you on the next one. Thank you. Google Gemini 2.5 versus Deepseek V3.1.
11:43:21
All right, so in the last 24 hours, Google Gemini have just released their latest model, which is Gemini 2.5 Pro
11:43:28
Experimental. As you can see right here, you can actually get free access to it. And you can also access Deep Seek as
11:43:34
well for free. So, they have DeepSeek V3.1 and that is available to access at
11:43:39
deepseat.com. You can also get free APIs for both of them and we'll be testing those out in a second. And basically
11:43:45
what we're going to be doing today is just comparing them side by side. So, these are the two latest AI updates, the
11:43:51
two biggest ones in the game I would say. And today we're going to be testing them out side by side and seeing which
11:43:56
one performs the best. Now, the first thing that we're going to kick off with because I like to give AI a challenge is
11:44:05
by coding a game. All right. So, let me pull up an example right here. What I'm
11:44:12
going to say to both of these models is make me a captivating endless runner game. Key instructions on the screen.
11:44:18
P5Js scene, no HTML. I like pixelated dinosaurs and interesting crowds. Now, I could use it inside Google Gemini, but
11:44:25
this is like the paid version, right? This is the advanced paid version. I want to make keep it fair. I want to
11:44:30
keep it even Stevens on this comparison. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull up Deep Seek V3 side by side versus
11:44:39
Gemini 2.5 Pro and compare which model performs the best. Now, one thing to note here is that Deepseek version 3.1
11:44:46
is not a reasoning model, right? Whereas Gemini 2.5 Pro is a reasoning model. So
11:44:53
there is a significant gap between them, but I've been getting this request to compare them both side by side and
11:44:58
compare the latest recent models. So let's see how they perform. I'm going to hit enter on both of them. So we'll give
11:45:04
them exactly the same prompt right here. The other thing that I was struggling with yesterday, I don't know if anyone else had the same problem as soon as
11:45:11
this came out, was that actually with Deepseek V3.1
11:45:16
after they released a new update, tons of people were on the website, right? And so the servers were absolutely rinsed. It was super slow responding to
11:45:23
us. So, let's see if it gives us better responses today and how it performs.
11:45:28
Here's an example of the difference between a thinking model and a base model. So, this base model with no thinking, it just jumps straight into
11:45:35
answering the question. Whereas, for example, what you can see with Gemini 2.5 Pro is that it really thinks things
11:45:40
out before it does anything, right? And it's going to spend about 10, 20, maybe even 30 seconds doing that before it
11:45:45
finally comes up with the output. So, we've got this back right here. But we've got the example and it's finish
11:45:53
the outputs before Deep Seek, so it's actually a lot faster. Bear in mind, this is free, but Gemini 2.5 Pro is a
11:46:02
lot faster at getting back to us and typically smarter as well. And it gives us instructions on how to run it as well. So, you can see how much slower
11:46:08
Deep Seek V301 is. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to test this out. So, we're going to copy the JS from
11:46:16
Google 2.5 Pro Experimental. We'll plug that in and we'll open this up. All right. So, we're going to hit preview
11:46:22
still. Open this bad boy up. See how it performs. And there we go. We've got the
11:46:28
game ready to go. All right. That was pretty amazing. Incredibly easy to set up. Works perfectly. Actually quite a
11:46:36
fun game as well. That's addictive. So, I'm going to close that now. And now we
11:46:42
have the output back from Deepseek as well. So, let's copy that JavaScript over here. So, let's go into this. We'll
11:46:49
plug it in. We'll open this up. So, this is the version from Deepseek instead.
11:46:55
Let's see what we got. Not bad, actually. Which one would you prefer? I actually think that look at that's
11:47:04
not bad. It's quite hard to see the score in the UI right there, but I do prefer the design. Like, and it's got more flying objects. For some reason,
11:47:10
they put game over there when we didn't have a game over. It's got differences between night and dark, but it's broken.
11:47:17
Look at that. I've not done anything and it just broke and said game over for no reason. It seems to switch between night
11:47:24
and dark like in between each night and day in between each go, but there's not many enemies coming here as well. So,
11:47:29
it's not as addictive as a game. All right, so I'm going to say Gemini 2.5 Pro one there, but not bad at all. Not
11:47:37
bad at all. I'm impressed by Deep Sea V301's response right there. Pretty good
11:47:42
stuff. Next up, what we're going to do is we're going to compare this for the
11:47:49
content creation. All right. So, I'm going to grab an example prompt from the
11:47:57
AI profit boardroom and this is going to be my content prompt. All right. So,
11:48:04
we're going to grab this. So, we'll copy this as you can see. So, this is one of
11:48:09
my favorite prompts for writing SEO content. And we're going to run this through Gemini 2.5 Pro, as you can see.
11:48:17
And we'll put keyword equals SEO training in New York. And then we'll
11:48:24
do the same inside Deep Seek V3. And we'll see which one creates the best content. One of the strange things here
11:48:31
is like Deep Seek has just gone off and started creating a HTML page, which doesn't really make sense cuz we only
11:48:36
want an optimized article. I know why. It's because on the prompt it says creating HTML at the end. That's okay.
11:48:42
All right. We'll see what the performance comes back with in a second. For sure, Gemini, even though it's a
11:48:48
thinking model, this is way faster than DeepSeek. Look how much quicker it is responding versus Deep Seek. This
11:48:54
already finished. Deepseek is still going. All right. So, we're going to test this out now. We'll grab that
11:49:00
content, the HTML, and we'll plug it into the preview over here, and we'll
11:49:06
see which one performs the best. All right. So, if we compare the titles, we got the Gemini 2.5 Pro output over here,
11:49:14
and we have the output from Deep Sea version 3 on the right hand side. Okay. So, if we compare the output, first
11:49:21
thing that I would say is that the title is pretty bad from Gemini Pro, right? So, it said real SEO training in New
11:49:26
York. Stop guessing, start ranking. Pretty average to be honest with you. SEO training New York, the fast track to
11:49:32
dominate search. Not bad at all. Honestly, Claude can write much better headlines than both of these, but you
11:49:37
get the point. And then what we're going to do from here is we'll compare them side by side. So, if we look at the
11:49:42
first line, Deep Seek just feels a lot more humanized in his content writing. So, for example, we see here it says,
11:49:48
"Need SEO training New York that actually works. Not just theory, but battle tested strategies from someone who's built a seven figureure agency."
11:49:54
like that is is not bad at all as that's better than most humans can do as an introduction. If we look at this, it's
11:50:00
like looking for effective SEO training. Effective being like a weird rule
11:50:06
because your website's buried somewhere on page 10. Okay. Tired of SEO gurus selling you fluff. Feeling overwhelmed
11:50:12
by conflicting advice. Yeah, I get it. I just don't think that's as convincing versus deep seats output right here. And
11:50:19
then I really like this bit. Says here's the truth. Most SEO courses waste your time. Mine won't. and it's all personalized to me and want to sell and
11:50:26
it's already selling me from paragraph one. So I would say the output from Deepseek version 3 actually wins in
11:50:32
terms of writing content humanization. I would say both are not as good as the typical content that I get back from
11:50:38
Gemini 2.5 Pro but you get the point. So in terms of coding and this makes sense.
11:50:43
So in terms of coding and building stuff out, Gemini 2.5 Pro definitely seems a
11:50:48
lot better, right? in terms of writing content and humanizing it. Deep Seek version 3 is outperforming both. All
11:50:55
right. So, let's come on to another example. And this time I'm going to say there's a
11:51:03
tree on the other side of the river and I need to pick is apples in winter.
11:51:13
Okay. And then we'll say, but the river is frozen. What do you recommend? All
11:51:20
right. And what we're looking for here is it's like a reasoning challenge. So, we're trying to figure out, okay, can it
11:51:25
come up with solutions? Can it figure out that the trees actually don't have apples in winter and that sort of thing?
11:51:31
But we'll see what it comes back with and see which one. Now, honestly, Google
11:51:36
Gemini 2.5 Pro should smash this. All right. So, you can see here how the
11:51:42
first thing the Gemini 2.5 Pro recommends is like assess the apples
11:51:47
first, mate. Are they like even worth it? Cuz most apples ripen in late summer and winter. Apples steel on the tree in
11:51:53
winter are likely frozen, rotten, overripe, or damaged. All right, so first things first, like why would you
11:51:59
even be picking apples in winter, mate? That's what it's saying. Whereas, for example, if we go over to Deep Seek
11:52:05
version 3, he just doesn't figure out. So, let's check the ice thickness. Let's get over the river. It doesn't really
11:52:11
recognize that actually in winter there are no apples on the tree. So you can
11:52:18
see the difference here. This is certainly a lot better for reasoning, a lot smarter also for speed here. It's a
11:52:23
lot faster, right? It's a lot faster when we get the outputs. So let's keep going right now. So in terms of just to
11:52:29
recap here, in terms of coding, Gemini 2.5 Pro wins, right? For reasoning,
11:52:36
Google wins. And for writing content, Deep See version 3 wins. So now what
11:52:43
we're going to do is we are going to
11:52:49
test this out for the API. All right. Now the way that we're going to do this
11:52:54
is I'm going to go over to open router keys and I've created a API key from
11:53:01
open router. All right. And then what we can do inside Visual Studio Code is we
11:53:06
can say to root code inside the settings use Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental for now
11:53:12
and we'll say create the best possible SEO ROI calculator you can both for UI
11:53:22
and functionality. All right. And that's going to use the API key from Gemini 2.5
11:53:28
Pro as you can see. And you can see here that actually the API request has
11:53:34
failed. So even though this key is free to use inside open router, it's actually
11:53:39
not working inside client when we test it out. Now if we switch to the settings
11:53:44
and we'll test if deepseats works. All right. All right. So, we'll switch over to Deepseek. And then we're going to use
11:53:49
V3 0324, which is the latest update. And we're going to go give it exactly the same prompt. Start new chat. Same
11:53:57
prompt. We're using Deepseek here. We'll see if this works. Here's a moment of truth. Which API key works? Taking its
11:54:05
sweet time. Yeah. So, you can see here it's finally getting back to us. It's super slow to be honest with you. If
11:54:11
you're using the free version of Deepseek, super slow. Look how slow that is to start creating stuff.
11:54:17
Now, let's test out versus Google. All right. So, we're going to go over to select Google Gemini inside the API key
11:54:24
section here. Just going to cancel this. So, we'll cancel that task. We'll go over to the API key. And then what I'm
11:54:29
going to do is select Google Gemini. I'll grab an API key and make sure that
11:54:35
we can use 2.5 Pro Experimental. Is that available here? Actually, can't see it.
11:54:41
Yeah, we can't use 2.5. And let's have a look inside R code. Can we use 2.5 yet
11:54:47
for Google Gemini? No, we cannot, my friends. All right, that settles it. So,
11:54:53
Deepseek might be slow on the API key, but it actually responds. All right, actually works. Whereas, if you're using
11:54:59
2.5 via Open Router as an API key in client or Visual Studio Code, you can't
11:55:04
use it, right? If you're going to be coding with these tools, then I would recommend DeepSeek V3324
11:55:12
simply because it actually works. whereas Google's API is not available inside client or root code yet and also
11:55:19
with open router the API call requests just don't work yet. So that gives you an idea. One thing I want to check as
11:55:25
well is if we compare these side by side it's not available yet but I think that
11:55:30
will come soon which is deepseek v3.1 right so for example deepseek's models
11:55:36
are open source which means that you can host them locally. So, for example, the last version of DeepSeek V3 is available
11:55:42
to host locally with Olama. You can't host V3.1 yet, but I think that is
11:55:48
coming. So, give it a bit of time and that'll be available, I reckon, to download and start using straight away
11:55:55
as well. Now again just to be clear here you can use you can select
11:56:01
Gemini 2.5 Pro on open router as the API key but it's not working when you call
11:56:08
it. So if if we go into root code here we'll select
11:56:13
Gemini 2.5. All right save or you're done. We'll give it the same prompt.
11:56:20
Start a new chat. When I checked it was not working. All right. So let's just
11:56:25
double check. Actually seems to be coming back and working now. Fair play to it. Oh yeah. So I suppose maybe it's
11:56:31
a little bit temperamental, but that seems to work inside root code to be fair. So actually it seems like open
11:56:36
router and root code work really well, but client didn't seem to work right there. So if you're going to code,
11:56:43
Gemini 2.5 Pro works, but use it inside R code. Don't use it inside client. And
11:56:50
then you can get the API keys. And I think that'll be much better for creating content and coding. It seems to be a lot faster than DC version 3's API
11:56:58
key as well. And again, it is free to use as well. So, let's see what it comes back with now in a second. Wait for that
11:57:05
code to load. But then it runs out. Look at that. It runs out right there. Yeah,
11:57:11
look at that. So, we actually just building a simple SEO RAI calculator. The API request gets exhausted. And
11:57:18
also, for some reason, it says it's using Gemini 2.0. O Pro experimental,
11:57:23
but in the settings we've selected 2.5 Pro experimental, so that doesn't make sense either. Just something to be aware
11:57:29
of. It seemed to get itself back on track there, but it seems super buggy, quite slow, quite buggy. I would be
11:57:35
careful using that for now. If you want something super reliable, just use the older versions of Google. You'll probably get better outputs and better
11:57:43
response rates. All right, so thanks so much for watching. If you want to get access to all the prompts, tips,

11:59:14
new update is absolutely insane and you can get access to both of them for free. Let me show you exactly how this works.
11:59:20
Basically, what you're going to do is you're going to set up Bold DIY. If you're not sure how to set it up, you can just follow the instructions of BoltDIY's GitHub page. And if you want
11:59:27
all the video notes on exactly how I set it up, get it in the AI profit board link in the comments description. And from here, once you've got that set up
11:59:33
and running locally, then what you're going to do is once you land on the page, you're going to click on this
11:59:38
dropown list and then click on open router. And you get access to all these different APIs. So you can switch
11:59:43
between them and build whatever you want using AI and you can build tools, websites, apps, whatever you want. It's
11:59:48
pretty amazing. But also inside here, you can select all these new experimental AI models that have just
11:59:55
come out from Google this week. Right? For example, if we look at Google Gemini 2.0 Flash that was creative fe for
12:00:01
February. Now, this is a paid model, but you can actually get a free model. If you type in Google 2.0, you'll see all
12:00:06
these updates that came out February 2025. For example, Google Gemini Pro 2 experimental is free and you can plug it
12:00:13
into Bolt. So, if you want to do that, all you do is you go down the list and you're like, "Okay, let's go for Google
12:00:19
Flash 2.0 experimental completely for free, right?" And then you get Bold DIY for free and you get Google Gemini 2.0
12:00:26
for free and you can build whatever you want. So, what I'm going to show you here now is a new way of prompting Bolt that works really well. As an example of
12:00:33
this, let me show you this landing page that we just created in literally like a minute with one single prompt using the
12:00:39
new method that I've created. So, for example, you see here, let's create this brand new landing page. This links directly to my funnels and it's even got
12:00:46
a UTM so I can track if anyone landed on the page and submitted a response using my website built on bolt. Additionally,
12:00:52
what it's done is actually created images and inserted them into the content. It's customized all the content
12:00:58
in one single prompt directly to me and my agency and who I am and it's built
12:01:03
out like a beautiful landing page that should convert really. So if you want to do the exact same thing, let me show you exactly how to do this. So, I'm going to
12:01:08
grab this prompt like you can see right here. We basically say create a high converting model and SEO optimized
12:01:14
landing page for my SEO agency. Here's a brand colors. Here's some information to include. Here's a whole layout. Right?
12:01:19
There's a very detailed prompt. So, if we actually select that prompt, this is 200. Now, I'll show you how to create
12:01:25
these prompts that work so well on Bolt in a minute. But, if you want to generate the website using Google 2.0
12:01:30
Gemini Flash, you just hit enter. That's going to start coding out the project. And because we've been really specific
12:01:35
on how to build out, what to set up, how to build it all, etc. And because it's customized to me, we're going to get the
12:01:41
best possible outputs that we can. And again, this is free, right? Imagine how much you used to pay for a website
12:01:47
design agency to do this. It would take them weeks. It would take a lot back and forth. You'd have to brief them for
12:01:53
hours and hours, sit in their office, drink their cups of tea. Instead, you can build out a website that's ready to
12:01:58
go like this, and it links directly to our funnel pages. It's all personalized to us. nice little landing page.
12:02:04
Obviously, you would insert the images yourself, but pretty amazing stuff. You can also, for example, go onto bolt new
12:02:11
and use the same prompt and you get a free amount of credits per month. So, I'm actually on the free plan right
12:02:16
here. As you can see, I'm on the free account. I'm not on the pro plan. And you can use the same prompt inside bolt.
12:02:22
New as well, complete for free, like you can see. And then it will even create the images for you. But if you want to use Google Gemini 2.0 as the API and
12:02:30
build it locally, then this is how you do it using Bold DIY. pretty simple and easy. We can build our websites. That's just one example. I'm going to show you
12:02:36
many different examples today. So, let's move on to prompt number two. So, now we're going to create something more complex. This is going to be building
12:02:43
out a fivepage AI agents website. So, again, you can see the prompt here is very detailed, very complex. We're
12:02:50
showing it exactly what to do, what colors to use for the buttons, etc. We're going to enter, and this is
12:02:55
probably one of my most complex prompts I've ever used directly for bulk. That's a 700word prompt to get the best
12:03:02
possible outputs from BoltDIY because if you can give it more complex instructions, then it's more likely to
12:03:07
work first time round. And I'll show you how to automate these prompts in a second. That's building out the pages. You got the about us, the case studies,
12:03:13
the home, the services section, and the contact page. So, one of the best things about Flash Experimental and using
12:03:19
Google Gemini Flash 2.0 experimental is not just that it's free, but also that you can build it locally and is very
12:03:25
fast to respond. Plus, if something's not working, then we could just screenshot the preview. And because
12:03:31
Google Gemini Flash has vision, it can look at the situation and try and fix it. So, if we say troubleshoot with the
12:03:37
screenshot image attached, it's going to rebuild that out. And there we go, fixed it. So, using the vision option, which
12:03:44
is super powerful, we can screenshot the image, plug it back in, say troubleshoot, and it's ah, the image
12:03:49
shows not available. This means there's an error in the code or development server isn't running correctly. Let's ensure the development server is running
12:03:56
and there are no other errors in the console. And then we've got this nice little design sleek modern page like you
12:04:02
can see right here. Again, you would insert your own images so it's not going to create a logo for you and from now. And if we click through these pages, you
12:04:08
can see it's all working nicely. Contact us page as well with the information for our agency and we just automated that in
12:04:15
one click. Pretty crazy stuff. It's even for example insert a case study section and it's good to go. The cool thing is
12:04:20
as well using open router you can switch between different APIs as well. So if you're like, okay, I think the Gemini
12:04:26
gets the basics down and then I want to really develop it with say something more powerful like flawed 3.5 Sonet,
12:04:32
then we can select that over here. Um, we can give it the same prompt and see what we get back from Claude versus
12:04:39
Gemini 3.5 Sonnet. Bear in mind, Gemini 3.5 Sonet is a paid API, so you probably
12:04:45
will get better outputs, but it's not free. Either way, you can build them both locally. You can preview them.
12:04:50
Pretty simple and easy to do. Now, if you're wondering how did we come up with the prompts and that method right there, what I actually did was I just went on
12:04:57
to chat GPT40. I was like for bolt create a prompt that perfectly creates a landing page. Here's my brand colors
12:05:03
include personalized information about me, etc. And then it gives me a really detailed prompt like you can see with all the details. I also said funnel
12:05:09
traffic to this UTM. And then it created a really nice prompt like you can see. Same for the AI agents website. Pretty
12:05:15
simple and easy to do. And if you go back to bolt DIY using claw 3.5 Sonic
12:05:21
again the outputs are paid using this method but it does look slightly better. Either way you get like good outputs from either and that website was
12:05:28
literally automated in what a couple of step in literally one click like pretty amazing that you can do that. We're
12:05:33
going to build a lot more out today but I'm just showing you examples of like how you can create the prompts how you can use bolt DIY what sort of use cases
12:05:40
you have for it plus how to plug in and switch between APIs. Plus, if you're using the Google Gemini Flash thinking
12:05:47
models or flash 2.0 experimental models, then it is super super powerful. Now, if
12:05:52
you want a free tool to just automate all the prompts for you, I'll include that inside the AI profit boardroom so
12:05:57
that when you click get started, you can tell it, okay, what tool are you prompted for? So, we put bolt. Then,
12:06:03
it's going to ask for the details. So, we're going to say, okay, get clients for my AI agency, tone equals fun, and
12:06:11
brand colors equals this. Then it's going to generate the prompt like you can see and you can quickly generate a
12:06:16
prompt that we can then plug back into Bolt. So let's go to BoltDIY over here. We're going to select Gemini Pro
12:06:22
Experimental. It's coding that out. I'll also show you how to build your own apps and tools as well. There's so much you can do with this. The possibilities are
12:06:28
pretty much endless. It's just absolutely amazing what you can do. Now, if you want to simplify it even more, you can say, for example, okay, build a
12:06:34
to-do list app. And let's say you want to build an app, then you can go for like those oneline prompts. And they do work quite often. The only problem is
12:06:40
like you don't get the outputs as personalized as you would like them, right? So, it requires a lot more back
12:06:45
and forth inside the chat once you get the output. For example, we've got the to-do list back. Obviously, it's not in my brand colors. There's no content on
12:06:52
the page, etc., which you would normally do in the pre-prompt, which is why you want to run it through chat. For example, if we say, okay, build an SEO
12:06:59
site with Gemini 2.0. We'll click add, and that's working right there. And then
12:07:05
you can click on delete or complete. So, if we click on complete, it's going to cross it out. If we undo that and click on delete, you can see it's removed from
12:07:12
the to-do list app. So really simple and easy and powerful to use Bold DIY. And again, it's not a paid tool. Like you
12:07:18
it's not, for example, Lovable or Cursor, Wind Surf, all these tools you
12:07:24
eventually have to pay for cuz you're on a premium plan. But using BoltDIY hosting it locally, you also get access
12:07:30
to the chats locally, too. And you can see all your history inside the chats here as well. This goes back as far as
12:07:36
November 2024, right? So you've got all this history that you build up over time. You can come back to it. You can
12:07:42
get back to old projects. Really simple. And also inside the voice chat here, we can also instruct it to use different
12:07:48
things. So if I say, okay, build an SEO cost calculator website that's optimized for Julian Goldie SEO's agency and talk
12:07:57
about what we do, what we sell, etc., and includes some information about our previous case studies. Then we'll hit
12:08:03
enter. And you can see that's basically taken the instructions we gave it. And now it's going to build out that
12:08:08
website, too. So, you can even voice command it and the AI will understand what you're saying like pretty much perfectly. Better than Alexa, to be
12:08:15
fair, even if you've got an English accent like me, and it will code out the website. Like you can see, there seems to be quite a lot of terminal errors,
12:08:22
but I think that's just part of the coding process. And if you just click fix this terminal error there, then it
12:08:28
will just keep going through and fixing that and setting up. Now, I've shown you how to build tools. I've shown you how to build apps. And I've also shown you
12:08:35
how to build websites. I'll also show you how to host them in a second as well. But let's say for example, you want to create a video game as well. You
12:08:41
can plug that into here. And we're going to test out Flash thinking experimental right here. So this should be more like
12:08:47
a reasoning model for getting outputs. Probably going to be a little bit slower for generating the code. But if we get
12:08:53
better outputs and that's okay. And you see here we said bolt prompt for a self-player snake game. Generate a
12:08:59
self-playing snake game using JavaScript and the HTML canvas API. And you can see it's just playing Snake perfectly on
12:09:06
fast mode. Look how fast it's sped up right there. Again, I'm not touching this. I'm not that good at Snake, but
12:09:11
you can see it's just played perfectly right there. And so, even for generating your own games, you can build this out pretty quickly. And it's absolutely
12:09:18
amazing what you can do. You can also create like really nice sales pages, too. So for example, if we take the copy
12:09:24
from my AI profit boardroom and then we'll go inside the chat here and we'll say okay create prompt for the AI profit
12:09:33
boardroom. It's going to generate the content for the landing page right here. Now we'll grab this prompt. We'll go back to B and we'll ask it to generate
12:09:39
that website. And in a minute I'll show you once this is generated how to host the files as well. So how you can
12:09:45
actually get this website live on a custom domain just like you can see for example with this landing page. We built
12:09:51
this with bolt as well and uh it came out really nicely. So look at that. So you got the landing page ready to go.
12:09:57
You could improve the font but the landing page is pretty much there. I would say you just want to add some nice images and that sort of thing. So
12:10:03
there's a couple of things you can do as well. Like you can click on this and you can test a responsive mode. You can actually open this in a popup and that
12:10:11
will allow you to preview the website on mobile as well. just see what it's like. It looks really nice and that would take
12:10:16
you hours to design. Honestly, I know what messing around with like responsive design and everything, it is a total
12:10:22
nightmare. I tell you that for free. So, if you go back to the code section here and then we click on download code,
12:10:28
we've got the folder for the project. Now, if we go to Netify, import an existing project. Try Metify Drop. Grab
12:10:35
that folder that we just downloaded from Bold DIY. Drop it in there. That's going to upload. Wait for it. It might take a
12:10:41
minute. It depends how big the project is as well, but we've got that ready to go. You can also publish this to a
12:10:46
repository and then link the repository to GitHub as well. So if you look at bold DIY, you can click on push to
12:10:52
GitHub, push that project to GitHub and then link it to your repository that way. And then once your site is
12:10:58
deployed, you can click on buy a new domain and you can put in for example the custom domain you want to buy and
12:11:03
then it will give you a list of ideas and you can just choose which one you want to buy. Plus you get a breakdown of how much it's going to cost for the
12:11:09
first year plus a renewal. Additionally, you can see a bunch of different websites we've deployed here. So, for example, this SEO investment calculator
12:11:16
website. If we open that up, that is ready to go. And it will host it on a testing domain. So, it's like a
12:11:21
subdomain of Netifi just if you want to test out. And then once you get a custom domain bought for it, you can get that
12:11:27
set up and hosted. Pretty easy and simple to do. And from what so far actually, I would say that Google Gemini
12:11:32
2.0 Flash thinking experimental seems to be the best API to build these tools on.
12:11:37
And if you don't like the font, for example, like you saw before, the font wasn't that nice to be honest. So I said
12:11:42
improve the font. Did it instantly. Boom. Look at that. Much nicer now. So thanks very much for watching. Like I
12:11:48
said, I'll drop all the prompts from today inside the SB section of the AI profit bordering. You also get the
12:11:53
custom GPT for building those bul prompts, plus the instructions on how to set this up locally and loads of good
12:12:00

12:12:51
one-click AI agents using Google's latest API, Google Gemini 2.0, along
12:12:57
with NA10 are absolutely insane. And you can see all the workflows I've built, for example, like video transcript
12:13:03
creators, feedback loop methods, Gemini 2.0 agents, and today I'm going to show
12:13:08
you exactly how to build out a new workflow completely from scratch based on whatever idea you have. And your only
12:13:14
limitation is your creativity. For example, let's say I have a idea for a
12:13:19
sales agent that can just follow up with leads to just booking a call and they create something super personalized for
12:13:25
each member of my sales team. Let me show you exactly how we can build this out step by step. And this will show you
12:13:30
how NA10 works, how to build your own workflows, how each module works, and how you can connect different apps
12:13:36
together. So, what we're going to do is we're going to start off with a new module here, and we're going to start
12:13:42
with a web hook module. Now, the reason for this is because we're linking it to an app that doesn't have a direct
12:13:49
integration inside NA10. And this is the cool thing about this is you don't have to have for example a module. So even if
12:13:57
NA10 doesn't have a direct module that you can call inside the workflow, that's
12:14:02
okay because with your AI agent, you can create a web hook and that will trigger the workflow instead. Let me show you
12:14:08
exactly what I mean in case that sounds complicated to anyone watching. So we've got a web hook right here. We're going
12:14:13
to say, okay, each time this web hook gets called, it's going to trigger the workflow. So we've got that set up right
12:14:19
here. Then let's say you want to connect that to your CRM, right? So for example, when someone books in a new sales call
12:14:24
through our CRM, go high level. Then we're going to trigger this workflow. So what we can do from here is we're going
12:14:30
to click on start from scratch inside workflows of go high level. And then we're going to add a new trigger which
12:14:36
is basically saying every time a customer books in an appointment, we can choose which calendar we want to select
12:14:42
it from. And then we say, okay, every time someone books in an appointment in this calendar right here, we shall
12:14:49
trigger the web hook that we talked about. Okay, so now it's going to take the web hook and if we go over to NA10,
12:14:57
grab the web hook, plug it in the URL section, save the action, we now have an automation that's going to trigger NA10
12:15:03
based on someone booking in a new appointment. So let's test this out now. We're going to click on test workflow,
12:15:08
and we can run this test right here. And you can see now that the workflow has executed successfully, which means that
12:15:15
the web hook is connected to go high level and we're ready to get this rocking and rolling. Now what I'm going to do is depending on who in the sales
12:15:22
team actually has the sales call assigned to them, we can set up the automation so that the data feeds
12:15:29
through. Right? So for example, if Ellie gets a call booked into her workflow, then we'll draft an email in her inbox.
12:15:35
Right? So if that email is equal to Ellie's email, then we're good to go on this. All right. Now, depending on how
12:15:41
many people you have in the sales team, you can have another filter here which triggers the workflow for someone else
12:15:48
in your team. So we can say, okay, if the email equals Anna's email address, then we'll send an email for her and the
12:15:54
same for anyone else in your team. So you can have multiple branches and connect multiple different email addresses and filter the web hook based
12:16:00
on its existed data. You could also do this for example for budget, right? For example, let's say in your application
12:16:06
form, this isn't just applicable for go high level. It's applicable for whatever form you're taking data from, but inside
12:16:13
this section right here, if you had a question like, okay, how much you willing to spend and the spend was below
12:16:18
how much you wanted to take in each month as a client, then you could have an automatic disqualification or sorry,
12:16:24
email personalized to them and their situation. All right, we've set up the web hook. We've connected this to go
12:16:29
halo. We'll set up the filter so it goes to the right sales rep in the team. Then from here, what we're going to do is we
12:16:36
are going to have an AI agent. So we'll click on AI agent over here. And if you're wondering how to set that up, you
12:16:42
just click on plus sign, type in AI agent, and boom, you've got this here. Now, what we'll do inside the chat model
12:16:49
is we'll set up a new section that says Google Gemini chat model. And I've already got my credentials plugged in,
12:16:55
but if you ever want to edit yours or you change your API key, etc., you can just change it right here. The host is
12:17:01
going to be this URL. and the API key you just get from AI studio. And the best thing about AI agents built on
12:17:07
Google's AI studio is that these are free to use. Plus, you get access to the latest models, right? So, if we create a
12:17:13
new API key inside AI studio.google.com, then we're good to go on that. And inside the create a prompt section here,
12:17:20
as you can see, we get access to all these different models, right? So, it's absolutely amazing. You get the latest access to the best models from Google
12:17:27
API, one of the biggest companies in the world, and it doesn't cost you a penny. And then you can see you can select which model you want down here. All
12:17:33
right, from the list. Now you can also see if we have a look through the list that you get options between when they
12:17:39
were last updated. So for example, experimental release February the 5th 2025. So we can grab the latest pro
12:17:47
experimental model from Google and use that to fill in our workflow.
12:17:52
Additionally, what we can do is inside the memory section here, we can have a window buffer that remembers the last
12:17:58
few emails we have. Right? So, for example, if you've got multiple emails being drafted based on what you've
12:18:03
previously sent, then you can add a window buffer memory section here. You don't need to set up any credentials.
12:18:09
You can decide how many past interactions the model was based on and it feeds in the latest information based
12:18:15
on the workflow and what happened previously, right? So, it's going to take the information from the web hook. It's going to filter it down to the
12:18:20
relevant sales rep. Then we're going to say inside here, we're going to add a new message that says you are our sales
12:18:26
rep based on the application from our sales prospect, write a very
12:18:32
personalized email that checks the lead is attending the sales call plus makes
12:18:38
it easy for them to confirm. All right. And then we're going to feed in the previous workflows from the node. So
12:18:44
let's click on test step here. All right. And we just had to go back to go high level test a workflow again with
12:18:50
some dummy data. that's fed in the details. And then inside our AI agent
12:18:55
here, we just want to define below the recent details, right? Also, just make sure that you've linked these together.
12:19:01
If they're not linked, then this AI agent won't receive the previous data. And each stage, you always want to be testing this step by step, right? Making
12:19:08
sure that the data from the last module connects to the new module, like you can see right here. And now that we've got
12:19:13
that data, we can fill out the system message a bit better, right? So the system message is like the information
12:19:19
that's not going to change each time and then the prompt is the information that's going to be dynamic and change
12:19:25
each time you get an application, right? Cuz obviously other people's. So what we can do here is we can say okay full name
12:19:31
equals email equals here's the details of the website. The more information you feed this AI agent, the more
12:19:38
personalized the email that gets sent afterwards is going to be sent as well. So, if we take this, we're like, okay,
12:19:44
there's the website, here's the email to fill in, here's the name, and we'll grab the information on how I can help you,
12:19:50
etc. You could take the monthly budget. I don't think that's going to be very important. And then also inside the system message, you want to add some
12:19:56
like details on how you want this written, right? So, for example, for me, it's okay, short, to the point, no
12:20:02
fluff, conversational, polite, friendly, good vibes, right? Just some information
12:20:09
on how we want this written. Now also you can see here how it says okay I need a little information to write personalized email could you tell me
12:20:15
this that's based that was before we plugged in all the personalized data right now that we've got the
12:20:20
personalized data inside this message between the text which is the prompt and
12:20:26
the system message which is basically how the AI agent is trained we can create something much better so let's
12:20:31
test this step out now and you can see this is much nicer right much nicer what we're also going to do here is inside
12:20:38
the system message and this is really to test out cuz you can see okay what do you like what don't you like so you see
12:20:43
here how it says best I'm going to say no email signature/b best etc I'm also
12:20:49
going to say go easy on the exclamation marks use them sparingly thing as well
12:20:55
like for email deliverability if we just smash in loads of exclamation marks like here and here that's not good right and
12:21:02
then I'll say make it very personal plus explain you're working on analyzing
12:21:07
their website ASAP All right. Then we can show we're more prepared in the email. Let's test it
12:21:12
again. See what we get back. And we've got the information right there, which is perfect. Now, what we can also do is just reconfirm the actual time that it
12:21:19
was booked for. So, we can grab the time zone like so. Now, inside here as well, inside AI agent, if you don't want to
12:21:25
use Google Gemini's model directly, you can actually delete that. And then you can add here open rout. And using open
12:21:32
router a new account here we can go through the list and we can say okay Google we'll just go with for example
12:21:38
like Google flash light preview using our open router account again you can get a free account at openrooout.ai and
12:21:44
if you type in Google gemini flash 2.0 O light previewed. You can get access right here. And by the way, if you don't
12:21:51
want to set this all up yourself, this whole AI agent workflow, then I'll leave the SAP inside the AI profit boardroom.
12:21:58
So you can get access to that link in the comments description. But essentially, if you just go to open router keys, get an API key, you can add
12:22:06
that to an open router chat module, and then select Google Gemini 2.0 flashlight
12:22:12
preview right there. All right. And then we've got the input over here. So this is the data that's been fed into the
12:22:17
system and then this is the output. Right? Great to meet you. Just wanted to quickly check in and see if you're still
12:22:23
planning on attending our call. I'm already digging into your website and I'm excited to share my initial thoughts. What we can also do to make
12:22:29
this even better is we could say, "Okay, Goldie agency is an SEO link building
12:22:35
agency and this is an appointment about getting more leads, traffic, and sales
12:22:43
with SEO. It's a custom SEO game plan. By the way, if you want to book this in,
12:22:49
feel free to book a free SEO strategy session. Link in the comments description. So, we're just going to test this out now. And there you go.
12:22:55
Hey, Julian. Just wanted to quickly confirm we're still good to go for our call to discuss how you can get more least traffic sales with SEO. I'm
12:23:00
already digging into your website to get a game plan ready for you. Let me know if that time still works. See you then.
12:23:06
Nice. It's easy. And what you can also do is inside here inside the Google calendar section, you can set up a new
12:23:11
appointment and that can pull in the information from Google calendar. So that's the other beautiful thing about
12:23:17
this AI agent workflow. Not only can you link this to open router, not only can you filter the data to go to the right
12:23:23
sales rep, but you can also have a look at the calendar, pull in the latest details of that session. And then
12:23:29
finally, what we're going to do here inside the email module is we're going to select Gmail. We'll type in draft.
12:23:35
get it. So, we'll say create a draft email. You don't want to set I think unless you're super super confident in
12:23:41
this, like you probably don't want to just fire this off like a a maniac, but
12:23:46
you can pull in the draft and then plug it into the message section over here. Now, just before we do that, what we
12:23:52
also want is we want a subject line, right? We want a subject line for this email. And so, what we can do over here
12:23:58
is we can add a new AI agent. We can plug in the email that was drafted from the AI agent over here. And we can say
12:24:05
create a subject line for this email. And then we're just going to add open router. Again, open routters API
12:24:12
actually for this whole workflow seems to be a lot more reliable than using Google's directly. Just something to
12:24:18
bear in mind there from what I've tested so far in this workflow today. We're now going to rename these agents just so it's super easy for us to understand it.
12:24:25
You can always like drag and drop as well these modules just so that it's easier to to figure out, okay, what's
12:24:30
going on. I'm also going to delete this just to keep it simple for now. But you would create a branch off for every
12:24:35
single member of your team. Inside the AI agent module over here, we'll rename this email body agent. And then inside
12:24:42
this AI agent, we're going to rename this as email subject line agent. All
12:24:48
right. And there we go. Also, inside the calendar section over here, we're going to change this. We're going to say just
12:24:54
get an event, right? And if we select get many, it can retrieve all the latest
12:24:59
appointments inside this calendar. Right? So, we've connected Google calendar, we said get all the latest
12:25:05
appointments from the calendar and boom, there we go. All right. Now, what you can see from here inside the subject
12:25:11
line agent is it's drafted loads. And obviously, if you send that directly to Gmail, that's going to be a total mess,
12:25:17
right? You don't want five headlines and your sales rep is just going to get annoyed with you. So, we're going to hit test step now. And I've changed it. It
12:25:23
says only give me one subject line. Make it relevant to the email above. Make it very personalized and short. And it said
12:25:29
SEO strategy call confirmation. Julian. You could also say, okay, include their website in the email, too. We'll test
12:25:36
that right now. Boom. Look at that. Julian SEO call confirmation and preparation for their website. So, this
12:25:42
is personalized. And also, the subject line is relevant to the appointment name. All right. Now, inside the Gmail
12:25:47
section, we're going to draft an email, create it. We're going to take the subject line from the previous subject
12:25:53
line agent. Nice and easy. And then inside the message text here, we're going to delete that. I'm just going to
12:25:59
take the output from the email body agent. Okay, if we test that out, what
12:26:04
you also want to make sure when you're doing this is inside the create new credential section, you actually have
12:26:09
this link to the relevant inbox, right? So, if you just click on create new credential, we can sign in with Google
12:26:14
and connect our inbox. And then once you've done that as well, you just want to rename it cuz otherwise it's going to get super confusing if you have Gmail
12:26:21
one, Gmail 2, etc. So, instead, we're going to name that as a person that it's related to. There we go. And now we can
12:26:28
actually just test the steps. So let's test what happens. And if we go over to our drafts over here, you can see that
12:26:34
it's got information on the name, the website, the email is nicely formatted.
12:26:39
We can also add a two email. So the email address of the person that we're having the call with. There we go. Let's test it out. And look at that.
12:26:46
Beautiful. We got the email address of the person we're emailing, the details in the subject line, and the details of
12:26:53
the email inbox. Now, if you want to make this live, you would just click on active over here. And that's ready to go. And that was incredibly easy and
12:27:00
simple to do. And we've just automated email follow-ups for our team. And if you have a sales team, the sales people
12:27:06
don't like happening, right? They like jumping on the calls. We want to automate as much of this as we can.
12:27:12
Number one, so we can communicate better with the sales prospect. Number two, so we're super organized because this will
12:27:17
draft it. And number three, so we can save our sales rep time and they get better results. We get better results. Everyone's happy. Right? And then you'd
12:27:23
go back to go high level. Make sure that's saved and ready to go. And this workflow is just running beautifully
12:27:29
now. And the craziest thing about this is like the API from open router using Google is free as well. So it's not
12:27:36
going to cost you anything. This is all automated. And imagine how much time your sales team would take writing the
12:27:42
emails, quality controlling, and making sure they actually send the emails. Even if that's only say 30 minutes a day to
12:27:48
five different prospects, five different sales calls a day, then that's a 100 minutes a week, which is 400 minutes a
12:27:54
month on something that you can easily automate, right? You save yourself nearly 7 hours a month just by setting
12:27:59
up a workflow in 20 minutes. And let's be honest, there's no grammar mistakes. The emails don't get forgotten about.
12:28:06
Every lead and prospect gets followed up with properly, and it's just a beautiful workflow. You can also, for example, set
12:28:13
up an email feedback loop, right? So if we go over here, you can have a human in
12:28:18
the loop and it can actually draft the email, send it to you for approval. You give that feedback that gets sent back
12:28:24
to the AI agent and then you create this beautiful it selfiterating process where
12:28:29
the AI agent just gets better and better every time. If you want to see that and you want to see more stuff like that, feel free to ask me on the weekly calls
12:28:35
inside the AI profit boardroom or just comment below on this video and I'll try and get something sorted out for you.
12:28:41
So, what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to take this workflow right here for NA10 sales agents and I'll plug that
12:28:48
inside the AI profit boardroom. We'll add that section right here and we'll call that NA10 sales agents. All right.
12:28:56
And then I'll upload the JSON file that you can import into NA10. So, that's a workflow template and you just
12:29:02
personalize it to you and your business. The other thing that you could do as well is you could also send automated
12:29:08
texts. So you can create a personalized text to the prospect as soon as they book in using Twilio. And you can even
12:29:15
use WhatsApp as well. So you can connect this to WhatsApp as well. So pretty amazing what you can do. So much cool
12:29:21
stuff in there. This workflow is going to be super useful for us anyway. And you can grab all the template plus my
12:29:26
best SPS plus an AI crash course and get weekly calls directly with me inside the
12:29:33
AI profit boardroom link in the comments description. And if you want to get a free one-to-one SEO strategy session

Most people are using Gemini like it's
0:01
just another chatbot. They type a
0:03
question, get an answer, and move on.
0:04
But what they don't realize is that
0:06
buried inside Gemini are features that
0:08
can automate your research, generate
0:09
studio quality audio, analyze entire
0:12
video libraries, and even build custom
0:14
tools that save you hours every single
0:15
week. Gemini 3.0 Pro is Google's most
0:18
intelligent AI model right now. And it's
0:20
built completely different from what
0:21
you're used to. It's multimodal, which
0:23
means it doesn't just understand text.
0:24
It can process images, videos, audio,
0:27
PDFs, and even entire code bases all at
0:29
once. It scores higher than GPT5 and
0:31
clawed on most benchmarks. And it has a
0:33
massive context window of up to 2
0:35
million tokens, which basically means
0:37
you can feed it 1500 pages of
0:39
information, and it'll remember every
0:41
detail. I've spent the last month
0:42
testing every part of Gemini 3.0 Pro,
0:44
and I found capabilities that most users
0:46
will never discover because Google
0:48
barely talks about them. While everyone
0:49
else is stuck with basic prompts, I'm
0:51
going to show you exactly how to unlock
0:53
the full power of this tool so you can
0:54
work faster, smarter, and way more
0:56
efficiently than almost everyone else
0:58
using it. By the way, if you want to
0:59
follow along, Gemini is free to start
1:00
with, and I'll show you which features
1:02
work on the free plan and which ones
1:03
need the paid version. Either way,
1:05
you're about to learn things that'll
1:06
completely change how you use AI. Let's
1:08
start with the basics most people skip,
1:10
and that's understanding what Gemini 3.0
1:12
Pro actually is. This model launched a
1:14
few weeks ago, and it's a massive
1:15
upgrade from the previous version. It's
1:17
built for complex reasoning, which means
1:19
it can handle multi-step problems, plan
1:21
out workflows, and execute tasks
1:23
autonomously. And when I say
1:24
autonomously, I mean that you can give
1:26
it a goal, and it'll break that goal
1:28
into steps, use the right tools, and get
1:30
it done without you having to
1:31
micromanage every little detail. Gemini
1:33
3.0 Pro has different thinking levels.
1:35
You can set it to fast for quick answers
1:38
or thinking when you need it to really
1:39
analyze something deeply. The thinking
1:41
mode takes a few extra seconds, but the
1:43
quality of the output is noticeably
1:44
better because it's actually planning
1:46
its response before it generates
1:47
anything. Let me show you what that
1:48
looks like in action. I'm going to open
1:50
Gemini right now and run a test. First,
1:52
I'll click on the model picker and
1:54
select thinking. This gives me access to
1:55
Gemini 3.0 Pro's advanced reasoning
1:57
mode. I'll give it a complex problem,
1:59
something like I'm launching a new
2:01
productivity app. I have three marketing
2:03
strategies to choose from. Strategy A
2:05
costs $10,000 and targets social media
2:07
ads. Strategy B costs 5,000 and focuses
2:10
on SEO and content marketing. Strategy C
2:13
costs 15,000 and uses influencer
2:15
partnerships. Which one should I pick
2:17
and why? Watch what happens. Gemini
2:19
doesn't just spit out a generic answer.
2:21
It's breaking down the problem,
2:22
calculating potential ROI for each
2:24
strategy, comparing the long-term value
2:26
versus the upfront cost, and then
2:28
ranking the options based on actual
2:30
logic. This is the high thinking level
2:32
at work. It's not guessing. It's
2:34
reasoning through the problem step by
2:36
step. The result it gives me isn't just
2:38
pick strategy B because it's cheaper.
2:40
It's showing me the math, explaining why
2:42
content marketing has a longer payoff
2:43
curve, and telling me which strategy
2:45
makes the most sense based on my
2:47
specific situation. That's the kind of
2:48
output you get when you use Gemini the
2:50
right way. One of the most underrated
2:52
features is the fact that it's
2:53
multimodal, like I mentioned. For
2:54
example, Gemini can analyze images with
2:56
insane precision. It can read text
2:59
inside images, understand layouts,
3:01
extract data from charts, and even
3:03
interpret handwriting. I have a receipt
3:05
from a restaurant. It's crumpled,
3:06
slightly blurry, and taken with my
3:08
phone. I'll upload it to Gemini and ask
3:10
it to extract all the information. I'll
3:12
type, pull out the merchant name, date,
3:15
items purchased, prices, and total
3:17
formatted as a table. Just like that,
3:19
Gemini reads every line, even the small
3:21
print at the bottom, and organizes it
3:23
into a clean, structured table. Merchant
3:26
name, date, items, prices, totals,
3:29
everything is accurate. This works for
3:31
invoices, business cards, contracts,
3:33
forms, anything with text. You're
3:35
basically turning your phone camera into
3:36
a data extraction tool. I can upload a
3:38
screenshot of a website homepage and ask
3:40
for design feedback. I'll say, "Analyze
3:42
this layout, and tell me what's working
3:44
and what's not." Gemini looks at the
3:45
visual layout, notices the navigation
3:47
text, heavy intro, repetitive social
3:49
media sharing, and weird image
3:50
placement. This is design feedback that
3:52
you'd get from a professional website
3:54
designer, not just generic text. And
3:56
when it comes to images, it doesn't just
3:57
analyze them, but it can generate them.
3:59
and it's really good at it. The model it
4:00
uses is called Nano Banana Pro and it's
4:03
built by Google specifically for
4:04
creating highquality visuals. I'll type
4:06
generate a realistic image of a modern
4:08
home office setup with a standing desk,
4:10
dual monitors, and natural lighting.
4:12
Just like that, Gemini creates a clean,
4:14
professional image that looks like it
4:16
could be a stock photo. You can use this
4:17
for blog content, social media posts,
4:19
presentations, anywhere you need visuals
4:21
without hunting for stock images or
4:23
hiring a designer. If you want to refine
4:25
it, you can. I'll say make the lighting
4:27
warmer. Gemini adjusts the image
4:29
instantly. This kind of control is rare
4:30
in AI image generators, and it's built
4:32
right into Gemini. On the free plan, you
4:34
get two image generations per day. And
4:36
if you want to animate those images, the
4:38
video generation is on the paid plan,
4:39
but we'll take a look at that later.
4:41
Gemini also has a feature called deep
4:43
research, and that isn't a search
4:44
engine. It's an autonomous research
4:46
agent. You give it a research question,
4:48
and instead of just pulling up a few
4:49
links, Gemini goes out, reads dozens of
4:51
sources, brings together all the
4:53
findings, and writes you a full
4:54
multi-page report with citations. This
4:56
is extremely useful for students or
4:58
people who do research. And it saves you
4:59
so much time from looking through every
5:01
single source out there just to find one
5:03
that fits your project. Let me show you.
5:04
I'll type research the five most
5:06
discussed AI breakthroughs from the last
5:08
90 days. Focus on practical applications
5:11
for marketers. Include source links.
5:13
Gemini takes a few minutes, scans the
5:15
web, reads papers, blog posts, and news
5:17
articles, and then comes back with a
5:19
structured report. I get seven deep
5:20
insights, each one backed by multiple
5:22
sources, and every claim is linked so I
5:24
can verify it myself. This is the kind
5:27
of research that would normally take me
5:28
hours, and Gemini just did it in
5:30
minutes. On the free plan, you get five
5:32
deep research reports per month. On the
5:34
paid plan, it's unlimited. If you're a
5:36
student, a researcher, or anyone who
5:37
needs to gather information fast, this
5:39
feature alone makes the subscription
5:41
worth it. Another key feature is that
5:42
Gemini can analyze videos. You can
5:45
upload a video file or paste a YouTube
5:47
link and Gemini will watch the entire
5:48
thing, break it down, and give you
5:50
insights. Let's say I found a
5:52
competitor's product demo on YouTube.
5:54
It's 30 minutes long and I don't have
5:55
time to watch the whole thing. I'll
5:57
paste the link into Gemini and say,
5:59
"Watch this demo and extract every
6:00
feature mentioned, organize them by
6:02
category, include timestamps." Gemini
6:05
processes the entire video, categorizes
6:07
the features into sections like
6:09
automation, reporting, and integrations,
6:11
and gives me a structured breakdown with
6:13
exact timestamps. No manual searching or
6:15
transcript hunting. This is perfect for
6:17
competitive analysis, learning from
6:18
tutorials, or summarizing webinars you
6:21
don't have time to sit through. Another
6:22
thing to note is that Gemini's workspace
6:24
integration will save you hours every
6:26
week. If you enable Workspace
6:28
extensions, Gemini can connect directly
6:30
to your Gmail, Google Calendar, and
6:31
Google Drive. This works on the free
6:34
plan, and if you bill by the hour, this
6:35
feature pays for itself by saving you so
6:37
much time every morning. Now, like I
6:38
mentioned in the beginning of the video,
6:40
Gemini 3.0 Pro has a 2 million token
6:43
context window, which is about 1500
6:45
pages of text in a single conversation.
6:47
That basically means you can upload any
6:49
form of text that's way longer than any
6:50
other model can handle, and Gemini will
6:52
remember all of it. I'll upload 10
6:54
meeting notes from the first quarter and
6:55
say, "Find every mention of budget
6:57
concerns, list them by date, and
6:59
summarize the main issues." Gemini scans
7:01
everything, pulls the mentions, and
7:03
gives me a structured summary. This is
7:05
game-changing for lawyers, researchers,
7:07
consultants, anyone drowning in
7:08
documents. Another useful tool is
7:10
Gemini's narration feature. If you go
7:12
into Google AI Studio, you can turn text
7:14
into highquality narration. I'll write a
7:16
training script, maybe a guide on
7:17
keyword research. Then I'll go to AI
7:19
Studio, select audio, pick single
7:22
speaker, and paste the script. In
7:24
seconds, I have professional narration.
7:26
Welcome to this quick guide on keyword
7:28
research. Today we'll cover the basic
7:31
steps to find the right keywords for
7:34
your website or blog.
7:35
The voice sounds natural, way better
7:37
than most texttospech tools. Another
7:39
example is content generation. The user
7:41
enters a topic, Gemini searches for
7:43
trending articles on that topic,
7:45
summarizes them, and formats everything
7:47
as a newsletter. It searches, finds
7:49
recent articles, writes summaries, and
7:52
compiles it into newsletter format. This
7:54
whole process takes less than a minute.
7:56
In Gemini, you also have access to VO3,
7:59
which if you haven't heard, is Google's
8:00
newest video generation tool. With this,
8:02
you can animate a static image. Like I
8:04
briefly said above, let me show you how
8:06
this works. Upload a product photo and
8:08
type animate this as a looping video for
8:11
a website. Subtle movement. Camera
8:13
slowly zooms in. Lighting shifts
8:15
slightly. Smooth 8second loop. V3
8:18
processes it. And in a couple of
8:20
minutes, you have a cinematic looping
8:21
video.
8:25
[Music]
8:29
The quality is insane and V3 itself is
8:31
one of, if not the best video generation
8:33
tools right now. You can use it for
8:35
website headers, social ads,
8:36
presentation intros, and honestly
8:38
anything you can think of. And the crazy
8:40
part is most people that use Gemini
8:41
don't even know they have access to
8:43
this. So now you know how to use Gemini
8:44
3.0 Pro better than most people. And
8:46
with Gemini, you can automate research,
8:48
analyze data, generate content, and
8:50
build workflows that save you hours
8:52
every week. If you enjoyed this tutorial
8:54

on humanity's last exam without tools.
1:26
91.9%
1:27
on GPQA Diamond and 72.7%
1:31
on Screen Spot Pro, which tests how well
1:34
it understands UI elements on a screen.
1:37
It outperforms GBT 5.1, Clawson Sonnet
1:40
4.5, and its predecessor, Gemini 2.5 Pro
1:44
across the board. All right, let me show
Live Demo: Complex Reasoning Test
1:46
you how this actually works. I'm going
1:47
to open the Gemini app right now, and
1:50
we're going to run a few tests. I want
1:51
to show you the difference between low
1:53
thinking level and high thinking level
1:55
and then we'll test the multimodal
1:57
capabilities. Here I am in the Gemini
1:59
app. I've selected thinking from the
2:01
model picker. This gives me access to
2:03
Gemini 3.0 Pro. Let's start with a
2:06
simple test. While I'm testing Gemini 3
2:09
Pro here, I'm using AI Master Pro in
2:12
another tab. It's where I keep my
2:14
prompts organized and track what
2:16
actually works. But here's the key. We
2:18
built an AI agent inside called Ask AI
2:21
Master that's trained on our knowledge
2:24
base and can teach you right now about
2:26
Gemini, VO, Nano Banana Pro, and
2:29
anything AI related. Plus, we've got PDF
2:32
guides for Gemini, and we're working in
2:34
full courses for VO and Nano Banana. Oh,
2:37
and we're integrating these video and
2:40
image generation tools directly into the
2:42
platform. So, join now for early access
2:45
and bonus generation credits. links
2:47
below. Now, let's keep going. I'm going
2:49
to give it a complex reasoning problem.
2:51
Here's my test prompt. Okay, I've
2:53
submitted the prompt. Watch how Gemini
2:55
3.0 Pro thinks through this. It's
2:58
breaking down the problem, calculating
3:00
metrics, and building a strategic
3:02
recommendation. Look at this. It's not
3:03
just giving me a generic answer. It's
3:06
calculating the impact of each strategy,
3:08
comparing the numbers, and ranking the
3:10
options based on ROI. This is the
3:12
highing level in action. The model spent
3:15
a few extra seconds planning its
3:17
response before generating output. And
3:19
the result is way more structured and
Multimodal Understanding (Video, Images etc..)
3:21
actionable. Now, let's test the
3:22
multimodal capabilities. I'm going to
3:24
upload an image, a screenshot of a
3:26
complex data dashboard, and ask Gemini
3:29
to analyze it. Here's my prompt. Nice.
3:31
It's not just reading the image. It's
3:33
actually interpreting the data, spotting
3:35
patterns, calling out anomalies, and
3:37
suggesting next steps. This is the
3:39
moment you realize multimodal models
3:41
aren't a nice extra. They're basically a
3:44
full-blown analyst who can look at a
3:45
dashboard and tell you what matters
3:47
before you've even zoomed in. And that's
3:49
when it clicks. We're moving from
3:51
manually asking AI to analyze data to
3:54
simply showing at the world and letting
3:56
it draw conclusions on its own. So, the
3:58
chapter ends right where Gemini's
4:00
analysis does with the realization that
4:02
multimodality isn't the future of
4:05
analytics. It's the new baseline. if it
Video Analysis Features
4:07
can break down a static dashboard. What
4:09
happens when we throw something more
4:10
chaotic at it, like a full video? Let's
4:13
also test its video analysis features.
4:15
In the next example, I'll upload a video
4:18
and ask Gemini to break it into
4:19
chapters, highlight the key moments,
4:22
identify emotional peaks, and suggest
4:24
how to tighten the story. The goal here
4:26
is simple. Can a multimodal model act
4:29
like a real editor, not just a
4:31
transcription machine? And boom, it does
4:33
the whole thing. Clean structure, clear
4:35
insights, even notes on pacing. At this
4:38
point, it's not AI helping with editing.
4:40
It's a junior editor. Final test, long
Long-Context Test (30-page PDF)
4:43
context understanding. I'm going to
4:44
upload a 30page PDF, a research report,
4:47
and ask Gemini to summarize it and
4:49
answer specific questions. My prompt is
4:52
that simple. Perfect. It read the entire
4:55
30page document, pulled out the key
4:57
findings, identified the methodology,
4:59
and flagged the limitations section.
5:01
This is the 1 million token context
5:03
window at work. No chunking, no errors,
5:06
just accurate, comprehensive analysis.
AI Mode in Google Search (Education & Visualization)
5:08
Now, let's test the new extended AI mode
5:11
in Google search. This is Gemini 3.0 Pro
5:15
powering Google search directly, giving
5:16
you deeper, more contextaware answers.
5:19
I've enabled AI mode with extended
5:21
thinking in Google search. Watch the
5:23
difference. Here's my search query. How
5:25
to improve YouTube CTR for tech
5:27
tutorial. Look at this. It's not just
5:29
giving me a list of links. It's
5:31
generating the full layout with
5:32
actionable tips, thumbnail examples,
5:35
title formulas, and even CTR benchmarks
5:37
for tech channels. It's pulling data
5:39
from multiple sources, synthesizing it,
5:41
and presenting it in a clean visual
5:44
format. This is what AI powered search
5:46
should look like. Now, let's try
5:47
something more complex. Search query.
5:49
How does quantum entanglement work?
5:51
Incredible. It's not just text. It's
5:53
generating visual diagrams showing
5:55
particle states, spin correlations, and
5:57
even an analogy comparing entanglement
5:59
to synchronized coins. This is AI
6:01
powered learning. It's taking a dense
6:03
physics concept and making it visual and
6:05
accessible. Let's push it further.
6:07
Search query. Visualize how compound
6:09
interest grows over 20 years with
6:11
$10,000 at 7% annual return. Perfect. It
6:15
generated a full chart with a growth
6:16
curve year-by-year breakdown and
6:18
calculated the final return $ 38,697.
6:24
This is where AI mode becomes a learning
6:25
tool. It's not just finding information.
6:27
and it's visualizing and explaining
6:30
principles. All right, now let me show
6:31
you how I'm organizing all of this in
6:33
real time because here's the thing,
6:34
Gemini 3 Pro, VO, Nano Banana, these are
6:37
powerful tools, but when you're testing
6:39
multiple models and building actual
6:41
workflows, you need a hub to keep it all
6:44
together. This is AI Master Pro. It's
6:46
the all-in-one platform I built and use
6:49
every day. Let me show you what's
6:51
inside. First, we've got courses. The AI
6:54
master method covers AI foundations and
6:56
workflows. Plus, we're building
6:58
dedicated courses for VO and Nano Banana
7:01
right now. But here's the key. We built
7:03
an AI agent called Ask AI Master that's
7:06
trained on our knowledge base and can
7:08
teach you Gemini, VO, Nano Banana,
7:11
everything we're covering today. You can
7:13
ask it anything 24/7 while you're
7:16
learning. We also have Prompt Lab Pro
7:19
with 300 plus readyto-use prompts,
7:21
prompt creator, text to speech, all
7:23
built in. So, you're not just learning
7:25
AI, you're using AI while you learn. And
7:29
like I mentioned earlier, we're
7:30
integrating VO and Nano Banana directly
7:33
into the platform. Right now, we're
7:35
given 24% off annual subscriptions for
7:38
the first 1,000 members. If you've been
7:40
thinking, I need to figure this AI thing
7:43
out, this is the easiest way to start.
7:46
links in the description. Okay, so we've
Gemini 3.0 Pro Interactive Learning Tools
7:48
seen AI mode in search, but here's where
7:50
Gemini 3 Pro becomes seriously powerful
7:53
for education. You can ask it to create
7:56
custom learning materials, visualize
7:57
complex concepts, and even build
8:00
interactive tools to explore scientific
8:02
principles. This isn't just about
8:03
reading explanations. It's about
8:05
creating visual interactive learning
8:07
experiences on demand. Let me show you.
8:09
I'm going to ask Gemini to create a
8:10
visual explanation of a physics concept,
8:13
specifically projectile motion. I'll try
8:15
this prompt. Look at this. It's showing
8:17
the parabolic trajectory, breaking down
8:20
the velocity into horizontal, constant,
8:22
and vertical affected by gravity
8:24
components, and walking through the math
8:26
step by step. It even generated a simple
8:29
diagram showing the launch angle, peak
8:31
height, and landing point. Now, let's
8:33
take it further. I'm going to ask Gemini
8:34
to write code that simulates this.
8:36
Coding a physics simulation. Here's the
8:38
next prompt. Perfect. It wrote a
8:41
complete Python script with user inputs,
8:43
physics calculations, and a matt plot
8:45
lib visualization. The script calculates
8:47
max height, range, time of flight, and
8:50
plots the trajectory curve. This is
8:52
ready to run. I can copy paste this into
8:54
Jupyter Notebook or Google Collab and
8:56
test it immediately. This is live
8:58
physics education, visual, interactive,
9:01
and instant. Now, let's take this to the
9:02
next level. Instead of just generating
9:04
explanations or one-off simulations, I'm
9:06
going to ask Gemini to build a full
9:08
interactive educational app, something
9:10
you can use to explore concepts, tweak
9:12
parameters, and see results in real
9:14
time. I'm going to build a Lego style
9:16
physics constructor, an app where you
9:19
can design structures, apply forces, and
9:21
see how they behave under physics rules.
9:24
Here's my prompt for Python-based Lego
9:26
app. Incredible. It generated a complete
9:28
app. Let me walk through the code. Block
9:31
placement system. Click to place blocks
9:33
on a grid. Physics engine. Gravity pulls
9:35
blocks down. Friction slows sliding.
9:37
Collisions are detected. Force
9:39
application. Click and drag to apply
9:41
pushpull forces. Realtime visualization.
9:44
Pygame renders the blocks and shows
9:46
forces as vectors. The code is modular.
9:48
Separate functions for physics rendering
9:51
and user input. This is production
9:53
ready. And here it is running. I'm
9:55
placing blocks to build a tower. Now I
9:57
enable gravity. Watch the structure
9:59
collapse because the base isn't stable.
10:01
Let me rebuild with a wider base. Now I
10:04
apply a lateral force. Watch the blocks
10:06
slide and fall realistically. This is a
10:08
fully interactive physics playground
10:10
created in under 2 minutes with one
10:12
prompt. Let's do one more. I'm going to
10:14
ask Gemini to create an interactive
10:16
visualization for Ohm's law. Here is my
10:18
prompt. Perfect. The app has sliders for
10:21
voltage and resistance. Calculates
10:22
current automatically. displays a simple
10:24
circuit diagram and plots VI and R on a
10:28
live updating graph. Here it is. I'm
10:30
adjusting the voltage slider. Watch the
10:32
current value update instantly and the
10:34
graph redraw. Now I increase resistance.
10:36
Current drops proportionally. This is
10:38
active learning. You tweak inputs and
10:41
immediately see how the system responds.
10:43
This would take hours to build manually.
10:45
Gemini did it in seconds. Next up, voice
Voice Mode & Live Camera Mode
10:48
mode. This lets you have natural spoken
10:50
conversations with Gemini. No typing
10:52
required. It's built into the Gemini. I
10:55
usually use it on my phone. So, the
10:57
microphone icon. Hey Gemini, I need to
11:00
plan a YouTube video about AI automation
11:02
tools. Suggest five title options, a
11:05
hook that grabs attention the first 10
11:07
seconds, and a content structure for
11:10
15-minute video. And watch this. Gemini
11:12
is processing my voice input,
11:14
understanding the context, and
11:16
generating full video plan, titles,
11:19
hook, structure, everything. The
11:22
response is instant and it's
11:23
comprehensive. This is perfect for
11:25
brainstorming on the go when you don't
11:27
have time to type. Now, let's try live
11:30
mode. This is where things get wild.
11:32
Live mode lets Gemini see your screen or
11:34
use your camera in real time. It
11:37
responds instantly to what it sees. So,
11:39
I've enabled live mode and pointed my
11:41
phone's camera. I've drawn a rough
11:43
flowchart for an automation workflow.
11:46
Can you read this flowchart and tell me
11:47
if there are any logical errors or
11:50
missing steps? Okay, let's have a look
11:52
at this flowchart. It starts with
11:54
receive order, then enter in system,
11:57
followed by credit check. If the credit
11:59
check is okay, it moves on to check
12:01
inventory. If no, it goes to refuse
12:04
order.
12:05
Incredible. Gemini is reading my
12:07
handwriting, understanding the flowchart
12:10
structure, spotting the missing
12:11
conditional step, and suggesting where
12:13
to add error handling. This is real time
12:16
visual reasoning. You can use this for
12:18
debugging code on your screen, analyzing
12:21
physical documents, or even getting an
12:24
instant feedback on your notes. So,
12:26
that's where we are right now. Gemini
12:28
Live Mode is ahead in realistic
12:30
conversational AI, while Runway 4.5, VO
12:34
3.1, and Sora 2 are catching up fast in
12:37
AI video consistency. And the race is
12:40
nowhere near over. Honestly, the pace is
12:43
insane. Six months ago, none of these
12:45
tools were anywhere near this level.
12:47
Which brings up something real. If
12:49
you're not actively learning how AI
12:51
works, not just watching videos about
12:53
it, but actually using it, you're going
12:55
to wake up in 2026 and realize the gap
12:58
just got way bigger. AI was one of the
13:00
most in- demand skills of 2025,
13:03
according to the World Economic Forum.
13:05
Yet, most of us didn't learn it. And
13:06
that puts us at risk, not just of
13:08
falling behind, but of being replaced.
13:10
You still have 45 days to learn AI and
13:13
step into 2026 as a more skilled,
13:15
smarter, and employable individual. And
13:17
you can do it in just two days. Let me
13:19

Image Recognition & Analysis
15:02
blast. Let's talk about image
15:03
recognition. Gemini 3 Pro doesn't just
15:06
generate images. It can analyze them
15:08
with surgical precision. It can read
15:11
text and images, OCR, identify objects,
15:14
understand layouts, extract data from
15:16
charts, and even interpret handwriting.
15:19
I'm going to upload a photo of a receipt
15:21
crumpled, slightly blurry, taken with my
15:23
phone, and ask Gemini to extract all the
15:26
data. Prompt: Extract all the
15:28
information from this receipt. Merchant
15:30
name, date, items purchased, prices,
15:32
total, and payment method. Formatted as
15:34
a table. Perfect. It read every line,
15:37
even the small print at the bottom, and
15:39
formatted it into a clean structured
15:41
table. Merchant name, date, items,
15:44
prices, totals, everything is accurate.
15:46
This works for invoices, business cards,
15:48
contracts, forms, anything with text.
15:51
Now, let's test layout understanding.
15:53
I'm going to upload a screenshot of a
15:55
website homepage and ask Gemini to
15:57
critique the design with this prompt.
15:59
Look at this response. It's analyzing
16:01
the visual hierarchy, noticing that the
16:03
navigation menu is cluttered and
16:05
suggesting a clearer focal point above
16:08
the fold. This is design feedback from
16:10
an AI that actually understands layouts.
Gemini Agent Mode
16:13
Next up, agent mode. This is where
16:15
Gemini 3.0 Pro gets seriously powerful.
16:18
Agent mode allows Gemini to complete
16:21
multi-step tasks autonomously. You give
16:23
it a high-level goal like organize my
16:26
inbox or research and draft an email and
16:29
it breaks the task into steps, uses
16:31
tools, and executes the plan for you.
16:33
Agent mode is powered by Gemini 3.0 pros
16:37
advanced reasoning, live web browsing
16:39
and tool use. It integrates with Gmail,
16:42
Google Calendar, Canvas, Deep Research,
16:44
and more. All right, let's move to
Nano Banana Pro Image Generation
16:46
images. Nano Banana Pro is Google's most
16:49
advanced image generation and editing
16:51
model. It's built on Gemini 3.0 Pro, and
16:54
it's designed for professional-grade
16:56
image creation. Let's break down the key
16:58
features, and I'll show you a real
17:00
example for each one. Nano Banana Pro is
17:03
the best model for creating images with
17:05
legible, accurate text. Let me show you
17:07
text rendering in action. I'm going to
17:09
create a YouTube thumbnail with clear,
17:12
legible text. I'll use this prompt. Look
17:14
at that. The text is crystal clear. No
17:17
weird kerning, no distorted letters,
17:19
just clean, professional typography.
17:21
This is exactly what you need for
17:23
thumbnails, posters, or any design where
17:26
text readability is critical. This is
17:28
unique. Nano Banana Pro can connect to
17:30
Google search to verify facts in real
17:32
time. Prompted to generate an
17:34
infographic showing current weather in
17:36
Tokyo with accurate temperature and
17:38
conditions, it will pull live weather
17:40
data from Google search and generate an
17:42
image with the correct numbers. Now,
17:44
let's test the advanced editing
17:46
controls. I'm going to start with a
17:48
bright, sunny image and transform it
17:50
into a moody cinematic night scene. For
17:52
this scene, I'll use this prompt. Wow,
17:54
the entire vibe changed. The lighting is
17:57
now moody and atmospheric. There are
17:59
neon reflections on the wet street and
18:01
the color grade is cinematic. This would
18:03
take hours in Photoshop. Nano Banana Pro
18:06
did it in seconds. You can also upload
18:08
up to 14 reference images. Nano Banana
18:11
Pro will blend them seamlessly. Example:
18:13
Upload a character portrait, a landscape
18:16
background, and a lightening reference.
18:18
Prompt: Combine these three images into
18:20
one cohesive scene with the characters
18:22
standing in the landscape using the
18:24
light and style from the third image.
18:26
Perfect character consistency, seamless
18:28
blending. Finally, let's test
18:30
multi-image fusion. I'm going to create
18:32
a cohesive advertisement by blending
18:34
three images. A product shot, a logo,
18:37
and a style reference. This is my
18:39
prompt. Perfect. The product is
18:41
prominently displayed. The logo is
18:43
integrated naturally. The aesthetic
18:45
matches the style reference, and the
18:46
tagline is sharp and legible. This is
18:49
studio quality brand work generated in
18:51
under 10 seconds. The last feature for
18:53
this images generated in 1K, 2K or 4K
18:57
resolution. You can create a product
18:59
mockup at 4K resolution for print
19:01
materials. The output will be crisp,
19:03
high detail, and ready for large format
Veo 3.1 Video Generation
19:06
printing. Next, video generation. VO 3.1
19:09
is Google's state-of-the-art video
19:12
generation model. It creates
19:13
highfidelity 8-second videos at 720p or
19:17
1080p resolution with native audio
19:20
generation, meaning the sound is
19:22
synchronized automatically. Here are the
19:24
core features. Native audio generation,
19:26
VO 3.1 generates synchronized audio
19:29
automatically. Natural conversation,
19:31
sound effects, ambient noise, all
19:34
builtin. Now, let's test the native
19:36
audio generation. This is where VO 3.1
19:39
really shines. Here is my prompt. Listen
19:41
to this. And then he just stood up and
19:43
walked right out, leaving everyone
19:45
completely speechless. It was the
19:47
craziest thing I've ever seen.
19:48
Oh my god.
19:49
You can hear the conversation. The
19:51
voices are natural and synced perfectly
19:53
with the lip movements. But pay
19:55
attention to the background. There's the
19:57
hiss of the espresso machine. Quiet
19:59
chatter from other customers, footsteps,
20:02
even the clank of cups. All of this was
20:04
generated automatically. No foley work,
20:06
no audio mixing. VO 3.1 created the
20:10
entire soundsscape. image to video.
20:12
Upload a static image and VO will
20:14
animate it. This is perfect for turning
20:16
Nano Banana Pro images into dynamic
20:18
video clips. Here's where it gets
20:20
powerful. I'm going to take an image I
20:22
just created with Nano Banana Pro and
20:24
animated with VO 3.1. My prompt is
20:27
simple. Incredible. The product is
20:29
rotating smoothly. The neon lights are
20:32
pulsing and the camera is zooming in
20:35
exactly as prompted. The background
20:37
music is upbeat and matches the vibe.
20:43
This is a full video ad created from a
20:45
single image in under three minutes.
20:49
Let me show you. I'm going to create two
20:51
images with Nano Banana Pro. One showing
20:54
a person standing on a cliff at sunrise
20:56
and another showing the same person with
20:58
their arms raised as the sun fully
21:00
rises. Perfect. I have my two key
21:02
frames. Now I'm going to upload them to
21:04
VO 3.1 and ask it to create the
21:06
transition. I use this prompt.
21:08
Incredible. The transition is seamless.
21:11
The person's movement from standing
21:12
still to raising their arms is natural
21:15
and fluid. And you can see the hair and
21:17
clothes moving in the breeze. This is
21:19
cinema quality motion created by
21:21
defining just two frames. Scene
21:23
extension. Extend your videos by
21:25
chaining clips together. Now let's
21:26
extend the video to create a longer
21:28
narrative. I type my prompt. The camera
21:31
pulls back to reveal the full product
21:33
lineup. Text overlay appears at the
21:35
bottom. Available now. Fade to brand
21:37
logo. Perfect. The new clip connects
21:40
seamlessly. Camera pulls back. The text
21:42
overlay appears and it fades to the
21:43
logo. This is how you build full video
21:46
campaigns with VO 3.1. One extension at
21:49
a time. Finally, let's test reference
21:51
images. This is critical for maintaining
21:53
visual continuity across multiple
21:55
scenes. You upload up to three reference
21:58
images like a character design, a
22:00
location, or a style guide. And VO3 uses
22:03
them to keep everything consistent. I'm
22:05
going to create a short narrative with
22:06
three scenes all featuring the same
22:08
character in different locations. Here's
22:10
my prompt for this. Perfect. The
22:12
character matches the reference portrait
22:14
exactly. Same face, same clothing. The
22:17
urban street has the neon lit, gritty
22:19
aesthetic from the location reference,
22:22
and the lighting is moody and cinematic
22:24
just like the reference image. Now,
22:26
let's generate scene two. Keeping the
22:28
same character, but changing the
22:29
location. My prompt here, look at that.
22:31
The character is perfectly consistent.
22:33
Same face, same clothing. The apartment
22:36
has the moody cinematic lighting from
22:38
the reference and the rain on the
22:39
window, the thunder, the footsteps. All
22:42
the audio is synchronized beautifully.
22:49
This is the power of reference images.
22:51
You can create multi-seen narratives
22:53
with full visual and character
22:55
continuity without manually drawing or
22:58
filming anything. Just define your
23:00
references and VO3.1 handles the rest.

23:06
powered research and study tool. You
23:08
upload documents, PDFs, articles, or
23:10
notes, and Notebook LM helps you
23:12
understand, summarize, and explore the
23:15
material, even generate a podcast style

23:29
going to click generate audio overview.
23:32
All right, it's generating. Notebook LM
23:34
is reading the entire paper, identifying
23:36
the main arguments, and creating a
23:38
conversational podcast between two AI
23:40
hosts. One asking questions, the other
23:42
explaining concepts. Listen to this.
23:44
This report, it paints a wildly complex
23:46
picture. It's defined by these massive,
23:49
almost absurd tensions,
23:50
right? It's a tugof-war.
23:51
A tugof-war between
23:52
the two hosts are breaking down complex
23:55
AI alignment concepts in plain language,
23:57

24:13
It's studying reimagined. All right,
Complete Workflow Example
24:15
we've covered each tool individually.
24:17
Now, let's connect the dots. The real
24:19
power of Google's AI stack is how these
24:21
tools work together. There's a practical
24:23
workflow that uses Gemini 3, Nano Banana
24:26
Pro, and VO 3.1 all in one project.
24:29
scenario. You need to create a social
24:31

Introduction
0:11
My name is Trish Connor Cato. This course is recommended for users who want to get a quick overview
0:18
of Google Workspace applications. This class is especially appropriate for individuals moving to Google
0:25
Workspace from Microsoft Office. We'll start by focusing on Google Drive in Module 1.
0:33
Google Drive is the file storage application of the Workspace apps.
0:39
You'll learn about the display screen, how to change drive options, and even how to create a file from drive.
0:48
We'll move on to making a copy of a file and moving a file to trash before
0:53
we upload a file from a hard drive. You'll learn how to create and manage folders, as well as how to
0:59
upload a folder from a hard drive. We'll move on to learning how to search for files and how to add shortcuts
1:08
to Drive for efficiency purposes. We'll cover how to work with Drive priority and workspaces.
1:16
And this feature is only available for a business workspace account,
1:21
but if you don't have a business workspace account, you can still view the feature in the video.
1:28
And you'll also learn how to change Google Drive settings. We'll end the module by learning how to sign into multiple
1:35
Google accounts for easy access. We continue with learning Google Drive in Module 2, where you'll
1:44
learn how to collaborate in Drive. You'll learn how to share a file or folder, and we'll end the
1:50
module by publishing to the web. The third module focuses on common features.
1:58
It highlights features common to most of the Google Workspace apps.
2:03
You'll learn how to open a Google app before creating a new file. You'll get an overview of the menu and toolbar and how to use them.
2:12
You'll also learn how to access help. how to rename a file and how to email a file.
2:20
We'll move on to how to download files in other formats and we'll end this
2:26
module after learning how to open a Microsoft Office file in a Google app and how to work with versions.
2:34
We'll dive into Google Sheets, the Google Workspace spreadsheet application.
2:40
You'll learn about its display screen and how to input data along with some cool shortcuts.
2:48
We'll move on to creating formulas. working with functions, and using the Google Sheets functions list.
2:56
Then we will format numbers and learn how to preview and print a worksheet. We'll switch our focus to creating charts and working with both the chart
3:06
editor setup and customize options. We'll explore pivot tables and how to create and use named ranges
3:14
before ending the module by learning how to protect sheets and ranges.
3:20
In Module 5, our focus will strictly be on using Google Docs.
3:25
This is the Google Workspace word processing application. We'll learn about its display screen and then move on to
3:32
changing the view of a document. Along the way, you'll learn how to insert images and page numbers.
3:39
We'll use styles in our document and learn how to access the document outline.
3:46
We'll end this module by collaborating with Suggesting Mode and working with comments.
3:52
Google Slides will be the focus of Module 6. Slides is the Google Workspace presentation app.
4:00
After understanding its display screen, you'll learn how to enter text on a slide and learn how to change the view of a presentation.
4:10
You'll learn how to add an image to a slide and how to add, delete, and reorder slides.
4:16
We'll apply a theme to our presentation, which will make it more visually appealing.
4:22
and learn how to add transitions and animations to keep the audience's interest.
4:28
We'll finish this module by delivering a presentation and using both presenter view and audience tools.
4:38
Module 7 is all about Google Forms, the form creation app in Google Workspace.
4:45
After understanding its display screen, we'll create a form, add questions
4:50
to it, send a form, link a form to a spreadsheet, and view form responses.
4:58
We'll direct our focus to Google Meet, the Google Workspace video meeting app.

5:59
Before we get started, I'd like to say that I will be using two
Types of Google Accounts
6:05
Google Workspace business accounts. during this course. Now, you can also be successful if you have access to two
6:14
personal Google accounts. Although there are a handful of features that you won't be able to use if you're
6:22
using a personal account, at least you'll get to see these features on screen.
6:28
because of the type of account I'm using in this video. In addition, it would be helpful if you had two different accounts
6:35
that you can use, and that might be an easier proposition if you're using personal Google accounts.
6:44
Also, We'll be using a handful of files that are in the video description, so
6:50
you may want to go ahead and grab them, and there's also one folder in there. You might want to grab everything and store it somewhere on your hard drive
6:59
that you can access during this course. In our first module, we'll begin using Google Drive.
Introduction to Google Drive
7:08
We have 15 lessons in this module. We'll start by signing into Google Apps and using the Google Apps menu.
7:18
We'll go over the Google Drive display screen, and then you'll learn how
7:23
to change drive display options. We'll create a file from within Drive and move on to making a copy of a
7:33
file and moving a file to Trash. Now we do have files in the video description we'll
7:39
be using for this course. In Lesson 8 of Module 1, we'll be uploading Two of those files from a
7:48
hard drive and they're named learn it logo, which is a PNG file and
7:55
2022 sales, which is an Excel file. In lesson nine, we're going to create and manage folders.
8:03
In lesson 10, we'll be uploading a folder from a hard drive. And also in the video description, you'll see a 2021 sales folder
8:14
that we'll be using in that lesson. You'll also learn how to search for files, how to add shortcuts
8:22
to My Drive, Well, your drive. And in Lesson 13, you'll learn how to work with Drive Priority and Workspaces.
8:32
They're only available if you have a Google Workspace business account.
8:38
We'll move on to changing Google Drive settings, and then end this module.
8:44
by signing into multiple Google accounts. The first thing we're going to do is go to google.
Signing Into Google Apps
8:51
com and we're going to sign in to Google apps.
8:57
And when you use the blue sign in button in the upper right hand corner of the screen, it signs you into all of the Google apps.
9:07
So we're going to do that right now. I'm going to go ahead and click sign in, and this is where I give my disclaimer.
9:14
I will be using two business accounts through this course.
9:19
At the end of this module, you'll learn how to add another account so you can switch back and forth between multiple accounts.
9:27
The accounts that I'm using, I created just for these videos.
9:33
And so in other words, if you try to email me at any of the email addresses you see
9:39
me using, you will not get a response. So I'm going to go ahead and put in what I call my primary email address, and then
9:51
I'm going to go ahead and click next. It's going to prompt me for my password and I can show it by checking this box.
10:00
And once I have it in, I'm going to go ahead and click next.
10:07
So it takes me back to google. com, but this time when I look in the upper right corner, Instead of the
10:16
blue sign in button, I have access to my account, represented by the letter
10:22
T, the first initial of my first name. And to the left of that, you will see a series of nine dots.
10:35
And we're going to use the apps menu to access Drive.
Google Apps Menu
10:45
From within Drive, let's go to the apps menu.
10:50
And you can see that I can get to my account from here. Here's all the apps that I can get into.
10:58
And as I keep scrolling down, you'll see other apps that are connected as well.
11:07
Let's review the drive display screen. So you already know where the apps menu is.
Google Drive Interface
11:14
And also to the right of that is how you can access your Google account. I'll go over to the upper left.
11:21
The icon for Drive and the word Drive are both links. So sometimes, if you're just sitting in Drive and you're working on other windows
11:31
on the internet, Drive may get stagnant. And so you can click on Drive or the icon in order to refresh the screen.
11:41
Underneath that on the left, this area on the left is known as your menu.
11:46
And this is one of the things you won't have if you're using a personal Google account.
11:52
You won't have the priority there. And so don't worry about that. Like I said later on, you'll see how that works even if you don't have it.
12:02
My Drive is like your main repository. So whenever you go to Drive, unless you have priority and you switch
12:10
it, it will always go to My Drive. Now, I happen to have a folder in here from another Google course that
12:18
I did, but your drive may be empty and you're going to learn more about
12:24
how to use it during this module. And then there's another one that's shared drives, where you can have
12:32
a shared drive that you use if you're like working with a team.
12:38
Then there's shared with me, any files and folders that have been shared with me would show up here.
12:45
I have my, some things under recent from a previous course that I did.
12:54
Starred is just another way for you to easily find files or folders.
12:59
You can star them and then they, everything that you star will be in that starred category.
13:06
And then you have trash, which is where anything that is deleted will go.
13:11
And it empties the trash after 30 days. The items in trash will be deleted automatically after 30 days.
13:19
Unless you go in and manually tell it to empty the trash. And then at the bottom it gives you the amount of storage
13:27
that you're currently using. And it allows you to get to...
13:35
So when I go into storage, it again is showing me the total amount used and it divides it in a business account, at least it does.
13:44
So it's telling me how much in drive gmail photos, and then it lists all the
13:49
files that are using drive storage there. So I'm going to just go back to my drive.
13:58
Now at the top, you have your search bar, right? You can search anywhere in Drive, whether it's in any of these
14:05
different categories, it will find it, and you'll learn how to search.
14:11
In order to get help, you can use the question mark to go to support, and then you have a gear that takes you through settings.
14:21
The middle of the screen is showing you My Drive, anything that you have in My Drive.
14:26
So I happen to have a folder there. If I had Files there, it would be a category called Files, so on and so forth.
14:34
And My Drive is a drop down where I can recreate everything.
14:40
that is on that new button at the top of the menu. So I can do it over at new, or I can click the down arrow on my drive to
14:51
access the same menu to the right. You have an icon.
14:57
And that will let you switch to list layout. Um, if I click on it, it switches to grid layout.
15:05
And once we get some files and folders in here, we'll revisit the layouts.
15:11
And then you have, you'll notice on the right, you have this details and activities screen for my drive.
15:19
I can close it by using the X in its upper right hand corner.
15:24
And then that information icon. is view details so I can get that panel open again.
15:34
And now we're going to create a file from within Drive. Again, we can use the new icon on the menu on the left or your My Drive dropdown.
Creating Files
15:46
Either way, you'll see that you have New Folder, File Upload, Folder
15:52
Upload, and then you have Google Docs, Google Sheets, Slides, Forms.
15:59
And more, and we're going to hover over the arrow to the right of Google Docs
16:06
and we're going to choose blank document.
16:12
And I'll show you here that the untitled document opened on a
16:17
new tab in your browser window. You'll learn more about the common features across most workspace
16:26
apps and more in depth about Google Docs in a later module.
16:33
But for right now, if you have a summary... an outline window open on the left.
16:39
You can close it by using the left arrow. And where it says type at to insert, we're going to just
16:48
type a brief sentence or two. So I'm going to type google drive.
16:54
Microsoft is the file storage app in Google Workspace.
17:05
You can store Google Apps files as well as other file types.
17:17
And in parentheses, I'm going to put Microsoft Office, comma, PDF.
17:27
F comma dot MP4 comma, et cetera, in drive.
17:39
And so notice at the top, it's either saying saved, right?
17:45
If it already disappeared, where it's that little cloud with the check mark, if you hover over that, it will say, see document status.
17:59
And so you can see that all changes have been saved to drive.
18:05
And that this document is not ready for offline use. And I'm gonna just ignore that for right now.
18:12
So, it's automatically saving. Um, here it lets me know that the last edit was seconds ago.
18:22
And in the upper left where it says untitled document, if you hover over there and you click, it's going to want to name it like the first sentence you type.
18:34
And I'm gonna just modify that. I want the name to just be Google Drive.
18:43
And when I do that edit and press enter, It gives it that name, and it's saved in Drive.
18:52
So, because I'm kind of done with this document now, the Google Drive
18:57
doc that we just created, I can close the browser tab that it's on,
19:04
and I'm still in My Drive, and now you can see I have a Files category.
19:12
And it shows that Google Drive document.
19:18
Now I'm going to show you two ways. That you can copy a file in Google Drive.
Copying Files
19:25
Now before we do that, I have this file selected and I can tell that it's selected because the name of the file at the bottom has blue shading.
19:34
And I want to look at this details on the right side. So it's showing me a little preview of the document and when I click on
19:42
it, it takes me into the document. Alright.
19:48
And I'm going to go ahead and close that browser tab. It also lets me know who has access, details about the file, including
19:58
where it's located when it was last modified, opened, and created, and
20:04
where you can add a description. So one way you can copy a file is you can right click, I'm gonna right
20:11
click on that Google Drive file, and I'm gonna choose Make a Copy.
20:16
It lets me know in the lower left that it's creating a copy, and then that it did create a copy.
20:23
And I'm gonna dismiss that pop up. And you can see that I have Google Drive and Copy of Google Drive.
20:32
Since the Copy of Google Drive is what's selected, I'm going to just do
20:37
control C on my keyboard to copy it. And then I'm going to click anywhere on my drive screen and do control V.
20:49
And it's going to give me a pop up, which I'm going to allow.
20:55
So in the lower left hand corner, it lets me know that it's working.
21:01
And now you'll see that I have Google Drive, copy of Google Drive,
21:07
and copy of copy of Google Drive. I like to give options.
Deleting Files
21:13
So just like I showed you two different ways to copy a file, I'm going to show you two different ways of moving a file to...
21:22
the trash. So you don't want it anymore. You don't need it anymore. I'm going to right click on the copy of Google Drive file and down at the
21:32
bottom, I'm going to choose remove. And then it's going to confirm that I'm moving it to the trash,
21:39
that the copy of Google Drive will be deleted forever after 30 days. I'm going to click on move to trash.
21:48
Now, another way of doing it, And you can see in the lower left, you can undo that if you need to.
21:55
Another way of doing it is by dragging and dropping it onto trash. So I'm going to do the copy of the copy of Google drive.
22:04
I'm going to just click and hold on it and I'm going to drag it over to trash on the menu on the left and drop it.
22:12
I get the same confirmation and I'm going to choose move to trash again.
22:20
Now let's go to trash. And I mentioned earlier when we were doing our tour of the screen that
22:28
Everything will be deleted after 30 days, unless you want to ever manually come in you can do that and choose to empty trash up in the right.
22:40
I'm going to go back to my drive. I'm also going to show you two different ways to upload a file
Uploading Files
22:49
from your hard drive to drive. And the first way is I'm going to use the new button on the left.
22:56
And I'm going to choose File Upload. And then I'm already in the directory where I had the files
23:03
from the video description. And I'm going to select the LearnIt logo and choose the Open button.
23:15
So it lets me know in the lower right and the upload is now complete. I can close that panel.
23:21
And under my files, I now have that PNG Learn It logo file.
23:28
Another way to do it is to arrange your screen so you can see the file
23:34
directory where you have the files from the video description, as well as your drive screen at the same time.
23:44
So now that I have them arranged like this, this is the hard drive on my computer, and then I have my drive, I am going to just grab this 2022 sales Excel
23:56
file, click and hold it, and drag it over, and you'll see that it puts a blue border.
24:04
around where your folders and files are in Drive and it says drop files to upload them to my drive.
24:12
I'm going to let it go up there and it's uploading one item. The upload is complete.
24:17
I'm going to maximize my drive screen again.
24:23
And you can see that we used the new button to get the Learn It logo uploaded.
24:29
And we dragged and dropped 2022 sales Excel file.
24:35
For organizational purposes. You may want to create folders in your My Drive, and so we're gonna do just that.
Creating and Managing Folders
24:46
Now. I can do it from either the new button or the My Drive dropdown.
24:53
I'm using MyDrive dropdown this time, and I'm gonna choose new folder and
24:59
I'm gonna name the folder 2022 Sales.
25:06
and click on create. So now in my folder section, I have my previous folder that I have and I have
25:15
this newly created 2022 sales folder. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to drag the 2022 sales Excel file and
25:24
drop it on top of the new folder and it moves it from my drive into that folder.
25:36
So if I double click, The 2022 sales folder, I'll see that Excel file in it.
25:44
And up at the top, I like to point this out, I call it like a breadcrumb trail. It's letting me know where I am.
25:50
I want to click on my drive there to get back to my drive.
25:56
Now that we have some files and folders, let's take a look at our view button in the upper right.
26:03
I click on it and it changes it to list layout. So if you want everything listed like this, you could.
26:09
You would have your folders first and then any files and then the grid layout
26:16
is the way that it was originally. So I just figured I'd point that out to you.
26:22
We saw it a little bit earlier. So you, and that's a personal choice. It depends on how I'm working, which layout I prefer to use.
26:31
Now let's talk about some other things you can do with folders. Let's right click on our 2022 sales folders.
26:39
Now, a lot of these things you can do if you right click on a file. Um, a folder has something else there.
26:47
You can search within the folder from this right click menu. And you can change the color.
26:53
I'm going to change the color of that folder to like an orange color. Just because, right?
27:01
Now the other thing you need to know about folders is this. Let's drag that 2022 sales folder to Trash and it lets us know that
27:13
it will be deleted after 30 days. Move it to Trash. Well, the thing is, is when you delete a folder or you move a folder to Trash,
27:24
any files within it are also in Trash. Let's go to our trash folder, right click on 2022 sales folder, and choose
27:36
restore, and then go back to my drive. So the thing is, is if you want to delete the folder, but keep the file, you would
27:45
have to move the file out of the folder. before you delete the folder.
27:51
Just like we uploaded a file, you can do it from drag and drop or from new, you can
Uploading Folders
27:57
also upload a folder from your hard drive. So, I'm gonna go to new.
28:04
And I'm a choose folder upload and it already has me in my directory
28:10
and there is a 2021 sales folder and I'm going to double click it
28:17
or click it once and choose upload. So it's asking me for permission to upload a file to this site.
28:25
I'm going to choose upload. So the upload is complete and now I have a 2021 sales folder.
28:35
And when I double click it, I can see that there is an Excel file inside of it.
28:43
I'm going to go back to my drive, and go ahead and give your 2021 sales folder a color.
28:53
So I've decided to keep all my sales folders the same color, and I colored my Google Forms, my previous folder, with another color.
29:04
When we did our tour of the display, I pointed out that you can search from the search box up top.
Search
29:11
And you saw when we right clicked on a folder, that we have the ability to search within the folder.
29:18
Let's go ahead and click in the search box up top.
29:23
And you can see, well this is another login of mine, so just ignore that. You can see that you can search for documents, spreadsheets, presentations.
29:34
So on and so forth. You can actually search based on the name of the file or
29:41
folder or contents within it. So in the search box I'm gonna type logo and notice that it will pull up any
29:51
file that has the word logo in its name.
29:56
I'm going to use the X on the right side of the search box to clear the search, and
30:02
this time I'm going to search for sales. And so I get four results, right?
30:08
I get my sales Excel files as well as both sales folders.
30:16
And I'm going to do the X on the right again. Now, all the way to the right of the search box, you have an
30:24
icon, and when you hover over it, it says, Show search options.
30:29
Let's click on that. So this is where you can get more specific. I can search for any type of file.
30:38
And there's even more types here. Then are in the search box.
30:44
I can search by the owner of the file so anyone things that are owned by me
30:51
not owned by me or owned by a specific person a file that has certain words
30:58
in the file an Item name which is a term that matches part of the file name
31:05
like when we did logo and we did sales the location It's set to anywhere.
31:11
It could be in trash, starred, or encrypted, date modified, if you're
31:18
using approvals, it's awaiting my approval or requested by me, or
31:24
files that have been shared to a specific person or email address.
31:30
We're going to put in the, has the words box, Google workspace.
31:38
And at the bottom, we're going to click search. So I have a couple of things.
31:45
I have something extra in my drive from a previous course that's in my forms
31:51
folder, my Google forms folder, but you should have that original Google drive
31:56
doc as a result in which we use the word. Google Workspace, and I'm going to do the X in the search box, and the
32:08
other thing I'm going to do is, in the search box, with all of these icons
32:13
here, I'm going to click on folders. So it's showing any folders that you may have.
32:22
And I'm going to clear the search again, and just go back to my drive.
32:31
Now let's say that you find yourself Still working on the 2021 sales
Adding Shortcuts to My Drive
32:39
and 2022 sales Excel spreadsheets, both of which reside in folders.
32:47
Now, if you look at the top of your My Drive window, you have Suggested.
32:53
If you search for a file or you open a file, it may add it to the Suggested list.
32:59
What I'm going to do is I'm going to right click on the first file I have under Suggested, and at the very bottom, I'm going to choose Not a Helpful Suggestion.
33:11
So it removes it from my suggested list. I'm going to do that with the other file that I have up there as well.
33:19
Sometimes I just don't want the clutter and I don't want the suggestions that my drive makes for me.
33:27
So that's how you can remove them. Now if I'm working on those two spreadsheets often, say like every day
33:33
for a while, maybe I'm doing some analysis or the comparison between the sales over the two years, whatever the case may be, I don't want to have to come into Drive,
33:44
go into the folder to access the file. So I can add shortcuts to my Drive.
33:51
And we're going to do this right now. Let's double click the 2021 sales folder.
33:59
And then we're going to right click on the 2021 sales Excel file.
34:05
And choose add shortcut to drive. And it gives you some options as to where to place it.
34:15
I'm going to leave it on my drive, and at the bottom, I'm going to choose add shortcut.
34:22
So now when I go back to my drive, you can see, if I go down under my files,
34:29
That it has a little curved arrow icon on 2021 sales Excel file, which indicates
34:37
that there's a shortcut to that file. And if I hover over the file name, it tells me it's a shortcut.
34:45
So now what I'd like you to do is the same for 2022 sales, go into the folder
34:52
and make a shortcut of the Excel file. And now in my drive, you'll see both shortcuts.
35:01
So an easy way to access files that you're frequently working on. And at the end of the day, if you right click on a shortcut file, right?
35:13
You see shortcut options. You can move it to somewhere else, add it to star, rename, all of
35:20
that, make a copy, uh, remove. So, we added shortcuts to my drive to make it easier to locate files without having
Working with Drive Priority and Workspaces
35:33
to go through different folders and stuff. Now if you have a Workspace Business Account and you have Priority on the
35:42
left side at the top of your menu. You can work with Drive Priority and Workspaces, which is even
35:50
more efficient than My Shortcuts. So, once you add important or frequently accessed files to a
35:58
workspace in Drive Priority, you can set Priority to be your homepage.
36:04
And then that way, every time you go into Drive, You will automatically
36:10
see important or frequently accessed files as soon as you open the app.
36:16
So again, if you're using a personal account, you will not be able to do this, but you can either skip this portion of the video or watch
36:24
to see what the feature does. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my priority on the left side.
36:31
It still will have suggested things in here. I can collapse. that area.
36:38
And here it wants me to create a workspace. So I'm going to create a workspace and I'm going to call it all sales and create.
36:51
So now I can add files to this workspace. I'm going to click the add files button and on the right hand side, it'll come up
37:00
with recent files that I've used, right? Then it's broken out by.
37:05
Like today yesterday last week and of course, there's a couple of ways to do this I'm gonna focus on these two sales Excel files.
37:15
I can Select each one by just clicking on them and at the bottom It will tell
37:21
me that there are two selected and I can insert or I can drag and drop them
37:27
I'm going to go ahead and insert, so now I have, and by the way at the top
37:33
it lets you know that you can have a 25 file limit in any workspace.
37:39
So at the bottom right I'm going to select done. And then I have one other thing that I need to do.
37:47
And that is, I need to go to settings. So that's the gear icon in your upper right.
37:57
And I'm going to choose settings. And again, my storage may look different than yours if you have a personal account.
38:06
And also you'll notice as I go down, when I get to the bottom on the
38:11
general tab, I have the opportunity to make priority my default homepage
38:18
and I'm gonna select that option. And then I'm gonna use the left arrow in the upper left to go
38:26
back to get out of settings. And I'm gonna just go to my Google Apps menu and I'm gonna go into Docs.
38:37
And then I'm going to close my Drive tab in my browser.
38:45
I'm going to use the Apps menu again to go back to Drive. And this time when I go in, Priority is my home page.
38:54
So it takes me directly to my Sales workspace, in this case.
39:00
And I can have other workspaces in here as well. And when you have a workspace, and this one's called All Sales, If I go over to
39:09
the more actions ellipses, I can hide the workspace or remove it or rename it.
39:16
If I hide it, then it will show up down at the bottom under hidden workspaces.
39:24
By the way, when I add files to my workspace, it does not remove
Google Drive Settings
39:29
them from their original locations. So if I go back to my drive here, And I go into my 2021 sales folder,
39:38
there's that Excel file, and I'm going to just go back to my drive. So we went into Google settings to enable priority as our home page.
39:51
And let's go back in to the gear in the upper right and go back into settings.
39:57
So you can become familiar with the other settings. So there's general settings, notification settings and manage app settings.
40:06
And again, my settings may differ from yours if you're in a personal account.
40:11
Um, so my storage again, broken down as showing here, I can convert
40:17
uploads to Google docs editor format. I can change my language settings here.
40:24
I can allow the ability to create, open, and edit recent Google Docs,
40:30
Sheets, and Slides files while offline.
40:36
My density for the view is comfortable. So, first I'm going to get out of settings.
40:43
And I'm going to put this in list layout. I'm going to go back to settings.
40:52
And, my density is comfortable, I'm gonna change it to cozy, go back, looks
40:59
pretty much the same to me, right? Go back to the gear again, settings, and I'm gonna change it to compact, which
41:10
should make it be a little bit closer. So now I can see a change.
41:17
I'm gonna go back into settings. and change it back to comfortable So it's spaced a little bit more and
41:26
then at the bottom under General you have suggested files So, if you are
41:33
always unhappy with the suggestions it makes, you can turn off that setting.
41:39
I find myself hiding or saying this suggestion doesn't work for me a lot, so
41:45
you may want to turn off that setting. Um, I'm going to turn it off for the shared with me section as well.
41:54
I'm going to leave Make Priority My Default Homepage checked.
41:59
And when we get ready to share, I'm going to leave this checked. Show Suggested Recipients in the Sharing dialog.
42:06
So those are your general settings. On the left, let's go to Notifications.
42:12
So you can get updates about Google Drive items in your browser if you like, if you want to check that.
42:19
I'm gonna uncheck get all updates about Google Drive items via email.
42:27
You know, you just get so many emails during the day and... For me, when I'm working in the apps, I always have drive open.
42:36
So I don't really need the notifications for myself personally.
42:42
And you can also get all updates about Google drive items while you're working in Google chat.
42:48
And I'm going to uncheck that one as well. That's just my personal preference.
42:53
And then the last section on the left is manage apps connected to drive.
42:59
And so, you have all the apps here, and the ones that are managed by Drive
43:05
are checked to be used by default. Um, anyway, I'm gonna back out of settings.
43:17
And last but not least, in this module, I'm gonna show you how to sign
Signing Into Multiple Google Accounts
43:22
into an additional Google account. So I'm going to just simply go up in the upper right hand corner and click on my
43:30
T, which represents my Google account. And here I can choose add another account.
43:39
So it's going to force me to log in. Now this is another email address that is not operational in terms of to the public.
43:50
It's been created just for this course. So if you email it, you will not get a response.
43:56
So I'm going to put in my alter ego email here
44:04
and choose next and go ahead and enter my password and next again.
44:16
So because I was in Drive under my Trish account, when I signed
44:23
in, it brings me into Drive for my A account, my alter ego account.
44:30
And not only that. You can see that I have two different Drive browser tabs open.
44:38
I'm on my Alter Ego one, and if I go to the other one, it's still logged in to my T account.
44:47
But if I go to T again now, you'll see that I'm signed in in my T account.
44:52
and also my alter ego account. So I can switch tabs.
44:59
Now for the purposes of training, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the My Drive for my A account.
45:08
I'm going to right click on that tab and I'm going to move that tab to a new window.
45:15
For the purposes of training, it would be easier for me to switch windows. Then to switch tabs.
45:22
So I'm logged in to both my workspace account, my workspace training account, and my alter ego account.
45:31
And before I end this module, because all of you may not be in business
45:37
accounts, I'm gonna go back to settings. And I'm gonna not make Priority my default homepage again.
45:48
Just so I'm on the same My Drive whenever I go in and out of Drive as some of you may be.
45:58
To recap Module 1, we began using Google Drive. We started by signing into Google Apps from google.
Google Drive Recap
46:07
com. You learned how to use the Google Apps menu to navigate to the Drive app.
46:13
And then we reviewed the Google Drive display screen. You learned how to change Google Drive display options from list to grid view.
46:22
And we revisited that later in the lesson when we actually had files in folders to see the difference.
46:30
In the fifth lesson, you learned how to create a file from within Drive. We created a very brief document.
46:39
And then we moved on to learning how to make a copy of a file in two different ways.
46:44
How to move a file to trash in two different ways. and how to upload a file from a hard drive in two different ways.
46:55
We went on to creating and managing folders and uploading a folder from a hard drive.
47:02
You learned how to search for files, how to add shortcuts to My Drive for easy
47:09
access to files, and how to work with drive priority and workspaces, which
47:16
then you can make priority your homepage. For the important files that you're working on.
47:23
And that will show up whenever you go into Drive. We reviewed and changed some Google Drive settings.
47:31
And then we ended by signing into multiple Google accounts.
47:37
Which I then moved my additional account. to a new browser window.
47:46
In Module 2, we'll be collaborating in Google Drive. We'll start by sharing a file or folder.
Introduction to Google Drive Collaboration
47:54
Then you'll learn how to share a link to a file or folder. And we'll end after the third lesson by publishing to the web.
48:05
Now we're going to share a file. The process would be the same for sharing a folder.
Sharing Files and Folders
48:11
So the file that I want to share is the Google Drive doc that we created earlier.
48:19
And I'm gonna just right click on it, and click on Share.
48:26
I could have also chosen Manage Access on that Details panel on
48:31
the right to get to this screen. So here I can add people and groups that I want to share with.
48:38
Um, my other account is already here, otherwise I could type in the
48:43
email address to get it to pop up. I'm gonna just select my other account, my Alter Ego account, and notice to
48:53
the right, it defaults to Editor. on my drive.
48:59
So that's the type of access. If I do the drop down next to editor, I can switch it to viewer, where they
49:08
won't be able to make any changes at all. They'll just be able to read the document.
49:13
Commenter, where they can suggest changes to the document. editor is full access to the document.
49:21
I could also add an expiration date and time for this access.
49:28
If I don't add an expiration date, access will automatically expire
49:34
30 days from when you share. At 11 59 p.
49:39
m. I'm gonna leave Alter Ego with editor access.
49:44
I don't have to notify people. It's nice if you do, but I don't have to.
49:50
I choose not to here. They would get an email if I notified them.
49:55
I'm just going to simply do share.
50:00
In the lower left it lets me know that access has been updated.
50:06
Now I've switched over to my alter ego drive and you can see that the
50:12
google drive doc is there and it's saying it was shared just now by me.
50:18
And it will also show on the left in the menu under shared with me.
50:25
So you can see how it goes into the person's drive, even if
50:30
you don't send them a message. I'm back in my primary account, my Trish account, and I'm in my drive still.
Sharing Links
50:41
This time we're going to share a link to a folder. So under my folders, I'm going to right click on 2021 sales and choose get link.
50:55
Now this screen looks very much like the share screen, but what we're going to do in the bottom left, we're going to go ahead and click on copy link and it
51:08
lets you know the link has been copied. And we're going to choose done.
51:13
Now I can distribute that link in a few different ways, Gmail,
51:19
chat, so on and so forth. I'm going to go to my apps menu.
51:25
And I'm going to launch chat
51:30
and at the top in the search box I'm gonna click and for me it will automatically
51:37
bring up my other email address my alter ego Email address if not, you can type in
51:44
a person's email person's name if they're in your contacts So on and so forth.
51:50
So I'm gonna just select alter ego and at the bottom The very bottom of the
51:56
screen where it says history is on, that's where I am going to type my message.
52:03
So I'm going to just say, please review as discussed.
52:12
And then I'm going to do control Z to paste the link in.
52:19
And notice it shows the 2021 sales folder here. And I'm going to go to the bottom right corner where the blue right
52:28
pointing arrow is to send the chat.
52:33
And once I do that, even though you're sending a link, You still have to give the
52:38
person access to the folder or the file. So it's saying it's already marked, share with people, alter ego.
52:48
I'm going to give them editor access to this folder and then in the bottom right, click send message and it sends the chat message.
53:01
I'm going to switch back over to my alter ego. Browser window so in alters account the shared folder is already in Drive
53:13
Now if they weren't in Drive and say they had their chat open I'm gonna go ahead to the apps menu and go to alters chat and click on it on the
53:25
left Because they've been given access they could use the link in the chat.
53:31
So if they're working in Drive They'll see it once the screen refreshes or if not, their chat will notify them that they have the link.
53:40
Now this is because of my settings that I have set up.
53:46
So that's why this person is automatically getting what I'm sharing
53:52
with them in their drive because of how I have those features set up.
53:59
And now I want to show you one other thing. I'm back in alters drive account and I'm just going to right click on that
54:06
2021 Sales folder that's in my shared with me and I'm going to go to get link.
54:14
So down here at the bottom, you can see the general access is restricted to only
54:21
people with access can open with the link. So that's why when we sent the link via chat, It made us, it required
54:30
us to give alter ego access as well. If I do the drop down next to restricted, since I'm in a business
54:39
workspace account, I can change this to people within my organization.
54:46
So anyone that I send a link to within my organization will
54:51
automatically have access. Or the other choice is anyone with the link, whether they're in or out of your
54:59
organization would be able to have access.
55:05
I'm going to just click done on that. If you want to share with a broader range of people, then via link
Publishing to the Web
55:17
or using the share feature, you can publish a file to the web.
55:24
Let's go ahead and open. I'm back in my primary account, by the way. I'm going to open the 2021 sales folder.
55:32
And then I'm going to double click that Excel file and it will open in Google Sheets.
55:39
And so when it's open in the application, I can go to the file menu, hover over
55:49
share and notice that from here I can share with others similar to sharing
55:55
from drive or I can publish to the web. I'm going to select Publish to Web.
56:03
In this dialog, you have a Link tab and an Embed tab.
56:11
On the Link tab, underneath Link, it says Entire Document, and I'm going to do the
56:16
dropdown there and just select Sheet 1. That's the only thing that has data in this file.
56:23
Now, it says that you can make your content visible to anyone
56:29
by publishing it to the web. You can link to... or embed your document on a web page.
56:36
We're going to leave it on link. There's a drop down next to web page where you have other
56:43
file types that you can choose. We're going to leave it on web page.
56:49
And when you click on publish, At the top, it will ask you are you sure
56:56
you want to publish this selection. We're going to say cancel for a moment.
57:01
And I'm going to expand published content and settings at the bottom.
57:07
So, it says entire document again. When I click on entire document from that drop down, it'll let me select sheet 1.
57:17
I can restrict access to the following. Now, when I check that, it defaults to my organization.
57:26
Right? So I can restrict this access when I publish it to the web. It's only for people within my organization.
57:34
Otherwise it's anybody that can access it will be able to get to it.
57:40
And the bottom check mark is automatically republished when changes are made.
57:46
So I can click start publishing down here.
57:51
or the publish button again, and it's going to confirm it and I'm going to choose okay.
57:58
So what it does is it generates a link, right? And I can share the link.
58:07
By using Gmail, Facebook, or Twitter, anyone with the link that I share it
58:14
with will be able to access the document.
58:19
And so what I'm going to do is, I'm going to just do Control C and copy that link.
58:28
So I've switched to a browser window. And I am going to paste the link into the address bar and press enter.
58:40
And in the browser, it shows me that 2021 sales sheet.
58:49
In this second module, collaborating in Google Drive, we learned how to share a file or folder.
Google Drive Collaboration Recap
58:56
We also learned how to share a link to a file or folder, and ended
59:02
by publishing a file to the web.
59:07
In Module 3, we'll be working with Common Features, features that are common
Introduction to Essential Google Workspace Features
59:13
across many of the Google applications. We'll begin by opening a Google application in the first lesson
59:21
of nine, and we'll move on to using the menu and the toolbar.
59:26
You'll learn how to use help, how to create a new file. How to rename a file.
59:34
How to email one. And in Lesson 7, you'll learn how to download files in other formats.
59:42
In Lesson 8, we'll be using a Microsoft Office file that's
59:47
in the video description. It's called Welcome and it's a Word document.
59:52
And you'll learn how to open that file in a Google app. And we'll end by working with versions.
1:00:02
To work with common features, we're going to be using Google Docs as our example.
Opening Google Applications
1:00:09
So I'm going to go up to my Apps menu, and I'm going to choose Docs.
1:00:17
Now, we should all have the Google Drive doc listed here under recent documents.
1:00:24
I have another file listed there as well. And what we're going to do under start a new document,
1:00:30
we're going to click on blank. So we've been in docs before, but now we're going to tour the common features.
1:00:40
We're also going to create a little bit of a document here while we do so.
1:00:45
So we have an untitled document here. We opened the docs app.
Creating New Files
1:00:51
And we chose the blank template to get where we are now. I want to show you a different way, another scenario that
1:01:00
you might find yourself in. So let's go use the blue icon in the upper left corner that will
1:01:07
take us back to Doc's home page. And we're going to open the Google Drive document that we
1:01:14
created earlier in the course. And I just double clicked on it to open it up.
1:01:21
And so on this document, let's say we have this open, we're working on it, we know that every change we make is being saved to Drive, and
1:01:29
we want to start a new document. We don't have to go back to the Docs homepage to do so.
1:01:38
We can use The file menu and so I'm going to click on file hover over new
1:01:46
and on the right side choose document.
1:01:51
So now I have a new blank document again.
1:01:58
So now in this document, we're going to type a few lines here. The first of which is features common between many Google apps, enter.
Inputting Data
1:02:15
We're going to type opening a Google application, enter,
1:02:23
creating a new file, enter.
1:02:29
So these are some of the topics we're covering in this module.
1:02:35
And we'll type one more here for right now. Using the menu and the toolbar.
1:02:46
Now let's spend a few moments exploring the menu. So I'm going to click on File.
Menu and Toolbar
1:02:52
We already used New. You can see that you can open from here, make a copy, share, email, download, seek
1:03:02
approvals if you're using that feature. It's a fairly new feature.
1:03:07
Uh, rename, move, add a shortcut to drive, move to trash, version
1:03:13
history, which we'll cover. make available offline, and then you have details, language, page setup, and print.
1:03:21
Now, it is true that many of the applications have a menu bar,
1:03:27
but depending on the application, The options may differ.
1:03:32
We have an edit menu here, with your undo, redo, cut, copy, paste, paste
1:03:40
without formatting, so on and so forth. You have your view menu.
1:03:47
We have an insert menu, all of the things that you can insert into a document.
1:03:54
And it has a little bit of a scroll bar. You have format tools, extensions, and help.
1:04:07
So those are your basic menu options again. And some of the apps, some of the options, for example, on the format
1:04:15
menu or the insert menu or even the file menu will differ depending on the app.
1:04:22
And then you have your toolbar. Some of the things that you can do from the menu, you can do from your toolbar as well.
1:04:30
So for example, let's do this. Let's select the first line that we typed and from the menu, we're going to
1:04:40
go to the Hover over paragraph styles and choose subtitle or hover over it
1:04:49
and then on the right apply subtitle. So we changed the style of that line that was selected.
1:04:56
And then we look at it and we're like, we want a different style. So right there on the toolbar directly under the word format on the menu, you'll
1:05:06
see the styles and it says subtitle. We're going to go to the dropdown there.
1:05:12
And we're going to choose title. And we think, eh, nah, don't like the way that looks.
1:05:20
We're going to go to the drop down again, the styles drop down, and change it back to subtitle.
1:05:28
And if you click directly on the word subtitle, it will apply it so you don't have to use that right pop up menu.
1:05:37
Let's select the remaining three lines.
1:05:43
And on the toolbar, Let's italicize them by using the I.
1:05:49
Now you know, the same shortcut keys. If you're a Microsoft Office user, we have some of the same shortcut keys, so
1:05:57
we could have done control I for italics. Now we're gonna do control home.
1:06:05
Controlling your home key will take you to the very top of a document. Conversely, control end will take you to the very bottom.
1:06:15
So we want to be at the top. And we're going to press enter once. And then use your up arrow to get all the way at the top
1:06:22
again or control home again. And we're going to go to the insert menu this time.
1:06:30
And on the insert menu, we're going to select date and you're going to select
1:06:36
today's date, whatever it is for you. And now we're going to learn how to use help from within an application.
Help
1:06:46
We're going to go to the help menu and we're going to choose help
1:06:53
and the help dialogue will open. It will show you some popular help resources at the top.
1:07:02
And then as you scroll down, you can see that you can visit the help forum. You can search help, ask the help community, and also
1:07:12
send feedback to Google. We're going to click where it says search help, and we're going to type bullets.
1:07:20
So it will come up with two different topics, which are indicated by
1:07:27
the little piece of paper icon. And, both of them are the same, add a numbered list,
1:07:33
bulleted list, or checklist, and that's what we're looking for. So, I'm going to click on the first one of those, and it gives me, whether
1:07:43
you're doing this on your computer, on your Android device, or on your
1:07:48
iPhone or iPad device, the different ways that you do things, I'm going
1:07:54
to leave it on computer, and it gives you the step by step of what to do.
1:08:02
Then it goes on to other topics similarly related.
1:08:08
So I'm gonna use the X in the upper right hand corner to close help, and we're
1:08:15
gonna select the three italicized lines.
1:08:20
And on the toolbar, we're gonna go over to the right. You'll notice it has a dropdown too.
1:08:27
Click the dropdown to the right of bulleted list so you can choose what kind of bullet you're going to use.
1:08:34
I'm going to just go for the default one, which means I can just click right on the bulleted button, and it applies the bullets to those
1:08:43
three lines that we have selected. Now click in the upper left where it says Untitled Document.
Renaming Files
1:08:51
When you hover over that, it says Rename. And when we click in there, it's going to put in whatever is on the first
1:08:58
line, which in this case is the date. This is another area where you have two choices.
1:09:05
We could go to the File menu and choose Rename, or we can just click up in that
1:09:13
Rename box at the top that has the date. I'm going to select the date in that box.
1:09:20
And I'm going to name the file common features. And then I just click away from the box and it is renamed.
1:09:31
And then just for variety sake, I'm going to go to file rename, and it
1:09:39
just brings me back up into that box. I'm going to click at the end of features in type of space
1:09:48
and add on in Google apps. So common features in Google apps.
1:09:56
Is the ultimate name of the file. As you saw earlier on the file menu, you can email a file to anyone.
Emailing Files
1:10:06
It doesn't have to be someone in your organization. It doesn't have to be someone that even has a Google account.
1:10:13
So I'm going to go to file. And I'm going to hover over email and then email this file.
1:10:21
And I'm going to send it to another Gmail account that I have.
1:10:28
And again, this account, if you email it, you will not get a response.
1:10:33
And it has the subject, which is the name of the file. The message is, This is what I told you about.
1:10:47
Feel free to let me know what you think.
1:10:53
Something like that. And then I have a choice. I can not send it as an attachment, but include it in the email.
1:11:02
I'm going to not check that, right? I want it to be an attachment.
1:11:08
At the bottom, it gives you the file type that you can use. I'm gonna leave it as a PDF.
1:11:16
And I'm going to click send. So now we're going to add to our bulleted list.
Downloading Files in Other Formats
1:11:24
I'm going to click at the end of using the menu and the toolbar and press enter.
1:11:29
Get another bullet there. And we'll type in renaming a file.
1:11:35
Enter emailing a file.
1:11:42
We might as well add the rest of the topics that we're covering here to common features.
1:11:47
The next one will be downloading files in other formats.
1:11:56
Then we have opening a Microsoft.
1:12:01
Office file in a Google app.
1:12:08
And the last one is working with versions.
1:12:18
And you see sometimes that a word will pop up when you start typing it. If you press tab, you'll just accept that word.
1:12:26
And so now what we're going to do is you're going to learn how to download this file in another format.
1:12:35
So we're going to do that from the file menu. You're going to hover over download.
1:12:41
And it gives you quite a few different formats that you can choose. And we are going to choose PDF.
1:12:48
So now, it lets me know that that file, and you can see the
1:12:55
PDF symbol, has downloaded. And if I wanted to, I could open the file.
1:13:02
I don't necessarily need to do that. So it's in my regular downloads folder.
1:13:09
To open a Microsoft Office file in a Google app, we're going to use...
Opening Microsoft Files in Google Apps
1:13:15
File, open command, and when we get in here, you're going to go
1:13:23
to the Upload tab at the top. Now I can drag a file here or I'm going to click on Browse, and I'm going to
1:13:34
choose a Word document named Welcome, and it lets me know, well, it went
1:13:42
really quickly, but it uploaded it. So now if I go back to Docs Home, I can open that welcome doc.
1:13:56
And so one thing I want you to notice at the top, right next to
1:14:01
the rename box, it says docx and when you hover over that it lets you
1:14:07
know it's a Microsoft Word format. So now we'll begin working with versions.
Versions
1:14:17
Let's go to the file menu again. Hover over version history, and we're going to choose name current
1:14:26
version, and we're going to call this version original from word, and save.
1:14:40
We're going to use control end to get to the end of the document,
1:14:45
and press enter one time. We're going to type this course teaches you to collaborate.
1:14:57
And notice how the word with is there waiting for me. I'm going to press my tab key to collaborate with
1:15:04
several Google Workspace apps.
1:15:13
I'm going to go back to file, version history, and name the current version.
1:15:22
And this one is going to be added description of course.
1:15:33
And save. Going to press enter again.
1:15:38
And this is the last thing we're going to type in here. These features are common with colon.
1:15:49
Enter. Let's grab our bulleted list. And we're going to type docs, sheets, and slides.
1:16:02
And we're going to go back to file version history again. Name current version.
1:16:08
And it's going to be added bulleted list of apps.
1:16:19
And one last time, we're going to go back to File, hover over Version History, and this time, we're going to choose C, Version History, and
1:16:30
it opens on a panel to the right. So, on that panel, The added bulleted list of apps is highlighted, and
1:16:38
that's why those are selected on the screen, on the dock, and when I hover
1:16:44
over it, it will pop up my name. I can go see the previous version, Added Description, of course.
1:16:53
And then, of course, original from Word. And next to all of those versions, you have an ellipsis more actions button.
1:17:03
So you can restore a version, rename a version, remove...
1:17:10
a name and make a copy of a version.
1:17:15
Now the last version there, which is the one at the top of the list does not have restore because that is the current version.
1:17:25
And down at the bottom of that version history you have show changes. So that's automatically checked and that's why it was highlighted
1:17:35
on the document itself. So if I check it back, you'll see the highlight corresponding.
1:17:43
And now that I've reviewed my version history, you'll notice also, there's
1:17:50
kind of a little bit of a toolbar there where you can print the stuff out. It tells you it's total one edit based on that version.
1:17:57
If I made multiple edits in a version, it would let you know how many I made.
1:18:03
And I can use these. here. It's moving between, if I had multiple edits, it would move between previous
1:18:11
and next edits to get out of here. I can use the arrow, the back arrow in the upper left hand corner.
1:18:22
In this module, we began working with some of the features that are common
Essential Google Workspace Features Recap
1:18:28
to some of the Google applications. Now you'll notice that I changed the order of the lesson.
1:18:34
So we began by opening a Google application, specifically Docs,
1:18:41
and then we created a new file. So we started with the blank template, and then I showed you how to go
1:18:49
to the file menu and choose New. We moved on to using the menu and the toolbar and learned how to use the
1:18:59
help feature before renaming a file.
1:19:04
We moved on to emailing a file, downloading files in other formats,
1:19:11
and we opened that Welcome Word document from within Google Docs.
1:19:19
We ended by working with versions and viewing the version history.
1:19:27
In Module 4, we'll spend 13 lessons using Google Sheets.
Introduction to Google Sheets
1:19:32
We'll start by understanding the Sheets display screen, and then we'll move on to inputting data.
1:19:39
We'll create formulas. work with functions, and work with the Google Sheets function list.
1:19:47
We'll move on to formatting numbers before previewing and learning how to print a sheet.
1:19:54
In Lesson 8 we will be creating a chart, and in Lesson 9 we'll be working
1:20:00
with the chart editor setup options. When we get to Lesson 10 you'll learn about the chart editor customize
1:20:07
options, and then we'll switch our focus to working with pivot tables.
1:20:13
and then creating and using named ranges and protecting sheets and ranges.
1:20:22
So I'm back in my primary account, my drive. And the thing is, I usually hang out in my drive all day.
1:20:30
Sometimes I have to refresh the screen, but it's worth it because from there,
1:20:35
I can get to the apps menu or use the new drop down to create new things.
1:20:42
We're going to use the apps menu. And we're gonna go to Sheets.
1:20:49
And from the Sheets home screen, we're gonna choose Blank.
1:20:55
So just like with the Common Features, you get, in this case, Untitled Spreadsheet.
1:21:01
It has a menu bar and a toolbar. Toolbar has some extra icons at the end, like this one has
1:21:10
functions at the end of the toolbar. And you have the ability to format numbers from the toolbar when you're in Sheets.
1:21:18
The file menu is pretty much the same, except that you have the availability to import in Sheets.
1:21:28
And so, we're going to talk about the display screen. And then get started working in this application.
1:21:37
So let's focus on the upper right. The first thing you'll see is an arrow icon.
1:21:45
And that's when you hover over it, it's just letting you know that this new file has not been saved yet.
1:21:52
The next icon over is to open comment history. And you'll learn about that later in the course.
1:22:00
You have the ability to join a call here. Or if you're in a meeting, you can present this tab to the call so you can
1:22:11
share your screen from this icon here. If I do the drop down next to that icon, you can start a new meeting or
1:22:21
use a meeting code to join a meeting. Then you have your share icon.
1:22:27
When I hover over that, it tells me that this blank sheet. is private to only me.
1:22:34
And then I have my account information. Now you'll notice on the right side, you have this sidebar, and this allows
1:22:41
you to gain access to other apps. So you have calendar, you have keep, which is a note taking app.
1:22:49
You have tasks, you have contacts, and you have Google maps there.
1:22:56
The plus sign will allow you to get some add ons and all the way at the bottom.
1:23:01
You have a right pointing. where you can hide that side panel if you're not using it.
1:23:08
And then the left pointing arrow, you can show it again. I'm gonna go ahead and keep mine hidden for now.
1:23:16
So everything at the top is pretty much the same. Again, there'll be differences on your menu options and on your toolbar.
1:23:25
But underneath your toolbar to the left, it currently says E4.
1:23:32
That's like the name box. It lets you know what cell is active right now, and I happen to be on cell E4.
1:23:39
There's other uses for the name box. To the right of the name box, it's kind of set up the same as Microsoft Excel.
1:23:49
So this wide blank area here is your formula bar.
1:23:54
Then you have your spreadsheet, you have your column headings, your ABCs.
1:24:02
You have your row headings, your 1, 2, 3s, and at the very bottom, you have a
1:24:10
plus sign that you can use to add a sheet.
1:24:17
So, if you want another sheet, by default, when you go in, it gives you one blank sheet.
1:24:23
You can use the plus sign to add... More sheets. And next to that, there is a lined icon that says all sheets, and it's just
1:24:33
showing you sheet one, which is the only one we have in this file at this time.
1:24:40
And then to the right side, Down at the bottom to the right of your sheet
1:24:46
one tab all the way to the right you will see Another icon and when you
1:24:53
hover over that one, it will say open explore I think this might be a business
1:25:01
workspace feature But when I click on that it allows me to get insights
1:25:06
instantly So it says to see answers, formatting, and charts in a single click, try adding more data or selecting different cells in your spreadsheet.
1:25:16
We don't have anything in the spreadsheet now, so there's nothing there. I'm gonna close that panel.
1:25:24
So, we're gonna start by inputting some data. The intersection of a column and a row is called a cell.
Inputting Data
1:25:32
So, when I click here, I am now in cell A1, column A, row 1,
1:25:39
and that's where we want to be. So, we're gonna just type in some numbers.
1:25:46
I'll show you some cool shortcuts along the way that will work great for training purposes.
1:25:51
So, I'm going to type the number 10 and press enter.
1:25:57
And then I'm going to click back on cell A1. And you notice in the lower right hand corner of the cell, there's a
1:26:05
little blue box and it's a handle. When you put your mouse on the handle, it looks like a thin black cross.
1:26:14
You're going to click and hold on the handle. and drag down until you get to cell A5 and let go.
1:26:23
So cool way to copy something, right? We have the number 10 in A1 and we drag the handle down to A5 and it just
1:26:34
repeated, it just copied the number 10. Now I'm gonna have you do control and the letter Z, which is undo.
1:26:45
So it gets rid of the duplicate tens, and we still have a 10 and a one.
1:26:52
Now click on a two and in cell A two, I'm gonna type the number 20 and press enter.
1:27:01
Then I'm gonna select cell A one and a two. If I point my mouse to the middle of cell, a one click and
1:27:09
hold and just drag down one. And you'll have both of those cells selected.
1:27:16
And right now, if you look at your name box in the upper left corner, right underneath your toolbar, you'll see That it says A1 colon A2,
1:27:30
because I have two cells selected. The colon represents a range, and it's inclusive.
1:27:36
So cell A1 through cell A2, including both of those cells, are selected.
1:27:45
And so with them selected, you'll notice the bottom most selected cell has the handle.
1:27:51
You're going to put your mouse on the handle and drag down to A5 again.
1:27:58
And because we put in two numbers instead of when we originally
1:28:04
dragged the handle on 10 and it just copied 10, it's repeating a series.
1:28:09
So it goes 10, which is kind of a cool shortcut to know.
1:28:17
We're going to do control Z again to undo. And in cell A2, you can double click the cell to get into edit mode, or
1:28:28
you can go up to the formula bar where you see the contents of the cell.
1:28:34
So you see the 20 up in the formula bar. We're gonna just change that 20 to a 40, and now we're gonna select both of
1:28:42
those cells again, and this time we're gonna drag the handle on the 40 cell on
1:28:48
a two, just drag it down to row four.
1:28:54
So now it's putting 30 increments of 30 between each number, 10,
1:29:00
40, 70, 100, which is pretty cool.
1:29:05
And now we're going to go to cell B1, and we're going to type 130, press enter,
1:29:13
and now we're going to type 180 in B2, and I'm going to select both of those
1:29:20
cells, drag the fill handle down to row 4.
1:29:27
And now I'm going to show you another data entry shortcut. So the first thing we want to do is we want to insert a
1:29:33
new empty row above row one. So I can just right click on the row one header and choose insert one row above.
1:29:47
So it shifted everything else down. In cell A1, you're gonna type Q T R 1, and press your tab key this time.
1:30:01
When you press tab, it takes you to the right. When you press enter, it takes you down one row.
1:30:07
And it enters the thing. So we have quarter one and A1. Now we really want quarters one through four.
1:30:14
And instead of typing them, I'm going to click back on A1, grab its handle, and drag it over to D1.
1:30:24
It will repeat that series for you as well. So less typing for you.
1:30:30
In cell E1, You're going to type regional totals.
1:30:38
And now we want a new column to the left of column A.
1:30:44
So just like we did with the row, I'm going to right click on column A's header and choose insert one column left.
1:30:54
So now notice regional totals is in F1 because it inserted a new column and
1:30:59
adjust everything over to the right. In cell A2, You're going to type east and press enter, west, enter, north, south.
1:31:16
And then we're going to have in a six quarterly totals,
1:31:26
and we're going to go ahead and name this file. So I'm going to go up to the rename box that says untitled spreadsheet,
1:31:36
and I'm going to name it 2021 sales.
1:31:44
Click away from there. And now I just want to draw your attention to this...
1:31:50
Arrow that used to say this file has not been saved. Now it says document editors can see your view history for this file.
1:32:01
So now I'm going to show you how to create formulas. I'm going to go to cell A20.
Formulas
1:32:10
And every formula or function has to begin with the equal sign so that Sheets will know to do a calculation on what you're putting in.
1:32:19
So I'm going to type an equal sign in cell A20.
1:32:25
And then I'm gonna type B2 for the cell reference.
1:32:32
So you notice when I type B2, if you look at the actual cell, it, it's shaded.
1:32:41
And if you look where we're typing the formula, it has the same color shading on B2.
1:32:48
And right above that, it's showing you the value that's in that cell. which is 10.
1:32:55
We're going to type a plus sign, and then we're going to type B3.
1:33:01
It gives B3 a different color, another plus sign, B4, yet another
1:33:11
color, and another plus sign, B5.
1:33:18
So now at this point that we have the last one in, It's telling us the actual total 220.
1:33:26
So when I press enter, you'll see 220 and sell. A 20.
1:33:33
So you can use your plus sign for addition, your minus sign for subtraction.
1:33:40
You can use the asterisk for multiplication and the slash for
1:33:45
division when you're doing formulas. I'm going to click on cell A 20 and press delete on my keyboard
1:33:56
to get rid of that formula. Now, I typically use functions in sheets, formulas.
1:34:06
You're typing a lot. They kind of lend themselves to errors. Functions are like packaged formulas that you can use.
1:34:14
And that's what our next topic is going to be. And now we're going to go to cell B6.
Functions
1:34:22
I can show you a little trick here. If you go up to your name box, you can just type B6 and press enter,
1:34:30
and it will take you to that cell. In B6, we're going to type our equal sign, and this time,
1:34:38
you get something different. If you look underneath where you typed the equal sign, it says tab, and then it
1:34:46
says sum, and in parentheses, B2 colon B5.
1:34:52
And then it gives you the result of that function, which is 220.
1:34:59
So, when we did the formula, we were too far away from the data in
1:35:04
A20 for it to be able to detect it. When you're near the data, in this case, we have numbers right above
1:35:13
where we're putting the function, and it's going to be able to detect those
1:35:18
cells, and it will give you the default. Sum function, and that's the function that we want to use.
1:35:26
So in order to use it, all we have to do is press our tab key, and
1:35:33
it puts that function in for us. And if you look up at your formula bar, you'll see the function, the sum function,
1:35:41
and then in parentheses, the arguments, which are B2, the range of B2 through B5.
1:35:51
Now, the really cool thing is that we don't have to repeat that
1:35:58
function for the other quarters. We can just drag its handle. Now we don't have any data in for quarter three and quarter four, but we're going
1:36:07
to click on B6 and we're going to drag its handle to the right until we get to E6.
1:36:18
And so, B6. Is still what's showing in the formula bar, and that's the
1:36:25
sum of B two through B five. If we click on C six, we'll see that it adjusted for column C, so that's
1:36:33
the sum of C two through C five. Now we have zeros for quarters three and four, but if we click on the quarter
1:36:43
three zero, you'll see it adjusted for column D in the formula bar.
1:36:49
And the same with. E6, which represents quarter four.
1:36:54
Now that means that once we fill in the numbers for quarters three
1:36:59
and quarter four, the formula will automatically update to show the sum.
1:37:05
Now let's click in cell F2. right under regional totals and type your equal sign.
1:37:15
So sometimes the farther away you are from numbers, like when we were in a 20,
1:37:22
it won't give you any function help, but this time it's able to detect that we
1:37:27
have numbers to the left of where we are. And so it's going to select all of the cells to the left, B2 through E2.
1:37:37
And it has the sum function, which we can just press our tab key to tab it in.
1:37:46
Now let's say that you click on that cell and you type equal and
1:37:52
it doesn't give you the suggestion. You don't have to do this. I'm going to type equal and then I'm going to type sum.
1:38:00
And I'm going to just, because it wouldn't have the sum B2 through E2 there if it's not giving you a suggestion.
1:38:06
So I'm going to just select the sum function, and then I can click and drag
1:38:12
B2 through E2, and then press enter.
1:38:19
So that's kind of how that works. I'm going to select F2.
1:38:24
And I'm going to drag its handle all the way down to F6.
1:38:33
So we're seeing our regional totals. So far I have 140 for the east region, so on and so forth.
1:38:41
And all of these formulas will update when the quarter three and quarter four numbers are filled in.
1:38:50
Sheets has a functions list that you can use. And so let's go to cell G2, and we're gonna go up to the Insert menu, hover
Using the Google Sheets Functions List
1:39:05
over Function, and you'll see at the top they have the top five functions,
1:39:12
Sum, Average, Count, Max, Min. Then you can get a look at all functions.
1:39:18
And then they have them broken out into category. And what I tell people is don't worry about the category.
1:39:25
If you're looking for a function, just go to all, and they're all in alphabetical order.
1:39:31
Now, in our case, we want to use the average function. I can get it from the all list, or I can, since it's one of the
1:39:39
top five, I can get it at the top. I'm going to select average there.
1:39:45
So in G2, using the function list, It put an equal average and notice right
1:39:52
underneath it, it's giving you what's called the syntax of the function,
1:39:58
which means you have the word average and then the arguments in parentheses
1:40:04
could be value one, comma, value two, comma, or you can click and drag a range.
1:40:12
to get your argument in. So what we're going to do is we're going to click and drag B2 through E2.
1:40:21
We don't want to get the total in there. Just B2 through E2 and press enter to get the average.
1:40:31
And then on my screen, it pops up suggested auto fill, right?
1:40:37
So notice it's kind of filled in The average function for G3 through G6.
1:40:46
And I want to keep that autofill so I don't have to drag the handle.
1:40:51
So I'm gonna do the check mark on that. And then it puts those numbers in pretty permanently.
1:41:00
And I decided we don't want it in row 6. So that last one, I'm gonna just click on that 260.
1:41:08
And press delete on my keyboard. And then I'm going to go to cell G1 and I'm going to type regional, and I'm
1:41:17
going to abbreviate averages to A V G S period, those are my regional averages.
1:41:26
So now what I'd like you to do. In cell A7, I'm going to have you type quarterly averages
1:41:41
and then in B7, I'd like you to use the average function to calculate
1:41:49
the average of quarter one and then you can use the handle to drag it over to the other quarters.
1:41:57
I'm going to have you kind of do that one on your own. You can pause the video and do it and when you resume, I'll have it done on my end.
1:42:06
When you're done, you'll see the divide by zero error in D and E7, and that's
1:42:14
because you can't divide by zero, and it uses division when it's calculating
1:42:20
the average, so I'm going to select D. and E7, and press delete.
1:42:26
Once the numbers get filled in, I can actually drag over the average
1:42:31
function then, and not have to look at the error on the spreadsheet.
1:42:37
And so now, if you go to cell G5, the regional average for the South,
Formatting Numbers
1:42:44
we're gonna drag its handle down to G7, and we're gonna go to cell G6.
1:42:52
and press delete. So this way we'll get our quarterly averages totals over here as well.
1:43:02
It's all going to end up being the same number if you were to fill in the rest of the data.
1:43:08
So now what we want to do is we want to select all of the numbers that we have.
1:43:16
except our averages. So all of the numbers and I'm even selecting the blanks in
1:43:22
quarter three and quarter four. And this way we can format these numbers.
1:43:30
We can format numbers from the format menu, which we're going to do. You can also do some number formatting from the toolbar.
1:43:38
So on the toolbar, there's a dollar sign where you can format your numbers as currency.
1:43:44
or as percentages, and then you can decrease or increase the decimal places.
1:43:51
And then you have more formats there, that 1, 2, 3 button, which has a drop
1:43:57
down, so you can see the other types of numeric formats that you have available.
1:44:04
So toolbar. This time we'll use the menu. I'm going to go to Format, Menu.
1:44:10
Hover over number and there's that same list from the drop down now on that list.
1:44:18
I want you I want you to look at currency and look at the example of
1:44:24
where the dollar sign is placed The dollar sign is placed flush up against
1:44:30
The left side of the number and then for accounting and it's just showing
1:44:37
a negative there, but for accounting the dollar sign is like left justified.
1:44:44
I'm going to select accounting because I prefer all of my dollar signs to
1:44:51
be left justified and I'm good with the two decimal decimal places there.
1:44:59
And so if you wanted to, you can go back to format number and you can
1:45:07
choose currency there and you can see how the dollar signs are flush up against the left edge of the number.
1:45:14
For me, it's really. In my situation anyway, it's a personal preference.
1:45:20
I prefer accounting. So I'm going to go ahead and change mine back to accounting.
1:45:28
So now let's make believe that we just got our quarter three and quarter four numbers.
Previewing and Printing Sheets
1:45:34
So I'm going to go to cell D2 and let's see, I'm going to type 310, and then
1:45:44
in, press enter, and in D3, I'm gonna type 340, just keeping with our trend.
1:45:50
I'm gonna select those two, and drag the handle down to D5.
1:45:58
And you'll notice that the total, now populated, It's not a zero there.
1:46:04
And in cell E2, I'm going to type 430, enter, 460, and
1:46:16
then fill those down to E5.
1:46:22
So now we have our totals. These totals over here updated, as did our averages.
1:46:29
And the only thing we have to do now is grab our average function,
1:46:36
and I'm going to just select C2. and drag it to D and E2.
1:46:43
And then your regional averages are over here to the right as well.
1:46:50
When it comes to preview, previewing and printing a sheet, you can use
1:46:55
your file menu and choose print at the bottom, or you can just do control and
1:47:02
the letter P to open the print settings dialog, where you'll see a preview.
1:47:10
of your work. On the right side, it lets you know, by default, it's going to print the current sheet.
1:47:17
If we had cells selected on that sheet, we could choose to print just the selected cells.
1:47:23
In my case, I'm on G12 and I want to print this sheet versus just that one cell.
1:47:28
I have my paper size, all of that kind of stuff, right?
1:47:33
On the right side, you have a formatting drop down where you can show grid lines.
1:47:42
or show notes and we don't have either in ours.
1:47:47
You can do the page order alignment, all of that. And at the very bottom, you have a headers and footer section,
1:47:55
which we are going to expand. You have the ability to add page numbers, workbook titles, sheet
1:48:04
name, current date, current time. We are going to check the box.
1:48:10
in front of workbook title. And now you can see on your preview that it has the title of the workbook
1:48:18
in the upper left hand corner and like the edit section at the bottom,
1:48:25
we can click on edit custom fields. And so you're seeing that workbook title.
1:48:34
in the left header section. So that both the header and the footer have left, center, and right sections.
1:48:42
And you can come in here and pretty much type anything that you want.
1:48:48
In the header center section, where it says click to add text, I'm
1:48:54
going to just type company name. So any generic company, company name.
1:49:00
And in the right header section, I'm going to type accounting department.
1:49:09
Something like that. In the right footer section, I'm going to click where it says to add text.
1:49:20
And you see those icons that pop up when you click in a section? The first one is page number.
1:49:30
The second one is where I could insert the workbook title or the sheet name.
1:49:37
The third one gives me the ability... to add a date and select the date format.
1:49:44
And the fourth one is for time, if you want that on a header or a footer.
1:49:50
We're gonna go to the first one, and we're gonna choose page number B, the
1:49:56
one that actually has the word page spelled out, and then the number.
1:50:02
And it puts it in as a code. So if I added more sheets in this file before this sheet, the page
1:50:11
number will adjust automatically. And then... Up in your upper right hand corner, you're gonna click on the blue Confirm
1:50:20
button, and now you're still in Print Preview, and you can see the work that
1:50:26
you did from editing custom fields. Now in the upper right hand corner, you have a blue Next button.
1:50:35
And we're going to click it. And this is where it gives you the ability to actually print.
1:50:40
You get another preview here and you can change your printer settings.
1:50:45
And then just click the blue print button in the lower left hand corner.
1:50:52
So now I'm going to actually cancel my print screen. I'm not going to physically print this out and we're going to switch
Charts
1:51:00
our focus to creating a chart. So the first thing I want you to know is when you're creating a
1:51:06
chart, you have to tell it the data that you want in the chart.
1:51:11
If you don't, it will select data and put it in the chart for you.
1:51:17
So we're going to select from A1 through E5.
1:51:26
So we want our regions, our quarters, and the mythical sales figures.
1:51:34
In our chart, and we're going to go to the insert menu and click on chart.
1:51:42
So it automatically gives us a stacked column chart.
1:51:49
It has a chart title of quarter one, quarter two, quarter three, and quarter four.
1:51:54
You see that you have your east, west, north, and south as a legend underneath the title.
1:52:02
And I can hover over any of those stacked columns. So I'm on the first one for East, the green one.
1:52:10
And that's the East quarter four total is being represented there.
1:52:18
I'm going to go to the ellipsis button in the upper right corner of the chart.
1:52:23
And I'm going to choose edit chart. And that chart editor opens up on the right side again.
1:52:31
So we're going to say that we don't want a stacked column chart.
1:52:37
That's not the type of chart that we want. That's the default type that it gave us based on what we selected.
1:52:46
So we're going to use that chart editor to change some of our setup options.
1:52:53
So, on the Chart Editor panel, the first thing that you run into on the Setup tab is the Chart Type.
Chart Editor Setup Options
1:53:01
And we're going to do the drop down next to Stack Column Chart.
1:53:06
And it will make suggestions based on the data that you selected, or you can choose
1:53:14
a different type of chart on your own. So they're grouped by, there's several different types of line charts,
1:53:22
there's area charts, column, bar, pie, scatter, map, other charts.
1:53:29
And we're going to go with a suggestion. So if you have the suggested one, A regular column chart, if you don't have
1:53:38
it suggested, you can go down to column and pick just the basic column chart.
1:53:46
Either way will work. So, the only difference between the suggested is it kind of shows your data.
1:53:53
The other are just kind of like... Temporary placeholders, so I'm going to select the column chart under
1:54:00
selected, and I like that better, and so it changed everything. It changed the legend to the quarters, right?
1:54:09
So the East is all together, and there's it's quarter one, right?
1:54:15
Quarter two is red, so on and so forth.
1:54:22
And then we don't want any stacking. The data range is there.
1:54:30
It shows what's showing on your x axis, right?
1:54:35
Which is our, um, regions.
1:54:40
And then underneath x axis, you have a box that you can check that says aggregate.
1:54:46
Now, look at the series underneath it. And you see how it has quarter one, quarter two, quarter three, quarter four.
1:54:53
When you check the aggregate box, it shows you that it's using the sum function.
1:55:00
And we can do the drop down next to aggregate type if we want in the chart to
1:55:06
see a different aggregate like average, max, median, min, so on and so forth.
1:55:14
Down at the bottom you can switch your rows and columns. And it's using row one as headers.
1:55:23
So we've just reviewed the chart editor setup options. Now we're going to go to the customize tab.
Chart Editor Customize Options
1:55:31
So we can review the chart editor customize options.
1:55:36
And so the first thing we're going to expand is chart style, right?
1:55:41
We can give our chart a background color.
1:55:46
Change the font. Give it a border color.
1:55:51
Right? You have some other things you can do in terms of the chart style. So I'm going to start by going to background color.
1:55:59
And I'm going to use like a pale orange color. Or a little bit paler than that.
1:56:08
Yeah, I'll go with that one. A pale orange color. I'm gonna leave the font the way it is.
1:56:14
I'm okay with the font. I'm gonna give my chart a border color, which is gonna be a dark orange color.
1:56:25
And underneath that, you'll see that you can reset your layout. So if you do a bunch of changes here and you don't like them, you can reset them.
1:56:34
There are three check boxes. I'm gonna check maximize. And you notice how it maximizes the columns in the chart.
1:56:44
I'm gonna uncheck maximize. I'm going to check 3D, and I'm gonna leave that.
1:56:51
Now these are check boxes, so I could have it maximized and 3D, but I don't want mine maximized.
1:56:58
I like it in 3D though. Each column has a 3D effect on it.
1:57:05
And then you have your third checkbox there, which is compare mode.
1:57:12
Well, go ahead and click on compare mode.
1:57:17
And I hover over a bar because of compare mode. So I'm hovering over the quarter four east column.
1:57:25
And it's showing me the values for the other quarters for the East.
1:57:30
That's what happens when you have compare checked. I'm going to go back to my ellipsis and go back to edit chart and back to
1:57:39
customize going to expand chart style.
1:57:45
So without compare mode, I'm going to uncheck it, click away from that.
1:57:53
And when I click on the East green bar, it's just showing me the quarter for value.
1:57:59
for East, not the others. So, Compare Mode is really cool.
1:58:06
I'm gonna go back to the ellipsis and get back to there. Edit chart. And so, I like having Compare Mode on.
1:58:14
It just gives me more ability to analyze my data.
1:58:20
I'm gonna collapse the Chart Style section and expand Chart and Axis Titles.
1:58:29
And for my chart title, I'm gonna go down and select that text, and I'm gonna
1:58:35
call it 2021 quarterly sales by region.
1:58:46
So it updates the title on the chart. I'm good with the font and its size and its formats and all of that.
1:58:55
I might want to change my title text color. I'm going to make it a really dark orange and then I'll make it bold
1:59:03
to stand out a little bit more. Maybe orange is not working there. I might go with a green color that'll stand out.
1:59:12
Yeah, and I'll leave it bold. So I just changed the color and made it bold.
1:59:18
You have a series section, right? Where you can format, line, colors, and stuff like that.
1:59:29
You also have the legend section. And in the legend section it's the same, where is the position of the legend.
1:59:37
It's automatically at the top. I'm going to do the dropdown and choose right.
1:59:44
So it moved the legend over to the right side. of my chart.
1:59:52
You have a horizontal axis where you can change the labels and stuff like that.
2:00:00
Um, so here it's talking about east, west, north, south. And one of the things you can do with those labels under slant labels where it
2:00:09
says auto, I'm going to do 30 degrees.
2:00:14
Just adds a little bit more visual interest. I think. Again, this is personal preference stuff here.
2:00:22
And then you have options for your vertical axis as well. And under that one, I'm gonna check the box.
2:00:31
So the vertical axis is where your numbers are on the left side of the chart. I'm going to check the box that says show axis line and it gives
2:00:41
you like a dividing line between the axis and the chart itself.
2:00:48
You can also change your minimum and maximum values. So this is the thing.
2:00:57
I'm going to just move my chart down a little bit. You know, we use the fill to get these numbers and our highest number
2:01:04
is 400 or actually 520, right? And this axis is starting with like zero and going to 600 and that's
2:01:16
pretty okay for our range of numbers. Sometimes you might want to change it so it looks better.
2:01:26
And then I'm going to collapse that vertical axis section and expand grid lines and ticks.
2:01:36
So it starts with the vertical axis here and you, and that's a drop line so
2:01:42
I could do for vertical or horizontal. And then I'm going to scroll down.
2:01:47
So you notice you have different options for horizontal versus vertical. Vertical has major spacing types and major steps.
2:01:56
Minor spacing types, minor counts, major grid lines, if I uncheck that,
2:02:02
you'll notice the grid lines disappear. And I'm gonna recheck major grid lines.
2:02:10
And I can also have minor grid lines, which I'm gonna check, so you get those more faded out lines in between the major grid lines.
2:02:21
If I scroll down, I can see major ticks. So here, on your axis, on your vertical axis, you have those little crosshatches.
2:02:33
Those are the major ticks. Basically next to each value.
2:02:39
And then, it gives you the ability to change the tick's position and its length.
2:02:45
I'm gonna leave it on cross. And then you can have minor ticks as well.
2:02:51
So you get subsequent ticks. on your vertical axis.
2:02:58
At this point, you can go ahead and close your chart editor panel by using
2:03:04
the X in its upper right hand corner. And we're going to select our chart and we're going to do control C to copy it.
2:03:17
And then at the bottom of your screen, you're going to do the plus sign to add a sheet.
2:03:22
And it gives you sheet two. It puts you in cell A1 and you're going to do control V to
2:03:31
paste the chart onto this sheet. So for sheet two, I want to rename the sheet.
2:03:37
You'll notice next to sheet two, there's a dropdown, right? I can do all of these things, or I can just double click where it says sheet
2:03:47
two, and I'm going to do 2021 chart.
2:03:54
And then for sheet one, I'm going to rename sheet one to 2021 sales
2:04:02
data and on sheet one, I'm going to select the chart and delete it.
2:04:12
So I could have cut and pasted it, but I wanted you to know how to delete a chart as well.
2:04:19
I'm going to go to our 2021 chart sheet and show you something else.
Pivot Tables
2:04:25
I'm going to select the chart and then go to its ellipsis in the upper right.
2:04:30
And from here, I could have moved the chart to its own sheet or made a copy of the chart as well.
2:04:37
So I'm just so used to doing control C, control V, or control X,
2:04:43
control V, that I do it that way. But you do have built in on that side menu.
2:04:49
The ability to copy the chart or move it to its own sheet.
2:04:54
And I'm going to go back to 2021 sales data tab so that now we can work with pivot tables.
2:05:03
And so what we're going to do again, just like with a chart, we're going to select the data that we want in the pivot table.
2:05:10
And so we are going to select from. A1 to E5, and we're going to go to the insert menu and we're
2:05:23
going to choose pivot table. So in the create pivot table dialogue, it's confirming the sheet that you're
2:05:32
on and the range that you have selected. And if you needed to change that, you could, you could go over
2:05:39
here and select the data range. And we want the pivot table to be on a new sheet.
2:05:45
So we're going to go ahead and click create. So pivot tables allow you to analyze your data because you have the ability to
2:05:55
pivot your data in a multitude of ways. For example, you could switch columns and rows.
2:06:02
You can add and remove fields, so on and so forth.
2:06:08
So what we're going to do is Over here on the right in your PivotTable editor,
2:06:18
you can see that it's showing, like I said, you're seeing the range there, and then you have suggested to add rows, columns, values, and filters if necessary.
2:06:30
To the right, it's showing you... what is in column A, right, which is our quarter, quarter information.
2:06:40
And so what we're going to do is we're going to click on the add button next to
2:06:46
rows and we're going to choose column A.
2:06:52
So now we're seeing our regions as rows. Each region is in a row.
2:06:59
In our pivot table. Now you'll notice here that it's in ascending order, right?
2:07:05
By alphabet. So east, north, south, and west.
2:07:11
And we can do the drop down next to ascending and your only other choice is descending there.
2:07:18
To the right of that you have it sorted by that column, right? And then it shows, show totals.
2:07:26
So we have, that's why we have that grand total. In row six on our, where our pivot table is being built.
2:07:35
And by the way, if you close the pivot table editor, which we're gonna do by using the X in its upper right hand corner, you can get it back
2:07:45
by clicking that edit icon that's right underneath your pivot table.
2:07:50
On our editor, we're gonna add to values.
2:07:56
And we're going to select quarter one. And we're going to leave it as a default.
2:08:03
We'll talk more about that in a moment. Go ahead, go back to add values, quarter two.
2:08:11
And notice as your pivot table is being built, you're seeing the sum of quarter one, the sum of quarter two.
2:08:18
We're going to go ahead and add values again.
2:08:23
And we're going to do quarter three. And we might as well add quarter four.
2:08:34
And you notice, next to values as, it's adding them as columns.
2:08:41
Our other choice is to add the values as rows. We're going to leave them as columns.
2:08:47
And so, If we look in our editor, it's summarizing by
2:08:53
sum, and it's show as default. You can show as a percent of the row, percent of a column,
2:09:00
or percent of grand total. We're going to leave it as default for all of those values.
2:09:07
And now we don't want it to say sum of quarter one, sum of quarter two, we just want it to say quarter one, quarter two.
2:09:14
I'm going to click on sum of quarter one in cell B1.
2:09:20
And go up to the formula bar and just get rid of SUM OF.
2:09:25
And I'd like you to do the same for the other quarters. And we can go ahead and close that pivot table editor window.
2:09:34
And there you have your pivot table.
2:09:40
Now I'm gonna go back to edit for just one more moment.
2:09:48
And just to point out that you have the ability to add filters at the bottom as well.
2:09:53
We're not going to do that. I'm going to close the editor window.
2:10:00
So basically to pivot in a pivot table, you can swap your values to show in rows.
Named Ranges
2:10:09
and your regions to show in columns. If we had more fields we were dealing with, we can add and remove other fields
2:10:17
to our pivot table so we can look at the data in a host of different ways.
2:10:23
And now you're going to learn how to create and use named ranges. But first, when we created the pivot table and we said to put it on a new sheet,
2:10:33
it named the sheet tab, pivot table one. I'm going to double click that. And just type 2021 sales pivot, and then I'm going to go back to
2:10:47
the 2021 sales data sheet tab. So what is a named range and why would you want to use one?
2:10:59
So named ranges make it easier to navigate to certain cells in your data
2:11:06
set, and they can also make formulas and functions easier to understand.
2:11:14
So let's start by doing this. Click on cell F2, where we have our east regional total.
2:11:23
And when you look at the formula bar, it says sum of B2 through E2.
2:11:29
It would be clearer if it said the sum of the East.
2:11:36
And again, earlier, I showed you how you can use the name box, which
2:11:42
tells you what cell you're currently on, to navigate to a different cell.
2:11:47
So I can click in the name box. And I can type A2 and press enter, and it will take me to that cell.
2:11:58
There are a couple of ways that you can define a named range. I'm going to show you what I call the easy way first, or the quick way first.
2:12:08
And what we're going to do is we are going to select B2.
2:12:13
through E2. We're going to go to the name box and when you click in there it
2:12:20
will select that range and you're going to type east and press enter.
2:12:31
So now if you click away from that and you select B2 through E2 it
2:12:36
now says east in the name box. As opposed to B2 colon E2.
2:12:47
Now, the other thing is, I can click on any blank cell anywhere, go to my name
2:12:53
box drop down arrow, and choose East.
2:12:58
And it will find and select those cells.
2:13:04
So that's one way of creating a named range.
2:13:09
Um, we'll deal with the formula issue. separately, but for right now you learned how to name one range.
2:13:17
Now, another way that we can name a range, instead of using the name box, go ahead
2:13:23
and select B3 through E3, right click anywhere within your selection, And at
2:13:33
the very bottom of this list, you're going to hover over view more cell actions and
2:13:40
you're going to choose define named range. So it opens up a named ranges panel on the right and we're
2:13:49
going to call this one West.
2:13:55
And so underneath you'll see the other named range that we completed by using the name boxes on this list.
2:14:03
But B3 through E3 is West and we're going to be. choosing done.
2:14:09
Now from here I can add a range as well from that panel on the right.
2:14:15
And this one, we're going to name it first. We're going to call it North.
2:14:22
And then right underneath it, it's still using B3 through E3.
2:14:28
To the right of that, you're going to choose select data range, and you're going
2:14:33
to go and select on your spreadsheet. B4 through E4, and notice it updates over here, on the right, and then you say OK.
2:14:47
Go ahead and create the named range for the South region on your own.
2:14:52
You can pause the video to do so. So I have my ranges in East, North, South, and West.
2:14:59
It will put them in alphabetical order. On that named ranges panel, and I'm going to go ahead and close that panel.
2:15:09
And now let's go to cell
2:15:14
F2 and just press delete, type equal.
2:15:19
And then I'm going to type the word sum and I see the sum by itself, the sum
2:15:25
function by itself on the list, right? So I'm going to click it on the list to get that function in.
2:15:33
Now it's still giving me a hint. You can see the list where it has B2 through E2.
2:15:39
But this time, I'm gonna start typing East.
2:15:45
And your named ranges will show up on this function list as well.
2:15:51
When I hover over East, it lets me know That it's on the 2021 sheet tab
2:15:56
and it sells B two through E two. So I'm gonna just click on east and press enter.
2:16:05
So now when I click on sell F two and I look at the formula bar, it says some
2:16:11
of east, which is a lot clearer than B two colon E two, and you can change.
2:16:22
Your other regional totals by referencing the named range.
2:16:28
So I'm going to click on F3 and this one, I'm going to do a little bit differently.
2:16:34
I'm gonna go up to the formula bar and just select B3 through E3.
2:16:40
And I'm gonna just start typing West. And it pops up on the list and I can tab that in and press enter.
2:16:50
So I have my East.
2:17:01
So named ranges make it easier to navigate to specific cells,
2:17:07
as well as make Functions and formulas a bit easier to understand.
2:17:14
So our final lesson in this module is protecting sheets and ranges.
Protecting Sheets and Ranges
2:17:20
So we're going to start by protecting a range. I want to select all of my data here on the 2021 sales data tab.
2:17:32
And then I'm going to right click on my data, go down to view more cell actions.
2:17:39
And over on the right, choose protect range, which is the same place
2:17:45
you'll go to protect the sheet. We're starting with the range. So I can enter a description for this range, and I'm going to say all 2021.
2:17:57
Sales data is my description. It's showing me the cells that I have selected.
2:18:06
And then I can go to set permissions. So, range editing positions.
2:18:13
When you protect the range, it's normally because You want to restrict
2:18:18
who can edit the range, right? Your only other choice is just show a warning when editing this range.
2:18:26
So, right now, only I can edit this range.
2:18:32
If I do the drop down, next to only you, I can do custom or copy
2:18:39
permissions from another range. I'm going to select custom. So, I can edit it and down at the bottom, I'm going to add my alter ego self as
2:18:55
someone else who can edit this range. And I'm going to choose done.
2:19:05
So now it's giving me this pop up that someone needs access to this. So I'll go ahead and share.
2:19:12
So the thing is, when you protect a range or a sheet, the content cannot
2:19:20
be changed, but it can be printed, copied, pasted, imported, and exported.
2:19:28
Right? So you only want to make sure you sharing this with trusted people.
2:19:33
Protecting the range is not like the best security measure that you can use.
2:19:43
So because I'm myself and I'm, and this is not shared with somebody else, I can change stuff.
2:19:50
But other people that would come in, if they try to type on any of the cells that we had to select it, it will not allow them to do that.
2:20:00
So only myself and alter ego. can edit this data.
2:20:06
I'm going to right click on any cell, go back to View More Cell
2:20:11
Actions, And back to protect range.
2:20:17
And this time I'm going to go to the sheet tab, right?
2:20:22
So when you go to protect the sheet, it's the same thing. No one can change anything.
2:20:28
Let's go to our 2021 sales pivot sheet. We'll do this one.
2:20:34
Our 2021 sales pivot sheet. And here on the, on the protected sheets and ranges panel, I'm going to change it
2:20:43
from 2021 Sales Data to 2021 Sales Pivot.
2:20:49
So, same thing. No one will be able to change anything, but they can print, copy, paste, so on and so forth.
2:20:57
For a sheet, you can say, Accept Certain Cells. So there are certain cells that you're letting people change, and the rest of
2:21:05
the sheet, they can't change anything. So, I'm not going to check that box.
2:21:10
I'm gonna choose Set Permissions, and I have the same permissions
2:21:18
that I've used before, so my alter ego, and I'm gonna do Done.
2:21:24
So, Protecting a Sheet. or protecting a range, you're using the same process.
2:21:32
It just depends on what tab that you're on.
2:21:37
And then I'm going to go to my 2021 sales data sheet, and I'm going to click
2:21:46
on the protected sheets and ranges box. I'm going to click where it says all 2021 sales data.
2:21:54
That's what the description I put in. Can edit.
2:22:00
And I'm going to go to change permissions. And I'm going to uncheck Alter Ego and choose Done.
2:22:12
So now only you can edit this range. And I'll do Done on that panel.
2:22:18
And that's how you protect Sheets and Ranges in Sheets.
2:22:24
We started Module 4 using Google Sheets by going over to Sheets display screen.
Google Sheets Recap
2:22:31
And then we started inputting data. We moved on to creating formulas and working with functions.
2:22:40
And, we actually worked with the Google Sheets function list as well. You learned how to format numbers and how to preview and print a sheet.
2:22:51
And then we switched our focus and we created a chart. We then worked with the chart editor setup options and the
2:23:00
chart editor customize options. We moved on to working with pivot tables.
2:23:08
Then we created and used named ranges. and ended this module by learning how to protect sheets and ranges.
2:23:19
We'll go through eight lessons in Module 5 when we begin using Google Docs.
Introduction to Google Docs
2:23:26
As usual, we'll understand its display screen, and you'll learn how
2:23:31
to change the view of a document. We'll be inserting an image and page numbers into a document, and then move on
2:23:41
to working with styles, using the document outline, collaborating with suggesting
2:23:48
mode, and end by working with comments.
2:23:53
I'm back in Drive. And from here, we're going to start our deeper dive into Google Docs.
2:24:01
So I'm going to use the new button on the left, hover over Google
2:24:06
Docs and choose blank document. The Docs display screen.
2:24:13
Has of course your rename box where you have untitled document, the
2:24:18
ability to get to the docs home screen, which you've seen before. And it also has the menu bar and the toolbar, which we
2:24:27
used a little bit earlier. In addition, It has the same icons in the upper right hand
2:24:36
corner that you saw in Sheets. Because it's Docs, you know, it doesn't have the column headers and the row
2:24:44
numbers or sheet tabs at the bottom. But on the left side, it has an icon that when you hover over it,
2:24:52
it says Show Document Outline. And you can select that now.
2:24:59
And then to collapse it, you can use the left arrow button.
2:25:05
And, you do have a ruler, you have two rulers actually.
2:25:10
You have one right underneath the toolbar, and you have another one
2:25:18
on the far left of your screen. So that we have some data, we're going to each type two short paragraphs.
Changing Document Views
2:25:29
And make them about two of your favorite things. It could be two foods that you love, two hobbies that you have.
2:25:39
So I'm going to type mine and you can pause the video, type two short paragraphs
2:25:45
on your own and then you can resume. I chose to go with two of my favorite hobbies and so now you
2:25:56
can see how we can change the view.
2:26:03
We're going to go up to the view menu and I want to cover this menu in its entirety.
2:26:09
However, we'll start at the top and hover over mode.
2:26:15
You can see by default, you're in editing view, the top choice.
2:26:20
That's the default choice. So you're able to edit the document directly.
2:26:26
Another mode is suggesting mode, your edits will become suggestions,
2:26:32
which can be accepted or rejected by the owner of the document. And you'll see that later in this module.
2:26:40
And then viewing mode will allow you to read or print the final document.
2:26:46
So we're in editing mode. We're going to skip suggesting mode for right now.
2:26:52
And click on viewing mode. So it gets rid of the toolbar at the top.
2:26:59
The rulers are gone, stuff like that. And you can go back to view, hover over mode and go back to editing.
2:27:10
It's one way of doing it. Now, the other thing I'll mention here about switching modes.
2:27:16
is you can also do it from the right side of the toolbar.
2:27:23
So there's an icon that has a pencil on it and you can do the drop down
2:27:32
next to it and you can see you're back in editing mode and each
2:27:38
different mode has a different icon. So you can always look over there if you're unsure.
2:27:44
of what mode you might be in. Let's go back to the view menu.
2:27:52
So show print layout. You won't be able to see this right now unless we add a
2:27:58
second page to this document. So let's temporarily do that. I'm going to just click away from the view menu and underneath my last paragraph,
2:28:09
I'm going to hold down my control key. And press enter.
2:28:14
So now, I have two pages. And I'm on the second page.
2:28:21
And you can see the edges of the page.
2:28:26
So that's what print layout looks like. It's actually showing you what the document would
2:28:32
look like if it was printed. Versus this. Let's go back to view and uncheck show print layout, and now you
2:28:43
have what's known as continuous. So I'm seeing the dividing line between the pages, but I'm not
2:28:51
seeing the space between each page.
2:28:57
And I'm going to use my backspace key to get rid of that second page.
2:29:02
So the line disappears. And I'm back to view.
2:29:09
I'm gonna show print layout again and go back to view. So if you don't wanna see the rulers, you can uncheck show ruler.
2:29:18
Show outline. If I uncheck that, that little icon that was on the left disappears, I'm
2:29:28
gonna go back to view and check show outline again, and then collapse it.
2:29:37
You also have an equation toolbar that you can show if you need to do any equations in DOCS.
2:29:44
You have this new equation toolbar that shows up underneath.
2:29:50
Your regular toolbar. I'm going to go back to view and turn that off.
2:29:55
And if you're working with a large document, you might want to break it into sections for a variety of reasons.
2:30:03
And if you need to do so, you can find on the view menu, show section breaks.
2:30:11
Your last option there is full screen. So like I said, we'll circle back around to suggesting mode.
2:30:19
A little later in this module, now we're going to add some images to our documents.
Inserting Images
2:30:30
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to click at the end of the first paragraph and press enter twice.
2:30:39
And then I'm going to go up to the insert menu, hover over image, and you can see your choices.
2:30:45
You can upload from your computer. You can search the web, you can go to images on drive, in photos.
2:30:54
You can do it by URL and you can get images from a camera here as well So we're
2:31:03
gonna do search the web They have some really good Google images that you can use
2:31:10
and it opens on the right side and it's in the search box and for myself because
2:31:18
my first hobby is that I love to garden and I'm going to type in garden and you
2:31:25
can type in something that correlates to whatever your first paragraph is about.
2:31:32
And so when I click on garden in the search results, I get all kinds of images, some of which are like of my dream gardens.
2:31:43
But I'm gonna find an image that I kinda like, select it, and at the bottom
2:31:49
right, click on the blue insert button.
2:31:54
So I have a picture of someone else's garden underneath my first paragraph.
2:32:02
I'm gonna click it underneath my second paragraph, I already had space down there.
2:32:07
And I am going to find an image, another image off of the web,
2:32:15
that correlates to that paragraph. And you can do the same and pause the video while you're doing it.
2:32:24
So my second image created another page.
2:32:29
It didn't fit on the first page. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go up to my first image and I'm
2:32:36
going to just click on it to select it. And so you'll notice on the bottom left corner, there are a series of icons now
2:32:50
and they correspond to how the image works with any text on the screen.
2:32:55
And so if you hover over the first one, which is the default, it's in line with the text.
2:33:02
You could have the text wrap around the image, break the text, behind
2:33:08
the text, or in front of text. We don't need to change that option.
2:33:15
To the right of that you have your image options ellipses. And we're going to select that and choose size and rotation.
2:33:25
So I want to change the size of both images, trying to get both of them to fit on the same page.
2:33:33
If you notice on the right panel, the width is 6. 5 and the height is four inches.
2:33:41
I'm going to change the height. I'm going to just try this. I'm going to change the height to two inches and then I'll see how
2:33:50
it looks when it's three inches. And that might work.
2:33:56
So now I'm going to do the same thing by going down and selecting my second image.
2:34:03
And notice that pane, that panel stays open. And I'm going to change that height to three as well.
2:34:11
And that's enough to get it on the same page.
2:34:18
So we have two paragraphs and two images that cor, correspond to our paragraphs.
2:34:26
I'm going to name my document, my favorite hobbies, and you can name yours whatever
2:34:38
favorite things that you listed, my favorite foods or whatever it may be.
2:34:43
And I'm going to go ahead and close image options panel on the right.
2:34:48
Now we're going to move on to inserting page numbers in our document, and
Page Numbers
2:34:55
I'm going to go to the insert menu. For this as well, and almost toward the bottom, you'll see page numbers, and when
2:35:03
you hover over it, you'll see four icons. Well, the two on the left show the page numbers on both the first
2:35:14
page and any subsequent pages. The top left one is if you have the page numbers in the upper right corner.
2:35:22
And the lower left one is if you have them in the lower right corner.
2:35:27
On the right side, the top one, is when you don't have a page number on the first
2:35:33
page, but you have them on subsequent pages, and it's in the upper right.
2:35:38
And the lower one is the same, but it will be in the lower right.
2:35:44
And then you have more options, and a page count, and we'll work through This menu.
2:35:53
So the first one we're going to do is we'll select the first one on the left hand side of those icons.
2:36:02
And you can see at the top of your document, the header pane is
2:36:08
expanded and you see the page number in the upper right hand corner.
2:36:15
From there, in the header section, you can choose different first page or not, which
2:36:21
means don't put one on the first page. Or put something different on the first page.
2:36:27
And then you have your options drop down where you can format the header, get back to page numbers or remove it.
2:36:34
We're going to choose remove header for now. We're going to go back to insert page numbers.
2:36:42
And this time we're just gonna go directly to more options.
2:36:47
So we're gonna say we want the numbers to be in the footer.
2:36:53
We will show them on the first page. And we're gonna start at number one.
2:37:00
And we'll apply. So it opened the footer panel.
2:37:05
And so, you know, it's the same thing as choosing a preset. But I wanna show you, um, everything that happens here.
2:37:13
on that menu. Now in your footer, after the number one that's down there, you're going to type a
2:37:21
space and the word of and another space.
2:37:28
And we're going to go back to insert page numbers.
2:37:33
And this time at the bottom, we're going to choose page count.
2:37:39
So now it'd be one of one. And when we add another page, it'd be two of two, that type of thing.
2:37:49
And you can just click on any blank space on your document to get out of that footer section.
2:37:55
So we worked with a style earlier in the course, and we're going to
Styles
2:38:01
do so again for a particular reason.
2:38:07
When you apply styles in your document, those styles feed your
2:38:13
outline, your document outline. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to click In front of the
2:38:20
first paragraph, press enter and then my up arrow to get above it.
2:38:29
And I'm going to type the name of my first favorite hobby. So I'm going to just type gardening.
2:38:40
And then I'm going to just select the word gardening and you can double click a word to select it.
2:38:48
And by the way, you can triple click a paragraph to select it.
2:38:53
So I just want the word. And from the toolbar, where it says normal text, that's your style, your
2:39:01
current style, I'm going to do the drop down, and I am going to choose...
2:39:09
heading 2 and you can click directly on it to apply it.
2:39:16
I'm going to click right in front of my second paragraph and repeat
2:39:22
the process and you want the same style for this paragraph.
2:39:28
Now I'm going to use control home to get back to the very top of my document.
2:39:34
I'm going to press enter. And then up arrow.
2:39:39
And I'm gonna just type the same thing that I named my file.
2:39:45
My Favorite Hobbies.
2:39:51
And so, since I put it above Gardening, it has the Heading 2 style applied to it.
2:39:58
But I want it to be a different style. So, I'm gonna just go to my Style dropdown.
2:40:04
And for this one, I'll choose title.
2:40:09
Now that we have our styles in our document, we can view our
Document Outlines
2:40:15
document outline over on the left. So you'll notice that all of your styles.
2:40:23
are what make up your outline. Outlines are really helpful when you're working with a large
2:40:30
document because you can use it to navigate to different sections of
2:40:35
the document based on your styles. So if I click on music, It takes me to that section of my document.
2:40:43
And I notice my picture dropped down to a second page because of my heading again.
2:40:48
If I click on gardening, it takes me there. And then My Favorite Hobbies is at the top.
2:40:55
Now, I may not want this, the title of the document.
2:41:01
in my outline. So, if I want to, I can use the X to the right of my favorite hobbies
2:41:09
and remove it from the outline. And conversely, if I wanted to re add it to the outline, I could just
2:41:18
right click anywhere within it, And choose Add to Document Outline.
2:41:24
And it puts it back in its same position. And this is where you can also put in a summary of your document.
2:41:32
A brief description if you will. I'm gonna click the plus sign to add a summary.
2:41:39
And I'm gonna say, This is a list of my favorite hobbies.
2:41:49
Something like that. And I can click away from it and it lets you know that the summary is saved.
2:41:58
Now I can collapse that panel on the left again until I need it.
2:42:03
So I said we would get to working with suggesting mode.
Collaboration and Suggesting Mode
2:42:09
Later in this module. So remember your modes button is right under your share button on the toolbar
2:42:16
But I'm not gonna put this document in Suggesting mode at this time.
2:42:23
I want to really be able to demonstrate this feature So the first thing I want to
2:42:28
do is I want to share this document with my alter ego So, I'm gonna give alter ego
2:42:40
editor permissions, but just so you know, if I give them commenter permissions,
2:42:49
then when they open the document, it will already be in suggesting mode.
2:42:56
But I'm gonna leave it on editor. And I'm going to just send, I'm not even going to notify.
2:43:02
I'm just going to send or share.
2:43:07
So now I'm going to switch over to my alter ego account. I'm going to leave this account.
2:43:13
Open and this document open in this account. I am going to actually scroll to the second page where my picture ended again.
2:43:24
And then I'm going to switch over to my other account. And in my alter ego account, I can see I'm still in my drive shared with me area.
2:43:36
And that document pops up. So I'm gonna just open that document by double clicking it.
2:43:50
So it lets me know who I'm currently signed in as. I'm gonna click okay, I'm in as alter.
2:43:57
I am going to collapse the outline on the left.
2:44:03
And what I'm gonna do is I am going to go up to my mode icon on the
2:44:10
toolbar and change it to suggesting.
2:44:16
So I'm gonna scroll down. In the document, and what I want to do is I want to make sure both of
2:44:27
these pictures fit on the same page. So I'm going to select the first one, and I'm going to go to its image
2:44:36
options button, size and rotation, and I'm going to make the height 2.
2:44:44
5. And I'm going to go down to the second image and do the same, and see
2:44:51
if that places it on the same page. Yes, it does. So I have one page for that.
2:44:59
Now close image options panel for a moment and you can see
2:45:05
what I've done here, right? So I don't want to accept this suggestion because I'm not the owner of this
2:45:16
document and that would be the check mark. So every time I make a change, I'll see a box like this.
2:45:23
What I want to do. is let Trish know that I've made an edit.
2:45:30
So I'm gonna use the at symbol there, and it brings up Trish,
2:45:36
and that's mentioning that person. And this is where it gets a little confusing.
2:45:43
It's really, to me, it should be a send button, but it's reply that I have to...
2:45:50
And then I'm gonna go down to the next click on it, and
2:45:56
I'm gonna do the same thing. I'm gonna mention...
2:46:01
Trish and choose reply.
2:46:08
And now the other thing I'm going to do. Is I'm going to click after that second picture and press enter.
2:46:18
So it gives me a new page and a new opportunity to type something else.
2:46:26
So what I'm going to do here, I'm going to make believe that alter. is Trish's assistant and Trish has asked her to type up the
2:46:35
information about Trish's third hobby. And so I'm going to do that. You, you're going to add another hobby or food or whatever your favorite thing was,
2:46:44
another paragraph and a supporting image. And then you can resume the video.
2:46:51
So on my end, I gave it my Heading 2 style for reading, typed a
2:46:59
paragraph, and then inserted a picture which I changed the size of.
2:47:05
I mentioned Trish for everything that I did.
2:47:10
Now these are just suggestions, and they show in Alter's document.
2:47:17
But I'm going to switch back over to Trish. And when I do, it's automatically showing me all of Alter's information.
2:47:30
And this is where I, as the owner, can say that I want, I can
2:47:36
accept or reject these changes.
2:47:41
And so, I'm gonna go down, and I'm gonna just do the check marks for everything,
2:47:48
to accept the suggestions, rather. And now, in my version of the document, It's the same as the suggestions, what
2:48:01
I had originally and the suggestions that alter made using suggesting mode.
2:48:08
Pretty cool. So something else I want to show you here. If you look up in the upper right hand corner, you'll see I'm in as Trish.
Comments
2:48:18
I have a blue number one up there and when I hover over it, it says open comment history.
2:48:26
So when I do that, I can see all the suggesting comments
2:48:31
that I received from alter ego. I can go to it's more options button and get a link to this comment is
2:48:40
basically what I could do there. And so if I hadn't gone through.
2:48:48
And done the check marks, all of these would still be considered open, right?
2:48:55
When I was paused, I did a suggestion and it, I messed it up so I rejected it.
2:49:02
But, everything else is saying that the suggestion was accepted. That alter did now up at the top is a drop down next to all so if I had any
2:49:14
open things that I haven't reviewed to accept, they would show under open.
2:49:22
I'm going to just go back to all. Now there's a couple of ways that you can use comments
2:49:28
other than in suggesting mode. I'm going to click away from that. The way that I normally use to start a comment, you'll notice if you put your
2:49:38
mouse on the right border of your page. As you move it up and down, you'll see the same three icons.
2:49:47
The top one is to add a comment. The second one is to add an emoji reaction.
2:49:53
And the third one puts you in suggesting mode, right?
2:49:58
So, I'm gonna be as close to this picture of a garden as I can be.
2:50:03
And I'm gonna do the plus sign next to add comment.
2:50:08
So I can have a comment for myself. I can add others to comments, right, by using the mention,
2:50:17
the at symbol to mention them. Right. I'm going to just do a comment to myself and it's going to be try to find a
2:50:27
garden pick that looks more like mine.
2:50:36
And I'm going to choose comment. So that's there for me to see.
2:50:43
If I hover over its check mark, it says mark as resolved and hide this discussion.
2:50:52
If I go to it's more options, I can edit it, delete it, or
2:50:58
get a link to this comment. I'm going to choose edit
2:51:06
and I'm going to click at the beginning of the comment. And I'm going to mention Alter Ego.
2:51:14
And I'm going to change my sentence and say, Would you please try to find a
2:51:22
garden pick that looks more like mine? And I'm going to choose Save.
2:51:31
So I switch back over to Alter Ego. And you can see the comment because I was mentioned in it.
2:51:38
And, Would you please try to find a garden pick, blah, blah, blah. And I'm going to click on that comment and reply.
2:51:46
Well actually I'm going to use one of the presets underneath. Will do. And then I'll put by Tuesday.
2:51:55
And reply. And so I look up and I see my notification that I have a new comment.
2:52:04
I go to open my comment history. Now I can see it on the screen there quite well as well.
2:52:11
I can open it in comment history as well. And so for these types of comments, I have the ability to edit,
2:52:20
delete, resolve, or get a link. The ones that were suggestions, I just get resolved and get a link to this comment.
2:52:32
But a good way of communicating back and forth, With a document so alter
2:52:37
says that she'll find this picture and get it done by Tuesday Tuesday she'll find a picture and go into suggesting mode and then I'll get that Notification
2:52:49
and accept or reject whatever photo she chooses In this module, we got a
Google Docs Recap
2:52:57
better understanding of Google Docs. We started by reviewing its display screen.
2:53:04
We typed a couple of paragraphs and then we went through the different views that you have in a document.
2:53:12
We learned how to insert images and resize them.
2:53:18
We moved on to inserting page numbers and customizing them.
2:53:23
And then we worked. With styles, which we then saw populated our document outline, which can be
2:53:32
used in long documents for navigational purposes or even shorter documents.
2:53:39
And then we moved on to collaborating with suggesting mode. You saw that from both sides of the equation.
2:53:46
We shared the document. Went to the other user, they went into suggesting mode, made some changes,
2:53:54
which were accepted by the owner. And we ended up working with comments.
2:54:01
In Module 6, we'll explore Google Slides over 9 lessons.
Introduction to Google Slides
2:54:07
We'll start as usual by understanding its display screen, learning how to
2:54:12
change the view of a presentation, we'll enter text in a slide, add an image
2:54:19
to a slide, and then you'll learn how to add, delete, and reorder slides.
2:54:26
We'll make our presentation more visually appealing by applying a theme in Lesson 6.
2:54:32
And we'll increase audience engagement in Lesson 7 by adding transitions and animations.
2:54:40
In Lesson 8, we'll focus on delivering a presentation, and we'll end by using
2:54:46
presenter view and audience tools. If I'm working in Google Docs, and I want to go to Google Slides, I
2:54:56
can just go to Docs Home, and that's where you'll see the apps menu.
2:55:05
in the upper right. So I'm going to use the apps menu and this time we're going to select slides.
2:55:12
We're going to select the blank presentation template.
2:55:20
Just like docs and sheets, we have our untitled presentation
2:55:26
in the upper left corner. Our rename box.
2:55:31
We can star this if we wanted to show in the star area of Drive.
2:55:38
And that's, you star things that are important to you.
2:55:43
It does have a menu bar, although some of the options are a little bit different
2:55:48
here, like you have a slide menu. And it has a toolbar, which is somewhat different from
2:55:58
what you've seen previously. All of these things adjust, the menu bar and the toolbars adjust
2:56:05
depending on the application. The upper right side of the screen, you still have your arrow that says
2:56:16
this new file has not been saved yet. You have your comment history.
2:56:22
Google meet and then here you have slideshow you can start a slideshow
2:56:28
right from here or from the menu you have sharing your account as usual and then
2:56:36
you have that sidebar with some other apps and I'm going to go to the bottom of that and collapse that panel on the right side When you go into a blank template,
2:56:49
it gives you a themes panel on the right, and we're going to close that for now,
2:56:55
just to gain some more working space. Similar to Docs, you have a ruler at the top and at the left side.
2:57:06
This area in the middle of the screen is where you create your...
2:57:11
slides, and you fill them in. And on the left side, you have what's known as filmstrip view.
2:57:20
And you'll see how to use that as we go along.
2:57:26
At the bottom of the filmstrip panel, you'll see a couple of icons.
2:57:32
The first one, and you'll notice it has a horizontal black line going across the top of it.
2:57:39
And that's When you hover over it, it says filmstrip view. The other icon is grid view.
2:57:46
You can go ahead and click on that and it takes you to a different view.
2:57:52
Let's go back to filmstrip view. We'll use grid view. Later in this module right underneath your slide template You have an area
2:58:05
that says click to add speaker notes When you're doing a presentation, which you'll
2:58:12
learn how to deliver a presentation later in this module You would be able to see
2:58:17
speaker notes In what is called Presenter View, your audience won't see them.
2:58:24
So you can use speaker notes to have reminders of what you'd like to say while a particular slide is on the screen, or other information.
2:58:35
If I want to hide the filmstrip, I can use that left pointing arrow at the bottom.
2:58:43
And that gains me more working space, and then I can show it again, and I'm going to leave that showing.
2:58:51
Now we're going to start entering text in slides. So, when you bring up a new blank presentation, it gives you a slide
Entering Text
2:59:03
with a layout known as a title slide. So, it says click to add title, and click to add subtitle.
2:59:11
We're going to click where it says click to add title. And we're going to type workspace collaboration.
2:59:22
And then we'll click where it says, click to add subtitle.
2:59:28
And I'm going to type presented by colon. And then my name.
2:59:37
for, and then learn it. And then I can click away from that.
2:59:43
And so I have a slide, one slide in a presentation at this point.
2:59:52
Now we want another slide. So I'm going to go to the slide menu and choose new slide.
3:00:00
And you see the shortcut key for that is control M. I'm going to just click on new slide and this time it gives you a layout that's
3:00:10
different than the one we just saw. This is called a title and body layout.
3:00:16
So when you use control M or new slide, that's the layout you're going to get.
3:00:24
And it will work for us in this example. So I'm going to click where it says, click to add title.
3:00:32
And the title is going to be modules. 1 4 Topics.
3:00:40
And notice the title on this type of a layout is in smaller font than the previous one.
3:00:49
On the second box, where it says click to add text, I'm gonna click there.
3:00:55
And this is the body portion of the layout.
3:01:00
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go up to the toolbar, and I'm
3:01:06
going to select the numbered list.
3:01:11
So it gives me the number one, and I'm going to type, Using Google Drive.
3:01:20
Press enter, you'll get the number two. Collaborating.
3:01:26
And notice it gives me a suggestion, collaborating with. Well, I don't want with, but I'm going to press tab anyway to select that.
3:01:36
And it's going to be collaborating in Google drive, enter,
3:01:43
working with common features.
3:01:50
And the last one is using Google sheets.
3:01:55
And these are the topics for this particular course. Now at this point, we want another slide.
3:02:03
with the same exact layout as our current slide, and also with a
3:02:08
numbered list on the bottom portion. So, instead of using new slide, what you can do, and what I usually do,
3:02:19
is in the film strip on the left, I'm gonna right click on slide 2,
3:02:26
and I'm gonna choose Duplicate Slide. So now I'm on slide 3, which is exactly like slide 2.
3:02:35
On slide 3, I'm gonna change the title, so from Modules 1
3:02:41
through 4, it's going to be 5,
3:02:49
And then for the numbered list, for the first item, do CTRL A to
3:02:54
select everything that's in there. and press delete on your keyboard.
3:02:59
Now it leaves you with the number one. We want these numbers to be five through eight.
3:03:06
So we're going to fix that first and then we'll put in the other four topics.
3:03:12
And we're going to do that by going to the format menu, hover over
3:03:18
bullets and numbering, hover over list options and choose restart numbering.
3:03:27
And we're going to type in the number five. And press Enter or click OK.
3:03:35
So now we're ready to type the topic for Module 5, which is using Google Docs.
3:03:46
And 6 is going to be using Google Slides.
3:03:51
So you can see where we are in the overall course. We have using Google Forms.
3:04:02
And last but not least, using Google Meet.
3:04:09
And you can click anywhere outside of that box. If you click on a blank area of the slide, then nothing is selected.
3:04:19
Let's talk about changing the view of a presentation now. So, Slideshow is a view, and you know you have your Slideshow
Changing Presentation Views
3:04:28
button in the upper right corner. And if you click directly on the button, It will load the slideshow and
3:04:37
it will display the slide that you're currently on in your presentation.
3:04:42
You can press escape to get out of the slideshow. If we want to start the slideshow from the first slide, we can go to
3:04:53
the slideshow dropdown arrow and choose start from beginning, and it
3:04:59
gives you the shortcut key combination for that control shift F five.
3:05:05
So when I click on that, it will load it. With the first slide, and it's set so that every time I click,
3:05:13
it will display the next slide. When I'm on the last one, I can just press escape to exit the slideshow.
3:05:26
And now let's go to the view menu, see what options we have there.
3:05:32
Well you have your slideshow on there, and that shortcut key is for start to show whatever slide you're on.
3:05:40
Motion and Theme Builder, we will circle around to later in this module.
3:05:48
Grid View, and you see that it's on the View menu. Also, you have that icon below your filmstrip.
3:05:58
And let's go ahead and select Grid View. Grid View is another way of looking at your slide presentation.
3:06:07
So you're seeing kind of like all of the little mini slides.
3:06:12
on the same screen at the same time. This is a good view and we'll use it later.
3:06:17
It's a really good view for reordering slides. And if I want to get out of this view, I'm going to use the film strip
3:06:26
icon in the lower left hand corner to go back to the default view.
3:06:34
Let's go back to the view menu. If you don't want to see the rulers, you can uncheck show ruler.
3:06:43
If you hover over guides on the right side, you can select show guides.
3:06:49
And so it kind of segments your slide.
3:06:55
So if you were going to add more content, it gives you a framework or a structure to work in.
3:07:02
Let's go back to view. And then you have snap to.
3:07:07
When you're placing items on a slide, it will kind of, when you're
3:07:12
near a guide in this case, It will kind of make it snap to that area.
3:07:20
You'll feel a little tug and it just kind of takes it where it needs to be in that area.
3:07:25
The reason why we're seeing speaker notes at the bottom is for this next option.
3:07:31
It's showing the film strip and if we have any comments they would show as well.
3:07:38
And then you have the ability to zoom and the ability to view it in full screen.
3:07:46
And you can select full screen. So everything is hidden except the slide that you're on.
3:07:54
And it tells you at the top that you can press escape to go back to your regular view.
3:08:03
And then go ahead and click on your first slide. We're going to add an image to this slide.
Adding Images
3:08:10
And we're going to use the Learn It logo that we've already uploaded to Google Drive.
3:08:17
We're going to go to the insert menu. Hover over image and choose drive
3:08:28
and the only image I have in drive I believe is that learn it logo and that's
3:08:34
the image that I want to use so there's a couple of different ways that I can
3:08:41
get this image on to the slide and Which way you choose depends on what happens
3:08:47
next now the first way I'm going to show you is the way I would do it if I had
3:08:53
multiple images in my drive that I wanted to add somewhere in this presentation.
3:08:59
And that would be if I click and hold on the LearnIt logo and
3:09:06
drag it and drop it in the lower left hand corner of the slide.
3:09:11
When I use drag and drop, The panel on the right stays open.
3:09:19
And so I'm going to do control Z to undo that. And I'll show you the second way this way.
3:09:26
I'm going to click on it. And at the bottom, I'm going to choose insert.
3:09:33
And it inserts it, and it closes the panel.
3:09:39
And then I'm going to move it, so it's all the way in the lower left hand corner.
3:09:44
And I just put my mouse on the border of it so it has the four headed arrow. We're gonna be adding more images to different slides a
3:09:52
little later in this module. Before we start adding, deleting, and reordering slides, Let's go
Adding Slides
3:10:01
back to our view menu, hover over guides, and uncheck show guides.
3:10:09
So now, we are going to, in the film strip on the left, We're going to right click
3:10:16
on the first slide, choose new slide, and then right click on the new slide,
3:10:26
hover over apply layout, and we would like the section header layout here.
3:10:34
So it just gives you a title box that you can use as a section header.
3:10:41
Describing the upcoming section or something like that and where it says
3:10:46
click to add title We're gonna just type modules 1 dash 4 now we want
3:10:57
to insert some images And I'm gonna for some reason I have the format
3:11:03
options pane open on the right. I'm gonna close that We're gonna insert two images on this slide.
3:11:11
We want the logo for Google Drive as well as the logo for Google Sheets.
3:11:20
Those are the two applications that we really focused on
3:11:26
in modules one through four. And so from the insert menu, just like we did with the Learn It
3:11:34
logo, we're going to hover over image and this time search the web.
3:11:40
I'm going to type in the search box Google Drive Logo.
3:11:50
And then select the first one on the list. And I'm going to select the first one that shows up and choose Insert.
3:12:01
I'm going to click on a blank area of the slide. Go back to Insert Image.
3:12:07
Search the web. And this time I can just double click the word Drive.
3:12:14
And type Sheets. So, the Google Sheets logo.
3:12:19
And I'm gonna grab the first one. And insert.
3:12:26
Now, I would want both logos to be the same size. And I like the size of the one.
3:12:32
for Drive. So I'm going to first right click on the Drive logo, go to Format Options, and
3:12:41
you can see the width and the height, 2. 02 inches for both for me.
3:12:49
I'm going to click on the Google Sheets logo, and change
3:12:54
its width and height to 2. 02.
3:13:02
And then I'm going to put my mouse in the center of it so I get the four headed arrow, and I'm going to just drag it down to the lower right corner.
3:13:12
And you'll see the guides that start showing up as I'm dragging it, like that horizontal red line is showing me that they're now aligned by their centers.
3:13:29
And they're different shapes, so I'm kind of wanting them to be aligned by their bottoms.
3:13:36
I'm going to drag the Google Drive One down all the way to the bottom
3:13:44
and then I'm gonna hold down my ctrl key and click on the Google Sheets Icon, and so now they're both selected and I can go to the arrange menu
3:13:58
Hover over a line and choose bottom.
3:14:03
So they're different shaped Logos, but they're now aligned by their
3:14:09
bottoms And then we're going to make a duplicate of this slide, and we're
3:14:17
going to change the title to 5 8.
3:14:27
And I'm going to show you another way of selecting multiple icons.
3:14:33
So notice where my mouse pointer is. It's slightly above and to the left of the drive icon, and it's pointing.
3:14:42
to the left. I'm going to click and hold and I'm going to drag and draw a box around both icons
3:14:52
and now they're both selected and I'm going to press delete on my keyboard.
3:14:59
So this slide is going to end up having four different icons on it.
3:15:05
We'll do the first two together and then you can do the last two on your own.
3:15:12
So we want to grab the logo for Docs. First, I'm gonna just go back to insert image, search the web, change
3:15:23
sheets in the search box to docs,
3:15:32
and I'm gonna grab the first docs logo and insert it.
3:15:40
I'm going to immediately right click on it, go to format options,
3:15:46
and change its width and height to the same as the previous ones. In my case, it was 2.
3:15:53
02 for both measurements.
3:15:59
And I'm going to go ahead and drag that icon all the way down into the lower left corner.
3:16:05
Click on a blank area of your slide, insert image web.
3:16:13
We're going to change docs to slides here and grab the first slides logo, insert it.
3:16:27
And I'll let you go ahead and change its size on your own to match the size of the previous one.
3:16:36
And when you have the size, right, just drag it down to the right. of your docs logo.
3:16:44
So you have two more to insert in size.
3:16:50
And that would be Forms and then Meet. And so once you do Forms and Meet, go ahead and pause the video and
3:16:58
get those logos in and sized. Then you can unpause and resume.
3:17:06
So don't worry about the spacing or the alignment right now of these icons.
3:17:11
We're gonna address that momentarily. We should go ahead and rename the file from Untitled.
3:17:19
When I click in there, Workspace Collaboration is great. As a name so just want to make sure we do that and then i'm going to Draw a
Deleting Slides
3:17:32
box around all four of those Logos, and I'm going to go to the Arrange menu.
3:17:41
And the first thing I'm going to do is hover over a line and choose Bottom.
3:17:48
Go back to Arrange, and I'm going to hover over Distribute and choose Horizontally.
3:17:59
So you see, it gave it equal spacing between each icon.
3:18:07
And now, let's duplicate that slide that you're on. And then we say, oh my goodness, I did that totally by accident.
3:18:17
I don't really need that slide. So, in your filmstrip, you can right click on the duplicated
3:18:24
slide, and you can choose Delete.
3:18:30
You could also select the slide and press Delete on your keyboard to have the same.
3:18:37
And if you delete a slide by accident, You can undo the deletion.
3:18:44
I'm gonna switch to grid view, and I'm gonna use the handy little icon
Reordering Slides
3:18:51
underneath the filmstrip to do so. Now, you can do it in filmstrip view as well, but I'm in the habit of when I have
3:19:02
to reorder slides, of using this view. I feel like I can see more of the slide thumbnails in this view.
3:19:11
And so what I'm going to do is, We want that module 5 through 8
3:19:17
section header with the icons on it to be in between slides 4 and 5.
3:19:26
And so I'm going to click and hold on it. And I'm going to drag it down, and as I drag it around, you'll see a guideline.
3:19:34
And when that guideline, that vertical guideline is between slides 4 and 5, I'm going to let go.
3:19:43
So the section header is in the appropriate place in this presentation now.
3:19:50
And I can use the button on the lower left to go back to Filmstrip. And like I said, you can do the same thing, move things around.
3:20:00
In this view, however, let's say you have a slide presentation with 20
3:20:08
slides or 15 slides, you're not going to see all of them here, whereas you'll
3:20:13
be able to see more in grid view, but this is just a personal preference.
3:20:19
It is not a requirement. Of the application by any means to give our presentation more visual appeal.
Themes
3:20:30
We're going to apply a theme to it and we're going to do that from the slide menu and down at the bottom.
3:20:40
We're going to choose change theme and so the themes panel opens on the right side.
3:20:48
And there are you notice at the top. It says in this presentation, right?
3:20:55
I can expand that. So these are themes that are available, different colorations, different fonts,
3:21:03
in some cases, even different font colors. And so these are built-in themes that you can use.
3:21:11
Now, some themes behave in different ways.
3:21:18
And it depends on the slide layout, as you'll see.
3:21:23
And so, what I'm going to do, on the right side in themes, I'm gonna just...
3:21:29
Select this theme here. It's called paradigm, and I'm just going to select it by clicking on it now.
3:21:37
Notice it applied that theme. It's slightly different on a title slide, right?
3:21:45
Um, it looks even different on the section header slides with those layouts
3:21:53
and then the title and body slides. If you click on slide three over there, you can see how it made this kind
3:22:02
of into two columns and it put the design in the title on the left side.
3:22:08
So that's an example of a theme. I'll go back to slide one.
3:22:14
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to choose a different theme. I'm going to choose this one.
3:22:20
It's the orange one. It's called Swiss.
3:22:25
And so, this one you can see how it looks on the title slide.
3:22:30
How it looks on the section header slides. And then it didn't really, it applied some of the graphics, the lines.
3:22:42
To our title and body slide layouts and we can almost live with that.
3:22:50
However, we would like to have some color on those slides to do that.
3:22:57
We're going to go back to the slide menu and almost at the bottom. This time we're going to choose edit theme and you get this whole.
3:23:09
Different view and at the top of it, it says editing Swiss, that's
3:23:15
the name of the theme, right? And it's showing you here that the title and body layout is used on two slides.
3:23:27
Because I was on that slide when I came in here, it's on that layout on the left.
3:23:34
So you see we have the coloration for these two layouts, but not for this
3:23:40
one that's selected on this left pane. And we want to give it some coloration.
3:23:46
And so, there's a little toolbar, and it has background
3:23:53
and colors at the end of it. We're going to choose background.
3:23:59
And we're gonna do the color drop down. And I don't want it to be the exact same color, but I want it
3:24:07
to be like a pale orange y color. And I don't like that one, so I'm gonna try this one.
3:24:17
I'm actually gonna do custom, and then that way, I can kinda mix the
3:24:24
color a little bit better here. It's gonna be more brown y than orange.
3:24:31
And I'm going to choose okay. I could use an image in the background or I can reset it to the theme from here.
3:24:40
I'm going to do done and I'm comfortable with that contrast. So if you look at your film strip, you'll see that those two
3:24:49
slides, the title and body slides. Now have that color
3:24:57
and so I can close this middle panel where we're editing By using its X and
3:25:07
now I'm back in my presentation and to be honest with you I'll probably
3:25:12
go and change that color I'm looking at it now and I don't like it.
3:25:18
And so I did change it. So the color is consistent Really when you're thinking about a
3:25:24
presentation Less is more And you'll see that in upcoming lessons.
3:25:33
Transitions are effects that the audience will see when you advance from one
3:25:40
slide to another during a presentation.
3:25:46
Animations, on the other hand, happen on the slide.
3:25:52
We're gonna start with transitions. So typically, I will use one transition The same exact transition for all
3:26:02
of the slides in my presentation, just to keep it very spare.
3:26:08
Also, it helps to keep the audience's attention.
3:26:13
Imagine you had 50 slides and you used different transitions between them, or a
3:26:20
mix of different transitions between them. At some point, your audience is going to start thinking, I wonder
3:26:28
what cool thing is going to happen. when he or she advances to the next slide instead of paying attention
3:26:36
to the content of your presentation. So I'm just going to use one transition for all slides.
3:26:43
And we're going to do that by right clicking on the first slide in the filmstrip and choosing transition.
3:26:51
And that opens the motion panel on the right. So you notice it says there are no transitions.
3:27:02
We're going to do the drop down arrow next to none. And we'll go through a few of these.
3:27:08
And we'll choose dissolve. Right underneath that, you will see the speed of the transition, and then you have
3:27:18
a button that says, Apply to all slides. And if you look over in your filmstrip, to the left of each slide thumbnail, you'll
3:27:30
see the motion icon indicating That that slide has a transition applied to it.
3:27:38
Now what we can do, I'm going to just go up and click on the slideshow button.
3:27:45
And now when I click or press enter to advance to the next slide, you'll see that the previous slide had the dissolve effect.
3:27:58
When I click again, you'll see the same effect.
3:28:03
And I'm gonna just press escape to exit the slideshow, and
3:28:09
click back on the first slide. Let's test a few more transitions.
3:28:16
So on the right side, I'm gonna do the dropdown next to dissolve, and let's look at cube.
3:28:26
And again, you're gonna apply to all slides, and then click your slideshow button.
3:28:34
Go ahead and click, and you can see the cube effect.
3:28:42
Let's press escape, click on the first slide, and we'll try one more.
3:28:48
I'm gonna go to the dropdown and select gallery, apply that one to
3:28:53
all slides, and play my slideshow.
3:29:04
And I think I like the gallery effect. So I'm going to press escape, click on the first slide, and we have our transitions.
3:29:15
So now we're going to switch our focus to animations.
3:29:22
We're going to add animations to the second and fourth slides.
3:29:27
So I'm going to go to the second slide, and what I want to do is...
3:29:34
I want to select both of those logos on the bottom, and this
3:29:42
is where we can make a decision. I'm making the decision to animate both of these logos at the same time.
3:29:50
You could do them one at a time, and I'll show you that example when we get to slide four.
3:29:57
On the right side, we're still using the same motion panel that we use for transitions, and we're going to choose, under object animations,
3:30:12
So, you'll notice the two separate animations, even though we
3:30:18
grouped them together, the first one will happen when we click.
3:30:24
So if we click to advance the slide, and then we click again,
3:30:29
the drive icon will fade in.
3:30:35
So will the sheets icon because it's set to fade in and it's going
3:30:42
to fade in with the previous one. So they'll fade in together is what that is saying.
3:30:49
Now for the first one, the drive fade in.
3:30:54
I'm going to do the drop down next to fade in after I expand it and
3:31:01
you can see the other animation effects that are available.
3:31:10
So I tend to use no more than two object animations and in a situation where I'm
3:31:18
only doing the animations on two slides, I prefer to use the same animation and
3:31:26
so it's not distracting to the audience. So, it defaults to fade in, and I am going to select appear.
3:31:42
And so the first one, the drive one, will appear when you click on the
3:31:47
slide after the slide has advanced. And then the second one is still with previous, and we're going
3:31:55
to leave that one on click. Your other choice there is after previous or with previous.
3:32:03
So we're going to leave that one on on click. And for our sheets icon, I'm going to expand it and I'm
3:32:11
going to change it to appear. And I'm going to leave it set with previous.
3:32:17
I'm gonna go to the first slide first and then click on slideshow.
3:32:23
And so when I click on this one, it has that gallery transition.
3:32:30
And now I'm on the second slide. When I click on this slide, both of those icons appear, and we can escape.
3:32:43
And let's go to slide 4. So since we applied a style, our icons are a little bit too big.
3:32:52
And we'll go back to slide 2. I'll have you do that on your own after we... do it on this slide and apply the animations.
3:33:01
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to move this title box up a little bit.
3:33:07
And by the way, when you have an object selected, you can use your arrow keys on
3:33:12
your keyboard to move that object around. And since I moved it away, I am going to then select these
3:33:23
four icons at the bottom. I'm going to right click on any one of them and choose format options.
3:33:36
So I want to change the height of these because I have them all selected. It's saying the width is 10, but I would like the height to be like 1.
3:33:47
5. Oh, well I'm going to deselect it first and look.
3:33:53
I wanted to make sure that each of them were above that white line that's part of the theme.
3:34:01
I'm going to click on the title again, click on the edge of it, use my down arrow to move it back down.
3:34:12
So now that we have the smaller icons, we are going to still select All of them.
3:34:25
Close the Format Options pane on the right. And your Motion Panel is still open.
3:34:32
And so we, just like on slide 2, we're selecting all of these
3:34:38
objects that we want to animate. We're going to click on Add Animation.
3:34:45
And this is where we can separate them. So, I'm gonna use the same animation for each one.
3:34:54
So, for the first one, which is Docs, I'm gonna expand it.
3:35:02
The animation type for this one, I'll try...
3:35:10
Let's see. Fly in from bottom.
3:35:20
And I'd like to do that one on a click. For the next one,
3:35:29
Which is slides. We're gonna change it to fly in from bottom.
3:35:39
And instead of with previous, we're gonna say on click.
3:35:45
So until you click, the next icon won't show. So they'll be treated as individual animations.
3:35:54
Go ahead and choose the same animation and the same method.
3:35:59
of animation for the remaining two icons.
3:36:06
And let's click on slide 3 and start our slideshow.
3:36:13
So go ahead and click to advance. When you click the first time, you'll get the docks icon, click again,
3:36:25
you get slides, again, and you're getting forms, again, and you get
3:36:36
meat, and when you click again, it will advance to the next slide.
3:36:42
And you can press escape. And you can also close.
3:36:49
The motion panel. Let's go to our first slide and at the bottom We're going to click where it
Presenting with Speaker Notes
3:37:01
says click to add speaker notes Now if you put your mouse in the middle of
3:37:07
that panel right above there you'll see three dots you can actually increase
3:37:15
the size of that area and decrease the size of your slide Depends on
3:37:21
how many notes you want to type in. We're not going to type in very many.
3:37:27
So on this one, I'm going to type, Introduce yourself.
3:37:35
Remember, the audience doesn't see speaker notes.
3:37:41
And remember to cover housekeeping issues.
3:37:48
And in parentheses, I'll put, Restrooms, phones, silent.
3:37:56
Et cetera. And so this is a note to the presenter.
3:38:05
Just a reminder of something that you want to discuss or, you know, certain topics that you might want to delve into for a slide.
3:38:14
So you don't have to have a piece of paper. And you'll see how this works.
3:38:19
Now you already know how to deliver a presentation, right? Why don't we go ahead and run through our entire slideshow.
3:38:31
So, we're not seeing our speaker's notes. This would be the screen that your audience would be seeing.
3:38:40
And then I'm gonna click. And I've got my nice transition there.
3:38:45
I'm gonna click again, and on this slide, we have both logos coming up
3:38:52
at the same time, based on one click.
3:38:58
And we have to go back and resize those. Then I click again, and I advance, again.
3:39:06
And then on this slide, when I click, Each icon will show individually,
3:39:15
and then I advance again, and I'm at the end of the slideshow, so
3:39:20
I can go ahead and press escape.
3:39:26
Now, I've already gone to slide 2. And resized my icons.
Presenter View and Audience Tools
3:39:33
Gonna move my Excel icon over a little bit. So, I gave them the height of 1.
3:39:42
50. And you can do the same. And now we're gonna start using Presenter View and Audience Tools.
3:39:50
So once you get your icons adjusted, I'm gonna go to the first slide.
3:39:57
And I'm gonna do the drop down arrow to the right of the slideshow icon.
3:40:04
And at the top of the list is presenter view. So let's go there.
3:40:12
So this window, if you're working, you have a A monitor, or a flat
3:40:19
screen, or you're projecting the actual slideshow, which is here,
3:40:25
behind this screen, for the audience, this can be on your other monitor.
3:40:33
And this way, this is the presenter view window. And so, On the left, it shows you how much time has elapsed
3:40:44
since you started the slideshow. It lets you know that you're on the first slide, and it has a
3:40:50
thumbnail of the first slide. Underneath that, it's showing you a thumbnail of the next slide.
3:40:59
And again, your audience will never see this. On the right side, you have two tabs.
3:41:06
You're on the Speaker Notes tab. We put a Speaker Note on Slide 1.
3:41:14
And you can see the note there. And you can use the plus sign to zoom in to make your note enlarged so
3:41:22
you can view it better if necessary. We didn't put notes on any of the other slides.
3:41:30
But this is how you can see them and not the audience members.
3:41:36
So what I can do when I'm in presenter view, when I'm ready to advance, I can choose next.
3:41:47
And you're seeing in the background, it's showing the slide
3:41:54
without the animations on it. But on presenter view, it's showing each animation and it's saying next, right?
3:42:04
So if I click on that, then you'll see both icons on the slide for the audience.
3:42:14
And now it's showing me the third slide. So I'm going to click next here.
3:42:20
And you're seeing the transition effect that we use.
3:42:27
And I'm going to continue to click next. And so this one, when I do next, I get the docs icon, then I get slides,
3:42:37
then I get forms, and then I get meat.
3:42:43
and next. And now I'm on the last slide.
3:42:49
So I can, at this point, let's go to the audience tools tab, and
3:42:59
I'm going to use this list here to navigate back to slide one.
3:43:06
Audience tools allows you To enable audience Q& A and it's
3:43:13
kind of cool how it works. So you may have just a start new button on the right.
3:43:19
I'm going to click on start new and it tells me that it's accepting questions from within my organization.
3:43:29
And I can do the drop down there and change it to anyone. It has a link there that the audience will see.
3:43:41
At the top of every slide, and it's an active link, so anyone who is viewing
3:43:47
this presentation, in my case, from within my organization, will be able to
3:43:53
ask a question by clicking that link. So I accidentally closed my presenter view window, so I'm going to go
3:44:02
back to my slideshow drop down. And go back into Presenter View.
3:44:09
And I'm going to go back to the Audience Tools tab. So this is when I can continue the recent one.
3:44:18
And it comes up and I can just click on Continue. And you'll see it places the link at the top of every slide.
3:44:27
So anybody within my organization can use the link. And I'm going to do this By just dragging this down, this window down a
3:44:40
little bit, and I'm going to click that active link at the top of the slide.
3:44:49
So, what I can do here, is I can just click on my account.
3:44:55
and sign in as my alter ego and ask a question.
3:45:04
So when I'm asking a question, I have the opportunity to ask anonymously or not.
3:45:11
I'm going to leave it unchecked and I'm going to just say, do you
3:45:17
have to use video in Google meet?
3:45:28
And I'm going to submit my question. So it shows my question.
3:45:34
to me. Now I'm going to switch back to my other tab where I'm running the slideshow.
3:45:48
I'm going to press escape. I'm going to go back to the slideshow drop down, presenter view,
3:46:00
audience tools, Continue recent.
3:46:06
Continue. And this is how the question would show for anyone that
3:46:15
is viewing this presentation. So Alter Eagle didn't post anonymously, right?
3:46:25
Or anything like that. So, I'm the presenter, and I'm looking at Presenter View, and this question
3:46:34
pops up, and when it's an appropriate time during the presentation,
3:46:40
I will answer the questions. I'll read the questions out and answer them.
3:46:46
So, in this module, we created a presentation using Google Slides.
Google Slides Recap
3:46:52
We started by reviewing its display screen. We learned how to change the view of a presentation, and we did that
3:47:02
after we entered text in some slides. We added an image to a slide, and moved on to adding,
3:47:11
deleting, and reordering slides. Before applying a theme to make our presentation more visually appealing,
3:47:20
and then we added transitions and animations to our presentation.
3:47:27
We went through delivering our entire presentation, and then ended by using
3:47:34
presenter view and audience tools. In Module 7, we'll be using Google Forms in six lessons.
Introduction to Google Forms
3:47:45
As usual, we're going to understand the forms display screen, and then we'll
3:47:51
create a form, add questions, send a form, link to a spreadsheet, and we'll end up
3:47:59
by you learning how to view responses. So I've gone back to the Google homepage, and by the way, when you're
3:48:09
using the menu, if you click on search, it will take you to this page.
3:48:16
I'm going to use the menu and go almost all the way to the bottom. And that's where you'll find forms.
3:48:23
And when we get in there, you're going to click the blank template,
3:48:30
just like other apps that we've used in the upper left hand corner. You can easily get back to the forms homepage.
3:48:38
You have your rename box. You have your star if you wanna star anything that's important to you.
3:48:45
So it goes in the starred folder in drive, as well as in your my drive.
3:48:54
On the upper right in forms, you have a different set of icons.
3:49:02
The first one that looks like a pallet you can use to customize your theme.
3:49:08
The second one that looks like an eyeball will take you into preview mode where you can preview your form.
3:49:15
Then you have your undo, redo, and send icons.
3:49:22
You also have a more ellipsis and from there you can make a copy of a
3:49:29
form, get a prefilled link, print, add collaborators, so on and so forth.
3:49:37
Underneath all of that, you're on the questions tab. That's the default tab that you'll be on when you come in.
3:49:45
Your questions tab is where you're going to create the questions for your form. You can also add titles and sections to your form.
3:49:54
And you'll get an example of sections here, um, when we start adding our questions.
3:50:00
Then you have the responses tab, which we will visit a little bit later.
3:50:05
And you also have a settings tab. So when you use the blank template, It gives you an untitled form
3:50:15
header section where you can also put a form description and it gives
3:50:20
you one untitled question block.
3:50:26
On the right side of your screen, you'll have like a sidebar and
3:50:31
it travels with all the questions that you add to your form. So on that sidebar, you have the ability to add a question.
3:50:40
to import questions that may exist on other forms you've created, to add a
3:50:46
title and description block, To add an image, video, and also a section.
3:50:54
And in your lower right hand corner, you have your question mark where you
3:51:01
can seek support and also give feedback.
3:51:07
Let's click where it says Untitled Form. And you're going to want to do Ctrl A, because that's not, it's placeholder text,
Creating Forms
3:51:15
but if you don't do Ctrl A and select it, it will continue to stay in there. So we are going to name this form, Google Workspace Survey.
3:51:30
And the form description is going to be, used to decide, And if our
3:51:41
organization will switch to Google Workspace, something like that.
3:51:52
Now you'll notice underneath that you can select any text in either of those two boxes and format it, insert a link.
3:52:01
You can even do number formatting and bulleted formatting, and then you can remove the formatting if necessary.
3:52:09
Now before we deal with the untitled question, We are going to insert a section.
3:52:18
So using the right sidebar, add section is the last icon.
Adding Questions and Sections
3:52:24
We're going to go ahead and click it. And now what we want to do is click on the untitled question,
3:52:32
and you'll notice the six dots in the upper center of that question.
3:52:38
If you put your mouse on those dots, it will allow you to move the question. We're good with where the question is.
3:52:47
If we wanted to move it, we could just slide it up and down by using that arrow.
3:52:53
So now we're going to deal with our section, which will make our series of questions a little bit more understandable.
3:53:01
So in that untitled section, I'm going to do Ctrl A.
3:53:08
And I'm going to type, please rate these Google apps by how often you use them.
3:53:21
And then in parentheses, I'm going to put one equals. Don't use semicolon five equals use daily and close the
3:53:34
parentheses and put a period. And so with the section, you'll notice the first section is the header.
3:53:45
And underneath that now, since we inserted another section, it says after section one, continue to next section.
3:53:52
There's a dropdown arrow to the right of that. And you can make a different choice here, but we, the default choice is
3:54:00
what we want, continue to next section. So in section two, we have the section header.
3:54:09
You notice it says there the description is optional. And for the section header, it has a more ellipsis to the right, and
3:54:18
you can see that you can duplicate the section, move it, delete it, or merge with the above section.
3:54:25
We're not going to put in a description. We're going to go down to our first untitled question and the
3:54:32
untitled question, you're simply going to type Gmail and then notice.
3:54:39
The answer type over on the right was multiple choice, and it automatically switched to short answer.
3:54:46
It doesn't really know what we're looking for. We're gonna do the drop down arrow next to short answer, and
3:54:52
we're gonna select linear scale. And it defaults to 1 to 5, which is what we want.
3:55:00
And we're gonna give the 1 and the 5 labels that mirror. what we put in the parentheses in the section header.
3:55:08
So the first label, next to the one, is going to be Don't Use.
3:55:19
And next to five, we're going to have a label that says Use Daily.
3:55:26
At this point, we have six more apps that we want to put on this form with the same
3:55:35
linear scale, same labels, and everything. So instead of using the plus sign to add a question on the right
3:55:42
sidebar, At the bottom of your Gmail question, you're going to hover over
3:55:47
the two pieces of paper and we're going to duplicate that question. And then all we have to change is the name of the app and this will be Sheets.
3:56:00
We're going to duplicate Sheets and it's going to be Docs.
3:56:06
We're going to duplicate Docs
3:56:14
and type Slides. Duplicate slides, type forms, and we have two more, and I'm going to have you do
3:56:26
them on your own by pausing the video. So you want to duplicate forms, and have a question for calendar,
3:56:34
and another question for contacts. So just to make sure you have them all.
3:56:42
It's Gmail, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms, Calendar, and Contacts.
3:56:50
And notice as I'm scrolling that that sidebar is traveling to the right of every question.
3:56:57
And so on the sidebar, we have the Contacts question selected. On the sidebar, we're going to add another new section.
3:57:08
It's going to be, I'm going to click where it says untitled section to my control a to select that text.
3:57:16
And I am going to type, please select any additional apps you currently use.
3:57:33
And again, we're not going to put in a description for that. What we're going to do is go over and we're going to add
3:57:40
a question using the sidebar. And this question, we want to make it, if you look at the answer type
3:57:49
first, it defaults to multiple choice. We're going to do the drop down and we're going to select check boxes so they
3:57:55
can have more than one thing selected. The question, we're just going to put apps.
3:58:02
And then we're gonna click where it says Option 1, and when you click there, it should select all of that text.
3:58:08
And we're gonna type chat. I can use my down arrow for it to go down to and select Option 2 for me.
3:58:17
And Option 2 is going to be spaces.
3:58:23
Option 3, meet. 4,
3:58:29
keep. 5. Tasks, and last but not least, Drive.
3:58:40
So then we decide to make our section headers bold. So I'm gonna just click on that section 3 of 3 header, select everything.
3:58:51
And I can use control B here, or I can click on the B icon.
3:58:57
And I'm gonna go up to my Section 2 header and do the same thing.
3:59:09
And I think the, um, title is fine.
3:59:16
So, the next topic is sending a form. But before I send a form, I like to preview it.
Previewing Forms and Applying Themes
3:59:23
So go ahead and click on your eyeball icon in the upper right.
3:59:29
And you'll see next, it gives you the title block, and then when you do next, it goes to the next section and includes the title block at the top.
3:59:38
And so this is our section two, where we're listing the apps and using the linear scale.
3:59:45
And then at the bottom, you have back, next, and clear form, although you're not
3:59:51
going to use this to fill out the form. We're going to choose next, and it takes us to our third and final section.
3:59:59
About other apps, and I'll show you that preview opened in its own tab.
4:00:05
So I'm going to close the preview tab here
4:00:11
and just re maximize my browser window. So once we preview the form, and this is also not on the outline, but I'm
4:00:20
going to show it to you real quick. You might want to make it more visually appealing. So we're going to go to the paint palette icon to customize the theme here.
4:00:31
You can change your fonts and font sizes. You can add images.
4:00:37
I'm just going to change my color. And so the background color, as well as the header, the section colors,
4:00:48
really get the color that I chose. And notice the background is a little bit lighter.
4:00:55
I can make that darker if I like. And I'm going to go ahead and close the theme panel.
4:01:04
So now you can go ahead and click on the send button in the upper right corner.
Sending and Filling Out Forms
4:01:10
And you can send forms via email, which is the default. via link, you can get a link to the form and copy it, and then you can send the
4:01:19
link via chat or some other mechanism. And you can also embed it on an HTML page.
4:01:26
We're gonna keep it on email, and I'm gonna send it to my alter ego.
4:01:34
I'm also at the bottom going to include it in the form in an email. I usually check that because I like to do that, um, although
4:01:42
you don't have to check it. So I'll leave that choice up to you. I'm going to go ahead and address it.
4:01:48
It gives the subject, which is the name of the form, and it gives a
4:01:53
default message and I'm fine with that. So I'm going to address it. I can add someone else as an editor of the form in the bottom left if
4:02:02
I want to, so when they receive it, they can actually edit it. Otherwise, I'm just mimicking how someone who's responding to it would respond.
4:02:13
So I'm gonna go ahead and address this and click send. In my alter email, I see I can just click the link to fill out the form.
4:02:24
And it lets me know that it's gonna automatically save. My work, I'll just say, okay, so here's, I'm going to click next and I'm going
4:02:35
to just do some random numbers on this linear scale here, random choices.
4:02:53
And then when I get to the bottom on this section, I'm going to go next and fill out the last section and you can do the same and then you'll have your submit button.
4:03:06
So there's a setting that allows respondents to submit another response.
4:03:12
And I'd like us to submit another response and mix it up a little bit from your first response.
4:03:21
So, Alter has submitted two responses. I'm gonna switch back over to my Trish account.
4:03:28
So now, you'll see at the top of my screen, there's a 2, the number 2, to
4:03:36
the right of my responses tab, because I've received two responses to this form.
4:03:46
So, I'm going to go to the responses tab. At the top, it says two responses.
Viewing Responses
4:03:53
It's on a summary tab, there's also a question tab, so these are the
4:04:01
tab locations I'm talking about. Summary, question, and there is, there is also an individual tab.
4:04:12
And above those tabs on the right. You'll see a green icon, and if you hover over it, it says Create Spreadsheet,
4:04:20
and we'll get back to that in a few. It also has, um, more options, so we'll go over some of these.
4:04:32
And this form is accepting responses, and this is a key one.
4:04:37
Let's say you're doing this survey and you want to end the survey in two weeks.
4:04:44
In two weeks, you can come in and toggle that so the form no longer accepts responses.
4:04:52
And then on the Summary tab, you're seeing each question, and it's
4:04:57
showing both of the responses. For each of those linear scale questions, right?
4:05:06
So you're seeing everything. And then it's showing the additional apps responses.
4:05:13
And you'll notice to the right of all the responses, you could copy the chart, if you'd like, and paste it somewhere else, as necessary.
4:05:25
If you go to the question tab, It's showing the first question, right?
4:05:31
So, it's showing both responses for Gmail.
4:05:37
There's a right arrow you can use to go to the next question, or you can do the drop down next to Gmail and go through the questions that way.
4:05:48
And lastly, you have the Individual tab, and you'll notice at the top of the
4:05:54
Individual tab, you can print responses. It's on Response 1.
4:06:00
So, it's showing all the questions. and all the responses for the first respondent.
4:06:06
And back up at the top, I can go to the next response and look at those in the same manner.
4:06:14
So you have your summary tab, your question tab, and your individual
4:06:22
tab, which can be printed. A really cool feature in Forms And you can do this from any of the responses tabs.
Linking Forms to Spreadsheets
4:06:34
Is you can link the form to a spreadsheet. And the spreadsheet will be stored in Drive.
4:06:41
And the responses will be in the spreadsheet as they come in.
4:06:46
So in order to do that, we're going to use that green icon. In the upper right corner.
4:06:53
And when you hover over it, it says create spreadsheet. We're going to go ahead and click on that and it gives you the ability
4:07:01
to create a new spreadsheet or select an existing spreadsheet.
4:07:07
So let's cancel out of here for a moment because I realized that we
4:07:13
never clicked in our rename box. So let's click in our rename box so we get the Google workspace survey name up
4:07:20
there and then we'll go to the green icon.
4:07:26
So instead of saying untitled form now, so it's going to create a new spreadsheet, and it's going to be named after your form, and in
4:07:34
parentheses it will say responses. And we're going to go ahead and create.
4:07:44
So you can see it automatically opens the form, it gives it a timestamp, and it's
4:07:50
showing you the responses by question. And because this is on drive, If there are more responses, this
4:08:00
spreadsheet will update as well.
4:08:05
In this module, we focused on using Google Forms. We started by getting into Forms and understanding the Forms display screen.
Google Forms Recap
4:08:16
And then we created a form. We added sections.
4:08:21
And then questions. And then you learned how to preview your form.
4:08:28
And we decided to add a theme to it for some more visual appeal.
4:08:35
You then learned how to view your form responses in forms. And how to link the form to a spreadsheet.
4:08:43
And you saw how the spreadsheet is where you could go to view your form responses as well.
4:08:50
In our eighth and final module, we'll be using Google Meet over eight lessons.
Introduction to Google Meet
4:08:56
We'll start by scheduling a video meeting from Google Calendar. You'll learn how to join a video meeting, and then you'll learn
4:09:05
about the Meet display screen. You'll also learn how to present your screen during a meeting, and then how to
4:09:15
manage meetings, how to change your audio and video settings, how to start a video.
4:09:21
Meeting both from Gmail and ending with starting a video meeting from Google Meet.
4:09:29
So we're going to get started by scheduling a video meeting from Google Calendar.
Scheduling Meetings
4:09:35
I'm going to use the apps menu to get to my calendar and I'm going
4:09:42
to just go two days out for me. It would be Friday the 13th. And I am going to double click on any appointment line.
4:09:52
And so the first thing I'm going to do at the top on the left is I'm going to add a title and this is going to be called company wide meeting.
4:10:04
I'm going to set this to an all day event that does not repeat.
4:10:10
And my scenario for this is I have people in time zones all across the United States.
4:10:15
So the meeting will go from eight to 5 p. m. And it will start in the earliest time zone.
4:10:23
So that's the east coast and travel across the country until everybody is in the meeting at the same time.
4:10:31
Under event details, the first thing you see is add Google Meet video conferencing and I'm going to click that.
4:10:38
It gives me a code. I'm going to click in add location and I'm going to type the word remote and
4:10:46
you notice it brings up a bunch of stuff called remote all around the country. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just click away from that.
4:10:54
So it just selects my remote.
4:10:59
I'm going to change my availability to busy. On the left. And then in the ad description box, I'm going to type, this is the meeting
4:11:11
where we will discuss whether to adopt Google workspace for our organization.
4:11:28
Your input is critical for this decision looking forward.
4:11:38
to picking your brains. On the right side, I'm going to go ahead and add my alter ego as a guest.
4:11:49
Once you add guests here, press enter, and then you'll see them down below.
4:11:55
If the guest you're adding is already on the list, when you click there, you can just click on them and they will show down below.
4:12:03
So under guest permissions on the right, I'm going to say that my guests
4:12:08
can only see the guest list, not modify the event or invite others.
4:12:14
Up at the top, I'm going to go ahead and click on save. And it asked me if I'd like to send invitation emails to Google Calendar
4:12:22
guests, and I'm going to choose send.
4:12:28
So the all day event shows up at the very top of that day. It's not on any specific time slot because it's an all day event.
4:12:38
Even without sending an email, this event is already on Alter Ego's calendar as a pending event.
4:12:47
I'm going to switch over now to Alter Ego's email.
4:12:52
In Alter's email, I'm going to just respond to this.
4:12:58
I'm going to just say yes, click the yes button. And if I scroll down and slightly to the right, when I'm ready to join the
4:13:07
meeting, I can use this link in the email. Now back on Trisha's calendar, I can double click that company wide meeting and
4:13:17
you can see here, I have an RSVP, right? I can add a note for guests and you can see down here that two guests,
4:13:26
including myself, the organizer. I have two yeses, so it keeps a tally of people responding and I'm
4:13:35
going to just go ahead and save.
4:13:40
Now I am going to join the meeting from my calendar.
Joining and Participating in Meetings
4:13:45
I'm back in my Trish calendar. I'm going to just double click it to open it up. And now the icon says join with Google meet.
4:13:56
I don't have my video. I have my video lid closed. And in that video screen at the bottom, you can turn off your
4:14:04
microphone or turn off your camera. And this would be universal for everyone.
4:14:10
You also can check your audio and video if necessary. On the right side of, on the bottom of the video, you see apply visual effects.
4:14:22
So I'm going to go ahead and click on that, and it opens up a new pane, and it's on the effects tab.
4:14:29
And by the way, if you had checked your audio and video, it would be on the audio and video tab.
4:14:37
So, on the effects tab, there's a couple of new things there. And then there's a bunch of backgrounds, and then filters if I
4:14:49
scroll down, and then there are styles.
4:14:55
So, if I want to apply a different background in my home office, and I'm going to go back to the top, and I'm going to click the
4:15:05
X in the upper right hand corner. Now on the right side, it's letting me know that no one else is here.
4:15:12
I can join now. I'm going to go ahead and join now.
4:15:19
So that was like a preview. And now you're seeing the meeting interface.
4:15:25
And on the bottom left, it tells you the time, the name of the meeting.
4:15:31
You have a series of icons. This, you can turn off your microphone or you can turn off your camera.
4:15:37
You can also turn on captions. A participant can raise their hand to get your attention if you're presenting.
4:15:45
Present now gives me the ability to present my screen to everyone in the meeting.
4:15:50
Then there's more options. Where I can open a jam whiteboard, I can change the layout, apply
4:15:58
visual effects, some of the stuff that's on the icons there, report a problem, so on and so forth.
4:16:05
And then you have the hang up button, or leave call, when you're ready to leave the call.
4:16:11
On the right, you have meeting details, information icons, so when I click that,
4:16:17
it shows me the details of the meeting, it shows the name, the description.
4:16:22
The time, the date and time, the fact that it's located at remote.
4:16:28
And then if I needed to copy the joining info really quickly and send it to somebody in a chat, I can get it right from there.
4:16:36
And I'm going to close the meeting details pane.
4:16:42
And then to the right of that, it's letting me know that there's only one person in the meeting. It's showing, I can show everyone and you're just seeing me.
4:16:50
If I click that icon, I can. Open up a chat screen that I can send chats to everyone.
4:16:59
And by default, people that are in the meeting can also send chat messages.
4:17:06
I can close that panel. Usually, um, if I'm doing a remote training course with live people
4:17:14
in the audience, not a video, then I have the chat on so that people that, you know, can't speak up or whatever can still participate.
4:17:23
Then there's an activities icon where you can get to breakout rooms, polls, record your meetings.
4:17:30
Whiteboards, and last but not least, there are host controls.
4:17:37
And so I'm the host and I am turning on host management.
4:17:43
I'm letting everybody in the meetings then share their screens and chat messages, turn on their microphones and turn on their videos.
4:17:53
So now Alter is going to join the meeting and Alter is going to join from that join meeting button in the email that she was sent.
4:18:04
So the first thing you'll see is someone wants to join this call. As the host you can remove anyone at any time.
4:18:11
I'm going to go ahead and admit and that's just a setting that I used. And now my screen changes, alter ego is not on video.
4:18:21
So they just show as the letter a and my video is now in the lower right hand corner.
4:18:28
It's the opposite on alter ego screen. My video fills up most of the screen and their letter a is
4:18:35
in the lower right corner. So at this point I want to share my screen.
Presenting Screens
4:18:41
I want to share that Google workspace survey form.
4:18:47
With everybody in the meeting. So I'm going to go down to my present now icon and I'm going to share a tab.
4:18:55
So your choice is your entire screen, a window or a tab. I have the form open in a different browser tab and then I can see the
4:19:05
survey there and I'm going to share.
4:19:11
And so now I can see. And everybody in the meeting can see this survey form and we can
4:19:19
discuss it during the meeting. And then if I want to stop sharing at the top, I can choose stop sharing.
4:19:32
Now in the meantime, on alter screen, my shared screen is
4:19:37
taking up most of the space. My video is on the top right.
4:19:43
I'm going to choose stop sharing. So now when I look in my lower right corner, first of all, I'm seeing that
Messaging and Leaving Meetings
4:19:51
there are two people in the meeting and to the right of that, I have a little notification on the chat with everyone.
4:19:59
When I open it up, I can see that alter ego. Send me a chat and I can reply back.
4:20:08
Everybody in the meeting would see this.
4:20:16
And that's how that works. And I'm going to go ahead and close the in call messages window.
4:20:25
And now we'll just make believe that this meeting is over. So at the bottom, I'm going to click the hang up, the leave call button.
4:20:34
And because I'm the host, I can end the video call for everyone. Um, I'm gonna do that.
4:20:40
Otherwise, you would just leave the call and everyone can hang up on their own. But in my case, since I'm managing two people in a meeting at the
4:20:48
same time, that ended for me. And so, it always asks you for a survey, and I'm gonna give my feedback.
4:20:57
And it takes me to Google Meet's home screen.
4:21:03
I'm back in Trisha's calendar. And I want to show you some other things that you can do in
Managing Meetings
4:21:08
terms of managing your meetings. So I'm going to just double click this company wide meeting and again,
4:21:18
the link is still active here, right? But what I'm going to do is up at the top, I'm going to select the
4:21:26
more actions dropdown so you can print out your meeting details.
4:21:32
You can delete a meeting from here. You can duplicate a meeting if you have a similar one coming up.
4:21:39
Alright. You can publish an event. And if you click on that, it gives you a, a block of HTML code.
4:21:49
So if you have your website, you can use this code on your site so that visitors can add this event to their calendar.
4:21:56
Or, you can copy the link to the event from that dropdown.
4:22:03
And then the only other option you have is to change the owner. So I'm the owner of this, you know, I'm the organizer, therefore the owner, I'm
4:22:13
the owner of this meeting, or I could set it up and switch it to someone
4:22:18
else as the owner of the meeting. And I'm going to go ahead and close this company wide meeting.
4:22:29
Now, let's say that you have multiple cameras and multiple microphones on your computer or computers.
Audio and Video Settings
4:22:37
So I'm going to double click this company wide meeting again, and I'm going to rejoin it as myself.
4:22:44
No need for me to get, um, alter in this one. So down at the bottom where it says, check your audio and video.
4:22:53
This is one thing you can do. You're seeing your levels here, right? And I'm going to just close that panel and then I'm going to join now.
4:23:07
And when I join now, I'm going to go to this ellipsis to the left of the leave call button,
4:23:17
and I'm going to go to settings and this is where I can see.
4:23:22
My default microphone versus any other microphones that I might have, right?
4:23:29
And it's showing I'm on the default and you're seeing my voice register there, right?
4:23:35
And then I can go to my speakers down here. And these are the speakers that I can be using, my choices of speakers.
4:23:45
And then on the left, I can go to video and I can choose which camera I want to use.
4:23:54
Right. And I can also adjust my video. Lighting.
4:24:00
So once you join a meeting and you go to settings, if you're having problems with your audio and video, a lot of times it's because it's defaulting to
4:24:10
the wrong audio or video source and you can change it through settings.
4:24:17
I'm going to go ahead and close that screen and I'm going to leave this call.
4:24:25
I'll end it for everyone. And I'm going to return to the home screen for Meet.
4:24:34
Now from the home screen for Meet, you can of course start a new meeting, or
4:24:40
join one by entering a code or a link. But in the upper right hand corner, you have settings as well.
4:24:47
And so before you join a meeting, if you're joining it from me, you can make sure your defaults are right in terms of audio and video.
4:24:59
Our final lesson is how to start a video meeting from Gmail.
Starting Meetings
4:25:04
So I'm going to navigate using my apps menu to Gmail and if you do this next
4:25:14
thing once you won't have to do it again. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to link Gmail to meet and to do
4:25:22
that I'm going to use the settings gear in the upper right hand corner.
4:25:28
And right under apps and Gmail, you'll see chat and meet, and then underneath it, a customized link, which we're going to click at the bottom.
4:25:38
I'm going to just go ahead and check both of those boxes, chat and meet.
4:25:43
And then I'm going to choose done. And it lets you know that your Gmail needs to reload.
4:25:48
So those changes. So I'm going to go ahead and reload.
4:25:55
And like I said, that's a one and done. If you ever want to undo it, you just go back to the gear and uncheck
4:26:02
those two things and customize. And so on the left side of your screen, now you'll see four icons,
4:26:09
mail, chat spaces, and meet. We're going to click on meet.
4:26:17
And when you come in here, you can start a new meeting or you can join a meeting with a code.
4:26:24
Before we do that, let me explain my meetings. It says any video meetings scheduled in Google calendar will show
4:26:31
up here until you access them. So we access that company wide meeting.
4:26:38
Otherwise it would be showing in this list. Now it would show in this list for alter as well.
4:26:43
If they customize their Gmail and If they have accepted or responded
4:26:50
to the invitation, we're going to go ahead and click on new meeting.
4:26:56
And then it just says, share your new meeting, copy this link and send it to people you want to meet with.
4:27:02
Be sure you save it so you can use it later too. I'm going to go ahead and copy the link.
4:27:08
Now I could copy that link and send it to somebody in an email. I could send it to somebody in a chat down at the bottom.
4:27:17
I can send an invite, right? The other option I have, so this could be like an off the cuff meeting, right?
4:27:24
Need to meet with somebody like right now. So I'm going to go ahead and click start now.
4:27:33
And I have my camera shuttered, but it took me right into the meeting.
4:27:38
So I'm dumped right into the meeting here. I'm going to go ahead and leave the call and I can rejoin.
4:27:49
I'm going to return to the home screen. And now I'm back on my Meet app.
4:27:56
And you can also, right from the Google Meet home screen, You can
4:28:02
click on new meeting from here. You can create a meeting for later.
4:28:07
You can start an instant meeting or you can schedule in Google calendar.
4:28:13
I'm going to choose create a meeting for later. And it basically just gives me the link, which I can copy, send it to people.
4:28:23
And you want to make sure that you send it to yourself so you have that link for yourself as well.
4:28:29
So a few more choices than the linking Meet to Gmail that you have when you start a new meeting from the Google Meet home screen.
4:28:39
In this eighth and final module, we began using Google Meet. We started by scheduling a video meeting from Google Calendar.
Google Meet Recap
4:28:48
And then you learned how to join a video meeting. From Google Calendar, as well as from an invitee's email.
4:28:58
We went over the meet display screen, and you learned how to present your screen in a meeting.
4:29:05
We went on to managing meetings, looking at all the other options that we have available.
4:29:10
You learned how to change your audio and video settings. And then we moved on to linking Meet with Gmail and starting
4:29:19
a video meeting from Gmail. And we ended by starting a video meeting from Google Meet.
4:29:27
Thank you for viewing this Google workspace video course. We started this course by using Google drive.

4:30:08
you learned how to search for files. Add shortcuts to my drive and work with drive priority and workspaces for
4:30:17
those of you with workspace accounts. We moved on to changing Google drive settings, and then you
4:30:25
learned how to sign into multiple Google accounts for ease of access.
4:30:31
Our second module, we still continued in Google Drive, but we changed our focus to collaborating.
4:30:39
So you learned how to share a file or folder and also how to share a link
4:30:44
to a file or folder before we were able to publish a file to the web.
4:30:51
Our third module got us started working with common features where
4:30:56
we opened the docs application And you learned the things that are
4:31:01
common between many Google apps.
4:31:06
So you learned how to use the menu bar and the toolbar, how to rename your documents.
4:31:14

4:31:23
Download files to in other formats and also how to open a Microsoft
4:31:30
Office file in a Google app. And then we use that file to start working with versions.
4:31:38
We switched our focus solely to Google Sheets. So we started by going over its display screen.
4:31:45
And then we input some data and you learned a couple of shortcuts along the way.
4:31:52
We created formulas and then we moved on to working with functions.
4:31:58

4:32:29
In the fifth module, we focused on Google Docs. So we understood its display screen.
4:32:36
We typed a few paragraphs. You learned how to change the view of a document, how to
4:32:43
insert images and page numbers. Also, how to work with styles, which feed into the document
4:32:52
outline, which we covered. And then you learned how to collaborate with suggesting mode
4:32:59

4:33:51
Before delivering a presentation. We ended by learning how to use presenter view and audience tools.
4:34:01
In the seventh module, we used Google Forms. Of course, we learned the forms display screen, which differs slightly
4:34:10
from the other ones in that it doesn't have a toolbar or a menu bar. We created a form.
4:34:16
We added sections and questions. And then we learned how to preview a form before we applied a theme to it.
4:34:26
You learned how to view the form responses both in Google Forms and
4:34:31
by linking the form to a spreadsheet where you can view the responses.
4:34:37

hello everyone what is up welcome back to my channel if you're new here hi i'm maddie i run ed tech classroom the blog
0:07
podcast and of course youtube channel in today's video i'm going to be giving a beginner's tutorial to google classroom
0:14
so in this video i'm going to be walking you through how to use google classroom i'll be sharing some ideas for ways you
0:20
can use this tool with your students again this is very much a beginner's tutorial i'm really just giving a
0:26
general overview of how to use this tool it will also have some other videos that i've created that i think will be really
0:32
helpful that dive more deeply into some of those specific google classroom features in the description down below
0:38
so be sure to watch this video first and then if you're looking to dive even more deeply you can check out some of those
0:44
other videos linked down below so without further ado let's get started
0:57
so right now i am on the google classroom website and the way i got here is i just went to
1:03
classroom.google.com i will have that url linked for you guys in the video description down below so you can click
1:10
it and you can actually follow along as i walk you through this tutorial video
1:15
so again we are on the google classroom website here and you'll see that i don't have any classes set up let's pretend
1:22
i'm brand new to google classroom and so this is what you'll see if you've never used this tool before
1:28
in the center of our screens here it says add a class to get started and there are two choices either to create a
1:34
class or to join a class create a class is going to be the option that you click if you are a teacher
1:40
looking to create a class in google classroom and if you are a student looking to join
1:46
your teachers class you would want to click the button that says join class now because this tutorial video is for
1:51
teachers we're going to be actually creating a class now there's actually also another way that you can create a
1:58
class to get started and you can do that by clicking here in the top right hand corner on this plus button and then
2:04
again you'll want to click the button that says create class now you'll see after i clicked that
Notification
2:10
button to create a class i'm receiving this notification here that says using classroom at a school with students now
2:18
you might also receive this notification if you are a teacher who's using you
2:23
know your personal gmail or if your school does not have a google workspace for education account you might receive
2:30
a notification like this i'm going to go ahead and click this check box but this is something that you should look more
2:36
into if you do receive this notification next i'm going to press continue and you'll see that now i have a few
Class Name
2:43
options that i need to fill out here to actually create my class so at the very
2:48
top here it says class name required so this is where you're going to type in the name of your class so for example if
2:55
you are a fifth grade teacher and you're wanting to create a fifth grade math section you would just want to type in
3:01
fifth grade math here for example i'm going to type in stem class here
3:06
just as just as an example for today's video and then underneath that you'll see that we have section subject and
3:13
room now i personally never really find myself filling out that section subject
3:18
or room options here instead actually what i typically might do is i might say
3:24
something like you know fifth grade stem class here so that students who are in
3:29
fifth grade are so that if i teach multiple grade levels for example i'm really able to stay organized so instead
3:36
of adding the section or the grade in that section category i personally like to include it under that class name
3:43
for now i'm just going to go ahead and delete that but wanted to let you know that that is an option so you can include this section you can include the
3:50
subject you can include the room if you would like none of those fields are required but they are an option for you
3:56
now i'm going to go ahead and click on the create button to create my class it'll take a second to load google
4:01
classroom needs to kind of set everything up for you and then you'll actually begin to
4:07
be able to customize your class so you'll see here i am taken to this
Stream Tab
4:13
class here called stem class you know that it is the stem class because you'll see in the top left hand corner i have
4:20
that title of the class and i also have it on this big banner across the top of my screen here
4:26
so the way i'm going to walk you through this tutorial is i'm going to go tab by
4:31
tab so at the top of our screen you'll see that we are on the stream tab right now there are four different tabs we
4:38
have stream classwork people and grades for now we're going to focus on this stream tab so this stream tab is
4:45
actually a place where you as the teacher can talk to your class so i always recommend that teachers use this
4:52
stream tab to share announcements post assignments and respond to student
4:57
questions primarily though we're really using this stream tab as a place to
5:03
share announcements so you'll see that there is a um section right here that says announce something
5:09
to your class so i can click here and i can actually create an announcement um so for example i could type something
5:16
like welcome to google classroom in today's class we will be going over
5:24
how to use this tool please bring your chromebook
5:30
to class today and that would be an announcement that i could potentially share with my class
5:36
now you'll see first i have this stem class a section grade out here now because i only have one class set up in
5:43
google classroom currently that's why it's grayed out but you actually would have the option to select other classes
5:50
that you would like to also share this announcement to so for something like this that's really a general
5:55
announcement i would have the ability to select other classes if i would like to share it to those classes as well
6:01
now next here you'll see we have this all students tab we'll take a look at this more in depth when we are actually
6:07
showing how to create an assignment in google classroom but for now essentially what you need to know about this is you
6:12
can actually only send announcements to certain groups of students if you would like so for example if you know there's
6:19
five students that you want to share an announcement to you can actually click on those five students names instead of
6:25
sending it to all students in your class for now i'm just going to go ahead and click on all students and then i can
6:32
post this announcement at the bottom here too you'll see that google classroom recently in 2021 added some of
6:38
these features to actually add formatting which i find to be so helpful they used to actually not have any
6:45
formatting so you weren't able to you know play around with how this looks stylistically i personally find myself
6:52
using this bulleted list quite frequently in google classrooms so i'm really happy that they added these new
6:57
formatting features and at the bottom here too you'll also see that there are some places for you to add links and
7:03
files so for example if you wanted to attach something from google drive if you wanted to upload a file from your
7:09
computer if you wanted to add a link to a website or if you wanted to add a youtube video you could do that here
7:16
i'll show you what those buttons look like more when we're in the classwork tab creating an actual assignment so
7:22
next what i can do is i can go over here to the post option and i can actually post this immediately for students in my
7:29
google classroom to see or if i'd like to actually save this for later i can click on this drop down menu
7:36
and i can choose to either schedule this post to go live at a certain time
7:42
or i can just save this as a draft to come back to later i personally really like to schedule announcements so that
7:48
students receive them at a specific time this is particularly helpful if you want students to see this reminder a few
7:55
minutes before class to know that they actually need to bring their chromebook for example i might want to schedule
8:01
this so it pops up on students devices you know 30 minutes before class for example
8:07
but for now i'm just going to go ahead and press post so you can see what this looks like so this stream here essentially i kind
Stream Settings
8:13
of like to explain this to teachers as it's almost like a facebook news feed
8:20
where it becomes this sort of stream of consciousness type style where ever all of these posts are happening in
8:26
chronological order with the newest post up at the top and then older posts are going to be at the bottom
8:33
any time you upload a new assignment to google classroom that will also automatically get uploaded to this
8:39
stream tab for students to be able to see now another feature i want to point out
8:45
is i did mention that sometimes you can respond to student questions in this
8:50
stream tab so students currently the automatic feature for students in google
8:55
classroom is for them to actually be able to post announcements on the stream
9:00
tab and to be able to comment now if you teach younger students you
9:06
might want to actually turn that feature off in my experience i have found when i've given students the ability to
9:12
actually comment or post on google classroom on this stream feature here
9:18
they've kind of flooded this um page now that's a really great opportunity for you to of course you know have some
9:24
conversations around agreements digital citizenship but i personally like to just kind of avoid having that happen
9:30
and i will actually adjust the settings so that only the teacher and co-teachers are able to post in this stream now
9:38
that's just me you guys know your students better than i do so feel free to um you know kind of take that idea if
9:44
you'd like or if you think it's great for your students to be able to post then go for it the way that you can
9:50
actually make those adjustments is up here in the settings if you click on settings i can scroll down here to where
9:56
it says stream and it says students can post and comment i can choose here for only
10:02
teachers to be able to post or comment and so i'll go ahead and press save and i'll walk you through these settings
10:07
more in depth later but while we're talking about that i just wanted to go ahead and show you so again this is the stream tab now a
10:14
few other features that i want to point out here is on the left hand side you'll see that we have this option here that
10:20
says class code so there's a couple different ways that students can join your class and one of which is by
10:26
joining using this class code then next also we have this upcoming section this
10:31
is where it will show uh upcoming assignments so currently there's no work due soon because we haven't created any
10:37
assignments yet but that actually would be located here for you as the teacher and for students to be able to see
10:44
now the next thing we're going to do is we're actually going to customize this banner here so currently we uh google
10:51
classroom just kind of uses different um you know words essentially and if you say something like coding you might
10:57
notice that there's going to be a bunch of technology in this banner image if you say math there's going to be some
11:02
math images for this stem class here it looks like it went with this generic um maybe
11:08
breakfast theme i think i say grapefruit and some coffee i'm not really sure but you can actually change this if you'd
11:13
like so i'm going to go up here to where it says customize and now there are two choices first you can upload a photo so
11:20
i've seen many teachers have actually chosen to upload their own photo to this banner you know maybe it's a class photo
11:26
maybe it's a picture of your physical classroom maybe you created a really fun design using your bitmoji i've seen
11:33
teachers actually upload their own banners for me personally i typically just gravitate towards selecting one of the
11:40
themes that google has already created for us but i did want to point that out as an option so i'm going to click here
11:45
where it says select theme and then you'll see that these are the choices that google classroom has put together
11:50
for us so you'll see we have this um you know honors class here we have this
11:55
graduation image we have this book club we have a coding we have this one here
12:02
looks like under some sort of ipad or something happening we have reading et cetera so lots of choices for this stem
12:09
class i'm going to go ahead and click on this coding image here and i'm going to select that as my class
12:15
theme and now you'll see that the banner has changed so again you can choose to upload your own image or you can
12:21
customize by selecting one of the themes that google classroom has already put together for you so next let's take a
12:27
look at this classwork tab so we'll go up to the top here and we're going to click on the button that says classwork
Classwork
12:34
so this is actually the place where you are going to be assigning your work this is where as the teacher you can add
12:40
assignments and you can add other work for the class and then also organize it into different topics now i'm going to
12:46
show you how to do all of that so i personally always find myself on the
12:51
classwork tab automatically when you open up google classroom it typically will take you to
12:57
the stream tab but i always tell students focus on the classwork tab that
13:03
is the most important tab in google classroom so again right here we're on this classroom classwork tab and the
13:10
first thing we can do is create an assignment so i'm going to click here where it says create
Assignments
13:15
and you'll see we have this drop down menu with several options so first we can create an assignment which is what
13:21
i'm going to be doing next you also have the ability to actually create a quiz assignment so when you do this you can
13:28
create a quiz in google classroom for students to complete so basically what
13:33
that looks like is you can actually create a google form that's set up as a quiz for students to have to respond to
13:40
quiz questions so this is really useful if you are wanting to have you know post quizzes to google classroom and they
13:46
make it really easy for you to be able to do that using google forms then next we have this question option
13:53
where essentially you can ask students a question that they then can respond to now also we have this material choice so
14:00
the material choice here is going to be really useful if you just have you know handouts or something that you want
14:06
students to be looking at during class you can upload that here using material so there's not going to be anything for
14:12
students to actually submit as an assignment this would just be materials that you want students to be referencing
14:18
for an assignment or for class time and then next you also have the ability to reuse a post this is really useful if
14:25
you are teaching if you are a special area teacher and you have multiple sections for example so let's say you
14:32
are a elementary science teacher and you have you know you're teaching so many different classes this is really useful
14:38
so that you can reuse a post from class to class so let's say you know you teach three different third grade classes you
14:45
actually can reuse this post for all three of your third grade classes so really useful to be able to reuse
14:51
assignments with other classes and then next here we have the topic which you can use to stay organized i
14:57
will be showing you how to do that as well so for now let's go ahead and click here to where it says assignment so now
Create an Assignment
15:03
you'll see we're on this create an assignment um tab here and the first thing we can do is we can create a title
15:10
for our assignment so i can say um you know introduction
15:16
to coding activity and here i can add some instructions so
15:21
i might say something like for
15:26
today's assignment we are going to complete a coding activity using code.org
15:36
click on the link and complete level one of our coding puzzles
15:45
of our coding puzzle all right so again there's some of those formatting features maybe let's say
15:51
you'd like to you know bold coding activity for it to be really clear what students are going to be doing you know
15:56
maybe you want to italicize you could underline all of these formatting features you have the ability to use again i often
16:04
find myself using that bulleted list quite frequently and so next let me show you guys what some of these options down
16:10
here look like so if i click here where it says add google drive file i can actually attach
Attach Files
16:16
a file from my google drive so let's say that you have you know a slides presentation that you want to attach
16:22
here you have the ability to do that just by clicking on add google drive file you can click on the file that you
16:27
want to attach and you'll be good to go next you also have the ability to upload a file directly from your computer so
16:34
let's say you have a pdf that's attached that's saved on your computer you can attach that here by clicking this upload
16:40
button you can also add a link which is what i'm going to be doing for this assignment in particular and you can
16:47
also add a youtube video so i am going to add a link to this activity in particular so i'm going to click here on
Add Links
16:53
the add link button and i actually already have a link in my clipboard i copied a link to
17:00
the code.org activity that i'm referring to and i can just go ahead and paste that link and i can press add link and
17:07
you'll see it's actually been uploaded and attached to this activity so students know that for this activity in
17:13
particular they will need to complete this programming with angry birds activity a part of code.org
Create New Item
17:20
now next also you can't actually attach a new item so if you want to create something completely from scratch you
17:27
know before we talked about how you can upload a file that you already have in your google drive you also can create a
17:34
new file so if you you know come up with this idea for an assignment and you want
17:39
to create something from scratch you can do that by clicking on this plus button and you can create a new google doc a
17:45
new google slide sheet drawing form etc so that is something to point out now
Share Assignment
17:52
next over here on the right hand side you'll see that again you can choose which class you'd like to share the
17:57
assignment to you can choose if you'd like to share it with specific students or the entire class next you can choose
18:04
here the points so if you click on the drop down menu you can make this activity ungraded if you would like or
18:10
you can choose to have a number of points attached to this activity i might make this one be 10 points next here you
18:16
can also add a due date so let's say you want to select a specific due date you know maybe i want to choose for this
18:22
activity to be due on you know monday i could click on february 14th which is this upcoming monday and this activity
18:29
would be due for students then now next you can also add this to a topic which i will be showing you how to
Rubric
18:34
do later the next thing that i want to point out that i am really excited about is google classroom actually has a
18:41
rubric that that you can attach so if i click on rubric here i can actually
18:46
create a rubric that is really useful to allow students to
18:52
for you as the teacher to be able to grade students i actually have a google classroom rubric tutorial that i will
18:58
have linked in the video description down below to show you how this rubric feature works specifically i'm a really
19:04
big fan of using this feature to save you time so please be sure to check out that video if you're curious how you can
19:11
create a rubric and share it with students and then you can grade using google classroom
Scheduling
19:18
all right so now that i'm ready to share this assignment with students i can click on this assign button or just like
19:24
we could before i can click on this drop down menu and i can schedule the assignment so personally what i like to
19:30
do to stay organized is when i'm using google classroom with students i like to at the start of the month kind of go
19:37
through and schedule all of my google classroom posts for the dates that i want them to go live i personally just
19:43
find this to be a really great time saving tip for me that i can kind of plan everything out schedule it and i
19:49
don't have to worry about it on a daily basis now of course not everyone likes that approach
19:55
as you all know and as i know as an educator sometimes things you know happen last minute sometimes you can't
20:01
really always stick to your plan and so that's okay you don't have to always use that scheduling feature if you don't
20:06
want to you can automatically just kind of press the assign button and go from there so i'm going to go ahead and click
20:12
on this assign button to assign this activity to students now one more thing that i want to show
Creating Assignments
20:18
you guys about this create tab here is if i click on create and i create another assignment i do want to show you
20:25
this awesome feature where you can actually create a copy of a file for each student in your class so let's say
20:32
that i want to just say you know um coding
20:37
um reflection prompt on the google doc attached
20:43
type uh please share um
20:49
a strength and stretch you have in coding right now
20:58
i can't type right now all right so i'm going to click on this plus button to attach a new google doc
21:05
just to show you what this looks like so i can say you know of course as the teacher you can choose to make this more organized
21:12
but i can add a section for a strength and a section for a stretch and so i can call this coding reflection
21:19
i'll go back to google classroom all right so we're back on google classroom um i just kind of went back to the
Viewing Files
21:24
google classroom tab and you'll see that we have this coding reflection google doc that is attached here again you
21:31
might want to make the dock much more robust than i did but just showing you this as an example so here it says
21:37
coding reflection again and right here now it says students can view the file so if you have a file let's say a
21:43
reading activity that you want all of your students to be able to view where there's kind of one file that
21:49
they're all looking at you would want to choose this option here that says students can view file
Making Copies
21:54
but for something like this that is actually a reflection that you want students to be able to complete and edit
22:01
you can click on this drop down menu and you can click this option here that says make a copy for each student so
22:07
essentially what this does is it's really similar to if you imagine you know you have worksheets that you share
22:12
for students you have one file you print out 20 copies and you pass out one to each student in your class this
22:19
functions the exact same way so essentially what it does is you know you have one google doc file that you
22:25
created as a template and it is then going to create 20 different copies or one copy for every single student in
22:33
your class so if i click on make a copy for each student each student in your class again is
22:38
going to receive their own copy that they can edit so you're not going to have you know 20 students adding this
22:44
editing the same document instead they'll each have their own copy so i personally find that to be
22:49
really an amazing feature of google classroom now let's say just because this is a reflection prompt maybe i
22:56
don't want it to be graded i can click here on that drop down menu i can choose ungraded and i can press assign
23:03
so now you'll see that as this loads this assignment is going to be added to
23:08
the classwork tab on google classroom all right so you'll see here we have our
23:13
coding reflection prompt and we have our introduction to coding activity you'll see here right now it says that zero
23:20
students have turned it in and zero students have been assigned this activity now that's because i haven't
23:26
added any students to my google classroom yet now when you have you know let's say you've uploaded your 20
23:32
students to google classroom they're all in your account this number right here is going to say assigned to 20 or
23:38
however many students you have you've chosen to assign the activity to and then here you would see the number that
23:44
i've turned in the activity now because zero students have completed this activity zero students have turned it in
23:50
this number here is going to say zero but as students start to actually turn in this assignment um you will start to
23:58
see this number grow so it's really helpful for you to see you know let's say you know 12 out of 16 students have
24:04
turned this in it's really useful for you to be able to see these numbers right here just quickly at a glance all
24:11
right now the next thing i want to show you guys is how you can kind of get organized with google classroom so if
24:16
you click here on this create button you can click on topic to actually create these headers for these um for your
24:23
different um sections for example or your different units so let's say i
24:29
you know unit 1 is going to be intro to coding
24:34
i can actually create this topic which is going to be essentially like a header and as the teacher you can kind of drag
24:40
and drop these to keep things organized for students so all of the files that are going to be
24:45
associated with unit one you could put under this unit one topic here i could
24:50
create another topic for unit two and you know maybe this one is going to be maker challenges
24:58
i can add that and you'll see that now there's another topic you can rearrange
25:03
these topics to um you know maybe you want to start with unit one at the top and then go all the way down to the
25:09
bottom or maybe you want new new topics to appear as the
25:14
you know class progresses there's a couple different ways that you can do this but i really like these topics to
25:19
help stay organized in google classroom you'll also see that these topics appear
25:25
here on the left hand side as buttons that students can click on to take them directly to that uh unit or you as the
25:32
teacher can click on those two to take you directly to that unit which i find to be really helpful
25:38
all right so now that we've kind of done a quick overview of the classwork tab let's move on to the people tab of
25:45
google classroom so i'm going to click here where it says people and you'll see that we have teachers and
People Tab
25:50
students so here where there is this person with a plus sign this is a button i can click on to actually invite other
25:57
teachers so let's say that you have a co-teacher um that you want to invite to google classroom you can actually click
26:04
on this option here type in their google account type in their email address and we'll it will actually share them as a
26:10
uh to be a co-teacher in your google classroom next here also this is where you can invite students now if you
26:17
remember at the beginning of this video i mentioned that there's a couple different ways that students can join
26:23
your google classroom first you have the ability to click on this invite students and you can
26:28
actually type in students email addresses here another way that you can add students to google classroom is you
26:36
can actually click here on this stream tab you can share this class code here with students you can project it on your
26:43
board you can you know share it with students in whichever whatever way you think kind of makes sense and they can
26:48
actually type in this join code to be able to join google classroom so the two
26:53
different ways essentially that students can join your class is you can type in their email address or you can share
26:59
this join code with them to fill out when they um go to the google classroom website
27:04
so i'm going to click here on the people tab and i'm actually going to invite um my student email address so my edtech
27:13
classroom student gmail.com and i'm going to press invite
27:20
so you'll see that my edtech classroom student has now been invited once that student actually accepts the invitation
27:27
they will then appear here as a part of the google classroom so you'll see that i went ahead and i just accepted the
Email Students
27:34
invitation to this google classroom as ed tech student and you'll see that now the name is here now something that's
27:40
useful is once a student is in your class you can click on these three dots here and you can choose to email the
27:46
student directly i find that to be a really useful feature you can remove a student from your class let's say they
27:52
drop your class or you can even choose to mute a student i've never clicked on this button so i'm not entirely sure
27:58
what it does i would imagine it just makes it so that they aren't able to comment on the stream and things like
28:03
that um but anyways i find myself probably using this email student feature the most
People
28:08
but you might not really choose to ever use this feature but did just want to point it out so again edtech student
28:14
accepted the google classroom invitation and so this is essentially what the people tab looks like really i only ever
28:21
use this tab to kind of set up google classroom and then i never find myself kind of engaging with this tab once the
28:27
class has been created so of course you will have probably many more than just one student in this class but hopefully
28:34
this gives you an idea of what this people tab actually looks like now next we're going to click here on the grades
Grades
28:39
tab and i want to point out a few features to you um so this is actually like a
28:45
gigantic grade book so up at the top here you'll see that this is where all of the assignments are going to go all
28:51
the way across the top here and then on the left hand side that's where you'll see all of the students are going to
28:57
appear so right now again we only have two assignments and we have one student in our class now you'll actually
29:03
see here that edtech student scored an 8 out of 10 on this intro to coding activity
29:10
you um this will actually pop up automatically if you are having students you know complete a quiz for example or
29:17
if you're using that rubric feature that i was talking about and you're kind of grading for students all of that
29:22
information will autofill in here for you in this gradebook tab again if you
29:27
want to check out how that rubric and grading works i highly recommend you check out that other tutorial video that
29:33
i will have linked in the video description down below for you guys another way that you can also grade is
29:39
you can type in grades manually here so you know let's say that you know you uh you previously gave a text student an 8
29:45
out of 10 but you know maybe you you went back and you decided to change their score to an 8.5 you can actually
29:51
do that to where now this score has actually been adjusted um so all of their grades will kind of appear here as
29:58
a as a digital grade book for you as the teacher to reference now the next thing i want to show you guys is the settings
Settings
30:05
feature so we visited the settings button a little bit ago at the start of the video when we were talking about the stream
30:12
i'm going to go ahead and click back on that so i can point out some of the other features for you guys so if i click on settings you'll see that this
30:18
is where we have the class details if you want to make any adjustments to your class details you can do that in the
30:24
settings here now next we also have this general section so this is where you know you can create those invite codes
General
30:31
so you can share an invite link with students you can share a class code or you can kind of display this class code
30:37
those are different ways that students can join your class for the first time then next here this is where we have the
30:43
stream um features here so the stream only teachers can post or comment that's the feature that we adjusted at the
30:49
beginning of this video you also have classwork on the stream i can show you what that looks like
30:55
essentially um what this means is that every time you create a new assignment
31:00
it is actually going to also appear on the stream tab not just the classwork tab
31:05
here you can show deleted items this would be only for teachers to be able to access here you can also add a classroom
31:12
meet link so because i am using my personal gmail account and not the
31:18
google workspace for education account you'll see that i don't have permission to create or edit a google meet link
31:25
but this is where you would be able to have your own google meet link for your students to be able to access so if you
31:32
needed to have a virtual meeting with students a virtual class with students you could actually launch that through
31:37
google classroom which i think is a really handy feature then down here below that we also have a grading tab so
31:44
here you'll see we have the grading calculations so essentially this section here says overall grade calculation
31:49
choose a grading system and basically you can choose to provide students with an overall grade um based off of that
31:57
that gradebook that we were looking at so you can do total points or weighted by category and then if you want
32:03
students to be able to see their overall grade you could turn this feature on
32:08
if you would like because i have this set to no overall grade i'm not able to make that adjustment but if i switch it
32:13
to total points you'll see that students would actually be able to see their overall grade for their for the class so
32:19
that's kind of up to you a feature that you can choose to turn on if you think it makes sense for your students and
32:25
then you can also add some different grade categories as well so i'm going to go ahead and click on the save button
Outro
32:31
and we've gone through most of the features of google classroom this was very much a beginner's tutorial just
32:37
kind of showing you what all these tabs look like if we go back to this stream tab here you'll see that this is where
32:43
it becomes that sort of stream of consciousness style that i was talking about where you'll see our assignments
32:48
that we created are here and um same with that announcement that we shared earlier so again this was a very general
32:56
overview to using google classroom if you guys have really specific questions please feel free to leave a comment in
33:02
the video description down below and i'd be happy to help answer some of the questions that you might have thank you
33:08
so much for watching today's video all about how to use google classroom if you liked this video be sure to give me a
33:14
thumbs up subscribe to my channel if you're not already i post weekly tech tutorials for teachers and i'll see you
33:19
back here soon bye friends
33:26
you

hey everyone i'm dan speda and in
0:02
today's video i'm going to show you how
0:03
to use google classroom
0:06
[Music]
0:13
so you can access google classroom by
0:15
either going to your google apps menu
0:18
or going to classroom.google.com
0:21
and if this is the first time that
0:23
you've gone to google classroom or if
0:24
you've used in the past setting up a
0:26
classroom is still fairly simple you can
0:29
begin by clicking on the plus sign in
0:31
the top right corner
0:33
and then go to create class
0:37
now depending on where you teach what
0:40
subject you teach what grade student you
0:42
teach
0:43
you can do this a few different ways so
0:46
if you're a secondary teacher you can
0:48
create a class for each separate class
0:51
that you have
0:52
if you're an elementary teacher you can
0:55
either create one class for
0:58
your whole day where you can put math
1:00
social studies science and all the
1:02
assignments and stuff in that or you can
1:04
create separate classes for each
1:07
different subject area to try to keep
1:09
things organized it's a personal
1:11
preference uh but just kind of keep that
1:13
in mind as we go through this tutorial
1:15
and what you think would be easier for
1:17
you and your students whether it's just
1:18
to put everything in one classroom or to
1:21
create different classrooms for your
1:23
students and their view will be very
1:25
similar to this view here or your view
1:27
um where you know if you had one for
1:30
science social studies math they can
1:32
just go to their google classroom and
1:33
then just click on the individual
1:34
classes
1:36
so let's set up our first class here um
1:39
we're just going to call this
1:41
tutorial
1:43
and then you can put in any additional
1:44
information that might be useful to your
1:46
class section subject room
1:49
and we'll go to create
1:52
now let's quickly uh go through all the
1:54
different things that you're seeing on
1:55
your screen because this is your class
1:57
homepage and so you'll see um on the
2:01
menu and the left
2:03
you can quickly toggle between your
2:06
classes your calendar and then any
2:09
classes that you have or belong to on
2:11
the side
2:14
up top here you have your stream so
2:16
think of your stream uh like for those
2:18
of you who are on facebook it's kind of
2:20
like your main page so when the students
2:22
come in this is what they'll see first
2:24
so any announcements or anything that
2:26
you post in your stream will be like the
2:29
first things that they see when they
2:30
come into class
2:32
so to create an announcement you simply
2:35
click where it says announce something
2:37
to your class
2:39
and uh so here you can type in either a
2:43
good morning message to the students you
2:45
can uh you know summarize their day what
2:47
it's going to look like you can link any
2:50
assignments you can put everything kind
2:52
of in one spot and again especially
2:54
depending on what age you have for your
2:56
students
2:57
this could be used in several different
2:59
ways
3:00
but a couple important things about the
3:02
announcement is down here you can change
3:05
between bold italic underline you can
3:07
bullet so that it is uh visually really
3:10
easy for the kids to see things and you
3:13
can remove the formatting if you're
3:14
copying and pasting or anything like
3:15
that you can link things directly from
3:18
your google drive
3:19
you can upload files from your computer
3:23
you can add in links to different sites
3:26
and you can add youtube videos uh so
3:28
let's just click on add youtube videos
3:30
you can actually search in youtube so
3:33
let's look up the best youtube channel
3:36
out there let's type in the ed tech show
3:39
and here are a bunch of different videos
3:41
so let's say we want to tell them how to
3:43
see their students while they're
3:44
presenting in google me simply click add
3:47
video
3:48
and now that will be linked in my
3:50
announcements if i wanted to send them
3:52
to a website so we'll click here and
3:55
then we'll say
3:57
national geographic kids we can put the
4:00
link into there
4:02
add link and that will also be in there
4:04
i can upload any files so if i had a
4:06
picture that i wanted to put in there
4:09
we could upload a picture
4:11
so this was from another video that i
4:13
made
4:14
and again if you want to link something
4:16
from your google drive you can just
4:17
click on that
4:18
and we can put our back to school slides
4:21
on there
4:22
and you can write like i said any
4:24
message up here
4:26
now something to keep in mind is up top
4:28
here you can actually um decide what
4:31
classes you want to uh post this
4:34
announcement in so you might have seven
4:36
different classes and you want to do the
4:39
same announcement for those other
4:41
classes instead of having to go to each
4:42
class to do it you can just click up
4:45
here and select all the classes that you
4:47
want to publish that in
4:51
and you can decide what students you
4:54
want to see this message so you can
4:56
either click all students now this is
4:58
just a test classroom that i'm using for
4:59
this um but if you had all of your
5:02
students listed you can click on the
5:05
individual students so you could
5:07
customize this which is a really nice
5:09
way to differentiate without the
5:10
students even knowing that that's what
5:12
you're doing because they'll only see
5:13
what you allow them to see in the things
5:15
that you post for them
5:17
so let's just post this so you get an
5:19
idea of what that looks like
5:21
and so you see that now it's a nice
5:23
condensed uh announcement that has
5:25
everything that i need the students to
5:27
see here and you can have instructions
5:28
for what you want them to do with
5:30
everything that you've linked
5:32
now we mentioned uh the students so
5:36
let's click on people we'll come back to
5:37
classwork in a second
5:39
so here is where you can add uh the
5:42
different code teachers that you might
5:44
have in your class or any administrators
5:46
that want access to your class uh and
5:48
your students
5:50
so there's three different ways to
5:52
populate your class when you click on
5:55
the um the person with the plus sign you
5:59
have an invite link that you can share
6:02
with your students so
6:03
if you wanted to email this you can
6:06
email that to your students by just
6:08
clicking
6:09
copy invite link and you can send it out
6:12
by email
6:13
you can type their name or email address
6:16
um so that i'm just gonna put you know
6:23
i can type in you if i wanted to invite
6:25
the ed tech show i can invite that and
6:27
when i click invite they'll receive an
6:29
email that will have a link in it all i
6:31
have to do is click on the link and then
6:33
it will put them in the class now if you
6:35
are in a student directory
6:38
or a school directory you can start to
6:40
begin to type their names and you'll see
6:42
their email addresses and then you can
6:44
just click on it and again you can do
6:45
this for
6:46
your entire class you can just kind of
6:48
type their names and then just do it all
6:50
at once
6:52
you can give them the class code which
6:54
is available in the banner on your uh
6:57
stream on the main page there so if
6:59
you're in class you can just write that
7:00
on the board and when they go into uh
7:04
classroom.google.com
7:05
and click that plus button they can join
7:08
using a code and they would just type
7:10
that code in
7:12
or one of the new updates allows your it
7:15
department to populate your classes from
7:19
your student information system uh that
7:21
is a little bit more complicated and
7:23
that needs to work through your
7:25
tech department but just know that that
7:27
is an option that has just become made
7:29
available this summer so if your school
7:32
or district is set up to do that they
7:34
can actually just populate it uh all the
7:36
classes at one time
7:38
now once you've added other teachers
7:40
they will be able to
7:42
assign different class work make
7:44
announcements and do all that stuff as
7:47
well so this works well if you have any
7:49
paraprofessionals if you have any
7:50
special services like ell or um you know
7:54
special education people that are in
7:56
your working with students in your class
7:58
they can hop in and see all the work
8:00
they can go and they can uh add extra
8:02
assignments for the kids or resources
8:04
for them which works out really nicely
8:08
under the classwork tab uh you have a
8:11
few different options so this is where
8:14
you'll assign your uh work to the
8:17
students
8:18
and it's important before you get
8:20
started to start thinking about how you
8:23
want to set up your classwork because
8:25
you can begin to just create assignments
8:30
and when you click create you have some
8:32
choices here so you can create an
8:34
assignment a quiz assignment a question
8:37
you can post materials or you can reuse
8:39
posts so if you have
8:41
classes that you've used in the past you
8:43
can reuse them
8:45
a question would be
8:47
something that's open-ended so you can
8:50
type out something for the student so
8:51
you could say
8:53
you know something about your lesson
8:54
something about their homework and you
8:56
can actually have a nice discussion that
8:59
evolves underneath
9:01
so i could just say you know what
9:04
did you
9:06
learn from
9:09
today's class
9:11
another instruction i can write what was
9:13
one thing you learned
9:17
and you can decide whether it's a short
9:18
answer or you can leave multiple choice
9:21
if you wanted to insert any other
9:23
materials you can do that as well
9:25
and just like before when we were making
9:28
posts you can decide
9:30
what classes this question is going to
9:32
get asked in
9:34
which students will see this
9:37
and then down here you can decide
9:39
whether or not students can reply to
9:41
each other so
9:42
here you could do a bunch of different
9:44
things you could have um you could even
9:45
say you know reply to two students you
9:49
could say you could have a debate you
9:51
can do lots of different things where
9:52
the students are responding to each
9:54
other and depending on the age of your
9:56
students you can kind of get into some
9:57
of the digital citizenship stuff with
9:59
you know um
10:00
some manners some really what's what's
10:03
polite what's root how do you respond in
10:05
a digital format all that stuff and you
10:08
can also either have the students lock
10:10
in their answers or you can allow them
10:12
to go back and edit
10:15
uh we'll talk about topics in a second
10:18
you can assign a due date and you can
10:20
assign points
10:24
so let's go to ask just so you can kind
10:26
of see what this looks like
10:28
and you'll see now under classwork you
10:30
have the question icon and then you have
10:33
the post this is what did you learn from
10:35
today's class
10:38
and as the students answer you'll see um
10:41
you know the numbers here that show how
10:42
many it was assigned to how many have
10:44
turned it in and then you'll be able to
10:46
see all of their answers
10:48
and you can see the question as you
10:50
asked it and you can even go in and edit
10:52
so if you said oh man i made a mistake i
10:54
really wish i had done this you can kind
10:56
of say you know i didn't give enough as
10:58
instructions please respond to two
11:01
classmates
11:03
and then save and it will change for the
11:05
students
11:07
so now let's go back um to our classwork
11:10
tab
11:11
and let's go and create um a new
11:14
assignment
11:16
so this would be uh in you know your
11:18
kind of day-to-day stuff you know you've
11:20
got something you want the students to
11:21
do
11:22
you can just do the same way that you
11:24
set up that question that i just did
11:27
let's just call it um
11:29
chapter
11:31
one
11:33
where the red fern grows
11:36
and so now you can put down the
11:38
instructions you know you could say read
11:39
pages you know one to
11:41
27 uh and answer the following questions
11:44
and you can link in any work that you
11:47
might have so if you've got like a
11:48
worksheet in google docs or something in
11:50
your google drive you can create that
11:53
and put that in here so let me just add
11:54
something in google drive here
11:56
so i've just added in a google doc and
12:00
uh over next that you'll see students
12:02
can view file you can change this to
12:05
students can edit the file which would
12:06
mean there's one copy for all of your
12:08
students that everybody's editing
12:10
or you can go down to where it says make
12:11
a copy for each student and then when
12:14
each student opens up this assignment it
12:16
will create a separate doc
12:19
for each one over here on the right side
12:22
same as before you can decide what
12:23
classes this is assigned to which
12:25
students
12:26
uh how many points what the due date is
12:29
so i can come in and say this is due
12:30
tomorrow
12:33
and again we haven't talked about topics
12:34
yet but we'll talk about that in a
12:35
second you can also create a rubric um
12:39
so we won't create a full one right now
12:42
but just know that this option exists so
12:44
that you can have a full rubric that you
12:47
can grade right in google classroom
12:50
which allows you to uh pull up the
12:52
assignment as the student works on it
12:54
and then grade it right in using the
12:56
rubric
13:00
and then there's also originality
13:02
reports um that you can check for
13:04
plagiarism and so let's just click
13:07
assign
13:10
so you can begin to see what our google
13:12
classroom is going to look like
13:14
so you see for the students when they go
13:17
into classwork they're gonna see they've
13:19
got an assignment uh which you see the
13:22
assignment icon here
13:23
and then you see the question down here
13:26
and these are
13:28
things that they have to do now i
13:29
mentioned the topics topics is a way to
13:32
organize this classwork so let's call
13:35
this topic let's say there's reading
13:41
let's say
13:45
there's science
13:53
and let's say there's math so this would
13:55
be let's say you set up your classroom
13:57
in a way where you're a primary teacher
14:00
and you want to have all of your
14:02
assignments in one place here you can
14:04
start to sort things to have them make
14:07
sense for the students and you can
14:09
actually move your assignments around
14:12
by just clicking and dragging so now
14:14
you've got math what'd you learn from
14:15
today's class um you know oops this
14:18
should go under reading so you put that
14:20
under reading and now uh you know you're
14:23
beginning to get a little bit more
14:24
organized
14:26
you can also delete these
14:30
or you can rename them so something else
14:33
to think about if you're teaching
14:34
virtually or if you're trying to
14:36
organize your uh your stream here your
14:40
classwork page
14:42
chronologically you could say you know
14:45
this is
14:47
work
14:48
for week
14:50
9 6 2 9 10
14:55
and then you kind of go back and you can
14:56
rename all these if you just create
14:59
something
15:01
and you don't give it a topic
15:05
so let's just call this
15:07
unit quiz
15:10
and let's say we created a whole google
15:12
form here for our quiz and we assign it
15:16
it will just put anything that you don't
15:18
assign a topic to above where you have
15:21
the topics
15:23
so it's just something to think about
15:24
it's easy to um if you begin organizing
15:28
right from the beginning it doesn't
15:29
become overwhelming
15:31
another thing i've seen teachers do
15:32
which i think is kind of cool is when
15:33
they're creating assignments
15:35
they'll rename them or they'll name them
15:38
and they'll use emojis um in the
15:40
beginning so they'll put like you know
15:42
maybe a pencil if it's a writing
15:44
assignment or they'll put um you know
15:46
like a two-person emoji if it's group
15:48
work so it's just a way for students to
15:51
visually look down and they can kind of
15:53
identify what the work is
15:57
and then uh from the grades again i
15:58
don't have anything in here because this
16:00
is just a tutorial that i created
16:02
but this will show you uh the students
16:05
and their grades and their assignments
16:07
so once you start populating those
16:09
assignments and the students are
16:10
completing it this grades page will
16:12
start to fill out
16:16
now one of the really nice things that
16:17
google added last year was a google meet
16:22
that is generated right in your banner
16:24
so to customize your banner you can do
16:26
that a couple different ways
16:28
let's first uh generate a meet link
16:32
so our class will have a unique
16:35
and you can make that visible to
16:37
students which means they can see uh the
16:39
link at the top but you can also hide
16:41
that so if you go up to the gear up top
16:44
here your settings gear
16:45
this will let you change any of your
16:47
class details
16:49
uh you can manage your invite codes
16:51
so those are what i showed you um in the
16:53
beginning and how to get your students
16:55
uh logged in you can decide whether or
16:58
not your students can post and comment
17:00
on your stream so i always like letting
17:02
the students comment uh kind of gets
17:03
them excited let them just be
17:05
interactive especially if you're
17:06
teaching virtually but if you wanted so
17:08
they couldn't uh comment or post you can
17:11
make it so only teachers can post or
17:12
comment
17:14
uh there's different options for the
17:16
classwork on the stream showing
17:18
attachments or you can show the
17:19
condensed notifications or hide
17:20
notifications you can show deleted items
17:24
uh you can send guardian summaries so an
17:27
example of this is what the parents see
17:31
so this you know it depends parents
17:33
can't necessarily join your google
17:35
classroom but guardians parents and
17:38
guardians can get summaries of the
17:40
assignments
17:41
so i'll show you how to add that in a
17:44
second
17:45
you can also
17:46
decide whether or not that link as i
17:48
mentioned is that link is visible to
17:51
students by toggling this
17:54
and then you can also change your
17:57
grading calculations so that it's points
17:59
or you can do weighted categories
18:02
and then you can add in the category so
18:04
if you wanted weighted categories you
18:06
can decide you know what um
18:08
what percentage or how many points go to
18:10
each
18:11
uh different category so it's
18:13
essentially like setting up your grade
18:15
book that you would do in you know
18:16
whatever your student information uh
18:18
software is whether it's power school or
18:20
infinite campus or something else uh
18:22
it's setting it up just like that
18:25
and uh i mentioned the banner up top you
18:28
can change that you know you can select
18:30
themes uh there's a bunch that are
18:32
already in here you can upload your own
18:35
uh pictures and videos i know a lot of
18:38
people like to use their uh their
18:40
bitmojis so if you have a bitmoji banner
18:43
you can do that as well by just clicking
18:44
on upload photo uh and then kind of
18:47
customizing it to how you want it to
18:49
look
18:50
so as i mentioned earlier there is a way
18:53
to invite guardians to get those emails
18:56
now you'll see from this page uh which i
18:58
have blurred out all the personal
19:00
information but next to
19:03
um the students once they've accepted
19:05
the invite and they're in your class you
19:06
can click where it says invite guardians
19:09
and then you can type in their email
19:11
address and it will send them a link
19:14
that allows them to be able to receive
19:15
those uh those updated summaries that i
19:19
showed you
19:20
before in the options setting of your
19:22
classroom
19:24
one last thing to show you is when you
19:26
click on calendar
19:28
once you start making assignments those
19:30
will show up in your google calendar and
19:33
they'll show up in your students google
19:34
calendar as well so it's a really nice
19:37
way to stay organized with all of your
19:38
assignments and as the students go
19:40
through depending on uh you know how
19:42
many assignments they have from
19:43
different teachers and different classes
19:45
it's a nice way for them to stay
19:47
organized and visually see all the work
19:49
they have to do for each day
19:51
one of the things that i really love
19:52
about google classroom is that it's a
19:54
versatile tool that can be used for
19:56
students of any age and in any subject
19:58
area and you as a teacher can use in any
20:01
way that you feel comfortable
20:03
while there are more advanced features
20:05
to google classroom you can get through
20:07
an entire year just using the basics
20:09
that i showed you in this video today
20:12
so if you were to take a full year and
20:14
just do the assignments do those
20:16
questions where you're kind of getting
20:18
students talking and engage with each
20:20
other using that class stream for
20:22
announcements uh you will be completely
20:25
fine you can add the parents in they'll
20:27
get uh the summaries of all the work and
20:29
what their students have to still do and
20:31
uh you will be on your way and as you
20:33
kind of work through it i'm sure you'll
20:35
start to add things in because it'll
20:37
things will just feel a little bit more
20:38
intuitive and you'll become more
20:40
comfortable um but you got this as a
20:43
teacher if you're especially if you're
20:44
virtual or if you're in the classroom
20:46
you can use this however fits like your
20:49
needs
20:50
and if you don't have any teachers that
20:51
might benefit from watching this video
20:53

20:57

In today's video, I'm going to be giving
0:01
you a Google Classroom tutorial for
0:03
beginners. If you find this video
0:05
useful, please be sure to like and
0:06
subscribe, and let's get right into it.
0:08
Let's begin by accessing Google
0:10
Classroom. To start, open your preferred
0:12
web browser and go to the Google
0:14
Classroom homepage. If you haven't used
0:15
Google Classroom before, you'll
0:17
recognize it by its clean and intuitive
0:19
interface, which is designed to make
0:21
managing classes simple and
0:22
straightforward. Once you're on the
0:24
homepage, the next step is to sign into
0:26
your account. Look to the top right
0:28
corner of the page and you'll spot the
0:30
sign in button. Click on it and you'll
0:32
be prompted to enter your Google account
0:34
credentials. If you're a student, make
0:36
sure you're using the email address
0:37
provided by your school to ensure you
0:39
have access to all your classes and
0:40
materials. After successfully logging
0:42
in, you'll be greeted by the home tab,
0:44
which serves as your central dashboard.
0:46
This is where you'll find an overview of
0:48
all your activities, upcoming
0:50
assignments, and important
0:51
announcements. The home tab is designed
0:53
to give you a snapshot of what's
0:55
happening in your classes, helping you
0:56
stay organized and on top of your work.
0:59
Take a moment to familiarize yourself
1:00
with this area as it will be the first
1:02
place you check whenever you log into
1:04
Google Classroom. At the top of the home
1:06
tab, you'll notice the main menu. This
1:08
menu is a powerful feature that allows
1:10
you to toggle your side panel, giving
1:12
you quick access to various sections of
1:14
Google Classroom. The side panel is
1:16
where you'll navigate between different
1:17
tabs and tools that Google Classroom
1:20
offers. Understanding how to use this
1:22
menu effectively will enhance your
1:24
overall experience, making it easier to
1:26
switch between classes and access
1:28
different features without any hassle.
1:30
One of the key features available
1:32
through the main menu is the calendar.
1:34
By clicking on the calendar, you can
1:35
view your schedule and see all your
1:37
classes laid out in a monthly format.
1:39
This is incredibly useful for keeping
1:40
track of deadlines, upcoming exams, and
1:43
scheduled classes. The calendar helps
1:45
you visualize your month ahead, ensuring
1:47
you never miss an important date. You
1:49
can also sync this calendar with your
1:50
personal calendar app, allowing you to
1:52
manage your time more efficiently across
1:54
different platforms. Next, let's explore
1:56
the teaching section within Google
1:58
Classroom. By clicking on teaching, you
2:00
gain access to your scheduled teaching
2:02
classes and a variety of files,
2:04
including assignments and projects. This
2:06
section is the hub for all the resources
2:08
you need to manage your classes
2:09
effectively. Whether you're preparing a
2:12
new assignment or reviewing student
2:13
submissions, the teaching section
2:15
provides all the tools you need in one
2:17
convenient location. Here, organization
2:20
is key, and Google Classroom makes it
2:22
easy to keep everything sorted and
2:23
accessible. Within the teaching section,
2:25
you'll find two important tabs, to
2:27
review and reviewed. The to review tab
2:30
gives you an overview of your files that
2:31
are pending review, allowing you to
2:33
prioritize which assignments need your
2:35
attention first. This is especially
2:37
helpful when dealing with a large number
2:39
of submissions as it helps you manage
2:41
your time and workload more effectively.
2:43
On the other hand, the reviewed tab lets
2:45
you see all the work you've already
2:46
evaluated, providing a clear record of
2:48
your feedback and grades. This feature
2:50
ensures that you can easily refer back
2:52
to past assignments and maintain
2:54
consistency in your grading. Now, let's
2:57
dive deeper into your classes. By
2:59
clicking on your specific class, you'll
3:00
be taken to a detailed view of
3:02
everything related to that particular
3:04
course. This is where you'll find all
3:06
the essential information and tools
3:07
needed to manage and participate in your
3:10
class. In this detailed view, you'll see
3:12
several tabs, including stream,
3:14
classwork, people, and grades. Each of
3:16
these tabs serves a unique purpose,
3:18
helping you organize your class content,
3:20
communicate with students or teachers,
3:22
and keep track of performance. Starting
3:25
with the stream tab, this is where
3:26
you'll find the most recent
3:27
announcements, upcoming work reminders,
3:29
and the class banner. The stream acts as
3:32
a communication hub, allowing teachers
3:33
to post updates and share important
3:35
information with students. It's also a
3:38
place where students can interact by
3:39
posting comments or questions, fostering
3:42
a collaborative learning environment.
3:44
The stream ensures that everyone stays
3:46
informed and engaged with the class
3:48
activities. Moving on to the classwork
3:50
tab. This is where the bulk of your
3:52
assignments and projects are managed. In
3:54
this section, you can easily create new
3:56
assignments, upload resources, and
3:58
organize them by topic or unit. The
4:01
classwork tab is designed to keep all
4:03
your educational materials in one place,
4:05
making it easy for students to find and
4:07
complete their work. For teachers, this
4:10
means streamlined assignment creation
4:11
and distribution, while students benefit
4:14
from a clear and organized layout that
4:15
helps them keep track of their tasks.
4:17
The people tab is another crucial part
4:19
of Google Classroom. Here you can
4:21
invite, manage, and view all the
4:23
students and teachers involved in your
4:24
class. This tab provides a comprehensive
4:26
list of everyone participating, allowing
4:29
for easy communication and
4:30
collaboration. Teachers can add new
4:32
students or co-teers, ensuring that
4:34
everyone who needs access to the class
4:36
has it. For students, the people tab
4:38
offers a quick way to see who else is in
4:40
the class, facilitating group work and
4:42
peer support. Grades are managed through
4:44
the grades tab, where you can view and
4:46
track the performance of each student.
4:48
This section allows you to enter and
4:50
update grades for assignments, providing
4:52
a transparent and accessible grading
4:54
system. The grades tab not only helps
4:56
teachers keep track of student progress,
4:58
but also allow students to monitor their
5:00
own performance, encouraging self-
5:02
assessment and improvement. At the top
5:04
right corner of your class view, you'll
5:06
find additional tools such as the
5:07
calendar, drive, and settings. The
5:10
calendar integration allows for seamless
5:12
synchronization of class schedules and
5:14
deadlines, ensuring that all important
5:17
dates are easily accessible. The Drive
5:19
link provides quick access to any files
5:21
or resources stored in Google Drive,
5:23
making it simple to find and use
5:25
documents related to your class. The
5:27
settings option offers various
5:28
customization and management tools,
5:30
giving you control over how your class
5:32
is organized and functions. Customizing
5:34
your class is an essential part of
5:36
creating a productive learning
5:37
environment. Through the settings menu,
5:40
you can adjust various aspects of your
5:41
class, such as class name, section,
5:44
subject, and room. You can also manage
5:46
permissions, control who can post on the
5:49
stream, and set up other preferences
5:51
that tailor the classroom experience to
5:53
your specific needs. This level of
5:55
customization ensures that your class is
5:58
organized in a way that best supports
5:59
your teaching style and student
6:01
engagement. In the stream tab, you'll
6:03
notice the class code, which is a unique
6:05
identifier for your class. This code is
6:07
useful for inviting new students or
6:09
teachers to join the class.
6:11
Additionally, the stream displays
6:12
upcoming work and reminders, helping
6:14
everyone stay on track with their
6:16
assignments and deadlines. The class
6:18
banner you see at the top serves as a
6:20
visual identifier, making your class
6:22
easily recognizable among others. The
6:25
classwork tab is where you can manage
6:26
all your assignments. Creating a new
6:28
assignment is straightforward.
6:32
So, simply click on the create button.
6:34
Choose the type of assignment you want
6:36
to create and fill in the necessary
6:38
details. You can attach files, add
6:40
links, set due dates, and even include
6:43
instructions to guide your students.
6:45
This feature not only streamlines the
6:46
assignment distribution process, but
6:48
also enhances the clarity and
6:50
organization of your class materials. In
6:52
the people tab, managing your class
6:54
members is a breeze. You can invite new
6:57
students by sending them an invitation
6:58
link or manually adding them using their
7:01
email addresses. Additionally, you can
7:03
assign roles such as adding co-teers who
7:05
can help manage the class alongside you.
7:08
This collaborative feature ensures that
7:09
managing larger classes or multiple
7:11
sections remains efficient and
7:13
effective. The grades tab offers a
7:15
comprehensive view of student
7:17
performance. Here you can enter grades
7:19
for each assignment, providing immediate
7:21
feedback to students. The grading
7:23
interface is userfriendly, allowing you
7:25
to quickly navigate between different
7:26
assignments and update scores as needed.
7:29
This real-time grading system helps
7:31
maintain transparency and keep students
7:33
informed about their progress throughout
7:35
the course. Switching gears to the
7:37
student perspective, let's explore the
7:39
enrolled tab. As a student, the enrolled
7:41
tab allows you to view all the classes
7:42
you're currently enrolled in. This
7:44
organized list ensures that you can
7:46
easily access each of your courses
7:48
without confusion. Within this tab,
7:50
you'll find the to-do section, which
7:52
categorizes your tasks into assigned,
7:54
missing, and done. This categorization
7:57
helps you prioritize your work, ensuring
7:59
that you stay on top of your assignments
8:00
and manage your time effectively. In the
8:03
to-do tab, the assign section lists all
8:05
the tasks that have been given to you
8:06
but are not yet completed. This is where
8:09
you can see what needs to be done next
8:10
and plan your study schedule
8:12
accordingly. The missing section
8:13
highlights any assignments that you may
8:15
have overlooked or not yet started,
8:17
reminding you to catch up on your work.
8:19
Lastly, the done section showcases all
8:21
the tasks you've completed, giving you a
8:23
sense of accomplishment and a clear
8:25
record of your achievements. When you
8:27
click on one of your enrolled classes,
8:29
you'll gain access to the stream,
8:31
classwork, and people tabs specific to
8:33
that class. This allows you to engage
8:35
with class updates, access assignments
8:38
and resources, and interact with your
8:40
classmates and teachers. The seamless
8:42
navigation between these sections
8:43
ensures that you have all the tools you
8:45
need to succeed in your courses right at
8:47
your fingertips. Below your enrolled
8:49
classes, you'll find your archived
8:51
classes. This feature allows you to
8:53
manage classes that you are no longer
8:54
actively participating in. Whether you
8:56
need to move, copy, restore, or delete
8:58
an archived class, the archived classes
9:00
section provides the necessary controls
9:02
to manage your course history. This is
9:04
particularly useful for maintaining a
9:06
clean and organized dashboard, ensuring
9:08
that only your current and relevant
9:10
classes are prominently displayed.
9:12
Configuring your settings is an
9:13
important step to personalize your
9:15
experience on Google Classroom. By
9:17
clicking on the settings option at the
9:19
bottom of the main menu, you can adjust
9:21
your classroom notifications and account
9:23
settings. This includes how and when you
9:25
receive updates about assignments,
9:27
comments, and other activities.
9:29
Tailoring these settings helps you stay
9:30
informed without feeling overwhelmed by
9:32
constant notifications, allowing you to
9:35
focus on your studies or teaching
9:36
responsibilities effectively. At the top
9:39
right corner of the Google Classroom
9:41
interface, you'll find your profile
9:42
photo. Clicking on it gives you access
9:45
to manage your Google account. From
9:47
here, you can update your personal
9:48
information, change your password, and
9:51
adjust other account related settings.
9:53
This centralized access ensures that you
9:56
have full control over your account
9:58
security and personalization, keeping
10:00
your information up to date and secure.
10:03
Next to your profile photo, you'll see
10:05
the Google Apps menu toggle. This menu
10:08
provides quick access to a wide range of
10:09
Google services such as Google Drive,
10:12
Gmail, Google Calendar, and more. The
10:15
apps menu is a powerful feature that
10:16
allows you to switch between different
10:18
Google tools without leaving Google
10:20
Classroom. This integration streamlines
10:22
your workflow, making it easier to use
10:24
multiple Google services in conjunction
10:26
with your classroom activities. At the
10:28
bottom right of the Google Classroom
10:30
interface, you'll notice a question mark
10:32
icon. This icon represents the support
10:34
feature, providing access to help and
10:36
resources if you encounter any issues or
10:38
have questions about using Google
10:40
Classroom. Whether you need
10:41
troubleshooting assistance or want to
10:43
learn more about specific features, the
10:45
support option offers valuable guidance
10:47
to ensure your experience remains smooth
10:49
and productive. Throughout this
10:51
tutorial, we've covered the essential
10:52
aspects of Google Classroom. From
10:54
signing in and navigating the dashboard
10:56
to managing classes, assignments, and
10:58
settings. By understanding and utilizing
11:00
these features, you can create a more
11:02
organized and efficient educational
11:04
environment. Whether you're teaching or
11:05
learning, Google Classroom's intuitive
11:08
design and robust tools make it an
11:10
invaluable resource for enhancing the
11:12
educational experience in 2025 and
11:15
beyond. Remember, the key to mastering
11:17
Google Classroom is to explore and
11:19
practice using its various features.

hi there jamie key here today at
0:02
teachers tech today i want to show you
0:03
how to set up
0:04
and manage your google classroom i want
0:07
to show it from the teacher view
0:08
and also to show you what the students
0:11
will see in this
0:12
so let's get started with google
0:13
classroom today here on teachers tech
0:19
to see what's included in this video
0:21
just take a look at the description down
0:22
below
0:23
i'm also going to put time stamps which
0:24
allow you to jump to different parts of
0:26
this video so if you're looking for
0:27
something specific just click on the
0:29
number and it will jump to that part of
0:30
the video
0:31
so but now let's just start with how to
How to access Google Classroom
0:33
access our google classroom and there's
0:35
a few different ways to do this
0:37
now the way i tend to go is just going
0:40
up
0:40
to the uh up to top to the google launch
0:43
here
0:43
these nine little squares the apps and
0:46
you can see google classroom is right
0:48
here
0:48
and if you have it lower down remember
0:50
you can drag these all around so if it's
0:52
something you're accessing quite a bit
0:54
you can go ahead and do that way and
0:56
then just go and click on it
0:58
and it will open up google classroom the
1:00
thing i wanted to point out
1:01
right here is you could just type if
1:04
you're logged in and i was already
1:05
logged in
1:06
to my account so you do need to be
1:08
logged in to access google classroom
1:11
but you can see classroom.google.com
1:13
will get you to the same place too so
1:15
you could type that in
1:17
the other way how i like to do this is
1:19
and something to note
1:20
is whether you're on ios or android just
1:24
simply
1:25
open up install the app on your um
1:28
on your on your phone and then you'll be
1:30
able to do all the same things that i
1:31
show you
1:32
on a computer you'll be able to do the
1:34
exact same thing on your app and this
1:36
works very
1:38
very good to be adding information by
1:41
just having your phone so check out that
1:42
app too
1:43
but now so we have our google classroom
1:46
here
1:46
and the first thing that we're going to
1:48
do is just to create a class
Create and edit a class in Google Classroom
1:50
and you can see right up here where the
1:53
plus symbol is create or join a class so
1:55
this is where students are going to join
1:57
the class here
1:58
and this is where we're going to create
1:59
our class so i'm just going to create a
2:01
class here
2:02
i'm going to go create class and at this
2:05
point i'm just going to
2:07
name it teachers tech and we'll just
2:09
call this demo
2:11
and go ahead and hit create you can fill
2:13
out sections
2:14
subjects room you can go back and edit
2:17
this at all times too
2:19
but i'm just going to go ahead and hit
2:20
create so we have a class to work with
2:23
and it will create this class and then
2:25
after it's created
2:27
all that we're going to do is make some
2:28
changes inside of it
2:30
now this is pretty much you know you're
2:32
going to see all your classes look this
2:33
way
2:34
but we can customize this too and if you
2:36
want to start
2:37
at the beginning to customize or you can
2:39
do this later too you can see how
2:41
there's a picture right here
2:42
well we can go and select a theme or
2:45
upload a photo so maybe you want to put
2:46
a photo of your class or whatever it is
2:49
you can upload a photo but if i just go
2:51
and select theme
2:52
you can see i can go through and pick
2:54
kind of a general theme like this i
2:56
could go to english or history
2:59
i'll just go back to general you can
3:00
look at different ones on it
3:02
i'm just going to go ahead and pick this
3:05
one right here
3:06
and i'm going to hit select theme and
3:08
you get to see how the
3:09
theme changes now when we're magic
3:12
managing google classroom
3:13
take a look up top right here you can
3:16
see
3:17
where these three lines are we can go
3:19
back to our classes i'll explain some of
3:21
these things a little bit later
3:23
but if i go to classes this is the class
3:25
that we just created and this is where
3:27
they're all going to get created as you
3:29
create more classes
3:30
there's going to be more to fill in here
3:33
and you can see
3:34
if i click these three little dots here
3:36
we can edit
3:37
we can go back and click the edit and
3:39
change uh
3:40
this part right here what i showed you
3:42
before on it
3:43
and if you go back where you can copy
3:45
and archive also
3:46
so now that we have a class set up let's
3:48
start looking at what else we can do
Add students to your Google Classroom
3:50
with it
3:51
okay so for this section i want to show
3:53
you how you can add
3:54
students to your class i'm going to go
3:57
back
3:57
into my class that i created here and at
4:00
this point now
4:01
the way i usually do it in front of a
4:03
class if i have this open and showing
4:05
them
4:05
you see there's this class code right
4:08
here
4:08
and what i can be doing if they're live
4:10
in front of me i'm just going to hit
4:12
this little display
4:13
and i just tell them to type down this
4:15
code and then they can join the class
4:17
remember at the beginning they would
4:18
have to hit the join then enter this
4:20
code
4:21
the other way i could do i could just
4:24
copy
4:24
copy this class code and send in an
4:27
email
4:28
from here and if you don't like this
4:30
class code
4:31
what you can do is go over to the
4:33
settings here
4:35
and if i scroll down for a little bit
4:37
you can see that there's the class code
4:39
here it is right here
4:40
same one if i click on this one i could
4:43
copy it from here too but i can reset it
4:45
if you want a different one or i can
4:47
even disable it if i don't want any more
4:49
students to come
4:50
in so remember that in this setting so
4:53
i'm just going to go
4:53
out of this one the other way that
4:56
you can do this and this gives an
4:58
invitation to the students if i go
5:00
up to people up here and you can see
5:04
their students
5:05
and this is where i would invite other
5:06
teachers so if you are collaborating
5:08
there's another teacher that you're
5:09
working with in this class you can add
5:11
them here
5:12
but if we're adding students if i go
5:14
ahead and hit the plus here
5:16
and i'm just going to start typing
5:19
this so we have a demo one here and i'm
5:21
going to give an invite
5:23
and then that student will get an invite
5:25
in their email then they'll have to
5:27
click it
5:28
and then they'll be accepted from it and
5:30
then we'll have students
5:31
in our class so what does it look like
Showing how students join a class
5:35
for the student
5:36
well there's a couple different ways
5:38
they're going to get in their email a
5:39
place to join
5:40
but the other thing once you invite them
5:42
through the invite process
5:44
they'll get this so right now i'm logged
5:46
in as one of the students i invited
5:48
and you can see they can either decline
5:50
or join now the
5:52
other way i mentioned now that you can
5:54
see it's joining and this person's part
5:56
of that class
5:58
now if i go over and go to a different
6:01
one the other way to join
6:02
is if i hit the plus and then that's
6:05
where the class
6:06
code is entered so that's where i would
6:08
enter the class code that
6:10
i had that was being displayed i could
6:13
either send that or just show it in
6:14
class and hit join
6:16
and then that person will be part of the
6:18
class so those are the different ways
6:20
the students can join the class and what
6:22
they're going to see through that
6:23
process
Invite guardians and email students
6:25
so now i'm back in my teachers account
6:28
here and you can see now
6:29
they're not grayed out anymore these
6:31
people have excite
6:33
accepted and i can invite guardians now
6:36
so i can click on this and i can put in
6:38
the emails of the guardians
6:39
and then they'll they'll get they'll get
6:42
a place to sign up to be able to say how
6:44
often they want to
6:46
see the information knowing when
6:48
assignments are and you can also
6:50
email students from right here so if i
6:52
click these three little dots i can go
6:53
to email students
6:55
and i can send them a direct message
6:58
from here so it makes this an easy way
6:59
to manage everything
7:01
right inside google classroom
Communicating in the Stream in Google Classroom with student view
7:04
so i'm back in the teachers site now
7:07
and i want to discuss the stream now the
7:09
stream is going to be
7:10
your first tab here and it's what you're
7:13
going to see down below
7:14
here now this is where you communicate
7:17
with your class you're not going to be
7:18
giving assignments in the stream it's
7:20
going to be maybe announcements and you
7:22
can give attachments of files to things
7:24
from google drive
7:26
or a website or even a youtube video
7:29
so to do this you what you can do is
7:31
just click in
7:32
here and i'll just say that
7:35
welcome just give a welcome message so
7:38
i'll just say welcome
7:40
and this would go out to now we have a
7:43
couple options do you want it to go out
7:45
to
7:45
all students or do you want to go to
7:48
select students so you can choose if
7:50
this is uh
7:51
going to everybody or select students
7:54
now this is where you can add
7:56
so right down here we can go add and do
7:59
we want this to be a link a file a
8:01
youtube video so if i was going to go
8:03
to maybe a google drive it would open up
8:06
something in my google drive
8:08
and i'll just grab a
8:11
video from my google drive on this one
8:14
so now
8:15
i have one more option here i can go
8:18
here
8:18
i can schedule it or save it as a draft
8:20
which means i can go back later and post
8:22
it but i'm just going to go ahead
8:24
and post this and let's move over to
8:27
the view what the student would see on
8:29
this one right now
8:31
so now i'm logged in as one of the
8:33
students and this is
8:34
their view so it's not changing a lot on
8:36
this one but now
8:37
students can comment back on this one
8:40
too
8:41
and notice they can write something up
8:43
here also
8:44
now i'll show you in a moment you might
8:46
not want to give that much
8:48
opportunity for students to write right
8:50
away maybe you want to kind of teach
8:51
them about it and what to kind of
8:53
the appropriate things to communicate in
8:55
here and i'll show you where that option
8:57
is
8:57
but if a student was i'll just say wow
9:01
and was to write something here and then
9:03
send it back
9:05
i'm going to move back over to the
9:07
teacher view here
9:10
now i'm back in the teacher view you can
9:11
see here's the comment here
9:13
now we do have some options here if i go
9:16
back here you can i can reply to this
9:18
comment but look at this i could either
9:20
delete or
9:21
mute this comment from ashton maybe if
9:23
it was inappropriate
9:24
now the settings i was talking about
9:27
maybe you want to limit to how much they
9:28
can communicate this way because i've
9:30
opened it up before and sometimes
9:32
students will just write random things
9:33
in it and
9:34
you can go through and delete these two
9:36
but if i go up to the settings here
9:40
and i'm just going to go down a little
9:41
bit here and here's the stream
9:44
now if we look students can post and
9:45
comment students can only comment only
9:48
teachers can post or comment so this
9:50
might be something you want to
9:51
think about inside the stream of how you
9:54
want to manage it
Adding resources and materials in Google Classroom
9:56
okay so now we're going to move over to
9:59
classwork
10:00
right here this is where you're going to
10:01
put your assignments
10:03
maybe material prior to any assignments
10:05
like course outlines or website links or
10:07
videos that you know they can access
10:09
again and again that you're commonly
10:11
using
10:12
but so what i like to do first now i'm
10:14
going to go to this button right here
10:16
and hit this
10:17
create in my mind how i organize things
10:19
and this could be different you can do
10:20
this in different orders
10:22
you could create your material first and
10:24
then assign the topic after
10:26
but i'm going to go to topics and a lot
10:29
of times in my mind i'm
10:30
thinking the topics first and so maybe i
10:33
have uh
10:33
resources on this one so i'll have a
10:37
topic of resources i'm going to create
10:40
uh one more two time i'm going to go
10:42
back to
10:43
topic again and i'm just going to create
10:46
material
10:47
so just to give a couple examples so i
10:49
have a couple topics so far
10:51
now i want to add things into
10:54
these places so i'm going to go up to
10:56
create again
10:57
and this time i'm going to click on
10:59
material
11:01
and this is where i get to create maybe
11:04
i want a course outline or something so
11:06
i'm just say
11:07
outline i could type some info whatever
11:10
i want into here
11:11
and i can go ahead and add so i click
11:14
the add button
11:15
for me a lot of times what i do is i
11:17
keep things in my google drive but if it
11:19
was on my computer and i needed to
11:20
upload a pdf i could do that
11:22
youtube file but i'm going to go ahead
11:25
and hit
11:26
add from google drive and just as an
11:29
example here
11:30
uh these are you know even if it says
11:32
assignments on it this is just a course
11:34
outline
11:35
ignore the assignment on it but uh this
11:37
could be my course outline
11:39
and i could go ahead and hit create or i
11:42
could add something else so maybe
11:44
there's a video that i want as part of
11:46
it maybe an intro video i created
11:48
i could go through and search or i could
11:50
go to if i knew the url
11:52
if i go over to a youtube video so if i
11:55
wanted them to know how to use google
11:56
meet
11:58
i could go back and i could just paste
12:00
this
12:01
right in here and add it so now i have a
12:04
document for my google drive and a video
12:07
from youtube
12:08
now if you look over here you know is it
12:10
for
12:11
uh all students is it for you know i
12:13
could individualize making sure
12:15
if you were uh you know if you wanted
12:17
different students to get different
12:18
material you could do that
12:19
i want all students on this one now my
12:21
topic i'm going to say
12:23
these are it's material and it's going
12:25
to be applied to that topic so i can go
12:27
ahead and hit post
12:30
and it goes ahead and post it so you can
12:32
see right here i have material
12:34
and i can go back in and i can click
12:36
these three dots whenever you see it
12:37
through three dots
12:38
you can see where you can delete i can
12:40
rename if i go
12:41
into this again and i can go through and
12:44
adjust things
12:45
right from here so always check for
12:48
those three dots of
12:49
what you can do to dive a little deeper
12:52
so i'm going to go back
12:54
just to my all my topics here i'm going
12:56
to create one more
12:58
and this time i'm going to go to
12:59
material so maybe there's some website
13:01
links that i want so
13:02
i'll just say websites and i'll just
13:06
type
13:06
info again and i'm going to go say add
13:08
and this time i just want to use a link
13:10
maybe i'm doing tinkercad some 3d design
13:13
and i'm just going to copy
13:15
this link from this website go back and
13:18
paste it
13:19
over here add the link and then i could
13:22
be
13:22
working with maybe we video i can be
13:25
copying this
13:26
and go back and add multiple ones again
13:29
so i can go add
13:31
another link and just i'll ctrl v this
13:34
time add link and i get multiple links
13:36
in it so again where do i want this to
13:38
go i want this to go
13:40
to resources this time and i'm going to
13:43
hit
13:43
post and it's the same options you know
13:46
for later
13:46
or save as draft if you want to go back
13:48
and edit it later but i'm just going to
13:49
go ahead and hit
13:50
post and now i'm just going to jump over
13:53
to the students view so you can see
13:56
what happened with them all right so i'm
Student view of resources and materials
13:59
logged in as the student now you can see
14:02
material resources and they can click on
14:04
the resources
14:05
you've given them websites to go to and
14:07
then they can just click on them
14:09
and it's going to open up and go to that
14:12
site so it makes a nice way to manage
14:14
making sure
14:14
students are getting to the right
14:16
websites they have the right material
14:17
remember they can access
14:19
this on their phone and it's great to be
14:22
able to keep
14:22
everything organized okay so now i'm
Creating an assignment in Google Classroom
14:25
going to go
14:26
and create an assignment and to do that
14:28
we go up to the crate here under the
14:30
classwork
14:31
i'm going to hit create and assignments
14:33
right here
14:34
i'm going to do a different video on
14:36
quizzes uh the
14:37
quiz assignment in question here uh so
14:40
when i'm done that check the link down
14:41
below in the description
14:43
and there'll be a link you to that but
14:44
for now i'm just sticking to the
14:46
assignment one
14:47
and i'm going to click on this and this
14:49
assignment is going to be about
14:51
cloud so i'm going to keep this pretty
14:53
straightforward and simple
14:54
you'd write your instructions here what
14:56
you want them to do you know whether
14:58
they're creating google slides or maybe
15:00
they're making a video you can
15:02
tell them what they need to do here so
15:04
i'm just going to be pretty general and
15:05
just type
15:06
info again i'm going to go ahead and add
15:09
some information to this one so i'm
15:11
going to go and hit add
15:13
this time i do want to give them a
15:15
another link
15:16
from right here it's just this cloud one
15:19
so i'm just going to go ctrl
15:20
c and over and then ctrl v
15:23
to add my link so they're going to use
15:26
this maybe as resources
15:27
i might put that in my instructions i'm
15:29
going to add
15:30
this time i'm going to go and grab a
15:32
document out of my google drive so
15:35
i've started a document it's going to be
15:38
types of clouds here and their
15:40
assignment is to track the different
15:41
types of clouds that they see
15:43
during a month maybe taking pictures of
15:45
it and then listing the characteristics
15:47
what makes them sure that it's that type
15:48
of cloud now
15:50
an important thing before we go ahead
15:52
and hit a sign and pick a topic for it
15:54
an important thing to know is this right
15:56
here
15:57
so it says students can view the file
16:00
now that means when you send it out like
16:01
that students will be able to
16:04
view the file and that's all they won't
16:06
be able to edit it so if you just want
16:08
them to be able to read the assignment
16:10
and maybe they're creating something
16:11
else
16:12
that's the option that you would choose
16:13
there students can edit the file
16:16
so if this was something collaborative
16:17
maybe the assignment is that all
16:19
students list the type of clouds under
16:21
this one document
16:22
it will create that one document for
16:24
them and everybody collaborates together
16:28
so you don't want to do that if you're
16:30
giving out maybe a worksheet that you
16:32
don't want
16:32
people to change and if you give that
16:34
they'll be able to change the original
16:36
one on that so be careful if you pick
16:37
that one
16:38
now this is one i tend to do a lot is
16:40
that make a
16:41
copy for each student so this will give
16:43
them an individual copy
16:45
to create uh each in their own drive
16:48
so they'll have it to work from and
16:50
that's the one i'm going to choose from
16:51
here
16:52
now i have the option again if i
16:55
go over here since i only have the one
16:57
class to choose from what i created if i
16:59
had different classes i could drop down
17:01
there
17:01
but all students again differentiating
17:04
from what students maybe get different
17:06
assignments you could do that
17:07
the points you can see if it's ungraded
17:10
or a point system here
17:12
uh due date i'm gonna so if we go ahead
17:15
and put a due date on it you can see we
17:17
just dropped down
17:18
and i can pick a date on it and the
17:20
topic now i haven't created the topic
17:22
for this and i showed you how to create
17:23
the topics
17:24
from uh prior before but if i was i can
17:27
create a topic
17:28
when i'm creating the assignment or
17:30
material too so if i was just going to
17:32
call this
17:33
you know i'll just say science now i
17:35
keep going down below
17:37
rubric i'm going to do a different video
17:38
on this one too explaining the rubric
17:40
a bit more so again look for the link
17:42
down below and
17:44
i'm going to leave everything like this
17:45
i'm going to assign it right away i
17:47
don't need to
17:48
say this as a draft i'm going to go
17:49
ahead and hit
17:51
a sign on this one so now what i'm going
17:54
to do is switch over to the student view
17:56
so you can see what they get out of the
17:58
assignment
Student view of the assignment
17:59
okay so i'm over in the students view
18:01
now and i've opened up you can see
18:03
there's the clouds one here's the
18:04
material
18:05
we have the view the assignments they
18:07
can go to the link here
18:09
i'm going to click on view the
18:10
assignment and you can see
18:13
some options that they get that they can
18:14
turn it on but we haven't done
18:16
anything um on it yet too so a lot of
18:18
times i'm just going to go back a screen
18:20
if they go ahead and open the document
18:22
here remember it created a copy for
18:24
all the different students so if they
18:27
were going to go through
18:28
and write whatever they want about the
18:30
clouds
18:31
when they're done what they need to do
18:34
is hit
18:34
turn in so then they can hit turn in and
18:37
then this is the better way of getting
18:39
them
18:39
to create you know create their own
18:43
they won't get that turn in option at
18:45
the end but if you create the document
18:47
to start with that turn in will be there
18:49
i'm just going to say got it on here and
18:51
we're going to say one attachment will
18:52
be submitted to clouds
18:54
turn in and then so they're going to go
18:57
ahead and
18:57
turn that in so at the point where it's
19:00
submitted you can see students
19:02
have the option to unsubmit it too so if
19:04
they need to make changes or maybe you
19:06
suggest that they make changes on it
19:07
they can go ahead
19:08
and unsubmit it before there's any marks
19:11
or anything
19:11
now they could go through and work on
19:14
this document some more
19:15
they can also add other documents so
19:17
they could add maybe they did create
19:19
something
19:20
from their google drive they didn't
19:21
start the assignment right they can go
19:23
ahead and just
19:24
add it from their google drive or from a
19:26
link or file
19:27
or they could create the document that
19:29
need they need it from
19:30
right here so they have some options of
19:32
how they want to do that there's also
19:34
a private commons place where you can go
19:37
back and forth
19:38
with the teacher on it but let's just
19:40
move across and see
19:41
what these assignments look like for the
19:43
teacher
19:45
so i just wanted to point out as you
19:46
post your assignments and different
Grading and returning assignment in Google Classroom
19:48
material
19:49
this does come up on the stream and this
19:51
is what
19:52
the students see also also when we go
19:55
over to classwork
19:56
you can change you can drag these around
19:59
and put these in different order if you
20:01
do want to change the round so i just
20:02
thought i'd mention that
20:04
but let's go to this assignment uh now
20:07
and you can see
20:07
right now two turned in so i went
20:09
through as the students and i
20:11
turned in two for them so if i go ahead
20:13
and just click on the two
20:15
assignments i can see the two students
20:17
that have turned it in here
20:19
and when i go ahead and click on them
20:22
and this is what i like how google
20:24
classroom has changed
20:25
this can save you a lot of time uh i can
20:28
go through and so you can see there's
20:30
ashton here but i can click on this and
20:33
i can switch
20:34
to the other students so i don't have to
20:36
have all these tabs opened across the
20:38
top
20:39
and even if i'm in like google slides
20:41
and different things i can switch
20:43
in here and it shows that this is turned
20:45
in so when you go
20:46
through and want to give a little bit
20:48
more this is where you give your marks
20:50
to if you're marking in here
20:52
you can see we have a few different
20:54
options where we can open in
20:55
this in a new window if we want but we
20:57
have our grades
20:58
right through here if i find those three
21:01
little
21:02
dots you can i can change the total
21:04
points of this
21:05
we can add our private comments also in
21:08
this one so i'll just give this kind of
21:09
a random grade here
21:11
if i was grading on a percent style but
21:13
you'll see where this goes to
21:15
as i said in the different one i'll talk
21:17
about the rubric where that might match
21:18
your
21:19
assessment needs a little bit better if
21:21
we have
21:22
comments here i haven't added any
21:24
comments to the bank here but you can
21:26
make a comment bank here so if i go to
21:28
add bank
21:29
we could go through and uh i'll just be
21:32
quick here
21:33
and we can add these comments that we
21:36
could go through
21:37
uh and you can again we can copy them to
21:39
the clipboard
21:40
and whenever you see those three dots
21:42
you can always get to more things
21:44
now i could quickly go to the you can
21:46
see the marks here i'm just going to go
21:48
to the other one and i'm going to
21:51
quickly
21:52
give this a mark over here we'll say 95
21:56
and now i'm just going to go and you can
21:58
see the marks are
21:59
both there different ways that i can
22:02
sort
22:03
and when i look at the top here if i'm
22:05
ready you can see it's not returned
22:07
i can return this submission or return
22:10
multiple submissions but i'll go both
22:12
here
22:13
and i can select all the different
22:15
students that are there and go ahead and
22:17
return
22:18
and just before i go to the students uh
22:21
the students view one more time
22:23
i just want to show you a different way
22:24
that you can go through i'm just going
22:26
to go back
22:26
to this one i'll just go back to my
22:29
classes
22:30
open this up if we go over to
22:33
people again here are my students if i
22:36
click on one of these students like this
22:38
you can see uh the different information
22:40
that this has been returned there's a
22:42
mark i can see there's a comment on this
22:44
one
22:45
what i really like about this view i can
22:47
quickly see if there's something missing
22:49
if something's turned in or not and you
22:51
can just scan
22:52
each student so you go to their name and
22:54
look down the list and you can see
22:56
there's a filter
22:57
here that you could look up so again
23:00
quick way to get
23:01
information i'm just going to go back
23:03
and the grades
23:05
go right in here so it's like a book
23:07
whether or not you use google classroom
23:09
uh for that maybe it's just more of an
23:11
organization but they do
23:13
they will collect the grades across here
23:15
so let's just go over to the students
23:17
one last time
23:18
so you can see what they're seeing with
23:19
the return grade
Students view of the returned assignment
23:21
all right so i'm back here in the
23:23
students i'm just in the assignment
23:25
uh the mark is up top there's a private
23:27
comment that i wrote back to it and
23:29
there's even a resubmit
23:30
in here so maybe the comments are maybe
23:32
resmitting and then you can re-grade it
23:34
after that so just
23:38
uh this has been kind of a general
23:39
overview to get you started if you
23:41
haven't used google classroom to see
23:42
all the possibilities that you can do it
23:45
works great again with the mobile apps
23:48
everything works the same students get
23:50
notified when you send out that
23:51
assignment
23:52
if they have notifications on their
23:54
devices so it works
23:55
very smoothly like i said i am going to
23:57
put some more videos i'll create a
23:59
playlist of all the different things
24:01
that you can do inside google classroom
24:03
but hopefully this gets you started
24:05
using this
24:06
effectively and efficiently thanks for
24:08
watching this time on teachers tech i'll
24:10
see you next time with more
24:11
tech tips and tutorials


---


welcome back to my channel and if you
0:01
are new here I am so happy that you
0:03
found me my name is Michele 4a I am a
0:06
fourth grade teacher in Maryland and I
0:08
also serve as my school's ecoach which
0:10
means I help teachers integrate
0:12
educational technology into their
0:14
classrooms for today's episode of EdTech
0:16
made easy I wanted to give you all a
0:18
tutorial for how to get started with
0:20
Google classroom along with giving you
0:23
all some tips and tricks for using it
0:25
with your teaching if you have never
0:31
heard of Google classroom it is a
0:33
service that allows you to share files
0:35
create assignments great assignments and
0:38
communicate with your students in a
0:39
paperless way the good news is that
0:41
Google classroom is completely free the
0:44
bad news however is that your school or
0:47
district does have to sign up for a G
0:50
suite for education account in order to
0:52
use it with students now your school or
0:54
district can sign up for free and the G
0:57
suite for education account will help to
0:59
ensure additional privacy and security
1:01
for students so if your school or
1:03
district is not already signed up
1:05
definitely share this information with
1:07
them and hopefully they would be willing
1:08
to sign up once they see all the amazing
1:10
features Google classroom has to offer
1:12
now I am going to link the Google
1:14
classroom website down in the
1:15
description box that way you can open it
1:17
up and follow along with me as I go
1:19
through this tutorial the first thing
Creating a Class
1:21
you need to do is create your class now
1:24
depending on what you teach you may only
1:26
need to create one class or you may want
1:29
to create different classes for each
1:30
subject you teach or each group of
1:32
students you teach in order to create a
1:35
class you are going to click on the plus
1:37
sign in the upper right corner and then
1:39
click on create class if your school
1:41
does not already have a G suite for
1:43
education account you will be prompted
1:45
with a message asking your school or
1:48
district to sign up for one before you
1:50
use the service with students you will
1:52
then enter the class name section
1:54
subject and room number but the only
1:56
part that's actually required is the
1:58
class name I really like to include my
2:00
personal name in the class such as miss
2:03
phrase math class since my students do
2:06
join multiple classes through Google
2:08
classroom and I don't want them to get
2:09
confused on which is which once you are
2:12
done
2:12
entering the information you will click
2:14
on create class and you will then be
2:16
redirected to the classes page before we
2:18
navigate this page I do want to talk to
2:20
you all about how to have students join
Joining a Class
2:22
your class once you have created it you
2:24
can individually add students to the
2:27
class by clicking on the people tab at
2:29
the top and then clicking the invite
2:31
students button next to the student
2:33
heading you can then enter your students
2:35
email address to individually add them
2:37
to the class however a much easier way
2:40
to do this is actually have the students
2:41
join your class on their own under your
2:44
class name you will see a class code
2:46
which is an assortment of different
2:48
letters and numbers in order to join
2:50
your class
2:51
students will go to Google classroom and
2:53
click on the plus sign in the upper
2:54
right-hand corner instead of clicking
2:56
create class students will click join
2:59
class and then type in your personal
3:01
class code you can display your class
3:03
code in a larger size by clicking on the
3:06
display button next to the class code
3:08
the good news is once a student joins
3:10
your class once it will always appear in
3:13
their Google classroom until you either
3:14
remove the student from the class or
3:16
archive the class now let's go ahead and
Changing Themes
3:19
jump into the features of the class page
3:21
first of all you can change the theme
3:23
which will change up the colors and the
3:25
images by clicking on the select theme
3:27
button in the rectangle surrounding your
3:29
class name you can either use one of the
3:32
pre created themes offered through
3:33
Google or you can use a personalized
3:36
photo by clicking on upload photo and
3:38
then choosing the photo from your
3:40
computer I personally really like to
3:42
have a different color or theme for each
3:45
one of my classes to help me
3:46
differentiate between them the default
3:48
tab is the stream tab the stream tab
3:51
houses all of the activity that has
3:53
taken place within your classroom such
3:56
as any announcements or assignments you
3:58
have posted as a teacher and any comment
4:01
or post from students if you allow them
4:03
with the most recent appearing at the
4:05
top you can easily post announcements or
Stream Tab
4:08
add attachments to the stream page by
4:10
clicking in these share with your class
4:12
box you can either type a message to
4:14
your students you can attach files from
4:17
your computer or Google Drive you can
4:19
add YouTube videos or
4:21
links and then post it directly to your
4:23
stream page you also can schedule this
4:25
post to go out at a specific date and
4:27
time or you can save the post as a draft
4:30
to post at a later time you can also
4:32
choose to share this announcement with
4:34
all students in the class or you can
4:36
select specific students by clicking the
4:38
drop-down arrow next to the all students
4:40
section now the classwork tab at the top
4:43
is the main place where you can create
4:44
assignments for your students in order
4:47
to create a new assignment just click on
4:49
the create button and then choose the
4:51
type of assignment you want to create
4:52
the regular assignment option is what I
4:54
tend to use most often because it is the
4:57
most open-ended I have the ability to
4:59
create my own title type in my own
5:01
instructions along with attaching to any
5:03
documents from my computer Google Drive
5:05
YouTube videos or links just like before
5:08
how this is different from adding an
5:11
announcement on the stream page is that
5:13
I am able to assign a point value to the
5:15
assignment or have it be ungraded I can
5:18
also assign a due date for students to
5:20
complete the assignment by and I can
5:22
create a topic for the assignment as I
5:24
described before you can choose to post
5:26
the assignment immediately schedule the
5:28
assignment to go out at a specific date
5:30
and time or you can save it as a draft
5:32
and return to it later I really like to
5:35
schedule all of my Google classroom
5:36
assignments at the beginning of the
5:38
month when I sit down to do my long term
5:40
planning so it is done and off of my
5:42
plate
5:43
the quiz assignment option will
5:45
automatically attach a blank Google
5:47
Forms that you can use to create a quiz
5:49
for your students the question option
5:51
allows you to pose a question to your
5:53
students and then have them respond to
5:55
it the material option is a great way to
5:57
share attachments or materials with your
6:00
students that you want them to have
6:02
access to without prompting a specific
6:05
assignment for them to complete I
6:06
personally use the material option to
6:08
share digital copies of the notes with
6:10
my students along with different
6:12
resources such as a multiplication chart
6:14
that I want them to have access to all
6:16
year long the reuse post option allows
6:19
you to reuse a post that you have
6:21
already created in another class on
6:23
Google classroom the topic option is a
6:26
great way to organize all of your
6:27
assignments into categories under the
Google Calendar
6:30
classwork tab you can also view the
6:32
google calendar for your class
6:34
we'll house all of the due dates for all
6:36
of the assignments that you have created
6:37
along with the Google Drive folder which
6:40
houses all of the attachments that you
6:42
have added to your class as you add
6:44
assignments and materials and questions
6:46
to the classwork tab they will also
6:49
appear on your stream tab in
6:51
chronological order with the most recent
6:53
appearing at the top I do want to
6:55
quickly share a few ideas for different
6:57
types of assignments that you could have
6:59
your students complete through Google
7:00
classroom just in case you're not
7:02
exactly sure what I'm talking about
7:03
first of all you can link different
7:06
articles or websites to have your
7:07
students do research and then have them
7:10
answer questions either by using the
7:12
question option on Google classroom or
7:14
by linking a Google Doc where you
7:16
already have outlined all of the
7:18
questions you want them to answer you
7:20
can also link quizzes or check for
7:22
understandings through Google Forms that
7:24
you want your students to complete and
7:25
the best part about Google Forms is you
7:27
can make them self grading you can also
7:30
have students complete graphic
7:31
organizers digitally through Google Docs
7:34
or Google sheets the options are truly
7:37
endless so if you would like me to make
7:38
a future and tech made easy video on how
7:41
to digitize assignments and have
7:43
students complete them through Google
7:44
classroom but let me know down in the
7:46
comments and I can definitely do that
7:47
moving on to the next tab the people tab
People Tab
7:50
allows you to see all of the teachers
7:52
and students you have connected to your
7:55
class I already showed you how to invite
7:57
students to the class but you can follow
7:59
the same steps to add other teachers to
8:02
your class if you co teach or if you
8:04
want them to have access to your
8:06
materials once you have invited students
8:08
to your class you can also invite their
8:10
parents or guardians to the class so
8:13
that they can receive updates and check
8:14
on their students grades you also have
8:17
the ability to email students mute
8:19
students which revokes their ability to
8:21
post and comment on things on Google
8:23
classroom this one comes in handy trust
8:26
me or remove students from your class if
8:28
they are no longer in it the grades have
Grades Tab
8:31
is essentially an online gradebook for
8:34
all of the assignments for all of the
8:35
students that you have on Google
8:37
classroom this is super handy to be able
8:40
to see it all in one place you also can
8:42
go in and
8:43
and any of the grades from this screen
8:45
if you need to instead of going directly
8:47
to that assignment you can also click on
8:50
any assignment and view student work
8:52
that was submitted or you can click on a
8:54
student and see all of the work that
8:56
they have submitted for the different
8:58
assignments the last important feature I
Class Settings
9:00
want to highlight with Google classroom
9:02
is the class settings you can access the
9:05
settings by clicking on the gear icon in
9:07
the upper right hand corner of your
9:09
class page you can edit any of the
9:11
information for your class in the class
9:13
details section in case it changes the
9:16
general settings allows you to do a lot
9:18
of different things first of all you can
9:20
choose to display copy reset or disable
9:24
your class code you can change the
9:26
settings for your stream page and the
9:28
abilities of teachers or students to
9:29
post and comment you also can change the
9:32
settings for the display of
9:33
notifications on the string page and you
9:36
can choose to show deleted items or not
9:38
in the grades calculation section you
9:41
have the ability to edit the grading
9:43
system
9:43
to either go off of total points or have
9:46
a weighted grading system with
9:48
categories now that is all I have for
9:50
getting started with Google classroom
9:52
but but I can tell you I have some tips
9:54
and tricks up my sleeves for making
9:56
Google classroom more efficient and
9:58
organized so if you want me to do

Google Calendar is an easy-to-use, yet powerful
0:02
scheduling solution that makes sharing events and calendars with others a breeze.
0:07
Knowing how to use it effectively will save you time and help
0:11
keep your life more organized. Hi everyone, I'm
0:13
Anson Alexander and in this video I'm going to
0:16
show you everything that you need to know to
0:19
use Google Calendar effectively and efficiently.
0:22
I'll cover all of the primary features, I'll
0:24
provide examples for sharing events and sharing
0:27
calendars and plenty of tips and tricks to enhance your experience. Let's get into it!
0:32
Okay, so here I am in Google Calendar.
0:35
I got here by going to calendar.google.
0:37
com and then I logged in with a Google account. When you first
Calendar view options
0:40
log into Google Calendar, you'll see the current
0:42
day in the middle of your screen, and you can tell
0:44
it's the current day because it's highlighted in blue.
0:47
Since we're in the week view, we can also
0:49
see the current time by this little red line,
0:52
so if we had a meeting coming up here in our
0:53
schedule, we'd be able to see that the current
0:55
time is approaching that meeting, so get ready.
0:58
Now at the same time, we also have a mini calendar
1:00
over here to the left, so you can cycle through
1:02
the months by using the arrows, and then if you
1:05
want to go to a particular day, you can click on
1:07
it, and in our case right now since we're in week
1:09
view, it takes us to the week of the 22nd, or it's
1:12
the week of the 21st, right, but we clicked on the
1:14
22nd, so we're shown this week. If you ever want
1:17
to go back to today, you can just click on the today button up here at the top left.
1:21
Now like I said, we're currently in the week view, but if
1:24
we take a look over here at the top right of the
1:26
screen, we have a drop down where we can change
1:28
our view, so we could look at a month view, and
1:30
you can kind of see what the calendar looks like there.
1:33
If we had any events, they'd be listed on here.
1:36
I also want to show you the schedule view.
1:38
This is a very helpful view if you have a day
1:40
jam-packed with meetings. You'll see all your
1:42
meetings listed. Right now, we only have the
1:44
holidays listed because we don't have any meetings
1:47
on this calendar, but if we had, say, eight
1:49
meetings in one day, we would see all eight of
1:51
those meetings here listed, so that's a really
1:53
helpful view for those busy days, but for now,
1:56
I'll go ahead and I'll go back to the week view,
Creating events
1:59
and now let's start talking about creating events.
2:02
There are a couple of different ways to create
2:04
events here in Google Calendar. You can either
2:06
click on the create button up here at the top left, and then you can choose event,
2:11
or you can just single click on the day and time
2:14
in your calendar, so since we're in week view,
2:17
let's say I wanted to create a reoccurring event
2:20
for Mondays, so let me go ahead and go to next
2:22
week since that hasn't happened yet, and we'll
2:24
go ahead and we want to create a weekly kickoff
2:27
meeting, so I'm just going to click here at, say,
2:30
8.30. You'll notice when I click, a little window
2:33
pops up, and this is the quick create event window,
2:36
and we can create an event right from here.
2:38
If we'd like, we can add a title, you can fill out
2:41
this information, and then click save.
2:43
However, we can also access more options by clicking on
2:45
this more options button, and I want to show you
2:47
that because that's just going to allow me to show
2:50
you more features. We'll have everything there
2:52
that we have on this screen plus some more, so
2:54
let's click on more options. So now we are in
2:57
the full event creation screen. You'll notice
3:00
that first of all, at the top, we can give our
3:02
event a title, so we could just call this kickoff
3:05
meeting, and then we can specify the day and the time.
3:09
So obviously, we clicked on our calendar on
3:11
the day and time that we wanted it, but if we had
3:13
been in, say, the month view and we just clicked
3:15
on a day, it wouldn't know exactly what time we
3:17
wanted it, so we want to check and make sure that it's correct.
3:20
So maybe this isn't 8.30 to 9.
3:21
30, it's just 8.30 to 9, so it's only half an hour,
All day and repeating events
3:25
and then we have the option here to make this
3:27
an all-day event. Generally speaking, that's going
3:31
to be for, like, when you're on vacation or if you
3:34
have a business trip, events that will take the entire day.
3:37
So maybe you're going to a conference,
3:38
you could create it as an all-day event, and
3:40
then if you have meetings at that conference,
3:42
you can create additional events that are at a
3:45
specific time that get added to your calendar in
3:48
addition to the all-day event. So for this particular meeting, it's only half an hour,
3:52
it's not an all-day event. However, it does repeat. So you'll notice that we have this
3:57
dropdown, and by default, it says does not repeat,
3:59
but that's not what we want. We want this one to
4:02
repeat weekly on Monday, but notice that we have
4:05
a number of different options. You can have it
4:07
repeat monthly on the first Monday, since that's the one we're looking at right now.
4:11
If this was the second Monday, it would ask us if we wanted
4:14
to create it every second Monday of the month.
4:16
You could have it repeat annually every weekday,
4:19
or we could even do a custom repeat schedule.
4:22
So I'll let you check that out if you'd like, but for
4:24
this one, we want it to repeat weekly on Monday.
4:28
So now down here, we have the event details.
Finding available times
4:30
But before I get into that, I want to show you this
4:33
little option here. It says find a time.
4:35
And when we click on that, it will bring up our calendar
4:38
for the current day and time that we have selected
4:41
up here at the top to allow us to look at our
4:43
calendar to make sure we're not over scheduling.
4:45
So we can look in here and see what slots we have available.
4:48
So that just helps you find a time.
4:50
So let's click back to the event details.
4:52
And notice that if we were doing a video meeting using
4:55
Google Meet, we could add the meeting right here,
4:58
and it would create the meeting link for us.
4:59
And it would email it to all the guests once
5:01
we invite them to this event so that we don't
5:03
have to go in, you know, afterwards and create
5:06
a Google Meet meeting and set up the time and everything.
5:08
Google Calendar will do it for us.
5:11
If you want to add a location, you could do that.
5:13
This is obviously important if you're having
5:15
people who are traveling in for an event that they
5:17
might not be used to traveling to your location,
5:19
let them know the address so that they can get there properly.
5:21
And then down here we have the notification settings. So by default, it's going
Event notifications
5:26
to send us a notification one day before this event.
5:29
So that's 24 hours before the start time of this event.
5:32
And you'll notice that so you know, a notification is in a browser, you'll get a pop
5:37
up. And so you do need to allow Google Calendar
5:39
to show you pop ups in order to see those browser notifications.
5:43
However, on your mobile device, if you have Google Calendar set up on your mobile
5:47
phone, you will get a push notification.
5:49
Now, if we click on this drop down, you'll notice that
5:52
we also have the option for an email notification.
5:54
And you know, right now it's set to one days,
5:56
but instead of days, we could do minutes,
5:58
hours, days or weeks. So this is before the event starts. So I could do this, you know,
6:02
one hour before. And obviously, I could change
6:04
this number too. So I could make it, you know,
6:06
two hours before. So that's up to you. And I'm going to show you here in a little bit,
6:11
when we get into our Google Calendar settings,
6:13
how you can change the default notifications
6:15
for your calendar so that you don't have to go
6:17
into every event and set the notifications if
6:19
there's a certain notification that you like to
6:21
get every single time. So I'll show you how to
6:23
do that once we get into the Google Calendar settings.
6:26
But for now, you can choose whichever you'd like.
6:28
And notice that you can add multiple notifications if you'd like as well.
6:30
So you can do email and pop up as well. Down here in this
6:34
section, we can choose which calendar we'd like
6:37
to put this event on. Now, by default, it's
6:39
going to add it to our private default Google
6:42
Calendar that's created when we create a Google
6:44
Calendar account. However, we can have multiple
6:47
calendars here in Google Calendar, and I'm going
6:48
to show you how to create and share multiple calendars.
6:51
And if we are using multiple calendars, we want to make sure that we're choosing the
6:54
right calendar here. Like I said, by default,
6:56
it's going to be your personal private calendar,
6:58
but you might have say a company calendar or I
7:01
like to have a calendar with my wife so that we
7:03
have family events on there. So if I'm scheduling
7:06
a meeting or an event for the family calendar,
7:08
I want to make sure that I'm choosing the family
7:10
calendar here when I create the event.
Event visibility and free vs. busy
7:12
Now the next option with the suitcase symbol to the left
7:15
is where we can specify how this event should
7:18
affect our schedule availability. I think there
7:20
can be some confusion about this option.
7:22
So I want to spend a couple minutes here.
7:24
There are really two things going on. The first one where
7:27
it says busy, let's us specify whether or not we
7:30
want others to see us as busy for this event or not.
7:34
So if somebody else is going to invite us
7:36
to an event, and we have selected busy and we go
7:39
ahead and we save this event, if they schedule
7:41
their event for the same time at 830 on August
7:43
7, it's going to let them know when they invite
7:46
us that we're busy at that time. Now depending
7:48
on what we do with the next option, they may or
7:50
may not be able to see why we're busy.
7:52
But the first option just lets them know that we're busy
7:54
so they can try and reschedule the event for another time.
7:57
If for some reason we want to appear free, we don't want people to know that we're
8:01
doing something, or maybe it's one of those all
8:03
day events where you still want to be invited to
8:06
meetings, you want to mark this as free so that
8:08
when people invite you to an event, it's not
8:10
telling them, hey, they can't attend, they're busy,
8:12
you want to let them invite you. So we'll leave
8:14
this as busy because this is a half an hour in
8:16
person meeting, and we don't want other people to
8:18
schedule things for us over it. But do be aware
8:21
that that's what that first option is.
8:23
Now this second option deals with the visibility of the event itself.
8:28
So by default, in your Google calendar,
8:31
you actually have some settings for the calendar
8:34
itself that deal with whether or not events are
8:36
public or private. And by default, it's set to private.
8:39
So by default, where it says this default
8:41
visibility, if you haven't changed any settings in
8:44
Google Calendar, and you choose default visibility,
8:46
it will be a private event. So only you and the
8:49
guests that you invite will be able to see the details.
8:52
However, if you want this event to be public, so maybe it's going on your company
8:56
website, or it's an organization, and you're having
8:58
fundraisers and things like that, you would want
9:00
to make this event public. Now, like I said, if
9:03
you haven't made any changes, you should be safe,
9:05
leaving it at default visibility. However, if you
9:07
want to be sure, you can always select private,
9:10
and then you know for sure that only you and
9:12
the people invited will be able to see the event details.
9:15
So we'll leave it as busy and private
9:18
for that section. Then down here at the bottom,
Event descriptions
9:21
we can add an event description, notice that you
9:23
have a lot of word processing tools that you can
9:26
use to write that out, you can add links in here,
9:28
you can even add attachments by uploading files.
9:31
So if there's a brochure or an image, a PDF,
9:34
anything like that, you can upload it right here
9:36
to the event description. Now, once we have all
Inviting and managing guests
9:39
that sorted out, we need to talk about adding
9:42
guests to our event. So we can add guests over
9:44
here to the right and the easiest way to add them
9:47
is by email address. However, if you have your
9:49
guests in your Google contacts, you can just
9:51
start typing their name, and it will automatically pop up.
9:55
And so this is actually the same account that I'm on.
9:59
So let's go ahead and add another one as well.
10:01
I guess this isn't in my contacts.
10:04
And so we will add that person as well.
10:05
So I just, you know, wrote the email address and then hit enter.
10:08
You'll notice that they get added to a list down here.
10:11
Now from here, I could hit the X to
10:13
remove them from this event. If I've already sent
10:15
an invitation, they'll still see the invitation
10:17
email, you can't unsend that when they click to
10:19
see the event details, they will no longer have
10:22
access as long as it's a private event, right.
Using “suggested times”
10:24
And so you'll notice that when I add that second
10:26
email address, it says that the calendar cannot be shown.
10:29
However, if you work for an organization
10:31
and you all use Google Calendar, or if you have
10:33
shared calendars with somebody in your family,
10:36
when you add them to this event, you'll see a
10:37
different option here, which I'll show on the screen now that says suggested times.
10:41
And if you click on that, it will check and make sure that
10:45
all of your guests are free during the time of this event.
10:48
And it will try to find a free slot.
10:50
So let's say you work at a company and you maybe
10:52
invite eight people to a meeting, you all use
10:54
Google Calendar, you could click on suggested
10:56
times, and it will find a time where everybody is available.
10:59
So that's a great way to schedule
11:00
meetings when everybody else has a busy schedule as well.
11:03
And you're always having trouble trying
11:05
to find the perfect time. Google Calendar can
11:06
help you do that if everybody in your organization
11:09
is using Google Calendar. So don't forget to
Guest permissions
11:11
check out that feature as well. And then down at
11:13
the bottom, there are a few other permissions,
11:16
you can take a look at them, they're pretty self explanatory. But do you want guests to
11:19
be able to modify the event, so the description,
11:21
the time, all sorts of things like that?
11:23
Do you want them to be able to invite other people?
11:25
And do you want them to be able to see the guest list?
11:28
So once you've got everything figured out how
11:30
you'd like it to be, you can go ahead and click
11:32
on the blue Save button at the top right.
11:34
And it lets us know, hey, we invited some people to this
11:37
event, do we want to send them invitation emails?
11:40
Generally speaking, if you want to notify them
11:43
about the event, then it's probably a good idea.
11:45
But you might have a company culture or something
11:47
that's different than that. So obviously depends
11:49
on your situation. But I would normally click Send.
11:51
For now, I'm just going to click don't send
11:54
because it's just a test event. So now you can see
11:57
we're brought back here into Google Calendar.
11:59
And we can see that we have our kickoff meeting
12:01
scheduled for 830am on Monday. If we were to go
12:04
to the next week, you can see that on the 14th,
12:07
we also have that meeting and I could just switch
12:09
to the month view. You'll notice that we have our
12:12
kickoff meeting now scheduled for every Monday.
12:14
So now that we have our meeting scheduled, we can
Modifying and deleting events
12:17
actually click on it right here on the calendar.
12:20
And it will bring up all of the details about this event.
12:22
So we can see the title, the time, all the
12:24
things that we specified. Now from here, we could
12:27
modify the event by clicking on the pencil icon,
12:29
we could delete it by clicking on the trash icon.
12:31
And because this is a repeating event, let me
12:34
show you, when I click on delete, it lets me know,
12:36
do I just want to delete this single event?
12:38
Do I want to delete this event in all of the future ones?
12:41
Or do I want to delete this event, all the
12:43
future ones and all of the past events that would
12:46
be this all events option? Now I'm not going to
12:48
do that right now, but I just want to show you how
12:50
you could delete an event. And so we can click Cancel.
12:52
And then notice that there are also three
12:54
dots here that have a number of different options,
12:57
you can duplicate events, you can print them,
12:59
you could change the owner of it. And if this was
13:01
a public event, you would be able to share it from here as well.
13:04
So down here, you know, you can specify whether you are going or not.
13:09
Generally, you are by default, it says that you're going to
13:12
do an event that you've created, but maybe you're
13:14
just the creator and you're not going to be there,
13:16
you could select no here. But that's just how you
13:18
can view your event details. So we'll just go
13:20
ahead and close that out for now. Okay, awesome,
Viewing multiple calendars
13:23
that should cover events pretty well.
13:25
Now let's talk about using multiple calendars and sharing calendars.
13:28
So if you take a look at the left side
13:30
of the screen, we have two sections, we have the
13:33
my calendar section, and we have the other calendar
13:35
section, the my calendar section will have any
13:38
calendars that you either create or are the owner
13:40
of. And the other calendar section will have
13:42
calendars that have been shared with you.
13:44
Notice that for all of these calendars, there's a little checkbox.
13:48
And we can display and hide these calendars as we'd like. So we can have multiple
13:52
calendars displayed at once, meaning we're going
13:54
to see all the events from all of our calendars,
13:56
or we could only display one calendar, if it's
13:58
maybe a packed calendar, we don't want to view
14:00
all the other ones, we could just look at that one.
14:02
So you might have one for work, you might have a
14:04
personal one, you might have a family one, and
14:06
then you might have, you know, different ones for
14:08
different organizations that you're part of.
14:09
So when you're scheduling those organization events,
14:12
you can have those calendars displayed.
14:13
But if you're just looking at your personal life events,
14:15
you can only display those ones. So for instance,
14:17
if I hide the personal one, you'll notice that the
14:20
kickoff meeting disappears, the event is still
14:22
there, it hasn't been deleted or anything.
14:24
But I'm just not looking at that calendar anymore.
14:27
If we were to, you know, begin a month with a holiday,
14:29
so September should have a holiday, the holidays
14:32
are still there. But I could uncheck that and hide
14:34
the holidays as well. And then I could recheck my
14:36
personal to show the meetings. And then I could
14:38
also show the meetings and the holidays.
14:40
So you can mix and match these calendars however you'd like.
14:43
That's what the checkboxes are over here on the left.
Creating new calendars
14:47
So if we want to create a new calendar,
14:50
the easiest way to do that is to just click on
14:52
this plus button here next to other calendars.
14:55
You'll notice that we have a few different options here.
14:57
But the one that we want is create new calendar.
14:59
We're brought here into the Google Calendar settings where we can give our calendar
15:05
a name, a description and we can select the timezone.
15:09
And then once we're ready, we can click create calendar.
Modifying calendar settings
15:14
You'll notice that when we do that here
15:16
in our settings, we now have another calendar
15:19
listed work calendar, it's in the settings for my calendars.
15:23
So if I click on work calendar,
15:25
we're brought to this calendar settings here in
15:27
Google Calendar settings. So these are only the
15:29
settings for this particular calendar, but this
15:31
is where we can share it. So I want to go through
15:33
this since we were brought here anyways.
15:34
So we already gave it a name, we gave it a description,
15:36
we specified a timezone, which was automatically
15:39
specified based on the timezone where I'm at.
15:42
So down here, I'm not going to go through all of
15:44
the settings in Google Calendar, but I'm going to go through the important ones.
15:47
So first of all, we have the auto accept invitations not that important.
Making calendars public
15:51
This one's important. If we want this to be a public calendar, all we need to do is
15:54
select this checkbox right here, and then we can get the shareable link to share it.
Sharing calendars
15:59
But notice that this is where we can add people to share this calendar with.
16:02
So I could go ahead and I could click on that.
16:04
And then I could invite the person that I'd like to share it with. So we can know
16:08
this could be, you know, I'm creating the work
16:10
calendar, but I could be creating a family
16:12
calendar, we could pretend as a family, and this
16:14
is somebody else in my family. So I go ahead and
16:16
enter their email address, and then I can select
16:18
the permissions that they should have for this calendar.
Shared calendar permissions
16:20
So only to see whether I'm free or busy.
16:23
So that's a good option for your personal calendar,
16:26
you can share it with your family.
16:28
But if you don't want them to see the actual events,
16:30
for whatever reason, you could just make it so they can see that you're free or busy,
16:33
but they can't see the details, or we could
16:35
make it so that they can see all the details,
16:37
or they can make we could make it so they can
16:39
make changes to events, or so that they could make
16:42
changes and manage sharing. So obviously, that's up to you.
16:45
Maybe for this one, I just want them
16:47
to be able to see it. So I can go ahead and click Send.
Changing calendar notifications
16:51
And then down here, I mentioned that we could specify default notifications.
16:55
So that's where this is right here, event notifications,
16:58
we're talking about this calendar's event notifications.
17:01
So we can specify the default notifications for this particular calendar, just
17:05
by clicking on this button and then adding the
17:07
notifications like we did when creating an event.
17:09
So I'm just going to remove that for now.
17:11
Same thing if we wanted to create all day event notifications.
17:13
And you'll notice that there are
17:15
a number of other notification options in here as well.
17:17
So when changes are made to the calendar,
17:20
when people are invited, or the event is canceled,
17:22
all that sort of thing, you can go in here and
17:24
you can take a look and specify that if you'd like.
Deleting and unsubscribing
17:26
And then down at the very bottom is where
17:28
you can unsubscribe to a calendar that's been
17:30
shared with you if you no longer want to see it.
17:32
And you could also delete your calendar if you
17:34
wanted as well, it will delete all of the events
17:36
on that calendar. So be careful down here at the bottom.
17:40
But okay, that's enough for the settings for right now.
17:43
We'll be back here in a minute.
17:44
Let's go back. And let's make sure that this
17:46
calendar is actually working. So here it is, we
17:48
have work calendar. So we could go ahead and,
Moving events to other calendars
17:51
you know, we have this kickoff meeting, which is
17:53
on the personal calendar, maybe I could click on this event.
17:57
And then I could go ahead and you'll
17:58
notice that my calendars right here, but I could
18:01
click on the pencil, I could go into this event to
18:03
this calendar section that we looked at earlier.
18:05
And now I could specify that I want it on my work calendar.
18:08
And I could give this event a particular
18:10
color if I'd like, by default, it's just going to
18:12
get the color of the calendar. So we go ahead and save this.
18:16
And notice that we can change our calendar colors over here, right from the three
18:20
dots in the list over here. But by default, all
18:22
the events are going to get the color of the calendar.
18:25
So we actually created this event, and it moved it to our work calendar.
18:30
But notice something interesting, it actually duplicated this event.
18:33
And it does that by default, just in case
18:35
Google Calendar doesn't want you to mistakenly delete things.
18:38
So even if I refresh the page,
18:39
you'll notice that I still have both events.
18:41
So now I could go to the one on the personal
18:42
calendar, which I can tell because of the blue and
18:45
blue, and I could hit Delete. And I could delete all the events.
18:48
So every single one, and they're all off the personal calendar, but I now have it
18:51
on the work calendar. And then just to show you
Displaying and hiding calendars
18:54
something else, let's just say I had a dentist appointment.
18:57
And that dentist appointment was at a particular time, let's say it was at 2pm.
19:03
And I'm going to put it on my personal calendar.
19:06
Now I can click Save, you'll notice that we have
19:08
the work event, which is the same color as the
19:10
work calendar, then we have the personal event,
19:12
the same color as the personal calendar.
19:14
And if I hide my personal calendar, it hides my personal event.
19:18
But I can display it again, and then I
19:20
can hide my work calendar, and it hides the work
19:22
meetings, hide the holidays. So you can see how we
19:25
can view all the calendars at once, or we can mix
19:27
and match however we'd like. Okay, awesome, we've
19:30
created and shared a calendar and know how to use
19:33
it. There are just a few more things that I think
19:34
you're going to find useful. First of all, up here
Searching for events
19:36
at the top right, remember that there's a magnifying glass.
19:39
And if you click on it, you can search for your events.
19:41
So you can search by the people who
19:43
are invited to the events, the name of the events,
19:45
the description. And if you click on this little
19:47
arrow over to the right, there are even more
19:50
options about searching for, you know, who's in
19:52
the event, or where it is, or the date range that it could be in.
19:56
So if you're having trouble finding a particular event, this is very powerful.
20:00
Do not forget to use the search feature. Aside from that,
Important settings
20:03
let's take a look at our Google Calendar settings.
20:06
So I'm just going to click on this gear icon.
20:08
And first of all, notice that we have this density
20:11
and color option, which allow us to change some
20:13
of the aesthetic things about our Google Calendar,
20:16
essentially what color set we're using, and how
20:18
dense we want the information. So do be aware that
20:21
that is where that is. But what we really want to
20:23
get to is the actual settings by clicking on the
20:26
gear icon and then settings. So here we are in the settings.
20:29
And we were here earlier, we were working in this bottom left area. And now we're
20:33
going to go through our general Google Calendar settings.
20:35
I'm not going to go through everyone.
20:36
Don't worry. I'm just going to go through the important ones.
20:39
You can click over here on the left to get to the different areas, or you can
20:42
scroll down and it will just take you through all of them.
20:44
So notice that, you know, we've got all
20:46
the language country. If you are using a different
20:49
time zone, you can change that as well.
20:52
So these are the default event settings. So when we create
20:55
an event on Google Calendar, by default, how long
20:58
do we want that event to be? By default, it's 60 minutes.
21:00
If you always create half an hour events,
21:02
you could change the default in here if you'd like.
21:05
And there are some default guest permissions.
21:08
You also have some settings on how you would
21:11
like your notifications to be displayed.
21:13
And then you've got some view option settings,
21:15
which I do think are important. So some people
21:17
like to turn off weekends. Some people like to
21:21
have their week start on Monday instead of Sunday,
21:24
because that's the start of the work week.
21:26
You can set a custom view. So by default, we have month
21:29
view, we have week view, we have year view, we don't have a two week view, right?
21:32
So you could have a two week view, or you could have, you know,
21:35
a four day view. So there are some custom views
21:37
in here that you can look at. And then scrolling
21:39
down, there isn't too much more. If you want to
21:41
be able to see your calendar offline, you can
21:44
check this checkbox down here at the very bottom.
21:46
That's pretty much it for the important settings,
21:48
although you can look through on your own and see
21:50
what you can find. So I hope you now feel
21:52
comfortable creating events in Google Calendar,
21:54
working with and creating multiple shared
21:56
calendars and tweaking your account settings
21:59
to fit your needs. If you found this video helpful, I would really appreciate a thumbs

- Are you new to Google Calendar
0:02
or perhaps you just need a refresher?
0:05
Either way, you are in the right place
0:07
because in this video I'm going to show you everything you need
0:11
to know about Google Calendar.
0:14
Let's get started with adding
0:16
and editing an event to adding new event.
0:20
Simply click on the area of your schedule
0:23
where you would like it to be placed.
0:25
I'm going to select 11:00 AM on Wednesday.
0:28
By selecting this, it will bring up a mini window
0:32
where I can immediately start
0:33
to type in the title of my event.
0:36
This is going to be the quickest way to add an event.
0:40
So for example, maybe I'm scheduling a lunch
0:43
with my friend Todd.
0:44
I'm going to enter in that title
0:46
and then hit enter on my computer
0:49
and immediately that event is added to my schedule.
0:53
However, if we double click anywhere on our calendar,
0:57
we are brought to the full screen version of that event
1:01
where we have access to all of the different features
Input event details
1:05
and criteria.
1:06
And this is where I would recommend you get used
1:09
to both adding and editing your events.
1:12
So here I'm going to start by entering a title.
1:15
Let's say this is going to be a meeting with my friend Jen,
1:20
and then down below I can choose if I need to alter any
1:23
of the times.
1:25
Now, if I didn't choose the correct date, I can come in here
1:28
and select the correct date on this mini calendar selection.
1:33
And if I need to adjust the time, so for example,
1:36
maybe it's not going to last a full hour,
1:39
I'm going to come here and select
1:41
and reduce this to just a 30 minute meeting.
1:46
Now that my dates start
1:47
and end times are correct, I can then come down
1:50
and choose if this is going to be an all day event
1:54
and if it needs to repeat.
1:56
Now, the majority of your events are going
1:58
to fill a particular time slot,
2:01
but there will be occasions where maybe you are traveling,
2:05
maybe it's a birthday or some other all day event.
2:09
If that's the case, you're going to want
2:11
to check this checkbox.
2:13
By doing so, it will eliminate any of the times
2:16
that were currently listed up above.
2:19
But in my example, I'm going to leave it as this specific time
Repeat event settings
2:23
and maybe if I need to make this meeting reoccurring,
2:27
I can come here and select this does not repeat dropdown
2:31
and see the other options available to me.
2:34
Now it begins by giving me several choices such as daily,
2:38
weekly, monthly, and other options available.
2:42
But if none of these seem to fit what I am looking for,
2:46
I can come all the way down to the bottom
2:48
and select this custom option.
2:51
So for example, maybe I want to meet
2:53
with Jen twice a week, not only on Wednesdays,
2:58
but I also want to meet on Fridays as well.
3:01
So I'm going to select that day of the week here as well.
3:05
Down below, I need to choose when this recurrence will end.
3:10
By default never is selected, meaning
3:13
that this will continue to repeat week
3:16
after week after week.
3:18
But in most cases, you're going to want to set an end date.
3:22
I can either choose on, which means I will have
3:25
to select some date in the future.
3:28
Maybe this particular meeting is going to end at the end
3:31
of August or if I don't want to choose a particular date,
3:36
I can also select after meaning
3:39
after a number of occurrences.
3:41
So maybe I'm going to say
3:43
after nine occurrences,
3:45
that's when I want this repeat to finish.
3:48
When I'm happy with my changes here, I can select done
3:52
and it will give me a summary up here as well.
Video conference & location
3:55
Now down below we have a section called event details.
3:59
By default, you will see this button add Google Meet video
4:03
conferencing, meaning
4:05
that we can add a conferencing link directly to this event.
4:09
Now if you don't use Google Meet, that's fine as well.
4:13
You can always copy and paste a Zoom meeting link
4:17
or some other video conferencing link either in the location
4:20
or in the description area.
4:23
Speaking of location, it can be very valuable
4:26
to add a specific location to your events.
4:30
Let's say for example, I'm going to be meeting
4:32
with Jen at a local restaurant.
4:34
I'm going to come in here
4:35
and start to type in the name of that restaurant
4:39
and immediately Google will provide some suggestions.
4:42
Here's the one that I want,
4:44
and not only will it fill out the complete address,
4:47
but what makes it even more convenient is
4:50
that if I come all the way over here to the right
4:53
and select this preview in maps, it will show me exactly
4:57
where this restaurant is located.
4:59
So if I need to find my driving directions
5:02
or other information about where we're meeting,
5:05
I can have access to that.
5:06
Here on the right hand side of my screen, down
Notification settings
5:10
below location, we can choose to set a notification time
5:15
by default within my calendar.
5:17
I have it set for five minutes, meaning
5:20
that I will receive a reminder both here on my desktop
5:25
but also within my phone five minutes
5:28
before the start of this event.
5:30
Now maybe if I need to travel somewhere, I need
5:33
to give myself some additional time.
5:34
So let me go and change that to 20 minutes here.
5:38
You can also come down below
5:40
and add additional notifications if desired.
5:44
So for example, instead of just an alert,
5:47
I'm going to come up here and select email
5:49
and say that maybe two days in advance I'd like a reminder
5:54
sent to my email inbox
5:57
- About this particular event.
5:59
You can add up to five different types of notifications
6:03
for a single event,
6:04
and if you need to change this, you can come over here
6:07
to the X and remove it.
Calendar visibility
6:10
Next, we can choose as to
6:12
where this event will be displayed.
6:15
Now by default,
6:16
any new event will be displayed in your default calendar.
6:21
In my case, it's called Scott's calendar,
6:24
but if I select this dropdown, I could say
6:26
that this should be listed under my family calendar,
6:30
for example, and it will change
6:32
to the appropriate default color for that calendar.
6:36
If I go back to my Scott's calendar, not only can you see
6:39
that it's changed it to this purple,
6:41
but I could change it to another color if I wanted to,
6:45
something different than my default calendar,
6:48
but I find it's often most helpful
6:50
to keep the assigned color associated
6:54
with the respective calendar.
6:57
Then below our calendar option,
6:59
we can choose if we want this event to be shown as busy
7:03
or free.
7:04
Meaning are we still available for other meetings
7:08
or other appointments or do we want to show this as busy?
7:12
This is most relevant if you are going
7:15
to be sharing your calendar with anyone else so
7:19
that they can see your details
7:21
and see if someone else can book you at the same time.
7:25
And the dropdown next to it is very related.
7:28
Here we can say if we want to keep the default visibility,
7:33
which in my case happens to be public, meaning anyone
7:37
that I share my entire calendar with will be able
7:40
to see the details of this,
7:42
but if I want to keep it private, I could change it
7:45
to private here as well.
7:47
Again, these two options are only relevant if you are
7:51
sharing your calendar with colleagues
7:54
or other parties outside of your individual account.
7:58
And then lastly, on the left hand side of your screen,
8:01
you can add a description, you can paste in a link
8:05
or include a meeting agenda.
8:07
You can even come up here and add an attachment if you like.
Add guests
8:12
Now on the right hand side of the screen,
8:14
we have the opportunity to add guests to this event.
8:19
Of course, this is not a requirement,
8:22
but there are going to be many meetings
8:24
or appointments where you want to make sure
8:26
that others are invited
8:28
and that they have these same details which you have created
8:31
here by entering in your cursor
8:33
and starting to enter in an email address.
8:36
You will have access to your Google contacts
8:39
or you can simply type in a new address if you like.
8:43
All of your guests, including yourself
8:45
as the organizer will be listed down below.
8:48
So if you need to hover over
8:50
and find out more information, you can.
8:52
And if you need to remove any guests, you can come over here
8:55
to the right and select the x.
8:58
Down below we have three more options,
9:01
which we want to review.
9:03
And these are our guest permissions.
9:06
Do we want to allow our guests to modify this event?
9:10
I would say that in most cases you want
9:12
to leave this unchecked
9:14
and that only the organizer can modify the event,
9:18
but the next two may be more optional.
9:21
Maybe you want to allow others
9:23
to invite more people to this event.
9:26
If so, you can leave this checked.
9:28
And are you okay
9:29
with sharing the entire guest list With everyone else on the
9:34
list, you can choose to check or uncheck this option here.
9:39
When we're happy with making our changes, we can come up
9:41
to the top and hit that save button.
9:44
Now, in this example,
9:46
because I have included guests, I am prompted
9:49
with this message, would you like to send invitation emails
9:53
to Google calendar guests?
9:55
In most cases, you'll want to say send notifying them both
10:00
of this event and allowing them to add it directly
10:03
to their own calendar.
10:05
But perhaps you've already verbally agreed
10:08
with this individual
10:09
and you don't need to send an invitation.
10:12
You can choose this option here
10:14
or go back to editing if need be.
10:17
In my case, I am going to select send
10:20
and I am now brought back to my main calendar.
10:23
Here we can see it has created our new event
10:26
and it's even showing me the name of the location
Edit & delete events
10:29
beside it as well.
10:31
Now, if we ever need to go
10:32
and make changes, we can simply click on this event
10:35
and once again, we are brought to this mini view
10:38
of the event, come up to the top and select edit event,
10:42
and we are brought back to our full screen area here.
10:46
We can continue to make any changes
10:48
and then hit save when we are done.
10:51
Now, if we need to delete an event, once again, we're going
10:55
to select that and we can select the trash can item here.
10:59
Or if you happen to be in full editing mode, we can come up
11:03
to the more actions drop down
11:05
and select delete from the options available here.
11:08
Now there's one special thing to note when you go
11:11
to delete a recurring event.
11:14
Let's go into this event one more time
11:16
and I'm going to select delete From the more actions menu.
11:20
I'm going to be prompted with a new screen
11:23
that says Delete recurring event by default.
11:26
This event, the first option will be selected, meaning
11:31
that when I say, okay, it is only going
11:34
to delete this specific event
11:37
and not the other eight occurrences of this event.
11:41
Of course we have other options available here as well.
11:45
We can choose this and following events, meaning this
11:49
and all of the future events will be deleted,
11:52
or we can choose last option here.
11:54
And this is most relevant,
11:55
if you've selected an event in the middle of a recurrence,
11:59
this option will delete everything as a part of this event.
12:04
In many cases, you will only want to delete
12:07
or edit this specific event,
12:09
so you can leave this one selected and then select.
12:12
Okay, and now
12:14
because I have added guests, I can choose
12:16
to include an optional message.
12:18
If I like.
12:20
In my example, I'm going to say, don't send,
12:22
I'm brought back to my calendar.
12:24
You can see that this event has been deleted,
12:27
but if I go forward into the future, you can see
12:30
that my other occurrences of this event have remained.
Calendar views
12:33
Now that you're familiar with creating editing
12:36
and deleting events,
12:38
let's take a look at the different views
12:40
that we have available to us.
12:43
Currently I am viewing my calendar in the weekly view,
12:47
which is my preferred view,
12:49
but we have other options available to us.
12:52
If we come up to the top right hand corner
12:54
and select this dropdown, we can view a daily view,
12:59
we can view our weekly view, we can view a monthly view,
13:04
or we can also view an annual view.
13:07
This yearly view is perhaps not that helpful
13:10
for seeing anything on your calendar,
13:12
but it does make it easy to jump to a date in the future.
13:16
Lastly, we have the option to view a schedule view,
13:21
which will condense all of our events
13:23
or meetings into a more linear or list view.
13:28
Within the schedule view, you will only see dates
13:31
that actually have events listed.
13:34
So for example,
13:35
here you can see we have things on June 21st,
13:39
but then it jumps directly to June 24th, meaning
13:42
that I have no events scheduled
13:45
between the two dates in between.
13:47
And just like our other views, we can click on any
13:50
of these options here and see a preview or go in
13:54
and start to edit these events as well.
Bonus viewing tips
13:56
Now, a bonus tip
13:58
for viewing your calendar involves making use
14:01
of the mini calendar here on the left hand side.
14:04
If we take our cursor and click on a start date
14:08
and drag it to another date, we can see that stretch
14:12
of dates at any time.
14:14
Let's say for example,
14:15
I just want to see what's happening next weekend.
14:18
I'm going to click on the 15th
14:20
and I'm going to drag it to the 16th.
14:23
Now I am just viewing Saturday and Sunday.
14:27
What if I want to see the next two weeks together?
14:30
I'm going to click on the 16th
14:31
and drag it all the way to the 29th.
14:34
Now I've got a two week view in front of you.
14:37
So an advanced way to look at just
14:40
what you want using the mini calendar.
14:43
And an extra bonus tip is
14:45
to use the G key on your keyboard.
14:48
This will bring up a prompt called go to date
14:52
where you can type in any date in the past or future
14:55
and even use natural language.
14:58
So for example, I'm going to say next October,
15:01
I'm not even going to spell October as a whole,
15:03
and I'm going to hit enter on my keyboard
15:05
and it's immediately going to bring me to October.
15:09
I'm going to say G again,
15:11
and this time maybe I'm going to say February, 2026
15:15
and hit enter and immediately I'm brought to
15:18
that specific date.
15:20
Of course, if you always want to go back to today,
15:23
the easiest way to do so is to make use
15:25
of the today button here in the top left hand corner.
15:29
Lastly, when it comes to viewing your calendar, if you want
15:32
to maximize the amount of viewing space,
15:35
you can come up here to this hamburger menu,
15:38
select main menu,
15:39
and that will collapse your left hand side panel.
15:43
This will maximize your viewing of whatever view
15:46
that you are in,
15:47
and if you need to expand it again,
15:49
we can simply select it one more time.
Add multiple calendars
15:53
Next, let's take a look at
15:54
how we can create multiple calendars here
15:57
so we can manage multiple schedules
15:59
and also keep our interface nice and clean.
16:04
Here you can see that I have a number
16:06
of different calendars,
16:07
so I can separate my personal calendar from my family
16:11
calendar to my work calendar, and even my softball league.
16:16
This makes it nice and easy for me to see the distinction.
16:19
So for example,
16:20
here I have listed both my softball practices
16:23
and a game that I have coming up later this week.
16:27
But if I just want to focus on my main calendar,
16:30
I can always uncheck this calendar
16:33
and just focus on the tasks or the meetings at hand.
16:38
To create your own multiple calendars, we want
16:40
to come down here to other calendars
16:43
and select the plus button.
16:46
We have a number of options available to us here,
16:48
but what we want to select is create new calendar
16:53
that will bring us into our settings where we need
16:55
to give this new calendar a name.
16:58
Let's say, for example,
16:59
I've just joined a pickleball league, so I want
17:03
to create a pickleball calendar for all
17:05
of the things associated with that league.
17:08
I give it the name up here.
17:10
I can add a description if I want to,
17:12
but it's not necessary.
17:14
And then if this calendar happens to be specific
17:17
to a different time zone, then my default, I can choose
17:21
that here as well.
17:22
I'm going to go ahead and select create calendar,
17:25
and in just a few seconds,
17:27
it gives me a confirmation message at the
17:29
bottom of the screen.
17:31
By selecting the back arrow in the top left hand corner
17:34
of the screen, I'm returned to my calendar view,
17:38
and here we can now see on the left hand side,
17:40
I have a pickle ball calendar.
17:43
You will remember when we create our events,
17:45
we have the options
17:47
to choose which calendar we would like it to appear on.
17:51
So the next time I need to add a pickleball game,
17:54
I will make sure to assign it to that pickleball calendar.
17:58
And to make it even easier to distinguish the differences
18:01
between your multiple calendars, we can come over here
18:04
and select the more dots and change the colors.
18:08
For example, maybe I want to change my softball league to more
18:11
of this mustard looking color.
18:13
I can do so here.
Add other calendars
18:15
Lastly, it can be very helpful to add other calendars such
18:20
as local holidays, religious events,
18:23
or maybe other things that you're interested in.
18:26
Once again, we're going to select this plus button here,
18:29
and this time we're going to select browse calendars
18:33
of interest.
18:34
Here, Google has
18:36
provided us with a number of available options.
18:39
We can choose if we want to add contacts
18:43
that have birthday information displayed.
18:46
We can choose if we want to add regional holidays, either
18:49
for your own country
18:51
or maybe other countries as well down below a selection
18:55
of religious holidays
18:56
and even sporting events that you can add
18:58
to your calendar too.
19:00
Now, if you'd like to learn more advanced tips on how
19:03
to use Google Calendar,
19:04
I recommend you'd watch the playlist on the screen now,
19:08
and if you have further questions, be sure
19:10
to let me know in the comments down below.
19:13
Thank you so much for watching,
19:14
and remember, being productive does not
19:17
need to be difficult.
19:18
In fact, it's very simple.

1:52
the search button that you can use to literally search for anything that you want in your calendar and and you can
2:00
search for active calendars or all calendars so if I should select all
2:06
calendars and click on search I have no results because I don't
2:11
have any other things in my other calendars so I'm just going to leave it to the active
2:17
calendar and you can also in case maybe you are looking for you have a couple of TXS or event and you are looking for a
2:25
certain particular event you can enter the keyword that you want in that event
2:31

date of the event then you click on search okay now after you are done searching and everything and you want to
2:45
go back all you have to do is just click on this back button when you click on this it's going to take you back to your
2:53

2:58

3:11
tutorial is to take you through all of that so you don't have to go through it again but in case you want to read about
3:18
it you can just go ahead and read about it I'll leave the link in the description for instance let's say that
3:24
I want to learn by ro and Industry and I select Administrative Assistant
3:30
Google is going to give me some tips for how an administrative assistant should
3:35
manage their calendar so on this page you can manage you have resources for how to manage your voices calendar how
3:42

3:48
certain shortcut when you scroll down you are going to see more tool so you can take your time and then learn some
3:55
of them the next tutorial I'm going to talk about how to use chat do you want to subscribe to this channel so that you
4:02
don't miss any tutorial over here in settings maybe navigate to settings over
Google Calendar settings
4:08
here in your settings when you look under General there is language and region time zone word clock event
4:16
settings notification settings view options event from Gmail shortcut and
4:21
probably offline so you can do that over here with the language and region you
4:26
have English if you are speaking other languages you can you can use that as well and there is country which is Ghana
4:34
I am currently in Ghana there is also the date for month when you select date for mon you get opportunity to select
4:40
whichever one you want so we have the day the month and then the year with the
4:45
time format you can select either this 12 hours or this okay whichever one that
4:51
you prefer but I prefer to stick with the 12 hours okay now the time zone when
4:57
we scroll down to the time zone you can select it from here or you just scroll down from this side the time zone this
5:03
is my primary time zone normally Google Calendar is going to do that for you so you don't have to do any changes over
5:11
here and in case you want to display secondary time zone secondary time zone is like probably you are working in
5:17
another country time zone you can add their time zone over here so you're just
5:22
going to select the time okay I'm going to select
5:27
the time and add it to your Google Calendar so let me look for something
5:32
over here so now when you select this it's going to be added to your Google
5:38
calendar so whenever there is an event in this particular time zone you will be notified and you can work
5:46
accordingly now let's head over to the word clock as well you can show word clock on your Google calendar when we
5:53
head over to event settings the default duration for each event is is 1 hour
6:00
which is like 60 Minutes in case you want to extend the duration of that particular event you can make it either
6:07
90 minutes or 120 minutes but preferably an hour should be fine but if it's a
6:14
long meeting then probably you can make it 90 minutes maximum okay and then the
6:19
guest permissions in case you want to give permissions to your guest you can allow them invite others you can also
6:26
allow your guest to see the guest list but whenever you give them modify event
6:32
permissions it means that you are no longer in charge of the event that you
6:37
are organizing so it's always and always advisable to leave this box unchecked
6:44
over here you can also add invitations to your calendar now with the notification settings you can allow if
6:50
you're using a desktop or a laptop you can allow notifications just so you don't miss any event and you can set the
6:58
notification time to be 1 minute before you can do that all here and you
7:04
can view options as well you don't have to do anything over here because all these things are like default settings
7:12
but you can play around and see how that works for you as well now event from Gmail these are like events from Gmail
7:19
so Gmail can automatically create events that can be displayed on your calendar
7:24
so for instance if you are creating a schedule okay and you link your Google
7:30
calendar to that particular schedule you are creating and probably you are traveling or you're booking a hotel room
7:37
or restaurant reservations Google can assist you to keep track of all those
7:42
things in your calendar and you will you will be sent notification so that you don't forget okay and this is for only
7:50
you this is for only you you can make it private as well you can enable keyboard
7:56
shortcut keyboard shortcut always helps and you can view so when you turn on
8:02
offline calendar it means that you are still going to view your tax and event even though you are offline on your
8:09
Google calendar so if you want you can check this now over to we are just going to collapse this and then in case you
8:16
have other calendars that you might want to add you can do that from this option
8:21
first of all let's go to subscribe to calendar okay over here at subscribe to calendar you can subscribe to somebody
8:28
else's calendar if you have their email address you can do that over here you
8:33
just have to input the email address and then you follow the prompt now over here you can also create a new calendar so
create a new calendar in the settings
8:40
with the subscribe to calendar it's not something that is really important so
8:45
you can leave it out but the important thing here is the create new calendar okay in case you want to create a new
8:50
calendar you select create new calendar and then you input the name of the
8:55
calendar that you want so we are just going to say Google events
9:02
Google events okay and we can say that this is AD dami
9:09
calendar this is a dami calendar and you can select the time zone that you want
9:15
this particular calendar to be in then you create
9:22
calendar so now when you create the calendar over here you can see that it
9:27
has been created for you so this is how you go about creating other calendars
9:32
when we go back to our main calendar we will see it over there you can browse calendars of Interest by clicking on
9:38
this so when you click on this you can see Regional holidays so Regional holidays are holidays in your country
9:45
okay and over here I have my public holidays and other observations and when I select browse all you can see I can
9:52
browse other holidays in other countries as well so you can go through some of
9:58
these things now there's also Global religious holidays like Christian holidays Hindu
10:04
holidays Jewish holidays Muslim holidays and octad holidays you can check out
10:10
some of these things in case you want to see them popping on your calendar there is also Sports basketball football when
10:18
you click on that you can see all of this you go ahead to click on this and
10:23
then you can add them to your calendar if you are a huge football fan now in case you have other calendars that you
10:30
want to import to this particular calendar you can do that it's the same as creating a calendar so you can select
10:36
if you have it on your desktop you can do that but it's always advisable to
10:42
leave these things as they do not play any vital Ru in your calendar okay so
10:48
this is all that we have in our settings in case you want to play more around you can take your time and do that now let's
10:54
go back to our main calendar when we come back to our settings you realize
11:00
that the calendar that we created is over here in your calendar it has been added to your other calendars as well so
11:07
in case you want to change the color or the appearance of that particular calendar you're going to click on this
11:13
and you can also remember that the time the time that we added the other time that we added is also appearing here you
11:20
can see two time zones okay so this is how you can work effectively with Google
11:25
Calendar without any stress now when we come back to the settings the trash whenever you
11:31
delete an event it all appears here in your trash so over here in your trash
11:36
you can see the events that you've deleted but because this is a new calendar calendar you don't have any
11:43
deleted event we are going to go
11:49
back when we come back to the same settings and the drop down you see new
how to change calendar appearance
11:54
appearance so we going to click on new appearance and now the interesting thing thing is you can have your Google
12:00
calendar in dark mode light mode or device
12:05
default right so dark mode light mode or device default and the calendar set the
12:13
color set sorry the color set you can make it modern So currently we have
12:18
modern with white text and classic with black text it means that your text is
12:23
going to be black you wouldn't see anything so it's advisable to leave it with Mod with white text okay we click
12:32
on done let's go back to dark mode yes then we click on done and we
12:39
can go back to this so in case you you you've created an event and you want to
12:44
print it okay you can do that here and get add-ons get add-ons are like extensions that you can incorporate into
12:51
your Google calendar and use but this add-ons it works from everywhere these are like General add-ons and this are
12:58
business Essentials these are apps to discover so you can incorporate zoom in
13:04
your Google calendar so that whenever you have a zoom meeting it just pops up automatically on your calendar for you
13:11
and there is also some popular extensions like work GPT clickup
13:16
organizer 8 and8 work meetings and these are top rated this works with Google
13:23
Calendar okay the others that we looked at they are most popular this works from
13:28
every everywhere but there's no possibility that it works effectively with Google Calendar if you want things
13:35
that works with Google Calendar you can check this out you can see that this works with Drive okay so this works with
13:42
Google Calendar Microsoft teams gong and tax Band so let's explore tax Band and
13:49
in case you want before you download an extension you check the rating this has 2.5 which is not good and this has 4.9
13:57
3.0 but it has a lot of downloads okay so you can check the downloads the
14:03
rating and then you go ahead to you know have a look at all of them so let's screw down and see the one
14:11
that we can go with so it says re re for Gmail
14:18
re for Gmail it creates tax from emails and then easily picks our signes from
14:23
list of suggestions and work GPT
14:30
so work DPT is the AI Tools in your Google calendar so then let's go ahead
14:36
and explore with this you just click connect install click on
14:41
install then you go ahead to select an account you selecting an account is
14:47
basically you signing up so you can do that with your Google account okay and then you give access in
14:54
case you want to give it access to some of this T Google slid presentation so
14:59
you can do that but in case you're not comfortable you can just cancel it but will allow we will give it some time to
15:07
install and then we click on done so after installing it when you check this
15:12
side okay when you check on this tiny side let me expand this a
15:18
bit I'm sorry let me check on this side you can see it over here work DPT for workspace in case you want to use it you
15:25
tap on it so you can use it whenever you want all right so that is all about our
15:31
settings when you navigate your mouse to this section over here you can select the format in which you want your Google
15:38
calendar to appear in so we have day there is week there is month okay but I prefer
15:46
weak because it helps me to visualize my day-to-day activities more effectively
15:51
now you can switch to other calendar but this is currently not effective and you can switch to tax this is the most
how to create tasks in Google Calendar
15:58
important one okay so over here you can add tax by clicking on
16:03
this and then you can add the title so let's say that today we are learning about Google
16:10
Calendar learn Google Calendar okay and you can give it
16:17
more details by saying today you are doing this today when you click on these three dots over here you have options to
16:24
add to start add a sub tax or you can delete it or you can even add a new list
16:29
okay so when you add a sub tax it means that there are going to be other tax under the main one so let's see um learn
16:38
about settings and we can say that for
16:44
tomorrow you can use this to organize your tax without having to pay for other
16:50
apps to use Okay Google Calendar is all you have and it's the best now on this
16:56
portion over here when you are in your tax you can create tax from this portion
17:01
okay so you can add the title of the tax so this is how you create you go about creating your tax so we can say
17:09
Larn Google Calendar and then you can give out the
17:15
month the date of the month the time that you want to begin this particular
17:20
TX if it's an all day you do that if you don't want this TX to repeat itself you leave it because when you check the drop
17:27
down you can see that it can be repeated daily weekly on Sundays or monthly on
17:33
Day N and all that you can add a brief description and this is tax so you leave
17:38
it at tax okay then you click on Save and when you click on save it will be
17:43
added over here so you see all your TXS over here so you have two options whenever you are creating your TX you
17:49
can either use this portion to create TX which is here you click on ADD tax you
17:55
go ahead to add it or you come over here to create and then you create your new
18:00

are you tired of juggling a million to dos and  
0:02
still missing appointments well I  was too so that's why I use Google
0:06
Calendar hi I'm Jamie and welcome to teachers  Tech today I want to show you how to use Google  
0:16
Calendar this is a beginner's tutorial so I'll  start with the basics but then by the end of this  
0:21
I want you to feel confident in using this to keep  your life organized to use Google Calendar you  
Get Google Calendar
0:27
will need a Google account I'm demoing this today  from my Google workspace account something I pay  
0:33
for but if you go ahead and create a free Google  account you'll be able to access many of the same  
0:39
features I'm going to go ahead and open Google  Calendar I'm already logged in and if I go up to  
0:44
the Google apps here and just click on it you'll  notice you have options to all the different apps  
0:49
that you can use from Google I have calendar right  here you can drag these around maybe it's in a  
0:54
lower spot but you can drag it to where you want  if you want to access it very quickly I'm going  
0:59
to go ahead and open this up let's do a quick walk  around of what we see here let's start in the top  
1:05
leftand Corner this is the main menu that opens  this up if I click this again it closes expands  
Layout and appearance
1:11
the calendar in the middle I'm just going to open  this back up I'll talk about these things under  
1:16
the main menu in a bit now if I keep going across  I can navigate to the next months very quickly you  
1:21
can see how I adjust but if I ever want to jump  back to today's date just go ahead and click  
1:26
this and it jumps back in a hurry you can see how  today's date is indicated with the blue circle on  
1:31
my calendar now if I keep going across we have  a search and we have a settings menu with the  
1:37
settings menu I want to point out the appearance  this is a new feature with Google Calendar if I  
1:43
click appearance I can quickly change it to  a dark theme or device uh device default here  
1:49
too I can uh drop down and go to com compact or  responsive to my screen which I'm going to keep  
1:55
in that I'm going to keep with a dark screen just  for this tutorial I'll go back to light and and  
2:00
hit done now under this dropdown you can change  your view of your calendar so right now I have it  
2:06
under month but if you wanted a week you can see  how it adjusts and how the day indicated you can  
2:12
jump back and forth to any of these to look at the  year and adjust it to the way you want now we do  
2:18
have other options down here where it show decline  events show completed task and show appointment  
2:24
schedules I'm just going to go back to the month  view right now this is highlighted because we're  
2:30
on the calendar view but this is switched to task  and if you're using your Google uh calendar task  
2:37
is a big part of it to help stay organized so  I will spend time talking about uh adding your  
2:42
task to your calendar and creating them let's jump  back to calendar view and I want to point out this  
2:48
little calendar over here so it works similar  I can go to next months just like I showed you  
2:53
before with the big one but if I click on a day in  here it will jump to that big calendar here and if  
3:00
I click on it again it will actually go to the day  and now I'm in day view so on no matter what day  
3:05
I click on it will be in day view here but you can  adjust that back up top by going to the month if I  
3:12
keep moving down here you're going to see where I  can search meet with specific people that I'd have  
3:17
in my contacts that would show up here I have time  insights this is part of my workspace uh here that  
3:23
my workspace account that I pay for you won't  see this in the free one and we have different  
3:27
calendars that I have and I'm going to show you  how to add more or unsubscribe from the ones that  
3:33
you have I added some examples to the calendar  just to demonstrate my Calenders over here notice  
Showing different Calendars, Birthdays and Tasks
3:39
if I check this off birthdays goes away if I  uncheck this the task goes away and now nothing's  
3:46
showing and I can check them one at a time but  if you have a long list of calendars you might  
3:51
want to just choose those three little dots and  say display this only and then it's going to just  
3:55
go to the one now the other thing I want to point  out is with birth dates this isn't like a normal  
4:01
event you're not adding it to a calendar this is  connected through your contacts so maybe you've  
4:07
put it into your Google account as a contact and  this is where that's pulling that information so  
4:11
if I click on contacts over here notice that under  this demo Jamie I have a birthday of November 15th  
4:18
and that's why it's showing up in here so if you  want to add birth dates to this you need to add  
4:23
it to your contacts now the other thing I want to  point out we have task and you can see I have a  
4:29
pending task and a Google forms task I showed you  up top here we have switch to task view that was  
4:35
because this one had a date on it notice 6 days  ago if I just go back to uh this view I can also  
4:42
get to the task over here so if I click on it this  is just a different way you can look at the task  
4:48
and then each of these can have a date applied to  them and I'll show you more about that in a bit  
4:53
but I just want to make sure that you understand  the different views of my calendar before I start  
Adjusting Google Calendar Settings
4:58
adding events and ask I just want to point out  some of the settings up here so I'm going to  
5:03
go to the settings menu and choose settings if you  go at this point you can choose your language your  
5:08
country your date format your time format you can  add your time zone in here and as you go through  
5:16
when we go ahead and add our events I have mine  default to 60 minutes and you'll notice that come  
5:21
up when I add them but you can change your default  durations at this point we have our notifications  
5:28
so how do you want to be alerted when your  different events come up so if I drop down  
5:33
you can have them on or off at this point so if  you want to turn them off this is where you would  
5:38
go and on the calendar how do you want it to look  so we right now I have show weekend show declined  
5:44
events show completed task you can turn these  offer on so if I wanted this off show weekends if  
5:50
I go back notice that I have Monday through Friday  here and the weekends are gone you can go back to  
5:58
your settings and just turn that back on by simply  clicking it again so go through and take a look at  
6:04
the different settings that you have available  through here that you can quickly add I'll  
6:09
come back to some of these a bit later the other  thing I want to point out if you have a certain uh  
6:16
window you want to see using the little calendar  if I'm in November and let's say you can see I  
6:21
have the 13th 14th 15th if I highlight the 13th  14th 15th over here and let go it automatically  
6:28
goes to those three days if I highlight a week it  will go to that view so just a quick way that you  
6:35
can adjust your views by using the little calendar  and selecting how many days now I want to show you  
Creating and editing events
6:40
a few different ways that you can create events  and tasks in Google Calendar to create an event or  
6:47
task we can go over to create and if I drop down  you'll notice we have event here we have task if  
6:52
you're using the free version of Google Calendar  you're not going to see these three options right  
6:57
here now if I go also if I close the main menu we  can get to event and task right through here as  
7:04
well I'm going to open this back up here uh just  to go through this way so I'm going to go and  
7:09
create an event and for me an event is something  like a meeting or somewhere I have to be at a task  
7:16
over here I can switch also at this point would be  something I need to get done but I'll let you sort  
7:22
that out what works best for you I'm going to go  to an event and let's say this is meeting with Jim  
7:28
now the other thing that you'll probably want  to do right away when's the time so if I click  
7:33
on this you'll notice that the calendar pops up  we'll say this is going to be next Tuesday what's  
7:39
the time it's going to be so if I drop down I can  adjust the time period in here let's say this is  
7:45
going to be an hour 2 to 3 p.m. if I look at this  I'll move this down a bit you'll notice that it's  
7:50
already on my calendar it doesn't stay there till  I hit save though if I exit out it's going to ask  
7:55
me to discard this if this is an all day meeting  with Jim I would check this and notice how this  
8:01
is going to change the look here but I'll just  leave it as uh as this time 2 to 3 I'm going to  
8:07
create another event in a moment with somebody  else but I want to point out this is a quick way  
8:12
that you can add it so if I hit save this is on  my calendar right now but let's say we want to  
8:19
create a different type of a different event I  can just go to the day that I want so let's say  
8:24
if it's going to be on the on December 9th if I  just click on this the same ad event comes up and  
8:31
notice I can change right through here as well so  maybe this is going to be a meeting with uh we'll  
8:37
say with Drew and I will leave this as an event  and I'm going to go ahead and add time notice it  
8:44
already has the correct date because that's the  date I clicked on if I add time I can go ahead  
8:49
and pick a time from here just like I showed you  before the other thing I want to point out is that  
8:55
we have more options now more options is going to  open up everything at at once and uh just so you  
9:01
can see and put uh it has all the same options  just a different view to it so I still have my  
9:07
time in here do I want this to repeat so if it's  something that's going to happen every week I can  
9:13
go ahead and say weekly on Monday and it's going  to add it to my calendar on those every Monday I'm  
9:18
just going to leave this as does not repeat but  you can see all the different options that you  
9:23
could put in you could put an event as a birthday  and have it repeat annually that day if you want  
9:29
to go through if you weren't using your contacts  but I'll leave it does not repeat we have our  
9:34
event details now is this going to be a in person  or maybe you need to add a Google meet to this if  
9:40
I click on this this will add a link uh that the  person will be able to click right in here so now  
9:48
they have a link that they'll be able to join  and notice that we have different options uh  
9:53
when we open it up we can see through here now if  I keep going down is there a location well this is  
9:58
virtual so it won't matter but you could actually  put a location in here and it will go find it so  
10:04
if I start typing in Los Angeles it comes up in  here and that would be the location I'm going to  
10:10
leave this blank notification I'm going to show  you how to set notifications uh too so you uh  
10:16
from your settings but do you want to get notified  this about 10 minutes usually I have mine set for  
10:21
about 10 minutes before if I drop down you'll see  that I can change the color so maybe meeting with  
10:27
Jim I have it as a different color just so I can  recognize it uh do I want it to be busy yes I do  
10:33
and this you can even add some more uh information  down here is there meeting notes so I could go  
10:38
ahead and add meeting notes to this I could go  to my Google Drive I could go grab something from  
10:44
here and insert it and it puts it in and I can  just add a description to this in here so now once  
10:52
I get everything set up another important thing is  is to add uh different people to this so if I go  
10:59
add Drew here this is going to be going over  to their calendar this is important thing cuz  
11:04
I'm going to bring his calendar and show you what  he gets now I'm going to go hit save do I want to  
11:09
send invitation emails yes I do so I'm going to go  hit send and I'm going to invite all guests even  
11:16
though I know they're outside my organization  and I'm going to create and share because the  
11:21
documents need to be shared with this person and  I'm just going to say share with people here save  
11:27
event share anyway and now that is going to be set  here is the meeting with Drew notice the color on  
11:34
it let me bring over his calendar here I am in  the demo email this Drew person if I click on  
11:40
the email you can see I got an invitation am I  going to go so this is as Drew I can say these  
11:46
different options I'll hit yes and notice that it  was showing me that we have our attachments and  
11:52
notes in here as well if I check out his calendar  we have this meeting on December coming up so if  
11:59
I click on it from his perspective I can see who  the organizer is who's going to it the different  
12:05
notes and when the person is joining we can join  by Google meet right here when I come back to my  
12:12
calendar and click on this now notice that there's  this little check mark beside Drew this is telling  
12:18
me that he said yes so this is a great way of  keeping track of people by sending invites to  
12:24
other people then you can just check who's going  to be attending those meetings another way you  
12:30
might create an event is a multiple day now I  could go ahead just like I showed you before  
12:34
click on any date I can go ahead and pick multiple  days on this so if it's going to go from December  
12:41
10th to December 13th and we'll call this a golf  trip here that I need to plan I can maybe have it  
12:48
a different color drop down just to identify  something personal I can invite the people I  
12:54
don't think I'll need a Google meet for this I'll  hit save and so I can have it go over multiple dat  
12:59
at any point you can edit these events that you  have so if this is going to change I could do  
13:06
it a few different ways I could drag it to a  different spot so even something like this I  
13:12
can drag it I can click on it once and I'll get  to the information but I can edit at this point  
13:19
so let's say this meeting I already moved it  one day but now this needs to be have a Google  
13:24
meet connection I can click to add that and  that's going to be part of it and I can make  
13:29
an adjustment well this is going to be all day and  hit save and now this is updated if we're moving a  
13:36
date that's connected with somebody else if let's  say we even move this to a different day they're  
13:41
going to update send emails to those people to get  them notified so this is a great thing so if you  
13:47
if you do it you don't have to go and send those  out it'll automatically do it once I hit send and  
13:53
they're going to get the update on their calendar  if I was selecting multiple dates too I can simp  
13:59
drag across any of these and then it's going to  open up with the information to put in if you  
Creating and editing tasks in Google Calendar
14:04
need to remove any of these events you can click  on them go to the delete event right here you can  
14:10
also just rightclick on these different events  and click delete if you ever wanted to change  
14:15
the label color so if you didn't want it be blue  I could change this to a different color and it  
14:19
quickly adjust you can also use contrl Z to undo  your last step so if I press contrl Z notice it  
14:26
goes back to what it was before with blue now the  other thing that I wanted to show you was adding  
14:32
task so I can go over to create and I can create  my task this way or I can click on the date like  
14:39
I showed you before and just move over to task  and let's say I need to buy dog food for this  
14:45
and to me that's kind of a task I item I might put  it in so I could add a description I don't think  
14:51
I need one for this I understand what the task is  going to be but I can change the time and so maybe  
14:56
I want to change it towards the end of a workday  or a certain time I'm know I know I'm going to be  
15:01
somewhere so maybe I'll put at 5:00 p.m. I'll know  I'm going to be leaving work and I'm just going to  
15:06
put save so this gets identified here as dog food  and I'll get a notific notification uh before that  
15:14
time maybe 10 minutes now if I go up to the task  which the task up here I could also add task this  
15:21
way so if I click on add task and I'll say by  uh birthday present so I'll just say like this  
15:29
I can add details and I'll just say maybe it's for  Keegan I'll add a date or time this is going to be  
15:35
in December we'll say on the 21st I'll hit okay  and now when I switch back over to the calendar  
15:41
view notice here it is over here and I can drag  these around just like I showed you before and  
15:48
the task gets updated with the date now the other  thing I want to point out these are always blue  
15:53
so if I right click on it I can't change the  color this way but if I go over to task here  
15:59
here in options if I said you know what I want my  task to be purple now this one dot got this since  
16:05
it's a timed one got changed to purple and this  one got changed to purple now task will go away  
16:11
when you complete them so if I rightclick is one  way I could do Mark as complete so if I click it  
16:17
off it gets uh strike through like this and if I  want to delete it or uncomplete it I can turn it  
16:24
back if I go to task up here any of these ones I  can check off off here so now if I go back you'll  
16:31
see that it gets crossed off this way but I can  also go to task over here and if I say click here  
16:38
then this is going to be uh taken off with that  strike through here but anytime you can go back  
16:43
and just put it on as uncompleted so tasks are  a great way to keep everything organized I love  
Create a bookings page in Google Calendar
16:50
this new feature in Google Calendar right here the  appointment schedule and this is in the free or in  
16:56
the workspace like I'm in right now you're able to  create a booking page share it out and people can  
17:01
select a time that you've set up and then those  bookings spots will disappear as people sign up so  
17:08
if I click on this will set one up really quickly  and I'll just say this is schedule a meeting the  
17:13
appointment duration right now if I look over here  you can see they're all booked as an an hour on  
17:18
those 5 days I could say you know what these are  45 minutes I don't want to do this on a Monday and  
17:24
I don't want to do this on a Friday uh will even  take off this day and I can start to even adjust  
17:30
times you can see how everything is uh modifying  to uh what I want for the bookings over here as  
17:38
I go down there's a scheduling window so is it  available now start and end dates uh maximum time  
17:44
in advance you can set up when people can start  booking or the minimum time before uh booking  
17:49
appointment settings so if you want to have a  buffer time in between so if I click on this now  
17:55
it's set up 30 minutes in between so maybe I don't  want quite 30 minutes maybe I only want 15 minutes  
18:02
and then there'll be a 15 minute buffer time in  between so you can see the different settings you  
18:07
can uh just simply click in here maximum bookings  per day or invite allow guests to invite others  
18:13
you can choose what calendar this is going to  go on as well or add co-host I'm going to just  
18:19
hit next so we uh have a booking page phone and  name I'm not changing this but this is just hooked  
18:25
to my Google Google Calendar I could manage that  if I want location and conferencing I could even  
18:32
add a description here so I'll just say scheduled  meeting a booking form so this is the information  
18:38
that's going to show up uh that tells them to give  this information so right now it's the just the  
18:44
first name last name e uh an email I can add more  so let's say if I wanted to add a phone number I  
18:50
could actually do custom as well but I'll just  say add phone number and I can click it to make  
18:55
it required so this is going to be on the form  there's a payment and can cancellation policy and  
19:01
also booking confirmation and reminders so you can  see how that is going to be emailed out I'm going  
19:07
to go ahead and hit save so I'm going to go if I  open I could share right from here but if I open  
19:13
the booking page now it will show me this and  so I can share this out and people are going to  
19:20
be able to click on a spot to book and notice so  I put this into the form the phone number uh you  
19:27
could add a c some custom information as well so  I'm just logged in as myself right now so I'm just  
19:32
going to hit book and then I'll hit close and then  you can see how this is highlighted off now and it  
19:39
only shows the ones that are still available so  again if you want to share this out we can Click  
19:45
Share uh do we want to give it as a link as it is  right here I could copy this and email this out to  
19:51
people or I could do a website invite so this is  a great feature in the workspace or the free vers  
19:59
of Google Calendar now I want to show you how  you can manage your calendars by creating new  
Creating a new calendar and sharing
20:04
ones or even subscribing to others and then go  ahead and delete them after as well so right  
20:10
now we only have these three different items  in the calendars like I showed you before and  
20:14
birthdays wasn't really a calendar it was just  more connected to your contacts let's say I want  
20:20
to go ahead and add a new calendar if I click  the plus here I have some options let's start  
20:26
with create a new calendar and then I'm going to  show you how to subscribe to other calendars like  
20:30
maybe your favorite sports team but I'm going to  go create a new calendar and this is going to be  
20:35
for family events so maybe it's going to be for  family dinners or get togethers um I'm going to  
20:41
just call it family I'm not going to worry with  the description of this one uh once I get that  
20:46
all correct I'm just going to hit create calendar  and you're going to notice over here so right now  
20:51
I have my Jamie ke birthday dates and now I have  family I'm in settings right now it took me over  
20:57
to settings so if I go back another way I could  get to this if I go up to settings up top here  
21:03
you'll notice that as I go down here we have our  ad calendar and this is where I can go ahead and  
21:09
create a new calendar or subscribe to calendars  here as well so inside this now I have these three  
21:16
different ones now I could also create a birthday  calendar if I wanted to do it this way uh and now  
21:23
then I could add birth dates to it so the options  are a little different when I create my events so  
21:28
if I go ahead and let's say on December 16th  I have a dinner for family and I I'll just put  
21:34
dinner just as a title and I I want this to go  to my family calendar and it's not noticeable uh  
21:41
quickly but now when I click on my Jamie Keat  because this is the calendar from over here I  
21:47
get options and this wasn't here before because  I didn't have any other calendars when I click  
21:51
on it I can choose what calendar this is going to  be on so if I say family now it's going to switch  
21:57
over to that calendar I can go and let's say We'll  add it quickly at our time I won't change anything  
22:04
I'm just going to hit save so we have this dinner  right here if I uncheck family notice it's gone so  
22:11
that's how you add specific events to a specific  calendar that you created if you want to uh share  
22:19
your calendar with other people we can go back and  we click on those three dots we have settings and  
22:25
sharing this just brings me right back to uh to  the settings like I showed you the other way to  
22:31
get to this and we have different options so this  is what I created here and if I move down I can  
22:37
add people in groups so if there's other people  so even if you're on the free one if you wanted  
22:41
to share this calendar with other people in your  family you could add those people and then they're  
22:47
going to get access to that so when I go ahead  and add people let's say if I added a different  
22:52
account what permissions do I want them to have  so if I go and uh only want them to view and not  
23:00
to make changes I would pick one of these but if  you want them to make changes to events or make  
23:04
changes in management sharing you can give that  to them then they'll be able to add events as well  
23:10
so it will update your calendar so something you  need to take advantage of having those calendars  
23:15
and sharing them with other people so if I move  all the way down now I just want to point out if  
23:20
you wanted to delete a calendar so I'm under  this family calendar I can go ahead and click  
23:26
delete and that calendar would be gone let's say  now I want to add holidays and a favorite sports  
Adding special interest calendars (Sports Team)
23:34
team so I'm going to go and click the plus and  I'm going to click browse calendars of interest  
23:40
at this point you'll notice that we have holidays  and when I drop down it's going to show all these  
23:45
different countries and if I was looking for the  United States it's going to be towards the bottom  
23:49
this is all alphabetical here as I go down to the  very bottom you can see right here if I go at this  
23:56
point and stretch these out I can un check certain  days if I don't want them there if I keep moving  
24:02
down you'll see that we have different sports  and let's say I wanted to follow the Detroit  
24:06
Lions because they're having a great year so I can  go to football I'm going to go to NFL I'll look  
24:12
for the Detroit Lions and I have that selected  on the side notice all the different calendars  
24:17
that I have showing up right now let's go back a  step and if I take a look at the calendar I can  
24:23
see I have Christmas uh showing up and Christmas  Eve New Year's I have a Detroit liing game right  
24:29
on the 30th here same thing with the other ones  if I uncheck it goes away uh from it from there  
24:36
and we can also change our color so if I wanted  Christmas to show up in green I can make those  
24:41
quick changes at any point if you want to hide  these calendars so if I go to hide from list it  
24:48
didn't delete it it's just hiding it I'll show you  where we can unhide them again if we go back to  
24:55
uh settings on this one we have the holiday days  in the United States see how this is sh calendar  
25:01
list and it's hidden if I click it now it will  show if you want to unsubscribe all you have to  
25:07
do is remove the calendar at the very bottom it's  just like delete one I can click unsubscribe and  
25:12
it's going to remove it from the list on there  so now I only have the holidays and I don't have  
25:17
the Detroit Lions anymore so if I go back you'll  see the options there on the side if you're using  
Google Workspace calendar keyboard shortcuts
25:24
Google in work if you're using Google Calendar  in workspace you get a few different options like  
25:30
I mentioned before you can set a focus time so a  focus time you could pick a certain time and then  
25:36
you're not going to be interrupted so you could  mute chat notifications automatically decline  
25:41
meetings the other thing you can do is Mark an  out of the office so if you're out of the office  
25:48
on a certain day you can pick that time and it's  going to show up in your calendar that you're out  
25:53
of the office and you can automatically decline  meetings and you can ALS also have your working  
25:59
location shown so if I was going to pick maybe a  day or two days if I pick multiple days here and  
26:07
all day let's say I'm at home I'll hit save and  I'll hit okay now on my calendar it goes across  
26:13
that I marked at home like any of the other ones  I can open them back up and delete it if I don't  
26:19
want that there anymore did you know there were  shortcuts in Google Calendar here's an example if  
26:26
I just press C on my key board it goes to create  event if I press y it automatically goes to the  
26:33
year view if you're wondering where do you find  out about where all these shortcuts are just hit  
26:39
the question mark on your keyboard and you'll  see all the different shortcuts here that you  
26:44
can learn about that will save you a lot of  time when you're using Google Calendar the  
Google Calendar on mobile devices
26:49
last thing that I want to point out is to make  sure that you install the Google Calendar app  
26:54
on your mobile device once you do that and log  in the same account that you're logged into on  
27:00
your computer it will sync across so whether you  enter the information whether it be an event or  
27:05
a task on your phone or on your PC you're always  going to stay on top of it and organized let me  
27:12

Don't forget to like and subscribe. Hi everyone. Welcome to our Google Gmail Fundamentals course.
Introduction
0:11
My name is Elissa Smith. Now this course is designed for anyone who is looking to maximize
0:17
the use of their Gmail account. Not only are we gonna show you how to create a Gmail account and also use it,
0:25
filter it, sort it, even label your Gmail. But we're also going to spend some time showing you other great features
0:31
that come with a Gmail account, like the chat feature, and your Google Calendar, and also your Google Contacts.
0:38
So please join us on this journey while we really learn to maximize your experience with Google Gmail.
Creating a Gmail Account
0:47
Hi everyone. In this lesson I wanna show you how to create your own Gmail account. So I'm gonna be using, uh, Google Chrome for this session because of course
0:56
that's what Gmail would like us to do. So I'm gonna come in and actually search for my Google site to
1:04
perform a search to find Gmail. Now that I'm at the Google search site, I can go ahead and come right
1:09
here and do a search for Gmail. This is going to either log me into an existing Gmail account, or it's going
1:16
to give me an option to actually go in and create a Gmail account of my own notice here in the middle, I can create a personal Gmail account, or I can
1:25
attribute a Gmail account to work also. Same options in the top right now. A little bit of background on what Gmail is, it's Google's free
1:33
web-based email hosting service. It was actually launched in 2004, invitation only, and
1:38
then made public in 2009. The thing you need to understand is that when you sign up for a Gmail account,
1:44
you're also getting a Google account, which is awesome because it gives you access to Google's online services like Google Docs, sheets, slides.
1:54
Calendar, Google meets along with additional tools. Now, a Google account also can sometimes be attributed to
2:01
what's called Google Workspace. Google Workspace is actually an online productivity and collaboration application
2:08
suite that Google also created. It actually started back in 2006. It was rebranded to the G Suite in 2016, and now in October
2:18
of 2020, it's officially been called the Google Workspace. This course is gonna focus, of course, on Gmail, but just know that sometimes
2:26
when you have Gmail, you may also have access to the Google Workspace, which gives you even more tools, especially if you're using Gmail as a tool for work.
2:35
For email at work. Now, what I'm gonna do is come right here to create account, and it's going to take
2:41
me to where I need to provide a name. This won't necessarily be my Gmail name because remember, there are
2:48
2 billion Gmail users, so many of these names have been used up. Notice it makes suggestions for you.
2:56
What I would suggest here is continue trying different combinations until
3:01
you find one that will work, and sometimes it takes a few tries. Once you do, you'll see that there's no red involved down here.
3:10
You need to provide a password. Remember that these passwords are going to be case sensitive and they are
3:17
encrypted, so don't lose your password. The next screen is gonna ask you for information for a recovery email, your
3:25
birthday, your gender, and after that your Gmail account's going to be created.
3:30
Stay with me and come to the next lesson so we can actually start learning to use our email.
Logging In and Navigating
3:39
Hi everyone. We're ready to log into my Gmail account. So what I'm gonna do is come into my Chrome browser, type
3:46
in Gmail, up in my URL bar. This will take you to your login screen for your Gmail account.
3:53
Now that the account's been created, I can get into it. So I'm gonna come here to the top right hand corner, click on sign
3:59
in, and then of course I'll type in my Gmail address that I created.
4:06
And then my password. Remember, the passwords are encrypted, they're case sensitive, and don't give
4:12
them out to anyone because you don't want them to have access to your Gmail. Once I'm in my Gmail account.
4:20
Let's take a minute and look at how easy it is to navigate in this area. So a couple of important features in the Gmail interface on the top left hand
4:29
side, below the back button, and the U R L bar of whatever browser you're using.
4:34
Because remember, you can use Gmail with just about any browser. So Edge, Firefox, Chrome, safari.
4:41
We're using Chrome because of course this is a Google tool, but right here you're gonna see that it shows me I'm in Gmail.
4:48
And then to the left of that, I have a main menu button. It looks like three horizontal lines.
4:55
This is giving me access to the different areas of my Gmail. I can actually, uh, collapse this menu down by clicking on the three
5:03
horizontal lines, or click on it again to make it full size later on. We're going to explore this menu, but basically what you're seeing are the
5:10
different areas of your Gmail where you can store your email content. Now in the top right hand corner, we're also going to see some additional tools
5:19
to help me manage my Gmail account. In the very top right, I will see the initial of the account name.
5:25
When I click on this, it shows me the account I'm logged into. Some people have multiple Gmail accounts, so it's nice to make
5:32
sure you're in the correct one. There's also an option here to take you back to the original personalizations
5:38
that you made to your Gmail account. So if you click here on manage your Google account, because remember your
5:44
Gmail is part of your Google account, it will open up a separate browser tab where you can go back and make changes to your Google account itself.
5:53
We're gonna close that and go back to the Gmail back in the original again tab, representing my Gmail account.
6:00
In addition to, again, the button letting me access my Google account, I'm also going to see right here, a little tile that allows me to get to the other apps
6:09
that are part of my Google account. This is going to include things like Google Meet the calendar tool and even
6:16
Google Drive, which we do have classes on. By the way, to the left hand side of that, you're going to see the settings
6:23
gear, and this is where you can go in and really customize how your Gmail account looks, which is something that we will do in just a few minutes.
Composing and Reading Messages
6:34
Hi everyone. Welcome back. I'm actually ready to start reading some of my Gmail and also create
6:39
my first email message and send it from my new Gmail account. So right now I'm in my Gmail account.
6:45
You can see that I've actually started to receive some income messages. I'm gonna close this for right now so we can just focus on how to.
6:53
Open up a message that's come into my Gmail inbox. One of the easiest ways is to go to the message.
7:00
When it's in bold, it means it hasn't yet been read or you haven't yet clicked on it. When it's not bold, that means that you've already focused on it.
7:08
So I'm just gonna double click on the message and you'll notice that with a single click or a double click, the message will open.
7:14
This is gonna show me some important information. The top shows me who the message is from, including their email address,
7:21
then the actual text or content of the email or Gmail in this case. And then I can read down and at the bottom it even provides me
7:29
with reply and forward options. But right now we're just focusing on how to read the incoming mail.
7:35
Now, to go back to my inbox, I have a couple of different options. One of them is this back button at the top left corner of the message.
7:43
I could also come in after I've opened a message up and click over here in the navigation pane on my inbox, and that would just close the message
7:51
and take me back to my inbox list. Now, how do you create a new Gmail that you're going to send to someone?
7:58
Well, in the top left corner there is a pose button you can also do on your keyboard.
8:03
Keyboard shortcuts. But for this one, we're gonna use the pose button and it opens up a new.
8:08
Message box. Now, in the top right hand corner, you're gonna see that you have minimized full screen and close buttons.
8:15
I'm gonna go ahead and go into full screen mode just so that we can focus on this new message box.
8:20
The first thing I see is that my cursor is blinking in the two field. So I'm gonna go ahead and type in the two.
8:26
Notice right here in the top right hand corner, you also have a CC for carbon copy or a bcc, which stands for blind Carbon copy.
8:35
Blind carbon copy would allow you to send that email message to someone. But everyone else that the message is being sent to would not see
8:43
that person's name as one of the recipients of the email. Subject line is, of course, what the message is about,
8:52
and it's good email ethics to always send some sort of a subject line with your message.
8:59
And then I'm typing in the body of my email at this point.
9:15
Now notice at the very bottom of the message, I also have a formatting toolbar,
9:21
and then in addition, tools help me add extra information to the message. But when I'm ready to send it off, I'm just gonna click on the send button and
9:30
the message will be sent through the internet to that person's email account. It doesn't have to be a Gmail account.
9:36
That's the beauty of Gmail. It works great with all other email applications. So we've just sent our first message.
9:44
Come to the next lesson because we're going to look at how you can send messages with attachments and also do forwards and replies.
Customizing Gmail with Quick Settings
9:53
Hi everybody. We're ready to customize our Gmail account with a tool called Quick Settings.
9:59
To get to your quick settings, you wanna go to the top right hand corner and look for the cog with a black border.
10:05
This is the Settings button, and really it's where you make your customizations to how your Gmail works and how it looks.
10:12
When I click right here, you'll see that the top section allows me to deal with the chat and meet features of my Google account, which I'm
10:19
not quite ready for yet, but I am gonna come down and look at Density. This is how much space is between each of the messages.
10:27
You'll see here there's a choice to do Compact makes the messages have a lot less space between them.
10:33
I'm gonna keep mine comfortable so I have a little extra room. There are also some really fun themes that you can apply to your Gmail account,
10:41
and just notice that you can even bring in your own photos here, or if you scroll down under themes, you can even go in and find images that are provided
10:49
by Microsoft and they actually become the background of your Gmail account.
10:54
Kind of make things look a little bit fun. Now. In addition to that, I can also come in and you'll notice that I
11:00
have different settings for how the incoming email is sorted. Now, the default is what I have right now, but I could also make it
11:08
so messages that have an important setting would be at the top, or unread messages would always be at the top.
11:15
I also have an option to create a priority inbox or even have multiple inboxes.
11:21
This is nice if you have maybe multiple emails that are coming into your Gmail account. I'm gonna go ahead and keep mine with the default.
11:29
Now, one of the things I really like in here that you can also apply is a reading pane. Many different email applications, user reading Paine, but you'll see
11:38
right here that I can have my reading pane appear on the right hand side. You'll notice how it reloads.
11:44
This allows me when my reading pain is open to actually see the message. On the right, there's a divider bar between that I can drag
11:51
to the right or to the left. And this reading pane also, if you go up to the top and come down to the reading
11:57
pane can be placed at the bottom as well. For right now, I'm gonna keep mine turned off.
12:02
The final option you'll have in here is the ability to see your messages in a conversation view.
12:07
This is great when you have email threads and an email thread is where a message has been responded to and forwarded multiple times.
12:14
So there are multiple emails in involved in the thread, and you'll see that by default, the conversation view is turned on.
12:20
I highly recommend it. So again, remember that the quick settings really allow you to make customizations
12:27
to your Gmail so it's more comfortable for you to use the way you would like.
Replying and Forwarding to Messages
12:33
Hey everybody. Welcome back. I'm ready to show you how to reply and forward when you're working in your Gmail.
12:40
Very basic concepts when dealing with email, but you need to know where the buttons are. So the first thing I need to do is select the message that I
12:48
would like to reply or forward. So I'm gonna come in and just click on the message. It will open up.
12:53
Now, there are multiple ways to reply and forward. The first options are down here on the bottom you'll see a reply
13:00
button and a forward button. Now what's the difference? Reply means I wanna send this message back with an additional message to
13:06
the person that's sent it to me. There's also a reply button up in the top right where you see the person's
13:13
email address that the message came from. If you come to the right hand side, you'll see a reply button there as
13:18
well, and the reply button usually points to the left when you're facing your computer to indicate that you're sending the message back.
13:26
So let's start with a reply. When I click on a reply, what's interesting about Gmail is the
13:31
reply actually opens up at the bottom so I can see the previous message and then I can respond.
13:48
The other thing that we're seeing happen as I do this is some of the auto complete that's built into the Google platform.
13:53
When it's trying to assume what I'm gonna type, it can help save time. I need to finish my my reply by clicking on the send button.
14:00
Now another option, and I'm gonna go back to my inbox, is to forward a message.
14:06
When I forward a message, I will be sending it to another person. So what I need to do is open the message up, and again, I'll see
14:13
forward buttons down on the bottom. Or again, if I go up to the top of the message and go to the right of
14:20
the email sender's email address, I'll see a vertical ellipses. And if I click here, there's also a forward option here.
14:28
Notice forward usually has a right facing arrow when you're looking at your computer to indicate that the message will be sent to another party.
14:35
It's always important to remember when you're forwarding messages, you only want to forward content that other people should have access to.
14:42
It's sometimes it's easy to forward something that you shouldn't send to someone else.
14:52
And of course, always remember to click on the send button after you forward or reply, just so that the message actually gets sent.
15:00
All right, in the next lesson we're gonna look at how to manage and delete messages. So make sure you come back.
Deleting and Recovering Deleted Items
15:09
Hey everybody. I'm ready to manage some of the content in my inbox. Managing your content is important because as more Gmail comes into
15:17
your account, if you're not keeping it organized, it will take over. One of the important things to do is not to be afraid to delete
15:24
content when you no longer need it. There are a couple of options. One of them is if the message is open.
15:31
At the top of the message, you'll see a toolbar that includes buttons that allow you to, for example, archive the message or even put it in your spam folder.
15:41
But finally, the trash can. This means to move the message to your deleted items folder,
15:46
which is what I wanna do. I just click on the trash can and the message will be removed from my inbox.
15:52
Another option, before I even open a message up is if I see a message that I don't need to spend time on, I can place it directly in my deleted items folder.
16:02
All I need to do is select it on the left hand side by filling in this checkbox, and
16:07
then I can again come up here and click on the trash can, and that will also move the message into my deleted items folder.
16:14
Now, how do you get to those items if you've deleted them? Over here on the left hand side, again in the navigation pane,
16:21
I'm gonna come down to more. This allows me to expand the full menu out so that I can see the additional areas that are part of my inbox, and if I come down towards
16:30
the bottom, I will see the trash. Anything that you place in your deleted items, folder or trash as we
16:36
like to call it, will end up here. Now notice it tells me right here at the top that messages in the
16:43
trash will be here for 30 days and then they're automatically deleted. So don't use this as a fail.
16:49
Save for saving things you're not sure that you wanna get rid of. If it's here, you've got 30 days and then it will be gone.
16:56
If I see something here that I would like to put back in my inbox, I can come here and select it.
17:02
There are multiple options to do this, but one of them that I like is to right click on the message.
17:08
If you're on a pc, when you write click, you'll have an option that says Move to inbox.
17:14
This will take the message and move it to my inbox where it was before I deleted it.
17:20
To permanently delete something, you select the message, and then again, up here you'll have a delete forever.
17:26
This will overrule the 30 day retention policy that's normally in place for the trash can and permanently delete the message.
17:34
Just remember that cleaning up is important, and the more you keep track of the content here and spend a little bit of time each day curating
17:41
your Gmail, the less time you'll spend looking for things and wishing that you'd never created a Gmail account.
17:47
So it's an important habit to get into.
Printing and Finding Help
17:53
Hey everybody. I need to be able to print one of my Gmail messages and also get help.
17:59
So to start with, how do I print one of these messages? Well, first of all, I need to go to the message and click on it so that it's open.
18:06
Then I'm gonna go to the top right corner of the message, not my Gmail, but the message directly above the reply button.
18:14
I'll see a small printer. This is one of the options that will take me into a print preview
18:20
of the message that I have selected. Now, on the right, I'll see the options for how it's going to print, including
18:26
the ability to print different pages and even update the layout of the message.
18:32
Oh, Whether it prints in black or white. And then at the bottom I have my print button and this will print it off. Keep in mind, I can also actually save my message as a PDF from here.
18:41
This is a great way to get my message into a different format, either on paper or something that could be opened in a Adobe Acrobat, for example.
18:50
Now, what about getting help? And when I did go to the print, you'll notice that it opened my message in a separate browser tab.
18:56
All I need to do is come in and close that browser tab. It'll take me back to my inbox. Now, from anywhere in your inbox, there is an option to
19:04
access the help portion of Gmail. If you go to the top right hand corner next to the settings cog, you're gonna
19:11
see a circle with a question mark in it. This will take you to the Gmail support when you click on it, it's a
19:17
dropdown menu, and if you just want to go in and look up help within a small database, you can go to the help option.
19:24
This will actually take you into a little. Task pain. There are going to be popular resources for the help at the top,
19:32
and then down towards the middle, there's actually a search tool. So right here, if I type in the type of topic that I'm looking for,
19:40
like how do I preview my emails? When I click on this again, result that it brings back, it will take me in and show
19:47
me the different steps required to open up a reading pane, for example, so that I can preview my incoming email when I'm done.
19:54
All I need to do to close the help task pane is just click on it and it will close again. The more you use it, the easier it gets.
20:02
There's also nothing wrong with going into Google and just googling the question that you have, but just remember, be careful about what sites you go to.
20:11
If you're using the Built-in search tool, you'll know that you're always getting good Google based information back.
New Message Options and Formatting
20:20
Hi everyone. In this lesson I wanna do two things. I wanna format a new message in my Gmail.
20:26
I also wanna look at some of the settings I can control with new Gmail messages.
20:31
So I'm gonna come over and go to the compose button. You'll notice that my navigation toolbar was minimized, but when I
20:36
hover over compose, it opens up. This will take me to a new message. Now, an interesting thing about the new message box is when
20:44
it opens, it's quite small. We've already talked about the minimize full screen and close buttons, but
20:51
full screen gives you a lot more room to see this new message box. At the bottom of the new message box, you're gonna see two important items.
20:59
One of them is the formatting toolbar that we'll talk about in just a minute. The second one is on the bottom, and this contains the send button and
21:07
other important options, including the capital letter A, that allows you to open and close that formatting toolbar.
21:15
Now, on the far right hand side of this toolbar is a vertical ellipses,
21:20
and if you haven't figured this out yet, in most applications, the ellipses button now represents an opportunity for more options.
21:29
A couple of important things you'll see in this menu include a spell check, another option for printing a new message, and at the very top, You can
21:38
set up so that new messages will always default to open in this full screen view.
21:44
Once you left, click on that default to full screen. You'll see a check mark next to it, and it means the next time I
21:50
come in and open up a new message, it always defaults to full screen. I like this because it gives me more room to type.
21:58
Now I'm gonna go ahead and enter the name of the person I'm sending my email message to. Another nice thing that, again, Gmail's good at is remembering email
22:07
addresses that you've already put in so you don't have to type them in. Again, if you need to do a cc, remember that's on the right
22:14
hand side for carbon copy. And then of course, always remember your subject lines.
22:19
Right. Now if I type this in, I'm gonna do a little bit of formatting.
22:29
I wanna include some formatting and a bullet to the list.
22:36
Now for that, I'm gonna come down, make sure that my formatting toolbar is open.
22:41
We'll see in the middle right that there is a bullet to the list.
22:51
And of course, this is going to allow me to just type in my bullets one at a time. You do this just like you would in Microsoft Word or
22:58
PowerPoint or Google Docs.
23:18
Now the other thing I want to do is add a little bit of formatting. So for this, I'm gonna go ahead and highlight my text.
23:26
Come down. You'll see that on the formatting toolbar I have bold button. If I really want to make something poke out, I can always
23:33
highlight it and then come down. For color, I have a letter A with a line under it.
23:38
This does two things. It allows me to do text color, or I could also do background color.
23:44
Background color is gonna be like a highlight behind the text. It can take a little bit of time for it to apply, but again, you
23:51
can see how it's like a highlighter that I've applied behind. If I see any spell check issues, you'll see it get underlined.
23:58
I can right click and get again, a spell check correction. So formatting is really easy to use.
24:03
If you'd like to update with, for example, a different font style, you'll see next to the undo button and redo button.
24:10
You do have a few font choices. It's a little bit more limited, but also you can increase font sizes as well.
24:17
So there are some opportunities to update formatting to make your email message look a little bit more exciting.
24:23
Then I'm gonna send it off. Try this out in your own email account. Go in, open up a new email message.
24:29
You can even send it to yourself, but practice using some of those formatting options just so you can see how they compare with maybe
24:37
other applications that you've used. Hi everybody. Welcome back.
Sending Attachments
24:42
I'm ready to send message with a file. So I'm gonna come up, open up my new message, of course, address it
24:50
and include a subject line and then the actual text of the message.
25:00
Now the important thing when you send an attachment is to be sure you know where the attachment is stored.
25:06
This attachment is stored locally on my computer's hard drive, so I'm gonna come down to the bottom of my new Gmail message right next to the send button.
25:14
I'll see a paperclip. Now, most email applications that we use represent attach files with the
25:21
paperclip, so it's pretty easy to locate. When I click on it. I'm going to navigate to where the file is located on my computer or on a network
25:29
drive, select it and then click on open. It will copy the attachment into my Gmail message.
25:37
You can see it added down here at the bottom. Now remember that when you send an attachment, you are giving
25:42
someone access to a file. A copy of that file will be sent to the recipient of this email.
25:48
So it's always important to only send email attachments and information that that person has permission to access because they'll now have a
25:56
copy of this file that I'm sending. I'd love to have you try this out. So open up your own Gmail and send a message to someone with an attachment,
26:05
and then make sure it's someone trust and how easy it send attachments.
26:14
Hi everybody. We are ready to send a link through Gmail. This is another great way to communicate information that may be
Sending Links
26:20
outside your Gmail, like a document that's linked or also a website.
26:25
I'm gonna go up and compose my new message and again, address it to the person I'm sending it to include a subject line.
26:34
Now, one thing that I've done ahead of time that can be helpful is I've already gone in and opened up the website that I wanna create the link to.
26:42
You can see it right here. It's actually the Gmail help website, but I want to include
26:47
it in a message to a coworker. I have my text right here. Now to include the actual link to the site, I'm gonna come down to the bottom
26:56
of my new message and come over to about the fourth button over from the left, which is the insert link button.
27:04
Notice it looks a little bit different than the paperclip that you use to attach files because here we're going to be including a link to a site or
27:12
a file, not an actual attachment. I'm gonna click on the button and you'll see that it opens
27:18
up this box called edit link. Now I have two options. I can either link to an A website address.
27:24
This would be a u RL or an email. In this case, I want to go to a url, but I need to include texts.
27:31
That will actually be the link, so I'm gonna go ahead and just type that in. And then right here, I need to paste in the website address.
27:40
So if you already have the browser tab open for the website you want to go to, you can actually open it up, go to the URL bar, click on it
27:49
to highlight, or you could left drag and control C, or if you're on an
27:54
Apple computer command C, right? To copy that. Then I'm gonna jump back to my Gmail tab and I will come down and
28:02
control V or paste that link in. Then I'll click on, okay, and I'll see it right here.
28:11
Now, how does this link actually work? When you come to the link, you'll notice that until you send the message,
28:16
you can't actually use the link, but if you right click on it, there will be an option that you can use that will say, open this link in a new tab.
28:24
This would allow you to just check the link to see that it's working. And here I can see that it's opened, so it is working correctly, and
28:31
I'm gonna send the message off. So anyone who receives that message will get a hyperlink that they can click on,
28:39
that will then take them to that site. It's a great way to share information quickly and easily, and it doesn't require
28:46
you to put the entire website address in. You provide them with that hypertext link that will actually do it for them.
28:53
Go ahead and try it out. Pick your favorite website and try linking it and even emailing it or
28:59
gmailing it to yourself or to a coworker. It's a great way to share information through.
29:06
Hi everyone. I'm ready to attach a file to a Gmail message that's stored in my Google Drive account.
Inserting Files from Google Drive
29:13
This is one of the things I love about Gmail is that it comes with additional tools that really help to optimize your experience when you're
29:20
trying to communicate through Gmail. And one of them is that you can actually add files as attachments that are
29:26
stored in your Google Drive, which, if you remember, is cloud storage. Now, to do this, of course, we need open up another new message.
29:34
I'm going to address it, the person
29:41
now
29:49
down below, when I get ready to find the file, remember it's saved to my Google Drive.
29:55
So rather than going to the attachment button, I'm gonna come to the middle of the toolbar, next to the button and look for this triangle button.
30:04
When I hover over it, you'll notice that it tells me insert files using drive, which they mean Google Drive.
30:11
This is cloud storage. When I click on it, it's going to show me the different files that are stored on my drive.
30:18
You'll also see other options like files that have been shared with me by a coworker or someone else, recent files, or an opportunity to upload files.
30:28
In this case, the file I want is right here in my drive. I will select it. Now I have to make a choice.
30:34
This time I want to include it as a normal attachment, which means I select attachment, notice the paperclip, and then say, insert it, inserts it into
30:44
the message as a normal attachment, so it's being copied in the message.
30:49
Another option, I'm gonna go down to my insert using Google Drive again, is to select a file and actually add it as a linked file.
30:59
This means that I will be giving this person not a copy of my file, but an actual link, and I'll see the link right here at the top of the document.
31:18
So again, notice that the link file looks like a hyperlink, whereas the attachment looks like a traditional attachment, but they're both coming
31:27
from my Google Drive and Gmail gives me the opportunity to choose how. I will, again, share these files as an attachment or as a shared link.
31:36
When I'm done, I'm gonna click on send and it'll send that file off. Now you'll notice because I included the file as a link, it's
31:44
gonna ask me who gets access. Now at this point, anyone with this link would have the ability to view this file,
31:51
and that's fine, or I could not give access, and I'm gonna click on send.
31:56
So when you share the file with a link, the permission to access the file is an additional feature that you have to consider.
32:02
Now. Go in and try sharing a file from your Google Drive or attaching it.
32:08
It's a great way again, to make Gmail even more optimized.
Inserting Images into Messages
32:16
Hi everybody. I wanna be able to put an image in the actual text of my Gmail here.
32:22
Address, message, open ahead and type.
32:33
Now I want these images to actually appear within the body of my.
32:48
This is different than attaching them because if they're an attachment, then the attachment comes with the email.
32:53
You double click on it and it'll open in a photo viewing program, this will actually put the pictures in the body of the email.
33:00
So what I'm gonna do is come down to the bottom and actually look for the little image button that has mountains on it.
33:06
It's kinda small, but it's there. If you look for it, I'm gonna click on it. This is the insert photo button.
33:13
Now I can either have photos stored in my Google Drive or I can come to a website,
33:18
or if they're right here on my computer, I can select the files from my device. So I just need to highlight the pictures that I want to bring in.
33:26
Now it has to upload the pictures and actually add them to my new message. You can see them get added here.
33:33
They come in full size, and sometimes this means that they will be too big.
33:38
If I click on the image, you'll notice that there are sizing handles on the corners. Additionally, at the bottom, it gives me options to either change the size of the
33:48
image or even come in and add alternate texts for someone who might be visually impaired or even remove the image.
33:55
I can use these to help size the image better to fit into my email, or if I want to, I can manually click on the image at the corner and drag
34:04
it down and adjust it size manually. But this actually puts the image into the message.
34:10
Now remember that when you add images to your message, it will greatly increase their size, so it might be a good idea to make them smaller, just
34:19
so that your message isn't too vague. When I'm ready, I can send the message off and again, the person that receives
34:25
that Gmail message will be able to open it up and see those images inside of it. In fact, if I go to my sent items folder, I come right here
34:34
to the message I just sent. Double click on it and we'll see that the two messages are viewable right
34:39
within the actual content of the Gmail. It's a great way to quickly share something that's a
34:44
visual image that you want now. Try yourself a picture you've taken and message.
Sending Messages with Confidential Mode
34:57
Hi everybody. I'm concerned sometimes that when I send email messages or Gmail
35:02
messages, I'm not sure what happens to them after they get sent. We wanna talk about a thing called confidentiality mode.
35:10
In Gmail, you can send messages and attachments and turn on Gmail's confidentiality mode to help protect sensitive information
35:18
from unauthorized access. When you use confidential mode, basically what you can do is set
35:23
an expiration date for messages and revoke access at any time. Recipients of this confidential message will have options to
35:31
forward, copy, print, and download. Turned off. Now, how do you do this? Because it sounds pretty magic, doesn't it?
35:37
You're gonna come to the message. I have a new message here opened up that includes information that I want be confidential.
35:44
I don't want this content to be able to be forwarded to someone else. So on the bottom of the message, I'm gonna come down to the right hand side and
35:51
look for the padlock with a clock on it. This allows me to toggle on my confidential mode.
35:59
When I click on this, the confidential mode box opens up. You'll see things here that it will allow me to set an
36:04
expiration date on this message. Additionally, I can decide whether I'm going to include passwords and
36:12
if there is no SMS password or if there is an SMS passcode included.
36:18
Now, if I choose no SMS passcode recipients of this Gmail, I should say recipients using the Gmail app, will be able to open it directly.
36:27
If they don't have a Gmail, they will get an emailed passcode. If I choose to do an SMS passcode, recipients will get
36:35
a passcode by text message. We need to make sure that we enter the recipient's phone number, not your own.
36:41
If you do this, I'm gonna go ahead and just say, no SMS passcode, and click on save.
36:47
Now you'll see here this again little alarm comes up notification letting me know that whoever I've sent this message to will not be able to
36:54
forward copy, print or download the email, which is exactly what I want. Notice that the confidential mode button is highlighted and I'll click on send.
37:04
Again, this helps me to send messages with a piece of mind, knowing that the message
37:09
will stay confidential just between myself and the person I sent, and in this case, it expire after sending message
37:21
it. Hi everyone. I want to send a signature with my new Gmail messages.
Creating Email Signatures
37:30
For this, I need to access the settings gear of my Gmail account. So I'm going to go to the top right hand corner.
37:37
This will take me to the settings task pane. I need to go down to see all settings, especially when
37:43
you're using Gmail for work. It's important to include contact information, like cell phone numbers,
37:49
job titles, ways to get ahold of you that people can see in your messages. This is why signatures can be so crucial.
37:56
Now, from here, you're gonna see tabs at the top. You should be on the general tab, and then scroll down for quite
38:02
a while, almost to the bottom. On the left hand side, you'll see signatures.
38:09
Click Create new button. Give my new signature a name, and yes, you can have multiple
38:14
signatures in your Gmail account. Then in the box on the right, I'm going to paste in or type
38:20
in my signature information. This can include my name, my email address.
38:25
Now, if I would like to include formatting, I need to use the toolbar underneath to update, for example, the font style and the font size.
38:34
I can also include color if I want to apply text color. I'll come to the letter a button, find the text color that I want, and for
38:42
anything like bold or italics, I just again, need to use the formatting toolbar.
38:47
When I'm finished, I also need to make sure that I apply this new signature for new emails and replies and forwards the very bottom.
38:56
I'm going to save my changes. This is very critical because if you close that box without doing
39:02
the save changes, your new signature will not be available to you. Now to see the signature, I'm gonna compose a new message.
39:09
I'm going to address it and notice my new signature is here and it includes
39:14
the formatting that selected for. Now, let's say that I decide I don't wanna include this particular signature,
39:21
or I'd like to include a different one on the body of the new message. I'll see a toolbar that includes a pen.
39:28
This is the insert signature button. If I click on this, it would let me turn off the signature.
39:34
Or if I had additional signatures, they would show up in this list and I could pick them. When I'm ready, I'll send the message off and I set up my default so that
39:42
if I go in to forward a message or reply to a message, you'll notice
39:48
here that when I go in to do that,
39:54
it would still include my signature at the very bottom of whatever information I'm sending.
39:59
So again, signatures are a great way to really customize your experience and make sure that the people that you're sending messages to have a way to contact you.
40:08
Go into your own Gmail account and try setting up a signature of your own.
Spell Check and Spelling Options
40:15
Welcome back. It's time to talk about spell check. It's the thing we don't want to think about, but when it goes wrong, it's bad.
40:23
So I want to show you, first of all where your spell check settings in your Gmail account are located.
40:28
I'm gonna come up and go to the settings cog and click on it and of course open up.
40:34
See all settings. This way you can go into the in depth settings under the general tab.
40:40
I'm gonna scroll down about halfway and I'll see that there are kind of three important areas.
40:45
The first one is grammar. This is where it suggests good grammar in your Gmail, spelling
40:52
suggestions, and then auto correct. This is where if you make a common spelling error, it will
40:58
automatically fix it for you. If any of these bug you, you can turn them off.
41:03
But I like these settings. I'm gonna keep them exactly the way they are cuz I'm not changing anything.
41:08
I'm just gonna click on the inbox button and go back. Let's see, for example, that I am responding to a message.
41:15
Open the message up, come down and click on a reply. And then I'll of course get my text into the message.
41:22
Now, one place where you'll see spell check is when you make a spelling error, like you see the one here, which is on purpose by the way.
41:29
You can right click on it and you'll see spelling suggestions. If there's one that you want, you can click on it and it will fix it.
41:37
Another one that's really common is where you of course, will ask for a spelling
41:43
correction by doing a spell check. And for that you can turn on spell check yourself.
41:51
I'm gonna come down here to, again, the bottom of the message. Click on the vertical ellipses and go into check spelling.
41:59
This initiates a spell check. You can see here how it's highlighted. The word that I've misspelled.
42:04
I can right click on it and pick the correct spelling. Additionally, if I want to recheck, if I don't trust the spell check,
42:12
I can click right here and notice that next to the recheck button. On the bottom right hand corner of the message, you do have an arrow that
42:19
allows you to actually decide what language the spell check is being done. So English is not the only language that's supported by Gmail.
42:28
When I'm done, I can just click on the send button and my message has been spell checked and sent off.
42:34
So try it out in one of your messages just so you can feel solid with doing spell check, because it is important and we wanna make sure that our Gmail makes
42:42
us look smart and not the other option.
Vacation Responder
42:47
Howdy everybody. Let's set up an out of office reply or what's called a vacation responder
42:53
in Gmail, so that when we do get to go on vacation, our Gmail is going to be partially curated for us.
43:00
While we're gone, I'm going to come up to the settings cog in the top right hand corner and go into my defaults for my Gmail account.
43:08
We'll go down to see settings, and from this box, you wanna make sure that you're under the general tab and all the way at the bottom.
43:17
Now, of course, by default, the vacation responder is turned off. To turn it on, you need to place a dot and then include the date when
43:25
you want your vacation to begin. If you want to include a last day, you can do that using the calendar
43:32
or typing the date in Also a subject line, because this is going to be an email response to incoming messages.
43:40
Then down below, you can actually include the text of the message. Notice there's a toolbar here that you can use to have it formatted.
43:48
Now, it's important to understand how this works. It's gonna send an automatic reply when someone sends you a message.
43:55
If you have someone that sends you many messages, they're only gonna get one automatic reply every four days because we don't want them to get
44:02
that same reply over and over again. Also, this checkbox at the very bottom, would only send the response
44:10
to someone who's in your contacts. Sometimes we have a lot of junk mail that comes into our Gmail account, so
44:16
this would keep it from sending them a vacation response when I'm not around. It's also important to know that your vacation replies will start at 12:00
44:24
AM on the first day that you enter in here and end at 11:59 PM at the end
44:31
date, unless you wanna end it earlier. In most cases, your vacation response is only sent to people the first time
44:37
they message you, because as we already mentioned, it starts over every four days. Now, a couple of things also to keep in mind with this is that if you edit your
44:47
vacation response, it will send another one when someone emails you again.
44:52
So there is a chance they could get two if you set up the initial response and then do another one.
44:58
Now, when I'm done setting up my vacation response, it's important that I click on Save changes and again, notice that it will set up to end on whatever day I pick.
45:09
And then I'll know that it's turned on. And while I'm gone, I can know that people will know that I won't be
45:15
answering these messages immediately. So it's an important thing to do. It's also considered polite and it will save you a lot of time having to answer
45:23
emails that you didn't have time to deal with because you are on vacation. So try it out just so you can see where it is and be familiar with it.
45:30
And that way when you need to use it, you'll.
45:35
Hey everybody. One of my pet peeves about email is when I have to create the same email over and over again.
Creating Templates
45:42
There is a way around this in Gmail and it's called Creating a Template.
45:47
The template basically becomes a copy of that email message that you can reuse whenever you need to send it.
45:54
The first thing we need to do is turn templates on in our Gmail account. So we're gonna go up to the settings Cog in the top right hand corner.
46:02
You should be getting really good at that by now. Click on it and go to see all settings.
46:08
Now, this time we are going to go to a different tab. At the top of the settings box, you'll see that there are several different tabs.
46:16
Go over to the right, almost to the end and find advanced. Once you're here, you will see that down towards the middle there is a
46:25
template section in new Gmail accounts. It's turned off or disabled.
46:30
As you can see, we're going to enable this so that we can start creating template emails and we'll say save changes.
46:38
Now, once you're done doing that, you need to create one of the emails that you want to create into a template before the template can be made.
46:46
So I'm gonna go up to the compose button and open up my message and just get it ready.
46:57
The person I send it to is not as important as the text and the subject line.
47:03
And of course my signature's included because I have signatures turned on. Now, to make this email into a template, I'm going to come down to the bottom
47:11
and go to the vertical ellipses. More options. I'll now see a new opportunity here called templates, and what I want
47:20
to do is come into this menu and say, save draft as a new template.
47:27
I need to give my new template a name. It will default to give it the name of the subject line, which works great for me.
47:34
And I'll click on save. Now I can go ahead and send this message off. Another month goes by and it's time to recreate that same email.
47:43
I'm gonna go up to the pose button, but before I type anything in, I'm going to come down to the bottom of the new email message and go to the More options button.
47:54
Templates will be here. Any templates that you've created will show up under the insert template menu.
48:01
There's also a way to delete any templates you no longer need. I'm gonna select the template that I want.
48:08
It fills it out, but it does not include the recipients of the message. This is where I will need to type in the names of the people that
48:15
I need to send this message to. Once I do that, I can send it off.
48:20
The thing about templates is they'll save a lot of time and create consistencies in those redundant emails that you need to send every month or every
48:28
week, especially around work topics. So feel free to go in and try these out because they can be a big time saver.
Applying Labels
48:38
Welcome back everybody. I'm ready to show you a really great tool to help you organize your Gmail. It's called a label.
48:45
Now, in other email programs, you might have stored email in folders, but in Gmail you can use labels to categorize.
48:51
Your email. Labels are like folders, but they have a twist. You can apply several labels to an email.
48:57
Then later you can find it by clicking on any of its labels over in the navigation pane. You can also search by labels.
49:03
The great thing about these is that you are the one that's in control of them. So first of all, how do you apply a label to any of your messages?
49:11
I'm gonna come over here and just. Select the message. When I do this, I'll see above my inbox list a new toolbar populate.
49:20
On the far right hand side, I'm gonna see a white little ticket button. This is the label button.
49:26
When you click on it, you're gonna see that you can search for labels. There are also some prebuilt labels that are provided by Google, but down
49:33
at the bottom you can create a new label, which is what I'm gonna do. So I'm gonna select create new.
49:39
I'm gonna create some labels for projects that I work on. I type in the name and click on Create.
49:45
Now the label has been applied. I didn't get to pick the color or anything, but we can see in my inbox
49:51
how it's showing up right next to the name of the particular message. Now, let's say that I'd like to customize that label.
49:59
I have a few different options. If I come back up to the labels menu, I'll see that I can go down and manage labels.
50:06
This will actually take me into my settings list. So again, this is the settings that I can also access from the
50:12
cog in the top right hand corner. This will show me my current, again, availability of labels and any custom
50:19
labels show up down at the bottom. Now, to leave this menu, I'm just gonna click on my inbox again.
50:24
Another easier way to work with labels is to actually come over to the navigation pane.
50:30
Right under the more button, you'll see a label section with a plus sign next to the word labels.
50:36
If I click on this, this will automatically bring up the new label box, and from here I can just type in the name of the label I want, and
50:44
it will add it to my labels menu. Now, to customize any of these pre-built labels or labels that I've created,
50:51
I'm gonna come to the label, hover over it, and go to the ellipses. This will let me adjust the color of the label.
50:58
And you can add custom colors. By the way, if you look here, you'll see that there's an add custom color option.
51:05
A couple of other options that you're gonna see here, besides being able to actually customize the color of the label is you can also decide if the label will
51:14
show over here in this label's menu. If it's gonna show up in the message list. This is your inbox, or if you'd like to edit or remove the label.
51:23
Now, if you remove the label, this is like deleting it. Let's go ahead and set the label color on this message as well.
51:30
So now I have my M 800 and my M 900. And now if I want to apply the label to more than one message, I'm gonna
51:37
select multiple messages, come up to the labels button, click on it,
51:42
and I can just check off the label. I want to apply, and I'll notice that it gets applied to multiple messages.
51:48
So go into your Gmail and try creating some labels of your own.
Editing and Removing Labels
51:56
Hi everyone. Welcome back. We wanna spend a little bit more time managing labels and applying
52:01
them to our Gmail messages. Now in my inbox right now, I have three custom labels that I have created.
52:08
Also, look at the second message in my inbox, and you'll see that you can actually apply as many labels to a specific Gmail message as you'd like.
52:17
A really great way to do this on a PC is to go to the message that you'd like to apply the label to.
52:23
Right click on it, and fourth, from the bottom you'll see a label as option.
52:29
This is a great way to go because it actually shows you the labels you currently have created.
52:35
You can check off the labels that you'd like to apply. Make sure you click on the apply button at the bottom.
52:42
Checking the box off will not actually apply the label until you click on apply.
52:47
Now, if any of these labels get edited, it will edit them on all the conversations
52:52
or Gmail emails they've been applied to. For example, I'm gonna come to my M 700 label.
52:58
I'm gonna go up to the ellipses next to it and update its label color. When I do this notice, it's updated everywhere where it's been used.
53:06
Another great thing about the labels is that if you want to use them to filter the email in your inbox, The labels are one of the fastest ways to do it.
53:16
If I come over here and click on any of the labels, it actually filters for just the messages that have that label applied to them.
53:24
So it's a great way for me to be able to find specific messages without having to put them in folders.
53:29
If I want to go to an unfiltered list, I can either come up to the search bar and click on the X next to the showing filter, or I can come over
53:37
and just click on my inbox again, and it will turn the filter off. Now finally, what if I delete one of these labels?
53:44
Will it delete the emails or the Gmails associated with that label? I'm gonna come to my M 800 label, go to the ellipses and
53:53
come down and say, remove label. This is the same as deleting it. When I remove a label, it will tell me it's removing it from two conversations.
54:02
That would be, again, two items in my inbox and the label will be deleted. But deleting a label will never actually delete the Gmail messages
54:10
associated with that label. So again, labels are an excellent way to filter for content and allow you
54:16
to categorize your Gmail content with categories that are your very own. So try out making some of your own labels and then organizing your Gmail with them.
Applying Stars and Important Markers
54:30
Hi everyone. We need to talk about two important markers in your navigation pain that cause a lot of confusion.
54:37
If you look over here in my Google account, you'll see that I have a starred option, and then there's also one called important.
54:45
Then I'm gonna show you how to turn on in just a moment. Now, why are these both here? Because when I see a star, it makes me think I need to pay attention to it.
54:53
The star marker is an alternative method for you to basically mark messages as being important to you.
55:00
You can flag them yourself. Now, important is different because it is actually designed by Gmail
55:08
to mark is important for you. It's something that's automatically done and it is a label.
55:14
Gmail uses an algorithm and watches what you do. Now, you can also manually mark messages as important, but Gmail learns
55:21
as it goes with the important label. Now, if I don't see both in this list, how can I turn them both on?
55:27
We're gonna come right here to the navigation pane, make sure it's all the way open and go down to more.
55:34
When I come down, I'll see that important is here. If for some reason it isn't, go down to where you see
55:40
managed labels under the trash. And come into the settings area and the labels tab.
55:47
What you wanna do is make sure that anything you want to be able to see clearly is basically marked as show, which means it will show up in the
55:56
menu over here, and all you need to do when you're done making those changes, it's just click back on the inbox and it will show your email again.
56:04
Now I see starred and I see important now to apply, for example, a starred email, which is meaning I am manually marking it as important.
56:13
All I need to do is come over here and I'll see a star next to the select message option.
56:19
I click on this and it fills it in. Now remember that with important, it will automatically apply that, but if
56:26
it doesn't, if a message is important to me and Gmail has skipped it, I can actually come right here to this little icon that's to the right hand side of the
56:35
star, and this will mark it as important. And notice that when it has an important or a starred status, you'll actually see
56:42
the marker fill in with a different color. Now, what's the use of this? Let's say later on I need to see all of my starred marker emails.
56:51
I'm gonna come right here to Stard and click on it in the navigation pane. Any messages that have the star applied to them will be filtered.
56:59
Also, notice up in my search bar it will say is colon stard. Now if I wanna see any of the important messages that either I
57:08
or Gmail have marked for me, I can come down and click on important. But remember, with the important status, this is something that Gmail
57:16
will actually do for you automatically. Now, to turn one of those settings off, I'm gonna return back to my inbox list.
57:23
All I have to do to unstar something is just click on the star and all I have to do to un important something is click on it and it will remove
57:30
that option from the message. But these two markers are available for you to use as you want inside of Gmail,
57:38
and don't be afraid to try them out because they're really easy to apply.
Scheduling Messages
57:46
Hi. I need to make sure that before this message is sent, I can schedule when it will actually be sent.
57:52
Cause by default, as soon as I click on the send button at the bottom of this new message, it's going to go out to that person that it's addressed to.
58:00
What I'm going to do to schedule the send is come to the arrow next to the send button.
58:05
This is magic. When you click on it, it will allow you to schedule when the message will actually be sent out.
58:11
I'm gonna schedule this message to actually be sent on Monday morning Notice. I could also actually come in and pick a date and time that I want just by typing
58:20
it into the box and saying, schedule send. Now, how can I see messages that have been scheduled after I've been set them up?
58:28
After I've set them up over in the navigation pane, make sure it's all the way expanded.
58:34
There is a section for scheduled messages. When you click on this, it will show you any of your messages that are scheduled
58:42
to be sent out at a specific time. Not only that, it will show you the time of day or the date when they're scheduled.
58:48
Now, if you actually come in and click on the message, it will open it up and notice that you have the opportunity to cancel having that message sent at that time.
58:58
It doesn't actually delete the message though. It opens it back up and allows you to come back down and reschedule
59:05
when you want the message to be sent. And so I'm gonna go ahead and just say, Hey, let's send it tomorrow.
59:10
And as long as the messages stay in this menu, they will be sent out at their established date and time, and you don't have to worry about them.
59:17
It's really great because it gives you more control over when something is actually received by the person you're sending it to.
59:24
Go into your own email and try it out.
Snoozing Messages
59:29
Hi, have you ever had a really long week and you get that email that you just don't wanna deal with?
59:35
Well, first of all, I'm gonna open that email up. Here's the email. Notice it has a couple of attachments in it.
59:41
Remember, with attachments, you can easily come underneath and download. Or even have those attachments added to your Google Drive account, or you can even
59:50
go in and edit them using Google Slides. You can see that this will depend on the type of file. This is a PowerPoint, so that's why I get the edit with Google Slides.
59:58
But even if I just want to preview the particular attachment, I can click on it and it will preview for me so I can look at it, and then if I click on the back
1:00:06
arrow, it takes me back to the message. Now, I definitely know I can't deal with this right now, so I want to
1:00:12
use this snooze feature in Gmail. What I'm gonna do is come to the top of the message where I see, again,
1:00:18
the toolbar for managing the message, and I'm gonna come into the middle. It's where I see the clock.
1:00:24
This is the snooze button. It takes this message and allows me to either pick a specific date
1:00:29
and time when I want to deal with this message, or I can pick one. I'm just gonna go ahead and say later today, and notice that I can
1:00:36
do this with multiple messages. Another option for snoozing is to right click on the message and you'll see
1:00:42
a snooze option in the menu as well. And again, I can pick either a specific date and time, like I can
1:00:49
say Monday, I wanna deal with this. Now, after a message has been snoozed, where can you go
1:00:54
to see your snoozed content? Over in the ma in the navigation pane, you'll see that same clock.
1:01:02
And when you click on it, you'll see any messages that you've snoozed. You'll also see the date and time when they've been marked to be,
1:01:10
again, put back into your inbox so that you pay attention to them. If you ever want to edit this, you can actually just go to the date and time
1:01:17
that's shown and the snooze button, and you can come in and say, UN snooze. It will remove the message from your snooze box and
1:01:25
put it back into your inbox. So snooze messages are a way to let something take a nap or snooze so
1:01:32
that you don't have to deal with it. Try this out. It's a great way to sometimes delay stress.
Search and Advanced Search
1:01:42
Hey everybody. There's nothing worse than not being able to find a message that you need to in
1:01:47
your Gmail box, so it's great to remember that the search mail at the top is a very
1:01:53
powerful tool for searching and filtering. Let's start with just a simple keyword search.
1:01:58
I can click here, type in the name of the person that I want to find all content from.
1:02:03
Now notice as I do this, it actually instinctually gives me option. Does the message have an attachment?
1:02:10
Was it sent in the last seven days? Was it from me? I'm gonna go ahead and say, has attachment, and then I'm going to
1:02:17
hit the enter key on my computer. This will go through and find any messages that included Diego.
1:02:22
Notice how his name is also included and have attachments. Remember, it's both.
1:02:28
To clear the search, I'm gonna click on the X. Now, if you really want a powerful way to make sure your searches are
1:02:34
successful, before you type in your keywords, come to the right hand side and look at search options.
1:02:41
These allow you to specify if it's a specific message from a person, and as I type in a person's name, it will actually select them from my contacts if
1:02:50
there's a specific two or subject line. If it has a specific size, a specific date, and when I'm ready, I can click on
1:02:58
search and notice it found exactly the message that I was looking for, and now I can double click on it and open it up.
1:03:04
Now you can also use key words when you perform a search. So if I come in here and I type the word from and then a colon, I can
1:03:12
actually say who the message was from. And I'll say, for example, Megan in this case. And notice that even selects her name and I can say has an attachment.
1:03:22
And then I can hit the enter key to perform the search. And again, it's found the message that I'm looking for.
1:03:28
If I need to refine my search even more, there's an advanced search option that takes me back to the pain where I could go ahead and actually
1:03:35
add more detail to the search. And again, when I'm done, I'm just gonna click on the X and go back to my inbox to clear the search out.
1:03:42
Search, try searching on your own. Because what I find is the more you do searches, the more comfortable you're going to get with how Gmail goes about them.
Saving Filters
1:03:53
Hi everyone. Now we need to talk about filtering and sorting your inbox.
1:03:59
Now to start with filters we've already used, we applied labels previously in the course.
1:04:05
And remember, once a label has been applied to a message, you can come to the navigation pane, click on the label, and the label will filter your inbox
1:04:14
by the messages it's been applied to. We also explored some of the built-in labels that service filters that
1:04:21
are part of the Gmail platform, the stard label that you can apply. The Snoozed label, the important label and the scheduled label.
1:04:31
These are all built-in labels that you can apply to messages that allow you to understand different things about them.
1:04:38
But what if you want a filter that will be saved and do something for you? In this case, we're going to go up to the search bar and to the right
1:04:46
hand side to the search options or the advanced search options. From here, I'm going to type in the criteria.
1:04:53
Anytime a message comes from a specific person, I want to create a filter that I can use.
1:05:01
I'm going to click on Create Filter, but this filter will actually do something for me what I'd like it to do, and notice some of the different options.
1:05:10
I can archive the message, automatically star it or apply a label, and
1:05:17
then I'll click on Create Filter. So whenever a message matches that criteria, so in this case a message
1:05:25
from that person, then I would like that particular filter and in this case, rule to be applied to it.
1:05:32
Now, how do I edit or get rid of those filters? I'm gonna need to go back to my Gmail settings, and this time I'm actually going
1:05:40
to come to all settings and go to the filters and blocked addresses tab in here.
1:05:47
Any filters that I have created for incoming messages will show up in this list.
1:05:52
I can check off and notice there's an edit option. That would take me back in to edit the filter, or there's also going to be,
1:06:00
when I'm in there, I'm gonna go back in really quick, an option to delete the
1:06:06
filter so that it will no longer run. So not only is this a filter, it's also something that will
1:06:12
perform a task for me in my inbox. So I also like to call these rules because they filter,
1:06:19
but they also apply something. In this case, it was a label that was being applied to that message.
1:06:25
Feel free to play with these, but remember, they can impact the content of your inbox, so use them carefully.
1:06:35
Hi. It's not uncommon to want to apply filter to messages that are already in your inbox.
Applying Filters
1:06:40
So what I'm gonna do is select the message and come up to the, again, toolbar at the top, and go to the more options or vertical ellipses button.
1:06:49
Here I'm gonna select filter messages like these. Now it already knows, this message is from, again, this particular coworker.
1:06:57
I could include additional criteria, but I'm gonna select Create Filter. And then again, I'm going to select what I want it to do.
1:07:06
Apply a label, delete the message, mark it as important, and then I'll click on Create Filter.
1:07:11
What I'll notice is that it will actually apply that, and again, that filter will be running in my inbox, and you can see down here it
1:07:18
even tells me I've created a filter. So you can go back into settings and edit those filters after you've created them.
Blocking Senders and Spam
1:07:29
Hi everybody. What about all those emails you get that you don't want? You have some options.
1:07:35
I'm gonna go back to my inbox. Let's say something that looks suspicious. You can actually block the message and report it as spam.
1:07:44
To do this, I'm going to open the message up. Remember, don't click on any attachments.
1:07:49
Come to the top of the message and I'll actually see a report spam button. Also, you don't even have to open the message up if you just
1:07:56
select it and come to the top. You'll see again, it looks like a little stop sign with an exclamation point in it.
1:08:03
This will add the message to your spam folder. Now, what Google does with spam is it will actually analyze the emails
1:08:10
and it goes through and makes sure that you don't get impacted by them. When you go to your spam folder, you'll see messages that
1:08:16
you've marked as spam there. Now, let's say that maybe it was an accident. You can select the message and either say Delete Forever or not spam.
1:08:24
This will remove it from your spam folder and put it back in your inbox. Another option is to make a message so that the person is blocked.
1:08:34
To do this, you're again going to open the message up and come to the top right hand corner. Next to the reply button, you'll see a vertical ellipses.
1:08:43
This will give you a list of options for dealing with this message, and one of them is to come down and say, if you look at this list, it actually gives
1:08:52
me an opportunity to block messages from this particular email account. Now, once the message has been blocked, you'll notice it tells me future messages
1:09:01
from this email will be marked as spam. So I'm gonna click on block. It shows me here.
1:09:06
Now I can either remove the message from spam or I will unblock the sender.
1:09:11
Unblock would mean that I would start getting messages from that email account, but it's really important to remember that you can get dangerous
1:09:19
content coming into your Google account. So being aware of suspicious messages and properly managing them is very important.
1:09:28
So protect yourself. Be smart. If something doesn't look right, don't open it. Put it in your spam folder or delete it, and don't be afraid to report it,
1:09:37
especially if you're using Gmail for work. Hi everyone.
Conclusion
1:09:43
Thank you so much for joining us on this part one of How to use Google's gmail.
1:09:48
We've spent time setting up a Gmail account. We've also looked at how easy it is to create new messages, add
1:09:55
attachments to those messages. And not only that, we've also explored being able to do settings
1:10:00
in our Google account to set it up the way we want it to run. We've also looked at being able to create labels and assign those labels to our
1:10:08
different Gmail messages, and then using those labels actually filter our inbox.
1:10:13
Not only that, we've also spent time looking at how to search and filter your Gmail account.
1:10:19
You're not ready to start sending Gmail, and please join us for the second portion of this course where we talk about how to use the chat and Google Meet features.
1:10:28
Also working with Google Contacts and your Google Calendar, so there's even more great content.
1:10:33
So come back and join us for that. Hello everybody. Welcome to our Google Gmail Fundamentals Part two course.
Introduction
1:10:42
My name's Elissa Smith, and in this course we're gonna go beyond the actual email part of Gmail.
1:10:48
Did you know that when you have a Google account you can do things like keep track of Google Contacts?
1:10:54
In this course, we're going to show you how you can also have a calendar associated with your Gmail account.
1:11:00
In this course, we're gonna look at how you can create, edit, and manage your Google Calendar. In addition to that, a Gmail account also comes with a chat feature.
1:11:08
You can even track tasks that are associated with your Google account, including notes.
1:11:14
So in this course, we're gonna look at how to knock the top off of just sending email through your Gmail account and look at all these other great components
1:11:21
that come with having a Google account and are easy to get to from Gmail.
Chat, Meet, and Spaces
1:11:28
Hi everyone. I want to introduce you to some really great features available through your Gmail account called Chat Meet and Spaces.
1:11:37
Now, why do these three additional features exist? It's because Gmail is not the always the most efficient way to communicate.
1:11:45
On average, email takes about eight business hours to get a response from. So when you need to connect with someone faster, that's where the Google Chat
1:11:54
meet and spaces features help you out. Now, first of all, in your Gmail account, you'll see over on the
1:12:00
left hand side in the navigation pane that if you click on more, you can access a chats area from there.
1:12:06
But what about the meet and also the additional feature of being able to have a Google space, you have to turn those areas on to do that.
1:12:16
We're setting in corner. And click on it. Now, there are two different ways to go about getting both the chat and
1:12:25
meet features available, and this will also activate the spaces area. If you come under the Quick Settings menu, you'll see that in apps in Gmail, there's
1:12:34
a chat and meet area At the very top. If you come in and select Customize, it just brings up a popup window
1:12:41
where you can check off both features. When you click on Done, you'll need to reload your Gmail app.
1:12:48
This will refresh, and you'll notice that on the left hand side of your navigation pane, you're now gonna have an additional task pain.
1:12:56
But again, it's something that you can expand and collapse. The other part of your Gmail navigation with this includes the Meet feature.
1:13:05
The spaces feature and the chat feature. Now, what exactly are these?
1:13:11
The chat feature is basically a place where you can chat with either people through Gmail or other people in your organization.
1:13:19
Then you have the spaces area. The spaces area is going to be a place where you can communicate
1:13:25
with one or more people. It's often used in an organization. It's a central place also, where people can share files, assign
1:13:32
tasks, and stay connected. Now the third area that you're going to see is the Google Meet
1:13:37
feature, and this is the ability to basically meet with someone online. So with a Google account, you can create video meetings, invite up
1:13:45
to a hundred participants, and meet up for 60 minutes per meeting at no cost using the Google Meet feature.
1:13:52
Now I wanna show you one more way that you can turn this on and off through your Gmail account.
1:13:58
I'm gonna come back up to the settings gear. When I click on settings, I'm gonna come to see all settings.
1:14:05
This will take me again into the settings that we explored a lot in the Gmail Fundamentals Part one.
1:14:11
So if you haven't taken that first hit, do it. But you'll see that at the top there are tabs and there's a chat and Meet area.
1:14:18
When I click on this, it allows me to go in and turn on the Google Chat and also the Google Meet.
1:14:25
Now when I do that, you'll see that over in the navigation pane, the spaces area is automatically part of that experience.
1:14:33
So it comes with it. And remember that these two areas, actually three areas, are not turned
1:14:38
on in your Gmail account by default. So you will need to come here into settings of which we showed you and
1:14:44
dot both Google Chat and Google Meet. And then make sure you click on Save Changes, go into your own Gmail
1:14:51
account and turn them on so you can explore with us in future lessons.
1:14:56
Hi everyone. I'd like to be able to get to the chat and spaces features of my Gmail account,
Navigating to Chats and Spaces
1:15:02
but not have to be in my Gmail inbox. While I do it for this, I can actually open up the chat portion of my Gmail
1:15:09
account separate from my inbox. A couple of different ways to do this. One of them is to go to the top right hand corner and use the waffle button.
1:15:18
Click on it and I will see that chat is actually one of. The many applications that come with a Google account.
1:15:25
When I click on this, it'll open up a new browser tab in whatever browser I'm using.
1:15:30
It'll say chat at the top and I'll see that the chat feature of my Google account will now be enabled.
1:15:36
Now, there aren't any chats in here yet, but that's because I haven't created any. As I start creating them, I'll see more.
1:15:43
Also, notice below in the navigation pane and area for spaces, these are those group or organizational conversations where I want to manage
1:15:51
additional content with my chats. Now, another way to do this same thing is to go up and add a new
1:15:57
browser tab, and then you're going to type in right there chat.google com.
1:16:03
Now, if you're already logged into your Gmail account, this will open up your chat area associated with your Google account and take you to the exact same place.
1:16:12
Either way, it's a great way to get in and again, be able to work with the chat and spaces features of a Google account without having to be part of your Gmail.
1:16:22
But remember from your Gmail, once you enable it, you can also get to chats and spaces just by coming over here to the far left hand side,
1:16:30
navigation and clicking on them. And this will actually take you to that area separate from your inbox, and it's
1:16:38
a lot faster than trying to open the new G, the new tabs in your Google account.
1:16:43
Now go into your own Google account and explore this, see what you prefer. In the next lesson, we're gonna look at how to actually create some chats.
Sending Chat
1:16:54
Hi everyone. I wanna be able to send my first chat from my Gmail account, so I do have the chat and meet features of my Gmail account enabled.
1:17:04
I'm gonna come over to the left hand side to the navigation pane and click on chat. This is a fantastic way to actually go from your inbox to your chats.
1:17:14
Now a couple things about sending a chat. To use Google Chat, the person that you're gonna be chatting with can
1:17:20
be outside your organization, but they need to have a Google account. So they need to be a Google Workspace user or have an account that ends with
1:17:28
Gmail or a non Gmail Google account. If the external account is a Google Workspace user, their administrator would
1:17:34
have to turn on Google Chat for their org. So there's a little bit of background work that has to be done for this
1:17:40
to work, but to send a new chat. Notice right here, there's a new chat button right below my Gmail icon, and
1:17:48
also right here in the very middle, of course, I'm going to need someone to chat with, and I actually have a recent coworker I've chatted with, and
1:17:56
I can select them from my recent list. Otherwise, I'd need to actually enter in either the space name or the person's
1:18:04
Gmail address right here at the top. I'm gonna click and it's going to take me in and show me any past
1:18:10
conversations I've had with this person. And then right here I can actually type in my message.
1:18:19
Now, this is not like email because this is like chatting on your cell phone. And by the way, there is a Google Chat app that you can
1:18:28
install on your mobile device. It works on both Android and Apple phones.
1:18:33
So I just type in my message and hit the send button, which is this little icon right here that looks kinda like a paper airplane.
1:18:41
Now my coworker or the person I'm chatting with will get that message and they can respond.
1:18:47
Now, another great thing about Google Chat is you can see them typing. I can actually see the person who's responding typing.
1:18:54
Now, the other great thing that you can do as well is respond instead with not, for example, text.
1:19:00
But notice here on the right that you can actually respond with emojis, GFIs, and other content.
1:19:06
I'm gonna use an emoticon, and sometimes an emoticon can say a lot more, for example, than words.
1:19:13
So we're having a chat conversation, and this is different than an email conversation.
1:19:19
And again, the way I got here was from the navigation pane of my Gmail account. Try sending a chat to someone that you work with or someone
1:19:27
that you know that has a Gmail account and play with this feature. Again, it's a very powerful way to have communication that's a
1:19:33
lot faster than an email message. Hi everyone.
Deleting Chat
1:19:39
The more you use Google Chats, you'll see that they are a really great way for quick
1:19:44
realtime communication, but sometimes they can overpower your Gmail and sometimes
1:19:51
you just need to get rid of them. So there are two options when it comes to turning off a chat or deleting it.
1:19:59
What I want, basically turn off a, I'm over into my. Chat pain, or I can see past chats.
1:20:06
When I come over to the right, I'll see a vertical ellipses. Now, if you've taken the part one, you're gonna know that these are the
1:20:13
more button of your Gmail account. When you click on this, you'll see different options to help you
1:20:18
manage your Gmail account, one of which is to hide the conversation. This will just remove it.
1:20:24
It's not deleting it, but removing it from your chat history. The other important thing to note before I do this is that
1:20:32
my chat history is turned on. This means that they'll be saved. If it's not turned on.
1:20:37
They're not saved with your Google account. So I'm gonna click on hide conversation and it's gone.
1:20:43
Now, notice here it gives me an option to find a chat. I will need the name of the person I chatted with to find it.
1:20:50
So I type their name in or find them from my frequent list for contacts,
1:20:56
and you'll notice that it puts that chat conversation back over here. My list of recent chats.
1:21:02
To delete a chat, you're going to come to the left hand side again, or I should say to the vertical ellipses.
1:21:08
It's on the right. And you'll see there is a delete conversation button. When I click on this, it deletes the entire conversation.
1:21:17
But notice it tells me here that other participants, the people that have been in the chat with me, will still be able to view it.
1:21:25
The only person who will have it deleted is me. Also, it's important to notice that this is a permanent thing,
1:21:32
so only do it when you need to. When I click on delete, it'll be gone.
1:21:37
So in a normal Gmail account, you can hide chats, you can delete chats, you can't, however edit them.
1:21:44
And this can be a little bit frustrating. You can only edit or delete a Google Chat if you use a chat
1:21:51
on a work or school account. Now, I showed you here that I could delete it, but I couldn't edit it.
1:21:56
So again, it's limited functionality in the normal Gmail account's, not associated with, for example, my work or school.
1:22:07
Welcome back everybody. We wanna show you a feature called Google Spaces. Now, people will ask, why do you have both Google Chat and Google Spaces?
Creating Spaces
1:22:16
Well, the Gmail and Chat app is more for text-based communication, whereas
1:22:22
spaces can allow you and the groups that you work with to communicate in threads, upload files, assign tasks.
1:22:28
So it's a much more complex application than just sending messages that the Google Chat provides.
1:22:34
And your Google Chats can also be part of your experience inside spaces. So I'm inside my Gmail account, and you'll see that over here on the left.
1:22:42
I have an area called Spaces, and another way to check for this is to make sure that your chat is turned on.
1:22:49
Remember, you can go up to the cog in the top right hand corner to double check that your chat's on, but now that we can see the spaces area over
1:22:57
on the left, I wanna create a space. So to do this, I'm gonna come over to Spaces and Click.
1:23:04
Now I don't have any spaces yet. This will be my first one. So you'll see that when I come in, it gives me two options.
1:23:10
One is to create a space. The second one is to browse existing spaces.
1:23:15
Since this is our first one, we're going to create a space. So I'm gonna click on Create a Space.
1:23:21
It wants me to give it a name. I'm gonna call mine Project abc.
1:23:28
Notice that you can add a description that's of course, arbitrary, but it's always nice if the space is going to be used, especially for a group who may
1:23:35
not necessarily know, but it's for now. Importantly, down below, I need to enter in the names or emails of the
1:23:44
people that will be part of my space. Now, there are two places this can come from. The first one are your Google contacts, the people that you've saved, that
1:23:52
you send email to and communicate with through your Google Suite. The second one would be email addresses.
1:23:58
You'll see right here that anyone that's been added to my contacts is available, so I can select their name.
1:24:03
I can also copy and place an email address in. And also, if you were to start typing someone's name in and they
1:24:10
were actually in your contacts, it would also find them for you. Now, additionally, I need to click on create at the bottom.
1:24:17
This is what will actually make my new space. I can always add more people to the space later on, but now the space is created.
1:24:24
Go into your own Google account and try making a space of your own and join us as we're gonna continue our journey, looking at how you can share files and communicate
1:24:33
in this area, in your Google Suite. Hi everybody. Welcome back.
Adding Members to Spaces and Threaded Space Chat
1:24:38
I wanna show you how to add an additional member to your Google space and also how to start some threaded chats.
1:24:45
Now, from my Gmail, I'm gonna come over here to the left hand navigation pane and locate the spaces icon.
1:24:51
This will open up again, another area where you can see any existing spaces you've created, or also at the top create a new space.
1:24:59
I'm gonna go ahead and click on my project ABC space that I recently created.
1:25:04
Now from here you're gonna see ongoing conversations, and then at the top it shows me the name of the space and how many members are
1:25:11
currently in my workspace or space. I'm gonna click on the arrow next to the title and you'll see a dropdown
1:25:17
to help you manage the space. The very top is a manage members option. This is where you can go in to see who the current members of your
1:25:25
Google space are and add new people. Now who can be part of your space. Usually it needs to be someone with a Gmail.
1:25:32
At the end of their, again, email account, I'm gonna click on add and type in the member of another person who's going to add.
1:25:39
Or become a part of my space. Now, they will get an invitation, and once they accept that invitation,
1:25:46
then they'll be added to my space. So once they click on add, I won't see them get added until
1:25:51
they've accepted that invitation. Now I also want to contribute to one of the conversations that's
1:25:56
ongoing between space members. So what I'm gonna do is go back to my space by clicking on its name.
1:26:02
You'll see the current conversation thread. Now, if I would like to respond to an insight thread,
1:26:08
you'll see that right here. It shows me that within this thread, there are some additional replies. When I click on this, it opens up a secondary menu over on the right that
1:26:17
shows me I'm in a threaded conversation. Pain
1:26:23
I can add to it just by adding it into this pop out pain.
1:26:32
Anyone who is in, again, the space can contribute to the conversation, but if I ever want to close it back up again, I can either click on the X
1:26:40
in the top right corner, or I can open it up again just by coming right here and seeing how many replies there are to that specific piece of information.
1:26:49
Now, we'd love to have you try this out. So in your own space, try creating a threaded chat and also try out
1:26:56
adding some new members to the group.
Sharing Files Through Spaces
1:27:01
Hi everybody. I'm ready to share a file in my Google Spaces area. So what I've done is I've come back into my space and I'm
1:27:08
starting a new conversation. I'm gonna go ahead and paste in some text to preface the file that I'll be sharing through my again chat area.
1:27:16
And then I just want you to notice that on the right hand side of the conversations area, you have formatting buttons.
1:27:22
You can also add emoticons gif fees. Then the fourth button over from the right is the upload file button.
1:27:29
This allows you to find a file that's saved locally on your computer or network. Navigate to that file and then actually upload it into your chat.
1:27:38
So this can take a little bit of time depending on the size of the file, but you can see right here, it even shows me the type of file it is.
1:27:45
It's a simple Excel file, and it even shows me a preview when possible to actually send it.
1:27:50
I'm going to come right here and click on the send button now, who will have access to this file? That's a really good question.
1:27:56
Anyone who's in my space will now have access to this file. You can see here that it's been shared again in my chat of my space.
1:28:04
Now, if I come to the file after it's been posted, I can click on it and where it can, it will actually preview what the file looks
1:28:10
like for me so that I can see it. Notice at the top, there's a button here that will allow me to
1:28:15
go back to my Google Spaces area. In addition, I have a print button and also an opportunity to download the file.
1:28:22
So when I share a file this way, it's actually in my opinion, better than emailing it because we can all have access to the file without actually
1:28:30
having to download it to our device, and it's a great way to collaborate. Now that the file's been shared, everyone again, who is part of this Google
1:28:38
space, will have access to the file. Again, go into your own Google space, try it out.
1:28:44
It's a really great way to add collaboration to the communication that you're already having inside of your spaces area.
Creating, Assigning, and Marking Tasks as Complete
1:28:53
Hey everybody. Welcome back. What if you have a task that you need people to work on within your
1:28:58
Google space, and what happens to those files that you share in the chat of your Google space?
1:29:03
Well, let's take a look. I'm in one of my Google spaces, and you'll see that at the top I actually have a chat button.
1:29:08
That's where you spend most of your time and your communicating. But as files are shared as they have been in this Google space, you'll see
1:29:16
there's also a second tab for files. So even though you share the file through the Google Space area, it's
1:29:22
actually stored in the files area. This is kind of like group cloud storage where everyone in the space
1:29:28
can have access to these files, and it makes it a little bit easier to find the files if you come here.
1:29:33
So any of the files that I share through the chat can be accessed here. Notice over on the right, in addition, it gives me an opportunity
1:29:40
right here you'll see to actually view these files in the chat. So if I click right here, it takes me in and shows me where the file was
1:29:48
originally added to the space area. Now another question comes up when we need to get something done.
1:29:54
How do we track that in our space? Well, there's also a tab for that called tasks, and notice that if I come down,
1:30:01
I'm gonna see that in my chat area. It's actually already mentioned two different tasks that
1:30:07
have been already added. So when you add a task to the task area of your space, it mentions
1:30:13
it here inside the chat area. So if people aren't focused on the tasks tab, they can still
1:30:19
know that tasks are being added. When you go to the tasks area, you'll see tasks, the dates that they need
1:30:25
to be again completed and who they've been assigned to within the space. In the top right hand corner, there's a button that will allow
1:30:32
you to update the order, again, of the different tasks you're seeing. By default, they're going to be listed in ascending order with
1:30:39
the newest tasks at the top. Now what I wanna do here is come right here to the top to add a new task, and I
1:30:45
just need to type in the name of my task.
1:30:55
There's an additional space to add details. And then over on the right, I need to pick the date and time that the task will be due.
1:31:02
Notice you pick the date and then down below you can pick a specific time. The time is optional. You don't have to do that, but if you want to be that specific, you can be.
1:31:11
And the other great thing is every member of your space can be assigned this task. So I'm actually gonna assign this task to my coworker, and when I'm
1:31:19
finished, I'm gonna click on add. Now I see it get added here, but also if I wanted to go out and see
1:31:25
where it's been mentioned inside the chat, I can click right here. It takes me out. And it also includes an app mentioned to the work I should say to my spaces
1:31:34
member who's been assigned the task. When I come back, you're gonna notice on the right hand side of every task
1:31:40
there's a delete button and everyone who is a member of this space will
1:31:45
see this task pain and be able to come in and participate in the tasks. All you have to do to Mark Task Complete is click on it and it actually checks
1:31:53
it off and notice it completes it down here at the bottom, you can see that it tells you the task has been completed.
1:31:59
There's also an undue button, and I even see it gray out right here. If I decide that, for example, I wanna come in and un have a task be
1:32:06
not completed, I can uncheck it and it marks it as being uncomplete. It's a very simple, great way to keep track of who's doing what when you're
1:32:15
working together in a Google space, go in and try creating some tasks of your own and uh, keep up with what you're getting done inside of Google Spaces.
Deleting Spaces
1:32:26
Hey everybody. Welcome back. I wanna show you how to delete a Google space. If it ends up, you don't need it anymore.
1:32:32
Now remember, you can only delete a space if you're the space creator. When you delete a space, all the messages and tasks in the space are also deleted.
1:32:40
Permissions on the files that are shared in the space are removed, but the file isn't deleted.
1:32:46
And once a space is deleted, you can't get it back. So it's nonrecoverable. But the good news is you can get rid of a space if you no longer need it.
1:32:54
Now, I'm the one who created my spaces, so I'm gonna come in right here and go to the spaces area. From my Gmail.
1:33:00
You'll see that I have two spaces here. I am the originator or creator of both the spaces.
1:33:06
I can see that because when I come in and look at the space and click on it, if I come right here and actually go in and look at the member details or
1:33:13
manage members, I'm the space manager. This means I'm the person that the space started with.
1:33:20
That means I can delete it To delete this space. I'm gonna go back in and just click on this space name, and then you'll see
1:33:27
right here that I have this chat area. What I wanna do is come up above it and click back on the space name again,
1:33:34
and then come down to the very bottom. And because again, I was the space manager or the person who
1:33:40
created the space, I can delete it. When I click on delete, it reminds me that all the messages and tasks that
1:33:48
are part of the space will be deleted. The files won't be, when I click on delete, you'll see
1:33:53
that it's no longer in my space navigation pane, so now it's gone. So they're really easy to create and delete.
1:34:00
Just remember that once they're deleted, all the content inside of them will also be.
Adding Video Meetings to Google Space
1:34:08
Hi everybody. I wanna just mention a few important points about managing a Google space
1:34:13
and also about adding a video meeting to, again, a Google Space area.
1:34:19
So I'm back inside my Google space and I'm gonna come up to the current space that I want to manage and click on its name.
1:34:26
You'll see that when I do this, I get a menu to help me do important things. Now, we've already looked at how to manage the membership of your Google space, but
1:34:34
notice right here you can also set up notifications for how new messages and replies are going to occur in the space.
1:34:40
You can also turn off your chat history. This means that after 24 hours, all the messages in the space will be deleted.
1:34:47
And then notice if you are a member of a Google space and decide you no longer want to be, you can leave it and then additionally deleting it.
1:34:55
Now the final area that we wanna talk about with spaces is how to add a video meeting to your Google Workspace.
1:35:01
You can see an example of one right here. Now, how was this done? I'm gonna come in and I'm actually gonna go to a new chat, and you'll
1:35:09
see that on the far right hand side there is a small video camera. This allows me to add a video meeting to my current workspace chat area.
1:35:17
When I click on this, you'll see that it opens up a little icon that looks like a video camera.
1:35:23
This is for me to have kind of a spontaneous video meeting. If I click on this, once I send it, it's going to post it into my chat feed
1:35:31
for all the members of my Google Space. When I click on it, it will take me into the Google Meet tool that
1:35:37
allows me to do video meetings. Now with these meetings, you can have up to a hundred participants and a 60 minute
1:35:43
meeting that doesn't cost any money. Right here, you're gonna see that when I'm ready to join, I can click
1:35:48
on join now, and it will actually take me in to my video meeting. Down on the bottom, I've got great tools like the ability to mute and unmute
1:35:56
my mic, also control my video camera. Lots of great features, and anyone who's part of my Google space
1:36:03
would see that meeting inside my chat area of my Google space. And they would also be able to join this meeting as well.
1:36:10
It's a great way to make your spaces a lot more interactive and engaging when you add the meeting feature.
1:36:16
And as always, after the meeting's over, if I were to go back to my Google space, I'd see that the mention of the video meeting is inside the chat is
1:36:25
a history to let everybody know that there was a meeting that happened. So try it out. Go into your own Google Workspace, I should say, space, and try adding
1:36:34
a video meeting to your space area and see if you can get some of your fellow Google Space members to join it.
Joining or Creating Instant Meetings with Google Meet
1:36:42
Welcome back everybody. I wanna show you how to actually create your own video meeting from inside Gmail.
1:36:48
Over on the left hand side, I have the Meet feature turned on. Once I click on this, you're gonna see that it takes me into my meet area.
1:36:56
This is where I can set up impromptu meetings right here. You'll notice that it gives me a new meeting option and also join with code.
1:37:03
This is where someone can give you a code to their own Google video meeting that you can type in here.
1:37:09
Copy and paste is easier. And then join the meeting to create a new instant meeting. I just click on new meeting.
1:37:14
It opens up right here. And notice that I can start the instant meeting right here, or I can copy this
1:37:19
link and actually email it to someone. Now I'd like to send this invite to a coworker or to someone
1:37:25
that I'm gonna be working with. So I'm gonna click on Send Invite. You'll see that I can share via email.
1:37:30
It takes me into a new tab in my email. It includes all the different meeting information, including
1:37:35
the meeting, the link. And then I'm gonna go ahead and shoot it off to the coworker that I want to send the meeting invite to, and I can send it right from Gmail.
1:37:44
The Google meet is still going to be open right here, but I'm emailing them an invitation to my meeting.
1:37:49
Now, if it ends up that I'd like to just do an impromptu meeting, I'm gonna come in and just do new meeting.
1:37:56
And then I'm going to come in and say, start now. So this just means a meeting that will be what we call impromptu
1:38:01
or spontaneous on the fly. There's a lot of different names for these kinds of meetings. When I start now, I will be the only one in this meeting, so
1:38:09
hopefully I have copied that code and I've sent it to my coworkers. But you can see here how it's connecting.
1:38:16
I have my video camera turned off and notice I can toggle my video on. Also, I have my ability to mute and unmute myself.
1:38:23
I have closed captioning along with the ability to raise my hand during a meeting, add emoticons.
1:38:30
And then even if you'll see right here, I can present my screen and some additional features, including a whiteboard, for example.
1:38:36
And also when I'm done, I can click on the leave call button and it will end my video meeting.
1:38:42
But it's great that right from Gmail, I can communicate with my coworkers and go in and create a video meeting using the meet feature.
1:38:50
So go into your own Gmail and try creating a video meeting and see how it really adds to how you can communicate with your coworkers or with others
1:38:59
that you work with through Gmail.
Joining Meetings from Google Space
1:39:04
Hi everyone. I wanna show you how to join a video meeting from your Google space.
1:39:10
So inside my Google space, I see that there's a meeting that was started by my coworker.
1:39:15
And I would like to join it underneath where it mentions the meeting. In the chat area, there is a link that when I hover over,
1:39:21
it'll say, join video meeting. When I click on this, it takes me into another browser tab.
1:39:27
Notice up here. This is the pre joinin screen from my Google video meeting. It tells me who's already in the meeting.
1:39:34
And notice right here I can decide if I want to join with my video and audio on, or like one of my best practices for joining Google meetings
1:39:41
is to always join with my audio off, just in case, for example, my dog goes berserk in the background.
1:39:47
I'm gonna click right here on Join. Now, this will join me into the meeting. You'll notice that I'm joining with my video and audio off, but once I'm in the
1:39:55
meeting, I can again turn these toggles on and off to enable those different things. And also in the bottom right corner of my Google meeting, I can see who's
1:40:03
currently in the meeting with me. So all my coworkers, and again space members will come up in this list.
1:40:09
I can also see if their audio is muted. And remember, inside these Google meetings, you have great tools
1:40:15
like the capacity to present from your screen, add reactions even. For example, raise your hand when I'm done with my meeting that
1:40:22
I joined from my Google space. All I need to do is click on the leave call button and I'm able to leave the meeting and I can always come back and close the tab that
1:40:30
opened and I'll be back in my Google space area ready to continue working. This won't kick anyone else who's in the meeting out.
1:40:37
It would allow them to continue working. But again, it's great that I have this ability to go from a chat.
1:40:43
To a virtual meeting and then come right back out and continue doing what I was doing before.
1:40:49
Really try this in your own Google space. Go in and try to add a video meeting and join it and see how it can
1:40:54
really add to the collaboration that you have within your Google space.
Accessing and Saving Contacts
1:41:02
Hi everyone. An important part of being able to communicate and collaborate with people using the Google Suite is keeping track of their contact information.
1:41:11
Google's very aware of this, and that's why for a very long time, not only have you been able to manage your email through your Google Suite, but you
1:41:18
also have access to Google Contacts. This is one of the most widely used contact management tools available to
1:41:24
people, and it's an essential part of Google's suite of web applications. It's gonna store your contact information, both for personal
1:41:31
and professional purposes. So let's look at how you access your Google contacts from your Gmail account.
1:41:37
So right now, I'm in my Gmail. Now the contacts are actually stored in the Google Suite, but not actually in your Gmail.
1:41:44
There are different ways to access them, but I'm gonna show you the main front door. I'm gonna come to the top right hand corner to the waffle button that allows
1:41:51
me access to my other Google apps. Remember, it looks like a Rubik's Cube, but it's called the Google App button.
1:41:58
When I click on this, I see the other apps that are available from my Gmail account, and if I come down, I'll see that Contacts is one of the apps under this list.
1:42:07
When I click on it, it's going to open up a new browser tab. So again, my Gmail will be opened in the first browser tab, but now I'll see that
1:42:14
the second one is called Google Contacts. We can see it up here. And this is taking me into the contacts that I currently have stored.
1:42:21
Now, manual way to create a new contact is to come to the top left hand corner, and after I click on it, I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to click on the
1:42:30
create contact button in the top left. This will allow me to either create one contact at a time or multiple contacts.
1:42:38
We're gonna start with just one. I type in the name of the person, and obviously I can also copy and
1:42:46
paste and notice that it's going to include important information like company name, title,
1:42:57
and email. I can also include information like their phone number, birthday notes,
1:43:02
and there are additional fields as well that can give me even more detail. When I'm done, I'm gonna click on save.
1:43:09
And now this contact will be saved with my Google account, which means no matter where I go on what computer, if I have a secure login,
1:43:16
I'll be able to access this content. And also the contacts information. It's a great way to create your own list of people that you work with.
1:43:25
That's just part of your Gmail account. Go into your own Google account and try it out. Add some contacts so that you can have that important
1:43:32
information from wherever you go.
1:43:37
Okay, everybody. How do you add an incoming Gmail from someone new to your Google Contacts?
Adding Email to Contacts
1:43:44
It's actually pretty easy to do, but you do need to open up the actual email message. So I've come into my Gmail account and I'm gonna double click on this new message.
1:43:53
When I open it up, you'll see at the top that we can see an icon representing the person that the message is from.
1:43:59
And if I actually hover over this, it shows me contact information for them. And in the top right hand corner, if they have not been added to my Google
1:44:08
Contacts yet, I see a circle with a head and shoulders and a plus sign. If I click on this, it will actually take this person and their email address
1:44:16
and add it to my Google Contacts. Also, notice right here, I can click on open detailed view, and over on the right
1:44:22
it's gonna show me their information. Once I'm done doing that, if I come up to the top right-hand corner, come back
1:44:29
down to my Google apps and go into my contacts, I'll now see that if I look
1:44:34
at this list, the person who I just received that message from has been added. Now, if I'd like to add more detail, I'm gonna come right here on the same
1:44:43
line and click on the pencil on the right hand side of their contact. This will take me in to where I see the basic information that was
1:44:50
provided from the email, which is their name and their email address. If I wanna add additional information, then I need to come in and type
1:44:58
it in because it won't capture a ton from the actual Gmail message
1:45:04
so I can add that additional information and edit the contact. This is a great way to quickly start really building your contact database
1:45:12
by going directly from Gmail and adding those contacts in, and then you can add the details that you want after they've been added from Gmail.
1:45:20
Go into your own Gmail and try adding some contacts again from the people who are already sending you email messages.
1:45:25
It's a great way to work and really build that list of contacts so that you have it for when you need it.
Adding Labels to Contacts
1:45:33
Hey everybody. What about being able to manage your contacts with categories of your own?
1:45:39
Now, we looked at this in the Gmail part one, but now we wanna look at the idea of applying a Google label to our contacts.
1:45:47
You'll see that right now in my contacts. I do have one label. It's turned on under my labels category right here, and it's my work category.
1:45:55
What if I'd also like to create a label called Personal that I could apply to my contacts? What I wanna do for this is come over to the left hand side of my contacts list,
1:46:04
and I'll see that I have a labels area where I can come down and create a label.
1:46:10
All I need to do is provide my label with a name. I'm gonna type in the word personal and then click on save.
1:46:17
Now once the label has been saved, how do I apply it to the contact? I like to go back to the contact list and actually come to the contact.
1:46:26
I'd like to apply a specific label to, you'll notice that on the right hand side of your different contacts, you have a star that would allow you to,
1:46:33
for example, favorite that contact. But in addition, there's the pencil button to edit, and then the vertical
1:46:39
ellipses, this is the more button. When I click on it, I'm going to see, again, the ability to print and export
1:46:45
my contacts, but also apply labels. I'm gonna click on personal, and once I do that, when I come out, I'll see
1:46:51
the personal label has been applied, so it's fairly easy for me to go down through my contact list and just use this vertical ellipses to actually
1:46:59
apply different labels to each of my contacts until I've gotten them applied. Now, what's the use case?
1:47:05
Once I've applied labels to my contacts, I can now come over to my navigation pane in my contacts view, and when I wanna see all of my work contacts, I click on the work
1:47:15
label and only my work contacts come up. If I want to come in and adjust my personal contacts, I can click
1:47:22
on that and then I see those. And at any time I want to adjust one of the labels I've applied. I can go back to the ellipses, next to the label, just come to the check mark
1:47:30
and say, remove from label, and it will remove that contact from that label. It does not remove it from my contacts list, it just takes the label off.
1:47:41
It's a great way to create your own categories for your contacts. That you can then filter by using the label.
1:47:47
Go into your own Google contacts, try to create a couple of labels and apply them and see how it really makes keeping things organized a lot easier.
Editing, Printing, and Deleting Contacts
1:47:57
Hello? What if you need to just have your contact on paper? You can print your contacts from Google in a number of different ways.
1:48:05
So I'm in my contacts inside of my Google account, and I have a couple of different options. The first one is to come to the contact I wanna print, just check mark the
1:48:14
name, and then come up to the vertical ellipses on the toolbar above the contact. When I do this, it gives me an option to print my contact.
1:48:22
You'll see that it will ask me that I'm only printing one selected contact. It'll take me into a print preview.
1:48:28
This particular contact only includes the person's name and email address, and then I can click on print.
1:48:34
What about if I want to print from inside the contact? I'm gonna open the contact up by clicking on it.
1:48:41
I see the contact card, and then I'm gonna come up to the top right corner and look for the ellipses.
1:48:47
This is also my way to edit the details behind the contact and work with it. When I click on this ellipses, again, I get an option to print the contact.
1:48:56
When I click on this, it takes me in and again, I'll see more detail and then I can click on print and it prints it off.
1:49:03
Now, in addition, if I ever want to go in and edit a contact notice from the contact card, I have an edit button right here.
1:49:09
This'll take me in so that I can add details to the contact. And of course, after I make those changes, I can save the changes just
1:49:16
by clicking on the save button and it will update everything in my contact. Additionally, a contact can be deleted and there are multiple options for that.
1:49:24
I like to go to my contact list, select a contact, and if I want for any reason to delete them.
1:49:30
Once they're selected, you'll notice here that there is three dots next to the row that they're on where I can delete.
1:49:36
Also, up at the top, you're gonna see that there's an option to delete the contact from there as well.
1:49:42
Keep in mind, you can also export your contacts when you export them. They can be exported either as a Google CSV file or an outlet CSV file, or even a
1:49:51
V card that works for Apple devices, and by exporting them, then you can import
1:49:57
them into maybe a contact management system for that particular device. But really what you're gonna see is that working with contacts is pretty easy.
1:50:05
So go into your own Google contacts and try working with them.
1:50:11
Welcome back. I need to spend a little bit more time managing my contacts. First of all, in Google Contacts.
Recovering Deleted Contacts
1:50:18
Where do I go for the settings of my Google Contacts app? Well, we have Google Contacts open.
1:50:23
I'm gonna go to the top right hand corner to the settings menu because I'm in my Google Contacts.
1:50:28
When I click on the settings gear, that's what I see. If I come down to more settings, you'll see it takes me into the basic
1:50:35
settings of my contacts application. They include my default country. You'll notice when I click here, it opens up another browser tab and shows
1:50:43
me what my default language is, mine's English, and additionally, it will let me also decide what country I'm from.
1:50:50
And then how to sort my contacts. I can either sort them by first name or last name, and I can say those.
1:50:55
So it's pretty basic. Now, additionally, if I would like to print all the contacts in my contact
1:51:01
list, you'll see that over in my contacts navigation pane, there is a print button. This is really great when you just wanna contact, print all your contacts.
1:51:10
When I click on print, you'll show that it prints me off a list, which can be nice when you want a comprehensive list.
1:51:16
What if I've deleted a contact? So if I come in and click on a contact, select it, and then come up
1:51:21
to the ellipses and delete it, it's removed from my contact list, I'm going to move it to my trash can.
1:51:28
But notice right here, it will tell me that any contacts that I delete will be permanently deleted after 30 days.
1:51:35
So Google gives me a 30 day grace period. Now, in the meantime, those contacts are actually here in my trash, much
1:51:43
like my Gmail that gets deleted. But here I won't see emails. I'll see my Google contacts.
1:51:49
If there are contacts here that I don't want permanently deleted, I get that 30 day grace period. After that, they will be permanently deleted.
1:51:56
And notice it tells me that also that I can empty the trash. But let's say I don't want these contacts deleted.
1:52:02
I've accidentally placed them here and I need to get them back out. I can select both of them by checking them off and up above
1:52:09
I'll now see a recover option. This allows me to actually take these contacts and remove
1:52:15
them from the trash can. And if I go back to my contacts list, it places them right back where they were before.
1:52:22
So if you accidentally delete a contact, it's okay. Go to your trash, can select it and recover it back out.
1:52:29
But remember, you only get 30 days after that, your contacts will be permanently deleted.
1:52:36
So feel free to go into your Google contacts and try this out. Just make sure you recover the contacts if you're playing with it.
Accessing and Adjusting Google Calendar View
1:52:47
Hi everyone. We are ready to talk about one of my favorite features that comes with the Google Suite, and that is how easy it is to access your Google Calendar from Gmail.
1:52:57
When you sign up for a Google account, you automatically have access to this fantastic calendar app and it's really easy to get to from your Gmail.
1:53:06
So here I am in my Gmail. And to access the calendar, I'm gonna come up to the Google app
1:53:11
bar in the top right hand corner. Remember, it looks like Rubik's Cube. When you click on it, you're gonna see the other apps that come
1:53:18
with your Google Suite Go down until you see the calendar icon. It's pretty easy to find when you left.
1:53:25
Click on it. It will launch your calendar in a separate browser tab. Now let's talk for a minute about how you can update your view.
1:53:32
When you're in this calendar. You'll see that in the top right hand corner, you've got two important options.
1:53:38
The first one is it will tell you what time sequence you're in right now. So right now I'm viewing a month view, but if I click on this, you'll notice
1:53:45
that I can view my calendar by the day. I can also view it by the week, and by default it will include weekends.
1:53:54
I can also see it by month, year, and then even four day stretches of time.
1:53:59
Now, a couple of additional things you can also do when you're in this notice that if you don't want your weekends, you can come down and uncheck this
1:54:07
bottom option and it will turn it off. Now, as far as calendar settings, you'll see that on the left hand
1:54:13
side of that, again time setting, you have your settings menu. This allows you to go into your settings for your calendar.
1:54:20
This will again let you make sure that you have the correct time zone selected, and also the format that you want the dates to be showing in.
1:54:28
To get out of this, if you just click on the back arrow in the top left hand corner, next to settings, it will take you back to your calendar.
1:54:34
There's also in the top left hand corner toggles to allow you to take the calendar and go between different time increments.
1:54:41
So since I'm in the month view, this will move me forward one month at a time.
1:54:47
And then the today button helps you to always get back to the current day and it'll be highlighted.
1:54:52
So in this case, the current date for me is highlighted with a blue highlight on the particular date.
1:54:58
And if I wanna move to a different day in my calendar, I can come over on the left hand side to the navigation pane.
1:55:03
Click on the date I want to move to, and using the same time increment, it moves me for forward.
1:55:08
It's really a very intuitive, easy to use interface. Google has done a fantastic job making this calendar easy to work with.
1:55:16
It doesn't take very long to get used to. So again, I challenge you to get into your Gmail, open up your
1:55:22
calendar, and just start clicking around and see how easy it is to use.
1:55:29
Hi everyone. I wanna show you how to create an event or a meeting in your Google Calendar and also a recurring event.
Creating Google Calendar Events and Recurring Events
1:55:35
Now, right now I'm seeing my Google calendar in a week view. The weekends are turned on. To create an event, I'm gonna come up to the top left hand
1:55:42
corner to the create button. It's pretty big, so it's hard to miss. When you click on this, I'm gonna select event and it will
1:55:49
open up a new event window. I need to add my title.
1:55:54
Then down below, you'll see the first thing it asks me is going to be the date of my meeting. Now I can update this just by clicking on it, and it will populate again,
1:56:02
a calendar that I can pick from. I can pick the correct date for my meeting, and then also I can
1:56:08
come in and adjust the time. Now remember, these times are coming from the settings of your calendar,
1:56:14
and the reason it's doing one hour settings is because that's the default. There's also an opportunity to do time zone add guests.
1:56:22
These would be coworkers or other people that are in your contacts that you are going to be inviting to attend your meeting.
1:56:29
Additionally, you're gonna see that I can add a Google Meet option to make it into a video conferencing meeting.
1:56:35
This would actually, again, take me into Google Meet and provide that information, and I can have up to a hundred guests attend one of these meetings.
1:56:43
Now, what if I have a file that I'd like to also add to the meeting? As you come down, you'll see that.
1:56:49
Additionally, I can add descriptions or attachments. Remember, the attachments can either come from your Google
1:56:55
Drive or you can upload them. Once you add an attachment, it will be copied into the meeting
1:57:01
invite, and all you have to do to send it off is click on save. Now the people you've invited to the meeting will also receive an invite
1:57:08
in their Google Gmail account or through email to your Google meeting. So I'm going to save it and I'll just write here.
1:57:15
It's asking me if I would like to send calendar invitations to guests. I would. So I'm gonna click on send, and it's been saved and added to my calendar.
1:57:23
Now again, for me to be able to see the meeting, I need to go to the day, here's the actual calendar event, and if I click on it, it will open up.
1:57:30
Now what about a reoccurring calendar event? The only difference is that you set a recurring pattern
1:57:36
when you create the event. So I'm gonna come back up to create Go to event again, type in the name of the event,
1:57:45
and then underneath where I pick the date for the meeting to begin. What's really important is after I pick my first date for the meeting,
1:57:52
then I set up a recurrence pattern. Right now it says, do not repeat, but notice I can now
1:57:57
say weekly, every Wednesday. I can also set up a custom pattern where I say, and after a certain amount of time,
1:58:05
and I can also adjust the time as well. This will make this into a meeting that will recur every Wednesday, starting
1:58:11
March 8th, and then when I click on save, it will get added to my calendar, but it will be recurring for those 13 occurrences, and then it will turn off.
1:58:20
Now, as always, go in and try this out. Go to your Google calendar, try creating a couple of events.
1:58:26
They're also really easy to delete because after you create one, if you decide you don't need it anymore, open it up.
1:58:32
Notice in the top right hand corner, there's a trash can. And if I delete on this, if I click on it, if it's a recurring event,
1:58:38
it'll ask me to either delete just this one or all the events. If I do just the event, then all the other ones will still be in my calendar,
1:58:45
but it's really easy to remove them. So make some of your own and try it out.
Responding to Google Calendar Invites
1:58:53
Okay, I want to respond to a calendar event invite in my Google Gmail account.
1:58:59
So I've come into my inbox, I can see the, again, calendar invite right here. I'm gonna click on it and it opens it up.
1:59:05
One great thing that Google has done here is put everything you need right at the top. You're gonna see the name of the meeting.
1:59:11
Also the date, time and time zone, and then also who it's from. Coming down, I can see my opportunities to respond.
1:59:19
Yes means I'm coming. Maybe it's tentative and no means I'm not going to come.
1:59:25
Notice the color. There's also a more options button on the right hand side of the no button, allowing you to propose a new time or add an additional note about the meeting.
1:59:34
Yes, I am going to be going. Now, if this is a video conferencing meeting, notice the Google Meet is
1:59:40
here as well, with a link and a meeting link under that, down on the bottom. If I respond with a yes, you'll see it actually opens up a new browser tab.
1:59:49
It can take just a few moments to open, takes me into my calendar, and if I look
1:59:55
at my calendar, I can see right here that the meeting has been added to my calendar. And if I open it up, I can see again the same information, the name of the
2:00:04
meeting, the date and time, and then who again the meeting organizer is. This is the coworker or person that sent me the meeting invite
2:00:12
and the green check mark meeting. Yes, I will be attending the meeting. So it's really great because you can go straight from your Gmail into your
2:00:19
Google calendar and see these events get added and it's really easy to do. So don't be afraid to try sending someone a calendar invite and watch them respond
2:00:28
and see how it keeps track of all of it right inside of your Google calendar. It's pretty cool.
Sharing Calendars and Editing Calendar Events
2:00:34
Welcome back. I wanna show you how to share a calendar, edit a calendar, and also viewing other calendars.
2:00:40
So I'm back in my Gmail calendar or Google calendar, and I'd like to share a calendar
2:00:46
with someone that I work closely with. Remember, when you share calendars, it's important to be aware of the
2:00:51
permissions that you're providing to the person you're sharing the calendar with. So only share the calendar with people you trust.
2:00:57
Right here on the left, I'm gonna see my calendar. This is the calendar with my name or the person I'm playing.
2:01:03
There's an ellipses that appears next to it. I'm gonna click on that and then I'm gonna come to settings and sharing.
2:01:09
This takes me not only into the sharing of the calendar, but also the personal settings for it. This includes information like the name of the calendar, it's time zone,
2:01:18
but as I come down, you'll notice that right here I can add other people and groups to this calendar.
2:01:24
So when I click on this, brings up a list of the people who are in my contacts. I can select one of them, and then underneath, I also need to decide what
2:01:33
level of permission I'm giving them. If I wanna give them limited access, I can pick the top level.
2:01:38
Make sure you realize what you're sharing when you do this, and then click on send. They'll receive an invitation to my calendar in their own Gmail account.
2:01:46
Then when they click on, they'll be able to see it over here. Now, if I ever need to edit a calendar event, what I want to do is come
2:01:53
to the event I want to edit, click on it, and at the top I'll see an edit button, which is a pencil.
2:01:59
This will allow me to come in and actually add information up, update times of an event.
2:02:04
For example, maybe I need to change the week that the meeting's happening on. I can make that update.
2:02:10
You'll notice here, this is a recurring event, so when I make this change, it'll warn me that it's being adjusted When I click on, okay, it will change it.
2:02:17
And if there are other events, because it's recurring, they will also be adjusted for me.
2:02:23
Remember that any additional calendars will show up here over on the left, under other calendars.
2:02:29
This is where you can go to expand and collapse them. Like right now, I have another Google Calendar showing me holidays, which is a default.
2:02:35
If I uncheck it, it would turn off all the United States holidays that are in my calendar. So adding additional calendars, all you have to do is click on this plus sign.
2:02:43
You can go in and create new calendars or browse for calendars that are provided by Google and other providers.
2:02:49
Or you can also import calendars. So there's a lot of opportunities to enlarge what you're seeing inside
2:02:54
this calendar, and it's great to also view other people's calendars. Again, go into your own Google Calendar, create some events.
2:03:01
Look at how you can share your calendar with other people, and then also how easy it is to edit calendar event.
Updating Calendar Settings and Searching Calendars
2:03:11
Welcome back. I need to search my calendar. I also need to view calendar settings. Searching your calendar is really easy because again,
2:03:18
Google is so good at search. If you come to the top right hand corner of the calendar, no matter what view
2:03:23
you're in, you'll see a magnifying glass, which means to look for something. When you click on this, you can type in a keyword, a person, a date,
2:03:31
but to refine your search, make sure you go to the right hand side. You'll see an arrow for search options.
2:03:38
This will take you in to where you can decide what calendars you're looking through, also what you're looking for, any people involved in the calendar,
2:03:46
event, locations, and even dates. When you click on search, it goes through and looks for any events that match that.
2:03:53
And if you click on one event, it'll actually open it up so that you can go into the event card or even edit.
2:03:59
When you're done with your search, you can click on the X to clear it out and then go back and it'll take you back to your calendar.
2:04:05
Now remember, every calendar has settings for the settings of the calendar app itself. Go to the top right hand corner and click on the settings
2:04:13
menu gear and go to settings. This will let you go into the settings of the calendar app.
2:04:18
The other place you can go to get to the settings of a specific calendar are to go down to your My Calendars view.
2:04:25
Go to the calendar in question, go to the vertical ellipses on the side of it, click and then select settings and sharing.
2:04:32
These will take you into the settings for a specific calendar, cuz different calendars can have different time zones and also different features.
2:04:40
So remember, it depends on what setting area you're looking at. Go into your own Google Calendar and look at these areas so you
2:04:47
feel comfortable finding them. Cuz it's important to have your settings in a way that works for you.
Using Google Keep for Notes
2:04:56
Hey, have you ever had a note that you just wanna be able to keep track of that may not relate directly to an email.
2:05:01
It's just like a note to yourself. Well, inside your Google Suite, there's a great little app called Google Keep that I love.
2:05:08
I can use it on my Android or my iPhone and I can also use it on my normal computer To access Google Keep.
2:05:13
You need to go up to your Google App bar and then click on it and come down.
2:05:19
It's Keep, so it's a k. Scroll down until you find, keep, it looks like a little notepad.
2:05:25
When you click on it, it will open in its own browser tab. Now with keep, you're just basically creating electronic sticky notes.
2:05:31
You'll see that at the top there's a place where you can type a note. So right here, notice I have to give my title at the top of my note,
2:05:42
and then I can actually type in the items that I want in my note.
2:05:48
Your notes can have hyperlinks, they can have a lot of different kinds of information in them. In addition, you can actually give your notes different colors.
2:05:56
You can even apply backgrounds to them like this, and you'll also see that inside each note once you create it.
2:06:02
If you come down, you can go back and edit your notes at any time just by clicking on them at the bottom.
2:06:08
You can add images, you can also archive notes, and then there are more options being able to delete a note, even assign a label.
2:06:14
Now, if your note really important, what I recommend is coming to the top right hand corner of the note and pinning it.
2:06:21
That way, it's gonna be favored up here at the top with your important pins. As time goes by, you can unpin a note just by going to the top right hand corner,
2:06:28
clicking on the pin and it unins it and puts it back here under your other ones. Also, if you go to any note and double click on it or click on
2:06:37
it once, it'll open up larger. You can actually share some of your notes with other people that are part of your
2:06:43
Google contacts, and that's why you'll see their initials with their name. Or, for example, this just shows the first letter of their name in the bottom corner,
2:06:51
and it's a great way just to keep track of things that you don't want to forget and it goes with your Google account.
2:06:57
So try it out. Google Keep super easy. Finally, if you need to delete a note, all you wanna do is go to the
2:07:03
note, click on the bottom right hand corner on the ellipses, come in, and you can just click on delete and it will allow you to get rid of it.
Creating and Scheduling Tasks
2:07:15
What about all the stuff you just need to keep track of? We've talked about this a little bit, but there's an awesome app that's also part
2:07:21
of your Google Suite that you get when you sign up for Gmail called Google Tasks. Right now I'm in my inbox and all I need to do to open up my task
2:07:29
list is come to the right hand side below my Google app button. I'll see a blue circle with a blue check mark inside of it.
2:07:37
When I click on this, it opens up my task list. Now I can just have standalone tasks or tasks that I schedule at the top.
2:07:45
I can click on add a task. I'm gonna type in what this is.
2:07:55
Notice that underneath I can enter details, and then also
2:08:02
a date and time when I want to have this task accomplished. I can set the date and then also the time.
2:08:08
Now, this is going to create a scheduled task and I can continue to add more tasks to this list.
2:08:16
What's interesting though, at the top is that if I close this, any task that I've scheduled, like this one that's supposed to happen on the 21st at 10 30.
2:08:25
If I now go up and actually open up my Google calendar, a scheduled task not only gets added to your task list, but if I now come in and look at my calendar on
2:08:34
that day, I'm gonna see that I have a new event that's actually a scheduled task.
2:08:39
When I open it up, I'll see that it's not just an event, it's that task that I just created and notice it's saved in my My Tasks list.
2:08:48
This is the automatic list that's created when you add tasks. By default, you can actually create additional tasks of
2:08:54
your own and even task lists. If I wanted to edit my task, I can click on it. I can come in and even edit, for example, the time that I want it to
2:09:02
happen and the list that it's in. So your tasks also occur not just in your task list, but if they're
2:09:09
scheduled, they show up in your calendar. Now, how would you create a task in the calendar without having to go to your task list?
2:09:16
Go here to the plus sign in your calendar, click on it and notice that you can create new events, but also new tasks.
2:09:22
And it's the same idea, it's just it's a to-do rather than something that's gonna happen.
2:09:29
Notice I can pick the date and time when I want the task to happen, but by default this will be a scheduled task.
2:09:36
So when I click on save, I'll notice that it will be added to my calendar, unlike the other tasks that are just in the list.
2:09:43
Now when it comes to managing your tasks, you're gonna open up your task again, paying over on the right, any task you created, you can
2:09:51
come to the ellipses on the side. This will give you options to create a new task list, create a sub-task, or
2:09:57
even delete a task you no longer need. And if it's deleted from your task list, it will also be
2:10:02
deleted from your calendar. So tasks are just a great way to keep track of the stuff that you need to get done.
Turning Email into Tasks and Starring Tasks
2:10:13
Okay. What about when you get an email and you think, oh, I need to add that to my list of things I need to get done.
2:10:19
Is there a way to take an email and turn it into a task? There is. So I'm in my inbox.
2:10:24
I'm gonna come up and turn on my task pain. And then I'm gonna go in and find the specific email that
2:10:30
I'd like to turn into a task. I'm gonna come in, select the email, and I'm going to left, drag
2:10:36
it to the top of my task pane. Notice it will allow me to left drag and drop it in.
2:10:41
Once I get it there, you'll see that it's creating the task for me. What's great about this task is once it's been added, if I click on it to open it
2:10:48
up, it actually has a link to the email. When I click on this, it will open up the email and take me to it.
2:10:55
I can add additional information, like details of when I wanna get the task completed. I can edit that.
2:11:01
The task will still appear in my task list. Now remember that if you wanna mark a task as complete, you just need
2:11:07
to come over and place a check mark in the circle next to the task. It will mark it as complete and remove it from your list of tasks.
2:11:15
Additionally, you can actually favorite tasks or star them. To do that, you're gonna come to the right hand side of the task,
2:11:22
fill in the Stard task option. It just adds a solid star next to that task.
2:11:27
Now, after tasks have been starred, you'll see that up at the top of your task list, you can actually filter your task list by your starred tasks.
2:11:36
These would kind of be the ones you consider to be most important or pressing. Also, I can come in and I can add a task that will be starred automatically, but by
2:11:44
default, your tasks are organized in the My task view, which includes everything.
2:11:49
And also there is an option to create your own custom list of tasks in addition to the ones that come by default with your Google account.
2:11:57
So, you know, try tasks out. It's really nice that you can go from email to a to-do list in the same
2:12:02
window, and it's really easy to manage.
2:12:08
Hi everyone. Thank you so much for joining us for this second part of our Google Gmail course.
Conclusion
2:12:14
In this course, we've explored some of the additional great features that come with your Google account beyond Gmail.
2:12:20
We've explored the ability to use a chat function from your inbox, and also the collaboration available through a Google space where you can
2:12:27
share files and create group tasks. We've also looked at the Google Meet feature that you can bring into your
2:12:33
Google meetings to add video conferencing. We've also looked at some of the additional apps that come with a
2:12:38
Google account, including the Google Contacts application, which allows you
2:12:43
to keep track of people that you work with every day, and also the Google Calendar where you can keep track of the different events that you're
2:12:50
managing right from your Google account. And remember, all of this follows you wherever you go, all you have to do is
2:12:56
log into your Google account and you have access to all these great features. So thanks again for joining us, and as always, please go in and
2:13:03
try these things out, because when you try them, you're using them. And that's really the pathway to learning to make them part
2:13:09
of the way you work every day.

1:48
into some of the features and how it's helpful  there so I mentioned a moment ago that you can go  
1:53
up here and press switch to tasks this essentially  turns into Google Tasks mode and blocks out the  
1:59
entire experience to be focused just on Google  Tasks something they didn't even have before  
2:04
which is a really big time saer so you can scroll  through all of the lists that you create but one  
2:08
of the nice things is you can actually choose what  list you want to appearer so for example if you  
2:13
only want work rated ones and you don't want your  task to relieve on there you can see that they can  
2:18
appear like this now the good thing is you can  move them if you don't find the order to which  
2:22
they create suitable and shuffle them across which  is nice now the benefit to having this view is it  
2:28
it can also be reflective of a can ban experience  so for example if I wanted to get rid of these  
2:34
lists and create do doing done I could create  a task and move them across the relevant areas  
2:39
to indicate the success of a project that I'm  doing so that is one of the benefits of it being  
2:45
canonized and a helpful way for you to organize  stuff now down here you can create a new list  
2:50
and you can add a title of anything list ABC and  you can add a task accordingly and as you can see  
2:56
all the details go in there's a few prompts like  today and you can even set a recurring reminder  
3:01
for example after a certain date or happens every  single day which means that it will nudge you on  
3:05
your phone if you've got push notifications on  ever wanted to automate things but you lack the  
3:10
coding skills you can now do that with zapier with  no code zapia is the leader in automation allowing  
3:16
you to take your workflows to the next level with  a suite of automation tools you can go from an  
3:22
idea to reality in no time setting up triggers for  simple workflows and for even more advanced ones  
3:28
that's why over 2.2 million companies use and  Trust zapia thanks to zapia for sponsoring this  
3:33
video now over here you can find the start area  in which you can find a narrow down list of the  
3:38
things that are most important to you and you can  even add a St item directly into the St list so if  
3:43
I want to go to I can create a list up here and  I can organize into what list it goes into add a  
3:49
more detailed description and even choose an all  day one which might be even more helpful and you  
3:53
can press save to make that possible now one of  the things that you can do is part of Google's uh  
3:59
work space experience is access these apps along  the right hand side and you can toggle between the  
4:03
lists that you've got part of create a new list if  you do wish and click into tasks as well as adding  
4:08
more detail to them which is very very helpful but  it can get even more helpful when you're inside  
4:13
of a Google Document for example if you create  even a checkbox inside a Google doc if I create  
4:19
a checkbox very simply like that and add a task  like event details then this will assign as a task  
4:25
appears on the left hand side and I can go into it  and type in my name and add a date and even press  
4:31
assign as a task this is really good because it's  created a task for me and I can go over to here  
4:37
and find the relevant task in my relevant list  I've created it also attaches the documents and  
4:43
details to it which makes it a bit more accurate  in terms of finding the location of the context  
4:48
if you're working on Project now this doesn't end  here you can assign stuff to work colleagues as  
4:52
well if you're working with other people you can  assign stuff to them as well which means it'll  
4:56
appear inside of their natural Google tasks as  well you need to make sure you share permission  
5:02
to that document in particular with the other  person if you're assigning tasks and you can't  
5:06
do that inside a Google app separately but that's  how they appear you're able to see the assigned  
5:10
tasks and you can complete them and naturally  they'll be updated on this right hand side which  
5:15
is nice so that's how you get the Google Documents  integration going with this application the other  
5:19
thing you can do is use Gmail so here's an email  that I've got inside of my inbox one thing I can  
5:24
do is drag an email into my task area and it will  correlate the email that is just been Dragged In  
5:30
directly into Google Tasks which means I can check  find the best coffee here and now that is a task  
5:36
and if I press into it it instantly back dates it  and finds it and then I can still add details to  
5:42
it for example organizing it into an area so  if it's now in the to-do area and I can even  
5:47
add details like what day I want to complete  it on and things like that so being able to  
5:52
drag emails in is a massive benefit for those who  struggle with inbox overwhelm and use Gmail every  
5:59
single day today so one of the final superpowers  that Google Tasks offer is the ability to create  
6:04
subtasks and you can create subtasks by pressing  add a subtask and you can also be able to add  
6:09
more detail if you press enter you can continue  this and start writing some more so now this item  
6:15
has subtask as part of it this is perfect for  checklist or holiday items accordingly so one  
6:20
of the final tricks of Our Sleeve is being able to  use Google Tasks and time block them or see them  
6:25
inside of your Google account and that's calendar  of course so if I go over here and press this you  
6:30
can see that one of my items I created earlier  and assigned it to another email address which I  
6:34
own appears inside of the account which is very  helpful but you can see here this is my actual  
6:40
access and you need to make sure you activate  that and now you can see all of the tasks that you  
6:44
completed so one of the benefits is you can drag  stuff around and it will update accordingly in  
6:48
Google Tasks and you can even mark it as complete  without leaving the experience any routine stuff  
6:54
will appear on a routine basis which means it will  appear as an all day event daily and you can even  
6:58
set it to all day at 9:00 a.m. for example so for  those who like to see stuff in their calendar this  
7:03
is a great addition so that's everything about  Google Tasks it's a free simple to-do list app  
7:08
that it's going to help you do quite a lot of  things there's if you use Google workspace a lot  
7:12
of different ways you can use it with Gmail with  Google documents and Google Calendar to optimize  
7:17
your daily performance so those are all of the  ways that you can get started with Google Tas  
7:23

Don't forget to like and subscribe. Hi everyone. Welcome to our Google Gmail Fundamentals course.
Introduction
0:11
My name is Elissa Smith. Now this course is designed for anyone who is looking to maximize
0:17
the use of their Gmail account. Not only are we gonna show you how to create a Gmail account and also use it,
0:25
filter it, sort it, even label your Gmail. But we're also going to spend some time showing you other great features
0:31
that come with a Gmail account, like the chat feature, and your Google Calendar, and also your Google Contacts.
0:38
So please join us on this journey while we really learn to maximize your experience with Google Gmail.
Creating a Gmail Account
0:47
Hi everyone. In this lesson I wanna show you how to create your own Gmail account. So I'm gonna be using, uh, Google Chrome for this session because of course
0:56
that's what Gmail would like us to do. So I'm gonna come in and actually search for my Google site to
1:04
perform a search to find Gmail. Now that I'm at the Google search site, I can go ahead and come right
1:09
here and do a search for Gmail. This is going to either log me into an existing Gmail account, or it's going
1:16
to give me an option to actually go in and create a Gmail account of my own notice here in the middle, I can create a personal Gmail account, or I can
1:25
attribute a Gmail account to work also. Same options in the top right now. A little bit of background on what Gmail is, it's Google's free
1:33
web-based email hosting service. It was actually launched in 2004, invitation only, and
1:38
then made public in 2009. The thing you need to understand is that when you sign up for a Gmail account,
1:44
you're also getting a Google account, which is awesome because it gives you access to Google's online services like Google Docs, sheets, slides.
1:54
Calendar, Google meets along with additional tools. Now, a Google account also can sometimes be attributed to
2:01
what's called Google Workspace. Google Workspace is actually an online productivity and collaboration application
2:08
suite that Google also created. It actually started back in 2006. It was rebranded to the G Suite in 2016, and now in October
2:18
of 2020, it's officially been called the Google Workspace. This course is gonna focus, of course, on Gmail, but just know that sometimes
2:26
when you have Gmail, you may also have access to the Google Workspace, which gives you even more tools, especially if you're using Gmail as a tool for work.
2:35
For email at work. Now, what I'm gonna do is come right here to create account, and it's going to take
2:41
me to where I need to provide a name. This won't necessarily be my Gmail name because remember, there are
2:48
2 billion Gmail users, so many of these names have been used up. Notice it makes suggestions for you.
2:56
What I would suggest here is continue trying different combinations until
3:01
you find one that will work, and sometimes it takes a few tries. Once you do, you'll see that there's no red involved down here.
3:10
You need to provide a password. Remember that these passwords are going to be case sensitive and they are
3:17
encrypted, so don't lose your password. The next screen is gonna ask you for information for a recovery email, your
3:25
birthday, your gender, and after that your Gmail account's going to be created.
3:30
Stay with me and come to the next lesson so we can actually start learning to use our email.
Logging In and Navigating
3:39
Hi everyone. We're ready to log into my Gmail account. So what I'm gonna do is come into my Chrome browser, type
3:46
in Gmail, up in my URL bar. This will take you to your login screen for your Gmail account.
3:53
Now that the account's been created, I can get into it. So I'm gonna come here to the top right hand corner, click on sign
3:59
in, and then of course I'll type in my Gmail address that I created.
4:06
And then my password. Remember, the passwords are encrypted, they're case sensitive, and don't give
4:12
them out to anyone because you don't want them to have access to your Gmail. Once I'm in my Gmail account.
4:20
Let's take a minute and look at how easy it is to navigate in this area. So a couple of important features in the Gmail interface on the top left hand
4:29
side, below the back button, and the U R L bar of whatever browser you're using.
4:34
Because remember, you can use Gmail with just about any browser. So Edge, Firefox, Chrome, safari.
4:41
We're using Chrome because of course this is a Google tool, but right here you're gonna see that it shows me I'm in Gmail.
4:48
And then to the left of that, I have a main menu button. It looks like three horizontal lines.
4:55
This is giving me access to the different areas of my Gmail. I can actually, uh, collapse this menu down by clicking on the three
5:03
horizontal lines, or click on it again to make it full size later on. We're going to explore this menu, but basically what you're seeing are the
5:10
different areas of your Gmail where you can store your email content. Now in the top right hand corner, we're also going to see some additional tools
5:19
to help me manage my Gmail account. In the very top right, I will see the initial of the account name.
5:25
When I click on this, it shows me the account I'm logged into. Some people have multiple Gmail accounts, so it's nice to make
5:32
sure you're in the correct one. There's also an option here to take you back to the original personalizations
5:38
that you made to your Gmail account. So if you click here on manage your Google account, because remember your
5:44
Gmail is part of your Google account, it will open up a separate browser tab where you can go back and make changes to your Google account itself.
5:53
We're gonna close that and go back to the Gmail back in the original again tab, representing my Gmail account.
6:00
In addition to, again, the button letting me access my Google account, I'm also going to see right here, a little tile that allows me to get to the other apps
6:09
that are part of my Google account. This is going to include things like Google Meet the calendar tool and even
6:16
Google Drive, which we do have classes on. By the way, to the left hand side of that, you're going to see the settings
6:23
gear, and this is where you can go in and really customize how your Gmail account looks, which is something that we will do in just a few minutes.
Composing and Reading Messages
6:34
Hi everyone. Welcome back. I'm actually ready to start reading some of my Gmail and also create
6:39
my first email message and send it from my new Gmail account. So right now I'm in my Gmail account.
6:45
You can see that I've actually started to receive some income messages. I'm gonna close this for right now so we can just focus on how to.
6:53
Open up a message that's come into my Gmail inbox. One of the easiest ways is to go to the message.
7:00
When it's in bold, it means it hasn't yet been read or you haven't yet clicked on it. When it's not bold, that means that you've already focused on it.
7:08
So I'm just gonna double click on the message and you'll notice that with a single click or a double click, the message will open.
7:14
This is gonna show me some important information. The top shows me who the message is from, including their email address,
7:21
then the actual text or content of the email or Gmail in this case. And then I can read down and at the bottom it even provides me
7:29
with reply and forward options. But right now we're just focusing on how to read the incoming mail.
7:35
Now, to go back to my inbox, I have a couple of different options. One of them is this back button at the top left corner of the message.
7:43
I could also come in after I've opened a message up and click over here in the navigation pane on my inbox, and that would just close the message
7:51
and take me back to my inbox list. Now, how do you create a new Gmail that you're going to send to someone?
7:58
Well, in the top left corner there is a pose button you can also do on your keyboard.
8:03
Keyboard shortcuts. But for this one, we're gonna use the pose button and it opens up a new.
8:08
Message box. Now, in the top right hand corner, you're gonna see that you have minimized full screen and close buttons.
8:15
I'm gonna go ahead and go into full screen mode just so that we can focus on this new message box.
8:20
The first thing I see is that my cursor is blinking in the two field. So I'm gonna go ahead and type in the two.
8:26
Notice right here in the top right hand corner, you also have a CC for carbon copy or a bcc, which stands for blind Carbon copy.
8:35
Blind carbon copy would allow you to send that email message to someone. But everyone else that the message is being sent to would not see
8:43
that person's name as one of the recipients of the email. Subject line is, of course, what the message is about,
8:52
and it's good email ethics to always send some sort of a subject line with your message.
8:59
And then I'm typing in the body of my email at this point.
9:15
Now notice at the very bottom of the message, I also have a formatting toolbar,
9:21
and then in addition, tools help me add extra information to the message. But when I'm ready to send it off, I'm just gonna click on the send button and
9:30
the message will be sent through the internet to that person's email account. It doesn't have to be a Gmail account.
9:36
That's the beauty of Gmail. It works great with all other email applications. So we've just sent our first message.
9:44
Come to the next lesson because we're going to look at how you can send messages with attachments and also do forwards and replies.
Customizing Gmail with Quick Settings
9:53
Hi everybody. We're ready to customize our Gmail account with a tool called Quick Settings.
9:59
To get to your quick settings, you wanna go to the top right hand corner and look for the cog with a black border.
10:05
This is the Settings button, and really it's where you make your customizations to how your Gmail works and how it looks.
10:12
When I click right here, you'll see that the top section allows me to deal with the chat and meet features of my Google account, which I'm
10:19
not quite ready for yet, but I am gonna come down and look at Density. This is how much space is between each of the messages.
10:27
You'll see here there's a choice to do Compact makes the messages have a lot less space between them.
10:33
I'm gonna keep mine comfortable so I have a little extra room. There are also some really fun themes that you can apply to your Gmail account,
10:41
and just notice that you can even bring in your own photos here, or if you scroll down under themes, you can even go in and find images that are provided
10:49
by Microsoft and they actually become the background of your Gmail account.
10:54
Kind of make things look a little bit fun. Now. In addition to that, I can also come in and you'll notice that I
11:00
have different settings for how the incoming email is sorted. Now, the default is what I have right now, but I could also make it
11:08
so messages that have an important setting would be at the top, or unread messages would always be at the top.
11:15
I also have an option to create a priority inbox or even have multiple inboxes.
11:21
This is nice if you have maybe multiple emails that are coming into your Gmail account. I'm gonna go ahead and keep mine with the default.
11:29
Now, one of the things I really like in here that you can also apply is a reading pane. Many different email applications, user reading Paine, but you'll see
11:38
right here that I can have my reading pane appear on the right hand side. You'll notice how it reloads.
11:44
This allows me when my reading pain is open to actually see the message. On the right, there's a divider bar between that I can drag
11:51
to the right or to the left. And this reading pane also, if you go up to the top and come down to the reading
11:57
pane can be placed at the bottom as well. For right now, I'm gonna keep mine turned off.
12:02
The final option you'll have in here is the ability to see your messages in a conversation view.
12:07
This is great when you have email threads and an email thread is where a message has been responded to and forwarded multiple times.
12:14
So there are multiple emails in involved in the thread, and you'll see that by default, the conversation view is turned on.
12:20
I highly recommend it. So again, remember that the quick settings really allow you to make customizations
12:27
to your Gmail so it's more comfortable for you to use the way you would like.
Replying and Forwarding to Messages
12:33
Hey everybody. Welcome back. I'm ready to show you how to reply and forward when you're working in your Gmail.
12:40
Very basic concepts when dealing with email, but you need to know where the buttons are. So the first thing I need to do is select the message that I
12:48
would like to reply or forward. So I'm gonna come in and just click on the message. It will open up.
12:53
Now, there are multiple ways to reply and forward. The first options are down here on the bottom you'll see a reply
13:00
button and a forward button. Now what's the difference? Reply means I wanna send this message back with an additional message to
13:06
the person that's sent it to me. There's also a reply button up in the top right where you see the person's
13:13
email address that the message came from. If you come to the right hand side, you'll see a reply button there as
13:18
well, and the reply button usually points to the left when you're facing your computer to indicate that you're sending the message back.
13:26
So let's start with a reply. When I click on a reply, what's interesting about Gmail is the
13:31
reply actually opens up at the bottom so I can see the previous message and then I can respond.
13:48
The other thing that we're seeing happen as I do this is some of the auto complete that's built into the Google platform.
13:53
When it's trying to assume what I'm gonna type, it can help save time. I need to finish my my reply by clicking on the send button.
14:00
Now another option, and I'm gonna go back to my inbox, is to forward a message.
14:06
When I forward a message, I will be sending it to another person. So what I need to do is open the message up, and again, I'll see
14:13
forward buttons down on the bottom. Or again, if I go up to the top of the message and go to the right of
14:20
the email sender's email address, I'll see a vertical ellipses. And if I click here, there's also a forward option here.
14:28
Notice forward usually has a right facing arrow when you're looking at your computer to indicate that the message will be sent to another party.
14:35
It's always important to remember when you're forwarding messages, you only want to forward content that other people should have access to.
14:42
It's sometimes it's easy to forward something that you shouldn't send to someone else.
14:52
And of course, always remember to click on the send button after you forward or reply, just so that the message actually gets sent.
15:00
All right, in the next lesson we're gonna look at how to manage and delete messages. So make sure you come back.
Deleting and Recovering Deleted Items
15:09
Hey everybody. I'm ready to manage some of the content in my inbox. Managing your content is important because as more Gmail comes into
15:17
your account, if you're not keeping it organized, it will take over. One of the important things to do is not to be afraid to delete
15:24
content when you no longer need it. There are a couple of options. One of them is if the message is open.
15:31
At the top of the message, you'll see a toolbar that includes buttons that allow you to, for example, archive the message or even put it in your spam folder.
15:41
But finally, the trash can. This means to move the message to your deleted items folder,
15:46
which is what I wanna do. I just click on the trash can and the message will be removed from my inbox.
15:52
Another option, before I even open a message up is if I see a message that I don't need to spend time on, I can place it directly in my deleted items folder.
16:02
All I need to do is select it on the left hand side by filling in this checkbox, and
16:07
then I can again come up here and click on the trash can, and that will also move the message into my deleted items folder.
16:14
Now, how do you get to those items if you've deleted them? Over here on the left hand side, again in the navigation pane,
16:21
I'm gonna come down to more. This allows me to expand the full menu out so that I can see the additional areas that are part of my inbox, and if I come down towards
16:30
the bottom, I will see the trash. Anything that you place in your deleted items, folder or trash as we
16:36
like to call it, will end up here. Now notice it tells me right here at the top that messages in the
16:43
trash will be here for 30 days and then they're automatically deleted. So don't use this as a fail.
16:49
Save for saving things you're not sure that you wanna get rid of. If it's here, you've got 30 days and then it will be gone.
16:56
If I see something here that I would like to put back in my inbox, I can come here and select it.
17:02
There are multiple options to do this, but one of them that I like is to right click on the message.
17:08
If you're on a pc, when you write click, you'll have an option that says Move to inbox.
17:14
This will take the message and move it to my inbox where it was before I deleted it.
17:20
To permanently delete something, you select the message, and then again, up here you'll have a delete forever.
17:26
This will overrule the 30 day retention policy that's normally in place for the trash can and permanently delete the message.
17:34
Just remember that cleaning up is important, and the more you keep track of the content here and spend a little bit of time each day curating
17:41
your Gmail, the less time you'll spend looking for things and wishing that you'd never created a Gmail account.
17:47
So it's an important habit to get into.
Printing and Finding Help
17:53
Hey everybody. I need to be able to print one of my Gmail messages and also get help.
17:59
So to start with, how do I print one of these messages? Well, first of all, I need to go to the message and click on it so that it's open.
18:06
Then I'm gonna go to the top right corner of the message, not my Gmail, but the message directly above the reply button.
18:14
I'll see a small printer. This is one of the options that will take me into a print preview
18:20
of the message that I have selected. Now, on the right, I'll see the options for how it's going to print, including
18:26
the ability to print different pages and even update the layout of the message.
18:32
Oh, Whether it prints in black or white. And then at the bottom I have my print button and this will print it off. Keep in mind, I can also actually save my message as a PDF from here.
18:41
This is a great way to get my message into a different format, either on paper or something that could be opened in a Adobe Acrobat, for example.
18:50
Now, what about getting help? And when I did go to the print, you'll notice that it opened my message in a separate browser tab.
18:56
All I need to do is come in and close that browser tab. It'll take me back to my inbox. Now, from anywhere in your inbox, there is an option to
19:04
access the help portion of Gmail. If you go to the top right hand corner next to the settings cog, you're gonna
19:11
see a circle with a question mark in it. This will take you to the Gmail support when you click on it, it's a
19:17
dropdown menu, and if you just want to go in and look up help within a small database, you can go to the help option.
19:24
This will actually take you into a little. Task pain. There are going to be popular resources for the help at the top,
19:32
and then down towards the middle, there's actually a search tool. So right here, if I type in the type of topic that I'm looking for,
19:40
like how do I preview my emails? When I click on this again, result that it brings back, it will take me in and show
19:47
me the different steps required to open up a reading pane, for example, so that I can preview my incoming email when I'm done.
19:54
All I need to do to close the help task pane is just click on it and it will close again. The more you use it, the easier it gets.
20:02
There's also nothing wrong with going into Google and just googling the question that you have, but just remember, be careful about what sites you go to.
20:11
If you're using the Built-in search tool, you'll know that you're always getting good Google based information back.
New Message Options and Formatting
20:20
Hi everyone. In this lesson I wanna do two things. I wanna format a new message in my Gmail.
20:26
I also wanna look at some of the settings I can control with new Gmail messages.
20:31
So I'm gonna come over and go to the compose button. You'll notice that my navigation toolbar was minimized, but when I
20:36
hover over compose, it opens up. This will take me to a new message. Now, an interesting thing about the new message box is when
20:44
it opens, it's quite small. We've already talked about the minimize full screen and close buttons, but
20:51
full screen gives you a lot more room to see this new message box. At the bottom of the new message box, you're gonna see two important items.
20:59
One of them is the formatting toolbar that we'll talk about in just a minute. The second one is on the bottom, and this contains the send button and
21:07
other important options, including the capital letter A, that allows you to open and close that formatting toolbar.
21:15
Now, on the far right hand side of this toolbar is a vertical ellipses,
21:20
and if you haven't figured this out yet, in most applications, the ellipses button now represents an opportunity for more options.
21:29
A couple of important things you'll see in this menu include a spell check, another option for printing a new message, and at the very top, You can
21:38
set up so that new messages will always default to open in this full screen view.
21:44
Once you left, click on that default to full screen. You'll see a check mark next to it, and it means the next time I
21:50
come in and open up a new message, it always defaults to full screen. I like this because it gives me more room to type.
21:58
Now I'm gonna go ahead and enter the name of the person I'm sending my email message to. Another nice thing that, again, Gmail's good at is remembering email
22:07
addresses that you've already put in so you don't have to type them in. Again, if you need to do a cc, remember that's on the right
22:14
hand side for carbon copy. And then of course, always remember your subject lines.
22:19
Right. Now if I type this in, I'm gonna do a little bit of formatting.
22:29
I wanna include some formatting and a bullet to the list.
22:36
Now for that, I'm gonna come down, make sure that my formatting toolbar is open.
22:41
We'll see in the middle right that there is a bullet to the list.
22:51
And of course, this is going to allow me to just type in my bullets one at a time. You do this just like you would in Microsoft Word or
22:58
PowerPoint or Google Docs.
23:18
Now the other thing I want to do is add a little bit of formatting. So for this, I'm gonna go ahead and highlight my text.
23:26
Come down. You'll see that on the formatting toolbar I have bold button. If I really want to make something poke out, I can always
23:33
highlight it and then come down. For color, I have a letter A with a line under it.
23:38
This does two things. It allows me to do text color, or I could also do background color.
23:44
Background color is gonna be like a highlight behind the text. It can take a little bit of time for it to apply, but again, you
23:51
can see how it's like a highlighter that I've applied behind. If I see any spell check issues, you'll see it get underlined.
23:58
I can right click and get again, a spell check correction. So formatting is really easy to use.
24:03
If you'd like to update with, for example, a different font style, you'll see next to the undo button and redo button.
24:10
You do have a few font choices. It's a little bit more limited, but also you can increase font sizes as well.
24:17
So there are some opportunities to update formatting to make your email message look a little bit more exciting.
24:23
Then I'm gonna send it off. Try this out in your own email account. Go in, open up a new email message.
24:29
You can even send it to yourself, but practice using some of those formatting options just so you can see how they compare with maybe
24:37
other applications that you've used. Hi everybody. Welcome back.
Sending Attachments
24:42
I'm ready to send message with a file. So I'm gonna come up, open up my new message, of course, address it
24:50
and include a subject line and then the actual text of the message.
25:00
Now the important thing when you send an attachment is to be sure you know where the attachment is stored.
25:06
This attachment is stored locally on my computer's hard drive, so I'm gonna come down to the bottom of my new Gmail message right next to the send button.
25:14
I'll see a paperclip. Now, most email applications that we use represent attach files with the
25:21
paperclip, so it's pretty easy to locate. When I click on it. I'm going to navigate to where the file is located on my computer or on a network
25:29
drive, select it and then click on open. It will copy the attachment into my Gmail message.
25:37
You can see it added down here at the bottom. Now remember that when you send an attachment, you are giving
25:42
someone access to a file. A copy of that file will be sent to the recipient of this email.
25:48
So it's always important to only send email attachments and information that that person has permission to access because they'll now have a
25:56
copy of this file that I'm sending. I'd love to have you try this out. So open up your own Gmail and send a message to someone with an attachment,
26:05
and then make sure it's someone trust and how easy it send attachments.
26:14
Hi everybody. We are ready to send a link through Gmail. This is another great way to communicate information that may be
Sending Links
26:20
outside your Gmail, like a document that's linked or also a website.
26:25
I'm gonna go up and compose my new message and again, address it to the person I'm sending it to include a subject line.
26:34
Now, one thing that I've done ahead of time that can be helpful is I've already gone in and opened up the website that I wanna create the link to.
26:42
You can see it right here. It's actually the Gmail help website, but I want to include
26:47
it in a message to a coworker. I have my text right here. Now to include the actual link to the site, I'm gonna come down to the bottom
26:56
of my new message and come over to about the fourth button over from the left, which is the insert link button.
27:04
Notice it looks a little bit different than the paperclip that you use to attach files because here we're going to be including a link to a site or
27:12
a file, not an actual attachment. I'm gonna click on the button and you'll see that it opens
27:18
up this box called edit link. Now I have two options. I can either link to an A website address.
27:24
This would be a u RL or an email. In this case, I want to go to a url, but I need to include texts.
27:31
That will actually be the link, so I'm gonna go ahead and just type that in. And then right here, I need to paste in the website address.
27:40
So if you already have the browser tab open for the website you want to go to, you can actually open it up, go to the URL bar, click on it
27:49
to highlight, or you could left drag and control C, or if you're on an
27:54
Apple computer command C, right? To copy that. Then I'm gonna jump back to my Gmail tab and I will come down and
28:02
control V or paste that link in. Then I'll click on, okay, and I'll see it right here.
28:11
Now, how does this link actually work? When you come to the link, you'll notice that until you send the message,
28:16
you can't actually use the link, but if you right click on it, there will be an option that you can use that will say, open this link in a new tab.
28:24
This would allow you to just check the link to see that it's working. And here I can see that it's opened, so it is working correctly, and
28:31
I'm gonna send the message off. So anyone who receives that message will get a hyperlink that they can click on,
28:39
that will then take them to that site. It's a great way to share information quickly and easily, and it doesn't require
28:46
you to put the entire website address in. You provide them with that hypertext link that will actually do it for them.
28:53
Go ahead and try it out. Pick your favorite website and try linking it and even emailing it or
28:59
gmailing it to yourself or to a coworker. It's a great way to share information through.
29:06
Hi everyone. I'm ready to attach a file to a Gmail message that's stored in my Google Drive account.
Inserting Files from Google Drive
29:13
This is one of the things I love about Gmail is that it comes with additional tools that really help to optimize your experience when you're
29:20
trying to communicate through Gmail. And one of them is that you can actually add files as attachments that are
29:26
stored in your Google Drive, which, if you remember, is cloud storage. Now, to do this, of course, we need open up another new message.
29:34
I'm going to address it, the person
29:41
now
29:49
down below, when I get ready to find the file, remember it's saved to my Google Drive.
29:55
So rather than going to the attachment button, I'm gonna come to the middle of the toolbar, next to the button and look for this triangle button.
30:04
When I hover over it, you'll notice that it tells me insert files using drive, which they mean Google Drive.
30:11
This is cloud storage. When I click on it, it's going to show me the different files that are stored on my drive.
30:18
You'll also see other options like files that have been shared with me by a coworker or someone else, recent files, or an opportunity to upload files.
30:28
In this case, the file I want is right here in my drive. I will select it. Now I have to make a choice.
30:34
This time I want to include it as a normal attachment, which means I select attachment, notice the paperclip, and then say, insert it, inserts it into
30:44
the message as a normal attachment, so it's being copied in the message.
30:49
Another option, I'm gonna go down to my insert using Google Drive again, is to select a file and actually add it as a linked file.
30:59
This means that I will be giving this person not a copy of my file, but an actual link, and I'll see the link right here at the top of the document.
31:18
So again, notice that the link file looks like a hyperlink, whereas the attachment looks like a traditional attachment, but they're both coming
31:27
from my Google Drive and Gmail gives me the opportunity to choose how. I will, again, share these files as an attachment or as a shared link.
31:36
When I'm done, I'm gonna click on send and it'll send that file off. Now you'll notice because I included the file as a link, it's
31:44
gonna ask me who gets access. Now at this point, anyone with this link would have the ability to view this file,
31:51
and that's fine, or I could not give access, and I'm gonna click on send.
31:56
So when you share the file with a link, the permission to access the file is an additional feature that you have to consider.
32:02
Now. Go in and try sharing a file from your Google Drive or attaching it.
32:08
It's a great way again, to make Gmail even more optimized.
Inserting Images into Messages
32:16
Hi everybody. I wanna be able to put an image in the actual text of my Gmail here.
32:22
Address, message, open ahead and type.
32:33
Now I want these images to actually appear within the body of my.
32:48
This is different than attaching them because if they're an attachment, then the attachment comes with the email.
32:53
You double click on it and it'll open in a photo viewing program, this will actually put the pictures in the body of the email.
33:00
So what I'm gonna do is come down to the bottom and actually look for the little image button that has mountains on it.
33:06
It's kinda small, but it's there. If you look for it, I'm gonna click on it. This is the insert photo button.
33:13
Now I can either have photos stored in my Google Drive or I can come to a website,
33:18
or if they're right here on my computer, I can select the files from my device. So I just need to highlight the pictures that I want to bring in.
33:26
Now it has to upload the pictures and actually add them to my new message. You can see them get added here.
33:33
They come in full size, and sometimes this means that they will be too big.
33:38
If I click on the image, you'll notice that there are sizing handles on the corners. Additionally, at the bottom, it gives me options to either change the size of the
33:48
image or even come in and add alternate texts for someone who might be visually impaired or even remove the image.
33:55
I can use these to help size the image better to fit into my email, or if I want to, I can manually click on the image at the corner and drag
34:04
it down and adjust it size manually. But this actually puts the image into the message.
34:10
Now remember that when you add images to your message, it will greatly increase their size, so it might be a good idea to make them smaller, just
34:19
so that your message isn't too vague. When I'm ready, I can send the message off and again, the person that receives
34:25
that Gmail message will be able to open it up and see those images inside of it. In fact, if I go to my sent items folder, I come right here
34:34
to the message I just sent. Double click on it and we'll see that the two messages are viewable right
34:39
within the actual content of the Gmail. It's a great way to quickly share something that's a
34:44
visual image that you want now. Try yourself a picture you've taken and message.
Sending Messages with Confidential Mode
34:57
Hi everybody. I'm concerned sometimes that when I send email messages or Gmail
35:02
messages, I'm not sure what happens to them after they get sent. We wanna talk about a thing called confidentiality mode.
35:10
In Gmail, you can send messages and attachments and turn on Gmail's confidentiality mode to help protect sensitive information
35:18
from unauthorized access. When you use confidential mode, basically what you can do is set
35:23
an expiration date for messages and revoke access at any time. Recipients of this confidential message will have options to
35:31
forward, copy, print, and download. Turned off. Now, how do you do this? Because it sounds pretty magic, doesn't it?
35:37
You're gonna come to the message. I have a new message here opened up that includes information that I want be confidential.
35:44
I don't want this content to be able to be forwarded to someone else. So on the bottom of the message, I'm gonna come down to the right hand side and
35:51
look for the padlock with a clock on it. This allows me to toggle on my confidential mode.
35:59
When I click on this, the confidential mode box opens up. You'll see things here that it will allow me to set an
36:04
expiration date on this message. Additionally, I can decide whether I'm going to include passwords and
36:12
if there is no SMS password or if there is an SMS passcode included.
36:18
Now, if I choose no SMS passcode recipients of this Gmail, I should say recipients using the Gmail app, will be able to open it directly.
36:27
If they don't have a Gmail, they will get an emailed passcode. If I choose to do an SMS passcode, recipients will get
36:35
a passcode by text message. We need to make sure that we enter the recipient's phone number, not your own.
36:41
If you do this, I'm gonna go ahead and just say, no SMS passcode, and click on save.
36:47
Now you'll see here this again little alarm comes up notification letting me know that whoever I've sent this message to will not be able to
36:54
forward copy, print or download the email, which is exactly what I want. Notice that the confidential mode button is highlighted and I'll click on send.
37:04
Again, this helps me to send messages with a piece of mind, knowing that the message
37:09
will stay confidential just between myself and the person I sent, and in this case, it expire after sending message
37:21
it. Hi everyone. I want to send a signature with my new Gmail messages.
Creating Email Signatures
37:30
For this, I need to access the settings gear of my Gmail account. So I'm going to go to the top right hand corner.
37:37
This will take me to the settings task pane. I need to go down to see all settings, especially when
37:43
you're using Gmail for work. It's important to include contact information, like cell phone numbers,
37:49
job titles, ways to get ahold of you that people can see in your messages. This is why signatures can be so crucial.
37:56
Now, from here, you're gonna see tabs at the top. You should be on the general tab, and then scroll down for quite
38:02
a while, almost to the bottom. On the left hand side, you'll see signatures.
38:09
Click Create new button. Give my new signature a name, and yes, you can have multiple
38:14
signatures in your Gmail account. Then in the box on the right, I'm going to paste in or type
38:20
in my signature information. This can include my name, my email address.
38:25
Now, if I would like to include formatting, I need to use the toolbar underneath to update, for example, the font style and the font size.
38:34
I can also include color if I want to apply text color. I'll come to the letter a button, find the text color that I want, and for
38:42
anything like bold or italics, I just again, need to use the formatting toolbar.
38:47
When I'm finished, I also need to make sure that I apply this new signature for new emails and replies and forwards the very bottom.
38:56
I'm going to save my changes. This is very critical because if you close that box without doing
39:02
the save changes, your new signature will not be available to you. Now to see the signature, I'm gonna compose a new message.
39:09
I'm going to address it and notice my new signature is here and it includes
39:14
the formatting that selected for. Now, let's say that I decide I don't wanna include this particular signature,
39:21
or I'd like to include a different one on the body of the new message. I'll see a toolbar that includes a pen.
39:28
This is the insert signature button. If I click on this, it would let me turn off the signature.
39:34
Or if I had additional signatures, they would show up in this list and I could pick them. When I'm ready, I'll send the message off and I set up my default so that
39:42
if I go in to forward a message or reply to a message, you'll notice
39:48
here that when I go in to do that,
39:54
it would still include my signature at the very bottom of whatever information I'm sending.
39:59
So again, signatures are a great way to really customize your experience and make sure that the people that you're sending messages to have a way to contact you.
40:08
Go into your own Gmail account and try setting up a signature of your own.
Spell Check and Spelling Options
40:15
Welcome back. It's time to talk about spell check. It's the thing we don't want to think about, but when it goes wrong, it's bad.
40:23
So I want to show you, first of all where your spell check settings in your Gmail account are located.
40:28
I'm gonna come up and go to the settings cog and click on it and of course open up.
40:34
See all settings. This way you can go into the in depth settings under the general tab.
40:40
I'm gonna scroll down about halfway and I'll see that there are kind of three important areas.
40:45
The first one is grammar. This is where it suggests good grammar in your Gmail, spelling
40:52
suggestions, and then auto correct. This is where if you make a common spelling error, it will
40:58
automatically fix it for you. If any of these bug you, you can turn them off.
41:03
But I like these settings. I'm gonna keep them exactly the way they are cuz I'm not changing anything.
41:08
I'm just gonna click on the inbox button and go back. Let's see, for example, that I am responding to a message.
41:15
Open the message up, come down and click on a reply. And then I'll of course get my text into the message.
41:22
Now, one place where you'll see spell check is when you make a spelling error, like you see the one here, which is on purpose by the way.
41:29
You can right click on it and you'll see spelling suggestions. If there's one that you want, you can click on it and it will fix it.
41:37
Another one that's really common is where you of course, will ask for a spelling
41:43
correction by doing a spell check. And for that you can turn on spell check yourself.
41:51
I'm gonna come down here to, again, the bottom of the message. Click on the vertical ellipses and go into check spelling.
41:59
This initiates a spell check. You can see here how it's highlighted. The word that I've misspelled.
42:04
I can right click on it and pick the correct spelling. Additionally, if I want to recheck, if I don't trust the spell check,
42:12
I can click right here and notice that next to the recheck button. On the bottom right hand corner of the message, you do have an arrow that
42:19
allows you to actually decide what language the spell check is being done. So English is not the only language that's supported by Gmail.
42:28
When I'm done, I can just click on the send button and my message has been spell checked and sent off.
42:34
So try it out in one of your messages just so you can feel solid with doing spell check, because it is important and we wanna make sure that our Gmail makes
42:42
us look smart and not the other option.
Vacation Responder
42:47
Howdy everybody. Let's set up an out of office reply or what's called a vacation responder
42:53
in Gmail, so that when we do get to go on vacation, our Gmail is going to be partially curated for us.
43:00
While we're gone, I'm going to come up to the settings cog in the top right hand corner and go into my defaults for my Gmail account.
43:08
We'll go down to see settings, and from this box, you wanna make sure that you're under the general tab and all the way at the bottom.
43:17
Now, of course, by default, the vacation responder is turned off. To turn it on, you need to place a dot and then include the date when
43:25
you want your vacation to begin. If you want to include a last day, you can do that using the calendar
43:32
or typing the date in Also a subject line, because this is going to be an email response to incoming messages.
43:40
Then down below, you can actually include the text of the message. Notice there's a toolbar here that you can use to have it formatted.
43:48
Now, it's important to understand how this works. It's gonna send an automatic reply when someone sends you a message.
43:55
If you have someone that sends you many messages, they're only gonna get one automatic reply every four days because we don't want them to get
44:02
that same reply over and over again. Also, this checkbox at the very bottom, would only send the response
44:10
to someone who's in your contacts. Sometimes we have a lot of junk mail that comes into our Gmail account, so
44:16
this would keep it from sending them a vacation response when I'm not around. It's also important to know that your vacation replies will start at 12:00
44:24
AM on the first day that you enter in here and end at 11:59 PM at the end
44:31
date, unless you wanna end it earlier. In most cases, your vacation response is only sent to people the first time
44:37
they message you, because as we already mentioned, it starts over every four days. Now, a couple of things also to keep in mind with this is that if you edit your
44:47
vacation response, it will send another one when someone emails you again.
44:52
So there is a chance they could get two if you set up the initial response and then do another one.
44:58
Now, when I'm done setting up my vacation response, it's important that I click on Save changes and again, notice that it will set up to end on whatever day I pick.
45:09
And then I'll know that it's turned on. And while I'm gone, I can know that people will know that I won't be
45:15
answering these messages immediately. So it's an important thing to do. It's also considered polite and it will save you a lot of time having to answer
45:23
emails that you didn't have time to deal with because you are on vacation. So try it out just so you can see where it is and be familiar with it.
45:30
And that way when you need to use it, you'll.
45:35
Hey everybody. One of my pet peeves about email is when I have to create the same email over and over again.
Creating Templates
45:42
There is a way around this in Gmail and it's called Creating a Template.
45:47
The template basically becomes a copy of that email message that you can reuse whenever you need to send it.
45:54
The first thing we need to do is turn templates on in our Gmail account. So we're gonna go up to the settings Cog in the top right hand corner.
46:02
You should be getting really good at that by now. Click on it and go to see all settings.
46:08
Now, this time we are going to go to a different tab. At the top of the settings box, you'll see that there are several different tabs.
46:16
Go over to the right, almost to the end and find advanced. Once you're here, you will see that down towards the middle there is a
46:25
template section in new Gmail accounts. It's turned off or disabled.
46:30
As you can see, we're going to enable this so that we can start creating template emails and we'll say save changes.
46:38
Now, once you're done doing that, you need to create one of the emails that you want to create into a template before the template can be made.
46:46
So I'm gonna go up to the compose button and open up my message and just get it ready.
46:57
The person I send it to is not as important as the text and the subject line.
47:03
And of course my signature's included because I have signatures turned on. Now, to make this email into a template, I'm going to come down to the bottom
47:11
and go to the vertical ellipses. More options. I'll now see a new opportunity here called templates, and what I want
47:20
to do is come into this menu and say, save draft as a new template.
47:27
I need to give my new template a name. It will default to give it the name of the subject line, which works great for me.
47:34
And I'll click on save. Now I can go ahead and send this message off. Another month goes by and it's time to recreate that same email.
47:43
I'm gonna go up to the pose button, but before I type anything in, I'm going to come down to the bottom of the new email message and go to the More options button.
47:54
Templates will be here. Any templates that you've created will show up under the insert template menu.
48:01
There's also a way to delete any templates you no longer need. I'm gonna select the template that I want.
48:08
It fills it out, but it does not include the recipients of the message. This is where I will need to type in the names of the people that
48:15
I need to send this message to. Once I do that, I can send it off.
48:20
The thing about templates is they'll save a lot of time and create consistencies in those redundant emails that you need to send every month or every
48:28
week, especially around work topics. So feel free to go in and try these out because they can be a big time saver.
Applying Labels
48:38
Welcome back everybody. I'm ready to show you a really great tool to help you organize your Gmail. It's called a label.
48:45
Now, in other email programs, you might have stored email in folders, but in Gmail you can use labels to categorize.
48:51
Your email. Labels are like folders, but they have a twist. You can apply several labels to an email.
48:57
Then later you can find it by clicking on any of its labels over in the navigation pane. You can also search by labels.
49:03
The great thing about these is that you are the one that's in control of them. So first of all, how do you apply a label to any of your messages?
49:11
I'm gonna come over here and just. Select the message. When I do this, I'll see above my inbox list a new toolbar populate.
49:20
On the far right hand side, I'm gonna see a white little ticket button. This is the label button.
49:26
When you click on it, you're gonna see that you can search for labels. There are also some prebuilt labels that are provided by Google, but down
49:33
at the bottom you can create a new label, which is what I'm gonna do. So I'm gonna select create new.
49:39
I'm gonna create some labels for projects that I work on. I type in the name and click on Create.
49:45
Now the label has been applied. I didn't get to pick the color or anything, but we can see in my inbox
49:51
how it's showing up right next to the name of the particular message. Now, let's say that I'd like to customize that label.
49:59
I have a few different options. If I come back up to the labels menu, I'll see that I can go down and manage labels.
50:06
This will actually take me into my settings list. So again, this is the settings that I can also access from the
50:12
cog in the top right hand corner. This will show me my current, again, availability of labels and any custom
50:19
labels show up down at the bottom. Now, to leave this menu, I'm just gonna click on my inbox again.
50:24
Another easier way to work with labels is to actually come over to the navigation pane.
50:30
Right under the more button, you'll see a label section with a plus sign next to the word labels.
50:36
If I click on this, this will automatically bring up the new label box, and from here I can just type in the name of the label I want, and
50:44
it will add it to my labels menu. Now, to customize any of these pre-built labels or labels that I've created,
50:51
I'm gonna come to the label, hover over it, and go to the ellipses. This will let me adjust the color of the label.
50:58
And you can add custom colors. By the way, if you look here, you'll see that there's an add custom color option.
51:05
A couple of other options that you're gonna see here, besides being able to actually customize the color of the label is you can also decide if the label will
51:14
show over here in this label's menu. If it's gonna show up in the message list. This is your inbox, or if you'd like to edit or remove the label.
51:23
Now, if you remove the label, this is like deleting it. Let's go ahead and set the label color on this message as well.
51:30
So now I have my M 800 and my M 900. And now if I want to apply the label to more than one message, I'm gonna
51:37
select multiple messages, come up to the labels button, click on it,
51:42
and I can just check off the label. I want to apply, and I'll notice that it gets applied to multiple messages.
51:48
So go into your Gmail and try creating some labels of your own.
Editing and Removing Labels
51:56
Hi everyone. Welcome back. We wanna spend a little bit more time managing labels and applying
52:01
them to our Gmail messages. Now in my inbox right now, I have three custom labels that I have created.
52:08
Also, look at the second message in my inbox, and you'll see that you can actually apply as many labels to a specific Gmail message as you'd like.
52:17
A really great way to do this on a PC is to go to the message that you'd like to apply the label to.
52:23
Right click on it, and fourth, from the bottom you'll see a label as option.
52:29
This is a great way to go because it actually shows you the labels you currently have created.
52:35
You can check off the labels that you'd like to apply. Make sure you click on the apply button at the bottom.
52:42
Checking the box off will not actually apply the label until you click on apply.
52:47
Now, if any of these labels get edited, it will edit them on all the conversations
52:52
or Gmail emails they've been applied to. For example, I'm gonna come to my M 700 label.
52:58
I'm gonna go up to the ellipses next to it and update its label color. When I do this notice, it's updated everywhere where it's been used.
53:06
Another great thing about the labels is that if you want to use them to filter the email in your inbox, The labels are one of the fastest ways to do it.
53:16
If I come over here and click on any of the labels, it actually filters for just the messages that have that label applied to them.
53:24
So it's a great way for me to be able to find specific messages without having to put them in folders.
53:29
If I want to go to an unfiltered list, I can either come up to the search bar and click on the X next to the showing filter, or I can come over
53:37
and just click on my inbox again, and it will turn the filter off. Now finally, what if I delete one of these labels?
53:44
Will it delete the emails or the Gmails associated with that label? I'm gonna come to my M 800 label, go to the ellipses and
53:53
come down and say, remove label. This is the same as deleting it. When I remove a label, it will tell me it's removing it from two conversations.
54:02
That would be, again, two items in my inbox and the label will be deleted. But deleting a label will never actually delete the Gmail messages
54:10
associated with that label. So again, labels are an excellent way to filter for content and allow you
54:16
to categorize your Gmail content with categories that are your very own. So try out making some of your own labels and then organizing your Gmail with them.
Applying Stars and Important Markers
54:30
Hi everyone. We need to talk about two important markers in your navigation pain that cause a lot of confusion.
54:37
If you look over here in my Google account, you'll see that I have a starred option, and then there's also one called important.
54:45
Then I'm gonna show you how to turn on in just a moment. Now, why are these both here? Because when I see a star, it makes me think I need to pay attention to it.
54:53
The star marker is an alternative method for you to basically mark messages as being important to you.
55:00
You can flag them yourself. Now, important is different because it is actually designed by Gmail
55:08
to mark is important for you. It's something that's automatically done and it is a label.
55:14
Gmail uses an algorithm and watches what you do. Now, you can also manually mark messages as important, but Gmail learns
55:21
as it goes with the important label. Now, if I don't see both in this list, how can I turn them both on?
55:27
We're gonna come right here to the navigation pane, make sure it's all the way open and go down to more.
55:34
When I come down, I'll see that important is here. If for some reason it isn't, go down to where you see
55:40
managed labels under the trash. And come into the settings area and the labels tab.
55:47
What you wanna do is make sure that anything you want to be able to see clearly is basically marked as show, which means it will show up in the
55:56
menu over here, and all you need to do when you're done making those changes, it's just click back on the inbox and it will show your email again.
56:04
Now I see starred and I see important now to apply, for example, a starred email, which is meaning I am manually marking it as important.
56:13
All I need to do is come over here and I'll see a star next to the select message option.
56:19
I click on this and it fills it in. Now remember that with important, it will automatically apply that, but if
56:26
it doesn't, if a message is important to me and Gmail has skipped it, I can actually come right here to this little icon that's to the right hand side of the
56:35
star, and this will mark it as important. And notice that when it has an important or a starred status, you'll actually see
56:42
the marker fill in with a different color. Now, what's the use of this? Let's say later on I need to see all of my starred marker emails.
56:51
I'm gonna come right here to Stard and click on it in the navigation pane. Any messages that have the star applied to them will be filtered.
56:59
Also, notice up in my search bar it will say is colon stard. Now if I wanna see any of the important messages that either I
57:08
or Gmail have marked for me, I can come down and click on important. But remember, with the important status, this is something that Gmail
57:16
will actually do for you automatically. Now, to turn one of those settings off, I'm gonna return back to my inbox list.
57:23
All I have to do to unstar something is just click on the star and all I have to do to un important something is click on it and it will remove
57:30
that option from the message. But these two markers are available for you to use as you want inside of Gmail,
57:38
and don't be afraid to try them out because they're really easy to apply.
Scheduling Messages
57:46
Hi. I need to make sure that before this message is sent, I can schedule when it will actually be sent.
57:52
Cause by default, as soon as I click on the send button at the bottom of this new message, it's going to go out to that person that it's addressed to.
58:00
What I'm going to do to schedule the send is come to the arrow next to the send button.
58:05
This is magic. When you click on it, it will allow you to schedule when the message will actually be sent out.
58:11
I'm gonna schedule this message to actually be sent on Monday morning Notice. I could also actually come in and pick a date and time that I want just by typing
58:20
it into the box and saying, schedule send. Now, how can I see messages that have been scheduled after I've been set them up?
58:28
After I've set them up over in the navigation pane, make sure it's all the way expanded.
58:34
There is a section for scheduled messages. When you click on this, it will show you any of your messages that are scheduled
58:42
to be sent out at a specific time. Not only that, it will show you the time of day or the date when they're scheduled.
58:48
Now, if you actually come in and click on the message, it will open it up and notice that you have the opportunity to cancel having that message sent at that time.
58:58
It doesn't actually delete the message though. It opens it back up and allows you to come back down and reschedule
59:05
when you want the message to be sent. And so I'm gonna go ahead and just say, Hey, let's send it tomorrow.
59:10
And as long as the messages stay in this menu, they will be sent out at their established date and time, and you don't have to worry about them.
59:17
It's really great because it gives you more control over when something is actually received by the person you're sending it to.
59:24
Go into your own email and try it out.
Snoozing Messages
59:29
Hi, have you ever had a really long week and you get that email that you just don't wanna deal with?
59:35
Well, first of all, I'm gonna open that email up. Here's the email. Notice it has a couple of attachments in it.
59:41
Remember, with attachments, you can easily come underneath and download. Or even have those attachments added to your Google Drive account, or you can even
59:50
go in and edit them using Google Slides. You can see that this will depend on the type of file. This is a PowerPoint, so that's why I get the edit with Google Slides.
59:58
But even if I just want to preview the particular attachment, I can click on it and it will preview for me so I can look at it, and then if I click on the back
1:00:06
arrow, it takes me back to the message. Now, I definitely know I can't deal with this right now, so I want to
1:00:12
use this snooze feature in Gmail. What I'm gonna do is come to the top of the message where I see, again,
1:00:18
the toolbar for managing the message, and I'm gonna come into the middle. It's where I see the clock.
1:00:24
This is the snooze button. It takes this message and allows me to either pick a specific date
1:00:29
and time when I want to deal with this message, or I can pick one. I'm just gonna go ahead and say later today, and notice that I can
1:00:36
do this with multiple messages. Another option for snoozing is to right click on the message and you'll see
1:00:42
a snooze option in the menu as well. And again, I can pick either a specific date and time, like I can
1:00:49
say Monday, I wanna deal with this. Now, after a message has been snoozed, where can you go
1:00:54
to see your snoozed content? Over in the ma in the navigation pane, you'll see that same clock.
1:01:02
And when you click on it, you'll see any messages that you've snoozed. You'll also see the date and time when they've been marked to be,
1:01:10
again, put back into your inbox so that you pay attention to them. If you ever want to edit this, you can actually just go to the date and time
1:01:17
that's shown and the snooze button, and you can come in and say, UN snooze. It will remove the message from your snooze box and
1:01:25
put it back into your inbox. So snooze messages are a way to let something take a nap or snooze so
1:01:32
that you don't have to deal with it. Try this out. It's a great way to sometimes delay stress.
Search and Advanced Search
1:01:42
Hey everybody. There's nothing worse than not being able to find a message that you need to in
1:01:47
your Gmail box, so it's great to remember that the search mail at the top is a very
1:01:53
powerful tool for searching and filtering. Let's start with just a simple keyword search.
1:01:58
I can click here, type in the name of the person that I want to find all content from.
1:02:03
Now notice as I do this, it actually instinctually gives me option. Does the message have an attachment?
1:02:10
Was it sent in the last seven days? Was it from me? I'm gonna go ahead and say, has attachment, and then I'm going to
1:02:17
hit the enter key on my computer. This will go through and find any messages that included Diego.
1:02:22
Notice how his name is also included and have attachments. Remember, it's both.
1:02:28
To clear the search, I'm gonna click on the X. Now, if you really want a powerful way to make sure your searches are
1:02:34
successful, before you type in your keywords, come to the right hand side and look at search options.
1:02:41
These allow you to specify if it's a specific message from a person, and as I type in a person's name, it will actually select them from my contacts if
1:02:50
there's a specific two or subject line. If it has a specific size, a specific date, and when I'm ready, I can click on
1:02:58
search and notice it found exactly the message that I was looking for, and now I can double click on it and open it up.
1:03:04
Now you can also use key words when you perform a search. So if I come in here and I type the word from and then a colon, I can
1:03:12
actually say who the message was from. And I'll say, for example, Megan in this case. And notice that even selects her name and I can say has an attachment.
1:03:22
And then I can hit the enter key to perform the search. And again, it's found the message that I'm looking for.
1:03:28
If I need to refine my search even more, there's an advanced search option that takes me back to the pain where I could go ahead and actually
1:03:35
add more detail to the search. And again, when I'm done, I'm just gonna click on the X and go back to my inbox to clear the search out.
1:03:42
Search, try searching on your own. Because what I find is the more you do searches, the more comfortable you're going to get with how Gmail goes about them.
Saving Filters
1:03:53
Hi everyone. Now we need to talk about filtering and sorting your inbox.
1:03:59
Now to start with filters we've already used, we applied labels previously in the course.
1:04:05
And remember, once a label has been applied to a message, you can come to the navigation pane, click on the label, and the label will filter your inbox
1:04:14
by the messages it's been applied to. We also explored some of the built-in labels that service filters that
1:04:21
are part of the Gmail platform, the stard label that you can apply. The Snoozed label, the important label and the scheduled label.
1:04:31
These are all built-in labels that you can apply to messages that allow you to understand different things about them.
1:04:38
But what if you want a filter that will be saved and do something for you? In this case, we're going to go up to the search bar and to the right
1:04:46
hand side to the search options or the advanced search options. From here, I'm going to type in the criteria.
1:04:53
Anytime a message comes from a specific person, I want to create a filter that I can use.
1:05:01
I'm going to click on Create Filter, but this filter will actually do something for me what I'd like it to do, and notice some of the different options.
1:05:10
I can archive the message, automatically star it or apply a label, and
1:05:17
then I'll click on Create Filter. So whenever a message matches that criteria, so in this case a message
1:05:25
from that person, then I would like that particular filter and in this case, rule to be applied to it.
1:05:32
Now, how do I edit or get rid of those filters? I'm gonna need to go back to my Gmail settings, and this time I'm actually going
1:05:40
to come to all settings and go to the filters and blocked addresses tab in here.
1:05:47
Any filters that I have created for incoming messages will show up in this list.
1:05:52
I can check off and notice there's an edit option. That would take me back in to edit the filter, or there's also going to be,
1:06:00
when I'm in there, I'm gonna go back in really quick, an option to delete the
1:06:06
filter so that it will no longer run. So not only is this a filter, it's also something that will
1:06:12
perform a task for me in my inbox. So I also like to call these rules because they filter,
1:06:19
but they also apply something. In this case, it was a label that was being applied to that message.
1:06:25
Feel free to play with these, but remember, they can impact the content of your inbox, so use them carefully.
1:06:35
Hi. It's not uncommon to want to apply filter to messages that are already in your inbox.
Applying Filters
1:06:40
So what I'm gonna do is select the message and come up to the, again, toolbar at the top, and go to the more options or vertical ellipses button.
1:06:49
Here I'm gonna select filter messages like these. Now it already knows, this message is from, again, this particular coworker.
1:06:57
I could include additional criteria, but I'm gonna select Create Filter. And then again, I'm going to select what I want it to do.
1:07:06
Apply a label, delete the message, mark it as important, and then I'll click on Create Filter.
1:07:11
What I'll notice is that it will actually apply that, and again, that filter will be running in my inbox, and you can see down here it
1:07:18
even tells me I've created a filter. So you can go back into settings and edit those filters after you've created them.
Blocking Senders and Spam
1:07:29
Hi everybody. What about all those emails you get that you don't want? You have some options.
1:07:35
I'm gonna go back to my inbox. Let's say something that looks suspicious. You can actually block the message and report it as spam.
1:07:44
To do this, I'm going to open the message up. Remember, don't click on any attachments.
1:07:49
Come to the top of the message and I'll actually see a report spam button. Also, you don't even have to open the message up if you just
1:07:56
select it and come to the top. You'll see again, it looks like a little stop sign with an exclamation point in it.
1:08:03
This will add the message to your spam folder. Now, what Google does with spam is it will actually analyze the emails
1:08:10
and it goes through and makes sure that you don't get impacted by them. When you go to your spam folder, you'll see messages that
1:08:16
you've marked as spam there. Now, let's say that maybe it was an accident. You can select the message and either say Delete Forever or not spam.
1:08:24
This will remove it from your spam folder and put it back in your inbox. Another option is to make a message so that the person is blocked.
1:08:34
To do this, you're again going to open the message up and come to the top right hand corner. Next to the reply button, you'll see a vertical ellipses.
1:08:43
This will give you a list of options for dealing with this message, and one of them is to come down and say, if you look at this list, it actually gives
1:08:52
me an opportunity to block messages from this particular email account. Now, once the message has been blocked, you'll notice it tells me future messages
1:09:01
from this email will be marked as spam. So I'm gonna click on block. It shows me here.
1:09:06
Now I can either remove the message from spam or I will unblock the sender.
1:09:11
Unblock would mean that I would start getting messages from that email account, but it's really important to remember that you can get dangerous
1:09:19
content coming into your Google account. So being aware of suspicious messages and properly managing them is very important.
1:09:28
So protect yourself. Be smart. If something doesn't look right, don't open it. Put it in your spam folder or delete it, and don't be afraid to report it,
1:09:37
especially if you're using Gmail for work. Hi everyone.
Conclusion
1:09:43
Thank you so much for joining us on this part one of How to use Google's gmail.
1:09:48
We've spent time setting up a Gmail account. We've also looked at how easy it is to create new messages, add
1:09:55
attachments to those messages. And not only that, we've also explored being able to do settings
1:10:00
in our Google account to set it up the way we want it to run. We've also looked at being able to create labels and assign those labels to our
1:10:08
different Gmail messages, and then using those labels actually filter our inbox.
1:10:13
Not only that, we've also spent time looking at how to search and filter your Gmail account.
1:10:19
You're not ready to start sending Gmail, and please join us for the second portion of this course where we talk about how to use the chat and Google Meet features.
1:10:28
Also working with Google Contacts and your Google Calendar, so there's even more great content.
1:10:33
So come back and join us for that. Hello everybody. Welcome to our Google Gmail Fundamentals Part two course.
Introduction
1:10:42
My name's Elissa Smith, and in this course we're gonna go beyond the actual email part of Gmail.
1:10:48
Did you know that when you have a Google account you can do things like keep track of Google Contacts?
1:10:54
In this course, we're going to show you how you can also have a calendar associated with your Gmail account.
1:11:00
In this course, we're gonna look at how you can create, edit, and manage your Google Calendar. In addition to that, a Gmail account also comes with a chat feature.
1:11:08
You can even track tasks that are associated with your Google account, including notes.
1:11:14
So in this course, we're gonna look at how to knock the top off of just sending email through your Gmail account and look at all these other great components
1:11:21
that come with having a Google account and are easy to get to from Gmail.
Chat, Meet, and Spaces
1:11:28
Hi everyone. I want to introduce you to some really great features available through your Gmail account called Chat Meet and Spaces.
1:11:37
Now, why do these three additional features exist? It's because Gmail is not the always the most efficient way to communicate.
1:11:45
On average, email takes about eight business hours to get a response from. So when you need to connect with someone faster, that's where the Google Chat
1:11:54
meet and spaces features help you out. Now, first of all, in your Gmail account, you'll see over on the
1:12:00
left hand side in the navigation pane that if you click on more, you can access a chats area from there.
1:12:06
But what about the meet and also the additional feature of being able to have a Google space, you have to turn those areas on to do that.
1:12:16
We're setting in corner. And click on it. Now, there are two different ways to go about getting both the chat and
1:12:25
meet features available, and this will also activate the spaces area. If you come under the Quick Settings menu, you'll see that in apps in Gmail, there's
1:12:34
a chat and meet area At the very top. If you come in and select Customize, it just brings up a popup window
1:12:41
where you can check off both features. When you click on Done, you'll need to reload your Gmail app.
1:12:48
This will refresh, and you'll notice that on the left hand side of your navigation pane, you're now gonna have an additional task pain.
1:12:56
But again, it's something that you can expand and collapse. The other part of your Gmail navigation with this includes the Meet feature.
1:13:05
The spaces feature and the chat feature. Now, what exactly are these?
1:13:11
The chat feature is basically a place where you can chat with either people through Gmail or other people in your organization.
1:13:19
Then you have the spaces area. The spaces area is going to be a place where you can communicate
1:13:25
with one or more people. It's often used in an organization. It's a central place also, where people can share files, assign
1:13:32
tasks, and stay connected. Now the third area that you're going to see is the Google Meet
1:13:37
feature, and this is the ability to basically meet with someone online. So with a Google account, you can create video meetings, invite up
1:13:45
to a hundred participants, and meet up for 60 minutes per meeting at no cost using the Google Meet feature.
1:13:52
Now I wanna show you one more way that you can turn this on and off through your Gmail account.
1:13:58
I'm gonna come back up to the settings gear. When I click on settings, I'm gonna come to see all settings.
1:14:05
This will take me again into the settings that we explored a lot in the Gmail Fundamentals Part one.
1:14:11
So if you haven't taken that first hit, do it. But you'll see that at the top there are tabs and there's a chat and Meet area.
1:14:18
When I click on this, it allows me to go in and turn on the Google Chat and also the Google Meet.
1:14:25
Now when I do that, you'll see that over in the navigation pane, the spaces area is automatically part of that experience.
1:14:33
So it comes with it. And remember that these two areas, actually three areas, are not turned
1:14:38
on in your Gmail account by default. So you will need to come here into settings of which we showed you and
1:14:44
dot both Google Chat and Google Meet. And then make sure you click on Save Changes, go into your own Gmail
1:14:51
account and turn them on so you can explore with us in future lessons.
1:14:56
Hi everyone. I'd like to be able to get to the chat and spaces features of my Gmail account,
Navigating to Chats and Spaces
1:15:02
but not have to be in my Gmail inbox. While I do it for this, I can actually open up the chat portion of my Gmail
1:15:09
account separate from my inbox. A couple of different ways to do this. One of them is to go to the top right hand corner and use the waffle button.
1:15:18
Click on it and I will see that chat is actually one of. The many applications that come with a Google account.
1:15:25
When I click on this, it'll open up a new browser tab in whatever browser I'm using.
1:15:30
It'll say chat at the top and I'll see that the chat feature of my Google account will now be enabled.
1:15:36
Now, there aren't any chats in here yet, but that's because I haven't created any. As I start creating them, I'll see more.
1:15:43
Also, notice below in the navigation pane and area for spaces, these are those group or organizational conversations where I want to manage
1:15:51
additional content with my chats. Now, another way to do this same thing is to go up and add a new
1:15:57
browser tab, and then you're going to type in right there chat.google com.
1:16:03
Now, if you're already logged into your Gmail account, this will open up your chat area associated with your Google account and take you to the exact same place.
1:16:12
Either way, it's a great way to get in and again, be able to work with the chat and spaces features of a Google account without having to be part of your Gmail.
1:16:22
But remember from your Gmail, once you enable it, you can also get to chats and spaces just by coming over here to the far left hand side,
1:16:30
navigation and clicking on them. And this will actually take you to that area separate from your inbox, and it's
1:16:38
a lot faster than trying to open the new G, the new tabs in your Google account.
1:16:43
Now go into your own Google account and explore this, see what you prefer. In the next lesson, we're gonna look at how to actually create some chats.
Sending Chat
1:16:54
Hi everyone. I wanna be able to send my first chat from my Gmail account, so I do have the chat and meet features of my Gmail account enabled.
1:17:04
I'm gonna come over to the left hand side to the navigation pane and click on chat. This is a fantastic way to actually go from your inbox to your chats.
1:17:14
Now a couple things about sending a chat. To use Google Chat, the person that you're gonna be chatting with can
1:17:20
be outside your organization, but they need to have a Google account. So they need to be a Google Workspace user or have an account that ends with
1:17:28
Gmail or a non Gmail Google account. If the external account is a Google Workspace user, their administrator would
1:17:34
have to turn on Google Chat for their org. So there's a little bit of background work that has to be done for this
1:17:40
to work, but to send a new chat. Notice right here, there's a new chat button right below my Gmail icon, and
1:17:48
also right here in the very middle, of course, I'm going to need someone to chat with, and I actually have a recent coworker I've chatted with, and
1:17:56
I can select them from my recent list. Otherwise, I'd need to actually enter in either the space name or the person's
1:18:04
Gmail address right here at the top. I'm gonna click and it's going to take me in and show me any past
1:18:10
conversations I've had with this person. And then right here I can actually type in my message.
1:18:19
Now, this is not like email because this is like chatting on your cell phone. And by the way, there is a Google Chat app that you can
1:18:28
install on your mobile device. It works on both Android and Apple phones.
1:18:33
So I just type in my message and hit the send button, which is this little icon right here that looks kinda like a paper airplane.
1:18:41
Now my coworker or the person I'm chatting with will get that message and they can respond.
1:18:47
Now, another great thing about Google Chat is you can see them typing. I can actually see the person who's responding typing.
1:18:54
Now, the other great thing that you can do as well is respond instead with not, for example, text.
1:19:00
But notice here on the right that you can actually respond with emojis, GFIs, and other content.
1:19:06
I'm gonna use an emoticon, and sometimes an emoticon can say a lot more, for example, than words.
1:19:13
So we're having a chat conversation, and this is different than an email conversation.
1:19:19
And again, the way I got here was from the navigation pane of my Gmail account. Try sending a chat to someone that you work with or someone
1:19:27
that you know that has a Gmail account and play with this feature. Again, it's a very powerful way to have communication that's a
1:19:33
lot faster than an email message. Hi everyone.
Deleting Chat
1:19:39
The more you use Google Chats, you'll see that they are a really great way for quick
1:19:44
realtime communication, but sometimes they can overpower your Gmail and sometimes
1:19:51
you just need to get rid of them. So there are two options when it comes to turning off a chat or deleting it.
1:19:59
What I want, basically turn off a, I'm over into my. Chat pain, or I can see past chats.
1:20:06
When I come over to the right, I'll see a vertical ellipses. Now, if you've taken the part one, you're gonna know that these are the
1:20:13
more button of your Gmail account. When you click on this, you'll see different options to help you
1:20:18
manage your Gmail account, one of which is to hide the conversation. This will just remove it.
1:20:24
It's not deleting it, but removing it from your chat history. The other important thing to note before I do this is that
1:20:32
my chat history is turned on. This means that they'll be saved. If it's not turned on.
1:20:37
They're not saved with your Google account. So I'm gonna click on hide conversation and it's gone.
1:20:43
Now, notice here it gives me an option to find a chat. I will need the name of the person I chatted with to find it.
1:20:50
So I type their name in or find them from my frequent list for contacts,
1:20:56
and you'll notice that it puts that chat conversation back over here. My list of recent chats.
1:21:02
To delete a chat, you're going to come to the left hand side again, or I should say to the vertical ellipses.
1:21:08
It's on the right. And you'll see there is a delete conversation button. When I click on this, it deletes the entire conversation.
1:21:17
But notice it tells me here that other participants, the people that have been in the chat with me, will still be able to view it.
1:21:25
The only person who will have it deleted is me. Also, it's important to notice that this is a permanent thing,
1:21:32
so only do it when you need to. When I click on delete, it'll be gone.
1:21:37
So in a normal Gmail account, you can hide chats, you can delete chats, you can't, however edit them.
1:21:44
And this can be a little bit frustrating. You can only edit or delete a Google Chat if you use a chat
1:21:51
on a work or school account. Now, I showed you here that I could delete it, but I couldn't edit it.
1:21:56
So again, it's limited functionality in the normal Gmail account's, not associated with, for example, my work or school.
1:22:07
Welcome back everybody. We wanna show you a feature called Google Spaces. Now, people will ask, why do you have both Google Chat and Google Spaces?
Creating Spaces
1:22:16
Well, the Gmail and Chat app is more for text-based communication, whereas
1:22:22
spaces can allow you and the groups that you work with to communicate in threads, upload files, assign tasks.
1:22:28
So it's a much more complex application than just sending messages that the Google Chat provides.
1:22:34
And your Google Chats can also be part of your experience inside spaces. So I'm inside my Gmail account, and you'll see that over here on the left.
1:22:42
I have an area called Spaces, and another way to check for this is to make sure that your chat is turned on.
1:22:49
Remember, you can go up to the cog in the top right hand corner to double check that your chat's on, but now that we can see the spaces area over
1:22:57
on the left, I wanna create a space. So to do this, I'm gonna come over to Spaces and Click.
1:23:04
Now I don't have any spaces yet. This will be my first one. So you'll see that when I come in, it gives me two options.
1:23:10
One is to create a space. The second one is to browse existing spaces.
1:23:15
Since this is our first one, we're going to create a space. So I'm gonna click on Create a Space.
1:23:21
It wants me to give it a name. I'm gonna call mine Project abc.
1:23:28
Notice that you can add a description that's of course, arbitrary, but it's always nice if the space is going to be used, especially for a group who may
1:23:35
not necessarily know, but it's for now. Importantly, down below, I need to enter in the names or emails of the
1:23:44
people that will be part of my space. Now, there are two places this can come from. The first one are your Google contacts, the people that you've saved, that
1:23:52
you send email to and communicate with through your Google Suite. The second one would be email addresses.
1:23:58
You'll see right here that anyone that's been added to my contacts is available, so I can select their name.
1:24:03
I can also copy and place an email address in. And also, if you were to start typing someone's name in and they
1:24:10
were actually in your contacts, it would also find them for you. Now, additionally, I need to click on create at the bottom.
1:24:17
This is what will actually make my new space. I can always add more people to the space later on, but now the space is created.
1:24:24
Go into your own Google account and try making a space of your own and join us as we're gonna continue our journey, looking at how you can share files and communicate
1:24:33
in this area, in your Google Suite. Hi everybody. Welcome back.
Adding Members to Spaces and Threaded Space Chat
1:24:38
I wanna show you how to add an additional member to your Google space and also how to start some threaded chats.
1:24:45
Now, from my Gmail, I'm gonna come over here to the left hand navigation pane and locate the spaces icon.
1:24:51
This will open up again, another area where you can see any existing spaces you've created, or also at the top create a new space.
1:24:59
I'm gonna go ahead and click on my project ABC space that I recently created.
1:25:04
Now from here you're gonna see ongoing conversations, and then at the top it shows me the name of the space and how many members are
1:25:11
currently in my workspace or space. I'm gonna click on the arrow next to the title and you'll see a dropdown
1:25:17
to help you manage the space. The very top is a manage members option. This is where you can go in to see who the current members of your
1:25:25
Google space are and add new people. Now who can be part of your space. Usually it needs to be someone with a Gmail.
1:25:32
At the end of their, again, email account, I'm gonna click on add and type in the member of another person who's going to add.
1:25:39
Or become a part of my space. Now, they will get an invitation, and once they accept that invitation,
1:25:46
then they'll be added to my space. So once they click on add, I won't see them get added until
1:25:51
they've accepted that invitation. Now I also want to contribute to one of the conversations that's
1:25:56
ongoing between space members. So what I'm gonna do is go back to my space by clicking on its name.
1:26:02
You'll see the current conversation thread. Now, if I would like to respond to an insight thread,
1:26:08
you'll see that right here. It shows me that within this thread, there are some additional replies. When I click on this, it opens up a secondary menu over on the right that
1:26:17
shows me I'm in a threaded conversation. Pain
1:26:23
I can add to it just by adding it into this pop out pain.
1:26:32
Anyone who is in, again, the space can contribute to the conversation, but if I ever want to close it back up again, I can either click on the X
1:26:40
in the top right corner, or I can open it up again just by coming right here and seeing how many replies there are to that specific piece of information.
1:26:49
Now, we'd love to have you try this out. So in your own space, try creating a threaded chat and also try out
1:26:56
adding some new members to the group.
Sharing Files Through Spaces
1:27:01
Hi everybody. I'm ready to share a file in my Google Spaces area. So what I've done is I've come back into my space and I'm
1:27:08
starting a new conversation. I'm gonna go ahead and paste in some text to preface the file that I'll be sharing through my again chat area.
1:27:16
And then I just want you to notice that on the right hand side of the conversations area, you have formatting buttons.
1:27:22
You can also add emoticons gif fees. Then the fourth button over from the right is the upload file button.
1:27:29
This allows you to find a file that's saved locally on your computer or network. Navigate to that file and then actually upload it into your chat.
1:27:38
So this can take a little bit of time depending on the size of the file, but you can see right here, it even shows me the type of file it is.
1:27:45
It's a simple Excel file, and it even shows me a preview when possible to actually send it.
1:27:50
I'm going to come right here and click on the send button now, who will have access to this file? That's a really good question.
1:27:56
Anyone who's in my space will now have access to this file. You can see here that it's been shared again in my chat of my space.
1:28:04
Now, if I come to the file after it's been posted, I can click on it and where it can, it will actually preview what the file looks
1:28:10
like for me so that I can see it. Notice at the top, there's a button here that will allow me to
1:28:15
go back to my Google Spaces area. In addition, I have a print button and also an opportunity to download the file.
1:28:22
So when I share a file this way, it's actually in my opinion, better than emailing it because we can all have access to the file without actually
1:28:30
having to download it to our device, and it's a great way to collaborate. Now that the file's been shared, everyone again, who is part of this Google
1:28:38
space, will have access to the file. Again, go into your own Google space, try it out.
1:28:44
It's a really great way to add collaboration to the communication that you're already having inside of your spaces area.
Creating, Assigning, and Marking Tasks as Complete
1:28:53
Hey everybody. Welcome back. What if you have a task that you need people to work on within your
1:28:58
Google space, and what happens to those files that you share in the chat of your Google space?
1:29:03
Well, let's take a look. I'm in one of my Google spaces, and you'll see that at the top I actually have a chat button.
1:29:08
That's where you spend most of your time and your communicating. But as files are shared as they have been in this Google space, you'll see
1:29:16
there's also a second tab for files. So even though you share the file through the Google Space area, it's
1:29:22
actually stored in the files area. This is kind of like group cloud storage where everyone in the space
1:29:28
can have access to these files, and it makes it a little bit easier to find the files if you come here.
1:29:33
So any of the files that I share through the chat can be accessed here. Notice over on the right, in addition, it gives me an opportunity
1:29:40
right here you'll see to actually view these files in the chat. So if I click right here, it takes me in and shows me where the file was
1:29:48
originally added to the space area. Now another question comes up when we need to get something done.
1:29:54
How do we track that in our space? Well, there's also a tab for that called tasks, and notice that if I come down,
1:30:01
I'm gonna see that in my chat area. It's actually already mentioned two different tasks that
1:30:07
have been already added. So when you add a task to the task area of your space, it mentions
1:30:13
it here inside the chat area. So if people aren't focused on the tasks tab, they can still
1:30:19
know that tasks are being added. When you go to the tasks area, you'll see tasks, the dates that they need
1:30:25
to be again completed and who they've been assigned to within the space. In the top right hand corner, there's a button that will allow
1:30:32
you to update the order, again, of the different tasks you're seeing. By default, they're going to be listed in ascending order with
1:30:39
the newest tasks at the top. Now what I wanna do here is come right here to the top to add a new task, and I
1:30:45
just need to type in the name of my task.
1:30:55
There's an additional space to add details. And then over on the right, I need to pick the date and time that the task will be due.
1:31:02
Notice you pick the date and then down below you can pick a specific time. The time is optional. You don't have to do that, but if you want to be that specific, you can be.
1:31:11
And the other great thing is every member of your space can be assigned this task. So I'm actually gonna assign this task to my coworker, and when I'm
1:31:19
finished, I'm gonna click on add. Now I see it get added here, but also if I wanted to go out and see
1:31:25
where it's been mentioned inside the chat, I can click right here. It takes me out. And it also includes an app mentioned to the work I should say to my spaces
1:31:34
member who's been assigned the task. When I come back, you're gonna notice on the right hand side of every task
1:31:40
there's a delete button and everyone who is a member of this space will
1:31:45
see this task pain and be able to come in and participate in the tasks. All you have to do to Mark Task Complete is click on it and it actually checks
1:31:53
it off and notice it completes it down here at the bottom, you can see that it tells you the task has been completed.
1:31:59
There's also an undue button, and I even see it gray out right here. If I decide that, for example, I wanna come in and un have a task be
1:32:06
not completed, I can uncheck it and it marks it as being uncomplete. It's a very simple, great way to keep track of who's doing what when you're
1:32:15
working together in a Google space, go in and try creating some tasks of your own and uh, keep up with what you're getting done inside of Google Spaces.
Deleting Spaces
1:32:26
Hey everybody. Welcome back. I wanna show you how to delete a Google space. If it ends up, you don't need it anymore.
1:32:32
Now remember, you can only delete a space if you're the space creator. When you delete a space, all the messages and tasks in the space are also deleted.
1:32:40
Permissions on the files that are shared in the space are removed, but the file isn't deleted.
1:32:46
And once a space is deleted, you can't get it back. So it's nonrecoverable. But the good news is you can get rid of a space if you no longer need it.
1:32:54
Now, I'm the one who created my spaces, so I'm gonna come in right here and go to the spaces area. From my Gmail.
1:33:00
You'll see that I have two spaces here. I am the originator or creator of both the spaces.
1:33:06
I can see that because when I come in and look at the space and click on it, if I come right here and actually go in and look at the member details or
1:33:13
manage members, I'm the space manager. This means I'm the person that the space started with.
1:33:20
That means I can delete it To delete this space. I'm gonna go back in and just click on this space name, and then you'll see
1:33:27
right here that I have this chat area. What I wanna do is come up above it and click back on the space name again,
1:33:34
and then come down to the very bottom. And because again, I was the space manager or the person who
1:33:40
created the space, I can delete it. When I click on delete, it reminds me that all the messages and tasks that
1:33:48
are part of the space will be deleted. The files won't be, when I click on delete, you'll see
1:33:53
that it's no longer in my space navigation pane, so now it's gone. So they're really easy to create and delete.
1:34:00
Just remember that once they're deleted, all the content inside of them will also be.
Adding Video Meetings to Google Space
1:34:08
Hi everybody. I wanna just mention a few important points about managing a Google space
1:34:13
and also about adding a video meeting to, again, a Google Space area.
1:34:19
So I'm back inside my Google space and I'm gonna come up to the current space that I want to manage and click on its name.
1:34:26
You'll see that when I do this, I get a menu to help me do important things. Now, we've already looked at how to manage the membership of your Google space, but
1:34:34
notice right here you can also set up notifications for how new messages and replies are going to occur in the space.
1:34:40
You can also turn off your chat history. This means that after 24 hours, all the messages in the space will be deleted.
1:34:47
And then notice if you are a member of a Google space and decide you no longer want to be, you can leave it and then additionally deleting it.
1:34:55
Now the final area that we wanna talk about with spaces is how to add a video meeting to your Google Workspace.
1:35:01
You can see an example of one right here. Now, how was this done? I'm gonna come in and I'm actually gonna go to a new chat, and you'll
1:35:09
see that on the far right hand side there is a small video camera. This allows me to add a video meeting to my current workspace chat area.
1:35:17
When I click on this, you'll see that it opens up a little icon that looks like a video camera.
1:35:23
This is for me to have kind of a spontaneous video meeting. If I click on this, once I send it, it's going to post it into my chat feed
1:35:31
for all the members of my Google Space. When I click on it, it will take me into the Google Meet tool that
1:35:37
allows me to do video meetings. Now with these meetings, you can have up to a hundred participants and a 60 minute
1:35:43
meeting that doesn't cost any money. Right here, you're gonna see that when I'm ready to join, I can click
1:35:48
on join now, and it will actually take me in to my video meeting. Down on the bottom, I've got great tools like the ability to mute and unmute
1:35:56
my mic, also control my video camera. Lots of great features, and anyone who's part of my Google space
1:36:03
would see that meeting inside my chat area of my Google space. And they would also be able to join this meeting as well.
1:36:10
It's a great way to make your spaces a lot more interactive and engaging when you add the meeting feature.
1:36:16
And as always, after the meeting's over, if I were to go back to my Google space, I'd see that the mention of the video meeting is inside the chat is
1:36:25
a history to let everybody know that there was a meeting that happened. So try it out. Go into your own Google Workspace, I should say, space, and try adding
1:36:34
a video meeting to your space area and see if you can get some of your fellow Google Space members to join it.
Joining or Creating Instant Meetings with Google Meet
1:36:42
Welcome back everybody. I wanna show you how to actually create your own video meeting from inside Gmail.
1:36:48
Over on the left hand side, I have the Meet feature turned on. Once I click on this, you're gonna see that it takes me into my meet area.
1:36:56
This is where I can set up impromptu meetings right here. You'll notice that it gives me a new meeting option and also join with code.
1:37:03
This is where someone can give you a code to their own Google video meeting that you can type in here.
1:37:09
Copy and paste is easier. And then join the meeting to create a new instant meeting. I just click on new meeting.
1:37:14
It opens up right here. And notice that I can start the instant meeting right here, or I can copy this
1:37:19
link and actually email it to someone. Now I'd like to send this invite to a coworker or to someone
1:37:25
that I'm gonna be working with. So I'm gonna click on Send Invite. You'll see that I can share via email.
1:37:30
It takes me into a new tab in my email. It includes all the different meeting information, including
1:37:35
the meeting, the link. And then I'm gonna go ahead and shoot it off to the coworker that I want to send the meeting invite to, and I can send it right from Gmail.
1:37:44
The Google meet is still going to be open right here, but I'm emailing them an invitation to my meeting.
1:37:49
Now, if it ends up that I'd like to just do an impromptu meeting, I'm gonna come in and just do new meeting.
1:37:56
And then I'm going to come in and say, start now. So this just means a meeting that will be what we call impromptu
1:38:01
or spontaneous on the fly. There's a lot of different names for these kinds of meetings. When I start now, I will be the only one in this meeting, so
1:38:09
hopefully I have copied that code and I've sent it to my coworkers. But you can see here how it's connecting.
1:38:16
I have my video camera turned off and notice I can toggle my video on. Also, I have my ability to mute and unmute myself.
1:38:23
I have closed captioning along with the ability to raise my hand during a meeting, add emoticons.
1:38:30
And then even if you'll see right here, I can present my screen and some additional features, including a whiteboard, for example.
1:38:36
And also when I'm done, I can click on the leave call button and it will end my video meeting.
1:38:42
But it's great that right from Gmail, I can communicate with my coworkers and go in and create a video meeting using the meet feature.
1:38:50
So go into your own Gmail and try creating a video meeting and see how it really adds to how you can communicate with your coworkers or with others
1:38:59
that you work with through Gmail.
Joining Meetings from Google Space
1:39:04
Hi everyone. I wanna show you how to join a video meeting from your Google space.
1:39:10
So inside my Google space, I see that there's a meeting that was started by my coworker.
1:39:15
And I would like to join it underneath where it mentions the meeting. In the chat area, there is a link that when I hover over,
1:39:21
it'll say, join video meeting. When I click on this, it takes me into another browser tab.
1:39:27
Notice up here. This is the pre joinin screen from my Google video meeting. It tells me who's already in the meeting.
1:39:34
And notice right here I can decide if I want to join with my video and audio on, or like one of my best practices for joining Google meetings
1:39:41
is to always join with my audio off, just in case, for example, my dog goes berserk in the background.
1:39:47
I'm gonna click right here on Join. Now, this will join me into the meeting. You'll notice that I'm joining with my video and audio off, but once I'm in the
1:39:55
meeting, I can again turn these toggles on and off to enable those different things. And also in the bottom right corner of my Google meeting, I can see who's
1:40:03
currently in the meeting with me. So all my coworkers, and again space members will come up in this list.
1:40:09
I can also see if their audio is muted. And remember, inside these Google meetings, you have great tools
1:40:15
like the capacity to present from your screen, add reactions even. For example, raise your hand when I'm done with my meeting that
1:40:22
I joined from my Google space. All I need to do is click on the leave call button and I'm able to leave the meeting and I can always come back and close the tab that
1:40:30
opened and I'll be back in my Google space area ready to continue working. This won't kick anyone else who's in the meeting out.
1:40:37
It would allow them to continue working. But again, it's great that I have this ability to go from a chat.
1:40:43
To a virtual meeting and then come right back out and continue doing what I was doing before.
1:40:49
Really try this in your own Google space. Go in and try to add a video meeting and join it and see how it can
1:40:54
really add to the collaboration that you have within your Google space.
Accessing and Saving Contacts
1:41:02
Hi everyone. An important part of being able to communicate and collaborate with people using the Google Suite is keeping track of their contact information.
1:41:11
Google's very aware of this, and that's why for a very long time, not only have you been able to manage your email through your Google Suite, but you
1:41:18
also have access to Google Contacts. This is one of the most widely used contact management tools available to
1:41:24
people, and it's an essential part of Google's suite of web applications. It's gonna store your contact information, both for personal
1:41:31
and professional purposes. So let's look at how you access your Google contacts from your Gmail account.
1:41:37
So right now, I'm in my Gmail. Now the contacts are actually stored in the Google Suite, but not actually in your Gmail.
1:41:44
There are different ways to access them, but I'm gonna show you the main front door. I'm gonna come to the top right hand corner to the waffle button that allows
1:41:51
me access to my other Google apps. Remember, it looks like a Rubik's Cube, but it's called the Google App button.
1:41:58
When I click on this, I see the other apps that are available from my Gmail account, and if I come down, I'll see that Contacts is one of the apps under this list.
1:42:07
When I click on it, it's going to open up a new browser tab. So again, my Gmail will be opened in the first browser tab, but now I'll see that
1:42:14
the second one is called Google Contacts. We can see it up here. And this is taking me into the contacts that I currently have stored.
1:42:21
Now, manual way to create a new contact is to come to the top left hand corner, and after I click on it, I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to click on the
1:42:30
create contact button in the top left. This will allow me to either create one contact at a time or multiple contacts.
1:42:38
We're gonna start with just one. I type in the name of the person, and obviously I can also copy and
1:42:46
paste and notice that it's going to include important information like company name, title,
1:42:57
and email. I can also include information like their phone number, birthday notes,
1:43:02
and there are additional fields as well that can give me even more detail. When I'm done, I'm gonna click on save.
1:43:09
And now this contact will be saved with my Google account, which means no matter where I go on what computer, if I have a secure login,
1:43:16
I'll be able to access this content. And also the contacts information. It's a great way to create your own list of people that you work with.
1:43:25
That's just part of your Gmail account. Go into your own Google account and try it out. Add some contacts so that you can have that important
1:43:32
information from wherever you go.
1:43:37
Okay, everybody. How do you add an incoming Gmail from someone new to your Google Contacts?
Adding Email to Contacts
1:43:44
It's actually pretty easy to do, but you do need to open up the actual email message. So I've come into my Gmail account and I'm gonna double click on this new message.
1:43:53
When I open it up, you'll see at the top that we can see an icon representing the person that the message is from.
1:43:59
And if I actually hover over this, it shows me contact information for them. And in the top right hand corner, if they have not been added to my Google
1:44:08
Contacts yet, I see a circle with a head and shoulders and a plus sign. If I click on this, it will actually take this person and their email address
1:44:16
and add it to my Google Contacts. Also, notice right here, I can click on open detailed view, and over on the right
1:44:22
it's gonna show me their information. Once I'm done doing that, if I come up to the top right-hand corner, come back
1:44:29
down to my Google apps and go into my contacts, I'll now see that if I look
1:44:34
at this list, the person who I just received that message from has been added. Now, if I'd like to add more detail, I'm gonna come right here on the same
1:44:43
line and click on the pencil on the right hand side of their contact. This will take me in to where I see the basic information that was
1:44:50
provided from the email, which is their name and their email address. If I wanna add additional information, then I need to come in and type
1:44:58
it in because it won't capture a ton from the actual Gmail message
1:45:04
so I can add that additional information and edit the contact. This is a great way to quickly start really building your contact database
1:45:12
by going directly from Gmail and adding those contacts in, and then you can add the details that you want after they've been added from Gmail.
1:45:20
Go into your own Gmail and try adding some contacts again from the people who are already sending you email messages.
1:45:25
It's a great way to work and really build that list of contacts so that you have it for when you need it.
Adding Labels to Contacts
1:45:33
Hey everybody. What about being able to manage your contacts with categories of your own?
1:45:39
Now, we looked at this in the Gmail part one, but now we wanna look at the idea of applying a Google label to our contacts.
1:45:47
You'll see that right now in my contacts. I do have one label. It's turned on under my labels category right here, and it's my work category.
1:45:55
What if I'd also like to create a label called Personal that I could apply to my contacts? What I wanna do for this is come over to the left hand side of my contacts list,
1:46:04
and I'll see that I have a labels area where I can come down and create a label.
1:46:10
All I need to do is provide my label with a name. I'm gonna type in the word personal and then click on save.
1:46:17
Now once the label has been saved, how do I apply it to the contact? I like to go back to the contact list and actually come to the contact.
1:46:26
I'd like to apply a specific label to, you'll notice that on the right hand side of your different contacts, you have a star that would allow you to,
1:46:33
for example, favorite that contact. But in addition, there's the pencil button to edit, and then the vertical
1:46:39
ellipses, this is the more button. When I click on it, I'm going to see, again, the ability to print and export
1:46:45
my contacts, but also apply labels. I'm gonna click on personal, and once I do that, when I come out, I'll see
1:46:51
the personal label has been applied, so it's fairly easy for me to go down through my contact list and just use this vertical ellipses to actually
1:46:59
apply different labels to each of my contacts until I've gotten them applied. Now, what's the use case?
1:47:05
Once I've applied labels to my contacts, I can now come over to my navigation pane in my contacts view, and when I wanna see all of my work contacts, I click on the work
1:47:15
label and only my work contacts come up. If I want to come in and adjust my personal contacts, I can click
1:47:22
on that and then I see those. And at any time I want to adjust one of the labels I've applied. I can go back to the ellipses, next to the label, just come to the check mark
1:47:30
and say, remove from label, and it will remove that contact from that label. It does not remove it from my contacts list, it just takes the label off.
1:47:41
It's a great way to create your own categories for your contacts. That you can then filter by using the label.
1:47:47
Go into your own Google contacts, try to create a couple of labels and apply them and see how it really makes keeping things organized a lot easier.
Editing, Printing, and Deleting Contacts
1:47:57
Hello? What if you need to just have your contact on paper? You can print your contacts from Google in a number of different ways.
1:48:05
So I'm in my contacts inside of my Google account, and I have a couple of different options. The first one is to come to the contact I wanna print, just check mark the
1:48:14
name, and then come up to the vertical ellipses on the toolbar above the contact. When I do this, it gives me an option to print my contact.
1:48:22
You'll see that it will ask me that I'm only printing one selected contact. It'll take me into a print preview.
1:48:28
This particular contact only includes the person's name and email address, and then I can click on print.
1:48:34
What about if I want to print from inside the contact? I'm gonna open the contact up by clicking on it.
1:48:41
I see the contact card, and then I'm gonna come up to the top right corner and look for the ellipses.
1:48:47
This is also my way to edit the details behind the contact and work with it. When I click on this ellipses, again, I get an option to print the contact.
1:48:56
When I click on this, it takes me in and again, I'll see more detail and then I can click on print and it prints it off.
1:49:03
Now, in addition, if I ever want to go in and edit a contact notice from the contact card, I have an edit button right here.
1:49:09
This'll take me in so that I can add details to the contact. And of course, after I make those changes, I can save the changes just
1:49:16
by clicking on the save button and it will update everything in my contact. Additionally, a contact can be deleted and there are multiple options for that.
1:49:24
I like to go to my contact list, select a contact, and if I want for any reason to delete them.
1:49:30
Once they're selected, you'll notice here that there is three dots next to the row that they're on where I can delete.
1:49:36
Also, up at the top, you're gonna see that there's an option to delete the contact from there as well.
1:49:42
Keep in mind, you can also export your contacts when you export them. They can be exported either as a Google CSV file or an outlet CSV file, or even a
1:49:51
V card that works for Apple devices, and by exporting them, then you can import
1:49:57
them into maybe a contact management system for that particular device. But really what you're gonna see is that working with contacts is pretty easy.
1:50:05
So go into your own Google contacts and try working with them.
1:50:11
Welcome back. I need to spend a little bit more time managing my contacts. First of all, in Google Contacts.
Recovering Deleted Contacts
1:50:18
Where do I go for the settings of my Google Contacts app? Well, we have Google Contacts open.
1:50:23
I'm gonna go to the top right hand corner to the settings menu because I'm in my Google Contacts.
1:50:28
When I click on the settings gear, that's what I see. If I come down to more settings, you'll see it takes me into the basic
1:50:35
settings of my contacts application. They include my default country. You'll notice when I click here, it opens up another browser tab and shows
1:50:43
me what my default language is, mine's English, and additionally, it will let me also decide what country I'm from.
1:50:50
And then how to sort my contacts. I can either sort them by first name or last name, and I can say those.
1:50:55
So it's pretty basic. Now, additionally, if I would like to print all the contacts in my contact
1:51:01
list, you'll see that over in my contacts navigation pane, there is a print button. This is really great when you just wanna contact, print all your contacts.
1:51:10
When I click on print, you'll show that it prints me off a list, which can be nice when you want a comprehensive list.
1:51:16
What if I've deleted a contact? So if I come in and click on a contact, select it, and then come up
1:51:21
to the ellipses and delete it, it's removed from my contact list, I'm going to move it to my trash can.
1:51:28
But notice right here, it will tell me that any contacts that I delete will be permanently deleted after 30 days.
1:51:35
So Google gives me a 30 day grace period. Now, in the meantime, those contacts are actually here in my trash, much
1:51:43
like my Gmail that gets deleted. But here I won't see emails. I'll see my Google contacts.
1:51:49
If there are contacts here that I don't want permanently deleted, I get that 30 day grace period. After that, they will be permanently deleted.
1:51:56
And notice it tells me that also that I can empty the trash. But let's say I don't want these contacts deleted.
1:52:02
I've accidentally placed them here and I need to get them back out. I can select both of them by checking them off and up above
1:52:09
I'll now see a recover option. This allows me to actually take these contacts and remove
1:52:15
them from the trash can. And if I go back to my contacts list, it places them right back where they were before.
1:52:22
So if you accidentally delete a contact, it's okay. Go to your trash, can select it and recover it back out.
1:52:29
But remember, you only get 30 days after that, your contacts will be permanently deleted.
1:52:36
So feel free to go into your Google contacts and try this out. Just make sure you recover the contacts if you're playing with it.
Accessing and Adjusting Google Calendar View
1:52:47
Hi everyone. We are ready to talk about one of my favorite features that comes with the Google Suite, and that is how easy it is to access your Google Calendar from Gmail.
1:52:57
When you sign up for a Google account, you automatically have access to this fantastic calendar app and it's really easy to get to from your Gmail.
1:53:06
So here I am in my Gmail. And to access the calendar, I'm gonna come up to the Google app
1:53:11
bar in the top right hand corner. Remember, it looks like Rubik's Cube. When you click on it, you're gonna see the other apps that come
1:53:18
with your Google Suite Go down until you see the calendar icon. It's pretty easy to find when you left.
1:53:25
Click on it. It will launch your calendar in a separate browser tab. Now let's talk for a minute about how you can update your view.
1:53:32
When you're in this calendar. You'll see that in the top right hand corner, you've got two important options.
1:53:38
The first one is it will tell you what time sequence you're in right now. So right now I'm viewing a month view, but if I click on this, you'll notice
1:53:45
that I can view my calendar by the day. I can also view it by the week, and by default it will include weekends.
1:53:54
I can also see it by month, year, and then even four day stretches of time.
1:53:59
Now, a couple of additional things you can also do when you're in this notice that if you don't want your weekends, you can come down and uncheck this
1:54:07
bottom option and it will turn it off. Now, as far as calendar settings, you'll see that on the left hand
1:54:13
side of that, again time setting, you have your settings menu. This allows you to go into your settings for your calendar.
1:54:20
This will again let you make sure that you have the correct time zone selected, and also the format that you want the dates to be showing in.
1:54:28
To get out of this, if you just click on the back arrow in the top left hand corner, next to settings, it will take you back to your calendar.
1:54:34
There's also in the top left hand corner toggles to allow you to take the calendar and go between different time increments.
1:54:41
So since I'm in the month view, this will move me forward one month at a time.
1:54:47
And then the today button helps you to always get back to the current day and it'll be highlighted.
1:54:52
So in this case, the current date for me is highlighted with a blue highlight on the particular date.
1:54:58
And if I wanna move to a different day in my calendar, I can come over on the left hand side to the navigation pane.
1:55:03
Click on the date I want to move to, and using the same time increment, it moves me for forward.
1:55:08
It's really a very intuitive, easy to use interface. Google has done a fantastic job making this calendar easy to work with.
1:55:16
It doesn't take very long to get used to. So again, I challenge you to get into your Gmail, open up your
1:55:22
calendar, and just start clicking around and see how easy it is to use.
1:55:29
Hi everyone. I wanna show you how to create an event or a meeting in your Google Calendar and also a recurring event.
Creating Google Calendar Events and Recurring Events
1:55:35
Now, right now I'm seeing my Google calendar in a week view. The weekends are turned on. To create an event, I'm gonna come up to the top left hand
1:55:42
corner to the create button. It's pretty big, so it's hard to miss. When you click on this, I'm gonna select event and it will
1:55:49
open up a new event window. I need to add my title.
1:55:54
Then down below, you'll see the first thing it asks me is going to be the date of my meeting. Now I can update this just by clicking on it, and it will populate again,
1:56:02
a calendar that I can pick from. I can pick the correct date for my meeting, and then also I can
1:56:08
come in and adjust the time. Now remember, these times are coming from the settings of your calendar,
1:56:14
and the reason it's doing one hour settings is because that's the default. There's also an opportunity to do time zone add guests.
1:56:22
These would be coworkers or other people that are in your contacts that you are going to be inviting to attend your meeting.
1:56:29
Additionally, you're gonna see that I can add a Google Meet option to make it into a video conferencing meeting.
1:56:35
This would actually, again, take me into Google Meet and provide that information, and I can have up to a hundred guests attend one of these meetings.
1:56:43
Now, what if I have a file that I'd like to also add to the meeting? As you come down, you'll see that.
1:56:49
Additionally, I can add descriptions or attachments. Remember, the attachments can either come from your Google
1:56:55
Drive or you can upload them. Once you add an attachment, it will be copied into the meeting
1:57:01
invite, and all you have to do to send it off is click on save. Now the people you've invited to the meeting will also receive an invite
1:57:08
in their Google Gmail account or through email to your Google meeting. So I'm going to save it and I'll just write here.
1:57:15
It's asking me if I would like to send calendar invitations to guests. I would. So I'm gonna click on send, and it's been saved and added to my calendar.
1:57:23
Now again, for me to be able to see the meeting, I need to go to the day, here's the actual calendar event, and if I click on it, it will open up.
1:57:30
Now what about a reoccurring calendar event? The only difference is that you set a recurring pattern
1:57:36
when you create the event. So I'm gonna come back up to create Go to event again, type in the name of the event,
1:57:45
and then underneath where I pick the date for the meeting to begin. What's really important is after I pick my first date for the meeting,
1:57:52
then I set up a recurrence pattern. Right now it says, do not repeat, but notice I can now
1:57:57
say weekly, every Wednesday. I can also set up a custom pattern where I say, and after a certain amount of time,
1:58:05
and I can also adjust the time as well. This will make this into a meeting that will recur every Wednesday, starting
1:58:11
March 8th, and then when I click on save, it will get added to my calendar, but it will be recurring for those 13 occurrences, and then it will turn off.
1:58:20
Now, as always, go in and try this out. Go to your Google calendar, try creating a couple of events.
1:58:26
They're also really easy to delete because after you create one, if you decide you don't need it anymore, open it up.
1:58:32
Notice in the top right hand corner, there's a trash can. And if I delete on this, if I click on it, if it's a recurring event,
1:58:38
it'll ask me to either delete just this one or all the events. If I do just the event, then all the other ones will still be in my calendar,
1:58:45
but it's really easy to remove them. So make some of your own and try it out.
Responding to Google Calendar Invites
1:58:53
Okay, I want to respond to a calendar event invite in my Google Gmail account.
1:58:59
So I've come into my inbox, I can see the, again, calendar invite right here. I'm gonna click on it and it opens it up.
1:59:05
One great thing that Google has done here is put everything you need right at the top. You're gonna see the name of the meeting.
1:59:11
Also the date, time and time zone, and then also who it's from. Coming down, I can see my opportunities to respond.
1:59:19
Yes means I'm coming. Maybe it's tentative and no means I'm not going to come.
1:59:25
Notice the color. There's also a more options button on the right hand side of the no button, allowing you to propose a new time or add an additional note about the meeting.
1:59:34
Yes, I am going to be going. Now, if this is a video conferencing meeting, notice the Google Meet is
1:59:40
here as well, with a link and a meeting link under that, down on the bottom. If I respond with a yes, you'll see it actually opens up a new browser tab.
1:59:49
It can take just a few moments to open, takes me into my calendar, and if I look
1:59:55
at my calendar, I can see right here that the meeting has been added to my calendar. And if I open it up, I can see again the same information, the name of the
2:00:04
meeting, the date and time, and then who again the meeting organizer is. This is the coworker or person that sent me the meeting invite
2:00:12
and the green check mark meeting. Yes, I will be attending the meeting. So it's really great because you can go straight from your Gmail into your
2:00:19
Google calendar and see these events get added and it's really easy to do. So don't be afraid to try sending someone a calendar invite and watch them respond
2:00:28
and see how it keeps track of all of it right inside of your Google calendar. It's pretty cool.
Sharing Calendars and Editing Calendar Events
2:00:34
Welcome back. I wanna show you how to share a calendar, edit a calendar, and also viewing other calendars.
2:00:40
So I'm back in my Gmail calendar or Google calendar, and I'd like to share a calendar
2:00:46
with someone that I work closely with. Remember, when you share calendars, it's important to be aware of the
2:00:51
permissions that you're providing to the person you're sharing the calendar with. So only share the calendar with people you trust.
2:00:57
Right here on the left, I'm gonna see my calendar. This is the calendar with my name or the person I'm playing.
2:01:03
There's an ellipses that appears next to it. I'm gonna click on that and then I'm gonna come to settings and sharing.
2:01:09
This takes me not only into the sharing of the calendar, but also the personal settings for it. This includes information like the name of the calendar, it's time zone,
2:01:18
but as I come down, you'll notice that right here I can add other people and groups to this calendar.
2:01:24
So when I click on this, brings up a list of the people who are in my contacts. I can select one of them, and then underneath, I also need to decide what
2:01:33
level of permission I'm giving them. If I wanna give them limited access, I can pick the top level.
2:01:38
Make sure you realize what you're sharing when you do this, and then click on send. They'll receive an invitation to my calendar in their own Gmail account.
2:01:46
Then when they click on, they'll be able to see it over here. Now, if I ever need to edit a calendar event, what I want to do is come
2:01:53
to the event I want to edit, click on it, and at the top I'll see an edit button, which is a pencil.
2:01:59
This will allow me to come in and actually add information up, update times of an event.
2:02:04
For example, maybe I need to change the week that the meeting's happening on. I can make that update.
2:02:10
You'll notice here, this is a recurring event, so when I make this change, it'll warn me that it's being adjusted When I click on, okay, it will change it.
2:02:17
And if there are other events, because it's recurring, they will also be adjusted for me.
2:02:23
Remember that any additional calendars will show up here over on the left, under other calendars.
2:02:29
This is where you can go to expand and collapse them. Like right now, I have another Google Calendar showing me holidays, which is a default.
2:02:35
If I uncheck it, it would turn off all the United States holidays that are in my calendar. So adding additional calendars, all you have to do is click on this plus sign.
2:02:43
You can go in and create new calendars or browse for calendars that are provided by Google and other providers.
2:02:49
Or you can also import calendars. So there's a lot of opportunities to enlarge what you're seeing inside
2:02:54
this calendar, and it's great to also view other people's calendars. Again, go into your own Google Calendar, create some events.
2:03:01
Look at how you can share your calendar with other people, and then also how easy it is to edit calendar event.
Updating Calendar Settings and Searching Calendars
2:03:11
Welcome back. I need to search my calendar. I also need to view calendar settings. Searching your calendar is really easy because again,
2:03:18
Google is so good at search. If you come to the top right hand corner of the calendar, no matter what view
2:03:23
you're in, you'll see a magnifying glass, which means to look for something. When you click on this, you can type in a keyword, a person, a date,
2:03:31
but to refine your search, make sure you go to the right hand side. You'll see an arrow for search options.
2:03:38
This will take you in to where you can decide what calendars you're looking through, also what you're looking for, any people involved in the calendar,
2:03:46
event, locations, and even dates. When you click on search, it goes through and looks for any events that match that.
2:03:53
And if you click on one event, it'll actually open it up so that you can go into the event card or even edit.
2:03:59
When you're done with your search, you can click on the X to clear it out and then go back and it'll take you back to your calendar.
2:04:05
Now remember, every calendar has settings for the settings of the calendar app itself. Go to the top right hand corner and click on the settings
2:04:13
menu gear and go to settings. This will let you go into the settings of the calendar app.
2:04:18
The other place you can go to get to the settings of a specific calendar are to go down to your My Calendars view.
2:04:25
Go to the calendar in question, go to the vertical ellipses on the side of it, click and then select settings and sharing.
2:04:32
These will take you into the settings for a specific calendar, cuz different calendars can have different time zones and also different features.
2:04:40
So remember, it depends on what setting area you're looking at. Go into your own Google Calendar and look at these areas so you
2:04:47
feel comfortable finding them. Cuz it's important to have your settings in a way that works for you.
Using Google Keep for Notes
2:04:56
Hey, have you ever had a note that you just wanna be able to keep track of that may not relate directly to an email.
2:05:01
It's just like a note to yourself. Well, inside your Google Suite, there's a great little app called Google Keep that I love.
2:05:08
I can use it on my Android or my iPhone and I can also use it on my normal computer To access Google Keep.
2:05:13
You need to go up to your Google App bar and then click on it and come down.
2:05:19
It's Keep, so it's a k. Scroll down until you find, keep, it looks like a little notepad.
2:05:25
When you click on it, it will open in its own browser tab. Now with keep, you're just basically creating electronic sticky notes.
2:05:31
You'll see that at the top there's a place where you can type a note. So right here, notice I have to give my title at the top of my note,
2:05:42
and then I can actually type in the items that I want in my note.
2:05:48
Your notes can have hyperlinks, they can have a lot of different kinds of information in them. In addition, you can actually give your notes different colors.
2:05:56
You can even apply backgrounds to them like this, and you'll also see that inside each note once you create it.
2:06:02
If you come down, you can go back and edit your notes at any time just by clicking on them at the bottom.
2:06:08
You can add images, you can also archive notes, and then there are more options being able to delete a note, even assign a label.
2:06:14
Now, if your note really important, what I recommend is coming to the top right hand corner of the note and pinning it.
2:06:21
That way, it's gonna be favored up here at the top with your important pins. As time goes by, you can unpin a note just by going to the top right hand corner,
2:06:28
clicking on the pin and it unins it and puts it back here under your other ones. Also, if you go to any note and double click on it or click on
2:06:37
it once, it'll open up larger. You can actually share some of your notes with other people that are part of your
2:06:43
Google contacts, and that's why you'll see their initials with their name. Or, for example, this just shows the first letter of their name in the bottom corner,
2:06:51
and it's a great way just to keep track of things that you don't want to forget and it goes with your Google account.
2:06:57
So try it out. Google Keep super easy. Finally, if you need to delete a note, all you wanna do is go to the
2:07:03
note, click on the bottom right hand corner on the ellipses, come in, and you can just click on delete and it will allow you to get rid of it.
Creating and Scheduling Tasks
2:07:15
What about all the stuff you just need to keep track of? We've talked about this a little bit, but there's an awesome app that's also part
2:07:21
of your Google Suite that you get when you sign up for Gmail called Google Tasks. Right now I'm in my inbox and all I need to do to open up my task
2:07:29
list is come to the right hand side below my Google app button. I'll see a blue circle with a blue check mark inside of it.
2:07:37
When I click on this, it opens up my task list. Now I can just have standalone tasks or tasks that I schedule at the top.
2:07:45
I can click on add a task. I'm gonna type in what this is.
2:07:55
Notice that underneath I can enter details, and then also
2:08:02
a date and time when I want to have this task accomplished. I can set the date and then also the time.
2:08:08
Now, this is going to create a scheduled task and I can continue to add more tasks to this list.
2:08:16
What's interesting though, at the top is that if I close this, any task that I've scheduled, like this one that's supposed to happen on the 21st at 10 30.
2:08:25
If I now go up and actually open up my Google calendar, a scheduled task not only gets added to your task list, but if I now come in and look at my calendar on
2:08:34
that day, I'm gonna see that I have a new event that's actually a scheduled task.
2:08:39
When I open it up, I'll see that it's not just an event, it's that task that I just created and notice it's saved in my My Tasks list.
2:08:48
This is the automatic list that's created when you add tasks. By default, you can actually create additional tasks of
2:08:54
your own and even task lists. If I wanted to edit my task, I can click on it. I can come in and even edit, for example, the time that I want it to
2:09:02
happen and the list that it's in. So your tasks also occur not just in your task list, but if they're
2:09:09
scheduled, they show up in your calendar. Now, how would you create a task in the calendar without having to go to your task list?
2:09:16
Go here to the plus sign in your calendar, click on it and notice that you can create new events, but also new tasks.
2:09:22
And it's the same idea, it's just it's a to-do rather than something that's gonna happen.
2:09:29
Notice I can pick the date and time when I want the task to happen, but by default this will be a scheduled task.
2:09:36
So when I click on save, I'll notice that it will be added to my calendar, unlike the other tasks that are just in the list.
2:09:43
Now when it comes to managing your tasks, you're gonna open up your task again, paying over on the right, any task you created, you can
2:09:51
come to the ellipses on the side. This will give you options to create a new task list, create a sub-task, or
2:09:57
even delete a task you no longer need. And if it's deleted from your task list, it will also be
2:10:02
deleted from your calendar. So tasks are just a great way to keep track of the stuff that you need to get done.
Turning Email into Tasks and Starring Tasks
2:10:13
Okay. What about when you get an email and you think, oh, I need to add that to my list of things I need to get done.
2:10:19
Is there a way to take an email and turn it into a task? There is. So I'm in my inbox.
2:10:24
I'm gonna come up and turn on my task pain. And then I'm gonna go in and find the specific email that
2:10:30
I'd like to turn into a task. I'm gonna come in, select the email, and I'm going to left, drag
2:10:36
it to the top of my task pane. Notice it will allow me to left drag and drop it in.
2:10:41
Once I get it there, you'll see that it's creating the task for me. What's great about this task is once it's been added, if I click on it to open it
2:10:48
up, it actually has a link to the email. When I click on this, it will open up the email and take me to it.
2:10:55
I can add additional information, like details of when I wanna get the task completed. I can edit that.
2:11:01
The task will still appear in my task list. Now remember that if you wanna mark a task as complete, you just need
2:11:07
to come over and place a check mark in the circle next to the task. It will mark it as complete and remove it from your list of tasks.
2:11:15
Additionally, you can actually favorite tasks or star them. To do that, you're gonna come to the right hand side of the task,
2:11:22
fill in the Stard task option. It just adds a solid star next to that task.
2:11:27
Now, after tasks have been starred, you'll see that up at the top of your task list, you can actually filter your task list by your starred tasks.
2:11:36
These would kind of be the ones you consider to be most important or pressing. Also, I can come in and I can add a task that will be starred automatically, but by
2:11:44
default, your tasks are organized in the My task view, which includes everything.
2:11:49
And also there is an option to create your own custom list of tasks in addition to the ones that come by default with your Google account.
2:11:57
So, you know, try tasks out. It's really nice that you can go from email to a to-do list in the same
2:12:02
window, and it's really easy to manage.
2:12:08
Hi everyone. Thank you so much for joining us for this second part of our Google Gmail course.
Conclusion
2:12:14
In this course, we've explored some of the additional great features that come with your Google account beyond Gmail.
2:12:20
We've explored the ability to use a chat function from your inbox, and also the collaboration available through a Google space where you can
2:12:27
share files and create group tasks. We've also looked at the Google Meet feature that you can bring into your
2:12:33
Google meetings to add video conferencing. We've also looked at some of the additional apps that come with a
2:12:38
Google account, including the Google Contacts application, which allows you
2:12:43
to keep track of people that you work with every day, and also the Google Calendar where you can keep track of the different events that you're
2:12:50
managing right from your Google account. And remember, all of this follows you wherever you go, all you have to do is
2:12:56
log into your Google account and you have access to all these great features. So thanks again for joining us, and as always, please go in and
2:13:03
try these things out, because when you try them, you're using them. And that's really the pathway to learning to make them part
2:13:09
of the way you work every day.

While most to-do apps try to cram in as
0:02
many features as possible Google Tasks
0:04
takes a refreshingly minimal approach
0:07
with a clean and distraction-free design
0:10
and this is perfect for two types of
0:12
users those who just want to capture and
0:14
track tasks with minimal friction and
0:17
those looking for a seamless integration
0:19
with Google workspace tools and in this
0:22
video I'll go over seven little known
0:24
tips that help you stay organized using
0:26
this underrated app let's get started
Google Tasks Standalone Interface
0:29
all right first off before I found out
0:30
about this hidden feature I would keep
0:32
two Google Calendar Windows pinned in my
0:34
browser because I thought that clicking
0:36
this switch to tasks button was the only
0:39
way to access a standalone Google task
0:41
window on the web although this looks
0:44
fine there is this annoying bug where
0:46
pressing C is supposed to create a new
0:48
task but sometimes it creates a new
0:50
calendar event by mistake and when we
0:52
exit out by pressing escape it goes back
0:55
to the calendar view like Google we're
0:56
not trying to play Russian Roulette here
0:58
so instead we can P this URL in our
1:01
browser I'll leave this in the
1:03
description below and we can now have a
1:06
clean Standalone Google task view on web
1:10
uh zoom in a little bit and we can pin
1:12
this bookm market and most importantly
1:15
this won't revert back to a calendar
1:16
review for no reason now if you're
Add Tasks from Gmail
1:18
anything like me most of your work tasks
1:20
come from emails so from within my Gmail
1:22
inbox I have several options from within
1:25
an email I can press the keyboard
1:27
shortcut shift T to add the email as a
1:30
task in my Google task sidebar and pro
1:33
tip you always want to rename the task
1:35
to start with an action word adopt
1:38
Jeff's new uh email workflow and this is
1:41
a lot more meaningful than whatever the
1:43
default subject line was and after
1:45
assigning a due date don't forget to
1:48
Archive this email by pressing e or
1:50
clicking the archive button up top here
1:53
because remember the same task should
1:55
never exist in two separate locations by
1:57
the way if you really want to master
1:59
email management I've got a complete
2:01
task zero for Gmail system over at my
2:04
workspace Academy I'll leave a link down
2:06
below back to our inbox with the task
2:08
sidebar open we can also drag emails
2:12
over to the task list as well or select
2:15
multiple emails and click the add to
2:17
task button up top to add multiple
2:19
emails as tasks and of course from
2:22
within our gmao mobile app we can press
2:24
the three dots and click add two tasks
2:27
from here the best part about this
2:29
workflow is that all the emails are
2:31
linked within the task so if I were to
2:34
click that link for example from our
2:35
Standalone task list um the email is
2:38
opened up in a clean Standalone window
2:41
so that after I deal with it I can close
2:43
a window and I'm not sucked back into my
2:46
email inbox next up in keeping with the
Add Tasks from Google Chat
2:48
theme of Google Tasks deep integration
2:51
with Google workspace I absolutely love
2:53
how I can send any message from a Google
2:56
chat conversation to my task list by
2:58
clicking the three dots add to tasks and
3:01
of course this works on both web and
3:03
mobile when I'm commuting or eating
3:05
lunch I receive a request over chat I
3:07
can't properly respond to it right then
3:09
and there and I also don't want to
3:10
forget about it so the most efficient
3:12
thing to do is to send it to my task
3:15
list and deal with it when I'm back at
3:17
my desktop now if you're passive
3:19
aggressive which I'm obviously not I
3:21
deal with conflict so well I'm like the
3:22
best at dealing with conflict um from
3:24
within a group chat in Google Chat we
3:27
can add a task within the group at a due
3:30
date and after assigning someone as the
3:33
owner the corresponding task will appear
3:36
in their task list which again I would
3:39
never do because I'm a mature and
3:40
grownup professional and I would never
3:42
avoid confrontation regardless of what
3:45
my performance review
3:47
says Pro tip from within the group tasks
3:50
view we can choose manual sort sort by
3:53
date or my preferred sort in this
3:55
specific situation sort by a s or owner
3:59
by the way if you're enjoying these
4:00
practical tips you can join my free
4:02
newsletter to receive an insanely
4:04
actionable Google workspace tip every
4:06
week link down below moving on from
Tasks x Calendar Workflow
4:08
within Google Calendar first make sure
4:11
the tasks view is enabled under my
4:14
calendars and when it comes to the
4:16
workflow there are two ways to go about
4:18
this and honestly it comes down to
4:20
personal preference option one you first
4:22
add visible blocks on your calendar like
4:25
deep work so your colleagues know not to
4:27
disturb you and on top of that you add
4:29
add time specific tasks to remind
4:32
yourself of the work you need to
4:33
complete option two you capture tasks as
4:37
all day tasks by default and assign a
4:39
due date then during your daily inbox
4:42
review sessions I'll talk about this in
4:44
a bit you review upcoming tasks create
4:47
calendar blocks for those tasks and
4:49
check them off your task list I
4:51
personally prefer option two just
4:53
because it's more flexible and honestly
4:55
we should be reviewing our tasks
4:57
throughout the day anyways I talk about
4:59
that a lot more in the workspace Academy
5:01
so check that out if you want next let's
Google Tasks Sidebar
5:03
talk about Google Tasks biggest unfair
5:05
advantage over other to-do apps the
5:08
Google sidebar when you're in the flow
5:10
of work in Gmail drive or even Google
5:13
Slides capturing tasks is just one click
5:17
away Pro tip from within Google Docs
5:20
free users can rely on the sidebar as
5:23
normal to add tasks but Google workspace
5:25
business users can create a checkbox
5:28
left bracket right bracket space type
5:31
the action item and assign tasks right
5:34
from the document itself which is a game
5:36
Cher for project meetings the reason I'm
5:39
making such a big deal about the sidebar
5:41
is that if we could capture tasks the
5:43
instant we think of them I.E reduce
5:46
friction to zero we never forget
5:49
anything and the sidebar takes us one
5:51
step closer to that dream scenario while
5:54
we're here a few more things to keep in
5:56
mind I like to sort my tasks by due date
5:59
to stay chronological I stick with just
6:01
using one master task list to avoid
6:04
context switching and for repeating
6:07
tasks the only way to delete them is
6:09
Click Three Dots and delete all
Google Tasks’ Mobile Workflow
6:12
occurrences whether you're an Android or
6:14
iPhone user I highly recommend adding a
6:16
Google task widget right on your main
6:18
home screen so that you can add tasks
6:20
with just two clicks one to add a task
6:23
and second to assign a due date although
6:25
we mainly focused on the web version in
6:27
this video I'd say 70 to 80% of my tasks
6:30
are captured through the mobile app
6:31
since new ideas usually hit me at the
6:33
gym during my commute or when I'm trying
6:36
really hard to fall asleep all right
Create Tasks from Google Gemini
6:38
last and well maybe least we can create
6:41
tasks through Google Gemini from within
6:43
the web app we can type at tasks select
6:45
Google task uh create a task uh bring
6:49
gift into office
6:52
tomorrow and the action item will be
6:55
added to our task list quick heads up
6:58
you need to make sure your gem time zone
7:00
matches that of your Google Calendars
7:02
because there's currently a bug where
7:03
tasks created in Gemini follows your
7:06
Gemini time zone instead of your Google
7:08
Calendars also if you don't see the
7:10
Google task option head on over to
7:12
settings extensions and make sure your
7:15
Google workspace extension is turned on
7:18
this is available to free and paid users
7:21
and yes I totally agree using Gemini on
7:23
the web to create task is unproductive
7:25
but through the Gemini mobile app we can
7:28
enable voice commands and through
7:30
natural language describe the task and
7:33
tell Gemini when the due date should be
Bonus Tip
7:35
bonus tip for Google workspace users I
7:38
know it's tempting to capture tasks
7:40
ideas and thoughts all in Google Tasks
7:42
but trust me when I tell you I've made
7:44
this mistake it gets way too messy and
7:46
disorganized instead make sure to only
7:49
capture action items in Google Tasks
7:51
since those always have a due date and
7:53
ideas thoughts and quicknotes should be
7:56
captured in Google Keep where we can add
7:58
labels and include more context again if
8:02
you want to learn my entire workflow
8:03
check out the workspace Academy if you
8:05
enjoyed these tips check out my
8:06
workspace playlist next see you on the
8:08
next video in the
8:09
meantime have a great one

2025 have been Google's year in AI. They started slow, but then they hit their
0:05
stride. And now Gemini is going punch for punch at the top tier with updates
0:10
coming fast and getting better each time. Cuz reality is when Google
0:16
commits, it never stays in one app. It gets integrated across their products
0:21
and you truly feel it in your day-to-day tools. And for that reason, I've put
0:26
together an end-to-end tutorial for you on how to use the Gemini application. And because I respect your time, I will
0:32
highlight the topics that we'll cover in the video, so you can skip ahead if you're here for something specific. If
0:37
we haven't met before, I'm Ali Salam and I currently work as a director in a tech company. And on this channel, I'll help
0:43
you turn tech and finance into your personal advantage.
Foundations: UI, sidebar, chat, models
0:52
Here we have Gemini. And this likely looks very familiar to you if you've used Chat GPT or any other AI. You have
0:58
the chat in the middle, which is where you interact with the AI. You have historical chats in the sidebar to the
1:04
left, as well as your gems, which we'll cover later in the video. What makes Gemini really special in comparison to a
1:11
lot of the other AIS is its native integration into the Google Workspace. And honestly, I cannot overstate this.
1:18
If you are natively working in Gmail, Google spreadsheets or presentations and
1:23
you're not using Gemini already, this will be a gamecher for you. And look,
1:29
there are many ways that you can access the workspace function. But the easiest way to do it is literally just to do an
1:35
at and then it will kind of call off any of the tools that are connected. So if you for example want to set up a
1:41
meeting, you can select Google calendar and you can say schedule a meeting at
1:49
1600 tomorrow for deep work. And if you fire this away, it will call the
1:57
calendar tool and actually set up the meeting for you. Here we go. And if you
2:02
want to recall anything within your Google calendar, you literally just do the same. So you can say
2:08
at Google calendar when do I have my deep work session tomorrow. And there we
2:16
go. I won't go through all the things you can do in the Google Workspace because that is a beast of its own and
2:21
definitely out of scope for this video. But the key takeaway is that if you want to use Gemini to its fullest, then you
2:27
need to make sure to leverage the Google Workspace integration because even though most of the other AI tools can do
2:33
something like this, it is not even remotely as close to being this smooth. Now, if we move on to the models, you
2:40
can click the little button down here and you'll see two models. You have a fast model and the reasoning model
2:46
Gemini 3, which is the latest model at the time of this recording. And I would recommend you to always keep the
2:52
reasoning model on because unlike many of the other reasoning models, it has a variable called thinking level which
2:59
kind of determines the effort associated with the prompt and automatically tunes the model's effort based on it. So lower
3:06
complexity tasks will go quicker whereas complex tasks will take a bit more time. Lastly, I just want to talk about
3:14
Gemini's ability to consume data. It's multimodal, meaning that you can feed it pictures, documents, Excel sheets,
3:20
videos, or even code. You either do that by drag and dropping the files that you want to use into the chat, or you can
3:27
type directly into the chat. You can, of course, also add the files by clicking the plus button down here, and then you
3:32
would pick the source where your files currently sits that you want to kind of import into Gemini. Furthermore,
3:39
Google's context window is crazy big. It can consume up to 1 million tokens
3:45
within your prompt. And that means that you could essentially put multiple books into the chat and ask Gemini to action
3:51
it, which is pretty wild. And from here, we're going to start taking a look at the tools section down here. There is
3:58
some really cool stuff in there. So, let's get going.
Deep Research (web + your files + optional Workspace sources)
4:05
So you may or may not have heard about deep research before but let me tell you
4:11
deep research in Gemini hits differently. So what most deep research capability out there does today is that
4:18
it kind of goes to the web searches for a set of credible resources and then compiles a report for you which is
4:24
really good. But let's now take a look at what Gemini does which is an enhanced version of that. So if we start off by
4:31
opening the deep research on the tools here, you can instantly see that in your sources, you can indeed pick the web
4:37
search as a source, but you can also use the Gmail, the drive, and the chat as
4:43
sources, allowing you to use a much more precise set of data inputs. But that's not it. You can also drop files in here,
4:51
and that allows you to use this super powerful deep research capability in a very directed manner. So I have a very
4:58
famous report here from McKenzie looks like this covering the state of AI in
5:04
2025. If you haven't read this, you definitely should because it is really cool. And what we can do is to use that
5:10
report as our input data point for the deep research. Now let's upload that file into Gemini and let's do a gap
5:17
analysis to see what they potentially might have missed in the report. Now the way we want to do that is obviously
5:23
we've dropped this in. You could of course have just uh clicked files, navigated over to your file directory
5:28
where you have this setting and and clicked that, but I dragged and dropped it. And then we want to toggle on some
5:35
benchmark data. So what I will do here is I will let search be toggled on. So
5:42
what Gemini will now do is kind of look at the report and then compare the report against other data sources to see
5:49
if it can identify some elements that might have been missed in the report. Now, I'm going to drop my prompt in that
5:55
I have pre-prepared. I won't bug you down with uh covering the contents of
6:00
the prompt, but what I'll do is I will leave it in the description and in the pinned comment at the top for
6:06
convenience. All right, let's fire this away. And by the way, if you were to do this exercise for some internal task in
6:13
your company, then you should of course toggle on the sources in here where you
6:19
have your file sitting. So if your company works in drives for example then that would be a good source to toggle on
6:25
here when you're doing this type of exercise. Now we can see here that Google deep research as it always does
6:31
outlines the exact steps that it's going to take before executing the research. Now you can edit the plan if you want to
6:37
do that. If you look at the steps outlined here and you go like nope that doesn't line up with what I was hoping for it to do then click this button over
6:44
here. But to me this looks like it's directionally correct. So I'm just going to allow it to start the research. Okay.
6:50
Okay, so we can see that the gap analysis report has finished and it's built it in a very common structure. So
6:55
it's starting off with an executive summary outlining the key takeaways from the report and then it goes into the
7:01
specific chapters where it breaks down each topic at hand. Now typically what I would have expected in a report like
7:08
this is for Gemini to have put out a table outlining the key gaps that it has
7:15
identified, but it doesn't seem to have done that here. Let's scroll down and
7:20
see what else it has external benchmarks in it. So here we can see that it has started to take a swipe at the Mckenzie
7:26
report. So the energy and sustainability crisis the gap the PDF contains zero references to energy consumption,
7:32
electricity shortages, nuclear power or the environmental impact of AI scaling and then it breaks that down further.
7:40
And then we have shadow AI and the dissolution of the perimeter etc. So you get the point. It kind of
7:46
breaks it down and honestly seems to highlight a couple of very interesting points in here. And by the way, if you
7:52
haven't read that report and you are into AI, I would highly recommend you to do it. It is one of the biggest reports
7:59
on AI that came out this year. Okay. The last thing I just wanted to show you on
8:04
the deep research capability is now that you actually have the report, you have notebookm capabilities attached at the
8:12
top here, which basically allows you to create a web page on it. You can build up some infographics. You can run
8:18
quizzes and flashcards if you're trying to learn the contents of the report. Or you can have an audio overview which
8:24
allows you to listen to this report as a podcast which is really cool because it allows you to digest a report that
8:30
contains a lot of complexity in your preferred medium of consumption.
Gems: build a reusable mini-expert
8:39
Think of gems as your personal mini experts that you can save and trigger whenever you want to. And they're
8:45
actually really simple to build. All you do is click the gem section up here and
8:51
it will bring you into the gem manager and you can see my old gems down here and you can create new gems by clicking
8:57
the button here. You have four inputs. You have a name of the gem. You have the
9:03
description of the gem and then comes the important part. This is the instruction. So here is where you tell
9:09
the gem what to do. Lastly, you have a field called knowledge here at the bottom where you can add files for
9:15
reference when the gem is firing off. And once you have done this, you can click save and you can also try it out
9:22
as a preview in the right hand side field here. But instead of building up a new one, let's just look at one of my
9:28
previous gems. So we can use this executive gem. I'll just click edit here
9:33
and you can see how it looks from the inside. So obviously the name is then executive gem. The description is that
9:38
it turns text into executive style briefs and the instruction covers what
9:43
the gem should actually do. So you can see here that I've given a role executive communication specialist and
9:49
the task at hand is to take any input text and transform it into a concise,
9:54
polished and executive style brief. And then you have a set of guidelines down here. And really this is all it does.
10:02
Let's use a cute example here. Tell me the story of Little Red Riding Hood. So,
10:09
we're asking it to give us the story of uh Children Tail, but it's going to use
10:15
the instructions in the gem to produce the executive outline. So, as you can
10:20
see here, it started off with subject, operational, postmortem, logistics,
10:26
security, breach, and asset recovery. All right, this is going to be the best
10:31
version of Little Red Riding Hood you've ever seen. So, we have the executive summary again, uh, context, problem,
10:39
analysis, resolution. So, you get the point. It can basically take any input
10:44
and turn it into an executive brief. Now, this essentially means that you have a little mini expert that you can
10:51
trigger anytime you want to create an executive brief on whatever topic that you're working on. And anytime you
10:57
trigger the gem, you will end up having a separate chat that you can continue working on. So you can see here little
11:03
red riding hood security something. So if you want to continue working on this executive brief, you have the ability to
11:08
do so. Quick pause. I have a favor to ask. If you're enjoying the video so far, you should consider becoming a part
11:15
of a small but very exclusive group of around 5% of viewers that have
11:22
subscribed. And if you've already subscribed, I just want to say thank you. You're the reason why this channel
11:29
keeps growing and keeps getting better.
Video (Veo 3.1) & Images (Nano Banana): generate a marketing ready material
11:38
Now, when it comes to video and image generation, Google provides some of the best tools out there. And a lot of
11:44
people even say that Google are leading in this space. So, let's start off with video generation. In Gemini, the video
11:51
generation is powered by VO3.1, which generates high-quality video with
11:56
sound. Now, let's try that out by creating a marketing video for a hypothetical cafe. And you would do that
12:02
by clicking tools, and then you select create video. And you can see here that it's highlighting VO3.1, which is the
12:07
latest model at the time of this recording. And then you describe your video. So, I will dump my prompt in
12:14
here. And again, I'll spare you the time of going through it, but I'll share all of this in the description and pin it in
12:21
the comment. And then all you do is fire it away. All right, here we go.
12:36
Okay. So, it's not bad. It actually followed the prompt fairly well. It gave
12:41
us three sequences, right? So I gave it a zero to 2.5 second sequence. Micro
12:47
shot of coffee steam rising over a cup. Followed that fairly well. And then we had a second shot. And then we had a
12:53
third shot. Now I did notice that it did not say stock of Sweden, but
13:01
instead it said, let's take a look here. Stock.
13:06
Now I don't know where that is, but I would like to go there. When it comes to images, let's pop open a new chat.
13:13
Gemini can both create images that are stunning, but then it can also edit
13:19
pictures using Nano Banana Pro. And it's doing that extremely well. So, let's say that we wanted to build a menu for our
13:26
cafe and stock. Then you would need to again go into tools and then click create images. You
13:33
can see that they've even tagged this functionality with a banana for nano banana. And then we'll drop in our
13:39
prompt again. I'll share this and let's fire it away. Here we go. This looks
13:45
pretty good, right? Let me show you the ability of Nana Banana. If we just want to edit this picture, let's say switch
13:53
the theme to forest green. All right, here we go again. This is why
14:00
Nano Banana is amazing. Context continuity for video and image generation has been an issue across the
14:07
board when it comes to AI generated content. But as you can see here, it literally just switched the color theme
14:14
of the menu, but the rest stayed the same. We still have the same format of the menu. We still have the same menu
14:21
elements. It's still Nordic winter latte, fireside, flat white, etc. Which,
14:27
by the way, looks like a really well marketed menu, right? Nordic Winter Lot. This sounds amazing. But the point is
14:34
that it basically kept all the elements of the menu. We can shift back into the old one here. It just switched the
14:41
color. The rest stayed the same. What this means for you is that you can keep
14:47
iterating and keep enhancing an image until you're happy with it without having to worry too much. I won't say
14:54
that your worry should be completely gone because it still messes it up sometimes, but generally speaking, it's
15:00
doing this extremely well and that is why Nana Banana Pro is getting so much hype because it's just really good.
Canva (Iterative Improvement)
15:10
So the next capability is Canva which is essentially a built-in workspace in
15:15
Gemini where you can take a prompt and turn it into a real output like a document, slide style content, study
15:23
guide, or even a simple web page. And the reason why it's so useful is that it
15:28
keeps everything structured and editable. So you can essentially iterate on a draft similar to what you would do
15:34
in Google Docs or Word or any of the other corporate tools that you're likely using today, but you don't have to
15:40
regenerate a new message or a new chat every time you want to make an edit. So I have another report again from
15:46
McKenzie. I'm not affiliated with Mckenzie. It's just ended up being that these are the two reports that I picked
15:51
for this episode. And this report is on the state of grocery retail in 2025. So
15:56
they did this together with Eurocommerce and it was a fairly interesting report to read through. Nevertheless, let's
16:03
drop that in and let's toggle on canvas under tools and we can simply say
16:09
generate me an HTML dashboard outlining
16:16
the key takeaways of the content in this
16:21
report. open the simulation as a preview directly in the app. Here
16:30
we go. So, it has built out a dashboard for us. Starts off with an executive summary followed by a set of key data
16:38
points and then it has kind of structured the dashboard into various
16:43
elements that summarizes the content of the report and it looks pretty good.
16:48
Now, let's say that we wanted to adjust this dashboard a little bit and perhaps take this section here with nine key
16:55
trends for 2025 plus and dig a little bit deeper into it. So, what we can do
17:01
is just take that and say build out a separate tab for for the section.
17:12
Each element should contain a dropdown
17:18
tab with further detail. And this is the cool part with Canva
17:24
that you can just keep iterating like this, keep enhancing. And there is actually a button on the right hand side
17:30
here which is grayed out because it's um it's currently rebuilding the dashboard. But this button allows Gemini to kind of
17:38
tap into the dashboard and suggest edit enhancements. itself. Here we can see
17:44
the updated version. So now there is a separate tab for deep dive. The rest looks fairly coherent to what it looked
17:50
before and it seems like it has added a button down here that takes you to the second tab. But let's shift gear and
17:57
take a look at how it constructed up this uh this new section. So again, we have nine key trends. It has the drop
18:03
down with some further detail inside of it. Why does this matter to you? Well, if you're building out a report and you
18:10
want to skip the whole shuffle of going back and forth in the chat and just keep working iteratively on an output like
18:17
this, then Canva is going to be a great choice for you to execute that type of work.
Guided Learning (scaffolded learning on long PDFs)
18:27
All right, guided learning is obviously really great if you're studying or
18:32
trying to learn something on the side, but it's also really useful if you, like
18:38
me, work in corporate, which I know a lot of you watching are doing. So, let's
18:43
say that you get sent a corporate document, a long PDF containing a lot of
18:49
information that you need to learn by heart for a presentation or a Q&A, or let's just say that you want to absorb
18:55
or digest that content with more ease and without having to spend as much time
19:00
doing it. What you can then do is take that report. Let's say that we got sent
19:05
this state of AI report that we looked at earlier in the video. You drop that
19:11
in here and then you turn on guided learning under tools and then you can
19:16
just say I need to quickly understand the key concepts of this report.
19:24
Where do I start? All right. So what you can see that Gemini is doing here is it says let's explore the report together.
19:32
The central theme here is a massive gap between adoption and scaling. was giving you a short introduction paragraph here
19:37
and then this is key to help you get a handle of the key concepts. Where should you where would you like to start and
19:43
you can now pick one of the three main areas of the report that you can dig further into. Now the reason why I think
19:51
this is pretty interesting is because a common but very strong presentation
19:56
technique that is especially useful when discussing complex topics is something called scaffolded learning. And the core
20:03
principle is fairly simple and you can actually see it being applied here. The idea is that you start with a very
20:10
simple approach. Allow the audience to feel like they're following you as you gradually increase complexity. And you
20:17
can leverage the same concept in Gemini. If you say like I did here, where do I
20:23
start? Or you can also say like explain this like I'm five, the famous movie quote, you would effectively be
20:29
triggering the scaffolded learning. And at the same time, if you want a specific
20:35
detail in the report, you can of course go straight into that as well. It's not by any mean, shape, or form fine-tuned
20:42
to always use scaffolded learning, but rather it will adapt accordingly if you
20:47
want something specific out of a report. So, let's say that we were to pick one of these. Let's say the rise of the AI
20:54
agents. Let's go with 2. Then you will see that Gemini keeps unfolding further
20:59
information and dive deeper into more and more complexity as you decide where
21:05
you want to delve deeper and it will always prompt you with a next step. So you can see here to help you get a
21:11
better grip on this which aspect would you like to explore next and it gives you the three options. So you kind of
21:16
just need to tag along here and Gemini will basically do the hard work for you. And by the way, you don't have to use a
21:23
report like I did. That's just a pretty good corporate use case for those of you that are interested in that. You could
21:29
basically ask whatever in the chat, turn on guided learning, and Gemini will start training you on that topic.
Visual Layout: rich, magazine-style explanations
21:40
The visual layout feature transforms standard text into rich magazine style
21:46
pages with images, cards, and interactive widgets as opposed to kind of giving you the standard wall of text
21:53
that we always get in the chat. Common use cases would be exploring complex topics or more casual things like travel
21:59
planning, shopping, comparison, or recipes. Let's say that you wanted to pick a more complex topic like learning
22:08
how large language models work. All you would need to do is go into tools again,
22:14
toggle on visual layouts, and then you could prompt explain how large language
22:22
models LLM work to a nontechnical
22:29
audience using a visual guide. Now we fire that away. All right, here we go.
22:36
Large language models, a word prediction machine. So you can see kind of these uh interactive uh pictures that are
22:43
toggling through. So it says here that imagine an LLM as a highly sophisticated autocomplete function.
22:51
Dude, you're not selling yourself very well, are you? It doesn't truly understand the way humans does, but it
22:58
analyzed patterns in billions of pages of text. For those of you that don't know, the way LLMs basically work is
23:05
that it's a statistical model that guesses the next word in the sequence. And then it basically further down here
23:11
says that there are three core steps of an LLM. So step one is training, step two is the tokenization, and step three
23:16
is the prediction. And because I have fat fingers, I decided to click on step one. And it started compiling the next
23:25
steps, which is fine. I plan to show you that later. But let's just jump back
23:31
here for a second. The important part here is that you get a structured output
23:36
telling you how LLMs work. Now, this could of course have come in a chat as well, but this is a little bit more easy
23:44
and fun to digest than a wall of text. And what it always does is give you a
23:51
set of suggestions on what to explore further. So here it suggested bias and
23:56
ethics, retrieval, augmented generation, which you probably heard me harp about a couple of times if you are not a
24:02
first-time listener, etc. And if you were to click any of these, it would then build out the next response. Now
24:08
what I did is I clicked step one up here. So the training and now it has
24:13
compiled the next element of this visual layout which is around training. And you
24:18
can see here that it outlines three phases of LLM training, which is data cleaning, then pre-training, and lastly
24:24
fine-tuning. So the key thing to take away here is that if you prefer this
24:29
type of output when you are chatting with Gemini, then you can just turn on visual layout and you'll get it in this
24:36
format instead.
Scheduled Actions: weekly AI update automation
24:43
scheduled actions works very similar to the way chatbt does it in case you have
24:48
tried it over there. So let's just jump straight into it. In the chat all you
24:53
need to do is basically tell Gemini to set it up for you. So let's for example
24:59
say create a weekly scheduled action
25:05
every Monday at CT. send me a summary of
25:11
the latest AI updates from past week. And that's it. You just fire it away and
25:19
Gemini will set that up for you. And there we go. So basically what's going to happen now is that every Monday at
25:26
8:00 my time, it will create a summary for me based on the latest news in the
25:32
AI space and give me a notification that that has happened. So if you for example
25:38
have the app downloaded on your phone then it's going to give you a notification and you will also see it in
25:44
the left hand side here. You can actually see one of my um one of my other scheduled tasks which fired off
25:51
earlier today and you can of course always come back into this chat and turn it off. You can edit it here as well.
25:58
But it will of course be quite painful to try and find a very old chat if you
26:05
for example have had a scheduled action laying around for a while. So there's a better way of doing that which is to go
26:12
down to the settings and then there is a tab here called scheduled actions. So
26:17
you just go in there and you will see all of your actions listed. And from
26:22
here you can either toggle them on and off like this. You can go in and adjust
26:27
the details of it. And of course, if you just want to take it out completely, you have the delete button down here.
Prompt engineering (how to get better output)
26:39
All right, this wouldn't be a tutorial if we didn't talk prompting best practices. So, let's just quickly cover
26:44
that off. For Gemini 3 Pro, which I recommend you to use instead of the fast
26:50
model, it's fairly simple. It's a reasoning model meaning that you should treat it more as a kind of senior
26:56
colleague rather than a junior colleague which your standard chat models like chat GP5 would be considered as. That
27:03
means that you need to focus less on how it executes a task and focus more on what it should achieve. Now Google are
27:10
outlining three points that are important to be aware of when you're using Gemini 3 Pro. So the first is to
27:17
be concise in your input prompts. So it says Gemini 3 responds best to direct
27:22
clear instructions. It may overanalyze verbose or overly complex prompt engineering techniques used for odal
27:28
models. And this is very important to be aware of because with normal chat
27:34
models, the general rule of thumb is the more context the better. But that actually confuses a reasoning model.
27:41
Keep it short and to the point. The second thing is output verbosity. The
27:46
key takeaway here is that Gemini 3 is by default less verbose and prefers providing direct efficient answers. And
27:53
that basically means that if you want it to be more elaborative around the topic, you need to tell it to do so. So it
27:59
basically says here, if your use case requires a more conversational or chatty persona, you must explicitly steer the
28:05
model in the prompt. Eg explain this as a friendly talkative assistant. Now, if you're like me and prefer the model to
28:11
get to the point, then it's just good to know that this is the way it works. But you don't actually need to do anything about it. In fact, you can actually
28:18
prompt it to be even more direct if you prefer that. I tend to do that, by the way. And the last thing to be aware of
28:24
here is around the context management. So basically, the key takeaway here is that when you're working with a large
28:30
data set, you should place your specific instruction or question at the end of the prompt after the data context. And
28:38
that is typically very different to how we have looked at prompt engineering for all the previous models where the task
28:46
typically comes first or second if you have a persona but it's basically at the
28:52
top of your prompt. And here it's essentially telling you to put it at the bottom and instead focus on the context
28:58
management. But all in all the key takeaway here is you don't need to
29:04
overcontextualize when working with Gemini 3. It's really less is more.
Key settings that actually matter
29:12
Now, the last thing I want to leave you with is some important settings to be aware of. So, the settings you'll find
29:17
down here. And the first one, and probably one of the most important ones, is your baseline instructions for
29:24
Gemini. So, if you click that, you can basically tell it to apply an
29:30
instruction every time you talk to Gemini. Now, I have one, but you can have multiple ones. And the way you add
29:37
them is by clicking the add button at the top. And you can delete everything that you have on the button here. And
29:43
then you can toggle them on and off using the slider at the top here. So
29:48
mine looks like this. It's basically my preferred way of uh interacting with
29:54
Gemini. Be concise, direct, and mei. We just looked at the um prompt engineering
29:59
principles for Gemini 3. It is already very concise, but I like my responses to be even more concise. and then basically
30:06
outlining a set of rules and guidelines that I wanted to abide by as we are
30:11
talking and it goes through this instruction every time we talk. So I would highly recommend you to put your
30:17
version in and I'll share mine in case you want to copy the one I'm using. The second important setting are the apps
30:24
and the apps are essentially the way for Gemini to pull information in context. So, in the beginning of this video, I
30:31
showed you how I pulled information and sent information through Google Calendar. That is because it's connected
30:38
via this this button here. So, you can go into this space and just add your workspace in if you want to leverage the
30:44
Google Workspace when you use Gemini. And then you have a set of other integrations available for you. So, you
30:49
have GitHub at the top here. You have YouTube Music and Synth ID at the
30:55
bottom. But as you can imagine, the most important one is going to be your Google Workspace. All right, moving on to the
31:02
next one. Schedule tasks we covered just uh just now. Then you have something called your public links. If we were to
31:08
go into one of our chats, let's say that we use this older chat where we talked about how LLMs work and we want to share
31:15
this, then we would click at share, this little logo down here, and it will create a link for us. So let's say that
31:21
we now have this public chat that anyone with this link is able to access. If you
31:28
go into your public links, that chat now appears. So you will have a list of all
31:35
your chats that is publicly available through the link. And this allows you to
31:40
both remove chats that you no longer use as well as find the the link in case you
31:47
want to reshare it. And again, you have the ability to delete all links at the top here. Now, the last thing I want to
31:53
show you is the theme. As you've noticed, my Gemini is dark. That is actually because I have recently
31:59
switched computer and my new computer is set to a dark theme by default. So, even
32:06
though this one is set to system, it just picks up that my system settings uh is geared towards a dark theme. Hence,
32:13
Gemini is dark too. But usually when you fire up Gemini, it will look like this.
32:19
So it's just a preference. I personally think that dark theme is easier on the
32:25
eyes. So I like to go with this. But I also know that some of you prefer to
32:30
have a light theme because it's easier to read the text. Just go for the one that floats your boat. And now you've learned how to use Gemini. I hope this
32:38
video was of value to you. Let me know if it was and let me know if it wasn't
32:44
because this channel is for you. So, your feedback really matters. Now, if
32:49
you want to continue your learning path in the Google ecosystem, I will point you to this video over here, which is
32:56
another tutorial this time on Notebook LM, which is another Google product. And
33:01
if you haven't heard about it before, it's kind of fine-tuned to draw insights
33:07
from your documents with the lowest possible hallucination. And by the way, it uses Gemini as the underlying AI
33:14
model to do that. As always, thank you for trusting me with your time. And
33:20
have a good one.

hi guys almost everyone uses Gmail
0:03
especially working people but not to its
0:06
full potential well that ends today
0:08
we're gonna see my favorite tips and
0:10
tricks in gmail which will help you keep
0:11
your emails organized and increase your
0:14
productivity I'm Brandt website Learners
0:16
and let's see my top 12 tips and tricks
0:18
to increase your productivity in Gmail
0:20
the first trick is filtering unwanted
0:23
emails let's say you received too many
Filtering unwanted emails
0:25
promotion newsletters and it is
0:27
distracting you from focusing on
0:29
important emails now want to filter all
0:31
the newsletters in my Gmail so refill to
0:33
the newsletters let's go to our inbox
0:35
but how do you know which emails and
0:37
newsletters it's simple almost all the
0:40
newsletters will have the unsubscribe
0:42
button for example let's open newsletter
0:46
and you can see we have an unsubscribe
0:49
button here now if your email does not
0:51
have one at the top just scroll down and
0:53
as you can see it has the unsubscribe
0:55
button at the end
0:57
so to filter all the newsletters I can
0:59
filter all the emails that have the word
1:01
unsubscribe as it will be present in all
1:03
newsletter emails Now to create the
1:05
filter just click here
1:08
and here we need to enter the word using
1:11
which the emails will be filtered
1:14
so let's enter And subscribe
1:16
so now if you click search
1:18
you can just see the promotional emails
1:20
now if you want to keep any email you
1:23
can modify your search go to doesn't
1:24
have
1:26
and include whichever brand that you
1:28
want to include here
1:30
and once you have done this click create
1:32
filter
1:35
and here you can select the options
1:36
based on your need so if you don't want
1:38
to receive the newsletters in your inbox
1:40
you can select this option
1:43
and select Mark as read
1:45
next if you want to get these emails
1:47
into a separate folder you can use this
1:49
option so let's click here
1:52
and select new label
1:55
here you can enter the label name you
1:57
want
1:58
so I'm going to enter newsletter and
2:00
click create
2:02
and you can see that the label has been
2:04
created now all the filtered emails will
2:06
be present inside this label next here
2:09
select this option to apply these
2:11
settings for all similar emails
2:14
once you're done click create filter
2:18
and as you can see our filter has been
2:21
successfully created so now all the
2:23
emails with the word unsubscribe will
2:25
not show up in your inbox and instead it
2:28
will be available under this label and
2:29
when you click on it
2:32
you can see the promotional emails okay
2:35
now other than newsletters what are some
2:38
important emails also have the
2:40
unsubscribe button too so for example as
Avoid filtering important emails
2:43
you can see this is an email with the
2:45
OTP needed for our login but if you see
2:47
here it also has the unsubscribe link so
2:50
important emails like this will also be
2:52
moved to the newsletter and you will not
2:54
receive them in your inbox and you might
2:56
end up missing important updates so for
2:59
important emails like this you can copy
3:01
the email ID and add it to the exception
3:03
list now the emails in the exception
3:05
list will not be filtered even if they
3:07
have the word unsubscribe so just click
3:09
here
3:11
copy this email address
3:16
then click the gear icon
3:20
and click see all settings
3:22
here go to filters and blocked addresses
3:26
and you can see the filter we have
3:28
created just click edit
3:30
and here you need to enter the emails
3:32
which you don't want to be filtered so
3:34
let's paste the email which we copied
3:35
earlier
3:37
similarly enter all the emails which you
3:39
don't want to be filtered
3:41
and click continue
3:43
now here select this to apply this
3:45
setting for all matching emails
3:47
and click update filter
3:50
you can see our filter has been updated
3:53
now if we receive any email from the
3:55
same email ID we'll distribute in our
3:57
inbox and it will not be filtered in
3:59
newsletters so let's go to the inbox
4:03
and as you can see we have received a
4:05
new email in our inbox let's open it
4:09
you can see it's the same mail that we
4:11
don't want to be filtered with
4:12
newsletters so this is how you can
4:14
create a filter to hide unwanted
4:16
newsletters from your inbox now what if
4:18
you wanted to create a filter for
4:19
particular email addresses alone for
4:22
example just open an email now let's say
4:24
you want to filter all the emails
Create filter for particular email address
4:26
received from this email and future
4:28
emails all you need to do is just click
4:30
here
4:32
and click filter messages like these
4:36
if you click search
4:38
you can only see the emails received
4:39
from this address now to create the
4:41
filter click here
4:44
and click create filter
4:46
now to start these emails just enable
4:48
this option
4:50
and every time you receive an email
4:51
which matches this address it will be
4:53
start
4:54
now again click create filter
4:57
so this is how you can filter particular
4:59
mail IDs okay the next trick is a
5:02
lifesaver if you have to go through
5:04
multiple emails a day yes the second tip
5:07
will help you quickly get through your
5:08
emails without leaving your inbox Now by
5:11
default if we try to open an email you
5:13
can see it takes the entire page and to
5:16
open another email you have to go back
5:18
and only then you can open another email
5:20
but once you enable the reading pane
5:22
option you can read your emails like
5:25
this without leaving your inbox and
5:27
switch between multiple emails quickly
Get through your emails without leaving your inbox
5:29
so to enable it just click the gear icon
5:33
scroll down until you find the reading
5:35
panel section here you can select where
5:37
you want to see the email content I am
5:39
going to select right of the inbox
5:42
now Gmail ask you to reload so just
5:44
reload
5:46
and you can see we have got a new
5:48
section here just select any email you
5:51
want to read
5:52
and you can see we can see the email
5:54
content without leaving our inbox this
5:57
way we can go through our emails faster
6:00
okay next let's go to the third trick
6:02
which is to use grammarly now Google's
6:05
own spell checker will only check for
6:07
spelling mistakes and not Grammar
6:09
mistakes but grammarly can analyze the
6:11
entire text within seconds and provide
6:14
suggestions for both grammar and
6:15
spelling mistakes which you can correct
6:18
with just a single click so it also
6:21
suggests better words and rephrases
6:22
sentences for you based on the type of
6:24
document that you write so for example
6:26
let's say you want to send a formal
6:28
email to a company
Use Grammarly
6:30
so let's compose an email
6:31
and as you can see we do not get any
6:34
suggestions or changes from the default
6:36
Google spell checker now to check and
6:39
correct our email using grammarly first
6:41
we need to install the grammarly
6:43
extension so to install it just click
6:45
the link below this video
6:48
now click add to Chrome
6:51
and click ADD extension
6:53
and you can see we have got the
6:55
grammarly extension once you have done
6:57
that just go back to Gmail
7:00
click refresh
7:02
and if you see here we have got new
7:04
suggestions in our email which weren't
7:06
present before so to make the changes
7:08
just keep the mouse over the suggestion
7:10
then click here to update the correct
7:12
word
7:14
and in the same way you can update all
7:16
the suggestions
7:20
once you're done your email will be
7:22
ready to send so this is how you can use
7:24
grammarly to send well drafted emails
7:27
every time okay next let's go to the
7:30
fourth trick which is to create email
7:32
templates let's say you're sending the
7:34
same type of email repeatedly it can be
7:36
for your job application or your
7:38
customer feedback questions so how will
7:40
you use the same email content instead
7:42
of copy pasting it from previous emails
7:44
every single time you can do that by
7:47
creating an email template Now to create
7:49
templates first we need to enable it so
7:51
to enable the template feature just go
7:53
to settings
7:55
click see all settings
7:58
here go to Advanced
8:00
now enable the templates option
8:03
and click save changes
Create email templates
8:06
so now we have successfully enabled the
8:07
templates feature once you have enabled
8:09
it now to create an email template just
8:11
click compose
8:13
and then type the email which you want
8:15
to use as a template
8:18
now to save this as a template just
8:20
click on the three dots
8:22
go to template
8:24
then go to save draft as template
8:27
and click save as new template
8:30
now here enter a name for your template
8:32
I am going to name it as job application
8:34
and click save
8:37
so now we have successfully created our
8:38
template now to use it just click
8:40
compose
8:43
and click here
8:46
go to templates
8:48
and then select the template which you
8:50
have created now
8:52
as you can see we have got the entire
8:55
email
8:56
so this is how you can create email
8:58
templates and use them to send your
9:00
emails quickly okay next let's go to the
9:03
fifth trick which is to automatically
9:04
add a signature like this at the end of
9:07
your email this will be really helpful
9:09
if you're sending multiple emails every
9:11
day so to add a signature just go to
9:14
compose
9:16
just click here
9:19
and click Merit signatures
9:21
now it will take you to this page now
9:23
scroll down to the signature section
9:26
and click create new
9:29
now give a name to your signature and it
9:31
will help us to find it easily I am
9:33
going to enter hiring recruiter
9:36
and click create
9:38
you can see our signature has been
9:40
created now here enter the signature you
9:42
want I am going to enter mine
Automatically add signature at the end of your email
9:46
and now if you want to add an image just
9:48
click here
9:50
and go to upload
9:52
now drag the image you want and drop it
9:55
here and you can see our image has been
9:57
added now if you want to add a link to
9:59
your website on this image just select
10:01
this image
10:03
click here
10:05
and here enter the web address where you
10:07
want to redirect
10:08
I am going to enter my site
10:10
and click ok
10:13
in the same way you can add multiple
10:15
signatures as per your needs scroll down
10:18
then click save changes
10:21
and obviously added a signature now to
10:24
use the signature just click compose
10:28
then click here
10:31
and select the signature company head
10:32
which we have created now
10:35
and you can see the signature has been
10:37
added along with the image now if we
10:39
click on the image
10:41
you can see it has the link to our
10:43
website and if we click it you can see
10:46
it takes us to our website
10:48
so this is how you can create and add
10:50
signatures to your emails in the same
10:52
way you can create multiple signatures
10:54
and use them okay next let's go to the
10:58
sixth trick which is to schedule your
11:00
emails scheduling your emails helps you
11:02
send emails at the exact time you want
11:04
this also helps you send emails to
11:06
people in different time zones at the
11:09
right time so schedule your emails just
11:11
go to compose
11:14
prepare the email you want to send
11:16
now to schedule this email
11:18
just click here
11:20
and then click schedule send
11:23
now here select when you want the email
11:25
to be sent and you can also choose the
11:27
custom date and time that you want

and Click Share you'll send
11:33
you can see that the email has been
11:35

now if you want to see your scheduled
11:40
emails just click on schedule
Schedule your emails
11:43
and here you can see the scheduled email
11:45
so this is how you can schedule your
11:47
emails okay now let's go to the seven
11:50
trick which is to use Gmail offline mode
11:52
just like how it sounds with Gmail
11:54
offline mode you can access Gmail
11:56
without the internet this will be really
11:59
helpful if you want to access import an
12:01
email when you don't have internet
12:03
connection so to enable the offline mode
12:05
just click the gear icon
12:09
and click see all settings
12:12
then go to offline
12:15
and enable offline email
12:18
next here select whether you want your
12:20
data to be stored on your computer after
12:22
logging out
12:23
I'm going to select this
12:25
and click save changes
12:28
now it will ask you to reload Gmail so
12:30
let's click ok
12:32
and once it reloads you can see that the
12:34
email starts saving offline
12:36
and you can also see Gmail is ready for
Use gmail offline mode
12:38
offline
12:40
now when you're offline if you open
12:42
Gmail
12:45
you will be able to access Gmail so now
12:47
you can view all your emails without the
12:48
internet so let's open one
12:51
and you can see all the contents of the
12:53
email now you can also reply to emails
12:55
just like how we used to
12:59
and once you click Send
13:01
it'll be saved to your outbox so now if
13:04
we go to the outbox
13:05
you can see the email that we just sent
13:07
and once you're connected to the
13:09
internet you can see the email has been
13:10
sent automatically
13:12
okay next let's go to the a trick which
13:15
is to set self reminders let's say you
13:17
want to send a payment request email to
13:19
your client and you want to get reminded
13:21
if they don't respond to you within a
13:23
specific time or want a reminder to do a
13:26
follow-up for some emails you are
13:28
sending out you can do that by setting
13:30
up self reminder so for this trick we
13:32
need to install an extension called
13:33
Write inbox now write inbox is an
13:36
extension that will help you set self
13:38
reminders for emails and also love you
13:40
to track emails that you sent so to
13:43
install it just click the link below
13:44

13:46
and it will take you to this page
13:48
now let's click add to Gmail

14:03
here you can choose a plan based on your
14:05
need
14:06
I am going to select the free plan so
14:08
let's click continue
14:10
and click no thanks
14:12
and you can see that writing box is now
14:14
active on your Gmail and we can start
14:16
using it so now to set up self reminder
14:19
just click compose
14:22
and prepare the mail which you want to
14:24
send I'm going to send a payment request
14:26
email
14:27
once you have prepared the email
14:29
let's say you want to get reminded if
14:30
they don't respond within five days so
14:33
remind yourself at a specific time just
14:35
click reminder
14:37
and select the time that you want to be
14:38
reminded to specific time just click
14:41
here
14:42
now here select the date and time
14:48
then the time zone
14:52
and click add reminder
14:55
you can see that we have successfully
14:56
set the reminder
14:57
next year click drop down menu
15:00
and make sure this option is enabled so
15:03
you will get reminded if they haven't
15:04
responded within the time you have set
15:07
once you're done click Send
15:11
and after five days if they haven't
15:13
responded you will receive this email at
15:15
the time you have set like this
15:17
so this is how you can set a reminder
15:19
for yourself about an email okay now you
15:21
know inbox you can also track the email
15:23
which you have said so next let's see
15:25
how you can track how many people have
15:27
opened the email first let's compose the
15:29
email which we want to send
15:34
once you have done that now to enable
15:36
Email tracking just click here
15:40
and select what you want to track I want
15:42
to track and see if the receiver has
15:43
opened the mail so let's select track
15:45
opens
15:47
and then click Send
15:49
now if the receiver opens the email you
15:52
will get a notification like this
15:54
and also to check how many times your
15:56
email has been opened just go to send
15:58
emails
16:00
and if you hover over this icon
16:03
you can see how many times your email
16:05
has been opened in the same way you can
16:08
also track whether the receiver clicked
16:09
anything in your emails okay next let's
16:12
see the ninth trick which is reverse
16:14
conversation now by default if you see
Track how many people have opened the email
16:16
any mail conversations you can see the
16:18
new follow-up emails as shown below so
16:20
to read any new emails or to reply you
16:23
have to scroll down every time which is
16:25
not very intuitive and makes things
16:27
harder now reverse conversation does
16:29
exactly what it says your new follow-up
16:31
emails and deploy options will be on the
16:33
top like this making it easier for you
16:36
to see new emails so to get this feature
16:38
just open a new tab
16:41
then search for reverse conversation
16:42
Gmail
16:43
open the first link to Chrome web store
16:47
and it will take you to this page now
16:49
click add to Chrome
16:52
and click ADD extension
16:55
so now we have added the extension now
16:57
if we go back to inbox
16:59
and click refresh
17:01
you can see our conversations are now
17:03
upside down and we have got new emails
17:05
on top
17:06
so now you can also see if we have got a
Reverse conversation
17:09
reply button on top
17:10
so this is how you can use reverse
17:12
conversations on your Gmail okay the
17:14
next trick is to snooze your emails
17:16
snooze in your emails lets you hide less
17:18
important emails and reminds you at the
17:20
time you set so to snooze an email all
17:22
you have to do is click on the clock
17:24
icon on the email which you want to
17:25
snooze
17:26
and then select the time when you want
17:28
to see the email
17:29
I am going to select this time
17:32
so now we're just fully snooze the email
17:34
now if we go to the snooze folder
17:38
you can see the email which we have
17:40
snoozed right now
17:41
and if we go to our inbox at the time
17:43
that we have set
17:45
you can see that we have got the email
17:46
which we have snoozed so this is how you
17:49
can snooze your emails okay next as you
17:52
may have felt one of the drawbacks of
17:54
Gmail is that the emails you have sent
17:56
can be forwarded without your knowledge
17:58
and also there is no way to make sure
18:00
only the person you sent has access to
18:02
the mail well not anymore next let's go
18:06
to the 11 trick which is to send emails
18:08
in confidential mode with confidential
18:10
mode you can send emails with a time
18:12
limit which cannot be forwarded copied
18:14
or downloaded and once the time ends the
18:16
receiver cannot view the content of the
18:18
email so to send an email in
18:19
confidential mode just compose an email
18:21
like you always do
18:25
and once you're done click the lock icon
18:28
here
18:30
now here set an expiration date for your
18:33
email
18:34
I'm going to set one month
18:36
next year you can enable the password
18:38
notification if you wanted to be extra
18:40
secure so the recipient needs to verify
18:43
their phone number to view the email
18:44
this way you can make sure only the
18:46
person you send has access to the email
18:48
and once you're done click save
18:52
and Clicks in
18:54
now here you need to enter the mobile
18:55
number of the recipient so that they can
18:57
verify the number to open the email so
18:59
first select the country of the
Send emails in confidential mode
19:01
recipient
19:05
enter the number
19:07
then click Send
19:09
and you can see we have successfully
19:11
sent our email now if you go to the
19:13
recipient's email you can see they have
19:15
received the email which we just sent
19:16
let's open it
19:19
and as you can see the content of the
19:21
email is not visible
19:23
and it asks them to verify the identity
19:25
using the number that we have set so to
19:27
verify all you need to do is just click
19:29
Send passcode
19:32
and an OTP will be sent to their number
19:33
now if they enter the OTP and click
19:36
submit
19:37
you can see the email is now visible
19:40
now if they're trying to view this email
19:41
after the expiration date which we have
19:43
said
19:44
you can see the content of the email is
19:46
no longer visible
19:48
so this is how you can send confidential
19:49
emails okay next let's go to the final
19:52
trick which is to use keyboard shortcuts
19:54
using keyboard shortcuts you can quickly
19:56
get things done and save your valuable
19:58
time so to enable the keyboard shortcuts
20:01
just click here
20:04
click see all settings
20:06
now scroll down
20:09
turn on keyboard shortcuts
20:11
then again scroll down
20:13
and click save changes
20:17
now again click here
20:20
and click see all settings
20:22
then go to Advanced
20:24
now here enable the custom keyboard
20:26
shortcuts
20:27
then click save changes
20:30
and now you're successfully enable the
20:32
keyboard shortcuts now to see all the
20:33
shortcuts just click shift in the
20:35
question mark and you can see all the
20:37
available keyboard shortcuts so take a
20:39
look at these shortcuts and see which
20:41
one will be useful for you and you can
20:43
open this window to see the shortcuts
20:45
whenever you want now to close this just
Use Keyboard shortcuts
20:47
press the Escape key
20:49
now let's try some of these shortcuts so
20:51
if you want to compose an email just
20:53
press C on your keyboard and as you can
20:55
see we have got the compose window next
20:57
let's say you want to open the star
20:59
emails page all you have to do is press
21:01
Amazon hold on G and then press s
21:05
if you want to go back to the inbox just
21:07
press Amazon hold G then press I and you
21:11
will get the inbox okay now let's say
21:13
you have opened an email
21:15
and you want to move this email to a
21:16
different list all you have to do is
21:18
press V on your keyboard now search for
21:21
the list that you want to move then
21:23

Google has just released a brand new
0:01
platform, Workspace Studio, designed to
0:03
help you automate your entire workspace.
0:06
And at first, I thought it was just
0:07
going to be another experimental
0:09
product. Until I tried it out, and it
0:11
absolutely blew me away. It lets you
0:13
automate anything from simple things
0:15
like drafting email replies based on
0:18
your documents in Google Docs or
0:20
emailing meeting links before a call
0:22
starts to more advanced automations like
0:25
tracking when a client is requesting an
0:27
invoice via email and then filling it
0:29
out automatically and downloading it to
0:31
your computer and even things like
0:33
getting a recap of your industry news
0:36
sent to your email that you can then
0:37
listen to while you're sipping your
0:39
coffee. So today I'm going to show you
0:41
six incredible workflows, or should I
0:44
say flows, you can build inside
0:46
Workspace Studio with just one Google
0:48
Workspace subscription. But before we
0:51
start, I'd like to reach 100,000
0:52
subscribers by the end of next year. So
0:55
if you enjoy videos like these, make
0:56
sure to hit that subscribe button and
0:58
let's get right into the video. If you
Automation 1: The AI Email Labeler (Organize Inbox Automatically)
1:00
get hundreds of emails a day like me, it
1:02
is so hard to stay on top of everything
1:04
and label each one manually, which is
1:06
where our first automation comes in. It
1:08
is going to scan every single email you
1:10
receive in Gmail and then use Gemini to
1:13
label it automatically using AI. So,
1:16
it's going to decide whether it's a
1:18
consulting request, a paid
1:19
collaboration. It's going to mark the
1:22
clients that are ready to close, if the
1:24
budget is too low, and it's even going
1:26
to show me the newsletters I should
1:28
unsubscribe from. So, to build something
1:30
like this, you're going to first head
1:31
over to studio.workspace.google.com,
1:33
google.com and you're going to hit plus
1:36
on the left to start a new flow. The
1:38
first thing you're going to have to do
1:39
here is to add a starter. Now, a starter
1:41
is something that triggers this
1:43
automation. In our case, it's going to
1:45
be when we receive an email. We would
1:47
like Gemini to automatically label it.
1:50
So, I'm going to select the first step,
1:51
which is going to be when I get an
1:53
email. Now, here you can decide whether
1:56
it's going to be all emails or specific
1:58
emails. So, for example, you could also
2:01
provide keywords like invoices or
2:04
contracts or who it is from. Maybe it is
2:06
from your boss or it is from your team.
2:09
But I'm just going to choose all emails
2:11
because I'd like Gemini to do the work
2:13
for me. Now, the next step is choosing
2:15
an action what you would like Gemini to
2:17
do upon this tree of firing. So, in our
2:20
case, it's going to be labeling the
2:22
emails. So, I'm going to click choose a
2:24
step. And if you scroll down in Gmail
2:26
automations, you'll see something called
2:28
add labels. And as you can see here,
2:31
it's got the Gemini logo on top right
2:33
here. So I'm going to go ahead and
2:34
choose it. Now here you can either add
2:36
your labels yourself. So say this
2:38
automation triggers every time you
2:40
receive an email from your boss. You can
2:42
go ahead and add a new label called
2:44
emails from bots. But in my case, I'd
2:46
like to have AI do the job for me. So at
2:48
the top, you're going to see something
2:50
called AI powered labels. So go ahead
2:52
and turn this button on. And you'll see
2:55
that there are already some pre-made
2:57
ones like meeting updates, receipts and
2:59
invoices, recruiting. You can click the
3:02
check mark next to them to turn it on.
3:04
But in my case is going to be custom
3:06
ones. So I'm going to hit this button at
3:08
the top that says new AI powered label.
3:10
Now here you're just going to add your
3:12
label name, which the first one for me
3:14
is going to be paid collaborations,
3:15
which are going to be companies reaching
3:17
out to me to sponsor my YouTube videos.
3:20
And the next thing you're going to do is
3:21
to provide a description for Gemini.
3:23
what this label is. And make sure to
3:26
include as many keywords here as
3:28
possible. So for this one, I'm going to
3:29
say emails from brands, companies, or
3:32
individuals requesting paid
3:34
partnerships, sponsorships, or
3:36
collaborations on my YouTube channel,
3:38
including sponsored videos,
3:39
integrations, product mentions,
3:41
affiliate promotions, or other paid
3:44
content opportunities. As you can see, I
3:46
used several words to describe the same
3:48
thing so Gemini can understand it. And
3:50
once you're done, just go ahead and
3:52
click create. And as you can see, your
3:54
label gets added to the list right here.
3:56
And you'll see this check box next to
3:58
it. You can enable or disable this one.
4:00
Let's go ahead and add one last one
4:02
together. I'm going to press new AI
4:04
powered label. And I'm going to name
4:06
this one low budget for companies that
4:08
try to negotiate or lower the price. So
4:10
I view them as less of a priority. So,
4:13
in the description for Gemini, I'm going
4:14
to say emails from brands or individuals
4:17
expressing a limited budget, requesting
4:19
discounted rates, or attempting to
4:21
negotiate pricing for paid partnerships,
4:23
sponsorships, or YouTube collaborations.
4:25
I'm going to go ahead and click create.
4:27
And I'm going to do the same for the
4:29
rest of my labels. Now, once all of your
4:31
labels are added, let's go ahead and
4:33
actually test to see if it works. And to
4:35
do this, you could always hit on this
4:37
test run button on the left. So, let's
4:39
go ahead and click it. And the first
4:41
thing you're going to see here is to
4:42
choose an email to actually test it out
4:45
with. Those are real emails from your
4:47
mailbox. As you can see, it already
4:49
chose one that I've just received. Let's
4:51
go ahead and close this one. And I'm
4:53
going to pick one of the list, which is
4:55
going to be this one about a paid
4:57
collaboration. I'm not going to show
4:59
this to you, but this is basically a
5:00
follow-up email with an extremely low
5:03
budget. And let's go ahead and hit
5:05
start. And as you can see in step two,
5:08
it's going to go ahead and add the
5:10
labels. And once it's done, as you can
5:13
see, it decided that this email was just
5:15
a follower email and that it is low
5:17
budget. And it went ahead and labeled it
5:19
that. And if I go to my inbox, you'll
5:21
see that this email has now been labeled
5:23
low budget, which is exactly what I
5:26
wanted. Now, you can go ahead and test
5:27
it out with different types of emails to
5:29
see if it labels them correctly. And if
5:31
it doesn't, just adjust the prompt. And
5:34
once you're happy with how all of the
5:35
labels work, you can go ahead and turn
5:37
on this automation. So, it's now going
5:40
to work in the background, labeling all
5:42
of the emails automatically for you.
Automation 2: The "Podcast" News Reporter (Automated Research)
5:43
Staying on top of your industry news is
5:45
extremely important, but who has time to
5:47
read news articles? I don't even have
5:49
time to watch a single episode on
5:51
YouTube a week, which is why I created
5:53
this next automation. It runs on
5:55
schedule every single week on Mondays.
5:58
Uses Gemini to scan for the latest
6:00
Google AI news from the last seven days.
6:02
It then summarizes them and creates an
6:04
audio script. And then it goes ahead and
6:07
creates a document in my drive and
6:09
emails it to me. But the coolest thing
6:12
about it is that I can actually open
6:14
this document Gemini sends me and just
6:16
click on this listen to button and play
6:19
this news while I'm drinking my coffee.
6:22
Welcome to your quick roundup of the
6:23
latest announcements and breakthroughs
6:25
from Google AI this week.
6:26
So to build it, you're just going to
6:28
head back to your studio and hit plus to
6:30
create a new flow. Now, since I'd like
6:32
to run this automation every single
6:34
week, our starter this time is going to
6:36
be on a schedule. So, I'm going to go
6:37
ahead and pick this. Now, you can have
6:39
Workspace Studio run your automations at
6:41
any intervals. It could be every 15
6:44
minutes, daily, weekly, hourly, monthly,
6:48
and even annually. Now, the first thing
6:50
you're going to do here is to pick the
6:52
start date and time of your automation.
6:55
So, for me, it's going to be Monday,
6:57
which was yesterday. and I'm going to
6:59
pick a time which is going to be 6:00
7:01
p.m. Now, since I'd like those AI news
7:04
to arrive to me every single Monday at
7:06
the same time. In repeats, I'm going to
7:08
click on this drop-own list and choose
7:10
weekly. And in ends, I'm just going to
7:13
leave it as one. Yeah. Now, in actions,
7:15
I'm going to go ahead and choose a step.
7:17
And this time, I'm going to pick Ask
7:19
Gemini because I'd like it to search the
7:21
web for the latest AI news. Now, the
7:23
first thing you're going to do here is
7:25
enter your prompt. This is going to be
7:27
mine. I'm going to say search for news
7:28
on Google AI from the last seven days
7:31
including Gemini, Google Workspace,
7:32
Notebook Alm, Google AI Studio,
7:34
Vert.exai, Firebase, or any other
7:37
product, and create an easy to read
7:39
simplified audio script. The host will
7:41
describe in detail what each piece of
7:43
news is about in simple words. Include
7:46
all text in one block without speakers.
7:48
Now, below the prompt, you'll see
7:49
something called sources Gemini can use.
7:51
Now depending on your automation, you
7:54
can either choose for Gemini to only
7:56
scan the web or also go through your
7:58
workspace and connected apps. So see to
8:00
pull information from your Gmail or from
8:03
your docs. Now in my case, I'm just
8:05
going to say web only. And now I'm going
8:08
to go ahead and add the next step. Now
8:10
here I'm just going to scroll down and
8:12
find the docs tab. And under it, you'll
8:14
see this create a document step. So I'm
8:16
just going to go ahead and select it.
8:18
And the first thing you'll need to do
8:19
here is name your document. I'm going
8:22
say your AI news for the week and an
8:24
emoji. And now in content to add, I'd
8:27
like it to display all of the news that
8:29
Gemini found. Now to do this, you can
8:32
see something called variables on the
8:34
right. Or you could also type at to pull
8:36
them up and use any content from the
8:39
previous steps. So in our case, I'm
8:42
going to type at and choose content
8:44
created by Gemini. And this is basically
8:46
going to be all of the news Gemini found
8:48
in step two. Now, what I also love about
8:51
it is that you can add all of your AI
8:53
news into a particular folder in Drive.
8:56
So, where it says location for a new
8:58
doc, I actually just went ahead and
9:00
created a separate folder for this
9:02
reason. So, I'm going to go ahead and
9:03
select it. And as you can see, it says
9:05
AI news weekly recap. I'm going to go
9:07
ahead and select this particular drive
9:08
folder. Now, once my news document is
9:10
ready, I'd like Gemini to email it to
9:12
me. So I can just click on the link and
9:14
open it. So for this I'm going to add a
9:17
new step. And under Gmail I'm going to
9:19
scroll down and find notify me by email
9:22
step. Now when you click it the first
9:24
thing you need to do here is to add your
9:26
subject. So I'm just going to say your
9:28
weekly AI news is ready and a rocket
9:31
icon. And now in the email message I'm
9:33
going to provide some instructions. I'm
9:35
going to say open the document. Select
9:37
insert at the top and add an audio
9:39
button. Now, that's going to add this
9:41
listen to tab where you could just click
9:43
on it and listen to the news. And now to
9:45
include the link, I'm going to type add
9:47
and add another variable again. And this
9:50
time in step three, I'm going to find a
9:52
link to the doc and just go ahead and
9:55
click this. I'm also going to say enjoy
9:57
listening to your weekly recap. Now,
10:00
that's it. Automation is now set up.
10:02
Let's go ahead and test run it. So, I'm
10:04
going to go ahead and click test run.
10:06
Now, with automations that run on
10:07
schedule, you can just click start, and
10:09
the automation will start on your click
10:11
to test it out. So, I'm going to go
10:12
ahead and click this. And as you can
10:14
see, it starts working. And now, as you
10:16
can see, it started run on schedule,
10:18
which is right now, December 23rd. And
10:20
then in step two, it went ahead and
10:22
asked Gemini and generated this audio
10:26
script. And now, in step three, it went
10:28
ahead and created the dog and it even
10:30
referenced it here for me. And in step
10:32
four, it sent me the email, which I can
10:34
also open. So now let's go ahead and
10:37
just open the file email to see what it
10:39
looks like. And here it is. Your weekly
10:41
news are ready. I can go ahead and open
10:43
this document. Now I just need to hit
10:46
insert audio buttons and find the listen
10:49
to tab and just paste it in. I can go
10:52
ahead and customize this button. So if I
10:54
hit play,
10:55
welcome to your quick.
10:56
I can click on the three dots right
10:58
here. I can change the voice. There are
10:59
a couple to choose from. I'm super happy
11:02
with the final results. So, I'm going to
11:03
return to Workspace Studio and turn this
11:05
automation on so it runs in the
11:08
background. Every Monday, I just receive
11:10
this email, open up the link, add a
11:11
listen to tab, and just listen to this
11:14
3inut episode instead of having to read
11:16
or watch anything. No matter what I do,
Automation 3: The Meeting Inviter (Never Lose a Link Again)
11:18
my clients still lose links to our
11:20
upcoming AR sessions, which is why I
11:22
created this automation. It runs 10
11:24
minutes before every single meeting and
11:26
drafts an email with a meeting link. And
11:29
then I just need to go to my inbox, go
11:32
to the drafts folder and just email it
11:35
to my client without having to copy and
11:37
paste the meeting link manually or
11:38
entering the email which is amazing. So
11:41
let's go ahead and build it. I'm going
11:43
to hit plus again and add a new flow.
11:46
For a starter, this time I'm going to
11:48
choose based on a meeting. Now in this
11:50
step you can either choose a particular
11:52
meeting that is coming up but in my case
11:54
I'm going to choose every single
11:56
meeting. And now the time offset I'm
11:59
going to choose 10 minutes. And in
12:01
starts before the meeting. You can also
12:03
have it run after the meeting. Now in my
12:06
actions I'm going to choose a step.
12:08
Scroll down and under Gmail I'm going to
12:10
find the draft and email step. Now in
12:13
the two field I'm going to type at and
12:15
choose a variable. And this time it's
12:17
going to be all guest email addresses.
12:19
In the subject I'm just going to enter
12:21
something like a meeting is about to
12:23
start and a rocket icon. And in the
12:26
message, I'm just going to type out this
12:28
template. I'm going to say, "Hello, our
12:29
call is about to start. Please use this
12:31
link to join in. Looking forward to
12:33
seeing you." Now, to add the actual
12:35
link, be very careful. Going to type at
12:38
and choose a variable, but don't choose
12:40
the meeting link. You have to choose the
12:42
meeting video call link. The meeting
12:44
link just emails them a calendar link,
12:47
which is kind of strange. So, just go
12:49
ahead and choose the video call link.
12:51
Now, let's go ahead and test run this
12:53
automation. Now, based on a meeting,
12:55
you're going to go ahead and select your
12:57
upcoming meeting or past meeting to test
12:59
it out. Now, remember, this is only
13:01
going to draft an email. It's not
13:03
actually going to send it. So, I'm going
13:04
to choose one of my glides. I hit start.
13:07
And as you can see, it starts working.
13:09
Now, in my Gmail, in my drafts folder,
13:11
this email was just created. It says,
13:13
"Our meeting is about to start." And it
13:15
actually included the dynamic meeting
13:17
like, which is amazing. Now, whenever I
Automation 4: The AI Invoice Maker (Part 1: Setup)
13:19
work with a company, I need to create an
13:21
invoice for them. and it takes me
13:22
forever, which is why I created this
13:24
next automation. Now, it scans my whole
13:26
inbox to decide whether this email
13:28
contains details for an invoice. And if
13:31
it does, it extracts all of those values
13:33
and then creates a task for me in Google
13:36
Task with all of the values listed like
13:38
services, pricing, company name. But
13:40
that's not even the coolest part about
13:42
it. To create the actual invoice, all I
13:45
need to do is just open up this gem and
13:47
paste in the invoice details from the
13:49
task Gemini generated. And that's going
13:51
to give me this fully editable template
13:53
with my client details that I can
13:55
download at any time. So if I press
13:57
download that's actually going to save
13:59
the invoice to my computer because I'm
14:02
using the HTML to PDF library. So let me
14:05
show you how you can build something
14:06
like this. The number one reason
How to Add AI Chatbots to Your Website (Elfsight)
14:08
companies lose sales on their website is
14:10
because they fail to answer questions
14:12
fast enough or they rely on chatbots
14:14
that give vague and unhelpful answers.
14:16
So let me show you how AI can fix this
14:18
for you right now. Let's say I'm running
14:20
this e-commerce store. All I have to do
14:22
is open Elsit's AI chatbot, paste in my
14:25
website link, hit analyze, and in about
14:29
10 to 15 seconds, the boss is fully
14:31
trained and ready to go. Now that it's
14:33
stringed, let's go ahead and ask it
14:34
something. I'm going to say, do you
14:36
offer free shipping?
14:38
And here's the instant answer it pulled
14:40
from my website. Let's go ahead and try
14:42
one more. I'm going to say, how can I
14:45
return a product?
14:47
And there it is. This is definitely the
14:49
fastest and easiest setup I've seen so
14:51
far. And the coolest part, you can
14:53
customize anything by just dragging and
14:55
dropping the colors, chat style, tone of
14:58
voice, upload your FAQs, or even your
15:01
whole product catalog. So, if you want
15:04
to support agent that works 24/7, never
15:06
sleeps, and actually knows your
15:08
business, you should try out the Elsites
15:10
AI chatbot with my link in the
15:12
description, completely for free. or you
15:14
can also get 30% off of your yearly plan
15:16
with my promo code your AI workflow. And
15:19
let's get back to the video. Now, the
Automation 4: The AI Invoice Maker (Part 2: Generation)
15:21
first thing you're going to do is
15:22
generate the invoice template. So, in
15:24
any general chat, you're going to hit
15:25
tools and choose canvas. And now, you're
15:27
just going to type out your prompt. I'm
15:29
going to say create an app with a
15:31
fillable invoice HTML template. Add a
15:34
button to download the invoice using the
15:36
HTML to PDF library. Now, whenever you
15:38
want Gemini to generate downloadable
15:40
documents, just tell it to use this HTML
15:43
to PDF library. And I'm also going to
15:45
include my company details. Now, I'm
15:48
going to send this in. And once it's
15:50
done in preview, you're going to see
15:51
your invoice template. Mine looks
15:53
perfect. I can go ahead and edit it. So,
15:56
add a company name, client address, or
15:58
edit any other details. And now, at the
16:01
top, you should be able to click on the
16:03
download PDF button. So, I'm going to go
16:05
ahead and hit this. And as you can see,
16:06
it's downloading. invoice. Now, if I go
16:09
ahead and open up this invoice, it looks
16:12
great as well. All of the details are
16:14
visible. It looks professional. So, now
16:16
that we have our template, let's go
16:18
ahead and feed it to our gem so it has
16:20
it automatically. So, in Gemini, I'm
16:23
going to go ahead and hit gems. And
16:25
here, I'll select to create a new gem.
16:27
Now, the first thing I'm going to do
16:28
here is just to dump our HTML template
16:30
in the instructions. And then, I'm going
16:33
to give it a name. I'm going to name it
16:34
invoice makeup. And now in the
16:37
instructions above our HTML, I'm going
16:40
to say when I give your company or
16:42
service details, create an invoice using
16:44
this template. And that's literally it.
16:47
Next time you open a chat with this gem,
16:49
you can just send it your company
16:50
details and it's going to generate the
16:52
invoice for you and then you can
16:54
download it. With the hard stuff out of
16:56
the way, let's go ahead and create the
16:57
actual automation. So my starter is
17:00
going to be when I get an email with all
17:02
emails selected. And then in actions,
17:04
I'm going to first add a decision step.
17:07
This is going to be my prompt if the
17:09
email body contains client's details for
17:11
the invoice. And I'm just going to list
17:13
everything the client normally sends me
17:16
like company address, company or
17:17
individual name, tax ID, etc. Now, if
17:20
the decision is true, I'm going to ask
17:21
Geminate to search for recent
17:23
conversations with this prospect to pull
17:25
data like services and pricing they
17:27
getting for the invoice. So, I'm going
17:28
to say search for recent conversations
17:30
with and I'm going to map it to the
17:32
senders email address in my Gmail and
17:35
I'll provide my account just in case and
17:37
extract the latest services the client
17:39
is buying and the price. Now, to make
17:41
this automation as clean as possible,
17:43
I'm going to add an extraction step. And
17:46
in content to analyze, I'm going to map
17:48
it to the email body for the company
17:50
details and also to the content created
17:52
by Gemini for the services and pricing.
17:54
And in what to extract, I'm going to
17:56
leave the predefined value empty. And
17:58
I'm just going to add custom values
18:01
here. I'm just going to say custom
18:02
content name, services, and describer
18:04
for Gemini, Ag dedicated video, price,
18:07
eg $500, company name, eg company LLC,
18:11
etc. So once all of my fields are
18:14
mapped, I'm going to create a task in
18:16
Google tasks. Now, in task title, I'm
18:18
just going to say create invoice for and
18:21
I'm going to map it to the senders email
18:22
address so I know which company we're
18:25
talking about. And in task details, I'm
18:27
going to say paste this into the gem
18:29
with canvas enabled so we can generate
18:31
the actual invoice. And in the task
18:33
body, I'm going to say services and map
18:35
it to step five services price, map it
18:37
to step five, price, etc. All of the
18:39
details from the extraction step, so
18:42
they're dynamic. And for the date of the
18:44
task, I'm going to select day the run
18:46
starts. Let's go ahead and test run it.
18:49
Now, to properly test it out, I just
18:50
went ahead and created this fake thread
18:52
with a client, and I made it look as
18:54
real as possible. So, say they're now
18:57
requesting the invoice, and they sent me
18:59
their company details. But in the ebook,
19:01
it doesn't explicitly say that they're
19:03
looking for the invoice. There are just
19:04
some company details. Let's see if Gamai
19:07
can crack this. I'm going to go ahead
19:08
and hit start. And as you can see in the
19:10
decision step, it responded as true
19:12
because the email thread contains all
19:14
mandatory client details required for
19:16
the invoice. And then the decision was
19:18
true. So it went ahead and extracted the
19:21
details and created the task. As you can
19:23
see right here, included the service,
19:25
the price, the company name, and all the
19:27
rest of the details. Let's go ahead and
19:29
open up this task. So this is going to
19:31
be the final output. And there it is.
19:33
Now I can just copy this details and go
19:36
to my gem. I'm going to go ahead and
19:38
select cannibas and just paste in these
19:41
details and send. And here's our final
19:44
invoice in bill 2. It added all of the
19:47
company details. And in services, it
19:49
added the description and the price and
19:52
calculated total. Now, I can also edit
19:55
this invoice to add taxes. So, let's say
19:57
I'm going to add 10% tax. And as you can
19:59
see, it calculated everything. And once
20:02
that's done, I can just go ahead and
20:04
download this PDF. And as you can see,
20:06
it gets saved on my computer. So, I'm
20:08
going to hit save and go ahead and open
20:11
it. And it looks absolutely amazing. I
20:13
can now just email it to my client. And
20:15
that's done. Going through job
Automation 5: The Job Applicant Screener (Auto-Qualification)
20:17
applications one by one is exhausting.
20:20
So, why not have AI do at least half of
20:22
the work for you? Which is why I created
20:24
this next automation. Every time I
20:26
receive a new job application, it uses
20:28
AI to decide whether this candidate fits
20:30
my requirements. And if they do, it adds
20:33
them to this qualify candidate
20:35
spreadsheet and then drafts an email for
20:38
them inviting them to an interview with
20:40
me with my link. So to build something
20:42
like this, you're going to go ahead and
20:44
hit plus to create a new flow. For a
20:46
starter, this time I'm going to choose
20:48
when a form comes in. And here you're
20:50
just going to have to select your Google
20:52
form. Now I have this one full stack web
20:54
developer job application form. So I'm
20:57
going to go ahead and select it. Hit
20:58
insert. And that's it. For a next step,
21:01
I'm going to select decide with Gemini.
21:05
And this is going to be my prompt for
21:07
it. I'm going to say analyze this
21:10
content of the job application form to
21:12
decide whether the candidate fits my
21:14
requirements. And here you're just going
21:16
to tell what you're looking for. So I'm
21:18
going to say I'm looking for a full
21:20
stack developer with experience in at
21:22
least one React or Vue.js. They have to
21:24
be proficient in JavaScript, familiar
21:27
with fire store and NodeJS. And then you
21:29
can also specify how many years of
21:31
experience you would like them to have.
21:32
So I'm going to say have at least three
21:34
years of experience. And I also have a
21:36
field where they input their most
21:38
impactful project. And I'd like AI to
21:40
decide whether it was actually
21:41
impactful. So I'm going to say the most
21:43
impactful project they describe has to
21:45
be impressive and professional. And now
21:48
in content to analyze, I'm going to type
21:50
at and I'm going to choose the full
21:53
response. So in step one, I'm going to
21:55
find form response and map it right
21:57
here. Now, in step three, if the
21:59
decision is true, I'm going to go ahead
22:01
and choose a step and scroll down to
22:03
find the sheets menu. And here, I'm
22:05
going to select add a row. Now, here at
22:08
the top, I'm just going to have to
22:09
select which spreadsheet to add this row
22:12
to. So, I'm going to select my qualified
22:14
candidate spreadsheet in Drive and hit
22:16
insert. Now, you can select multiple
22:18
sheets here. Mine just has one sheet.
22:21
And then below it, you'll see an add a
22:23
row menu. Now you can either select to
22:25
add the data after the last data row or
22:28
after the first data row. It's up to
22:30
you. I'm going to select after last data
22:32
row. And then in add data by column,
22:34
you're going to have to match your form
22:36
fields with your spreadsheet columns. So
22:38
for example, in the full name column,
22:40
I'm going to type at and I'm going to
22:43
link it to the full name in the form
22:45
step. Going to do the same for the email
22:48
address. Going to type at choose email
22:51
address. Now, it's only showing up the
22:53
three fields. So, I'm going to go ahead
22:54
and click show more. So, you're going to
22:56
go through all of those fields and match
22:58
them perfectly. And once that's done,
23:00
I'm going to go ahead and add another
23:02
substep. And this time, I'm going to
23:05
find the draft and email in the Gmail
23:07
menu. Now, in the two step, I'm going to
23:09
map it to the candidates's email address
23:11
we got from the spreadsheet. And in
23:13
subject, I'll say something like
23:15
interview invitation for a web developer
23:17
position at your AI workflow. Now, in
23:19
the email content, I'm going to say
23:21
hello and then add and map it to the
23:24
candidates's full name. So, we
23:25
personalize this message. And I'm going
23:27
to say, "Thank you for submitting your
23:29
resume. You seem like an interesting
23:31
prospect. Please feel free to schedule
23:33
an interview through this link." And
23:35
I'll put in the link where they can
23:36
actually schedule the interview. Now,
23:38
remember, this is just going to draft
23:40
the email. It's not actually going to
23:42
send it. So, you have time to actually
23:44
check if this candidate fits your
23:45
requirements first. Now, to test it out,
23:48
you're going to go to your form and
23:50
you're going to send in a fake job
23:52
application. And then once it's done,
23:54
you're going to hit test run. And as you
23:57
can see, it has already selected the
23:58
most recent response we got from a fake
24:01
candidate. I'm going to go ahead and hit
24:03
start. So, as you can see here, Gemini
24:05
has just gone through our job
24:06
application right here and decided that
24:08
they do fit our requirement because the
24:10
candidate has seven plus years of
24:12
experience. they're proficient in
24:14
JavaScript, TypeScript, and have
24:16
experience with React and so on. And
24:18
then this decision was true. So it went
24:21
ahead and added this row to our
24:23
qualified candidate spreadsheet. So for
24:25
go ahead and open it, you'll see Daniel
24:27
Carter added right here with all of the
24:29
details I mapped out. And then in the
24:32
last step, it drafted the actual email.
24:34
So I can go ahead and open it. And as
24:36
you can see here, it went ahead and
24:38
drafted the email just like I asked it
24:39
to. Now, I can go ahead and check Daniel
24:42
Carter out. And once I'm sure they
24:44
actually fit my position, I can go ahead
24:46
and just send this email. And that's all
24:48
I have to do for all of the job
24:50
applicants instead of having to look
24:52
through them manually. Answering your
Automation 6: The Knowledge Base Email Assistant
24:54
prospect's emails on time must be one of
24:56
the most effective sales strategies of
24:58
all time. But it is so timeconuming to
25:01
answer the same questions over and over
25:03
again. Now, I would normally use a gem
25:05
for this. I just asked it to draft the
25:07
email and it pulls the information from
25:09
my knowledge base and then all I have to
25:11
do is just hit insert and send it. But
25:14
with Wixpace Studio, it's even easier
25:16
than that. With this automation, Gemini
25:18
goes through all the emails I received
25:19
from prospects and then drafts a
25:21
response based on my Google doc and then
25:24
all I have to do is just go to drafts,
25:26
check if the response was good, and just
25:28
send it in. So to build an automation
25:30
like this, just go ahead and hit plus in
25:32
Whisper Studio. Again in starter I'm
25:34
going to choose when I get an email and
25:36
I'm going to map it to all emails again
25:38
because I don't want to input the
25:40
keywords manually. Now for the actions
25:43
I'm going to go ahead and add a step and
25:45
choose decide again. Now this is going
25:48
to be my prompt. I'm gonna say analyze
25:50
at and I'm going to select the email
25:53
subject and at again and this time
25:56
choose the email body because I'd like
25:58
it to look through both of those to
26:01
define if the sender is inquiring about
26:03
my AI coaching or consulting sessions or
26:05
automation app building services or and
26:08
is asking questions about AI automations
26:11
and building. The emails might include
26:13
keywords like Google AI studio,
26:15
Firebase, Fire Store, database
26:17
authentication, Stripe payments, etc.
26:20
Now, if the email was in fact from a
26:22
prospect in decision is true, I'm going
26:23
to go ahead and choose a substep. And
26:25
now, to make this workflow run more
26:27
smoothly, I'd like to first extract a
26:29
list of questions from that email so
26:31
Gemini can answer them better and
26:33
doesn't get anything confused. So, I'm
26:35
going to choose a step and click
26:37
extract. And now in content to analyze,
26:40
I'm going to type at and choose the
26:41
email body. And in predefined values,
26:45
I'm going to go ahead and scroll down
26:47
and find questions to answer. Select
26:49
that. And that's all I have to do here.
26:52
Now, in the next substep, I'm going to
26:54
ask Gemini to actually draft the
26:56
response. In the prompt, I'm going to
26:58
say draft a response email customized
27:00
with the sender's name. And I'm going to
27:02
map it to the sender's display name from
27:04
step one. And answer their questions.
27:07
And here you're just going to map it to
27:08
the list of questions from the
27:10
extraction step. Now here's the
27:12
important part. You can base Gemini's
27:14
answer on any knowledge base just by
27:16
sharing your Google doc. So I have this
27:18
document right here detailing all the
27:20
services I offer and what I can help
27:23
with in my AI sessions. Now all I have
27:25
to do here is just hit share and make
27:28
sure anyone with the link has viewer
27:30
rights and just copy it and paste it
27:32
into my prompt. let the customer know
27:34
that they can book a one or two hour
27:35
session with me by using this link. And
27:37
I'm going to go ahead and just paste in
27:39
my calendar link where they can book it.
27:41
Now that our email is drafted, let's go
27:43
ahead and add another step. And this
27:45
time it's going to be draft a reply. Now
27:48
this is very similar to drafting email,
27:49
but this time Gemini is actually going
27:51
to have the context of your previous
27:53
conversation. So email to reply to. I'm
27:56
going to go ahead and choose a variable.
27:57
And in this variable, I'm just going to
27:59
choose a step one. When I get an email,
28:01
I'd like it to respond to this email and
28:03
choose the email ID. And now in the
28:06
message, I'm going to go ahead and map
28:08
it to the response in step five. And
28:11
that's it. Let's go ahead and test run
28:14
this automation. Now, before we test it
28:16
out, I'm just going to go ahead and send
28:18
myself an email the prospect has
28:20
previously sent me. And now, I'm going
28:22
to go ahead and hit test run. And as you
28:24
can see, it just went ahead and found
28:25
this email. You can also use your real
28:27
email history. I'm going to go ahead and
28:29
hit start. And as you can see, just went
28:32
through the email I've just received and
28:34
decided that it was in fact from a
28:36
prospect and it also clarified the
28:37
reason. It says, "The center is
28:39
inquiring about help with app building,
28:41
including moving an app from Google
28:43
Studio to Firebase." And then it went
28:45
ahead and extracted the list of
28:47
questions from this email. It says, "Is
28:49
this something you are doing?" And then
28:51
clarified what that actually means. And
28:53
then, "Do you charge hourly for support
28:55
and education help?" We did a great job
28:57
here. And then I went on to step five to
28:59
draft the actual response with Gemini.
29:01
Now I'm not very happy with the style of
29:03
it. It's very formal. It says, "Dear
29:05
client." So later on I'm going to go to
29:07
step five and modify the style to be
29:09
more casual. But when it comes to the
29:11
structure of it and actual responses,
29:13
it's very good. It used my actual
29:15
knowledge base to answer the questions.
29:17
Now all I have to do is just go to the
29:19
drafts folder every couple of hours,
29:21
check the responses, and just send them
29:23
out. and that's going to save me so much
29:25
time responding to the same questions.
